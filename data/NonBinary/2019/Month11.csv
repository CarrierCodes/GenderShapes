killing time for a while, i pulled out my phone outside some random Dunkin donuts to figure out how far I was from the theater. my guard was down. first mistake. out of nowhere, some random guy on the street starts trying to talk at me. Not to me, at me. again. ive learned from all the other times that i should just ignore it, but it still startled me. 

without thinking, i took off my headphones (which I wear for exactly this reason, but apparently he didn't take the hint) and asked him what he wanted. second mistake. he yelled, ""YOU'RE A GIRL, RIGHT?"" i was only 2 feet away, but he yelled as if I was across the street. naturally, i froze. this shouldn't be complicated. but suddenly years of stress and confusion started bubbling up and i honestly didn't know how to respond.

stunned, i croaked, ""I don't know."" third mistake. actually, i do know. i know better than anyone. but in that moment, i wasn't answering his question. i was answering a more pressing question in my head, ""how do you explain being non-binary to a stranger?"". i really don't know. 

he paused, confused by my answer.

He lowered his head and shot me a sarcastic look, like I should know better. Then, while opening the door to the Dunkin donuts, he uttered, as a matter of fact, ""I figured."" then he left, just as quickly as he appeared, like a ghost. how apropos. the encounter sure did haunt me.

2019-11-01 08:17:04,dq1c0w,0,2,"I don't know what in the world to do, I feel like I'm in an impossible situation and every possible answer is wrong.


I've known I was non-binary my whole life, and after holding it in for 33 years I just couldn't take it anymore and came out to my wife.  We have 3 kids and I have a crazy career.  Her stance is that my ""queerness"" has no place in our family life and none of our friends or family can know. Furthermore,  she has been very clear that if anyone finds out she will immediately file for divorce. 


This leaves me in an impossible situation.  I'm relegated to taking overnight trips here and there and occasionally heading into the city for an evening so that I can have a little time to be out as my true self- but I feel so isolated when I do this. Not only am I away from everyone I love when I'm out, but I feel like I can't make any friends or build relationships because I'm living a double life and I'd just come across as a phony. 


I wish so much I could be my true self in my family,  social, and work life but I just can't. And I can't bear the idea of losing my family.  So what the hell do i do? Should i just accept that being able to be my true self is just not in the cards for me? And just suffer through the rest of my life?  


I really need some guidance,  has anyone been in a situation? I've been an emotional wreck over this since coming out 9 months ago- battling depression, anxiety,  and panic attacks.  I want so badly to be my true self,  and I want so badly to hold onto my family and friends.  What do I do? Where do i turn?

My name is Jessica Taylor and I am currently reading for my doctorate in counselling psychology with the University of West England. My email address is [Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk](mailto:Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk) (for verification). I'm a (binary) transwoman and am looking to explore non-binary individuals experiences of their bodies. To this end I have obtained permission from the mods to post my survey [here](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Tgy71QzzRx6eW1?fbclid=IwAR03ttpvsz_oygS0MC6SZNG24SDkm9ZdRuwjoQIJUwVBEp3z_y4YWj8cosU).

I have previously worked with the non-binary community to explore their experience of being non-binary (without the focus on their bodies), with this work being published in the *International Journal of Transgenderism* (a copy of which is available, upon request, to anyone over at my [researchgate page](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jessica_Taylor73)). This current research is aimed at getting more of a non-binary voice into the research on non-binary identity, so any interest would be welcome.

The survey itself is qualitative in nature - so it's all about the collection of rich descriptions (in other words, if you choose to complete it, write as much as you can muster!) and you don't have to complete it all in one sitting - you can come back to it anytime within a two week period. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have, or to make any further amendments here if the mods feel them necessary.

2019-11-02 17:16:03,dqn6rw,5,18,"So I realized I was gender nonconforming/genderqueer/nonbinary about four years ago. I always knew I wasn't trans, but I've never felt ""female"", more just nothing. I have the words now to explain how I've always felt.

This realization happened in the course of a fight with my spouse. A child at a school I worked at was outed by a volunteer parent made employee mid year and she sent a staff wide email saying that because of a trans gender 7 year old going to our school all of the girls were at risk of rape in the bathrooms. Never mind that the kid was using the single stall bathroom in the nurse's office to make herself more comfortable.

I was livid. My husband asked what was wrong. I explained and he got mad at me. ""I agree with the coworker. That family is abusing their kid and they are going to grow up messed up.""

I got even more angry, said I felt like that as a kid, and I feel like I grew up messed up. Apparently this threatened his fragile masculinity and he screamed at me. We had never fought like that and haven't since. I've definitely wanted to leave since then, but can't yet.

So that was a long introduction. I've been working at a different school for the past two years with two great guys. It's very small. My older coworker explained he doesn't care for the transgender stuff because he doesn't believe in gender norms anyhow. He feels masculine, but has performed ballet, and humans are kind of dumb for ascribing gender roles to the things we do anyhow. I can respect that because I feel much the same way. We talked after I came out to him.

My younger coworker was more sheltered and was talking about arguing in a college class that gender is set by chromosomes and there is a binary. I discussed and shared a lot of resources with him, but he got uncomfortable and shut down. He didn't bring it up for a while. Then he was helping me set up my classroom this summer and mentioned his fiancee's sister was going into 9th grade. She was coming out as nonbinary and he and his fiancee were struggling at being supportive. I told him I was nonbinary and we just talked a little bit, but it made me feel so happy!

I spent a weekend with them at a MagicFest event. I noticed one of the organizers had their pronouns under their name tag. However they physically presented as male and had a feminine name and she/her pronouns. Apparently the Magic the Gathering community and Wizards of the Coast has a lot of trans and nonbinary people and my older coworker mentioned this later. We started talking about the organizer and I said it made me happy to see them use their desired name and pronouns.

My coworkers were like, ""Yeah, that's fine, but why? Why go to the trouble if you aren't going to try and look the way you say you feel on the inside? It's weird.""

That was several weeks ago, and at the time we were walking and I am slow and can't articulate my thoughts well while moving. Nobody owes them ""passing"" and that's what they were alluding to. I present female because my stupid body would be hella uncomfortable to really try to ""pass"" as male. I'm not male. I'm not female. I'm just me and I wear what feels and looks nice. Plus, a dress is one less piece of clothing to not get dirty.

I don't know if I should or how to bring this back up, but it's been in the back of my mind. I love and trust my coworkers and think they will understand and be supportive over time. I told my husband I've felt like separating since our fight and he said he doesn't understand why I don't feel female, but he loves me, and is sorry he screamed at me.

I\'m not female. I\'m just me and I wear what feels and looks nice. Plus, a dress is one less piece of clothing to not get dirty.\n\nI don\'t know if I should or how to bring this back up, but it\'s been in the back of my mind. I love and trust my coworkers and think they will understand and be supportive over time. I told my husband I\'ve felt like separating since our fight and he said he doesn\'t understand why I don\'t feel female, but he loves me, and is sorry he screamed at me.

2019-11-02 19:06:51,dqos4w,2,6,"Hello! I'm just going to start word vomiting and hope that someone can help me make sense of everything &lt;3

I'm in my late 20s and AFAB. I'm positive that I'm not a trans man. I think I may be non-binary but I'm not sure. I grew up as a  ""tomboy"" And have always been interested in more ""masculine"" hobbies. But I also love makeup. I have days where I want to dress more masculine and days where I want to curl my hair and wear floral dresses. My very curvy body prevents me (in my own mind) from ever presenting more masculine, but I often think  if I were thinner or had a less curvy body, that I would love to present more masculine on occasion. I naturally have a deeper voice and more than average body hair.

At least since I was in middle school I've day dreamed about having a penis but never wanting it to replace my vulva/vagina. I either think of having both or wishing so badly that it was possible to take a pill to change my body at will. Sometimes with the thought of changing my genitals and sometimes with having a complete male body for a day. I've always had high libido so I've always chocked this feeling up to being nothing more than a sexual fantasy.

I've read about how some non-binary individuals have body dismorphia or get very bothered if someone misgenders them. For me, I don't feel that I completely hate a part of my body - I just wish I could add to it or change it at will. And as far as gender goes.. ""I don't really care"" is the best way I can describe it. As stated before, I don't feel like I could (currently) successfully represent as masculine, but if I were to and someone called me ""he"" it might make me a little giddy? But I have no real issue with Being called ""she"".  When I hear someone call me ""she/her"" I do have this small moment in my mind that is hard to explain. It's almost like it takes me a second to realize it's me that they're talking about. My brain - ""She who?.. Oh! Me. Right."" But it doesn't irk me or upset me. And I'm completely fine with ""they"".

I imagine that I would be cool, in general, with she/they pronouns. And I wouldn't be bothered by ""he"" if I ever felt like I could present myself that way. But there's a part of me that feels like a ""fake"" because I'm AFAB, and in a long term relationship with a cis man. I already struggle with feeling valid because I'm pansexual but am ""straight presenting"" as far as my relationship goes. And I for sure look female.

I guess I'm just wanting some sort of insight? Validation? Seeing if there are others that feel the same as me?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. It means so much to me. &lt;3

2019-11-03 01:07:26,dqtkre,5,29,"Hey, I'm Syd, Nonbinary. They/Them. I kinda just had an Epiphone today and needed to vent this somewhere and I thought I would reach out to the diverse community of people who experience gender both similarly and extremely different from how I do. 

For context, my upbringing is such a common ""Trans"" experience. I had a gender neutral name and I loved it for that. My favorite color was green because it was for both ""girls and boys"". I had a really stereotypically gender-neutral taste in hobbies+interests (dogs, drawing, video games). I used to always wonder why I was put into female situations all the time, but never questioned it hard because ""I'm not a dude, right?"" and had to be taught I was a girl and wondered where the ""third option"" was for bathrooms as a five year old. 

I got really uncomfortable with my chest and I didn't like the fact I wasn't allowed to cut my hair as a kid. I started loose binding when I was 13 with layers and sports bras. I even thought I was a trans guy at one point because the idea of me being a girl for the rest of my life felt uncomfortable, only to further realize that being treated as a dude didn't feel like me either. 

Even though I didn't have the ""I wanna be a boy"" or ""what if I'm a boy"" thoughts, I did have basically a trans-nonbinary childhood. I just never saw myself as a boy or a girl. I felt null and unaligned from the idea of gender, but I knew for other people gender was important to them (and it is for me too, even with my inability to relate to binary genders). 

This was confusing and I got into trans youtubers. I found a couple trans-medicalist youtubers and have been following them for a while. They kept iterating how you need dysphoria to be trans while also mocking nonbinary people. I felt conflicted but continued watching because well... many nonbinary people express their gender so differently to how I do and sometimes what other nonbinary people do would make me feel dysphoric. I unfortunately adopted this mindset that too many people appropriate the nonbinary label just because they're GNC and that you need dysphoria to be trans. 

But today I watched this video where there was a trans woman that had transitioned over ten years ago and she had to go through a lot to get to the point where she is now. She explained how much easier it is for trans people to access resources now than it was for her, and how truscum tend to promote this definist fallacy that cis people will accept them just because they are able to explain their identity in a way that might make sense to a cis person. After I finally got that explanation instead of just hearing the common ""truscum are awful uwu""  or ""you don't need dysphoria to be trans."" It finally got explained to me in a way that makes sense. 

I see it a lot like how you don't need Major Depressive Disorder to have Depression. People with depression as just as valid to seek therapy or other resources to alleviate their mental illness. If you don't have what qualifies in the medical field as gender dysphoria, but transitioning will ultimately better your life and/or you feel more comfortable just knowing there's a word that describes your experience with gender, you're nonbinary enough.

Are you a parent or prospective parent? Do you identify as non-binary, gender-nonconforming, genderqueer, and/or gender fluid? If so, you might be able to participate in a paid Harvard study examining the experiences of GNC parents. **Confidentiality is guaranteed, and $20/hr compensation is provided for a casual interview.**

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals navigate their parent identity, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or cis gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.

I've never felt like my gender was an important part of my life; I just kind of conformed because it was convenient. For the record, I am ""biologically male"" and use he/him pronouns.

&amp;#x200B;

In my youth, I never felt like I had any similarities with boys my age. I was bullied relentlessly in middle school for being ""gay"" because I was effeminate. Around that same age, I would often fantasize about living life as a woman. But I’ve always seen myself more in female or nb characters in fiction and recently I’ve been wanting to look more androgynous or feminine, or at least change my rather bland t-shirt/polo/jacket and jeans look into something more stylish. Also, people call me ma'am at work often, something that I often bring up to my friend, and only recently did it occur to me that I might be fixated on it because I kind of like it, to not be immediately considered male.

When I told my (queer) roommate and best friend this, she was generally supportive, and told me that there are no qualifiers for being a man, woman, or NB, beyond feeling that you are that. But she also said that I might be coming from a place of ""privileged progressiveness,"" and some of what she said rang true. She noted that I often refer to one of my friends as my ""trans friend,"" something which I never realized but I of course see how that's gross, and that I have often fixated on trans angst or persecution when writing trans characters in my fiction in the past (which I feel bad about), and she worries that I may be fetishizing trans people. But she also noted that underlying gender issues might be behind this fixation, too. 

I realize that being a straight man who is not traditionally masculine does not inherently make me NB or trans.

i decided some time ago that i want to come out to her in one of my therapy sessions as it’s a safe space for me and my therapist will be able to answer any questions i may be unable to.  i’ve discussed this with my therapist an she’s happy for me to do this. the only issue i’m facing is coming up with the language to come out to my mom with. gender has been a struggle for me for some time but i’ve come to the conclusion i’m something along the lines of transfem non binary (i’m amab, for reference).

i’m stuck on how to come out as i know flat out telling her i’m non binary will probably lead to some confusion on her half, however its the most direct route. on the other hand, i could tell her i’m trans, which is not 100% accurate but it’s something she’ll understand easier as she’s much more familiar with the language.

thing is, i know very little about the whole subject, and im kind of a bit paranoid of googling all this stuff, i would love to know more from other nonbinary folk - how does 'low' or 'temporary' doses of HRT work? i'm not quite sure i understand, but it sounds like it might be ideal for me, to have low-dose T (or however it's referred to)? what happens when you stop? etc.

i want my voice to change, i want facial hair, i want my body in general to be more androgynous. while im fine with my boobs, i did use to bind them, so having less of them really isn't a concern to me. i don't fully understand bottom changes either but i don't think i'm terribly bothered by them. all i know is i really don't want to go FULL T, i want to be androgynous, not necessarily masc-passing, you know? but especially as of the last 6 months this urge to go on HRT has been getting to me, even triggering dysphoria i was previously fine with, so i wanted to come and ask on this reddit?

additionally, has anyone had experience with HRT within the UK? i am part of a LGBTQ+ group in my city, but i haven't had the courage to talk to a counsellor about it just yet, as i don't know exactly what it is i'm looking for. any advice at all would be really helpful, any anecdotes or even just explaining HRT to me like i'm 5 (jk.... or am i?)

for more context i am 20, turning 21 in april. while in the UK, our public healthcare is a bit of a mess right now, i am eligible for free prescriptions (under a HC2, a form of benefits), i'm not sure whether that would apply to HRT but i'm throwing it out there just incase. thank you for any responses, in advance!!",NonBinary,AFAB NB - Seriously considering HRT?,1572950463.0,"{'created_utc': 1572925263, 'id': 'drtm2j', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""hi there! my name's V, i've identified as nonbinary for about 8 years now and my presentation has really gone all over the place, but something thats always been a bit of a constant is i feel i want some kind of HRT. \n\nthing is, i know very little about the whole subject, and im kind of a bit paranoid of googling all this stuff, i would love to know more from other nonbinary folk - how does 'low' or 'temporary' doses of HRT work? i'm not quite sure i understand, but it sounds like it might be ideal for me, to have low-dose T (or however it's referred to)? what happens when you stop? etc.\n\ni want my voice to change, i want facial hair, i want my body in general to be more androgynous. while im fine with my boobs, i did use to bind them, so having less of them really isn't a concern to me. i don't fully understand bottom changes either but i don't think i'm terribly bothered by them. all i know is i really don't want to go FULL T, i want to be androgynous, not necessarily masc-passing, you know? but especially as of the last 6 months this urge to go on HRT has been getting to me, even triggering dysphoria i was previously fine with, so i wanted to come and ask on this reddit?\n\nadditionally, has anyone had experience with HRT within the UK? i am part of a LGBTQ+ group in my city, but i haven't had the courage to talk to a counsellor about it just yet, as i don't know exactly what it is i'm looking for. any advice at all would be really helpful, any anecdotes or even just explaining HRT to me like i'm 5 (jk.... or am i?)\n\nfor more context i am 20, turning 21 in april. while in the UK, our public healthcare is a bit of a mess right now, i am eligible for free prescriptions (under a HC2, a form of benefits), i'm not sure whether that would apply to HRT but i'm throwing it out there just incase. thank you for any responses, in advance!!"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'AFAB NB - Seriously considering HRT?', 'created': 1572950463.0}"

I have written about nb people in the past, but usually they were genderfluid or bigender, people that preferred he/him and she/her, because German honestly doesn't have gender neutral options that I like.

So I decided that I need to suck it up and research what neopronouns my language even has that I can pronounce without having a stroke. I finally settled on ""ind"", and I honestly quite like it.

I just hate, hate, HATE GERMAN GRAMMAR!! Like holy shit it's way harder than it should be to remember all the forms. There are 20 different forms, and although most have some overlaps and several forms are used twice, that really doesn't make it easier.

I literally leave a screenshot of the grammatically correct forms pulled up on my phone while writing, and it's ridiculous how often I have to check.

I feel a bit defeated and kind of understand why no one made the effort to introduce actual gender neutral pronouns into our language. That shit is way harder than it should be.

2019-11-06 03:38:21,dsam8x,6,8,"Hi, this is my first reddit post so bare with me please. Later on in this post I am going to be talking about a bad experience I had in response to coming out as a nonbinary lesbian, which may be distressing.

I’ve identified as a cisgender lesbian for the past few years. I’ve always felt very solid in being a lesbian, but this past year I’ve had some realizations about my gender identity. While I’m still figuring a lot out, I came to the conclusion that I identify as a nonbinary lesbian. I do still feel aligned with womanhood to a certain extent, and while I questioned this for a long time, doing some reading about women-aligned nonbinary folks gave me a lot of clarity. I was happy to find a label that I felt described me well. I told a few trans friends of mine who live in different cities and they also provided me with a lot of guidance in figuring things out. 

From there I thought the next step would be to tell my girlfriend. We’ve been dating for a little under a year and she means the world to me. I’ve always been careful in assessing the quality of our relationship and it has always felt very healthy. She is cisgender and generally describes herself as either bisexual or queer, though she identified as a lesbian for a long time. She is generally very aware about social issues so I did not think coming out to her would be a problem. Today I told her that I think I’m nonbinary. I think she was surprised at first, but she said okay and told me that she supports me. I then told her that I’m still figuring everything out and that I still feel like a lesbian. At this point she had some reservations. 

She is of the mindset that you can either be nonbinary or a woman and that there is no overlap between them, so it doesn’t make sense to claim to be a nonbinary lesbian. She was “irked” (her word) at the idea of nonbinary people “appropriating” (also her word) lesbianism because to her, it’s something inherently tied to binary womanhood. She said that she felt like claiming to be a nonbinary lesbian was like getting something that was a benefit of womanhood (ie the joys of being a wlw) without having the responsibility of womanhood (ie protecting other women). I tried explaining a lot of different things, including that  I would never stop protecting women, that nonbinary isn’t just a third gender, and that I still experience oppression under misogyny. Her response to the last one was that because I’m nonbinary, it’s oppression in a different way, and thus doesn’t mean that I should be able to claim womanhood if I don’t fully align with it. I think it’s important to note that she could not provide a clear definition of womanhood. She said the whole thing was a matter of community. She was respectful and never blatantly demeaning, but the whole thing was very distressing to say the least. I’m not out to anyone else in my town, so I’m kind of desperate for support here. 

The problem isn’t inherently in me being nonbinary, but rather in me being a nonbinary lesbian. She agreed to read more on the topic, so I scoured online for a while and sent her a few links. She is not a close minded person, just a little stubborn, so I’m not feeling hopeless about the whole situation. I just don’t think I have a good way to describe my gender identity to make it make sense to her, which brings me to why I’m here. I want to explain in a way that addresses her idea of binary women and nonbinary people as completely separate, which brings me to the point of this whole post:

2019-11-06 04:03:26,dsawba,3,6,"Hi  all, just got a throwaway account to post here (not much of a reddit  person, but excited about the community). I'm sort of in the midst of  questioning my gender identity &amp; I guess I'm just curious if others  have had my experiences/see if there are some common threads?  Anyway,  this is kind of a long essay, so buckle up! I really hope some of y'all  take the time to read it though. TL;DR older afab person identified as  butch for a long time, now wondering about being genderqueer, would love  to get advice and guidance (or even just support and recognition) from  people who've experienced similar things! 

I'm  afab and have been a ""tomboy"" pretty much my whole life. I'm in my  early 30s and when I was growing up, in high school and college and  such, i was exposed to binary trans identities (in fact, my best friend  from high school transitioned FTM shortly after we graduated) and LGBTQ+  identities, but genderqueer/NB wasn't really a ""thing"" so much. In  college I pretty comfortably fell into the box of being a butch bi  woman, and gave myself permission to lean hard into the butchness after I  graduated. Recently, i've come to realize, mostly from knowing and  interacting with some younger queers, that if I had been born five or  ten years later, and grown up with this current generation, that I think  I would have identified as genderqueer. I feel like I fell into being a  butch woman because that was the best word I had to describe myself at  the time, but now maybe there are better words?

Only  now, have I started to really think about my relationship with my  gender. At first I was like, I can't be genderqueer, I'm definitely a  woman. But then I asked myself why I thought i was a woman (a question  which, believe it or not, I have never before felt comfortable  addressing) and I realized that the only times I really feel a strong  allegience to my gender at birth are when i feel discriminated against  or bullied because of my sex. Essentially, I only ever feel like a woman  when I realize I'm afraid to walk somewhere alone after dark and my cis  male friends aren't, or when I am at my job (in a very male dominated  field) and someone makes a sexist remark. This last part is especially  complicated for me, because this female solidarity has been very  important for me in getting through the training process at my job and  dealing with harrasment, and that kind of solidarity is something I  wouldn't want to give up if I embraced a genderqueer identity. But, when  I look inside myself, I really don't feel any particuar way about  gender. I don't feel like a woman at all. I don't feel like a man  either. If someone were to say to me, don't think about how others treat  you, just think about yourself, how do you know you're a woman? My  honest answer would just be, I don't.

After  a few months of such questioning, I started experimenting a bit with  presentation. I have always been quite butch, but never done much to  hide feminine elements of my body, and whenever I've had to go to a  formal event, I've worn a dress. In fact, I've always hated formal  events because they require navigating female formal wear, which has  always generated terrible feelings that I now recognize may have been  dysphoria. This summer, i went to a friend's wedding in a suit and I  felt glorious. I felt really handsome, like I looked good, a way I never  feel when I wear a dress. After a month of experimenting with sports  bras, I bought my first binder and found I enjoyed the look some days,  but not others (I'm small chested to begin with, but the way the binder  reduced my chest to nothing felt amazing on days when I wanted it). I  also started letting my body hair grow out, which I've been less  comfortable with (perhaps because it pushes my look over the androgenous  line and too far into male territory?).

Also  an NSFW addition \[mods please tell me if this paragraph doesn't abide  by group rules, I'll delete it--not meant to be explicit, just a part of  my experience that's been really important\] I started having strap on  sex, and holy fuck it's awesome. I've used a strap on before in several  previous relationships, but its always been one that's colorful and not  really dick shaped (#feminism lol). Even though I've been wearing it,  it's always been for my partner's pleasure if that makes sense, just  like, a more efficient way to use a toy, not a part of me. Well, this  summer I invested in a dick of my own, that looks about the same color  as my skin, and I...absolutely love it. Its not the only way I enjoy  having sex, but using it, solo or with my (cis male bisexual) partner  when I'm in the right mood has been amazing.

So,  all this to say, I'm excited about this journey. I still sometimes  wonder if I'm allowed the label of genderqueer. Am I just a butch woman?  I think a lot of this self doubt comes from being a bit older than most  of the people I see using the genderqueer label, and from feeling like I  just want to be me, and I don't want it to be like...a political label.  Also, I am all for other people using they/them pronouns, but I just  can't wrap my head around it for myself. Perhaps after 30 years of  thinking she/her, it's just a habit I won't be able to break? I've heard  from others that you don't need to use they/them pronouns to be NB or  genderqueer, but it still really makes me sad when I'm in ""woke"" spaces  and we go around and say our pronouns and I feel like saying ""she/her""  will imply to everyone else in the circle that I'm comfortable being a  woman (\*yes I know about the Contrapoints controversy kicked off by a  similar statement, and I'm in no way saying that pronoun go arounds are  bad, just that for me in particular, at this stage in my journey, they  are the opposite of validating!)

Anyway,  advice/thoughts/encouragement is welcome!

""Evelyn Ida Morris' cover of courtney barnett's tune ‘Nameless, Faceless’ from the forthcoming 'Milk on Milk' compilation is out now! Here's some words from Evelyn on the track...

“Courtney's song Nameless Faceless stood out as an obvious choice for me, mainly based on its content. I have really strong feelings about that fear that women have to carry. That silent, creeping fear that most women - especially trans women and women of colour - suffer through their whole lives. I had tried writing about this in a song maybe four years ago, when there was yet another incident of violence against a woman walking through a park in Doncaster, nearby where I grew up. I didn't release it, because I had struggled to make the topic feel like something I was proud of proclaiming in a chorus - which I think Courtney's song does beautifully. Before I knew I was non-binary, it was tricky proclaiming anything related to women because I didn't feel like I succeed at being a woman. It struck me that singing along with Courtney's song while also proclaiming my status as ""in-between"" was the perfect way to show my support to women, and to engage with the feeling that is inherent in my gender identity: that being a woman is a dangerous feeling for me. It is impossible for me to extricate the feeling of terror around having a body that is assigned female from the feeling of danger related to toxic masculinity - that moment we all experienced when we were little children, when suddenly we are told we can't take our shirt off in public, that we need to cover our bodies so that we are safe. We all walk through the world with this inherited trauma from our mothers, aunties, grandmothers and beyond - the pain they have felt at the hands of the patriarchy. It feels so natural and good to sing about it, so I really appreciated this opportunity to do so. I recorded it myself, because it felt right to take such a personal experience of the song to a private space. It took a long while to feel confident with my arrangement, but I am so proud of where it ended up.”""  


I know that I'm trans, but I'm not sure yet where I fit in on the spectrum. I think Morris's words  describe why I feel more non-binary than binary. Although I want to be read as a guy by others, I don't feel like one. The trauma of living as a woman, or at least of living as someone who is perceived as one, is so ingrained in me that I think it will always be part of me. I don't think I could ever fully feel like a man because of this. Sometimes I think that I'm trans because the burdens of being a woman have gotten too exhausting, but of course the irony is that being trans is worse in terms of stigma and danger.

2019-11-07 11:38:27,dswimp,4,1,"This may sound quite odd but I don't have any friends I'm comfortable to talk about something so personal to me...

Starting off, I'm a 20M Asian gay guy who I can self-describe myself as softly effeminate, reserved and soft-spoken. Recently, I've been having growing feelings of the desire for people, mainly guys, to treat me as a straight female. The best I could explain it is with how some women wanting to be treated by their male friends like fellow 'bros' or 'homies', it's a reverse sentiment for myself, wanting my male friends and also guys in general to see me as a woman.

As a guy, I never hold many traits that I could consider masculine and I feel more comfortable being in touch with traits considered feminine. For one, I crave deep-rooted intimacy with my male friends and extremely affectionate with guys in general (when receptive or asked). I feel like I want to be nurturing, supportive... loving (not to reminisce a 1950s handmaids tale mind you). A guy I talked to online a while ago had once told me that: ""I have a mindset of a female"" (when I inquired why guy friends don't do platonic cuddling and I argued they should) and a good (straight) male friend to tell me that ""I make him warm and cozy"". Seeing it as a complement personally, it warms my heart and maybe it makes sense.

Strangely, I don't have any active desires to do makeup, crossdress or go out of my way to physically look like a woman as far as by undergoing an MtF transition but I like to being referred to as the woman especially when it comes to any preferred pronouns as ""she"" etc. (I don't mind with male pronouns). I've also started to give myself a name for my female persona... wanting to be called Cassie or Cassandra).

It may seem I'm purely romanticizing the woman experience by having guys fawn over females, but with my feminine traits, I'd want to use it to melt a man's heart, to make him more emotionally vulnerable and having that reciprocated when it comes to sharing personal things, whether it'd be just platonic or romantic.

In return, I want to be safe, feeling protected and the feeling that I matter to a guy.

To give a sense of the level of intimacy, I'm very open-minded and comfortable with... putting my head on a guy's chest... playing with his chest hair and listening to his heartbeat and deep breathing, being kissed on my forehead from time to time, sitting on a guy's lap to holding hands (which the same straight male friend asked me once and I didn't think anything of it)

Recently, I\'ve been having growing feelings of the desire for people, mainly guys, to treat me as a straight female. The best I could explain it is with how some women wanting to be treated by their male friends like fellow \'bros\' or \'homies\', it\'s a reverse sentiment for myself, wanting my male friends and also guys in general to see me as a woman.\n\nAs a guy, I never hold many traits that I could consider masculine and I feel more comfortable being in touch with traits considered feminine. For one, I crave deep-rooted intimacy with my male friends and extremely affectionate with guys in general (when receptive or asked). I feel like I want to be nurturing, supportive... loving (not to reminisce a 1950s handmaids tale mind you). A guy I talked to online a while ago had once told me that: ""I have a mindset of a female"" (when I inquired why guy friends don\'t do platonic cuddling and I argued they should) and a good (straight) male friend to tell me that ""I make him warm and cozy"". Seeing it as a complement personally, it warms my heart and maybe it makes sense.\n\nStrangely, I don\'t have any active desires to do makeup, crossdress or go out of my way to physically look like a woman as far as by undergoing an MtF transition but I like to being referred to as the woman especially when it comes to any preferred pronouns as ""she"" etc. (I don\'t mind with male pronouns). I\'ve also started to give myself a name for my female persona... wanting to be called Cassie or Cassandra).\n\nIt may seem I\'m purely romanticizing the woman experience by having guys fawn over females, but with my feminine traits, I\'d want to use it to melt a man\'s heart, to make him more emotionally vulnerable and having that reciprocated when it comes to sharing personal things, whether it\'d be just platonic or romantic.

I feel like I’m being treated like a woman by the cis men I work with.

2019-11-08 08:19:33,dtcfg8,8,1,"Cw: Non-binaryphobia(?), Christianity, dysphoria, abuse, depression, self-hatred

I had an actual discussion with my boyfriend about my identity in a phone call today. It was interesting because when I brought it up briefly in person, he seemed reserved and didn't actually want to tell me anything. He just had this face of disappointment. He told me he didn't really want me to change my body if I ever came to that decision. But now that we REALLY talked about it, he tells me that he's not buying into the whole ""more than one gender"" thing, that he's old school and proud. I have my own reservations about that but that's neither here nor there. What really got to me is that he said I was just confused, just tomboyish. I told him that part of my identity is partial agender and partial feminine, that it's not about being more boyish and less girly - I just wish I could be less gendered period. Then he says I'm not agender, I'm androgynous but that's not how I see myself as. Then he said that I was born a girl, I am his girlfriend. It hurt me so much but I'm still not 100% sure about using shey/shem/sheir pronouns so it's not like it matters.

If my boyfriend were any other guy, I'd have dumped him on the spot. But we truly love eachother, even despite... this. He told me straight up that he would support me as much as he could. So then I asked him pointblank if I were to get surgery, would he dump me. He said that he wouldn't mind as long as the surgery didn't turn me into an alien and made me look completely different where I was unrecognizable. He likes my body as it is but *I* don't. Unlike most people of his viewpoint, he doesn't want to disown me. He still loves me despite my dysphoria and not understanding non-binary. He said that he doesn't need to understand, he just refuses to accept the ""bull"". He thinks society has confused me. He believes God made me as I am. I'm a Christian but even with our beliefs in God, we don't see exactly eye to eye. Still, I DO believe that God doesn't make mistakes; hence why I still partially identify as female. But that doesn't change the fact that I am dysphoric about my body and feel like a prisoner in it.

Realistically, surgery is WAY too big of decision to make right now but the main issue of my dysphoria is weight so I'm hoping once I've got that under control, I can take care of other stuff. My other problem that is related (but not directly) is libido. It's part of my dysphoria and why I see myself as agender but I'm hoping that exercise will dim it enough to stop being a problem. And if it doesn't... Then I'm gonna have to find another solution or go straight for chemical castration. I'm too large to bind but if my breasts prove too unhealthy for my small frame and back, then I definitely want to get a reduction if I can. I'd like them gone period but that might be asking for too much anyway (not to mention it'd upset my boyfriend).

I wish I had never brought it up to my babe but I'm thankful for having someone in my life that cares about me. I'd rather have him than anyone else; I'd been waiting for him to return to me after we broke up years ago. We needed a fresh start and I wasn't as dysphoric about my gender back then. But now that I had this discussion, I'm questioning whether or not I'm truly non-binary or if I'm just clinging to demigirl as a way to visualizing my dysphoria; there's so much about my body that I'm dysphoric about that goes beyond gender. It's just made me even more confused - which makes me think he's right. I don't know what to do. I'm at the point where I just want to call myself body dysphoric, abandon all the stuff I identified as, and be done with it. I hurt so much and I'm at a loss. I'm just in a perpetual of self-loathing and have been for years (having an abusive stepmother who, among other things, forced femininity upon me as well as called me worthless didn't help). Even after I've moved far away from her, my own mother is just as deadset on her beliefs as my boyfriend but is a bit more accepting than him. I feel so alone (even though I'm surrounded by so many folk so feel as I do) and outnumbered. I'm just trapped; trapped inside a body that isn't mine. I told my boyfriend that and all he could say was that we would one day be in new bodies when God returns. I mean, I believe that but that doesn't help me in the moment.

Sorry if I'm rambling a bit, I just had to get this out, and this subreddit seems the right space. I still have difficulty finding the right words, as you might notice. 

I only recently accepted that i'm probably non-binary. I think i knew before, I just couldn't acknowledge it, if that makes sense? Instead I told myself at 17 that it doesn't matter what I am, as long as I am myself and do what I like. Well, it turned out that I liked to wear more masculine clothes, and present more androgynous. A month ago i cut my hair short, and I actually feel much more myself.

But the more I accept that I'm not a girl, the more I am getting bothered by the fact that others still percieve me as a girl. I get more aware of my body and often feel uncomfortable with the more feminine parts. Have any of you experienced the same after discovering that you're non binary? How did you deal with it?

I also don't really know what to do now. I have some friends I probably can talk with, but I don't really know how to approach this subject.

I have this sudden desire to pack and bind and I'm soooo confused  


Figured out I was nonbinary about 3 years ago. Mostly suffer from social dysphoria - don't want to be perceived as a woman, or femme, or female. Don't want to be perceived as a man, or masc, or male. Don't perceive my body as gendered, so not a lot of body or genital dysphoria. I mean it'd be fun to have all the bits, but I don't feel like I'll die if I don't have them. I don't have any chest dysphoria that I'm aware of. Mostly I have strong 'PLEASE DO NOT BINARY GENDER ME' feels that can be really really rough. Like 'I cannot leave the house or wear the skirts I love cause people will think I'm a woman so I wear a pronoun badge at all times so I can stand to public' rough.  


So mostly I use just 'nonbinary' cause my answer to 'are you a binary gender' is a huge 'NO' but wondering lately if what I'm describing is closest to 'agender' if I'm gonna be specific. I use genderqueer too cause messing with/fucking with gender is a big part of my presentation I guess? Ugh why is it all so complicated bleh.  


But although I am the first to be like 'presentation isn't gender, there are no masculine or feminine things, you can be nonbinary with any presentation' etc, I've usually had a strong knee jerk 'yerk' about being perceived as masc, and a real stubborn resistance to this whole idea that I gotta lean masc in order to be perceived as nonbinary. 

Buuuuut I have to admit a whole lotta butch women and nonbinary folks are like, presentation goals a bunch of the time for me (K.D. Lang anyone? Oomph what a fox). I am a confused enby I guess.

I do know I was attracted the idea of doing the Drag King thing once upon a time (I sing) but my less-enlightened brain was like 'that's for binary people' (which I know is wrong, now, but that's newish for me) so I wrote it off.

Mostly suffer from social dysphoria - don't want to be perceived as a woman, or femme, or female. Don't want to be perceived as a man, or masc, or male. Don't perceive my body as gendered, so not a lot of body or genital dysphoria. I mean it'd be fun to have all the bits, but I don't feel like I'll die if I don't have them. I don't have any chest dysphoria that I'm aware of. Mostly I have strong 'PLEASE DO NOT BINARY GENDER ME' feels that can be really really rough. Like 'I cannot leave the house or wear the skirts I love cause people will think I'm a woman so I wear a pronoun badge at all times so I can stand to public' rough.  \n\n\nSo mostly I use just 'nonbinary' cause my answer to 'are you a binary gender' is a huge 'NO' but wondering lately if what I'm describing is closest to 'agender' if I'm gonna be specific. I use genderqueer too cause messing with/fucking with gender is a big part of my presentation I guess? Ugh why is it all so complicated bleh.  \n\n\nBut although I am the first to be like 'presentation isn't gender, there are no masculine or feminine things, you can be nonbinary with any presentation' etc, I've usually had a strong knee jerk 'yerk' about being perceived as masc, and a real stubborn resistance to this whole idea that I gotta lean masc in order to be perceived as nonbinary. \n\nBuuuuut I have to admit a whole lotta butch women and nonbinary folks are like, presentation goals a bunch of the time for me (K.D. Lang anyone? Oomph what a fox). I am a confused enby I guess. I love my waistcoats and frock coats and swashbuckling shirts, and don't see them as masculine.

2019-11-08 19:39:05,dtkjk2,2,1,"No flair because the “Yay” tag feels horribly out of place considering context but I guess this is still technically a win, albeit one nestled in sad circumstances.

Came out earlier this year and posted about it on Facebook before coming out to my parents. I love my parents but they made my coming out really...really weird.

They expressed support when I came out over Whatsapp one evening (I still feel like a coward for not being able to tell them in person despite all of us being adults, but frankly I was so scared), but later sat me down for a talk about things that just went *so badly*. Not in a bigoted or dangerous way, but they chose the worst timing for the talk and were clearly struggling with the concept of my not being female. My dad wouldn’t even hug me when I started crying and my mum told him to hug me.

I cried all the way to work and then just kept crying most of the day. Things have been “fine” since  but the subject of my gender or wanting to transition hasn’t come up since. I can’t take the emotional turmoil of a new conversation and nobody’s cared to check in with me on what pronouns or name I want to be using.

Very sadly, a friend of the family died about a week or two ago after years of health problems. We went to his funeral today. He and his wife were good friends of my parents, and their kids thusly became friends with my sibling and I. We’d go and visit the family or they would come to us maybe once a year, before us kids started growing up and had uni, shift work and boyfriends.

Keeping in mind that nobody save for my (Ultimate Of All Allies) boyfriend and one or two good friends gives a single shit about recognising my gender, at the funeral today one of the daughters thought to ask if I was now going by the name I originally came out with on Facebook. It was very awkward...I was caught totally off guard could feel the curious eyes of her other companions on me as I stuttered that I’d changed my mind on the name, but I’m so touched that she thought to check even in her moment of grief.

When I spoke with her mother/the wife of the deceased, she told me she missed seeing me on Facebook, and also asked about what name I was going by. She hugged me tight and told me that she understood and would always love and support me no matter what. I definitely started to get wet eyed all over again.

That talk I had with my folks ruined me on the name I’d chosen for myself and essentially threw a brick in my path since I now feel like I can’t transition while still as home for sake of causing friction. It hurts a lot that I didn’t get that kind of open-armed response from them. But it means so much to know there are people close to my family who do support me. That gives me hope that maybe things will improve in future, if my folks can see that other people have no problem with it...

I’m scared for all the times and ways I’m going to have to come out to people in the future, but I’ll hold our friends’ acceptance close to my heart and draw strength from it knowing that I’m not an unimaginable freak to everybody and that I have people I can turn to if I need it (even if they live hours from us, alas).",NonBinary,Bittersweet experiences at a funeral,1573267145.0,"{'created_utc': 1573241945, 'id': 'dtkjk2', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'No flair because the “Yay” tag feels horribly out of place considering context but I guess this is still technically a win, albeit one nestled in sad circumstances.\n\nCame out earlier this year and posted about it on Facebook before coming out to my parents.

Basically since my GF started transitioning my totally not dysphoria started becoming painfully apparent.

I'm AFAB, and lately some of what we've been trying for her has sort of triggered problems for me while being intimate...

I won't go into long details in a post, but I am realizing I'm uncomfortable with my genitals. Is there any other person who made genital and or top changes without a full on medical transition? (I can't come out to family as enby)

I came across some porn actress's subreddit a while back when trying to search about this and she was using t gel to get bottom growth, but wasn't taking enough to induce other changes (body hair, voice changes etc...). That sounds perfect for now.

From my understanding being nonbinary essentially comes down to ""I use they/them pronouns, I wear whatever I like, don't deadname me, please. and it's not your business to question or comment any of the above other than telling me how fabulous I look in this outfit"" and that's pretty straightforward to learn, If it's anything more or less than that feel free to correct me.

I'm not sure how to tackle the social pressures of being Non-Binary, my stories normally just pretend that everyone is fine with everyone else's gender/race/sexuality because those stories main themes come down to ""don't be a bigoted asshole"". However, since N-B people are rarely addressed in media, would it be more helpful if my story opened up an opportunity for people to be informed about N-B people and how some comments/questions that you think are neutral are actually offensive, Or would it be enough to show people just not being that kind of asshole to begin with?

So what should I do? should I go down the ""don't be a bigot"" route (nothing wrong with it but it should be a given at this point) or should I just assume that my audience already knows what a bigot does and just write my story as if everyone knows what appropriate and inappropriate to ask people except little kids?

2019-11-09 22:20:32,du2pj2,2,1,"Hi, I looked through the rules and didnt see a rule against asking this here, so I hope this is an okay place to ask this question.

I've also searched the wider internet as well as this community and I haven't seen people ask quite this type of detail, which might just be that I did a bad job searching for it.

I'm an AFAB person, I currently identify as a lesbian. I know of nonbinary lesbians so I have this vague knowledge that that's possible/an option. I've dated binary cis and trans women. I would date nonbinary people basically so long as they didn't feel like misgendered by my label and weren't, say, a demi boy or gender fluid and sometimes a man.

If asked on a form, I normally say that I'm a cis woman. I tend to be she/her'ed by people and that doesn't feel bad. I have been he/him'ed by people and that also doesn't feel bad. I haven't really been they/them'ed before but I imagine that would also feel fine. If I am described as a woman by other people, I'm fine with that.

However, as I've been around more progressive groups I find that I really hate saying that I ""identify"" as a woman. It feels to me like gender is a coercive system used to control people. Within that system, I guess I'm a woman bc whatever, but I don't feel like it's an inherent truth in my bones or something. If I hadn't been coercively placed here I wouldn't be here but I guess I am here now.

Like I find myself getting distressed answering that my pronouns are she/her, but I also know that I've seen cis people told not to do the ""any pronoun is fine"" stuff. and if I did that, overwhelmingly I would still be she/her'ed probably.

It's like if you had a shitty person controlling your life for a while and they filled your wardrobe with a single outfit. And technically you could make a different outfit or alter the ones you have or whatever. But it would be a lot of work, so you haven't and you might never do any of that, bc you don't actually care that much about the outfit. But for some reason every day you go out, you felt forced to say that you chose that outfit even when it's not true.

I realized I'm NB/transmasc about 5 months ago and it has just been solidifying since then. I'm 33 and looking back there were signs there throughout the years. I'm AFAB and am now at a point where being referred to as a woman just feels outright wrong. Maybe I'll go back to being that later, I sure hope I do because things were a whole lot easier as cis, but this is where I am now. I feel like I'm weighing the hassle of coming out to the discomfort of not being out, and just waiting for the scale to tip over. I cut my hair and look pretty androgynous, but I still get read as a girl 100% of the time. However I'm not a huge fan of the gender neutral pronouns of my language, and can't decide if I wish to go by he/him instead, so I use this as an excuse to keep stalling until I figure that out.

I was having an argument with her (which is a GREAT start) about intersectionality, and used myself as an example of “why I don’t want a cis/het person to tell me their opinions on issues I face.” She then insisted that it’s toxic gatekeeping that people are allowed to only comment when they are part of a marginalized group (which isn’t what I necessarily said— I said groups should get a priority in voicing their views on the issues they face).

Anyway, she used she/hers (I’m AFAB), after I asked her to use they/them. I then told her why that is toxic and hurtful, but angrily said, “you can’t expect me to get everything right in the beginning.” I’m usually okay with mistakes, I get misgendered all the time, but it was very hurtful that she didn’t even apologize and only made it about herself. After that I told her if she can’t respect that, I don’t want to talk to her. She later said that she always have and always will respect me, and that she would call me whatever I want her to call me. The kicker is, though, instead of apologizing she made it about herself by yelling how supportive she had been for my entire life and that I’m gaslighting her. She also never asked any questions— only ever argued the negatives associated with being queer.

2019-11-11 09:42:37,duq6t4,12,1,"So I've been wondering for about a year now if I might be Non-binary, Gender Fluid, or the like. I've felt this way as long as I can remember, but I can't decide how I actually feel about the validity of the terms themselves. 

On the one hand, it describes an important part of myself pretty well. There are times where I feel dysphoria about my masculine traits, and other times where I love them. Likewise, there are times when I feel euphoric while acting or dressing like a woman, and other times where I'm not into it at all. It's more complicated than that, since it isn't always a simple binary situation, but I think that's the gist of it. I feel like there are two ways I'm supposed to be and it frustrates me that I only get to fully be one way.

On the other, I feel like I'm validating harmful ideas about the gender roles of men and women by giving myself a label like that. I think that shoehorning men and women into specific gender roles is a harmful social construct, and that most men and women wouldn't behave in such a binary way if it weren't for societal pressure. So, shouldn't I just be thinking of myself as a guy...just a different kind of guy, but *not one* that feels like abiding by harmful social constructs?

2019-11-11 19:24:14,duxeau,5,1,"I thought that I'd celebrate FINALLY getting my first dose of T today by writing out my process as a guide for other enbys who may be having trouble figuring out if they want to start HRT and how to go about getting it. Heads up that I live in Massachusetts, one of the most liberal states in the US, so you may face more issues. On mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.

I first brought up wanting to try HRT during my yearly doctor appointment in June. The nurse said they didn't handle HRT stuff, as well as laughed when I mentioned wanting to get sterilized. She did run some blood and thyroid tests that came in handy a couple months later, but overall it was a really dissapointing appointment. I'm honestly happy I plan on moving across country for grad school and will have to get a new doctor.  After that experience I was pretty put off and decided to wait until school started up in the fall to try again.

Once I got to school I decided to try the local Planned Parenthood. If you have a Planned Parenthood near you DEFINITELY go through them! The women on the phone was wonderful when I made the appointment, was super respectful and made sure she was using the proper pronouns and name for me. Honestly the worst part was the my appointment was October 24th, as their HRT doctor was booked until then. So another couple months of waiting.

Onto October 24th. I had to take the day off of classes, and really recommend telling your teachers beforehand that you have a serious medical appointment. They tend to excuse you without asking questions if you phrase it like that. My partner took me since I was nervous and I wanted the support. Once we got to the Planned Parenthood they had the both of us step through a scanner before letting us into the actual clinic. The receptionist took my ID, insurance card, and double checked my preferred pronouns and had me wait for only a few minutes before I was seen.

The appointment itself took about an hour and a half. They took vitals before walking me through all the options of how to take testosterone, and after we chose gel form, explained where to apply it and when. Never was I questioned on my transness or validity of my gender identity. Both the nurse and doctor were respectful the entire time. Since my doctor had run most of the blood and thyroid tests that PP would have run they allowed me to just bring up my online medical records and looked them over there. They didn't have to do any testing that day and I left with prescriptions for birth control and Testogel.

This was honestly the hardest part. My insurance (Aetna) required a prior authorization and denied it when they found out I wasn't binary trans, saying it wasn't an FDA approved usage. Luckily mom had already been switching insurance and November 1st moved us all to Blue Cross Blue Shield, which meant I needed to have Planned Parenthood refile a prior authorization. But this time it was accepted eventually! The next hurdle was the CVS, for some reason they didn't contact me that the gel was ready and I only found out when I called today it had been filled Saturday. The woman who handled me was a little weird about it all and made me consult with the pharmacist, who warned me it may cause my prostate to enlarge and not to let women or children take it lol.

I realize I got lucky that I didn't have to go through all the hoops so many of us have to. I hope that writing out my experience helps someone else get their HRT.

 I was born female and have been fine with that for about 20yrs or so. I have no doubt I'm feminine, I love being feminine. 

So where's the rub? 

Well it all started when I may or may not have used a substance that may or may not have out body elements. While dissociation is a common side effect the things I experienced there and felt have stuck with me ever since. Namely how I kept referring to my name as she/her but me or I was always a different entity. Basically my brain broke things down like this. Sex/genitals = very very bad. Both had gender and neither had anything to do with ""me-ness"" (By the way I already know I'm demisexual/ace spectrum). My name = a girl that I lived with but not me. Me/myself= as a genderless identity just having a good time. And I really ...really really liked that. I shared this experience with my Trans Dad (one of my best friends who also is a trans man and LGBTQ youth counselor). And he just quite frankly said that he never thought of me as Cis but that is wasn't his place to inform me of that. My partner also brought up how I hate the idea of pregnancy, love the idea of raising children with gender, regularly shop among men &amp; womens clothing, and am comfortable going by any pronouns. I've gone by both masculine and feminine nicknames but my favorite is what my D&amp;D party calls me: Bees.  I don't really plan to start going by they/them except maybe with friends, quite frankly I don't care what pronouns anyone calls me. But I like the idea of not being a man or woman but just being...me.

When I came out as bisexual last year she bought me a tie-dye shirt in bi stripes and took me to Pride. I figured if anyone would accept me for being  NB, she would. I came out to her in late September. I was going to wait until Coming Out Day but I was having a panic attack and was seeking sympathy. She seemed to be in denial that Nonbinary was even a thing. She said that young people were rebelling against society and rather than changing my pronouns or appearance, I should change literally all of America (what?). She also implied that, since I'm on a birth control pills (for periods) that my hormones are just out of wack and it's not real. She even said that maybe my medication controlled basically everything I do and am. She agreed to call me by a different name and pronouns but she hasn't tried once. She seems to almost have forgotten, and seems to be calling me ""her girl"" more often. To make it worse, all of the close friends I came out to have completely dipped and I eat lunch alone now.  But this morning was what really made me think that my mom was being intentional in her ignorance. I was filling out a form to apply for a local STEM program, and of course there was a gender question. Last night I spent probably 15 minutes agonizing over it before bubbling the F.

I can try some more androgynous looks like I used to and see how I feel about it. I got the sudden urge to cut off all the hair I grew out over the past two years. But it's come to represent the growth I've achieved since that Bad Time I had. Idk. I thought I was sure about being cis but now I don't know. Plus ever since questioning the first time I haven't been comfortable using my government name. Or any other name  for that matter. Idk. I think the trauma I experienced while I was IDing as NB fucked me up in such a way that I had to reinvent myself. Again. And maybe I left behind more than I should have. \n\nWhat do y'all think?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Some complications with questioning', 'created': 1573733550.0}"

2019-11-14 20:42:01,dwfi6z,0,1,"Hi Folx,

My state just approved a gender of X on photo IDs, woo!  My employer has the policy that you have to use the bathroom matching your ID, which is already a regressive policy, boo!, but on top of that we don't have that many ungendered bathrooms, double boo!  Thankfully, I'm unionized, I trust my union rep to be okay with me coming out to them as nonbinary, and to keep my name private until it's needed, so I wrote them a letter in the hopes that the union can work with my employer to fix this, so I can safely change my ID.

In case anyone else would like to see this letter to use as a model either to their union or to their employer, here it is (appropriately redacted for privacy):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hi *$Name$*,   
&gt;  
&gt;I'm hopeful you'll keep my name confidential from this inquiry for as long as possible.  If you think it would be helpful to disclose my name to anyone, I would appreciate it if you discussed with me beforehand.    
&gt;  
&gt;As you may be aware, the *$State DMV$* has just begun to allow gender markers on driver's ID of not only M (male) and F (female), but also X (nonbinary).  *$Employer$* has previously told us that it is policy that employees should use the bathroom that matches the gender on their photo ID.    
&gt;  
&gt;I am considering changing the gender marker on my driver's license to a gender of X.  This means that if *$employer$* follows the policy above, I would technically be forbidden to use women's restrooms, despite ""looking female"".  But on top of that, it would also be difficult for me to use **any** bathroom: Out of the seven buildings on *$employer's$* main campus, I would only be allowed to use the bathroom in four buildings, and students with an X on their license would have only three bathrooms unless they got faculty/staff permission.  *$Further detail on existing bathrooms that I'd be allowed to use, and about where my office/meetings are located.$*  
&gt;  
&gt;Would it be possible for the union to (1) discuss this issue with the employer, or whomever it is that passed down this rule that we can only use the bathroom that matches the gender on our ID, **and** for the union to (2) get a verbal agreement from the managers that while this is being sorted out, no union members (or ideally, others as well) will be ""no-trespassed"" or otherwise punished for simply using a bathroom (regardless of the bathroom's gender and the person's ID)?   
&gt;  
&gt;What I would like to see long term, is a policy that does both of the following: 

1. Allows people to use whatever bathroom they want, regardless of their gender marker on their ID.  (I'm not out as being nonbinary at work.  If this policy forced me to use only ungendered bathrooms, I would be put in the position of having to choose between violating the policy and risking being ""no-trespassed"", or following the policy and ""outing"" myself which could be unsafe for me.)  
2. Designates one third of bathrooms as being available to all genders (male, female, and nonbinary).  These all gender / gender neutral bathrooms can be either ""single seater"" or ""multi-seater"", so long as they are located at ADA-acceptable distances from all locations, and an ADA-acceptable proportion of them are accessible.  

&gt;This exclusionary bathroom policy at my place of employment is currently the biggest hurdle standing in the way of my correcting my gender on my driver's license.    
&gt;  
&gt;Again, I would prefer if you could keep my name private for the time being, but you can share this email with my name removed.    
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,   
&gt;

Thankfully, I\'m unionized, I trust my union rep to be okay with me coming out to them as nonbinary, and to keep my name private until it\'s needed, so I wrote them a letter in the hopes that the union can work with my employer to fix this, so I can safely change my ID.\n\nIn case anyone else would like to see this letter to use as a model either to their union or to their employer, here it is (appropriately redacted for privacy):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Hi *$Name$*,\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I\'m hopeful you\'ll keep my name confidential from this inquiry for as long as possible.\xa0 If you think it would be helpful to disclose my name to anyone, I would appreciate it if you discussed with me beforehand.\xa0\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As you may be aware, the *$State DMV$* has just begun to allow gender markers on driver\'s ID of not only M (male) and F (female), but also X (nonbinary).\xa0 *$Employer$* has previously\xa0told us that it is policy that employees should use the bathroom that matches the gender on their photo ID.\xa0\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am considering changing the gender marker on my driver\'s license to a gender of X.\xa0 This means that if *$employer$* follows the policy above, I would technically be forbidden to use women\'s restrooms, despite ""looking female"".\xa0 But on top of that, it would also be difficult for me to use **any** bathroom: Out of the seven buildings on *$employer\'s$* main campus, I would only be allowed to use the bathroom in four buildings, and students with an X on their license would have only three bathrooms unless they got faculty/staff permission.  *$Further detail on existing bathrooms that I\'d be allowed to use, and about where my office/meetings are located.$*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Would it be possible for the union to (1) discuss this issue with the employer, or whomever it is that passed down this rule that we can only use the bathroom that matches the gender on our ID, **and**\xa0for the union to (2) get a verbal agreement from the managers that while this is being sorted out, no union members (or ideally, others as well) will be ""no-trespassed"" or otherwise punished for simply using a bathroom (regardless of the bathroom\'s gender and the person\'s ID)?\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What I would like to see long term, is a policy that does both of the following:\xa0\n\n1. Allows people to use whatever bathroom they want, regardless of their gender marker on their ID.\xa0 (I\'m not out as being nonbinary at work.\xa0 If this policy forced me to use only ungendered bathrooms, I would be put in the position of having to choose between violating the policy and risking being ""no-trespassed"", or following the policy and ""outing"" myself which could be unsafe for me.)\xa0\xa0\n2. Designates one third of bathrooms as being available to all genders (male, female, and nonbinary).\xa0 These all gender / gender neutral bathrooms can be either ""single seater"" or ""multi-seater"", so long as they are located at ADA-acceptable distances from all locations, and an ADA-acceptable proportion of them are accessible.\xa0\xa0\n\n&gt;This exclusionary bathroom policy at my place of employment is currently the biggest hurdle standing in the way of my correcting my gender on my driver\'s license.\xa0\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Again, I would prefer if you could keep my name private for the time being, but you can share this email with my name removed.\xa0\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for your time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely,\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\--*$My Name$*', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Model letter to union/employer about bathrooms for nonbinary folx', 'created': 1573789321.0}"

My pcp almost instantly submitted referrals for me for the surgeries I want, but then she told me that there was a 6 month wait to get a surgery letter from a provider there, and that I should look for an alternative place to get the two letters I need.  She told me to go to a clinic run by UCSF, but when I called them to make an appointment they wouldn't take me because I don't live in San Francisco. The other resources she gave me were all walk-in clinics that are only open during times that are really inconvenient for me, so I was having a hard time figuring out when I would even be able to initiate that process.  Finally I got a call from a scheduling coordinator at Lyon-Martin telling me one of their therapists could meet with me for an intake appointment, and I asked them if this therapist could write one of my surgery referral letters.  They told me no, they could not, and pointed me back in the direction of one of the inconveniently timed walk-in clinics.  I agreed to schedule the intake appointment anyway, because I could still use the therapy, but I ended up cancelling it due to a last minute conflict.  A week later, the therapist themself called me, and I asked them directly if they would be able to provide a gender surgery letter.  They said possibly!  I had the appointment today, and after briefly talking about my dysphoria and my goals for surgery, they scheduled me a surgery letter evaluation for next month, and said that if they determine me to be a good candidate for surgery they'll get me an appointment with a second therapist for my second letter.

Naturally, I'm so relieved to have the appointment made.  Progress feels so joyful and I'm so excited to be one step closer to feeling at home in my own body, but I'm incredibly angry about being downright lied to.  I understand they're overwhelmed with patients, every low-income trans clinic in the Bay Area is, but it seems ridiculous that they did everything they could to push me elsewhere when it turned out they were able to provide me with the service I needed the whole time.

How should I tell people? I’m a graphic designer so I was thinking about posting about it on my Instagram account with a nice graphic but would love to hear how others have done it.

(trigger warning just in case for explicit descriptions of dysphoric thoughts) 

as an unfortunately self-conscious and paranoid ace person i hate the idea of being potentially sexualized in any way. due to this though i can't tell if the reason i fantasize every day about cutting off my chest and getting rid of my curves is because i don't want to be sexualized or because of gender dysphoria. i've always felt they were unnecessary, but now i also feel they're alien, and i often stand before the mirror just comparing different shirts and seeing which ones de-emphasize my chest the most. i can't deal with dressing in anything considered traditionally feminine i.e. makeup, skirts, dresses, and i generally feel awkward when my female friends talk about these things. they wanted me to put on a face mask once before prom (where i did go in a dress but hated my chest so much that i actually attempted to stuff cloth underneath the bust to make it look flatter) and i'm completely aware that anyone of any gender can use these for personal hygiene reasons but i just couldn't join in because idk i guess face masks somehow conflicted with myself as a person...or maybe i just have internalized sexism. i don't know. 

however, i don't have dysphoria with my vagina, nor do i have problems with having long hair. when i need to go to the restroom i go into the women's restroom without much afterthought and i subconsciously fit myself into the ""woman"" category when i read things online talking about women as a whole. yet i hate being referred to as a woman myself, and feel awful when people use gendered terminology on me. i also have been having trouble for the past few months with regards to anything concerning gender. i spent too long thinking about whether or not i should write ""f"" on all papers, intentionally omitted giving out my pronouns whenever mass group introductions were done, and generally felt anxious acknowledging anything my gender. i also tend to play as the male character in video games possibly because i don't want to think about playing as ""myself,"" and recently while reading visual novels w/people at gatherings i've felt off about being auto-assigned to voice act the female character. also dunno if this is relevant but as a result of playing a male character in an mmorpg (as well as having a gender neutral username), people used he/him/his pronouns on me, which felt all right. actually in general all of the most common pronouns feel okay to me, even she/her/hers, although i reject being called a woman still...

For me, androgyny is my main goal with my gender presentation (if people see me as N/A instead of male or female, that's what I'd prefer most of the time). I have a tiny frame and a feminine face, so my efforts to either exist between the two binaries or sit outside of it typically doesn't work (in my perception at least). Most of my dysphoria comes from thinking that I come off as feminine too often.

It seems like low- or micro-dosing T is a popular opinion for nb people who want to minimize their feminine features/gain masculine ones/strike androgyny. I've considered this option heavily as I would be excited about the body and face masculinization. 

However, I don't have a problem with my voice and would actually prefer to preserve it. I was trained classically as a soprano and have a decently high range. I have a feeling that starting any amount of T would lower my voice, and I don't know if losing my high range would be worth abating my dysphoria.

I'd really like to hear from people who have micro-dosed T in order to assess how quickly/much my voice could drop if I were to start T.

for some background, i originally came out as ftm about 8 or 9 years ago, when i was between the ages of 12 and 14. i exclusively used he/him pronouns until i was about 17, when i then started using but he/him and they/them pronouns, realizing that i was nonbinary. around ages 19-20, i started exclusively using they/them pronouns, and i became a lot more comfortable presenting ""femininely."" i, personally, just feel comfortable wearing whatever, regardless ast o how people view me :) i am now 21, btw.

so for the past almost 10 years, i have gone by a different name than the one i was given at birth, and my birth name, for reference, is a traditionally feminine name. however, my state recently passed a change that allows people to put their gender on the license/ID as nonbinary, which is super awesome!

as a result of this, however, i've realized i've become a lot more comfortable with the name i was given at birth? because i have become increasingly more comfortable with the idea that a name is not inherently indicative of gender, and the name that i have been going by for the past 10ish years is traditionally Very masculine, and no longer fits me as the person i am today

2019-11-17 23:43:37,dxuqz7,0,1,"I’m not like other girls. It’s a cliche, overused phrase, but it holds true for me in particular. I have only met one other woman who had a beard, and it was not nearly as robust as mine. I inherited the body hair of my mother’s side of the family, so unless I am giving myself a daily wax there is no way to avoid looking like a werewolf. Thus, I am keeping my beard as an artistic expression of my nonbinary, trans self. 

Why should I have to change my body to be who I am? I used to beat myself up over not being the petite epitome of feminine - an I mean literally hitting myself because I’m an emotional roller coaster who hated myself. But, I have since learned to love who I am as I am. I am enough and I don’t need to radically change or even mutilate my body to express my innermost feminine feelings.

Of course, this sets me apart from society as a whole. Before I moved to Portland, I became the local spectacle in my hometown of Syracuse just for wearing a skirt. I feel a lot of healing has happened since moving to the west coast where I can reflect my identity in my choices much more freely without consequences. 

Still, I am odd. That’s a given, being that I am schizoaffective as well. It makes life a bizarre roller coaster in addition to dealing with my identity issues. I like to describe my condition as being bipolar but the aliens are abducting me to save me from the CIA which is trying desperately to create a reality TV show about my life. I am often in an eccentric self-generated narrative about what I am doing at any given moment. My purpose is always changing, as is how I am perceiving different events.

Naturally, you can expect that this adds a lot of pressure onto me for fitting in. And that’s the thing - I don’t. In a society that is so radically split into dichotomous us vs. them thinking, I proudly stand out against the even background. I am a dodecahedron in a world full of square and round holes. I don’t have many friends, but those I do have are true companions that I genuinely am grateful to have in my life.

I am homeless, but part of that is by choice. My entire experience spiralling onto the streets has been a radical transformative event, and I continue to seek authentic human experiences to expand my horizons. By regularly being forced outside my comfort zone, I have been actively reconditioned to be much freer than I once was. My perception of self has changed to the point where I don’t need any reassurance from other people to find solace with myself of my actions. I am as I am, and I am happy and grateful that I get to be me; an alien on my homeplanet.

Basically, what I’m trying to say is that you should believe in yourself and go confidently about your day. If I can survive in this world on the farthest fringe of the bell curve, then that is proof that it doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like. If I can find happiness in a world that has been designed for people that are in no way like me, then that is definitive proof that happiness is completely self-defined.

#  TODAY was the first day I was able to leave the house with my nails painted, I felt terrified and happy at the same time

my mother painted them and the nervousness begun by asking her to help me LOL and her answer was

""I find it a little strange a man with painted nails but if you want it then come here and I’ll help you""

(Daaaam I was happy hahaha)

(Who knows me knows I’m bisexual, but not everyone is aware of my non-binary status, just my closest friends)

The most confusing part for me is that I already draw a lot of attention 

I am 5'10 (around here this height is considered tall) 

my hair is a curly mane that I am very proud of 

and at the moment I wear beard and 3 pairs of hoop earrings

Considering the culture and religiousness from this whereabouts, it's a lot for the “regular folk” to take it in hahahaha

but even with all of this, painting my nails has always been something I struggled with

&amp;#x200B;

and then two things happened

1 - the uber drive, literally the first person who saw my hands, crooked his face... and i was sad at first, the only person that saw it gave me a terrible look like it was an ugly and damn thing. Even though i was kinda waiting for, it hurt a little.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - I arrived at my friends place, we were having this little late Halloween party, and then some responded with surprise and most loved it hahahaha  

I even forgot about the uber driver and I was so happy that I'm still silly about it

&amp;#x200B;

it's amazing to me that something apparently so small can mess with me so much and make me so happy

it was nervousness, sadness, happiness and then a feeling of acceptance that warmed me inside

and it was this community that helped me gather the courage for it today so THANK YOU ALL 

who shared your photos and stories here, it really helped me and I won't stop here

They/them pronouns make me so so happy, but I’m a very fact based person. I can’t find any scientific proof of being non-binary, so I try and bury my feelings. I try and tell myself that I’m faking it and I just want to be special. But no matter how hard I try it doesn’t go away.\n\n I generally don’t care about the opinions of others, but every time I see someone saying non-binary people are disgusting, attention seeking, faking it, idiotic, it hurts. It makes me want to crawl into a hole in hide and I don’t know what to do. \n\nIt’d make me so happy to come out, buy a chest binder, start going by the name that I want (it’s ezra), and have people use they/them pronouns for me, \n\nBut I’m so so so insecure and scared and I’m still in high school and kids are mean', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'confused and help is welcome', 'created': 1574071749.0}"

TLDR at the bottom. 

Here's some background. I've been identifing as a trans guy for a long time now but when I was first trying to figure out my gender and expression, I identified as genderfluid. Not too long later, I just got the idea of having to be binary and really did connect with being FtM (and still do). I've always been open to using he/him/they pronouns and definitely do. A while ago I asked a trans support blog if someone could be ftm and non-binary which they informed me you definitely can! That made me feel so vaild because sometimes I don't feel necessarily just a ""man"" if anything, I like to see myself as just me. Okay, but here's the actual thing I'm trying to say, most of my friends and things see me as a guy and are very nice, especially one who basically came out as trans soon after I did. I've been trying to think of a way to say I'm an enby (trans?) guy without being scared of maybe people thinking I'm not ""trans enough"" or ""guy"" enough or just assuming because I am this way, maybe they'll see differently of me or even the idea of being ""too supportive"" forcing themselves to use they/them on me and quit using he/him all together. Sometimes I casually bring up being okay with more neutral gendering things but that seems to confuse people, either not knowing what to say or thinking it's because I'm just not 100% passing, that it's a social thing. Another really big concern if mine is I'm only in the closet to my immediate family and when my girlfriend stayed with me I told her to please use they/them around my sister and basically she said that she couldn't do that without even giving it a second thought about trying. That low-key broke my heart because I think if I tell her she won't understand and if she does accept it I don't think she'll keep that in mind at all.

Does anyone have experience with coming out as NB after identifying with a binary gender for such a long time? How was it? How did you go about explaining it to people you know or even strangers? Do you just let people think you're binary? Help. :(

Sorry for rambling. I know it's probably confusing.

I\'ve been identifing as a trans guy for a long time now but when I was first trying to figure out my gender and expression, I identified as genderfluid. Not too long later, I just got the idea of having to be binary and really did connect with being FtM (and still do). I\'ve always been open to using he/him/they pronouns and definitely do. A while ago I asked a trans support blog if someone could be ftm and non-binary which they informed me you definitely can! That made me feel so vaild because sometimes I don\'t feel necessarily just a ""man"" if anything, I like to see myself as just me. Okay, but here\'s the actual thing I\'m trying to say, most of my friends and things see me as a guy and are very nice, especially one who basically came out as trans soon after I did.

2019-11-18 17:21:41,dy66zd,2,1,"Hi
Some months ago, I started to play a DnD 5ed short campaing and I need to create a character. So when I begin to think how he/she/they would be, I thought ""Why not a non binary character?"" It must perfectly valid to play it. And would be a nice way to put some representation on the game (and as I far I know, nearly all on the table never meet a trans person, so it could be educative)

So, I made they as a wood elf druid, oriented to use wild shaped to adopt different animal forms. I always describe they as a very androgynous look, being hard to read they as female or male. But, I try to make a bit more masculine or feminine every few days.
When they take the form of an animal, they switch the visible sexual organs so not always are the same (a good thing of a fantasy RPG is that I can do it! )

The background lore it's that they born and live a lot of time with wood elf tribes in the deep of the forest, and later enter on a druid circle. As his people have a deep know of the nature, they know that his gender is totally natural and always treat they with respect. So they hadn't live any kind of oppression or discrimination for being non binary. They like to take animal shaped very often, as it allow to switch his gender expression on a deeper way that they could do on his elf shape.

I really like playing they. I find the druid class funny to play and I think that his usage of wild shape, it's what any trans druid character would like to do.

I played they four sessions (one one-shot, and 3 on the main campaign) and they is working very fine on the group. On the first session, the other players had some confusion with they (I never declared the gender of they, and I keep changing between femenine and masculine when I talk about they), but besides of some little on rol joke, it's going very well. Even, on the last session, someone had the thought that they is trans.

I like to ask as a cis male, what I could do to play they better. I'm doing something bad with the way that I'm trying to represent a non binary character on game ? I'm worried about if I could being falling on some stereotype...

2019-11-18 20:06:57,dy8lnq,0,1,"Hello there!
I tried searching for an answer, but couldn't find anything, so apologies if there was a similar thread.

Don't want to bore you with the story of my life, but basically I'm an afab non-binary. My brain is pretty much androgynous, but I kinda identify with both genders (sometimes more with female, sometimes more with male, but it's never 100%) and - the most frustrating thing ever - can experience dysphoria directed towards both feminine and masculine attributes of my body. It depends.

I tried to live as a male. I tried to live as a female. And I just can't stick to one, though my social dysphoria gets better when I'm treated as a guy (or in a gender neutral way). Sooner or later I feel the need to switch.

And here's the thing: switching means either going on T or going off T. I've done that a few times over the years (the longest I've been on T was 1.5 years, then I took a ~2 year break, sometimes I would go on T once or twice a year for a few months). It's the only way I can feel comfortable in my body - having this choice. But I'm worried it might be unhealthy and potentially dangerous. I don't want to mess up my body. I'm afraid it might be the reason why my hair falls out sometimes (like right now. It's really scary). I'm gonna visit an endocrinologist soon, but so far everything was fine, nothing outside the norm, both when I let my body produce natural hormones and when I take shots.

Also, I always wait at least a couple of months to half a year before I switch, so I try to be as regular as possible and never make those decisions randomly out of blue without giving myself plenty of time to think about it. But I can't help getting worried anyway.

However this is not the first time I have heard this idea which I always found very odd, also I can\'t help but think the information on the sidebar of this sub inadvertently supports this idea because for related communities the first suggestion is r/ftm but r/mtf is not mentioned.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Where does the idea that all NB people are AFAB come from?

2019-11-19 03:43:23,dyexpi,4,1,"TLDR: Very very new to this community and only came out to myself a few months ago. I came out to my wife of 2 years Saturday, and she was very understanding and supportive, but also understandably confused and anxious. For those of you who have been in similar situations, how did you build reassurance and expand understanding with your spouse and use your newfound understanding of gender to further strengthen your relationship? Are there any subthreads or resources I can refer her to? Everytime she searches on her own, she ends up at gendercritical and it takes her a few minutes to realize they're not there to help us.

And now for the longer version: 

I'm 33 AMAB, been married a little over two years now, and I've struggled with my gender my entire life - but I never really was able to wrap my head around what I felt or what I was. As a practicing Christian from a more conservative religious upbringing in the South, there was a lot of shame early on, wanting to be more feminine and wishing I could be both a girl and a boy. I'd wonder if I was gay, or later if I was trans, and then assure myself I was a cis straight male because that's how God made me. I'd buy cute feminine clothes and then later purge my closet, repeatedly.

A few months ago though, I was listening to a podcast, I don't remember which one, and they were discussing the terms nonbinary in depth - and all of a sudden everything finally made sense! It's probably the only time I've ever really felt gender euphoria, and it was great. However, I still didn't feel comfortable being out in public or even with people I'm close with. I've always presented as hyper masculine - a nice thick beard, a 300lb+ bench, football, wrestling, lacrosse - you get the picture. I'm afraid the contrast would be too much for most people in my life to handle. 

My wife however, is a wonderful, loving person who shares my faith, but comes from a much more progressive West Coast background. She doesn't identify as bisexual, but she freely admits she has some bisexual tendencies, which I've been totally cool with. This weekend, I finally decided to come out to her as a nonbinary bigender person, just hoping the whole time that she really was the loving understanding person I fell in love with. 

And she is. Y'all she was so great! The first thing she did was take me to her closet to see if I liked/could fit in any of her clothes and asked if I wanted to wear any of her jewelry, then the next day we went and got our nails done together! I only did my toes though (neon purple!) because definitely still uncomfortable being out in public. But it was such a great experience. I just want to make life as easy and encouraging for her as she goes through this journey with me as she's already made it for me, and I'd love any advice or input.

For those of you who have been in similar situations, how did you build reassurance and expand understanding with your spouse and use your newfound understanding of gender to further strengthen your relationship? Are there any subthreads or resources I can refer her to? Everytime she searches on her own, she ends up at gendercritical and it takes her a few minutes to realize they're not there to help us.\n\nAnd now for the longer version: \n\nI'm 33 AMAB, been married a little over two years now, and I've struggled with my gender my entire life - but I never really was able to wrap my head around what I felt or what I was. As a practicing Christian from a more conservative religious upbringing in the South, there was a lot of shame early on, wanting to be more feminine and wishing I could be both a girl and a boy. I'd wonder if I was gay, or later if I was trans, and then assure myself I was a cis straight male because that's how God made me. I'd buy cute feminine clothes and then later purge my closet, repeatedly.\n\nA few months ago though, I was listening to a podcast, I don't remember which one, and they were discussing the terms nonbinary in depth - and all of a sudden everything finally made sense! It's probably the only time I've ever really felt gender euphoria, and it was great. However, I still didn't feel comfortable being out in public or even with people I'm close with. I've always presented as hyper masculine - a nice thick beard, a 300lb+ bench, football, wrestling, lacrosse - you get the picture. I'm afraid the contrast would be too much for most people in my life to handle. \n\nMy wife however, is a wonderful, loving person who shares my faith, but comes from a much more progressive West Coast background. She doesn't identify as bisexual, but she freely admits she has some bisexual tendencies, which I've been totally cool with. This weekend, I finally decided to come out to her as a nonbinary bigender person, just hoping the whole time that she really was the loving understanding person I fell in love with. \n\nAnd she is. Y'all she was so great! The first thing she did was take me to her closet to see if I liked/could fit in any of her clothes and asked if I wanted to wear any of her jewelry, then the next day we went and got our nails done together! I only did my toes though (neon purple!) because definitely still uncomfortable being out in public. But it was such a great experience. I just want to make life as easy and encouraging for her as she goes through this journey with me as she's already made it for me, and I'd love any advice or input.\n\nSorry for the novella, I can be pretty wordy sometimes. But thanks for listening if you made it this far, and for any advice you can share."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Just Came Out to My Wife', 'created': 1574160203.0}"

2019-11-20 09:13:09,dyzkpq,3,1,"New to the sub, not new to being trans/nb. Been out since 2015. I just really need to braindump this somewhere where folks will at least have some idea of what I'm dealing with. My therapist of 5 years passed away on November 3rd so I haven't had a space to really talk about these things. I'm specifically looking for support in the form of sympathy/empathy and positive encouragement. I know some of the things below are not healthy and suuuuuper internalized transphobia (hence the title); that's why I'm looking for a new therapist. :) My internalized transphobia is not a commentary on anyone else but myself.

I identify as nonbinary/agender (they/them). I'm decently vocal about it. I post a lot about using proper pronouns on fb and my friends have been getting a lot better at using the correct ones. I've worked for LGBTQ nonprofits for the last three years where I've been gendered correctly, and now I have business cards with my pronouns on them! It's very exciting. I'm really bad at correcting people when misgendering happens but that's on me.

But I'm feeling really distant from myself. I don't take pictures or selfies anymore. I kind of actively avoid cameras because I don't like what I look like. I hate all of my clothes yet don't know what I would wear if I could go buy new clothes. I've lost 20lbs and the scariest thing for me is to show off my body anywhere but the gym. I think my trans body - 4yrs on T, almost 3yrs post-top surgery - is revolting and not something that should be considered attractive. The way I look/present right now is incompatible with how I see myself.

I haven't always seen myself this way. I used to love taking pictures and selfies. It's actually since I started going to the gym that these feelings have really manifested. I guess I thought if I got in shape that I would feel better about my body (I've also got general body dysphoria - thanks, mom), but that has not been the case. I want to show off my hard work, yet I fear doing so will emphasize my transness. My gym is super supportive - we actually have a women &amp; nb only weightlifting class - but I still feel like a freak in how people perceive me as masculine due to my facial hair and how I wear women's yoga pants to exercise. 

And this drills down to the bigger problem at hand. I want to dress more femininely and feel cute again, but I'm terrified. Weirdly, I am less scared of potential violence than I am of being seen as ugly or a freak. Outside of work, I hang out in primarily cishet spaces and my friends are incidentally queer, as in, we're friends due to our interests and we both happen to be queer. (I used to hang out in a few trans only/majority spaces, but have since stopped due to time, interest, and drama.) Like I mentioned earlier, my cis friends are hella supportive and complimentary in whatever I wear or present. Even when they are being their most supportive, if I'm not wearing something masculine/androgynous (read: jeans + t-shirt), I feel like a freak. I love wearing dresses. They are so goddamn fun. I feel cute when I wear dresses. But when other people are suddenly factored in, I want to hide.

When it comes to dating/relationships, I've essentially shut off that part of me. I used to have crushes all the time. Now, there's no one I'm interested in. I think a bit of that has to do with the spaces I frequent, though there are plenty of queers in those spaces too. But I think I've so internalized my transphobia and my disgust toward my own body that I figure no one will want me, so what's the point?

The ironic thing to all of this, is that I've been hooking up with a girl from my gym for the last month. She came over last week and we had sex - the first time since I started transitioning in 2015. She was very patient and kind; I literally could not have picked a better person to go on this journey with me. It was easy for me to do things for her, but when she wanted to do things for me, I couldn't. I declined for a few reasons: inexperience (I can count my good sexual experiences on one hand), fear that I wouldn't like it, and most of all, confusion as to why she would want to do that. Why is she attracted to someone who looks like me, who has the body I do? And look, I'm really of two minds here. I have all this internalized transphobia and body dysphoria on the one hand, but on the other I know I am actually attractive (I was a child model, after all!). So I get what she's looking at and liking, but I truly don't understand why or why she'd want to have sex with me when she could easily find someone whose body makes sense. I know it's not up to me to determine how other people view me and that people can choose to see me however they want, positively and negatively. I'm still limiting myself because I have a certain image I want to uphold.

Also, the only people who seem to flirt with me are married/coupled cis women. I don't know what it is, but I have at least 4 who flirt with me and nothing can come of it.

I'm also in comedy, and I've been limiting myself in regards to that, too. I had my comedic voice all figured out pre-transition because it was really easy for me to be that woman who my father called a ""ball-buster"". Now that I appear male, I can't necessarily do that because I just look like a mean man, even when that's not who I am at all. I have 25yrs of identifying as a woman that informs my comedy! I did my time! So I just don't know what to do artistically. I still can't find my voice. 

And this is a totally separate aside, but I also hate writing scripts about the trans experience which isn't good since that's all anyone wants to hire me for. I have very little interest in writing trans narratives or specifically trans stories. Seeing as being a diversity hire might be my only ticket into a writer's room, I may have to become the trans comedy writer, instead of a talented comedy writer.

I want to love and celebrate my body in what it looks like and what it can do, but I'm currently trapped in a tornado of internalized transphobia, body dysphoria, and gender dysphoria. I want to get out but seeing as I'm nearly 30, I've lived with these issues for a long time and have tried lots of things that have not worked.

almost all of my irl friends are nonbinary or at least some other kind of trans, and i've been out to the group at large for almost a year now. however i'm the only amab person in the group, and sometimes that gets me in a spot of bother when gender is being discussed. 

one very close friend in particular i've had to all but stop talking to entirely for fear of being, ostensibly entirely unintentionally, made to feel super dysphoric and shitty. they're a nonbinary butch lesbian, and base all of their theoretical approaches to gender and gender politics on this abstract construct of ""womanhood,"" regularly presenting gender trauma and any conflicting or complex experience of gender to be something tied innately to being afab and/or a woman. they've even gone so far as to straight up say that any trauma due to being an amab nonbinary person is irrelevant except in relation to that of afab people and trans women.

of course, this is someone i know would never hurt me on purpose, and i'm sure if i went to them and brought it up we could eventually work out this specific problem, i've just been having a rough mental health time overall recently (its all  temporary and thus manageable dw) so i haven't wanted to expose myself to any more potential dysphoria until i'm in a slightly stabler place mentally. but the issue is not an isolated one, almost all of my friends have made me uncomfortable in some way or another when discussing gender (still workin on actually mentioning it when it happens, i'm a work in progress lol), and often when folks talk about trans people it seems what they actually mean is just afab trans people and trans women. i know *intellectually* that i as an amab person am just as trans as anyone else, and that my dysphoria and gender related trauma are perfectly valid, but fuck is it tough sometimes to bear that in mind and really internalize it when it seems to be something that even my closest and most trusted friends in the trans community disbelieve in on some level, or at the very least rarely remember.

**Tl;dr:**
I’m a confused trans masc enby trying to overcome the guilt I feel coming out to my parents. I feel like I’ve disappointed them by “being a trender” even though I *know* that’s my internalized fear and that they will support me unconditionally. My mom asks questions, though, and I balked the last two times I tried to talk to them about it. 

I told my parents last week that I started T “recently,” and I feel so bad about it that I want to stop entirely. I maybe didn’t come out as nonbinary very well, a couple months ago I said I was exploring my gender and my mom responded by saying not to get too hung up on labels. I just barely have a visible hint of a mustache, I’m really happy with where my voice is, and my leg hair and eyebrows have darkened nicely. 

I have been exploring my gender for a couple of years now. I went by Harry at Dunkin’ for almost a year, and have been using Eliot since before spring break. I’m out as Eliot to the local queer community and recently came out to some select family members, including my brother in law.

When I think about my transition so far, I am really happy. I’m excited to start having facial hair and to be involved with a social community that uses and respects my chosen name and pronouns. I kind of want to move job locations so that I can meet people as myself instead of having to come out and correct people or continue to be closeted and hide my transition from work. But when I think about my parents, I want to detransition completely. I want to wax my lip and throw out my T and buy new bras and apologize for being confused and hurting people with my mistake. 

My parents are very hip to non-binary genders and have always been LGBTQ+ allies, but I feel like my mom has always thought that I’m just trying to fit in with the community. I have a lot of gender-expansive friends now, I’m active in the local queer community, so maybe I just like feeling special and like I belong?

I guess I’m facing internalized stigma against nonbinary people and projecting that onto others, because I feel like I would have an easier time coming out to my parents as a trans man. But how do I explain that I want to transition to look more masculine so that I’m more comfortable presenting a little more feminine? 

She asked why I wanted to be on T and I couldn’t really explain it. I want to be mostly read as a “guy...?” when wearing pastels and nail polish. I want to wear just board shorts at the beach, and to look cute in EGL dresses. I want to be a gender chameleon, not tied down to one gender/presentation, and I feel like I couldn’t be that when I look butch or like a girly cis girl. I’m more of a femboy or “tomgirl” at heart, and I want to represent the part of me that always wished that I was born a boy so that I could play with dolls and wear dresses and subvert gender norms the way my brain has always wanted to. 

Typing this all out has reassured me that I really am legitimately some kind of trans person, and that I wish we had more non-toxic male icons in western culture. Also, it’s really hard for me to separate “I have a crush on this boy” from “I want to look like this boy.” But I’m getting there.

Until I started doing massage. I’ve been touched, asked to pick dick spots, grunted at sexually, boners galore, been physically hit after telling someone to keep their pants on... it just doesn’t make me feel safe. So I stopped doing massage except for ladies. It’s my own home and my own hands and a massage therapist is able to set rules about who they touch. Just like anyone in any scenario. You have the right to say no. 

However, before I did massage I wanted to be inclusive of everyone. I made clear treatment lists. It was listed by treatment not by men’s/women’s. Anyone could have a back wax if they wanted. Cismen come for other treatments and I feel totally safe. They are great people. Never push my boundaries. But as soon as massage is involved, the clientele that comes in takes a dark turn and are scary. The men that have other treatments have never booked massages and they are genuine, honest people that I’d be more than happy to do so. 

But how can I be inclusive when I get crude emails from cismen and transwomen. I have always stood up for everyone’s right to be and love who they want to be, on a personal level. But awful individuals always seem to use this as a way to assault me in my business. Eg ‘hello I am a trans woman and I want to come for a massage’ but with a crude email address or website or phone number that would lead me to believe that actually this is just someone with a creepy fetish of writing to salons in a vulgar way (come across it before in sales jobs, people just call to get off, very weird). 

Would you please share your experiences of salons with me? Is there anywhere that wowed you? Is there anything that would make you feel safer? 

As I know there are so many horror stories about ‘trans person goes to beauty salon, is turned away.’ The only time I would need to turn someone away is bikini waxing is very different on different genitals (I know genitals don’t matter it’s what is inside that counts, but they do if you don’t want to be bruised and have skin ripped off because the therapist isn’t trained in stretching correctly the area they are waxing). But because of my experiences with cismen, there is no way I want to train in ‘men’s intimate waxing.’ I can’t open my home to even more trouble. I am at my wits end. Constant panic attacks. 

I suppose what I’m trying to say is....is there a way I can be inclusive except to creepy old men 😆 because I think everyone should be able to come for a leg wax, pedicure, manicure, brow tidy, etc without feeling like they have to follow a men’s/women’s menu. 

If this was just a select few individuals I’ve had this problem with it wouldn’t bother me but because it is every single time a man is here for a massage, it is very very confusing and worrying. I don’t want to be sued for not being inclusive. But I also accept that I need to be educated on the proper way to do things.

2019-11-21 20:05:47,dzp0n6,13,1,"Hi y'all. Just a throwaway account since the people I'm about to talk about know my main! 

I'm a 24 year old bi/pan Asian NB (they/them) and I've been relatively closeted my whole life, only a few close friends know I'm nonbinary or queer, most of my family sees me as a stereotypical straight male. I recently had an experience that made me really uncomfortable and still has me constantly examining my own perception of self, my own gender identity, because of how thoroughly it rattled me. I wanted to ask y'all for some perspective, maybe some advice, or to see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

A few weeks ago, I went to go visit my friend (22 NB lesbian) in their city, where they go to school. Earlier in the year, say, March/April, we had hooked up when I visited them then, and we hit it off really well, lot of flirting, chemistry, shared interests, etc. It wasn't long before I found myself catching feelings, and we sort of danced around the issue for a few more months; we had a couple of visits to each other's cities, going on sort-of dates, just in general being affectionate and intimate when possible. In August, I asked them over Discord if they were interested in dating, as we had been moving around the issue a fair bit - they had some residual relationship issues internally they wanted to settle before committing to an actual relationship, while I personally knew I had issues with my own past trauma regarding relationships, this had all been discussed on and off - but I had felt it was OK to move forwards with this. They expressed a bit of hesitation but said they were open to giving it a try, and I tabled the issue 'til I could see them IRL again, as I felt making decisions like committing to a relationship were best served for in-person, face to face conversation.

This time around, things were a little more tense. A combination of school stress - one of the main reasons I wasn't super gung-ho about chasing/pressing the issue was their massive academic load - and just general personal issues had them being more shy, less eager to be kissed and to be affectionate. Even so, I persevered (with consent), trying to make them feel at ease and comfortable as best as I could - something I would do for any of my friends feeling stressed and out of sorts. On the second day, I brought up the concept of exclusivity, asking if we were an item and if so, would they like to be monogamous? They seemed surprised at the question and turned it around, asking me if I wanted that. I replied in the affirmative and they said that they weren't seeing anyone else at the moment, to which I added (feeling like the moment was slipping away) that they could, if they wanted to. They replied that they might, in a very quiet tone of voice, and I was kinda hurt but I understood, y'know? Open relationships are a thing. If they weren't ready for a commitment, that's alright. 

A bit later, we had another conversation, where they admitted they didn't feel like they were in a place to actually date anyone, between academic work and just life stuff, they couldn't see themselves in a relationship. Some of the things that came up in the discussion were the concepts of anxious/avoidant relationship types, things like that, and just a general mutual consensus that, yes, we still enjoyed each other's company and we still liked each other and were attracted to each other, so I said, ""Guess we're just FWB then?"" And they nodded and held my hand, so I felt the issue was pretty settled. They did also say that I was being a little too forward when kissing them, so I made a mental note to chill on that front.

OK, wrapping things up, promise, the title part comes in here because I was really hurt at this point. Near the end of my visit, we were cuddling in bed and I started to make a move, just being affectionate in general - we had had a really lovely time out and I felt a good way to end our visit was with some intimacy. We fooled around for a bit, but after a while they said they weren't really feeling it. We got into another talk - they apologized deeply and said that they were attracted to women, and when I asked if they were attracted to me, they said they weren't sure. The conversation waxed and waned but the crux of it was that they respected my identity as a NB individual but felt that my body was too conventionally masculine/male for them to be attracted to - they added on that (I felt this was kinda hurtful but I see where they were coming from) if I were a female, they'd likely be a lot more receptive/respond more to my affection. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post - I wanted to provide as much context as possible for the story to show both sides as best as possible, just to cover as much as possible. I want to also add that I know people are allowed to be attracted to whatever they want to be, and that's on them, but it genuinely felt like, hurtful and transphobic? In a way, it felt like I was being reduced to my body and genitals - I present male for my work environment and family because I'm not out yet, and being told that, in some roundabout way, I wasn't feminine enough for them really cut me deeply. I'm still wrestling with the issues that bubbled up because of this. They're not a bad person, and we're still friends, but I'm just still really hurt. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading! Stay fresh my nonbinary pals.

Just a throwaway account since the people I\'m about to talk about know my main! \n\nI\'m a 24 year old bi/pan Asian NB (they/them) and I\'ve been relatively closeted my whole life, only a few close friends know I\'m nonbinary or queer, most of my family sees me as a stereotypical straight male. I recently had an experience that made me really uncomfortable and still has me constantly examining my own perception of self, my own gender identity, because of how thoroughly it rattled me. I wanted to ask y\'all for some perspective, maybe some advice, or to see if anyone else has experienced something similar.\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to go visit my friend (22 NB lesbian) in their city, where they go to school. Earlier in the year, say, March/April, we had hooked up when I visited them then, and we hit it off really well, lot of flirting, chemistry, shared interests, etc. It wasn\'t long before I found myself catching feelings, and we sort of danced around the issue for a few more months; we had a couple of visits to each other\'s cities, going on sort-of dates, just in general being affectionate and intimate when possible. In August, I asked them over Discord if they were interested in dating, as we had been moving around the issue a fair bit - they had some residual relationship issues internally they wanted to settle before committing to an actual relationship, while I personally knew I had issues with my own past trauma regarding relationships, this had all been discussed on and off - but I had felt it was OK to move forwards with this. They expressed a bit of hesitation but said they were open to giving it a try, and I tabled the issue \'til I could see them IRL again, as I felt making decisions like committing to a relationship were best served for in-person, face to face conversation.\n\nThis time around, things were a little more tense. A combination of school stress - one of the main reasons I wasn\'t super gung-ho about chasing/pressing the issue was their massive academic load - and just general personal issues had them being more shy, less eager to be kissed and to be affectionate. Even so, I persevered (with consent), trying to make them feel at ease and comfortable as best as I could - something I would do for any of my friends feeling stressed and out of sorts. On the second day, I brought up the concept of exclusivity, asking if we were an item and if so, would they like to be monogamous? They seemed surprised at the question and turned it around, asking me if I wanted that. I replied in the affirmative and they said that they weren\'t seeing anyone else at the moment, to which I added (feeling like the moment was slipping away) that they could, if they wanted to. They replied that they might, in a very quiet tone of voice, and I was kinda hurt but I understood, y\'know? Open relationships are a thing. If they weren\'t ready for a commitment, that\'s alright. \n\nA bit later, we had another conversation, where they admitted they didn\'t feel like they were in a place to actually date anyone, between academic work and just life stuff, they couldn\'t see themselves in a relationship. Some of the things that came up in the discussion were the concepts of anxious/avoidant relationship types, things like that, and just a general mutual consensus that, yes, we still enjoyed each other\'s company and we still liked each other and were attracted to each other, so I said, ""Guess we\'re just FWB then?"" And they nodded and held my hand, so I felt the issue was pretty settled. They did also say that I was being a little too forward when kissing them, so I made a mental note to chill on that front.\n\nOK, wrapping things up, promise, the title part comes in here because I was really hurt at this point. Near the end of my visit, we were cuddling in bed and I started to make a move, just being affectionate in general - we had had a really lovely time out and I felt a good way to end our visit was with some intimacy. We fooled around for a bit, but after a while they said they weren\'t really feeling it. We got into another talk - they apologized deeply and said that they were attracted to women, and when I asked if they were attracted to me, they said they weren\'t sure. The conversation waxed and waned but the crux of it was that they respected my identity as a NB individual but felt that my body was too conventionally masculine/male for them to be attracted to - they added on that (I felt this was kinda hurtful but I see where they were coming from) if I were a female, they\'d likely be a lot more receptive/respond more to my affection. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the long post - I wanted to provide as much context as possible for the story to show both sides as best as possible, just to cover as much as possible.

I told the co worker who relayed this information to me that if those people say anything again to her about to have them come talk directly to me so I can put a stop to this before something that isn’t even true possibly gets me in trouble.

I've been out as genderqueer for over a decade since I finally found a word for the kind of gnc I've been l o u d l y since I was a toddler. My mom just hasn't, uh, listened? She didn't know what it meant, so her brain never absorbed it. Honestly I don't tell her much, because she's exhausting. When I was coming out as queer in my early teens, she was BAD about that. She got better pretty quickly but never apologized.

My dad was okay. We were a lot alike and used to talk about everything. He died ten years ago. I'm not over it. I'm screwed up about it all the time. Whatever. 

So recently I changed my pronouns. I didn't change anything else. There is literally nothing new going on, just making other people actually respect my shit for once. And she's been a DISASTER. Just an endless selfish ignorant pain in my ass. Fine. She's always like that when she experiences even the slightest difficulty or confusion, hence why she's the last to know about the pronouns, which she's also mad about it. Whatever, I was SO calm and educational and careful with her, strung out response texts over a couple days to give her time to adjust every time, and she just kept ramping up the bullshit.

ANYWAY so she said an unforgivable thing, and it reminded me of a movie or book. There's a work of fiction in which someone's parent (or possibly a different familial relationship but I don't think so) pulls EXACTLY this nonsense, and I need help remembering where it's from because 1) it's gonna drive me nuts and 2) I wanna passive-aggressively remind her of it or recommend it to her so she has to see what she looks like.

I absolutely hate introducing myself with my pronouns. I fucking hate that I have to out myself just by telling people my pronouns, I hate that it makes me feel different and people might think it's weird, I hate having to educate people about my identity (I use they/them pronouns). If I'm in a very LGBTQ+ oriented space, it's not so bad, because I know I don't have to educate anyone, but just out in the regular public? It's awful.

I look pretty androgynous and people regularly throw he or she at me depending on... Whatever they feel like, I guess. I'm sure some people look at me and assume I'm binary trans, some see my birth gender, and some think I'm cis but the other binary gender.

I don't want to cause anyone distress.

I’ve continued to expand my wardrobe with more cute outfits, and it’s all got me feeling very validated and happy, even if I still question myself a lot and look for new and different ways to figure out how best to express my identity.  But, onto the good things...I wrote a note and posted it at my work thanking everyone for being so positive towards my changes, which received a lot of love.  

Then, a co-worker of mine approached me and told me that he read my letter and cried, because he is gender fluid, but are in a very non-supportive home, and told me I inspired him to start coming out.  Since then, he’s gotten a new name tag with his preferred name, came out some people, and I along with some (unfortunately not all, but a good portion) of our co-workers have been helping to affirm him as a first step in his identity.

I guess the point of this rant is, I know all too well how hard it is to put oneself out there in this way, and I never would have imagined how much I could help others just by being myself, and it makes me happy and excited to keep exploring myself going forward, knowing that other people in our community are becoming braver and happier seeing someone similar in our tiny, regressive town.

I'm biologically female but I dont feel like I identify with one or the other. I'm pretty certain I'm under the non-binary umbrella somewhere and I'm just looking for some opinions. I've never liked terms that are female. Girl, woman etc. The word woman especially makes me extremely uncomfortable. I also dont like masculine terms either like boy or man.

2019-11-23 18:14:30,e0ln00,7,1,"TL;DR-I realized I’m not a binary trans man, struggling to find an identity that describes that I feel on the masculine side of the gender spectrum. Suggestions? I’m interested to know how people picked their labels.

AFAB, 28 here. I’ve been identifying as a binary trans dude since I started HRT in March. Lately I just felt like trying to pass as a cis dude was draining all of my energy and making me feel not like myself. I tend to be happiest when I’m nonconforming/femme in my presentation. I think it’s confusing because my dysphoria is very much a binary sex thing-I’m not happy with any part of my female anatomy. I don’t even want nipples because they remind me of reproduction and all that jazz. My physical transition goals are very geared towards having a male body (facial hair is looking great)! It’s hard to remember that sex and gender are different things, which is why I’ve been confused. 

Now I’m trying to figure out a good label for myself. I feel masculine side of neutral. I’m happy I was raised socialized as a girl. I feel so much more connected to my emotions, I don’t contribute to a culture of toxic masculinity. It’s pretty cool. I understand what women/trans fem people go through. I feel like defining myself as a binary trans “man” would be giving up that part of myself. 

I don’t think genderfluid is a good way to describe it because I don’t think my internal feelings about my gender identity shift from day to day. Maybe genderqueer is a good way of putting it. Transmasc feels like it conflates sex and gender identity. Just saying I’m non-binary to me doesn’t describe that I’m on the masculine side of the spectrum. What are y’all’s thoughts?

Lately I just felt like trying to pass as a cis dude was draining all of my energy and making me feel not like myself. I tend to be happiest when I’m nonconforming/femme in my presentation. I think it’s confusing because my dysphoria is very much a binary sex thing-I’m not happy with any part of my female anatomy. I don’t even want nipples because they remind me of reproduction and all that jazz. My physical transition goals are very geared towards having a male body (facial hair is looking great)!

I had the thought that if ""they"" stand for two different things, 

- person who's gender is unknown or not relevant
- person who's gender is known to be nonbinary

there's a problem of mix ups when either people get offended because they assume they are thought to be nonbinary, or that nonbinary is seen less as a gender and somehow less permanent (yet to be decided; unknown) than he or she.

The more ""they"" comes to be cemented as *the* pronoun for nonbinary people, I was thinking that maybe there should be a new word for ""gender unknown for now or not relevant"". Like shey/shem?

I’m so tired. 

Where I am now, I’m getting happy with myself. I recognize myself. I’m learning to know and love myself. 

But I wish other people would learn to know me, too. 

My name is Malcolm Rowan (last name). I am 16 years old. A junior in high school. I enjoy reading, riding my bike and people watching. My favorite band is Glass Animals. My favorite movie is Grease. My favorite show is Jojo’s bizarre adventure. 

I am a nonbinary person. I prefer they/he pronouns. I’ve known since middle school. 

When I was younger, I could only see myself as disgusting and unlovable. I refused to look in the mirror or have pictures taken of me. I wore the same flannel for a year straight. I hated myself. I really, truly, in every sense of the word, hated myself. 

I thought I was fat, I tried to starve myself because I was so desperate to look different from the way I did. 

I know now that I was just uncomfortable with my chest and thighs, not my weight. 

Things got so bad I began to consider suicide. Luckily, I never got to the point I felt the need to actually do it, and I never will. 

That was years ago, things have changed for the better. The person I am now is someone younger me would’ve never dreamed of being.

They were all supportive and asked for my preferred pronouns and I told them I prefer they/them but it might change.  Later, one of them asked me how to use the pronoun they in the singular context.

I thought this was actually a really good question that made me question everything I thought I knew.  In this situation, ‘they’ replaces the binary he and she however because it is a singular ‘they’, is the verb following it ‘is’ or ‘are’?

It feels silly typing it now, but it took me a year to realize I identify as nonbinary.

it made me question myself because dating's been pretty shit and it made me wonder if guys just think i'm not feminine enough or something, and made me think about my more masculine tendencies and that maybe they mean something. also made me question why i don't have many close female friends. i have a couple female friends who are also kinda like me--female, creative, say 'dude' a lot, like sports, but straight. but i dress well and found a style that fits me, and my makeup is very light/natural but i enjoy wearing it (bb cream, lip balm, blush) and i definitely don't feel attracted to girls.",NonBinary,am i non binary?,1574779525.0,"{'created_utc': 1574754325, 'id': 'e1uqf2', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""hey y'all. i'm 24f and lately i've been questioning if i'm non binary. the thing is i've always been kind of 'tomboyish'. i remember when i was 5, my mom forced me to wear a dress that my grandparents gifted me and i HATED it. i hated all the dresses my grandparents got me. i actually have no idea why; i just had a strong repulsion against them. i was a flower girl for a wedding when i was 6 and i was literally traumatized because i freaking hated that dress, and ESPECIALLY the lipstick they forced me to wear. when i was in elementary school, i liked picking out clothes that were minimal and not too pink/girly. i've always had slightly more male interests like sports, gaming, tech and i hung out with dudes a lot. but i've always been attracted to guys and crushed on guys my entire life and DEFINITELY have feelings for guys. however i noticed that i tend to be attracted to guys who are a bit more expressive. there are girls i find pretty, but i wouldn't find myself being attracted to them in the same way. i actually kind of like being a girl with masculine interests because i think it's cool. i definitely feel comfortable in my body, i like all my lady bits, i love dressing up now (although i dress minimal/chic).\n\nwhen i graduated college, i moved to the bay area, which is a pretty male dominated city. i started questioning if im non binary when i was talking about dating with my friend, and she asked me if i was gay and i said no, and she kept pushing me and telling me 'you never know', almost to the point where it felt like she was confident i wasn't straight even though i was sure i was at the time.\n\nit made me question myself because dating's been pretty shit and it made me wonder if guys just think i'm not feminine enough or something, and made me think about my more masculine tendencies and that maybe they mean something. also made me question why i don't have many close female friends. i have a couple female friends who are also kinda like me--female, creative, say 'dude' a lot, like sports, but straight. but i dress well and found a style that fits me, and my makeup is very light/natural but i enjoy wearing it (bb cream, lip balm, blush) and i definitely don't feel attracted to girls."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'am i non binary?', 'created': 1574779525.0}"

TW: sexual assault

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember, I have been terrified of my father and men in general. He emotionally and physically abused me and my youngest sibling, but I always remember him being nicer to my middle sibling (I am the oldest.) I can't remember any of my childhood, especially around 7-9 years old. I thought this was because of my depression, which later got diagnosed as bipolar II. I started new medication and have started going to therapy, which has resulted in a lot of talking about my dad. For years (all through high school up until now at 23) I have felt like something traumatic happened to me besides the abuse. I just could not remember what exactly happened. I knew it was something sexual and something to do with my father. I just kept pushing it away because thats my dad, why would my dad do that? I have been having a lot of flashbacks of bits and pieces of memories of being abused. Last night, I kept having little flashbacks of times I was possibly sexually assaulted from random men grabbing me, to my ex coercing me to a friend in elementary school that made me watch porn with her and masturbate in front of her. Thats when the memory of my dad touching me came up. It was such a small memory, but it was so vivid. So vivid that I had nightmares all night and couldn't sleep much because closing my eyes scared me.

I feel like maybe it isn't true because I can't remember it all. I feel like my brain is just trying to hurt me. When I was 13 I reported my dad to my guidance counselor for touching my back and legs under my clothes and my whole family was insanely angry at me. I have no one else to talk to about this until I go to therapy next week, so i figured i would post here and maybe get some help. I don't know who to talk to, what to do or what to say.

I knew it was something sexual and something to do with my father. I just kept pushing it away because thats my dad, why would my dad do that? I have been having a lot of flashbacks of bits and pieces of memories of being abused. Last night, I kept having little flashbacks of times I was possibly sexually assaulted from random men grabbing me, to my ex coercing me to a friend in elementary school that made me watch porn with her and masturbate in front of her. Thats when the memory of my dad touching me came up. It was such a small memory, but it was so vivid. So vivid that I had nightmares all night and couldn't sleep much because closing my eyes scared me.\n\nI feel like maybe it isn't true because I can't remember it all. I feel like my brain is just trying to hurt me. When I was 13 I reported my dad to my guidance counselor for touching my back and legs under my clothes and my whole family was insanely angry at me. I have no one else to talk to about this until I go to therapy next week, so i figured i would post here and maybe get some help. I don't know who to talk to, what to do or what to say. I want to block my father on everything and pretend he doesn't exist. My whole being feels numb and grey."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""Did this really happen??

Rather than taking cis people's word for that I figured it would be better to get the opinions of non-binary people. If people could answer the following questions I'd really appreciate it, especially if you're from the UK:

* Do you find the option of 'other' offensive?
* If you were building the drop down which options would you give?
* As opinion towards these matters differ in different cultures what country are you from?

2019-11-28 20:23:40,e33p3e,3,1,"I thought I'd share this story here, for some background I'm AFAB and prefer they/them pronouns. 

On monday I had a performance review with my line manager who is also the centre manager where I work, these meetings are as much for me to talk about any concerns/needs as there are for my manager to evaluate my performance. The meeting went well, she was happy with my progress. Recently I had to pull out of some overtime for a couple of reasons, partly because I had more stuff on that weekend than I realised when I signed up for it and partly because my anxiety has been a little worse the last few weeks and I needed to not overwork myself. 

One of the reasons my anxiety has spiked is because getting incorrectly gendered all the time because I'm not out to many people is starting to really get to me, plus my family still using the wrong pronouns even though I'm out to them. I think they're trying and I know they do love me, but the fact that they never get them right makes it feel like they aren't trying because they don't care and I find it hard to correct them.

My manager was perfectly fine with me pulling out of the overtime and brought it up only to ask if I was doing okay, she knows that I've struggled with anxiety in the past and I have had to take time off work for it before (this was 4 weeks sick leave with full pay, I love my job) I said I was stressed about stuff going on in my personal life, she said she was there to support me with anything, not just work related things and if it was important to me it was important to her, she asked me if I had anyone else to talk to about it (which I don't)

I decided to tell her and I'm very glad I did, she told me that a friend of her son was trans (MtF) so she had come across it before, she had heard of nonbinary but said she didn't really know a lot about it. She asked me if i minded her doing her own research about it and said she wanted to look into how to best support me in the workplace. She assured me that everything would be confidential (which I never doubted) and then when she wrote up the notes she didn't include my coming out (she wrote that we had discussed something personal) because those notes can be seen by the rest of the management team. It was a really positive experience and I'm really glad I did it. 

At this point I'm rambling a bit but I'm on a roll now, and I want to explain why I don't want to come out to my whole workplace.  I work at a salvation army homelessness hostel and I also go to the salvation army church in my area, because of the strong links between the two I can't come out at work without also coming out to my church. This is a shame really because I would feel fine coming out at work, we have a great team and while I'm sure none of them would know what non binary is, I'm sure they would all just go 'ok' and move on and not really treat me any differently. I also think the majority of my church would be the same, it's the minority who wouldn't. 

I do intend to come out at some point, I have a tentative plan to come out before pride 2020 so that I can go but I'm not sure yet. Sorry this got so long but I really wanted to get this off my chest. 

Also wasn't sure which flair to use so I thought I'd focus on the positive and go with YAY",NonBinary,Coming out to my boss,1574997820.0,"{'created_utc': 1574972620, 'id': 'e33p3e', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""I thought I'd share this story here, for some background I'm AFAB and prefer they/them pronouns. \n\nOn monday I had a performance review with my line manager who is also the centre manager where I work, these meetings are as much for me to talk about any concerns/needs as there are for my manager to evaluate my performance.

I'm an afab person who's kind of questioning my gender. I'm queer and ace and coming to terms with those things was a process. The way that I've been feeling about the idea of a non binary identity has been feeling similar to the way I felt about other parts of my identity but I'm still unsure....

2019-11-29 06:09:06,e3aqd9,4,1,"Hi everybody. I'm new here, happy to find this sub. I apologize if my thoughts are all over the place, it's late here and I've eaten a lot of turkey! I'm 33, female, lesbian, married to a great lady. I'm trying to sort out some complicated gender feels lately and just need a safe space to do so.

I guess I'm just wondering if my experience is relatable to ya'll here? Wondering if I might actually be NB or a flavor of genderqueer I don't know of yet. Since I came out as gay 8 years ago, I've slowly found myself exploring my gender. Right away when I came out, I chopped my hair off. It felt like the most freeing thing I had ever done! 

Then I chucked most of my wardrobe - I had always felt deeply uncomfortable in the feminine clothes I owned, but I was too afraid to change bc I was worried I'd out myself to my family. I had never developed a personal style prior to coming out. Almost immediately I found myself drawn to a more androgynous presentation. At first, it was just little things: men's shoes, women's clothes with bits of menswear styling. Over the years that grew to include a preference for men's sweaters and shirts. Then last year, I bought a binder.

From the first time I wore it, I felt a huge change in myself - my confidence soared, the way I moved and carried myself changed. I looked in the mirror and suddenly all the things I didnt like about myself ""clicked"" and felt integrated, comfortable, and okay. 

It's not like I dislike my boobs or actively even think about them much? Yet when they are gone under a binder I just... feel better, more like me. When I picture myself aging, I picture myself looking like Tig Notaro I guess? Lol. I dunno if I'm making sense.

I still had (and have) ""feminine days"" where I enjoy rocking a dress and makeup. But somehow when I do it, it feels subversive, almost like a good joke that no one's in on, but me. It's fun.  But i spend the whole time hyperaware of my presentation; when I'm done, I'm DONE and have to get outta that dress ASAP or I totally crumble.

I don't feel that way when I'm presenting androgynously, especially when I bind. I feel like I sink into myself, like wrapping up in cozy blanket.

Lately I've been trying out different ways of dealing with my body hair, too. I'm blessed/cursed with extremely thick and dense hair. Awesome for my head! Not as awesome for my legs or underarms. Mostly because I've always hated shaving, but I also feel intensely uncomfortable keeping my legs and underarms natural. Recently I tried just using a good quality electric clipper to trim my leg hair to a short length without totally obliterating it. Turns out it felt SO RIGHT. Tidy and intentional and very me.

At first, these changes felt performative. Like I was testing out different ways of being perceived by others. Like i was testing out the different ways i would be treated by others. Nowadays, it feels more like I'm experiencing different ways of BEING. It's not as much about perception anymore. It's become about comfort.

There are some other areas that I feel like are complicating my thoughts on this. I was a tomboy growing up, and always fully resisted anything traditionally feminine. I was the kid who got physically uncomfortable in the ""pink"" aisle at the toy store. I also had a very traumatic childhood, mainly thanks to my mom. Am i just trying to distance myself from her? These feelings don't FEEL like a trauma (I have plenty of baggage, this doesn't feel like that) but its hard for me NOT to examine every feeling. Also, I was born without a uterus (though I have ovaries). I found out when I was 16. It didn't really bother me; every woman I knew was tearful and trying to console me about never having kids, but it legitimately felt like nothing for me. A non-issue.

I dont really mind being called a woman. I don't mind being called she/her. They/them sounds nice too. I definitely don't want to be called he/him. I guess I just feel like ""woman"" or ""she/her"" can't hold the entirety of me? Like it's one ingredient in my recipe but not the whole thing. I used to think I was proud of being a woman, but I'm starting to think lately I'm more proud of being SOCIALIZED as a woman and all that entails. When I think of what I'm actually proud of, its my empathy, kindness, strength, fierceness, and resilience. And how my shared experience and history with other women helped shape these things in me. 

I'll end with one random thought I had yesterday as I was singing along to Christmas music. My whole life, I've hated my voice, to the point of shame hearing a tape of myself (literally, I would hide in the bathroom when family tapes were played). It's deeper than the other women I know. 

Its most apparent in my comfortable singing range. Over the years, I trained myself to sing in higher registers even though it was a strain, bc every time I heard myself singing (not on tape, just in real time), i would find it so jarring it would disgust and unnerve me. Well, yesterday while driving I allowed myself to sing along in my normal range. And I actually LIKED how I sounded. And how I wished I could sing like that and have it feel consistent with my gender... like it wouldn't be a surprising voice to myself or to listeners. It's really hard to put into words, argh.

     I used to be pretty conservative, and some of the ideas I used to have leaked into my current views. In particular there’s the idea of masculine and feminine traits defining gender.
     It’s a pretty common argument I think. Basically, some people are more masculine or feminine than others; but this doesn’t have to mean you’re a different gender. It just means you are a more masculine or feminine boy or girl.

Stopped taking hormones because they have downsides for me and what’s the point now. Estranged from family but have no motivation to try to detransition even if it would help there. Just question why I have to be such a fuckup all the time.

Now just about everything is triggering, can’t get support from anywhere without running into transmisogyny, transphobia, terf shit, transmedicalism... racism, ableism, everything else, depending on what it is I’m not always the target but it’s still horrible and I can’t cope. 

Views I do or don’t agree with about transness are triggering at this point because it just reminds me of my mistakes. Other trans people are triggering because I feel like a mistake and because I don’t want to be rejected for provoking anxiety as a transition failure. Frantic detransitioners are triggering for obvious reasons. Cis people are cis. Etc.

Basically after all this I’m more messed up and alone than ever and with these problems from surgery plus my neverending fatigue issues it’s just too much sometimes. But at the same time it literally doesn’t matter if anything is too much, because it doesn’t mean anything will change or “has to change” for the better. That has uhhhhh become crystal clear. So this is my life. 

Sorry normally I wouldn’t come across as so bizarre and agitated, it’s just because of the anxiety attack. I truly don’t “need” support but it would be nice. Lol. Just please don’t expect me to respond.

2019-11-30 01:00:01,e3o8aa,2,1,"Hey everyone, new to this community, been playing around within pronouns for a couple years now. In new circles I’m confident to announce my pronouns as they/them but haven’t really gotten the courage to correct people when they don’t use that. Haven’t come out to my family. I feel like I’ve really come into my own lately and just was searching a group to share with. 

Been thinking about top surgery for a really long time. I’ve always had dysphoria when it comes to my chest. (Haven’t tried binding yet if anyone has any recommendations) even went to therapy to try and delve out my feelings about it. But my therapist ended up really making it a discussion about my reaction to others reacting to me, instead of my internal feelings. Which I guess is helpful when it comes to discerning whether my feelings come from misogyny and society. But it ended up just confusing if I should even pursue that route. I’ve also had a lot of partners comment on how they like my chest when I bring up maybe getting surgery and it’s never felt like a real conversation about me.
