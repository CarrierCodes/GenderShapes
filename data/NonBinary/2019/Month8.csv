2019-08-01 11:28:02,ckn488,5,8,"Hello friends 😊 

Maybe someone else is in a similar situation. From birth being assigned as male, in reality I´m just feeling as a genderless human beeing 🙂 I don´t  bemoan my male genitals but female ones would also be totally ok for me. Optically, talking about my body proportions I have the luck not to appear extremly masculine but regardless I´m still being gendered mostly as a male. This in some way doesn´t let me feel very comfortable. It would be great to slide a bit more from male to female. Especially breast growth, softer skin and less body hair would be a quite important deal for me. 

So now to achive this, I got tube of estradiol gel, but I´m not really sure what to do 🙈 The prescribed dose from the doctor are 2 pumps a day. This in fact would give me everything I´m seeking for. The only, but at the same time very huge struggle is the thing with my fertility. Despite being pansexual I´d really like to have children one day and for this to keep all of my body functions considering this, intact. 

So long story short: If you only take estradiol without anything else and at a low dose, will it affect the male testicles in a way that it causes permanent damage? Will they irreversibly shrink and completely stop producing testosterone and sperms? Will I then permanently depend on hormone supplements to stay healthy, even if microdosing or am I just panicking?

Yesterday I had a sit down with the customer service director and brought up my discomfort. While I didn't feel like it was my time to come out, I did mention how sad it made me feel to hear disparagement and came at it from it being an unprofessional attitude. I asked if we could introduce diversity training and other forms of inclusivity around the office. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the CSD agreed and was upset to hear that these sorts of things had been going on. The CSD mentioned that diversity training is a great start and it's going to be pitched to the executive team ASAP.

But intermittently, and especially now, I'm wondering if I might actually be nonbinary instead. Most recently this line of thinking came up again because the way that I'd like to present (at times) is very “feminine”. So it keeps giving me impostor syndrome, because while wearing certain things would make me dysphoric, it's what I'd be happiest in.

The version of me that makes me happiest when I imagine it in my head isn't necessarily gendered, it's just me, and it's not necessary male or female. The thought of being undefinable and ambiguous  is something that makes me really happy and kinda gives me gender euphoria (?) but I feel like part of why I like the idea of it is because of my personal values surrounding gender, and also because dysphoria. And the idea of fucking with people's heads like that makes me laugh. And when I consider my actual self, I don't necessarily consider myself masculine or feminine either, because the idea of certain traits being masculine or feminine is all bunk to me. As for which one I feel like at my core, I'd say it's kinda just it's own thing, but leaning towards masculine...but kinda watered down. I don't know. Perhaps I'm nonbinary but masculine of center.

2019-08-02 20:58:04,cl9tps,3,9,"Hi, everyone. I’m Polar. 22 years old, AFAM. Until I was 20, I firmly identified as a cisgender woman.

When the summer after my 20th birthday came around, I knew something felt off—that something had changed—but I couldn’t figure out what.

I didn’t feel comfortable in my own body anymore. I had periods of depersonalization/derealization during high school, but this was worse. When I brought myself to question my gender identity, the mold broke.

“Normal [cisgender] people don’t question their genders, so I must not be normal,” I thought.

Yet, even though female didn’t feel “right,” male didn’t feel right, either. I felt caught between both or felt like neither, stuck outside the spectrum.

So I identified as non-binary. Being neither exclusively female nor male felt right to me. Gender fluid was too shifting and genderqueer felt too androgynous.

I couldn’t find the words to express how I felt, and it confused and worried my parents, especially my mother.

When I discovered chest binders, I ordered two (size large) from gc2b and hid them from my parents. When I was able to get one on, it was glorious. I wore intermittently for about three months.

Then, it just kind of went away. I don’t know if I repressed it or not, but I felt uncomfortable wearing the binders, so I put them away.

Fast forward two years, I’ve lost weight and donated most of my old bras. I came across the binders and, even though they’re a size too big now, I still got that same giddy feeling as I did when I first wore them.

I’m planning to keep them, as gc2b recommends wearing a size up from your primary size when you’re exercising or swimming, anyway.

There’s some slight gapping at the bottom of the binder, but not so much that it’s too loose.

I’m no longer uncomfortable with my breasts, but I did enjoy how I looked and felt with the binder on. There are some days when I want my breasts and other days when I don’t.

I know that no one can answer this besides me, but some guidance would be appreciated.

Backstory: I have known this person since I was 4 and they recently came out as non-binary (they/them). I try very hard to use the correct pronouns, but I have definitely slipped up a few times to my chagrin. This happened several weeks ago when we we threw a big party to celebrate my mom finishing chemo, and I’m wondering if I could have handled it better.

I was telling a story about my friends and me as kids, and after finishing the story I realized I had accidentally used the wrong pronoun once. I froze up and didn’t know what to do, because a lot of people were listening and I wasn’t sure if  apologizing and correcting myself after the fact would make my friend more uncomfortable by drawing attention to them. I will also add that there were some irritating older relatives there who have expressed skepticism of non-binary gender identity to me, and I feel responsible for affirming my friend’s identity in front of those people. I tried to wait for a break in the conversation to apologize, but by that point the topic had shifted entirely and it seemed too awkward to bring it up, so I ended up texting my friend later that evening to apologize.

I haven't felt able to do any of these things yet though because I live \~45 minutes from my parents and still see them very often.

I came out to my parents 4 years ago. Mom didn't take it well, Dad took it better but still not fully accepting, and since then they have both kinda... pretended I never came out. They still use the wrong name and pronouns for me, and we haven't discussed it since, but I think they thought my coming out was just a phase that I'm out of now (spoiler alert: not a phase, still very NB). Though I don't rely on my parents for much, I am still on their insurance til I turn 25/26 (whichever it is now), so I'm holding off on anything medical til then. But otherwise, just knowing that they would probably stop talking to me is keeping me from transitioning.

Family matters a lot to me because I used to not get along with my parents well, especially not with my mom, but since I've moved out for college we get along much better, and this is something that I don't want to change. I would hate to ruin this tentatively better relationship I have with my parents, but I don't think I can have a healthy relationship with them and transition at the same time. I don't think I can transition much either without them finding out--I see them too much, and I'm on their insurance, so they'd find out about any legal or medical transition pretty quick, so trying to be subtle about it isn't an option. 

I still can't figure out which is more important to me, having a good relationship with my parents or living more authentically (when I'm not happy with how I look but not unhappy either, just very neutral). I feel like if my parents stopped talking to me once I began transitioning, or even if I just came out again to affirm I'm still NB, I'd be the one regretting ruining that relationship even though I know it's their unwillingness to accept me that is ruining the relationship.

For me, there are some days when I feel more feminine, some masculine, some androgynous, and some neither gender. That’s when/why I first identified as non-binary, because I didn’t feel exclusively male or female, despite being AFAB.

I’d never consider permanent breast surgery, so that’s why I use temporary methods like compression binding or tape binding.

What’s the best way to put on and take off a binder?

I tried putting one on today and the back panel got twisted. Is there any way to prevent that from happening?

I panicked a little trying to take it off and followed this [guide](https://www.deviantart.com/oddsocket/art/Tutorial-how-to-take-off-get-out-of-a-binder-530514050) as best as I could, but I couldn’t get the back panel to fold up the way I wanted it to.

I eventually got the binder up around my underarms and was able to get it off by pulling up the back panel.

I know that the panel is stretchy and resilient, and that yanking on it a few times won’t damage it, but I don’t want to consistently do that. I want to wear them without damaging them.

I also plan on getting new ones, so what’s the best way to stretch them without over-stretching them?

Ever since I came out (a couple of months) my mother has been missgendering me. Not on purpose, though she isn't trying very hard. It feels bad, but she has a hard time remembering things like that anyway, so I let it go, thinking that was it.

The other day my mom and I were talking about another non-binary person who also uses gender neutral pronouns, and she kept referring to them by name (\*insert name here\* does this, \*insert name here\* said that), at which point I realized It's not all about remembering. She remembers they identify using gender neutral pronouns and is purposefully avoiding it. When I confronted her about it, she said it was because it's grammatically incorrect, and blah blah. I tried to explain it to her, told her to think of it as if she doesn't know their gender (because she said she can recognized their agab). But she insisted saying that it's just difficult for her because she is from a different generation. I told her it's probably not the reason, and that she was just uneducated on this subject, because I (and many others) felt the same way before learning about it properly. She threw back any explanation I had with a ""It'll just take me some time to get used to it"". But how is she gonna get used to it if she won't learn about it, or even once, use my preferred pronouns. 

I'm lucky to have people in my life that no matter what, accept and love me. But she is the only person I thought actually supported and encouraged me (everybody else kind of treats it as a 'joke' or just a phase). She keeps telling me how happy and proud she is by the positive change it's made in me, how I've finally found what I had so desperately been looking for for 6 years, yet she still hasn't used they/them. I've poured my heart out trying to explain its importance to me so many times, just to be met back with \*agab\*, it makes me feel not valid.

Do you think it's just going to take time, like she said? Or should I keep trying to explain it to her until it's stuck in her head forever?

I've only mentioned the possibility of changing my name to a few trusted people briefly. Only my partner knows what my new name is. 

I've had a name in mind for years that I've always envisioned myself using when I am ""more out"" about being non binary. I pictured myself being brave and taking on this new name as soon as I ""come out more"" by telling my family about my identity and being ""more out"" in college. I didn't want to change my name in the past when I was halfway through university and face any potential push back from my classmates and profs. So I figured I should wait until college to enact this change when I'll be meeting a bunch of new people, instead of facing this giant hurdle when my peers have already known me by another name for years. I also always told myself that I would come out to my parents the summer before entering college.

This has been the plan for years and now its coming up in a few weeks, and I'm terrified. 

I don't know if its because of these nervous feelings or something else but I'm second guessing whether my ""new name"" really fits. I'm doubting myself, the new name doesn't feel like me the same way my current name doesn't feel like me. But it's not like there's a more recent different name that's attracting me now, it's just that nothing feels like ""me"". Suddenly I'm doubting a lot of what I though would be certain about my future and how I come out and how i get myself finally be ""me"".

I'm worried that I'm taking too big a step in such a short period of time by changing my name very publicly. I'm worried that I'll quickly realize that this new name isn't for me and I'll have to go through some sort of backlash by changing my name again. 

I'm not sure if anyone else felt this way while coming out or has any advice. I just haven't had much luck in finding others who may have felt this way and how they coped.

Warning for semi-graphic description of surgery at the end.

So essentially, I was watching videos of top surgery procedures as a way to mentally prep myself and get used to the idea of what my body will go through when I finally get surgery. The videos were fairly graphic, given they are literally showing a live surgery, and I told my friends my thoughts about it because that’s something I’m literally going to go through and I wanted to talk to /someone/ about it.

One of my friends thought it was as interesting as I did since she’s very into surgery (and medical procedures in general), while my other friend who is a trans guy got upset about it and was like “dude what the fuck”. I apologized for being graphic even before he said anything, but he was still upset about it and his response to me apologizing a second time was basically “I don’t want to read that because I’m going to go through it someday”.  

And that’s basically where we start the problem because /I am also going to go through this surgery/ that’s literally why I was talking about it. And he continued to act like I’m an uninvolved third-party talking about something only he will experience which was extremely frustrating to me.  Like he emphasized how top-surgery is /for him/ when I am also getting it to alleviate my own dysphoria.

I understand it could be a bit out of line to describe it as “the muscle and fat is exposed and they shove their hand up under the skin/ you can see the muscle twitch when it’s cauterized” but like that’s literally what happens?? And I apologized for my description of it but he still acted like I don’t deserve to talk about it when we’re both afab and trans masculine, I just haven’t fully committed to aligning as “male”. 

On further thought it could have triggered his dysphoria which sucks ass and I hope that’s not the case, but even then I don’t understand why he was treating it like I’m not also undergoing the procedure and mentally preparing myself too.",NonBinary,Idk I needed to vent about a thing that my friend said but it’s not that serious,1565086276.0,"{'created_utc': 1565061076, 'id': 'cml65j', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 4, 'selftext': '(Sorry for bad formatting, I’m on mobile.) \n\nWarning for semi-graphic description of surgery at the end.\n\nSo essentially, I was watching videos of top surgery procedures as a way to mentally prep myself and get used to the idea of what my body will go through when I finally get surgery.

2019-08-06 08:23:28,cmnwis,1,16,"Hi, I recently came out as Non-Binary to my mom and younger bro. I'm 26. It was as easy as expected. Those two have always been more receptive to my identity and the fluid world that it has always been than anyone else. I sat down with them separately and attempted to share a portion of my lived experience that I've kept in the dark for reasons such as a lack of adequate language to somewhat explain what and who I am, proper environment, or real support. 


I'm at a point in my life where I possess that once absent language and now have what I feel like is an emotionally and mentally safe environment. Half of that is due to a recent and, if I'm being honest, long awaited seperation between my mom and dad, and the other half is accounted for by my constant search to find my language and a string of difficult but honest life-choices. 


I've always known what I am, but that ""knowing"" was more often overwhelmed by the reactions of others than honored as a response from within. The result being years of torment with small moments of relief. When I came out I told my family that being a concentrated and imposed entity is literally hell.

2019-08-06 22:09:14,cmwy52,2,10,"So. There was a weird old guy in the park today and he started his weird rambling little speech with something like 'sir, ma'am, whatever you like to be called'. It's not important what he actually said - it was weird and rambling and I was left very baffled and slightly uncomfortable but also amused by the ensuing 'compliment'. Anyway, not the point. 

The title line here is my girlfriend's response after he left. She was offended on my behalf. And on her behalf I guess. She'd been exposed to him before and he was insistent she'd find a boyfriend (yeah this old guy is weird). So me being read as a guy invalidates her identity as a lesbian. Which makes sense. And it's not even like I'm out to her about my gender. I'm barely even out to myself.

I'm proud of my androgyny though. Or at least my moments of it. And so even if it was just manifested homophobia coming from a weird guy (because I was dressed more femme than usual today so let's face it I probably didn't even look androgynous) I sort of enjoyed the moment. I didn't speak because I didn't know what to say but also on some level because I didn't want to give myself away with my voice. It seems so dumb in retrospect. 

But I know I'm not supposed to be proud of being occasionally able to be mistaken for the opposite sex. I'm supposed to be offended. I know my gnc girlfriend probably isn't actually judging my gender expression. But to know that she sees me so definitively (and importantly for her lesbian identity) as female, kinda...kinda stings a little.

The thing is at the end of the day she's probably more invested in my gender than me. And I'm not desperately planning to change my body's sex characteristics in the near future. Or even my pronouns. And I already know she'll be cool with my name change. 

So I'm not sure I can put a finger on this feeling, not just today but in general. I don't feel like a lesbian but I don't feel straight or bi either. I've got the asexual thing down... and gender wise I don't know how I feel but I'm fairly certain I'm overthinking it because I always do.

It seems so dumb in retrospect. \n\nBut I know I'm not supposed to be proud of being occasionally able to be mistaken for the opposite sex. I'm supposed to be offended. I know my gnc girlfriend probably isn't actually judging my gender expression. But to know that she sees me so definitively (and importantly for her lesbian identity) as female, kinda...kinda stings a little.\n\nThe thing is at the end of the day she's probably more invested in my gender than me. And I'm not desperately planning to change my body's sex characteristics in the near future. Or even my pronouns. And I already know she'll be cool with my name change. \n\nSo I'm not sure I can put a finger on this feeling, not just today but in general. I don't feel like a lesbian but I don't feel straight or bi either. I've got the asexual thing down... and gender wise I don't know how I feel but I'm fairly certain I'm overthinking it because I always do.\n\nI don't know what I want."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""Story time: 'I zoned out when he said ma'am/sir'"", 'created': 1565154554.0}"

I know that non-binary is an identity by itself, but it’s also an umbrella term for other identities.

That’s four distinct “feelings,” but I don’t consider them strong enough to be separate genders on their own. Therefore, genderfluid is out. Would that be genderflux, or another identity?

4. Started binding with sports bras and layered shirts as soon as puberty hit, before I knew that was a ""trans"" thing to do.
5. Played animals and monsters in online RPG's as a kid so I wouldn't be clocked immediately as a girl
6. Hated pink until I saw men wearing it, then liked it because color doesn't equal gender. 
7. Accepted trans people (but wasn't entirely woke about them) prior to accepting gay people (Grew up in a homophobic/transphobic small conservative town) 
8. Got euphoric being addressed as 'they/them' by a professor in college and was sad as soon as I was gendered female again.

So I'll be brutally honest. My sister now identifies as non binary, and I think it's a product of her crowd, and not who she is as a person. I think it's attention seeking.

I'll lay out the progression.

Step 1: Everyday girly girl. 0-14

Step 2: Discovers tumblr 14-15

Step 3: Finds alt sexuality communities and gets deeply involved 15-16

Step 4: Starts dying hair and dressing in what I would describe as butch lesbian (again I'm being brutally honest here). 16

Step 5: My spidey senses are tingling and I tease her (kindly, we have a solid relationship) about being a lesbian 16-17

Step 6: She tells me she's pansexual and starts dating women. Her first lesbian relationship goes badly and she starts dating men. 17-18

Step 7: She changes her name to a male name, and tells everyone she's non binary. Now on the 4th relationship she's still dating men. -19

&amp;#x200B;

And now we're at the present. I feel like she ""they"" has developed an identity to fit in with the crowd she met on tumblr. I feel like it's attention seeking. I don't feel like it's genuine. And I think her tumblr crowd seriously fucked with her mental state in her formative teenage years. I don't think she'd be wrapped up in being non binary if she hadn't discovered tumblr.

&amp;#x200B;

Before you go off on me, I'm 100% okay with her doing her, and I've supported her every step of the way. But despite that I'm struggling with feeling like it's not her doing her, and it's her conforming to fit a crowd that she fell into. And in the sexual vacuum of her teenage years, she got sucked into trying to be someone she wouldn't have been.

2019-08-09 09:16:17,cnzuze,11,17,"Hi folks, I'm new here and fairly new to this whole thing, looking for some advice/clarity. I'm a 33 year old woman/afab who think I might be leaning towards the gender fluid spectrum. Here is some back story:

From as far back as I can remember in my childhood I was attracted to women. I came out as a lesbian in my early teens, and for about a decade I was also very fascinated with androgynous gender expressions. In that time and place where I grew up there was no concept about non-binary or gender fluid as a gender identification, had that been a thing with which I was familiar I would probably have identified as such. I remember my goal was to look like ""a boy who looks like a girl who looks like a boy"". I cut my hair short and was binding my breasts for a while, but it wasn't a lot of dysphoria associated with it, mostly just not wanting to associate to any one gender, but exist in-between, or as both simultaneously. 

When I was 22 I had dated my first girlfriend for four years, and things were headed down a path of stability and life-long commitment that I increasingly felt I wasn't ready for. I wanted to go out and see the world (and other people - she was my first) which lead me to break up with her, which I did in an awful and messy way due to being young and emotionally immature and unprepared for dealing with this. In this whole chaos I ended up dating a mutual friend, in secret, and when this came out me and my new girlfriend were shunned by our group of friends, which incidentally also happened to be a large part of the queer community in the city where we all lived. A year and a half later me and the new girlfriend broke up, and shortly thereafter I ended up dating a guy from my school. This was the last nail in the coffin for me in the eyes of the queer community, and I was no longer welcome there.

After that, I for some unknown reason have mostly been attracted to men. I grew my hair out (unrelated event) and was horrified what a difference it was to be on the ""correct"" side of the whole sexuality/gender expression spectrum in terms of how people treated me (""correct"" in the eyes of the bullshit made up rules opposed on us by society). I haven't been with a woman since then, not out of some principle, just because I have always only gone with what feels right, and as young never questioned or felt weirded out by my attraction to women as it felt completely natural to me, and now I mostly feel that way towards men (and tomboy girls). Then things just kind of went along this way until a little while ago.

All throughout this time, though, I have always dreamed of having a man's body in terms of a beard and a penis. I will have dreams about this at least once a week. I have mostly thought of this as ""ah bummer, I really wish I could have this but I guess it'll never happen"" the same way you might dream about flying or such. I will add that this isn't combined with any particular dysphoria around my female body, just a desire to have that as well, or sometimes instead of. Then a month back a friend of mine was visiting me from the US. She is very involved in the queer community where she lives and we talked a lot about this, I expressed my feelings that I no longer have a place there because of mostly dating men, and probably to a large part from that trauma of being shunned by my whole circle of friends (I now have new, amazing friends). I remember how annoyed we were when people would claim to be gay and then only date people of the opposite sex, and I didn't want to burden the community with that, also I have had a lot of guilt around my own sexuality happening to perfectly fit the whole, made up stupid cliché of ""it's just a phase"". I have felt that while for me, personally, my sexuality just is what it happens to be, if I disclosed it to others it could be harmful for the queer community. So I just don't have a name for it. Anyways, my friend who visited had a much more forgiving look on things which was inspiring. Then one day we compared dreams of the previous night, and I recounted one of my reoccurring dreams of waking up with a dick and being all ecstatic about it. I then told her of how it was such a shame that I could never have that. She just kind of said, well maybe you can explore that some, and it was like she kicked open a door by saying that. I have not been able to get it out of my head since. Pretty much after that day I have had this intense longing to present more as male/gender fluid, I'm cutting my hair short next week and am so excited to try this out. I'm also trying to flatten my chest with sport bras and such.

I guess my question is, I just don't know what to do with this. I feel like I can't claim my place within this community for the reasons stated above, and I don't know if what I'm experiencing is gender fluidity or some related identity.  I read somewhere that wanting to dress a certain way doesn't make you gender fluid as that is rather a state of mind than your outward expression. This feels different than an aesthetic choice, though, but I also don't dare to trust my instincts enough as clearly I'm changing between polarities (gay/straight, femme looking/not-femme looking now, I guess?) and it seems to take some decade to circle through these phases too. Also it has just been a month, so who the heck knows, even if it feels like a revelation, like I have unlocked some aspect of myself. And also I'm 33, and all the other people who struggle with these thoughts seem to be around 1,5-two decades my junior. I don't want to impose myself in a community of people who experience a whole lot more profound feelings of dysphoria/gender identity than myself, which I also recognize is kind of a messed up way to look at it.

I've been working on accepting the idea of being non-binary for a bit now, rather than simply convincing myself I am female and then avoiding thinking about or acknowledging the subject as much as possible.  And while non-binary seems to fit well with how I regard myself, I still have a few hesitations in actually accepting the label.

One of the big ones is my mom.  I have no idea how she felt regarding non-binary or trans people  or even the grsm community as we never discussed it and she died when I was 13 (I am now 31).  One thing I do know however is that she really wanted a girl.  I have four older brothers and am the only daughter she had.

2019-08-09 15:00:00,co3iy5,14,12,"Yes. Hello. 

I’m new here and I need some sort of advice or validation or I may go insane. 


I’m an afab. My entire life i’ve had issues with the way that I’ve been seen solely as a female. When I was around 7/8 I started feeling weirded out when someone referred to me as “she”. 

However now, as an adult, i am totally okay with being referred to as “she”, and even if someone would say “he” that wouldn’t really mind that either. 

Instead of feeling like my gender moves, or changes, I feel that I am everything and nothing all at once. If “alien” was a gender identity i’d go with that. It’s been driving me absolutely up the wall for years now and I think after feeling things out, and experimenting with being bi-gender (which didn’t work, and felt uncomfortable) 

I think i’ve landed on non-binary and the more research I do and the more I start to see myself as a human, as myself, rather than just a woman or just a man, the more comfortable I become. 

I lean more towards feminine clothes and presenting as a female, but when I know people see me that way it causes me extreme discomfort. And I wish more people looked at me and saw a “them”. As i’ve sort of become more comfortable with it I’d like to be called by they/them pronouns, but i’m also fine with any of them. None of them cause me discomfort. But the lack of gender is where my heart lies and who I am at the core of my being regardless of how feminine I look or what my sex is. 

I’m a streamer on twitch and there’s a video game called Apex Legends and one of the characters (and mine that i play with) is completely non binary. they/them pronouns and the creators are very straightforward about them being an enigma. A powerful genderless enigma that is just..... what they are. And they can’t be put into a box. 

I almost cry when I think about that character. I’m almost living vicariously through them because I’ve only come out to 2 people. Only 2 people on the planet know I feel this way. And I’m scared. I’m scared of coming out. I’m scared what my boyfriend will think. I’m scared of it but I also want to be seen as who i am (they/them) instead of something i’m okay with (she/her) 

I’m thinking that my obsession with this character may be a starting point to me at the very least living my life within my friends and family the way that I want to. 


I know this is long, and I’m sorry I just needed to vent. I don’t have a community or anyone irl to talk to about this. And within finding a character that i relate too so much that it makes me cry tears of absolute joy and closure, has me thinking that I may have finally figured out my gender identity. And that I’m on a road to fully loving myself. For the genderless blob that I am.

2019-08-10 08:11:44,cofecn,4,15,"Hi! This is a throwaway account, only because I’d like to figure myself out before people who know of my main account see me posting about this. 

Since birth, I have identified as a cis female. (I am 24 btw if that matters) But I’ve never felt quite comfortable with it, in ways that are hard to describe. I have always had both feminine and masculine interests (not that any hobbies etc. have genders, but like stereotypically). I grew up playing with dolls with my sister, and digging for worms with my guy friends. I never made lasting friendships with girls, because I always wanted to do the things that they considered ‘boyish.’ In my earlier years, I dressed in all pink and had long hair, but as I’ve grown up, I have worn more ‘men’s’ clothes and have cut (and even shaved) my hair many times. I’ve never been one to like makeup that much, my idea of styling my hair consists of dying it a new color and combing it until it looks decent, I wear more of my husband’s clothes than I do my own. Once, my mom and I were watching a tv show where the word “androgynous” was used, and at that time I didn’t know what it meant. Once she told me, I was amazed at the idea that someone could actually dress and present in a way that was neither and both (at the same time) masculine and feminine. I wanted that, but I was raised in a family where gender stereotypes are heavily enforced. 

In my later years, I started to wonder if I was actually a trans man. I don’t know how to explain it, other than I just didn’t feel comfortable with the idea of being a girl. I just don’t think it fits who I am. I toyed with the idea of presenting as male for a while, but that made me feel just as uncomfortable. Not that it’s a bad thing to be male, or female for that matter, it just didn’t feel like “me.” 

I’ve always had discomfort with my body. The big area of my concern is my chest. I am slightly on the larger size up there, and I despise it. These two boulders on my chest cause me pain daily, both in back pain and mental pain. I developed an eating disorder a few years back because I thought that if I could lose enough weight, these lumps, as well as all other curves of my body, would go away. But of course, that didn’t happen. (I am recovered from the ED now thankfully) I wondered for a long time what was wrong with me, why I couldn’t be happy in my body, why I didn’t feel comfortable with some of the main parts of me and who I am. 

Then, I heard of the term non-binary.

The more I looked into it, the more right it started to feel. The idea of not being a girl, but also not being a boy, fascinated and excited me. For some reason, I had never considered that that was possible. I have my masculine days and I have my feminine days, and that’s always made me doubt who I am. But now, after learning more and more about what being non-binary is, I’m starting to feel like I found the answer. 

I have started using they/them pronouns in a few online circles, and I love it. However, I don’t necessarily mind using she/her pronouns as well. I have started looking into binding as well. My husband helped me wrap my chest with tape one day (only for a few minutes as I’m not sure if using tape is safe) and when I put on a shirt and saw a flat (or at least flatter) chest, I was over the moon. It’s like so many of my insecurities about my body went away for the few moments it lasted. I’ve told my husband that if/when we ever have the money to, I’d like to have my chest surgically flattened, and he is supportive, but I haven’t told him about the other questions about my gender yet. 

Of course, even with all of this, I always have the question in my head of whether or not I’m making all this up. It feels right, but I just don’t know.

Hi, this'll probably be a long one, but I really need to write my thoughts out all at once and have people listen.

**Part one: The journey begins**

I think I should start of chronologically.
One and a half years ago I realized I'm trans, and I came out to a group of online friends and was ""publicly"" out on my reddit account. (I didn't come out to any of my irl friends since I thought like I just didn't have a deep enough friendship to come out to them and was also scared they would be transphobic.) I chose Katrin as my name and used she/her pronouns and started to grow my hair out. However, I always intended to cut it short once I would be able to get HRT and had more of a butch look in mind in general. Back then I thought this was just because I have a slight interest in the punk scene, where more androgynous looks aren't a rarity. I still weirdly felt distant to the general idea of being MtF and sometimes I couldn't identify with the experience of other trans women, for example wasn't I always repulsed by the idea of being a boy and never was really interested in many girl activities. I also wished for a not as feminine and curvy body as other trans women, but I suppose that's all just personal interest.

**Part two: ""Oh no""**

I pretty much was fine with the idea of being butch MtF for about a year until I got an ""Oh no"" moment: I always keep reddit posts of transition goals in a note on my phone and after I went through them I realized most fo them were slightly to very gender non-comforming. I messaged a friend who helped me after I cracked for the first time and told her what was up. They asked me if I want to be called girl or also dislike that. Back then I couldn't answer the question and I just said I would've wanted a female childhood. They also calmed me down by saying they're also kinda gender non-comfirming. After that I just settled on me just being scared of the high expectations society puts on trans people to fit the exact gender roles they're transitioning too, and probably just being *fine* with the idea of being femme nb, but not outright preferring it. So I just kept moving into the direction I was headed before: Butch MtF.

**Part three: Get fucked, homophobes**

Last year I also failed 9th grade for a couple of reasons (mostly being too demotivated too care and being in a less then optimal work atmosphere full of assholes) and had to retake it. In the new class I got *way* easier and befriending people and most of them weren't homophobes. So after a lot of convincing by my online friends I slowly came out to a group of very supportive friends which by chance were all mostly queer too. (We're pretty much the nerdy queer group of our year.) I felt way more comfortable around them and also told them about how I actually prefer more butch looks. 
Because of this new friend group and class I got more confident in myself and didn't fear the homophobic parts of my school as much. So all went great and my plan was working and I slowly considered coming out to my class and parents and all is good and fun... until it all kinda came crashing down the last few weeks.

**Part four: Fuck wait no go back**

As it turns out, this class in which I finally felt like I was welcome for the first time in my school history is going to be split up next year! And even better, my friend group with it! And even better, one of the three to five homophobes of that class will be in my half too! And even better, the other half will be filled with the rest of another class that isn't really welcoming of queer people either. 

Fuck. Please go back.
 
The more important thing for this sub and post is what happened during my vacation: While visiting Romania and my relatives, the thoughts of me being nb got back. This time they were so penetrant, I immediatly started seriously sitting down and discussing my gender identity with myself and friends... is what I *should've* done.

What instead happened, was [this](https://i.imgur.com/RHeM746.jpg).

I messaged my very lovely ldr girlfriend, my sister and that friend I already talked to about this, and said to them that I'm questioning. At one point I wrote a mini theory of my relationship to being non-binary in my notebook/diary, which was concluded with ""I don't have to have a gender because I don't *need* a gender to be myself"", but the next day the confidence and that statement was gone. Then I practically just created stupid avatars, slapped the nb pride flag on them and called it a day until I was up all night just not being able to sleep because of this, just like yesterday when I decided that this has to stop and I *really* should write it all out to figure things out. Thankfully, u/regionalcryptid offered me their help, so I decided to write them that night. Until I relized it was like 2 am and I need sleep, so I instead promised them to write everything out the next morning. (Take a guess what this is...) 

Having concluded the timeline so far, I'd say I should get to the pro, contras and [external screaming.](https://youtu.be/6iP0tSmJiIY).

**Part five: Pro, contra and hmmmm.**

Having already mentioned my list of transition goals, picrews and my self image I think I should start there.

Obviously, whatever I am, I metioned liking to have short hair. Or, well, feminine short hair? Whenever I imagine my ideal self (if that is possible) I rarely have long hair. If a avatar editor doesn't have short hair options, sidecuts or something similar (often what I like to call the [enby]() [mess]() ). My transition goals list is full of either short haired and butch women or, what lately fills it a lot, not overtly feminine non-binary people. At first the enbys where the exception to the rule, but now it's full of them. 
(If I were to use the futch scale to describe my ideal self I'd land somewhere [here.](https://i.imgur.com/cJTm5hm.png))

Next step I suppose is my general relationship with the concept of being non-binary.

This'll sound weird, but I have this weird unexplainable positive feeling towards the idea of being non-binary. Two days ago I kept saying ""I'm non-binary"" over and over again to see how it feels and it just feels *right*. But I just feel like an imposter when I think I'm non-binary, that I'm just faking it for attention. But whenever I think THAT I feel sad that I'm not non-binary. I have no problems with having they/them pronouns, but I also don't dislike she/her pronouns. I don't have that many problems with male clothing and when I have they're often related with being *perceived* as male, not with the clothes themselves. But I also like the idea of dressing gender-neutral and really want to wear a skirt or dress.

And honestly, I just like the idea of me being non-binary even though I don't really believe in it. I just like to imagine to not be confined by gender and just look and act how I want to look and act. (Have fun with your 8 upvotes on r/egg_irl) 

The last bit brings me to the last reason why I'm not sure if I'm non-binary. I feel like I can't pull that of, because I feel like I'll be made fun of and serve as a bad example for non-binary people since I'll almost definitely won't be either completely androgynous nor fit in gender-roles, no matter if I'm MtX or MtF. I couldn't care less, but my environment and the current negative view of non-binary people in the general population hold me back. I don't want to end up as the punching bag of those two jokes conservatives have about trans people nor enforce the stereotype that enbys are just attention craving teens that dye their hair to be quirky. I just feel obligated to avoid the possibility of having the transphobic views of parts of my school and the population be enforced further. 

I simply don't want to make it worse for actual enbys in my town because I just wasn't comfortable with calling myself butch MtF.

I also feel like I'm basically what TERF-Idiots talk about when they mean that teens are just becoming non-binary for attention and *the trans* are tricking them into thinking that bla bla bla... 

Even though I absolutely think that TERFs are full of shit, I can't stop thinking ""But what if they're right about me?"" 

Rationally, I know that TERFs can suck ContraPoints off for all I care about them, but emotionally this made this whole thing harder.

**Part six: You decide!**

Well, I hope that should be all I wanted to rant about and I hope someone is still here. If you got any help or ideas how to help, please tell me. I've constantly been thinking I'm getting closer to the solution in the evenings, but feel always further away the next morning and I'm tired of feeling like that.

I want to apologize in advance for this annoyingly long post.

I’m 23 and AMAB, and I’ve been been identifying as non-binary for a few months now.  Mainly just in my own head, cause i havent really come out to anyone i know in real life yet, cause i have zero self esteem and i’m terrified what my friends and family will think.  Im also terrified that maybe im not really non-binary and im just faking it to make myself feel better about myself.

I dont think i “feel” male, but i dont necessarily feel female either (although sometimes i think i do).  I feel like my ideal body would be genderless and androgynous, with no reproductive organs.  

Back in high school, i remember sometimes secretly wanting to be female, but that was only some of the time; a lot of times i wouldnt care that i was male, or at least i didnt really think about it.  I would sometimes feel compelled to find ways to make myself look/feel more feminine, usually in small ways, like wearing womens’ jeans or wearing eyeliner.  I used to try on female clothing in secret sometimes.  I thought my body had a somewhat-feminine shape and was proud of that (really i was just fat, lmao).  I shaved my legs and body hair sometimes.  I tried to teach myself to have really feminine handwriting and secretly hoped that someone would mistake it for a girl’s handwriting...That probably sounds really stupid.  I went through a whole “emo” phase that, in retrospect, was somewhat just an excuse for me to try and make myself look more androgynous.  I sometimes secretly hoped someone would mistake me for a girl, but i also thought that was unrealistic.  

I was going through a bunch of stuff like that back then, but at the time, I kinda just wrote it off as “teenage hormones” and assumed everyone went through stuff like that.  I grew up/went to high school in a small, non-diverse town, do at the time, i didn’t know about non-binary identities, and i hardly knew anything about transgender either.  Im sorry for my bad grammar.  Its really late at night.  

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, in college was the first time i learned about non-binary identities and I immediately felt i identified with that. I experimented with identifying as agender for a while, but decided to drop it because I was experiencing serious self-doubt, and i had this extreme debilitating fear that i was just faking it for attention or something.  All my non-binary friends and classmates seemed so sure and so confident in their identities and they seemed like they had always known they were non-binary, and i felt like an impostor.  I went for the next like, five years after that convinced i was male, identified as male, went by he/him pronouns, etc.  i didnt really question my gender identity during that time, although in my mind, i sometimes considered myself “a genderless spirit in a male body” that felt comfortable identifying as male.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then a few months ago, i was sitting in my friend’s car, zoning out, and i completely randomly had the thought “I’m a woman.” and I felt like i’d had an epiphany.  It was the weirdest feeling and i can’t really describe it.  It was really intense.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, over the next few weeks, i steadily kept thinking about my gender identity more and more until i couldnt stop thinking about it.  I questioned for a couple weeks at first if i was mtf trans, but now i think its more likely that i’m genderfluid, or agender.  I’ve come to the realization that i really kinda hate having an uh... male part, and i wish i could get rid of it, and be completely genderless down there.  I sometimes wish my body was more feminine, but other times i just want to be androgynous.  I’ve realized i don’t necessarily like having a male voice, either

With all that being said, im still extremely afraid that maybe im just faking it to feel special or something.  Theres a bunch of stuff that just doesnt add up.  

\-I never really questioned my gender identity at all until around age 15.  

\-When i was a little kid, i mean line ages 3 to like 10, i actually had an extreme fear of being mistaken for a girl and would refuse to any clothes that i perceived as looking “feminine.”  This ended by age 10 or so, and as i said before, around age 15 was when the gender stuff really started for me.  

\-Ive never felt bothered by being referred to by male pronouns, although it equally wouldn’t bother me to be referred to by female pronouns.  I currently (mentally) refer to myself by they/them pronouns, but sometimes i still slip up and refer to myself as he/him

\-I had some weird daydream today about being old and having some boring office job and i was still male

\-sometimes i catch myself thinking about myself as a guy/a man

And a bunch of other stuff like that, probably, that i cant think of right now cause im half asleep and also i dont want to make an annoyingly long post which ive probably already done oops

I'm AMAB, I figured out I was trans roughly a year ago. It just dawned on me, I was absolutely certain, still am. A few months later I began to suspect that I might be nonbinary because saying ""I'm a girl"" felt awkward. First I thought I was just insecure or something, but later figured it must be more.

First I figured out I was nonbinary, later that my gender is not static, then I realized that I was agender ""at the core"", I just sometimes have gendered feelings.  
Found a neat label too: agenderflux. Later I figured I want to emphasize my agenderness, that feels mostly like me, those gendered feelings are just occasional and don't really feel like a part of me. So I identified as and viewed myself as agender.

I'm not sure if I got to the right conclusions. I feel like I can't test reliably what makes me feel comfortable and what doesn't.  
What should I try? More outfits, asking people online to try words on me? Can you ever really ""get there""? I want to solve the puzzle so bad.

The only thing I know for certain is that I'm ""female-aligned"" (I prefer lunarian).  
My gender doesn't have masc (solarian) parts.

2019-08-11 17:41:56,cozr4h,6,4,"Hey, so uh. This is my first post on reddit ever. I just heard about this community so I decided to come explore, and I'm realizing I would love some feedback from yall. 

I am AFAB, 21yrs, and I have known I was nonbinary/genderqueer for six or so years, but have done nothing about it besides dressing somewhat masculinely and gritting my teeth when gendered incorrectly or when I'm on my period. I avoided coming out because I feared for my career. I recently realized that I need to take more steps to be happy, though - publically using they/them pronouns, and maybe some medical steps as well, like hormones or breast reduction. 

However, I am terrified! All the info I see is for binary trans men, and my goal is to look very neutral. I am definitely not a man or a woman. There are some things about T that interest me, and other things that super scare me. I am also so incredibly done with my period, but I don't know what the best way is for me to deal with that, especially because right now I'm not in a position to get any surgery. I guess my question is, yall that are AFAB and trying to look neutral or vaguely masculine, what steps have any of yall taken? 

I have heard of microdosing T, but I don't have enough anecdotal evidence to decide if I want to pursue something like that. It freaks me out because I want a lower voice, a less curvy shape, etc, but I am scared of having a SUPER DEEP voice or growing a ton of facial hair! My friend Will is a trans man, and I watched his voice go from quite high to INCREDIBLY low. That would be too far for me! But I understand that T is a mixed bag and you don't pick what you get. Is it worth it? And also, I don't know if I want a breast reduction to like an A-cup, or a chest reconstruction! Aaaaaaa!

This is probably going to be long, so thanks if you’re reading this completely and if you don’t thank you anyways. 
Also slight warning to people triggered by anatomical terms and stuff like this.

I’m in my mid twenties, my body is female everything else is confusing. 
I always had issues with my gender but it took me a while to realize that they were issues. Took around 21 years to be exact. 
As a kid I didn’t really think about it, I saw myself as a boy. I was with the boys and I never thought about me being a girl. 
Issues arose when I leaned about anatomy. For a while - I’m not joking here - I thought that I’d grow a penis during puberty, so I didn’t worry about that. I kinda just waited patiently. 
Well surprise,surprise it didn’t happen. 
So instead in my youth I packed from time to time. Starting at age 13 I guess might have been a bit younger. 
I did it only in private and was extremely cautious about it so that no one would catch me doing it. It felt right. 

I always was into girls and by now I’m guessing that I didn’t see myself as a lesbian at the time because of gender issues. I basically had this realization one day that yes I am in fact homosexual, because I’m into the same gender/sex. 
So I came out at around 16.

The issues with not having grown that penis however stayed. They were more intense from time to time. Sometimes barely noticeable, sometimes really strong. 

It all came together when I was asked for my pronouns at an LGBTQ* get together on day and, for what felt like minutes, I stood there it didn’t know what to answer. 

My build is androgynous and I dress that way. Having people „misgender“ me fills me with immense joy. While on the other hand people addressing me as „Ms.“ or woman, sometimes even she/her is the opposite. It’s not horrible but it doesn’t feel good. 

I still pack in private from time to time and it feels so right. 
I don’t look in the mirror and feel intense dysphoria, instead by now it just feels like I managed to disconnect my mind from my body and go „That’s what it is.“. 


I don’t know why I am this way. I don’t know what to feel about it or who I am really. It’s confusing.
And I figured, that since I wouldn’t consider myself ftm that some anonymous people that know who they are in that regard, as in non binary, might be able to give advice.

This was a single occupancy restroom and I feel pretty safe using ones I know to be so as I could use the excuse that I didn't see the sign until after I walked out if anyone questions why I, because I look like a cis guy, was in the women's restroom. It's generally what I consider to be a low-risk move for the most part, especially if the particular place I am in is kinda not busy at the time I am in there. Also, single occupancy restrooms lock and I know I use the restroom the same as any other woman.

Now, I also pulled a rather bold (possibly read that as ""stupid"" or ""ridiculous"") move of [using a ""double occupancy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/ckwrsd/is_this_what_not_gaf_feels_like/) restroom (that is, two stalls, no locking door) at a relatively dead Chinese restaurant in town.

I only use them when the stall option is not there,"" and ""I'm tired of having to walk into the room with 'men' on the sign just to please others,"" and just went in, sat down, did my business, snapped an obligatory selfie, and walked out.

I'm AFAB, 23, but I don't really have a strong sense of gender identity one way or the other. I have short hair and I dress quite androgynously, but I don't experience any body dysphoria.

Because of my appearance some people, especially kids and older people, assume I'm male and use male pronouns. It's never occurred to me to correct them, and I have to say I enjoy seeing the confusion on people's faces. But likewise, my girlfriend, friends, family and most strangers for that matter refer to me as female, and I don't mind that either.

Since I don't feel any preference for one set of pronouns over the other and also don't feel the need to change the body I'm in, it feels like coming out as non-binary would be somewhat futile.

I'd be interested to know if any of you have had similar experiences!

Hey enby friends. I'm pretty new to this whole thing and feeling terrified. I've been supportive of friends and strangers in being themselves and have been happy to help others feel valid in themselves, but since realizing my enby-ness, I'm having trouble applying the same to myself. It's strange for me to realize that I go beyond gender nonconforming and that there's a reason I've never liked the word ""woman"" as applied to myself and have disliked my top half so intensely. Letting myself out of a binary box feels scary and puts me on uneven ground, even if it helps me understand why my body has always felt like just a vessel that doesn't fit my spirit. 

I grew up in a conservative Christian home - pushed down and internally berated any part of me that wasn't cishet for a long, long time.

Got there (having informed them on beforehand that I have tons of hair and wanna cut it into some short, androgynous look) and the dude who was going to cut it refused to. He said it would take way too long and I would end up looking like a boy (oh the horrors) and that all my reference photos of cool looking folks with short hair would never work on me (I have straight hair and a lot of it).

People in general recoil in horror when I tell them I want to cut it short, like really, what is the deal with long hair? Is that where my life force unbeknowst to me recides? Will I die if they cut it? I am of course all stressed out about it now, as it was a huge decision to begin with, and being met with that attitude I dunno if cutting it is a flat out bad idea. I did the same thing and chopped my long hair off when I was 15 and kept it short until my late teenage years, but back then I was 1. constantly broke and 2. had a dubious sense of style, which more often than not resulted in me cutting it myself with a razor and bleaching it until it looked and felt like bubblegum etc. I was hoping being 33 and somewhat slightly more on top of my shit would result in a better look, but what if I'm wrong?

I don't know if what I experience is neccesarily dysphoria, but I really would want a cool, nice looking boyish haircut to present more gender neutral.

So I told her honestly “well no, I prefer they/them, and while I do consider myself trans, I want to be androgynous more than anything. That’s when I feel happiest with my body.”

She said she could kind of understand because for a long long time she was forced to be one religion while she truly believed she should be apart of another. She said she didn’t get it fully but if it was at all like her experience, then it made sense to her.

I told her I would like to see a therapist to talk about it, and to possible start T, and maybe even get top surgery, and she was so accepting?? It was amazing!

I’m just.. blown away. In the past she has made not kind comments about trans people, and the fact the she is devoutly religious has also made me nervous to speak about my non-binary-ness anymore than I already (when I 15-16, I told her of it and she immediately called me an “it”)..

2019-08-13 06:47:47,cppcsn,7,12,"Hi all, 

I think I'm mostly just looking for some support and to see if my story is similar to that of anyone else. 

I'm AFAB, in my 30s, and on the asexual spectrum, which I've known since I was a teenager although I didn't know there was a word for it until a few years ago. My ""style"" has bounced around a lot. I had a ""tomboy"" phase, a punk/goth phase, and since college, it's basically been jeans and t-shirts when not at work (which required a uniform). 

Anyways, I've always been big on feminism and equitable treatment, and over the years found myself getting more and more annoyed with just how unnecessarily gendered absolutely *everything* is and also uncomfortable with all this gendered stuff being applied to me. 

At some point during the last couple of years, I became aware of what nonbinary was and every few months would read a bunch about it. I found myself making an effort to use more and more neutral language, and also have found myself getting even more upset/uncomfortable with gendered language (and especially gendered insults). I really want to try using they/them pronouns and see how it feels. 

However, I'm okay with my gendered name, and I don't have any dysphoria in regards to my body (I mean...I wish some things were different, but that has to do with weight, not gender). I also like wearing makeup and I like my long hair, although I think it would be fun to mix up my professional wardrobe to incorporate more of a blend of styles (Billy Porter's tuxdress *spoke to me*). 

I'm also having a really hard time finding a nonbinary word that describes how I feel. I've been spending a lot of time on the nonbinary wiki and ""fuck it"" doesn't seem to be listed as a gender. Is enby as like a nebulous non-specific third gender considered a valid gender identity?

2019-08-13 08:33:36,cpq98m,1,29,"So I've decided to change my name to Venera. I've been trying find a name for myself that truly communicates who and what I am(Demiguy here). I was born (AMAB) on a Friday, the supposed day of the goddesses of queerness, sensuality, love, romance, art and magic. Goddesses such as Ezili Freda,Venus, Freya, Oshun, and more. 


Having this mythological appreciation for the day of my birth helped me make sense of my identity before I had the vocab to communicate who and what I am. It may seem weird but mythology served as a stand in for the absence of that vital language. Even now I find my nature better accounted for in the Nonbinary myths of deities such as Hermaphroditus. 


I was always considered feminine growing up, too ""empathetic"" and have always been a deeply sensual person with a love for poetry, and the subtleties of nature and life. Unfortunately my dad impulsively stamped his first name on me and I've been trying to find my true name ever since. Venera seems to come closest to that. In fact just saying it stirs up a genuine sense of joy. 


I am quite nervous about asking people to call me by new name, though. More specifically my family members. But the more I think about it the more I realise what I actually fear is being an inconvenience. That's no way to live. 


So I'm going set a day to come forward about my decision. I feel as though by summoning the courage to tell others, I'll be more committed to the legal process of changing my name among other things. I just wanted to share this with all of you amazing Enbies gently and fiercely trying to embody the experience you deserve. 🌹

2019-08-14 06:19:57,cq5qu2,0,1,"Beware wall of text.

First of all, hey all! I'm new to this sub but from what I've seen I already feel a bit comfortable talking about this in here. Also, my username is garbage and often associated with bigotry but I assure you it doesn't represent me, when I created it I didn't fully know it was associated with a intolerance. I wish I could change it but I'll probably end up deleting this account and creating another one.

I consult regularly with a psychiatrist because I have OCD, clinical depression and have recently been diagnosed with DID, which at first was suspected to be Schizophrenia because of some behavior patterns – I don't know how to explain the details but anyway. 

So, with that said I believe it's clear that there's some confusion in my mind. And that's not even half of it. Here comes the gender part: I don't really know how to describe myself. And my therapist won't be really helpful when it comes to gender identities because he said that's not his area of expertise. He said he could look into it and recommend me another psychiatrist but since he's been really helpful with everything else I refused for now.

For years I thought I was non-binary because I don't really mind being called a man or a woman. I dress, wear accessories and style my hair the way I like. Most of the time I'm very comfortable with having a penis, not having a vagina or breasts. But sometimes – I think this is where DID comes into – these things do bother me.

At first I thought I was just a cis boy with the curiosity of being a girl for a day to see what it feels like. That was years ago. As the years passed I started noticing that I've always been a mix of masculinity and femininity, since I was a child. Being bullied at school for doing some things deemed ""too feminine"" – and also because I'm bi/pan –, I started repressing this part of me but in my later teenage years I started not giving a damn about what others thought.

I then started viewing myself as a somewhat feminine man. But that wasn't true. Years later I found out about descriptions such as non-binary and it made much more sense than what I was thinking so far, yet I can't help but feel that's still not exactly what happens with my gender.

As I've expressed before, most of the time I'm really comfortable simply thinking of myself as a non-binary person who's often called a man with he/him pronouns and not feeling bad when I'm called a woman with she/her pronouns – even when it's meant to be derogatory – nor feeling bad about my genitals and stuff. But sometimes – it might sound really strange to some – I feel like a whole woman that's mostly attracted to women. And then I feel my penis and I start to feel uncomfortable for a while.

I don't know exactly how many personalities I have but these two are the easiest ones to identify: the non-binary person who might be a bit more inclined towards the male part of the spectrum and doesn't care about their genders, and the probably trans woman who experiences discomfort with her body, especially genitals.

I believe this might be trickier to understand than simply saying ""hey you're a lesbian trans girl"" or ""you're a bi/pan non-binary person"" because I have at least two distinct personalities. I'm aware of them most of the time and they might overlap, but sometimes I can't remember precisely what happened or how I was feeling.

If I had to be precise in saying when my second most common personality – the lesbian chick, that's how I usually refer to her – has clearly manifested itself I would guess it was in my early teens because of some memories I have, especially from what people told me. I was abused by a \~15 year old girl when I was 8 and this is probably when this personality first started to develop. I know, it sucks but really the abuse part is not an issue in my life anymore, I have learned to understand and accept it long ago to the point where I can proudly say I'm not ashamed of it – it used to make me extremely embarrassed when I talked about it and now it doesn't have a negative impact on me.

So there are a few questions that I would REALLY appreciate having an answer to. I'm currently looking for any help really, because I haven't found any similar story and am feeling lost and alone when it comes to it. I just ask you to please say if that's simply your opinion, if it's an educated guess or if you really know what you're talking about – sources would be nice but not needed. Here are most of the questions that currently bother me:

1. The ""main"" personality is what I've always felt as the ""real me"". I still call myself by my name given at birth when this one is taking over. But when the other personality starts to randomly show up I feel bad when I hear people call me by this name. Should I give her a name or something? Would this mess up even further or would it help me organize a little? I have thought about it but never really decided anything, the names Angela and Emilia came to mind and I have no clue why. My male name could easily be converted to female but for some reason I thought of these two.
2. How do I get people to understand this situation as quickly as possible? I mean, clearly I myself can't quite understand it and it's taking me a long time to explain what I know about it so far, so how do I come to make sure people will understand a bit of what's going on with my mind, gender and sexuality when this whole thing is becoming a huge chaos when I keep thinking and studying about it?
3. The lesbian chick is somewhat aggressive at times – really different from what my behavior is most of the time –, and can be mean to people I love like my mother, sister or my close friends. Sometimes I'm aware of it and I keep thinking ""apologize now, apologize right now, say you didn't mean it"" but I just can't or the apology only comes a few moments after when my main personality starts to assume ""control"". Sometimes I only know what I did wrong when someone tells me or reminds me of it. Is there a way I can mitigate this aggressive behavior and make all of my personalities AT LEAST have kindness in common?
4. How the hell should I present myself? Both IRL and online.
5. Is there anything I can do to try and help myself instead of always depending on a psychiatrist? If anyone who's a professional and works with cases like these could give me insight about this question that would be even better.

For the most part I'm actually okay with that! If someone has a direct question like... ""how did you know you were non-binary?"" or ""where can you buy a good binder"" or something along those lines, I'm often happy to answer but people ask th'vaguest shit and then get annoyed at me for not giving them answer to their broad musings.

Example being - someone just gave my name to a complete stranger on facebook and said I'd be a person to talk to about non-binary issues (?!). They've just found out their relative is genderqueer so they want advice on when they meet them and info to bring to the genderqueer person. 

Advice on WHAT?! Info on WHAT?! Does the genderqueer person even NEED any info? I asked for clarification (in a nice, non ""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!"" way that I'm describing here) and they seem taken aback by the fact I didn't just... info dump on them and asked for specifics.

They're most likely just very new to the notion of non-binary folk and they're looking for reassurance and hints and tips but it's so broad it's like asking ""how do I talk to humans and how do I help them with all their problems?"" when everyone is different, even if they have the common thread of not being binary. I feel like an absolute arsehole for not having answers for everyone and I don't know how I'm supposed to approach vague help requests :(

We discuss pretty extensively about gender, social politics, capitalism, etc. and yesterday we came to a disagreement regarding gender.

His dysphoria from my understanding revolves around not being comfortable with his chest. He says his dysphoria is not too bad but he is considering a reduction. However, he feels like he will always be misgendered for having breasts, he does not want to medically transition, or top surgery, because he feels like doing so is counterproductive to tearing down gender and social constructs. He feels western beauty standards are essentially tied to white supremacy and gender is essentially tied to the patriarchy. He thinks transitioning is not natural, and thinks everybody would just be comfortable with their bodies if it weren't for the power dynamics that exist in the external capitalist framework. I wanted to respond by saying that I love him and understand where he's coming from, but gender is not JUST a social construct. Unfortunately, before I could say anything, he shut me off and told me not to touch him. 

I medically transitioned specifically because I KNOW and have known since my earliest memory that the neurological representation of my own body is binary female, but now I'm starting to feel like I'll always be inferior to cis women in his eyes because he thinks I'm doing this to navigate around the patriarchal definition of gender instead of fighting the system from within. I agree completely with the analysis of the situation he is in, but I don't think I have to be thrown under the bus like this. I still hold myself 100% accountable for all the privileges I had when I was pre-transition, and to some extent I still feel accountable for the current patriarchal structure, but I feel like at this point all I'm trying to do is stay alive. 

He's a rad feminist and has gotten skeptical at me before because I suggested I might want bottom surgery and I do complain my body dysphoria very often, but he doesn't think there's anything wrong with my body. Which is sweet, but it's not the point and just ughhhhhh I don't know what to say because even before we both came out, he would constantly yell at me over arbitrary things I did, that made me a ""man"".

*Hello,   I am AFAB NB and currently in the process of transitioning. I am   wondering if it's bad to go back on the name you thought you wanted? I   started testing a new name to see if it fit me. It was a gender neutral   nick name from my childhood which I thought would work because a lot of   trans influencers seem to pick symbolic names like that.

I   have commitment issues and I think that is making me wig out about   finding a new name, but I know I need one because whenever people call   me the name given to me by my parents I get sad. Whenever people call me   the name I am trying out with some friends I get bummed out too!*

*I   have started just having people call me by my last name in anonymous   situations like at coffee shops and it is like lifeblood to be referred   to as because I have one of those weird last names that is also a name   (masculine). It feels really good to be called it. I am worried the  same  thing will happen with my last name though because lol it's my  dad's last name and I was the only one who had his name in my family and he  was  really abusive. So it's kind of weird in that it's an identifier  for me  but it feels good, but I am worried it won't down the road....*

*I   have this other name that I am thinking about that is more an isolated   thing that I am really not sure about either. It's just so different   than anything and I am worried it will be something I regret too. It   feels good sometimes but more than anything it feels really different.*

*I   guess what I am wondering is if it is bad to test out names before   committing to one? Or is that really frowned upon?

Insofar as teaching myself that being sexually assaulted wasn't my fault (something I sort of grasp now), learning that I didn't do anything wrong to cause it, and learning that just an AFAB person sexually assaulting an AMAB person isn't *lesser.*

But there's a lot of stuff from that relationship that really bothers me now, mostly in that I still get treated as a guy by other NB people or GNC people. When my partner would hit me it would somehow become my fault for retaliating at all, and when he'd yell at me it would somehow be my fault for yelling back too. A lot of it just reminds me of my life as a cis guy.

I don't really ""present"" in a way. I dress for comfort and practicability, I dress in what makes me happy, and I feel like because of that people treat me as some kind of fake and I'm starting to internalise a lot of that. I've been openly agender for 4 years now, though.

The idea of someone touching me romantically (even just a kiss on the cheek, a shoulder squeeze or my date accidentally brushing my arm) made me extremely anxious and embarrassed and almost physically sick, so I’d make up excuses in my head:
-I’m saving myself for marriage
-I’m on the aro/ace spectrum
-I have haphephobia
-My haphephobia is set off by romantic touches

For an even longer time, I questioned my gender.

After a few years (in which I developed bad depression, social anxiety and was close to being diagnosed with OCD), I finally accidentally outed myself when I was explaining what MtF transgender means to my family. When I came out, it was almost like I got permission to be myself (at home, at least) from my brain. Btw, my family is super accepting - though sometimes still misgenders me, but I know they’re trying, and my brother has promised to ‘teach me the way of the boy’ on my more masculine days :D

After coming out and getting permission from myself, the idea of kissing someone didn’t seem so repulsive and I didn’t feel physically sick when I imagined someone wrapping their arms around me and whispering “I love you, [newname].”

I realise that I’d mislabelled my dysphoria as ‘haphephobia’ for a few years (though I probably have a small amount of it, tbh).

2019-08-16 16:40:28,cr8xq0,4,9,"Hello, I'm like 95% sure I'm nonbinary (they/them, 21), and assigned female at birth. I'm mostly closeted outside a tight network of friends. I've been feeling really dysphoric lately, but the problem is... I'm not sure what I want to achieve with transitioning. 

There's things about my body I love: I have a voice that sounds relatively masculine but higher pitch. I've been told when I talk I sound more like the stereotypical ""gay lisp"" than a cis girl. My legs are relatively ""gender neutral"" looking. I have a perky butt and defined legs and I don't shave all the time so they kinda pass as ""vaguely masculine."" I'm mostly okay with my face. 

However, there are other things I'm dysphoric about. Even though I do love my voice, I know my pitch is just high enough to where it clocks me as female 100% of the time. I am really dysphoric about my chest, and I have purposefully been wearing sports bras and not showering for days without changing my bras so I don't have to see it. I'm 5'4, so i'd be excessively short for a man if I were to transition completely. I have small shoulders for a cis man, but average shoulders for a cis woman. Thankfully, I've been less dysphoric about my shoulders since I started working out. I don't feel excessively dysphoric about my face, but I've had some people tell me it looks masc because of my jawline, but feminine because of the cheekbones. 

Overall, I am ALWAYS gendered as female. Even when I wear unisex T-shirts, sweatpants, skinny jeans, converse, flip flops, etc. It sucks. I can never be seen as male. 

But I don't necessarily want to be a man? When I imagine myself as a man, my version of it is a skinny, stereotypically bisexual rockstar. I would have long hair, and wear makeup, and be tall and thin and vaguely muscular. I wouldn't have much body hair. I would be taller. My voice would be deeper. I can imagine if I were assigned male at birth, I would be the type to look ""early transfemme"" (long hair, makeup, painted nails, etc.) I'd look like a man that can easily be confused for a tall woman. 

T can't help me with this image. It can't make me grow a foot taller, or ultimately change my bone structure, or control the exact things I want to control. The thought of me having bottom-growth and body hair makes me feel gross. Part of me wants top surgery in the far future (I say that because my family is  transphobic and I'd rather bind than come out to them right now), but when I see other people's post-top surgery photos, I see gross scarring and black nipple grafts. I can see myself having horrible post-surgery blues upon getting it. But if I ever had breast cancer, I know I'd jump on a double mastectomy before you can say radiation. 

I guess at the end of the day, I just want to pass as either binary gender. I want to be gendered as male sometimes by total strangers or people who first meet me.

So, there is a dumb ""controversy"" regarding a character (not sure if I use plural here, sorry if I am mistaken in using singular) from the upcoming game Borderlands 3 which was """"revealed"""" (all their promo material was in accordance to this, but it did not stop bigots from claiming otherwise) to be non-binary. I found it nice because it was the character I was already going to use in the game, and it is neat to play as my first non-binary character ever in a videogame. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the wake of this, I thought how nice it is that two of my favorite characters in art are non-bi, the other being Taylor Masonfrom the show ""Billions"". I also came to a realization that it is about time to not mess up the pronouns anymore when it comes to then, and also that the issues they face can be really interesting from a storytelling point of view. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is why I wanted to hear what non-binary characters from all forms of art you do enjoy, be it in movies, games, comics, books etc, because simply reading the rules do not stick it to my brain cause I always had a hard time with grammar overall, and learned it out of practice instead of memorizing it. Since I am also a sucker for art in general and a wannabee writer, I am also interested in character variety, and that, of course, also applies to gender identity.

&amp;#x200B;

As a last note, I am truly sorry if I mistook the pronoun usage (would appreciate corrections if that was the case), and I could have posted this in other subreddits but I wanted to get the opinions of non-binary people specifically.

2019-08-17 04:10:30,crhck8,7,18,"Story time!

I spent a long time feeling really lost on how I wanted to present. As a nonbinary person with a neutral gender, I can't really ""pass"" as my gender the way a binary trans person might be able to. I loved feminine clothes, always have, but I am AFAB and felt like my appearance made me look both cis and straight. I didn't WANT that, I wanted to look ""gay"", but I wasn't sure how or in what way. 

And then I got my hair cut short again, after having it shoulder length for a long time. At first I was worried, because I realized the haircut looked really masculine/butch, more so than I had expected, and I was afraid the look would ""clash"" with my feminine clothes. But after a couple weeks of thinking, I realized that's exactly what I wanted! To mix and match gender! Masculine aspects and feminine aspects, all rolled into one.

I started combining feminine elements like dresses, pretty jewelry &amp; accessories, and my already feminine face, with more masculine things like visible body hair, my very short haircut, no makeup, and masculine looking jewelry and accessories - all mixed together in each outfit I wear. I've also been binding on some days and not binding on others, for some variety. 

This style really suits me and I've been feeling more confident and comfortable in my gender than I have in a long time! I definitely look gay af now, and I enjoy how confusing I must look to all the cisgenders (haha). I feel gender noncomforming in all sorts of ways and I love it.

To all of you who read my story, thank you! This is actually my first time posting on this subreddit; I don't know why but I just felt like sharing today. :)

(throwaway for obvious reasons - half of this is a rant but feel free to comment on whatever)

I recently came to terms with the fact I am most probably non-binary. I've been very comfortable being masc my entire life, however, recently I've had the opportunity to explore presenting in a less-than-masc way, and I've found it extremely comforting and empowering. Also, I asked a few of my friends to use they/them when referring to me, and it has been absolutely incredibly empowering.

I'm torn however, because I feel like I'm not ""femme-enough"" in action/presentation to even consider myself to be non-binary, and thanks to the wonderful gift(?) of testosterone, I have a very masc body (lots of upper torso hair i'm not too fond of, and some leg hair I'm absolutely chill with). On the other hand, however, I would love to wear a cute af crop-top (or tee shirt) and a skirt out and about. (I'm also not too wild on growing out my hair a lot because that's a lot to take care of, and I don't think I have time to do it). 

So, I dunno. Is anyone else here more of a masc amab person, and is that even a thing? Do any of y'all have tips on dressing more femme (especially when you have body image issues as it is)? Any tips or resources to understanding this whole thing as I start out figuring out who I am would really be amazing.

Also, I asked a few of my friends to use they/them when referring to me, and it has been absolutely incredibly empowering.\n\nI\'m torn however, because I feel like I\'m not ""femme-enough"" in action/presentation to even consider myself to be non-binary, and thanks to the wonderful gift(?) of testosterone, I have a very masc body (lots of upper torso hair i\'m not too fond of, and some leg hair I\'m absolutely chill with). On the other hand, however, I would love to wear a cute af crop-top (or tee shirt) and a skirt out and about. (I\'m also not too wild on growing out my hair a lot because that\'s a lot to take care of, and I don\'t think I have time to do it). \n\nSo, I dunno. Is anyone else here more of a masc amab person, and is that even a thing? Do any of y\'all have tips on dressing more femme (especially when you have body image issues as it is)? Any tips or resources to understanding this whole thing as I start out figuring out who I am would really be amazing.

- it was really good! He is friendly, professional, knows what he’s talking about. He didn’t ask me anything I found instrusive (I felt quite well prepared by other people’s Reddit posts and a friend who went)
- he totally respected non binary identity :D I didn’t feel I had to pretend to be more masc or more binary than I am at all (I am femme trans masc/non binary. I don’t know at this point how far I want to go with physical masculinisation but I am pretty sure I want most of the changes that will come in the first few months of T at least)
- if my bloods are okay and GP agrees, I can go on low dose T. He suggested a gel which I wasn’t keen on initially but it allows you to control the dose and get a more stable T level, which I think will be better for me than injections to start with.
- I am 31 and have spent some time seeing a therapist and getting my life relatively stable, I think this helped as firstly a lot of his questions are around what support you have in place, and also having already worked through things allowed me to stay calm and felt like I knew the answers during the assessment
- I am out and have changed name socially but not on ID or by deedpoll yet, he was fine with that but suggested deedpoll as a next step
- I paid privately for the appointment with him, hopefully (!!) will get blood tests and prescription via GP but I might have to pay for first prescription. In 6 months if I am still on T I need to see an endocrinologist (Dr Seal or Dr Coxon) which is another cost. Nb people are sometimes required to have a second opinion from one of the other Gendercare doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there,

A lot has changed for me in the past year. After four-ish years living as a binary trans woman (having bottom surgery too), I decided to open up to my nonbinary side and use they/them pronouns in the spring. Which has been so positive and so powerful! For lots of reasons! I feel like my transition(s), such that they are, have been about finding my way back to a sense of belonging/home/safety in my body, in my way of relating to others, in my expressiveness, and especially with what I want to \*do\* with myself and my life.

And now that I'm a little deeper into nonbinary life, I am figuring out what making a home in nonbinary-ness truly means for me. I'm figuring it out as I go - shaved my head, switched over to minimal/sports bras under collared shirts, let my voice drop a bit, etc. - and though I'm not like adopting classic like stone butch style, I am really enjoying finding softness in the context of a queer-coded-mascness (e.g. bright lipstick but with sharp collared top and clothes). However, there are a few things that I am still sort of out to sea about, and it would be helpful to hear any thoughts you have:

1. Chest dysphoria. I never really enjoyed the new experience of having breasts, and more recently realized that I also don't really want them touched. I think I would strongly consider, in the medium future, top surgery. They are pretty modestly sized or whatever (small side of B if that). But I'm actually not sure - can I have top surgery and stay on E (I no longer take progsterone, and I don't need andro blockers post-surgery)? Would there continue to be breast tissue regrowth? What if I waited until the equivalent of a cis puberty cycle, so another two or three years?

2. Hormones generally. I really like mentally being on E, I like having a female body/softness/smell with a nonbinary masc-ish presentation. That all works for me. But are there any benefits or options for more nonbinary hormone combinations? I'm less familiar with this all. I could never grow much facial hair, and I've done laser and plucked a lot in the past, so that all wouldn't come back, which is kind of ironic as I wouldn't mind it at all at this point.

3. Dating. What should I expect? Any tips/ideas? I am attracted to folks across genders and presentations, although recent experience definitely suggests that I'd be very happy dating a more femme partner, especially trans women. I worry about somebody not seeing me for the nonbinary queer that I am, so I guess like communication is a bit stressful in that way if that makes sense. Also, I am not unilaterally like a butch stereotype by ANY means, and I'm a softy and weirdo in my way too. I am excited to date as like, more of a (service) top, and express that confidence and care in various ways, fwiw :p

2019-08-20 18:25:11,ct3l25,3,13,"I was going to write this eloquently, but I changed my mind, deciding to address the nitty gritty directly. 

Yes I lost a romantic relationship with my decision to start HRT. It pales in comparison to the loss of the relationship I had lost with myself and my body; as the years progressed and the body and social dysphoria mounted higher my lifeboat quickly sunk with the never ceasing onslaught of flood water. 

Within eight hours of my first shot on 2/21 the painful parts began to evaporate. I cried more happy tears than I ever have in my life. 

Since then I can decided what to eat, for the most part the depression has vanished. At times the PTSD related dissociation and flashbacks have amplified but I have been assured by my therapist and multiple trans folks this eases in a few months.  My emotional range has diminished but it beats hyper emotionality which gave me even more dysphoria. My sleep quality has greatly improved in general, but I still have spoon limits with fatigue.

(I searched the archive before posting, but just when I thought I had my answer, I found myself further confused.)

Yesterday I was summarizing a new york Times article for my 11 year old son (he still identified as a boy at the time) about the older members of his generation (teenagers, early 20s) transcending gender. What I picked up from the article, and what I tried to tell him, is that there are lots of people who don't feel like a boy or a girl so they call themselves non binary. But there are also people who identify as non binary because they don't believe gender to be an either/or. These people never felt particularly conflicted with how society gendered them, but they use the label to promote the idea that everyone has both ""traditionally masc"" and ""traditionally fem"" traits. My kid responded to this second part by declaring themself to be nb. I asked about pronouns and their answer was they/ them... After a pause they added that I should use ""he/him"" when talking to their dad (my asshole ex who strives to be as ""normal"" as possible) or anyone who knows my kid. They were at their dads house today and started texting me questions like whether LGBTQ+ includes nb and what is gender queer. I tried to answer by talking about the difference between gender and attraction, but ultimately asked to postpone the conversation till tomorrow when we can have it in person. 

I don't believe my kid has ever felt conflicted about gender. In the past they've gotten a pedicure with me and for a year or two said pink was their favorite color. However, I believe that came from a place of wanting to rebel against society (or possibly against their dad), because I have the same trait of wanting to go against people who just want to keep up appearances.

So what did I mess up? I'm sure I could have done better but I'm fairly new to understanding the concept of non binary.

Tldr: I'm scared I gave my kid bad info when I explained that some enbys have never felt dysphoric about gender. Now my kid says they are enby. Fine with me, but what if they are basing their identity on my misunderstanding of this stuff???  Please correct me so I don't cause them any unnecessary grief.

2019-08-21 01:30:40,ct9rcp,3,14,"Hello everyone,

I am 33 years old, and camab. Over the past few months, I have come to accept and understand myself as non-binary, and I would like to ask for some help, any help, with regard to my dysphoria, but before I get to that, I'd like to give a little background and explain why it took 33 years for not only to come to terms with it all, but to even conceptualize it in the first place.

So from a very young age, I have felt very different, but I always had trouble telling what exactly it was about me that made me feel so different. I had essentially all the privileges: white, ""male"", intelligent, comfortable socioeconomic status. I could never understand why I felt so off, I was never bullied at school or in my neighborhood, and I had supportive and well-meaning parents. I latched on to various groups, always being accepted but never really feeling like I fit in anywhere. I tried the geeks, I tried the stoners, none of it worked. After I started working, I met a lot of LGBT people, and began to wonder if I fit in with them. I felt a very tight bond with them, but this made no sense to me, because I had always been romantically and sexually attracted to women. So, eventually I gave up on that community, as I had so many others before.

Growing up, I never had a problem making friends, but I had a lot of difficulty with romantic relationships. I came up with a million rationalizations, that I was shy, that I was unlucky, that I was too picky, but suffice it to say that things happened at a rather slow pace. My first kiss was at 20, and I had sex for the first time at 25. A few years ago, however, I met my ex, and the first year of the relationship was absolutely wonderful. Her friends were almost all LGBT, and I felt really in my skin with all of them. This was when I was really introduced to ideas of gender, feminism, and so on. However, discussion still mostly focused on binaries, and after some time the relationship began to erode. Things got complicated emotionally, and because of this I began to unconsciously avoid sex, and to go through erectile dysfunction an uncomfortable number of times. A lot of questions were ~~shouted~~ asked about who was attracted to which gender, and so on. Eventually, we broke up, and I won't go through all the drama, but the core reason why the relationship didn't work was that we both wanted to occupy the same space in the relationship, the typically-female space.

Obviously, this made me even more confused. How can someone want to occupy a female space in a relationship, but a male space in sex? How can someone want to be pampered and told they're beautiful, but find no pleasure in being penetrated during sex? Fortunately, after a hefty dose of Drag Race and Queer Eye, and thanks to an absolutely amazing therapist, the cognitive dissonance subsided, I came to understand that I am in fact non-binary and that there is a Q after LGBT and that it's not just for Miley Cyrus. I finally came out to my sister last Sunday.

The reason that it took me so long to figure this all out is that I didn't even know it was possible to be who I am, an amab non-binary who is attracted to women (or as my sister put it, a lesbian who took a wrong turn before being born). Now my whole life makes sense to me, and though I still have a lot to figure out in terms of expressing myself and how I present, I finally feel like I can shed my ""shadow cloak"" and be beautiful and fabulous. And this brings me to the issue at hand, which is my dysphoria.

From the neck down, I have absolutely no problem with my body. I'm totally fine with my penis, and my legs are like my best feature. My body hair doesn't bother me, and I don't feel any need to have breasts or a vagina. From the neck up, however, things get a little complicated. My facial hair is fine, in the sense that I can just grow it or shave it as I see fit. The big deal is my hair, or lack thereof. You see, I come from a long line of bald men, and by the time I turned 18, things started to go downhill fast, and when I was around 22 or 23 I had the full Franciscan monk look, as my grandmother likes to say.

Until I was 17, I was frankly gorg. Of course, I couldn't see myself as pretty, because I was a ""man"", but the point is I felt fine with my looks. But as the baldness started setting in, I started to feel more and more dysphoric (although obviously at the time I didn't have a word for it, just a very persistent feeling). And it was odd, because I didn't think it made me look ugly or anything, just...weird. Not me. Now I get that it's because it makes me look waaaay more masculine that I would care for, and it's driving me kind of nuts. Although people do many different things when they want to present masculine, few things are as male-associated as (natural) baldness. Even medically: the hair usually falls off due to high levels of testosterone.

But I am not male, and I don't want to present male. What I don't know, however, is how to deal with it. I am unable to shave off my beard, even though I would like to, because if I did I would look either like a giant baby or a skinhead. I'm also very reluctant about wearing wigs or hats because heating up my head is guaranteed to trigger a migraine. I'm even reluctant to wear more fem clothing because it would cause such a massive case of dissonance with my bald head. Further, I tried finasteride when I was younger, but it did absolutely nothing, and I don't intend to go on HRT for the foreseeable future. Which leaves me with a grand total of one option: freaking out because I wish so, so bad that I had the same beautiful, gorgeous, flowy hair that I had when I was 17, and all I see when I look in the mirror is a stranger.

If you've stuck with me for this long, thank you, truly. Just being listened to is so important for me. If you, however, have some advice for how to deal with this, I would really, really appreciate it. There's something that all the gender-neutral clothes, piercings, jewelry and make-up in the world can't make up for, and I don't know what to do about it. I'm going to an LGBTQ-friendly barber in a couple of weeks, and she's going to do what she can to demasculinize my face, but if anyone out there has a tip, or a recommendation, or knows about someone who talks about these issues, that would be incredible. But even if all you can offer is a word of encouragement, believe me, it's worth its weight in gold.

Thank you. You are all beautiful  ❤️",NonBinary,Baldness and dysphoria,1566376240.0,"{'created_utc': 1566351040, 'id': 'ct9rcp', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 14, 'selftext': 'Hello everyone,\n\nI am 33 years old, and camab. Over the past few months, I have come to accept and understand myself as non-binary, and I would like to ask for some help, any help, with regard to my dysphoria, but before I get to that, I\'d like to give a little background and explain why it took 33 years for not only to come to terms with it all, but to even conceptualize it in the first place.\n\nSo from a very young age, I have felt very different, but I always had trouble telling what exactly it was about me that made me feel so different. I had essentially all the privileges: white, ""male"", intelligent, comfortable socioeconomic status. I could never understand why I felt so off, I was never bullied at school or in my neighborhood, and I had supportive and well-meaning parents. I latched on to various groups, always being accepted but never really feeling like I fit in anywhere. I tried the geeks, I tried the stoners, none of it worked. After I started working, I met a lot of LGBT people, and began to wonder if I fit in with them. I felt a very tight bond with them, but this made no sense to me, because I had always been romantically and sexually attracted to women. So, eventually I gave up on that community, as I had so many others before.\n\nGrowing up, I never had a problem making friends, but I had a lot of difficulty with romantic relationships. I came up with a million rationalizations, that I was shy, that I was unlucky, that I was too picky, but suffice it to say that things happened at a rather slow pace. My first kiss was at 20, and I had sex for the first time at 25. A few years ago, however, I met my ex, and the first year of the relationship was absolutely wonderful. Her friends were almost all LGBT, and I felt really in my skin with all of them. This was when I was really introduced to ideas of gender, feminism, and so on. However, discussion still mostly focused on binaries, and after some time the relationship began to erode. Things got complicated emotionally, and because of this I began to unconsciously avoid sex, and to go through erectile dysfunction an uncomfortable number of times. A lot of questions were ~~shouted~~ asked about who was attracted to which gender, and so on. Eventually, we broke up, and I won\'t go through all the drama, but the core reason why the relationship didn\'t work was that we both wanted to occupy the same space in the relationship, the typically-female space.\n\nObviously, this made me even more confused. How can someone want to occupy a female space in a relationship, but a male space in sex? How can someone want to be pampered and told they\'re beautiful, but find no pleasure in being penetrated during sex? Fortunately, after a hefty dose of Drag Race and Queer Eye, and thanks to an absolutely amazing therapist, the cognitive dissonance subsided, I came to understand that I am in fact non-binary and that there is a Q after LGBT and that it\'s not just for Miley Cyrus. I finally came out to my sister last Sunday.\n\nThe reason that it took me so long to figure this all out is that I didn\'t even know it was possible to be who I am, an amab non-binary who is attracted to women (or as my sister put it, a lesbian who took a wrong turn before being born). Now my whole life makes sense to me, and though I still have a lot to figure out in terms of expressing myself and how I present, I finally feel like I can shed my ""shadow cloak"" and be beautiful and fabulous. And this brings me to the issue at hand, which is my dysphoria.\n\nFrom the neck down, I have absolutely no problem with my body. I\'m totally fine with my penis, and my legs are like my best feature. My body hair doesn\'t bother me, and I don\'t feel any need to have breasts or a vagina. From the neck up, however, things get a little complicated. My facial hair is fine, in the sense that I can just grow it or shave it as I see fit. The big deal is my hair, or lack thereof. You see, I come from a long line of bald men, and by the time I turned 18, things started to go downhill fast, and when I was around 22 or 23 I had the full Franciscan monk look, as my grandmother likes to say.\n\nUntil I was 17, I was frankly gorg.

To start off, I'm perfectly fine with people calling me ""she/her."" That feels like part of my identity. Whenever someone misgenders me and calls me ""he/him,"" though, I get very happy. Although it's awkward, I also like when people have to ask me whether I'm a boy or a girl. The only dysphoria I've had in my life was about my hair. I had butt-length hair growing up (my parents wouldn't let me cut it) and I HATED it. Like, I never learned how to braid it or put it into a ponytail because I just hated touching the stuff. The second I moved out of the house I got a pixie cut and felt way better. Another thing that stands out is that I love men's clothing. Like, I've just worn regular non-girly clothes for most of my life, but I drool over well-dressed men (in a nonsexual, nonromantic way) and have specialized as a seamstress in sewing formal menswear. I even sewed my husband's waistcoat for our wedding. I went through a two-year period in college where I dressed ""like a lesbian"" --  skirts with suspenders and bowties -- and I liked that. Now that I don't go to church anymore and don't have to wear skirts, I find myself wanting to wear buttondowns, waistcoats, slacks, and Oxfords on formal days (I still basically wear graphic tees and shorts most days).

The asexual thing complicates the issue a bit, because I am undeniably attracted to spunky androgynous girls and nonbinary people. I'm pretty sure it's just aesthetic attraction? Mixed with a ""I want to look like that"" feeling? Idk, but I can't look away. My husband is the only person I've ever been romantically attracted to, and he's cis male. Add to that that people on here talk about ""bottom growth"" and that seems pretty good to me, but on they other hand who cares because I'm asexual anyways?

I'm a cosplayer, and generally in the past I've been okay to be a female who just dresses up as males (always) for conventions. Crossplay has kept me feeling good. Lately, though, I want to go into the men's restroom when I want to and let people call me ""he"" if they want to without confusing my family.

I SHOULDNT HAVE TO LOP EM OFF JUST TO BE SHIRTLESS! MY NIPS ARE JUST AS HAIRY AS SOME MALES, JUST A BLOB LIKE AS SOME MALES, AND YET I HAVE TO HIDE MINE?!

I'm currently shirtless in my room in the dark and I'm just feeling quite dysphoric about my chest. I dont want to remove them. I shouldn't feel disgust for having them just because they are viewed a certain way. They are mine and my body does not define me! And yet here I am being labeled anything and everything I am not because of them (and more).

I want to find a way to express these feelings so that I can try to move on with my life but I feel so ugly and ashamed and disgusting. I'm just not ready to admit half the time I dont identify as cis. 

I went to pride not too long ago and I live in an area where it's legal to be topless for folks such as myself and I wanted to so bad and yet- I just couldn't do it. Why?

I've felt this way since my early preteen years and have been out to myself since the moment I discovered trans identities existed at around 14. 

As much as I hate the word dysphoria it's what I'm feeling. How do yall combat these feelings? What are gender affirming things yall can do? What kind of outlets do you use to express these feelings productively? 

I'm lucky to at least be in a more sound head space and to have the terminology to express myself some now than when I was a child. I would resort to many unhealthing coping mechanisms that ultimately led me to darker times.

- Elif Shafak

The thing that has always bothered me the most was the certainty of others. Everyone else is so sure about who and what you are. Hauntingly certain. Imagine if picking up a few items at some shop gave a stranger the right to enter your home; to leap back in fear or plunge forth in rage when you’ve knocked something over. You know you’re not a ghost. You know you’ve been violated. You know their items don’t belong there. But they’ve been made to believe deep in their bones that their anger is justified, and that their fear is as valid as the quickening of their breath. That they have the right to reduce you to splinters in your own home. A home you haven't even fully explored. To perceive yourself as clearly as you feel is nearly impossible under those conditions. Society likes to treat its Genderqueer population as if we were anomalies. 

As if we're plagued by some fever that compromises our clarity, but that couldn't be any more further from the truth. In reality every GQ/NB person you encounter is usually living their life trying to be sane enough for an entire city or town and, sometimes an entire nation or country. Our clarity is not compromised. On the contrary its been augmented by circumstance. What was initially an inner experience has evolved into a raft for others amid an already discouraging situation. In almost every interaction we're essentially carrying others inside the depths of our identity from one point of possibility to another. When and how we do it is irrelevant. Some of us do it while dancing. Some of us do it with a stoic silence. Some of us do it while bursting with color. But seeing it done is always an unmistakable event of grace amid the prevailing chaos.

I came out in around 2015ish when I found what gender dysphoria was and what trans was. I related to both of the defintions. I came out as genderfluid, then demiboy, and then binary trans man back to just nonbinary. 

My family wasn’t.... accepting at all about my transition until around 2017ish. Two years, almost. My dad told me would never called me [redacted]. I was possibly, almost sent to conversion therapy by my grandparents claiming that I needed “help”. 

I thought I would never get my first binder. My name changed. My pronouns respected. Tesestrone. Surgery. Or that there would even be an option for that. That I could be respected and be me. 

Now? Now, I’ve gone to pride for the first time in Washington D.C. We came late due to traffic and not knowing where to go but even a glimpse of it was amazing. I felt whole. There were other people out and proud and I was even *with* them. I saw my future right then and there. I’m even going to the pride in Richmond Virginia in September. 

Now, I have my name changed. I’m officially [redacted]. This is the first year of high school I won’t have to “my last name is [redacted] but I go by [redacted]. They’ll look at the paper and go, “is [redacted] here?” There won’t be an awkward stares or asking why I go by a totally different name. My name won’t appear differently on my computer and be different in the system. I’ll walk into high school, my senior year, first thing on Monday and feel proud of myself. Of the accomplishment that I made at this school. 

Now, I’ve had three chest binders from GC2B and even getting the rainbow one tommorow. Now, I’m able to have a flat chest and be able to not worry about my chest for one second. 

Now, my pronouns are respected even though, one time four months ago, I thought I was cis. Now, people are using he/they and seeing me as he/they and I’m not getting rude comments about me being trans. I’m accepted even to those who may not understand. 

Now, people at church are coming to me telling me there stories about being lgbtq+ . Now, my mom is standing up for herself when some people from church ask her “morals” because she posted pride pictures. She told me, she isn’t going to be closeted about supporting me. She’s going to support her, son. I’m her son.  My dad? Now, he calls me [redacted]. Now, he corrects himself whenever he makes mistakes. Now, he calls me sir, his son, a boy. 

My family is even more accepting now then they ever had been. My mom told me if I always want to be called he/they she would call me he/they. 

Now, my moms friends family kids are seeing me as “one of the boys”. I’m one of the boys. 

I’m not saying all this to brag, I’m saying this, for those who are young and not yet visible, that you will be visible one day. I promise. Your fight isn’t over and you will be heard. Even those, who aren’t young, you will be able to out and loud, I promise you.

So now, here’s the thing. It started with my cousin, who’s super awesome and the best cousin ever. He was talking to me about sweet 16 and how it was a real big party for teenage girls in particular, but then said something along the lines of “but it could be for whatever you identify with” hmm
Next I went to his house because he and my other cousin, his sister, had some hand me downs. First he got some of his clothes and a couple of his sisters clothes, but before getting her clothes he said to me, “I don’t know how feminine you want to go but you might like some of these.” Hmmm
Now the third thing (sorry if y’all are getting bored with this) was when I was messing around with my little brothers friends (nine year old boys) at the park. Casually this one kid said something like “(name) isn’t really a girl and (name) isn’t really a boy.

My name is Logan and I am a researcher at UC Santa Cruz. We are conducting a study on the relationship between participation in online communities and well-being for transgender people (including non-binary and genderqueer people who identify as trans). I identify as non-binary trans myself, and my hope is that this research can lead to a better understanding of how online trans communities can enhance well-being.

I am sharing the survey here for anyone who would like to participate. Participation is voluntary, your answers will be kept confidential, and you can stop the survey at any time. The survey is expected to take approximately 15 minutes.

Participants must:
-	Be 18+
-	Currently reside in the US
-	Identify as transgender

*We are especially interested in the experiences of trans people who are over 40, trans people of color, and trans people who identify as having a disability*

You can participate by visiting the following site:

If you have any questions, please reach out to me at lbarsigi@ucsc.edu.

When i came out to them as bi a few years ago (loll, when I thought I was a cis bi man, I was so wrong), they were initially completely ignorant about the whole thing in pretty hurtful way, but have now come around to it and are fine.

If anyone has some feedback, let me know! Do you think this communicates my point? Do you think it will make sense to my cis, trans-ignorant parents?

Thanks!!

\---------------------------------

Dear Mom and Dad,

Please read this entire message before doing anything, such as contacting me. 

I have something I need to tell you: I am nonbinary.

Nonbinary, as in, I no longer identify as a man. I am transgender, but not a trans woman either. I am nonbinary because my gender does not fit into the gender binary of male and female.

Before I go any further, I’ll try to define some terms that might help you understand the language I will use to talk about my gender. 

Nonbinary is a label for any gender identity that is not completely male, or completely female. Nonbinary is an umbrella term encompassing many more specific labels—such as genderfluid and agender—but it is also used as an identity on its own, by many people who don’t have a more specific label they feel fits their gender.

Transgender is a label for any person who identifies as a gender that is not their assigned gender at birth. (Assigned gender at birth is the trans approved way to communicate ""biological sex""). Not all transgender people are nonbinary, but all nonbinary people are technically transgender according to this definition.

I am nonbinary and transgender. 

I have know and accepted this identity for a while, but I have been extremely unwilling to come out to you both about it in any way, until very recently. However I am now at a place with my gender identity that I can’t go any longer hiding this from you without feeling completely ingenue in our relationship, and incurring significant damage to my mental health. This is because I am finally starting to express myself in my daily life in a way that feels so much more true to who I am than pretending to be a cis man ever has. I absolutely cannot come home and pretend this isn’t a thing, and hide this from you; it simply will not work. This is a very real part of my identity, and you need to know about it now.

You might be wondering, what do I mean that I am starting to express myself in a more genuine way? Well, a more precise way of saying this is that I have made/am making changes to my presentation so that my gender expression is more aligned with my gender identity. This means, I have been wearing different types of clothes (and by different type, I mean women’s). I have been asking people to use they/them pronouns for me. I have been coming out to the people around me so that they will affirm my identity. etc.

I am coming out to you now because staying in the closet is simply not an option for me. Honestly, living at home during august was extremely difficult at times for me. One big part of many people’s trans experiences is *gender dysphoria*. Here is a medical description of gender dysphoria: [https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) (the definition sections of this page also contains useful information). Gender dysphoria is extremely distressing, and for me being expected to act like a cis man triggers it significantly, making me feel like shit. Living at home during August this summer was really hard because if you don’t know about my transness, and I have to pretend to be cis around you, it makes me feel awful and is very unhealthy. This is my completely real experience; coming out to you now and being able to express my true self around you has direct, tangible consequences for me and my mental health. 

This brings me to my final point of this letter. I understand you are probably very confused by all this; I know you don’t know much about trans identities, from past conversations we’ve had, and the first time I came out to you as any type of queer you were pretty shocked. I am be happy to answer your questions about my nonbinary identity, so that you can understand it better. However, I will not tolerate you questioning the very nature of my gender identity. This is real, it is not a phase, and you need to accept that. I am happy to answer your well intended questions, but I am not at all opening myself up to a dialogue where I have to defend myself from your doubts. 

I am doing this over email because I am honestly terrified of your reaction. If you react to this in a negative way, it will be extremely upsetting and hurtful, and it will have a lasting impact on my ability and willingness to trust you with any emotional content about my life. This is not about you, or your future grandchildren, or your ideas about what my life will be like. I am not sharing this with you for anything having to do with you; I am telling you this because I need your support on this journey, and I want to be able to express my true self around the people that matter most to me: my family.

That being said, I am really doing this over email so that you can have whatever initial reaction you are going to have, without me seeing it. Please, do not contact me until you have had sufficient time to think this over so that you can react positively to me.

I'm up north, but, I'm from the south, and, I really know how it's like to be singled out and attacked because of your queer identities. I'm sure many of us do, if not all of us! In some way or another! But.. I don't want it to happen at work! No drama. Just do my job, be pleasant with my coworkers, and move on.

I decided I would try to make friends with some of my coworkers, too.. Some people from the next department over.... There's this guy, and, I invited him to hang out but, I told him, ""If we're going to hang out in person, then, I really want to tell you, because you should know, I'm nonbinary."" He was incredibly respectful and asked me what my pronouns were! And so I gave them to him! And then told him about how I felt about it at work and what not and why I don't go by those pronouns at work.

Well, he's never once misgendered me. He always uses the right pronouns. He's asked me how he should introduce me to his family, that he *will introduce me* with my correct pronouns if I want, and will double down on that, or, he could let me be incognito. It's. So respectful. It sends me over the moon. My dudes. I've gotten a crush on him...

Today I met some of his close friends for the first time. I didn't introduce myself with my pronouns or anything like that... Just my name! But, apparently they were told beforehand. Somebody misgenered me, and then quickly went and corrected himself to use the right pronouns instead.

But I was embarrassed... and I didn't want to be seen as annoying? As a neucanse or anything like that? I knee jerked into this submissive thing, waving my hand saying it's alright. Just. I didn't want to take up that space... make things harder for anyone at all.. I wanted things to be easier.. They percieve me as a certain way, and it's okay...... I'm the first nonbinary person that my friend has ever known (or at least that has come out to him as such)... I just.. Don't want to be in the way.

But I'm embarrassed, and, I also don't want it to continue in the future with the wrong pronouns or anything like that.... My friend has only continued using the correct ones but...

Are there any good sites for buying masc clothing that will fit someone with large breasts?

2019-08-25 17:54:12,cvbqcf,6,11,"I decided I wanted a men's suit for my best friend's wedding that is coming up in October. My other friend who is also AFAB enby went with me, which was awesome 'cause I was already nervous about how the salesmen would react to me wanting menswear.

\***TL;DR** to skip

Our first stop was to Men's Wearhouse. Yes, our salesperson was a little like, ""Uh...okay..."" when we told him we both wanted men's suits and we didn't know where to start. But he kept it professional and helped walk us through the process. He kept calling us ""she's"" and thought that we were a couple, but overall he was really trying his best to be respectful and answer all our questions. He took our chest measurements. We were both wearing binders. We tried on some jackets so he could see how they fit on us and if we looked best in slim or modern fit. (Modern fit is more boxier in the torso. For me, as an average size female-bodied person, the modern fit looked a little frumpy. I was strongly advised to do slim fit.)

**-Option A:** Buy a suit off the hanger (about 300-400 US dollars) and then pay extra to have it tailored. ALL of the ready-made suits came in the American style which features two front buttons, long V-shaped lapels, and two vents in the back of the jacket (these vents or slits kind of sit over your butt and can help minimize the booty). The pants are pretty straight relaxed fit. Color options were mostly navy blues, blacks, and greys. European style suits were not even an option.

Uh...okay that option is great if you have a male physique. I'm not broad enough in the shoulders to fit even a rather small, slim fit jacket. And apparently, it is very difficult (some stores won't do it at all) to take the shoulder seam and padding in. Because I could not fill out the shoulders, the upper back and neck area of the jacket would create a fold or crease. It didn't bother *me* that much, but every male opinion seemed to be that the jacket didn't fit right. And to be fair, their job is to make sure I look my best and it fits me super well. So off the hanger wasn't my best option.

**-Option B:** Get a custom suit. With this option, I was able to pick out the fabric I wanted and also the lining for the jacket. I'll be honest...I was disappointed with the variety. The basic suit fabrics were pretty bland. And the really nice, fun lining prints (skulls, flowers, occasion prints) were in a separate, more expensive section. I realize most men want a basic suit that will get them through many occasions considering how much they pay for it. But I really thought they'd have some fun, creative fabrics.

If we decided to go this route, all of our measurements would be taken, we could choose from some different lapel types for the jacket and for the vest, and we would be able to come in for a final fitting in 4-5 weeks or so. From there we could do small adjustments if necessary. Once you purchase a suit, you get free alterations FOR LIFE. (This is great to know for those who want to be or are on T or are waiting for surgery. As your body changes, you'd still be able to keep the suit you like and tweak it to fit your new body.) For an AFAB person, this clearly IS the better option. However, I am not made of money and because my need for a suit currently fits only one occasion (I don't need a suit for business or work), it was a bit much for me to spend when I'd only wear it maybe a few times.

So I asked how much a custom jacket would be, without the pants or vest. It starts at $675 or so.

Just the custom vest and pant? About $450 to start.

A entirely custom suit? Probably over $1000.

That was out of my price range. But at least I got a lot of my questions answered and got to try some things on.

So we went to check out K&amp;G Fashion Superstore. This store had a bunch of ready-made suits. And even when I found one that fit me in the chest and was more snug in the waist, it was still too broad in the shoulders and I was told that this could not be tailored. However, the suits here were significantly cheaper, somewhere between $150 and $200 for most of them (this usually only included a jacket and pant. SOME came with a vest as well). Shortening the sleeves cost about $18. Much much more affordable. But they all came in the same basic greys, blacks or blues.

But, that store had a LOT of really awesome accessories. Bow ties, neck ties, kits that included: suspenders, bow tie, pocket square all in one, and lots and lots of other tie colors and options with fun prints too! 

Because I wasn't willing to spend that much money for something that wasn't going to fit me well enough, I ended up at the mall in a store called Uniqlo, and bought a much more casual pant and matching jacket for about $100. I was able to find an extra small jacket that *actually* fit me in the shoulder. For those that don't know this store, it is a Japanese clothing company that makes pretty basic items at very affordable prices. So, because the sizes generally come smaller, I was able to fit much better into men's clothes. I also found socks to match my button-up shirt!

\***TL;DR** So. Let me go over the key points here:

\-Go to a place like Men's Wearhouse, if only to get your measurements taken and to try on different fits so you can get an idea of your size and what looks good on you. Wear whatever undergarments (binder, etc.) you plan on wearing so that your measurements will come out accurately. 

\-You can try to find a ready-made suit either at a superstore or maybe a thrift store and have it altered. This will probably be the more cost-effective strategy.

\-Stores like Nordstrom or Macy's seem to carry the same basic American suit style in the SAME colors for *quite* the price mark-up.

\-You could order a suit from custom websites that cater to AFAB and trans bodies. But these tend to be pricey and you don't get the in-person consultation that you would at a brick-and-mortar store.

\-You can get a completely custom suit with free alterations for life at Men's Wearhouse. This is a great option if you truly plan on utilizing it a lot and are concerned that as your body changes, your suit may have to change with you too.

I'm AMAB, but more and more I find I have times where I either feel especially feminine, or at least like male just isn't me. I play as female characters in video games, wish I could grow my hair out, and have even asked some really close friends to try referring to me with both male and female pronouns. Obviously this isn't everything, just some examples.

Given the chance, I would like to try things like shaving my body hair, buying/wearing more feminine clothing from time to time, possibly even trying makeup. Honestly the thing holding me back from trying these things is, in short, being incredibly self-conscious. I worry a lot about people judging me, thinking I'm strange, and it certainly doesn't help that my family has some...less educated ideas about how gender works. I've only told my absolute closest friends that this is even something on my mind.

I came out to my parents a little over a year ago, as they were coming to my senior exhibition and graduation, but they never really acknowledged it, saying it was too hard to change how they thought of me, but supported me anyways. They never said a word to anyone else in my family, and are quite whenever I mention anything about LGBT at extended family outings. My mother is terrified of me getting top surgery, which has been my major life goal for 10 years, and keeps begging me to get a reduction instead, and freaks out whenever I mention my research on low-dosing T.

The biggest problem I have (aside from being called by the wrong name and being misgendered, which happens at work anyways despite my pronoun pin and never even introducing myself at all in relation to my dead name) is that my family loves to buy me clothes. Any chance for giving a gift involves clothes. I have no idea why, I have never been able to steer them away from it.

Now, I've had a fairly established, masculine looking aesthetic they've all seen for a very long time. I've openly worn a binder for years. They used to be pretty good about getting me clothes it looked like I would wear: neutral stuff, or more kind of masculine clothes.
Since I've come out to my mother, that's all flipped. Its a CONSTANT barrage of items I literally can't put on without crying. Lacy things, peplums, colors I never touch, plunging necklines and breast form fitted clothes. I've given almost all of it away to friends or charity, because the idea if wearing it makes me miserable. I can put up with a l o t to make my family at least tolerable, but I can't do this anymore. I'm at my wits end with this. I can't even tell them I dont like it because they'll be hurt and disappointed and make me feel guilty, and personally I'll feel ungrateful. But I can't keep doing this, and pretending I'm glad that my relatives are trying to dress me like the woman they want me to be, while I'm doing so much work to estrange myself from that.

They're not conservatives, and they've always been supportive of my sexuality, with the exception of a few rare incidents. I don't know how to deal with this, and I really need some help.

When I talk to people about pronouns they are generally supportive but say the hard part is just practicing with a new habit of speaking. Children’s books are literally designed to help with that kind of learning by using clear, repetitive stories. 

I really want to make something that is plain and accessible for kids and adults so they can just practice using gender neutral vocabulary.  The BusyTown series is a great example- it was updated recently so that gendered words like “policeman” are changed to “police officer” etc. in the new editions.

I want a kids book with regular characters doing regular things- I.e. “my friend has a job, they work at the grocery store. I saw my neighbor today, they said hello.”

There are certain things that I’m wondering how to handle properly such as titles for family members that don’t have a universally adopted pronoun (aunt, nephew, etc). Maybe those things would be addressed directly in a future book. 

Anyway, I haven’t found too many other things like this. I will definitely take new recommendations if they are out there.

2019-08-26 23:42:45,cvw5lv,6,5,"I posted here a couple months ago and never followed up but last night I had a sudden wave of gender panic so here I am :P Luckily I still have a drafted post from then (made a couple edits/additions just now but mostly this is from 2 months ago)

Basically I'm interested in presenting more androgynously. I am consistently read as binary male (apparently seem gay though), but would hope to convey a bit more of my complex relationship with gender... The problem is that despite feeling internal nonconformity, my natural clothing selection is typically ""masculine"" (t-shirts/jeans). I would be happy if somebody encouraged me to explore skirts etc, but I don't feel particularly euphoric either way, so I stick to what I'm used to.

What prompted me to want to talk to others was realizing that I am drawn to ""masculine"" clothing tailored in ""feminine"" ways, i.e. women's suits/dress shirts, which got me thinking about ways I can present androgyny without skirts/dresses or other traditional ""femininity.""

So here's info about what I like/am looking for, and basically any brainstorm would be appreciated :) I want to explore more but also not feel like I'm putting on an act. I just don't know anything about fashion, don't have enough drive to learn about it myself, and have no friends to ask about it!

\- I like nail polish sometimes. If that seems like a good way to add androgyny I could start painting my nails more consistently

\- I have a cotton button up shirt/blouse borrowed (stolen) from my mom. It makes me feel really nice to wear, but isn't great for everyday. In addition to the formality factor, white shirts make me so anxious about stains, so i don't wear this shirt often! (I don't know how to describe the shirt I have but another kind I also like is the more billowy shirts associated with vampires/pirates... But in a cool way not a halloweeny way. Idk if I like to wear those or just think theyre sexy lol)

\- I also have a longsleeve t shirt that... Well there's nothing especially feminine about it, but for some reason it feels feminine or androgynous to me. It's just a grey tee with the sleeves a slightly different color, and a v-shape sewn at the neckline. Oh and it possibly has elbow patches? Another thing I love. Maybe a women's shirt so a slightly feminine cut. I also think that a waiter called me + a group ""ladies"" when I was wearing it so it may just feel feminine through association to that event.

\- I like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x78_wysTnv4/TrMnS9F9IPI/AAAAAAAAA8o/IiSTEYgcA-A/s640/dear+%252831+of+43%2529.jpg) sort of thing (sweater + collared shirt)

\- Overall dresses/skirts ? Something like [this](https://images.prod.meredith.com/product/fd7ab8326f2cfccb1304c749d2469b0d/1529082663767/l/pinstripe-overall-dress) . I saw a friend's sister wearing something like this although the skirt extended a bit more up the torso, like a small brace/corset (??) and it was so pretty. Again it's hard to know what I want to look like vs what I want to look at.

\- I wouldn't want to wear a very short skirt. Anything above the knee I'd want some form of leggings just for my own comfort. Like I said not especially sure I'll explore skirts, but if anybody has advice for wearing skirts on top of something else, or on how to style longer skirts, that would be a good thing for me to keep in mind.

\- I bought a skirt and leggings online and wore them once, which was weird (unfamiliar) but I felt cute. [https://ibb.co/WpBMpdH](https://ibb.co/WpBMpdH) No euphoria or dysphoria about it, so the thing is without encouragement I would be unlikely to wear that type of thing often. My general approach to clothing is just what's comfortable and easy. I like to look nice but the most effort I'll go to is getting clothes I like, and then putting them on... At this point the unfamiliarity of skirts outweighs the reasons to wear them, especially with outside perceptions and assumptions.

\- I LOVE overalls. Need to get more. You can't show off cool shirts, though. [https://ibb.co/4jjqCGs](https://ibb.co/4jjqCGs)

2019-08-27 00:02:47,cvwea1,0,1,"My fantasy story is about werewolves. Some werewolves are mages and a mage’s gender can vary outside of assigned genders, generally falling under the nonbinary umbrella. This is thought to be a spiritual effect from their magic.

Other werewolves and humans can absolutely be transgender, but mages are the most common population.

This is considered a normal part of werewolf culture.

I’ve already developed a canon pronoun set, which goes ve/vir/vis/vis/virself. Ve rhymes with bee, vir with deer, and vis with kiss.

I like this set because “ve” follows the pattern of “he and she” and is easily differentiated in text and during speech without seeming abnormal.

Now I’m looking for nouns for nonbinary people and genders that would refer to both werewolves and humans. These words would be “borrowed” from the werewolf language and used in English.

For example, words related to “woman” are girl, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, and etc.

Those are the type of words I’m looking for. Men are male and use masculine pronouns, women are female and use feminine pronouns, and [x] are [x] and use [x] pronouns.

Whenever I have discoursed with a lot of people across whom I have come on political issues like trans rights, and more specifically the non-binary culture of which the trans community is part in my estimation, I am honestly looked at with a freak look, one which suggests that I have uttered something like, ""I am am an alien"" --- which is synonymous to one's saying one is NB in the estimation of some, for one's possibilities of gender identification are binary: man or woman, so for one to say otherwise is simply alien to truth and reality.

I have been told that non-binary people are just transtrenders, that you are just identifying as non-binary because it is cool for you to call yourself trans, and you are contributing to the degradation of those members of the 'real' trans community by impeding their progress by convincing people that a gender identity is a sociocultural man-made fiction of some nature, which is something that can be turned off and on and changed like a light switch.

Others say it a phase through which the youngest NB people will grow out once the fad of transness has largely faded from the West. Even giant academic women feminists such as Camille Paglia claim that trans people, not really NB individuals too specifically, are creations of the social constructionist feminist camp which purports that gender doesn't really exist and that masculinity and men are evil and toxic definitionally, that one can be whatever and or whoever one wants, regardless of evidence to the contrary, that trans gender identities are taken up by those who would've become hippies in the 1960s or something for example, and she earnestly concludes that embracing transness is a sign of a [""cultural collapse""] (https://youtu.be/I8BRdwgPChQ), which is of course something to which many people seem to subscribe. 

To illustrate with a fine specimen of an example: it is very, very hard for many cis folks to fathom how one's gender identity can be fluid rather than fixed and thus static, how one can feel more like X on Monday and more like Y and or Z and or something else on Tuesday or Wednesday or something. How can those who have less or non-static gender identities be liberated from these kind of conditions under which are being lived?

How can we liberate NB gender identities from the notion that they are just fads, modern-made human creations, trendy subcultural fashions to which they who wish to seem 'cool' subscribe, and something from which every genuine trans person, by which is meant binary-identified trans people, must flee entirely, lest they harm themselves and their trans men brothers and trans women sisters?",NonBinary,"How can the idea that non-binary gender identities are faux, made up, or being taken up, especially by young(er) trans folks due to very dominant subcultural fashions, be crushed?",1566938162.0,"{'created_utc': 1566912962, 'id': 'cw4jxm', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I am a cis person who is a trans ally who asks this very inflammable question with the utmost respect to all trans people, including NB folks.\n\nWhenever I have discoursed with a lot of people across whom I have come on political issues like trans rights, and more specifically the non-binary culture of which the trans community is part in my estimation, I am honestly looked at with a freak look, one which suggests that I have uttered something like, ""I am am an alien"" --- which is synonymous to one\'s saying one is NB in the estimation of some, for one\'s possibilities of gender identification are binary: man or woman, so for one to say otherwise is simply alien to truth and reality.\n\nI have been told that non-binary people are just transtrenders, that you are just identifying as non-binary because it is cool for you to call yourself trans, and you are contributing to the degradation of those members of the \'real\' trans community by impeding their progress by convincing people that a gender identity is a sociocultural man-made fiction of some nature, which is something that can be turned off and on and changed like a light switch.\n\nOthers say it a phase through which the youngest NB people will grow out once the fad of transness has largely faded from the West.

2019-08-27 14:06:11,cw4xno,4,3,"My fantasy story is about werewolves. Some werewolves are mages and a mage’s gender can vary outside of assigned genders, generally falling under the nonbinary umbrella. This is thought to be a spiritual effect from their magic.

Other werewolves and humans can absolutely be transgender, but mages are the most common population and this is considered a normal part of werewolf culture.

I’ve already developed a canon pronoun set, which goes ve/vir/vis/vis/virself. Ve rhymes with bee, vir with deer, and vis with kiss.

I like this set because “ve” follows the pattern of “he and she” and is easily differentiated in text and during speech without seeming abnormal.

Now I’m looking for nouns for nonbinary people and genders that would refer to both werewolves and humans. These words would be “borrowed” from the werewolf language and used in English.

For example, words related to “woman” are girl, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, and etc.

Those are the type of words I’m looking for. Men are male and use masculine pronouns, women are female and use feminine pronouns, and [a] are [b] and use [c] pronouns.

Hi all, I’ve been realizing more and more I fit into a non-binary space in terms of gender. My problem is, it’s forced me to come to terms with my internalized transphobia and lack of ability currently to see gender beyond the binary. I have a very “I’m either male or female which is it” approach and it’s making me miserable. 

For anyone who has struggled to unlearn this and was successful, what has helped you? I’m thinking a good place to start is to practice seeing other NBs as truly beyond gender. I was getting into a very unhealthy habit of trying to figure out people’s sex at birth and I recognize that is toxic energy and accomplished nothing. 

I’m sorry for acting this way, and I hope none of my behaviors have spilled into how I’ve interacted with non-binary people. I fully respect your identity; it’s been an internal struggle that I let consume me beyond myself. For some context, my mom has been very unsupportive of the idea of physical transition, and I think I’m trying to fit into a box of masculine female in order to keep our relationship steady.

2019-08-29 00:01:09,cwt2h9,3,3,"I should preface this by saying this is not something that was easy to share for me. I've been struggling with these feelings for so long, expressing them was very hard.

So, for a bit of background, I'm in my early 20s, AFAB and realized I was trans when I was 14. Before that, I didn't know trans men existed, only trans women. Discovering there were other people who felt like me was like a revolution. I struggled with my country's medical healthcare system for years until 3 years ago, when I was finally allowed to go on T. In the meantime, I explored my feelings about gender and realized I didn't exactly want to be a man, I just didn't want to be female. I quickly started identifying as agender.

I loved the voice T gave me, the body shape and stamina, however the libido has been overwhelming and feeling kinda like poison, while the hair is kind of a mixed bag of feelings. About 8 months ago, I got top surgery which also was an immense relief. But for some reason, something felt terribly off and for the longest time, I just couldn't put my finger on it.

I'm terribly jealous of trans women. Not trans men, not cis men, not AFAB nb people- *trans women*(alongside some AMAB nb people). I don't know exactly what it is: envy over having been born with more masculine body? fitting in the role of a woman better than I ever could? some internalized misogyny relating to bodies again?

I have no clue. All I know is that while transitionning has made me feel immensely better, I feel that if I had been born with a male body, I would've also ended up transitionning.

I really don't know what this is, and I feel like a creepy fetishist or a ""fake"" transtrender having these feelings.

I've also been looking into nullos (people looking to remove any genitals and secondary sexual characteristics), to whom I relate a lot, but while getting nullification surgery as an AMAB person looks close to GRS for trans women, getting it as an AFAB person looks to other more like FGM and I don't really know how to pursue it without looking like a nutcase. The main appeal behind it, besides the obvious dysphoria I have, would be that nullification looks the same for every sex, and that I would probably look like an AMAB person who's been nullified than the other way around just because guys are the ones who get it the most (and also I pass as male).

Maybe being nonbinary and not having an actual target ""sex"" that exists for it is what's causing the issue here, but it's just so confusing. I don't know if I'm weirdly fetishizing trans women, AMAB bodies, or just having a weirdass nonbinary meltdown.

This probably looks really really weird to most, but if any of you has any clue as to what's going on, or any past experience in mind they can relate to this, I'd love to hear it.

2019-08-29 22:47:26,cx89al,2,1,"Hey all,

So the long and short of it is that I get really dysphoric whenever one of my friends takes steps towards medically transitioning. 

I'm undecided as to whether or not I should, because while I do want most of what HRT would provide me, it would impair my genital function, which I very much do not want. That's not really what I'm posting about, but it is relevant I think.

Whenever any of my friends takes steps towards medically transitioning, I get *incredibly* dysphoric. Obviously, this isn't great, because dysphoria fucking sucks. What's more troubling, is that my first reaction isn't happiness for them. I feel guilty that my first reaction is to feel insecure about my gender identity, and guilty that I haven't decided whether or not I want to medically transition (which then leads to questioning the validity of my identity, of course). 

I haven't told anyone or shown these feelings to anyone, as I don't want them to feel bad about their gender stuff, or feel like they have to hide anything from me. I think that's pretty fair, at least until I have a better understanding of why my feelings are how they are, and how I can best manage them.

I want to understand why this is my reaction, so that I can work through it. It's obviously not healthy, because it makes me feel bad for no good reason. Normally, I would speak to a therapist about this, but I currently don't have insurance, and as such that's not an option for me. Definitely plan to speak to one the moment I have insurance again, but for the moment, I'm on my own with this, and it is shitty. Self-examination is definitely in order, of course, and that's something that I'm pretty well-versed in; but it's much more difficult without at least a little bit of professional assistance 

I just had to get these thoughts out somewhere, and I figure this community would be a good place to do so. You're all wonderful people, and I wish you all the best with whatever it is you're going through right meow. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",NonBinary,Dysphoria Related to my Indecision Regarding Medically Transitioning- A Ventpost,1567144046.0,"{'created_utc': 1567118846, 'id': 'cx89al', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hey all,\n\nSo the long and short of it is that I get really dysphoric whenever one of my friends takes steps towards medically transitioning. \n\nI'm undecided as to whether or not I should, because while I do want most of what HRT would provide me, it would impair my genital function, which I very much do not want.

2019-08-29 23:30:34,cx8si2,6,12,"Hey gang, whats up? 

So, here's the deal. For the past like two years, I've identified as a trans woman, came out to all my family, my job, and been on HRT for a year and a half. All was good, up until recently, I finally admitted to myself that in actuality i am nonbinary. In fact if I really think hard about it, I think I identified myself that way because it seemed more ""normal"" than non-binary. I still heavily identify with femininity and don't intend to change my hrt regimen at the moment, I just can't deny at this point the connection I still feel to masculinity, yknow?

Anyways, on to the main point. As I said before, I basically fully came out and whatnot. I finally in March got my parents to start calling me Sarah and she/her, and they haven't even slipped up in months. But it was a struggle to get to this point, and even to get them to accept me as binary trans. I got everybody's favorite (/s) lines such as ""how do you know it's not just a phase?"" or ""You can't be sure"" and ""I feel like my son died"" and my personal favorite (/s) ""You expect people to call you Sarah when you still look like a man?"" but that's all in the past now.

Because of this past history, I'm especially not excited to come out a second time to them. I feel like everything that was said before will come back: ""how do we know *this* isn't just a phase?"" 

In addition to that, I honestly feel like I'll be seriously inconveniencing people by changing my name again, especially after already doing so once, and when they've only just recently gotten used to it. And that isn't limited to just my family either, probably about half my coworkers, some friends, etc. And it sucks cause I'd really really love to change my name to Rowan and go by they/them pronouns, but I feel like this shit is holding me back a lot.

2019-08-31 09:23:05,cxtzaf,10,6,"Hey y’all,

I’m a cis girl who has been in a relationship with someone who is non-binary, genderqueer. We have dated for 3 years, a year and a half to almost two years ago we stopped having sex. During this time they had gender dysphoria and started taking anxiety medication (somewhat related to one another I think but also they’ve had anxiety all their life). We have a loving relationship in every other way. Recently we broke up because they’ve felt so much pressure, anxiety and physical pain over the fact that we haven’t had sex. They say it feels like a physical roadblock, like they cannot get themselves to have sex with me even though they find my physically attractive. Of note, I’ve told them it’s okay if we don’t have sex for however long and I’ve never pressured them for sex but that has not eased their anxiety. 

When they started taking anxiety medication they lost all sex drive which is a side effect but last year (while taking medication) they started having a strong desire to masturbate and they are able to with enjoyment. Has anyone else dealt with this? Of course its possible that it’s just our relationship but it’s so hard for me to believe because we’re so fulfilled in every other way and we use to have amazing sex (pre-pronoun change and top surgery). I know we aren’t getting back together, at least not anytime soon. They said they hope we can try again in the future if it works out that way but they have to let go completely otherwise they’ll be too afraid to try with someone else and see if it is just our relationship. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.

P.S They say since our breakup they have traded anxiety and feeling pressure for sadness and emptiness regarding our breakup bc we fit so well together and have so much fun with one another, they feel like they’ve lost their best friend but more than that, they feel like we’re more than friends so I believe they’re in love with me in that way.",NonBinary,Cis girl needs advice about nonhetereonormative intimacy,1567268585.0,"{'created_utc': 1567243385, 'id': 'cxtzaf', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'Hey y’all,\n\nI’m a cis girl who has been in a relationship with someone who is non-binary, genderqueer.

I’ve changed to a gender neutral name (Hi, I’m Lachlan!) and ask safe-seeming people to use they/them pronouns and when I hear people use these it’s like a weight is lifted, so I feel that I definitely am NB but at the same time I unintentionally pass as female because I really like generally feminine clothes, hair, and make-up. Because of this I almost feel weird or guilty when trying to assert my non-gender or ask people to use they/them pronouns. Has anyone else experienced this?

I'll start.

My gender, to me, is a combination of absolutely no genders but also entirely every gender at the same time. I say that it is ""no gender"", because I don't personally subscribe to the idea that there are binaries in gender. I say that it is all genders, because I respect people that use gender on the spectrum to define themselves, so from an outside perspective I am everything because I don't feel like I can place myself anywhere.

My gender, to me, is not synonymous with my physical sex characteristics. However, even if I had different sex characteristics or traits, I would *still feel the same*.
