2019-05-01 19:58:15,bjloxw,16,36,"So after I started T gel (2.5mg/day), I switched insurers. When I ran out of my Rx, and the new insurers took a minute to approve it, then insisted on shipping it to me rather than let me pick it up at a pharmacy. Which means there was about two weeks when I was off T.

I know some of us genderqueers/nonbinaries are interested in going on T and then stopping after a certain amount of change, so I thought I'd write this up.

At the end of 1 month on T I'd had a fair amount of bottom growth - about doubling my size, experiencing a lot of random hardons. I'd been sweating more heavily, my face had broken out, and a dirt 'stache was coming in on my upper lip. My libido was also way up. 

By the end of the first week off T, my libido had taken it down a notch. Spontaneous boners went away. In combination with a lot of Benzoyl soap and salicylic face toner, my acne subsided. The mustache and bottom growth stayed, but didn't advance. Second week continued the same. 

Results: Coming off T was pretty easy for me, no withdrawal symptoms. Temporary effects reversed almost immediately and changes stopped in their tracks. T appeared to clear my system in a matter of days. Conclusion: In this sample group of one, results indicate that taking T for a period and then stopping after desired physical changes occur is totally feasible.

I've realised that my common solution to my problems is 'change your physical body'. I've used the gym for the last 12 years (on and off) to try to change my body. I've wanted to change my body out of a sense of dislike of my self and my body. I hated my body, so i tried to change it repeatedly. Each time, instead of making my body more like i want (slimmer), it would instead bring my binge eating disorder to the surface and my resting weight would instead increase. 

This stems from my childhood - being bullied at school and home for being different/outside the norm in most things,  and also sexual abuse in my 20s which exacerbated that issue and caused me to reject attraction to others, sexuality and self love.

I now weigh 104kg. I'm bald, hairy/fuzzy, not flexible. But i love dancing and walking and stretching. 

From now on, my motto is 'don't change your body intentionally'. Funny thing is, i have recently been considering hrt to grow breasts and take on a more feminine body shape. Firstly,  being overweight as I am means that typically, I won't see the changes as much. But also that this is another form of me trying to change myself. 

It's going to be hard but I'm instead going to put those plans on hold and focus on liking myself exactly as I am. Expressing my true self, being myself and enjoying myself. I saw true inner beauty in another person yesterday,  which means in starting to see my own. 

Also, last night i dreamt there were two women in the basement of my house who were bad people and i was courageously confronting them and wanting to fight them and get them out of my house. I feel like its symbolic of my journey to release juju.

Anyone have any comments‚Äîadvice for others, or questions for me/others, they‚Äôd like to ask?

Also, for anyone who doesn‚Äôt wear makeup YOU ARE VALID. That‚Äôs okay! This thread is just for people who want to wear makeup. 

I‚Äôll start: for ANYONES makeup, I‚Äôm a MASSIVE ADVOCATE for going to a spa to get your brows done. Even I, AFAB, had massive unkempt brows at one point (trust me) that needed to at least be shaped. I kept them thicker, but now they frame my face. Literally one of the easiest makeup steps is getting your brows done every 4-6 wks, and simply, if needed, use a powder to fill any less thick spots. If you want more ‚Äúmasc‚Äù unshaped brows, totally ok to skip this step.

I‚Äôm a fan of an even complexion (achieved with makeup plus an amazing but inexpensive routine). Contouring HELPS for both AMAB and AFAB people‚Äîfor AFAB it can make features look more sharp and defined (read: masc), and for AMAB it can really actually do the opposite.

2019-05-03 03:40:49,bk4021,12,23,"Hello. This is my first time ever making a post on reddit, but I really needed to say this somewhere.
3 years ago I told my parents I'm non-binary and that the name I go by now is Elliot. At the time they seemed to kinda understand, and said they would try their best. 3 years have passed, and they haven't even once called me by the right name. I tried talking to them again a few weeks ago, and was met with a completely different response. They say it's too difficult for them, to know someone for 21 years and call them a certain name only to be asked to call them by another. I told them I had already given them 3 years to adapt. They don't even remember the initial conversation.
We ended up dropping the conversation and I was too scared to actually press any further.

Hello everyone, my name is bru and I am AMAB. I'm from Brazil - sorry bout the bad english :) 

&amp;#x200B;

In recent years, I have been thinking about how I view my gender and have come very close to the non-binary community, although I have never used this term to talk about myself.  I feel comfortable thinking that I am a boy - although I have never recognized myself in manhood in general. I also express myself in a little feminine way sometimes - but I do not feel comfortable being seen as ""an effeminate boy.""  A few times people think I'm a masculinized lesbian, trans man or butch. I feel quite comfortable being wrongly labeled with all these identities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I think I would feel completely comfortable if I could be seen as someone whose gender was not relevant or determining, but being AMAB and comfortable in dressing in a neutral / ""masculine"" way makes it very difficult to understand myself as a valid non-binary boy. 

&amp;#x200B;

2019-05-06 21:02:51,blhnfg,6,9,"First off:  
Hi, I'm Feu!  
Non-binary, 21 years old, moved out into my own apartment about 4 years ago, working full time, trying very hard to adult my way through life.

I see my parents roughly every 2-3 weeks for a day or two. I don't really have the best relationship with my dad (we tend to fight a lot over nothing), but I absolutely adore my mother.  
She means the world to me and she is a super sweet lady and I really _really_ don't want her to feel bad because of me.

Despite being from a small and conservative village, my family is very accepting - they support me a lot in my transition.

They started calling me by my chosen name immediately after me asking them to (with a lot of slip-ups but they usually just correct themselves most of the time).  
My mum showed me that they had changed my name in their contacts to ""Chosen name (Birth name)"".

Which is making me feel a bit conflicted, I don't particularly hate my birth name - it's just super gendered. Which is also why I don't really want it associated with me...

She told me, that she doesn't want to make me feel guilty or regret telling them, but that she would like to express a feeling she's had ever since I told them my chosen name.  
(And I love this kind of communication - letting people know what you feel, with _them_ knowing that it's not meant to hurt them)  
So, she said that she feels sad about me sort of ""rejecting"" the name they picked for me.

How can I help them to not feel as bad about it?

I would also really love to hear from parents with trans kids - and how they felt, when their kid told them about having chosen a new name for themselves :)",NonBinary,How can I help my parents deal with the fact that I am dropping the name they gave me?,1557201771.0,"{'created_utc': 1557176571, 'id': 'blhnfg', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'First off:  \nHi, I\'m Feu!  \nNon-binary, 21 years old, moved out into my own apartment about 4 years ago, working full time, trying very hard to adult my way through life.\n\nI see my parents roughly every 2-3 weeks for a day or two.

So, someone today told me, in roundabout terms, that they don't want to be friends with me anymore. Because they have other people they want to hang out with instead.

I've been incredibly happy with the results of all of these things, especially bottom surgery. For what it's worth, I've been passing as female for about 1.5 years.

Now that I'm at a point where my transition is basically ""completed"", I'm finding that I don't really feel like I'm a woman. I really like being included in female spaces and I feel *way* more comfortable around woman than men, but internally something's just... off. Of the results I've gotten from HRT, my breasts are the only thing that make me somewhat uncomfortable.

But those other sources are essentially gone now, and my discomfort with my chest is much more noticeable. I've started binding, which has been really nice, but I'm struggling with fully accepting that I might not be female.

Part of the issue is that I feel 0% male. Like, if you were to plot my gender on some line or graph, male wouldn't even be included anywhere on it. If you drew a line between two points, they'd be ""agender"" and ""female"" and I'd probably be at some point in the middle, gender neutral with hints of fem-ness. When I try to express that though, there's a fear I'll be read as male again :(

Another part of the issue is that by accepting this part of myself, I'm afraid of it meaning I lose access to female spaces or worse, get directed back into male ones. I'm afraid of being branded an outcast, and either rejected or treated differently.

Hi Everyone! TLDR: I'm AFAB and 8 years into non-binary transition and I want to tell you what I did/am doing because I wish I had access to this information in the beginning! Pronoun town: they/them

What it means for me to be non-binary is secondary sex characteristics give me dysphoria. When I started T I thought I would just pass as a man over time and didn't feel good about it. Turns out that's definitely not what's happening for me- which I personally really works for me. 

I've been on T for 8 years. I am non-binary and going on T was an experiment for me. I started with a cream and changed to a shot later. As soon as I had enough T in my system to feel the effects I realized I wasn't depressed anymore and it completely changed my emotional landscape in a way that was amazing.

I was started to have hair loss (runs in the family) and that's a dysphoria nightmare for me so I have been on Finasteride for about 7 years. It prevents balding and also slows the growth of facial and body hair. It can also slow clitoral growth but it that's already happened for you it tends to not affect it. Finasteride can affect people's sex drives but it's never had any side effects for me. If you get the bigger pills and cut them into fourths it's way cheaper. Finasteride prevents you from losing your hair and will help some of it grow back. You have to stay on it as long as you're on T. My hairline has changed and I've had a little bit of hair loss but otherwise I'm so grateful for Finasteride!

I went on shots around 1 year in. I was still having periods and I increased my T really gradually in order to be on the lowest amount I could while not bleeding. That turned into a years long problem because I had a high red blood cell count when on enough to stop bleeding but then every time I lowered it I would get my period which was the worst. I tried to get an IUD (Mirena) but this just gave me horrible cramps everyday for 3 months so I got it out and decided to get a hysto. I got a laproscopic hysto and it was so chill and easy!

I just have tiny little scars on my abdomen because they take it out trans vaginally. Recovery was really fine- I was off opiate pain meds within three days. I decided to get out my uterus and my cervix and kept my ovaries (in case I go off T someday). You have to have some sex hormones in your body for bone health so I wanted to make sure I didn't have to take E later if I wanted to switch it up.

This was covered my insurance (Kaiser) after providing letters from therapists. I kept my letters binary because I don't trust insurance companies to understand or respect non-binary transition.

For some people their cervix can feel like part of sexual pleasure and they want to keep it. Orgasms change because it turns out uterine spasms are part of orgasms- but honestly it's all good. And talking to other folks too- we have no regrets.

Getting a hysto was so that I could be on a lower dose of T and not worry about bleeding. I'm currently on .25 a week.

I changed my shots from IM to sub cu in the last 6 months. It turns out that Dr Joanna Olsen (an amazing doctor for trans youth in LA) has discovered that IM has really sped up the hair loss process for people because it results in a really high spike of DHT each time you do a shot-which is what causes balding. She thinks since she's switching her patients to sub-cu she's going to see a lot less hair loss.

I am Italian so body hair and facial hair is REAL. And gives me a lot of dysphoria. After being able to get a hysto and be on less T I decided to get laser on my torso and face. I got a groupon kind of deal so it was half off. Laser hurts real bad but it's pretty effective. I might do electrolysis in the future since laser is semi-permanent. 

I wish I had gotten a hysto within my first year of being on T- if I had then I would've stayed on the cream based T and on a low dose. The cream works a lot slower and so does being on a low dose- and is recommended for folks who want to be on T but don't want facial hair growth. I just didn't want to bleed- and I wish someone had told me how easy and great a hysto could be.

Since I was able to get laser I felt like I could move ahead with top surgery. Since I don't want to be perceived as a man or a woman my dysphoria is really about balancing that. I got top surgery about a year ago and it's so nice to not have dysphoria about my chest. 

I decided to go with Dr. Mangubat in Tukwila, WA. I have mixed feelings about my experience but the reason I went with him is it seemed more likely that I would have nipple sensation and I do. Nipple sensation is really important to me and I really still have it. I wish this was something we talked more about and I wish the scientific world studied things like this to figure out how trans people can still experience pleasure.

After electrolysis (I never want to shave my face again!) I think I'll be done with the 1000 step process of non-binary transition. I'm femme so in the world in general people usually call me she- which tbh is less dysphoric than being called he. Sometimes people think I'm trans-feminine and in general even trans folks can't tell which direction I'm transitioning. So I pretty much have reached androgynous angel level- that is my dream.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 feel free to ask questions and share this info.

About a year ago, I came to term with the fact that I am not cisgender. I'm still questioning the specifics (am I nb? A trans guy? Something else entirely?) but my doctor and I decided that it would probably be a good idea for me to go on puberty blockers. I'm 17, but that would keep my puberty from ending (to make it easier for me if I eventually wanted to go on T), and would also make me look a bit more androgynous. I could thus explore how much I like it and it should help me figure some stuff out.

The thing is, since I talked about it with my parents, I feel very discouraged about it all, and also sort of ashamed. It hurts them so much that I'm even considering transitioning, and I really wish I were cis so it could be easy for them. I don't want to be a burden to my family. I hate this feeling, and I feel like I'm betraying them. They also make me question everything, and I just feel so miserable.

I am currently in treatment for an eating disorder but I am planning to be discharged in about a month. Recently I've been backsliding a lot in terms of following my meal plan and avoiding behaviors. It all boils down to the fact that since weight restoration and the Return of the Menses, my dysphoria has been through the roof. It hasn't been this bad since I was \~11-13 (after puberty, before ED) and I don't know how to cope without going back to my ED to control my body again. 

To my dismay, I am a very feminine looking person and my weight congregates around my chest, hips, and face. I bind and wear clothes that somewhat conceal the curves I have but it still feels intolerable. When I was sick, people would call me ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" almost equally because I looked so androgynous. Now it's just WOMAN LADY FEMALE GIRL MISS MA'AM \*everywhere\* I go. Hopefully if insurance pulls through I'll be going on hormone blockers soon to prevent the ""second puberty"" and potentially low-dose T later on. I also really want to get top surgery. 

But I don't know how to cope with these feelings right now. I feel hopeless and like I'll never be comfortable in my body ever again if I don't go back to my ED.

And it's not like I want it tattooed on my forehead and want to make it always a topic of discussion, but I don't know would it really hurt so much if ya sprinkled some they's and them's in there? \n\n Maybe that's selfish of me, but I know it's my own fault, I should have been more firm about these things. Now I just feel bad every time I attempt to correct my pronouns because of the rules I already set. I have to commit to what I said or look like a hypocrite who is just  finding things to be mad at. This honestly feels worse than not having said anything at all."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I think I messed up coming out.', 'created': 1557415868.0}"

2019-05-10 17:49:58,bn1e8t,6,4,"Hi all,

I've been trying to sort through my gender issues lately and I'm not sure what to think of it all. I'm mostly wondering if anyone here can relate to my struggles and it would be nice to just get some outsiders' perspective of it all. I'm sorry that this is so long, it's been building up inside for many years with no outlet. 

I've been able to go through life as a woman up until now, at 23. But not in a way that I've ever been comfortable with. I've always had massive image and identity issues from as long as I can remember; I remember being 5 years old and hating the way I looked so much that my parents couldn't get me out of the house sometimes. This is the main thing that makes me question whether my tentative self-identification as agender is just another way I try unsuccessfully to escape this self of mine that just never feels like myself. I went through a tough mental health journey, but lately things are looking up for me - I just graduated uni doing something I love, I'm finally financially stable, I have a boyfriend I love dearly. My mental health has been slowly improving as well, I struggled with crippling anxiety that has been subsiding to manageable levels within the last half year or so. Basically I'm probably in the best mental place I've been in life so far. Things are finally looking up. And without the immediate things to take up my attention like anxiety attacks, continuous uni assessments and constant worrying about where I'll be a in a year's time, my brain decided that it's time to bring back the gender issues I had as a teen (for a few years I was questioning whether I might be MtF) and have been keeping numbed down and stashed away all this time. 

This is also probably triggered by a slight bit of weight gain which my boyfriend claims makes me look more 'womanly and healthy' - there are few words I'd rather less be described by than 'womanly'. It creates a sense of wrongness within me that after all these years of purposefully numbing it down still manages to make me uncomfortable.

About my actual gender issues: I avoid calling it dysphoria because I doubt this is what full on gender dysphoria would feel like. This is unpleasant, but can mostly be pushed away. I go for long stretches of time where I feel almost ok with my body. It never feels like /my/ body per say, just a body, that is fine in itself. But I guess this ties heavily into the fact that I never had much of a sense of physical identity in the first place.

If I could press a button and magically switch genders I would. I'm an androgynous woman, but I'd be much more comfortable as an androgynous man. I've been daydreaming of what my life would be like if I'd transition, but the truth it I'm too afraid to come out and too afraid of the length of the road ahead of me. I'm in a precarious balance where I am in discomfort, but perhaps not enough discomfort to bite the bullet and go all the way. But then I ask myself the eternal question: am I just trying to escape myself in a different way?

I am very uncomfortable with what society deems I must do in life, and how I must do it, because I was born female. I have intense social norm woman dysphoria but I think this is more of a symptom of the restrictive society we live in than of me as a woman.

That said, I don't mind my female name or female pronouns. I'm pretty sure I'd be comfortable with any pronouns. I don't mind that people can tell I'm a woman by my voice or body size or whatever else it is that gives me away. It's more of an aesthetic sense of displeasure if that makes sense. The shirts I wear don't quite fit right with breasts, my own voice is too high pitched and it doesn't sound like /my voice/. I wish my chest was flat and I wish I had some stubble.

Then I ask myself 'what good even is it to have a pleasing sense of identity. My body is a tool that allows me to do the things I love doing - what more do I need? Is this not normal? Is pretty much everyone not unhappy with themselves on some level? I try to convince myself that the sense of contentment when looking at yourself in the mirror is a frivolous luxury; that it's shallow and meaningless. Yet I feel robbed of something. I am so deeply uncomfortable.

I don't even know what coming out as agender could accomplish. It's not going to make my 'womanly shapes' any less womanly, it's not going to allow me to change anything about myself that can be changed. Maybe it would be some sort of freedom from what I perceive other people's expectation of me to be. But then shouldn't I just work harder on not letting what I think people think get to to me instead?

Basically, I'm tired. The person I see in the mirror isn't myself, and at points like now it gets too much and I just can't feel good about myself. I'm very happy with my fashion sense, with my style, with the manifestation of myself that I can control - this feels right and rewarding and brings me happiness. The body that lies underneath doesn't.

Maybe it would be some sort of freedom from what I perceive other people's expectation of me to be. But then shouldn't I just work harder on not letting what I think people think get to to me instead?\n\nBasically, I'm tired. The person I see in the mirror isn't myself, and at points like now it gets too much and I just can't feel good about myself. I'm very happy with my fashion sense, with my style, with the manifestation of myself that I can control - this feels right and rewarding and brings me happiness. The body that lies underneath doesn't.\n\nThank you for reading if you've made it thus far.

I'll be starting e in the next couple months.
Nipples will become even more visible.
I intend to stay in the closet at work (construction) for as long as possible.  I dont want to wear a binder, but I do want to obscure my nipples in a way that isn't obviously a bra that shows through my t-shirts.

Has to be breathable because my work is often hot and sweaty. I also need for it to not be obvious I'm wearing a bra.  Oh and I don't want to hinder my chest development.

Advice?

Hey. So I'm in an awkward spot gender-wise at the moment, where I'm starting to come to peace with the fact I'm genderqueer/transfemme (or something to that tune).

Im still presenting pretty masc, with feminine elements mixed in, but because of the gender stuff, I find myself having a very hard time interacting sexually with straight women, and im pretty steeped in the queer scene so i find that much more attractive intellectually than the straight dynamic.

Im also into men, but not as much as women, so my question mainly concerns queers &amp; women.

The core of my question is this: Are there any dating apps that focus on more queer dating? i find myself swiping left on 95% of tinder, and I feel Im far far far too masc right now to be venturing onto HER, is there anything else out there??

I just wish there was a miscellaneous lgbtq+ dating app that i could participate in, so i didnt need to filter through a huge amount of people who i know its not gonna be compatible. (is there an app like this??)

Also i dont mean to sound anti-straight or anything, just that my experience with cis straight women romantically often ends with me being forced into a masculine role, which i would like to avoid.

I‚Äôm trying to find out the difference between bottom dysphoria or if it‚Äôs less or something more. I identify as Asexual and female, it‚Äôs the time of the month where things usually trigger me, idk I get anxious and depressed more than usual and I think and think.
I‚Äôve always been in the mix of femininity and masculinity.

Questioning more into my Asexuality:
________________
I was thinking, maybe I‚Äôm asexual because I‚Äôm uncomfortable having sex? (( even though I‚Äôm not attracted to anyone but it can play a part, some aces are sex repulsed))
I‚Äôm not comfortable with my vagina, I feel depressed and sad almost- like I wanna rip my skin apart when I do have sex. Even simply pleasuring myself, after I‚Äôm done- I feel relief but at the same time I just get a crushing feeling. Like why? Almost shameful but not. 
________________

Body hair/my vagina:
I never shave down there, I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know, I just don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt feel compelled to, even though most prefer ‚Äòshaved‚Äô when they have sex and that also occurs in my mind. If I shaved would I be more satisfied? But then I picture it bare and I feel no relief, in fact I feel more gross. I hate the way my genitalia looks to, why. Why can‚Äôt it just poof. If it was pretty would I be happy? Would I feel satisfaction? I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes I feel a itching feeling, like irritation. It hardly comes up, if I‚Äôm thinking about preforming sex, or getting undressed for someone. I wanna hide myself. I could careless about my boobs or any other part of my body. I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my vagina. I cry sometimes, wishing I was born with a dick. I would be out of place though wouldn‚Äôt I? Can‚Äôt have both words. Would sex be different for me if I had a penis? When I do have sex I feel like almost a phantom limb, I feel the action of preforming like a male but I can‚Äôt act on it? The idea of strap ons make me slightly less afraid of sex but still, it‚Äôs not the same.

Sometimes I look at my face and think I need a more defined jaw line, ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I‚Äôm fine with my boobs, but that‚Äôs because there small. If I had actual boobs- I feel like I‚Äôd cry. I‚Äôd die. I like my feminine body but sometimes I feel like I crave something more. 


Clothing;
I feel extremely hot and bomb af when I‚Äôm wearing masculine cloths. But who cares? I don‚Äôt base myself off of items or anything of the sort. I‚Äôm a perfect mix, even my hair. I feel fine in dresses, suit and tie. Even though I dress in the in between my whole life.

Would I feel satisfaction? I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes I feel a itching feeling, like irritation. It hardly comes up, if I‚Äôm thinking about preforming sex, or getting undressed for someone. I wanna hide myself. I could careless about my boobs or any other part of my body. I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my vagina. I cry sometimes, wishing I was born with a dick. I would be out of place though wouldn‚Äôt I? Can‚Äôt have both words. Would sex be different for me if I had a penis?

2019-05-13 13:14:43,bo3bm9,4,30,"Some background:
I first started questioning my gender 3 or so years ago. Two and a half years ago I came out to my boyfriend, he was incredibly supportive, accepting and took me 'mens' clothes shopping for the first time. I was only out to him. Then 45 got elected and I hid myself away again, my 'mens' clothes and binder just sat in my closet. Over the last year I restarted coming out and expressing my true NB self. Dressing more androgynously (except sundresses because I fucking love them lol) and asking my partner to use they/them (as well as using it in large anonymous or safe spaces, like cons or in this one class that was all about LGBT issues). I've recently been considering coming out to my sister (pretty sure she suspects it as she recently told me a story about a NB person she works with and I got the vibe she's was trying to say it's okay that I am nb). My partner knows all about my NB journey and how not out I am.

What just happened:
The other night my partner (cis amab) was out with a few of his friends while I was at work. One of them has a fairly new gf and she was asking questions and getting to know everyone better. She asked about me so my partner was talking about me. He was using she/her because that's how his friends know me (I've never met the new gf) but it felt wrong to him since he knows I prefer they/them so he told them ""sometimes [name] prefers they/them"" and continued talking about me using they/them.

I feel like he outed me. He apologized and I can tell he feels bad. But he also said he doesn't think they'll remember (it was late and they had been drinking) and that it was a subtle out. But I feel like saying that I'm a not a she is like a step away from saying I am trans. And I also really doubt his friends know anyone who uses they/them IRL so it could be pretty memorable. The friends that were there are pretty chill but some of his friend group is more conservative and nearly all his friends like making jokes to get a reaction out of people and I'm scared this is going to become one of those jokes.

1.

2. I've got Borderline as well, and he keeps insisting that my ""sudden"" gender issues are just a symptom of that. I've been struggling with gender issues for ever, but was presenting as hyper fem when we met. I've never brought up the gender issues, because honestly I just shoved it all under the childhood sexual trauma umbrella, and he is taking that as it was never an issue until now. 
3. Our life is super hectic; we live on a boat, are pretty broke, and have a packed social life, so he keeps guilting me about ""adding more to our plate"".
4. Keeps saying that ""he didn't sign up to be dating a little boy""  I've tried to explain genderfluidity to him, and how I feel I fit into that specifically, but it never ends well. Anytime I try to get him to read stuff it turns into an argument. 
5. Keeps saying ""he doesn't know who I am"" anymore.

I know an obvious solution here is to end things, but he and I have stayed together through a lot of awful shit related to my other mental health issues, so I'm really reluctant to let this be the straw that broke the camels back.

Not just of others, but society is so freaking binary that if I see a gender-ambiguous person, my brain--it feels like, not *me*, but my *brain*\--feels confusion and a need to study them and ""figure out"" their gender. As an AFAB agender person who is regularly trying to not fit in a binary perception box (see pic!) I find it especially frustrating that I can't shut down the part of my brain that wants to put *everyone else* in binary perception boxes.

I know it's been trained into us hard, so much so that we gender stories that don't even need to be gendered, ya know, ""when I was at the store, this lady was..."" or ""so this guy on the subway..."" and ""this kid at the park, she's probably like five, right, and...""

Why are so many of these trans narratives so damn relatable?"" (Answers: yes, probably, and because some nonbinary people are also trans)

But I want to share something that might be helpful to other people starting their journey: dysphoria sucks, and while going down the rabbit hole of your past is kind of a necessary part of the process, it's extremely stressful and draining. 

But you know what's AMAZING? Gender euphoria. So I decided that I'm going to try to focus on what gives me that feeling, and let that be my guide. I started making a list of things that give me gender euphoria, as well as a list of things that I think might do so. I'm AFAB and really only now exploring my ""male"" side, so a lot of these are pretty masculine-coded:

**Things that give me male or non-binary gender euphoria:**

* Being referred to by ""they/them"" pronouns. (wowowowow, I did not expect this to feel so euphoric. I thought I didn't care about pronouns. I was wrong.)
* How my broad shoulders and small-ish boobs look in men's button-down shirts.
* Wearing this one button-down shirt that, due to the cut, makes me look flat-chested when I wear it. (THIS was a surprise)
* Man-spreading instead of sitting with my legs together (have only done this at home, not on the subway!)
* The fact that my speaking voice is low but my singing voice is a high soprano (very non-binary!)
* Connecting with other non-binary people, or binary trans people in early stages of transition, and feeling really connected to them.
* My big, blocky glasses

**Things I want to try:**

* Interested in binding, but going to start with a small sports bra
* Packing? (this seems scary but also really ... interesting)
* Wearing men's underwear
* Cutting my hair short (it's long and blonde and immediately marks me as a feminine woman)

Then I wanted to honor my female side, so I thought about **gender euphoria I've gotten from female things:**

* Female friendships, and feeling community with women, especially queer women
* Sometimes I love my girly hair
* Listening to good, feminine pop music, like Janelle Monae.

One of the cool things about exploring this way is that I've discovered I like things I never would have expected, like being referred to by certain pronouns, or how my shoulders look in a button-down. It's a really joyful and fun way to explore something that can be really heavy and scary.

Hello everyone,

It's  been a while since I made an update about the T+Fin combo. This post is  going to be copy and pasted from my last one and changed where there  have been changes. The purpose of these updates is to provide  information as there is hardly any out there from people who have done  it since starting T, and this is a combo a lot of people, especially  nonbinary people, are interested in. Fin is a DHT blocker which is  responsible for a lot of changes we attribute to testosterone, but not  all.

Sorry I don't have a video. I am too self-conscious to do vid updates :S

Note  that I am also on Wellbutrin (have been for a while) which is known to  affect things like libido (though usually increases it, which I did not  find to be the case for me) as well as other potential things T/Fin  might have affected, so keep that in mind.

Some  background: I started T and Fin at the same time. I'm on 50mg of T  cypionate subq weekly and 1.25mg of Fin daily. I am 5'4"" and when I  started I was 120lbs, pretty petite and very ""cute"" in a way that has  people vastly underestimate my age. I am 30 and have never passed as  male no matter what my hair and clothes are. I have pretty wide hips for  my size and smallish chest, and I'm starting out here with a figure  that wont pass as male without some physical changes. My starting voice  was pretty high and pretty west coast and difficult to throw lower.

What I wanted from T: voice, muscles, change in body shape, and a better self image, more energy

What  I didn't want: body hair, facial hair, losing hair, bottom growth, high  sex drive, the supposed thicker feeling skin? That's kind of whatever  but I like my skin how it is. Being smelly. Acne.

Anyway  so with all that in mind here is what has happened over 9 months on  T+Fin. I started in 8/6/18. My latest T levels are in normal male range.

**Hair**

* No  significant change in body hair. The actual hairs haven't gotten  thicker/darker, nor has much more of it appeared. Possibly more on my  legs, though I usually shaved and now I haven't so I'm not entirely sure  how it compares to what it would have been before without shaving. But I  think it's a little more. Arm hair has not changed at all. There might  be a tiny bit more on my stomach but not enough that it looks  'masculine'.
* No facial hair at all.
* Head  hair has not changed. I dont notice much more of a masculine hairline,  but I also naturally already had a pretty masculine hairline.

**Voice**

My  speaking voice is lower, at an androgynous level. It's not so much  lower that people always comment about it or ask about it but it's  definitely a lot lower than it was. I don't think it sounds male exactly  but I think that has more to do with the quality than the depth and I  could probably work on it to make it sound more male. I don't think I'm  going to until I start visually passing more and have top surgery. I can  sing many notes lower than I could when I started, but I still can hit  most of the high notes I started with also which is unusual. I can still  sing in my head voice. It's possibly even improved in sound because  it's more resonant. Weird. I haven't had much cracking exactly, but for  several months it felt kind of uneven to talk. It's a little better now  though still sounds kind of funny sometimes. Somewhere in the middle of  my range, the transition between my headvoice and not when singing was  kind of sketchy depending on where I tried to switch. I assume my voice  is not done doing what it's gonna do.

**Body**

* I  have noticeably larger arm muscles and shoulder muscle/trapezius, calf  muscles. I don't work out though my job is slightly physical. I notice  new muscles occasionally I never noticed before. I can do 10 normal push  ups now while doing even 1 before was difficult. Yay. I should actually  lift some weights one of these days.
* I think there's been bottom growth but I don't think it would make someone look twice if someone were to see it.
* Period  is... annoying. Two months ago it was weird. Then it skipped a month  but I had cramps from hell that I've never experienced before. Then I  had it as normal the next time which made me pissed off. So T is  definitely affecting it, but it's not entirely getting the memo. My doc  things if i took a larger dose every other week, it would stop it. I  might switch to that and see how I feel about the high/low.
* As  for libido. I am ace and my libido has always been pretty minimal. At  this point its like. Mentally it feels kind of high especially for me,  but physically its still kind of eh! Like my interest is much higher but  my actual physical response isn't really that high. And if I'm doing  other things in the day I don't really think about it. It's really only  when I start getting bored.
* I  don't think I've had a dramatic change in my physique/fat distribution  yet which isn't that surprising given that I don't do any cardio. My arm  muscles have made several of my smallest shirts not fit anymore, like  at all. I still have a small waist. I've gained about 10 lbs so am now  around 128-130. I wear the same pants size--I assume its muscle weight  (or maybe water weight as they say). I don't think I look any heavier.
* Body  smell is not significant. If I wear my normal deoderant its a nonissue.  The smell of nether regions is like. I guess different? I'm not a fan  of it but its not nearly as bad as some people here describe.
* Acne  has been irritating. But I have struggled with it as an adult so much  that I had been on low dose accutane on and off for a while, and was for  the first month or two on T but then got off. THey're definitely  annoying but not horrific.
* No changes in hands or feet.
* Face  looks mostly the same, but the jaw has gotten more defined. The muscles  of my jaw are much easier to feel. But I still don't really pass lol.
* Skin feels the same.
* Energy  level is the same for the most part, although I find the physical  aspect of running to be much easier. Sadly I still get asthma attacks so  I dont do it.
* Appetite is the same.
* At  3 months I said: ""A lot warmer, sweat more easily, get cold less."" Well  either I got used to that as my new normal or it kind of went away  cause I feel like all that is basically the same as it always was again  now. Maybe still get cold a tiny bit less easily but meh.

**Mental:**

* I  haven't noticed any significant changes in how I feel mentally or  emotionally. I cry at the same level as before. Everything like that  feels the same.
* I think I'm a little sleepier.
* Slowly  getting more comfortable with idea of some of the things I didn't want  happening. But I don't know that I actually want them.

I don't pass. As far as I know my voice hasn't passed on the phone.

I dont notice much more of a masculine hairline,  but I also naturally already had a pretty masculine hairline.\n\n**Voice**\n\nMy  speaking voice is lower, at an androgynous level. It\'s not so much  lower that people always comment about it or ask about it but it\'s  definitely a lot lower than it was. I don\'t think it sounds male exactly  but I think that has more to do with the quality than the depth and I  could probably work on it to make it sound more male. I don\'t think I\'m  going to until I start visually passing more and have top surgery. I can  sing many notes lower than I could when I started, but I still can hit  most of the high notes I started with also which is unusual. I can still  sing in my head voice. It\'s possibly even improved in sound because  it\'s more resonant. Weird. I haven\'t had much cracking exactly, but for  several months it felt kind of uneven to talk. It\'s a little better now  though still sounds kind of funny sometimes. Somewhere in the middle of  my range, the transition between my headvoice and not when singing was  kind of sketchy depending on where I tried to switch. I assume my voice  is not done doing what it\'s gonna do.\n\n**Body**\n\n* I  have noticeably larger arm muscles and shoulder muscle/trapezius, calf  muscles. I don\'t work out though my job is slightly physical. I notice  new muscles occasionally I never noticed before. I can do 10 normal push  ups now while doing even 1 before was difficult. Yay. I should actually  lift some weights one of these days.\n* I think there\'s been bottom growth but I don\'t think it would make someone look twice if someone were to see it.\n* Period  is... annoying. Two months ago it was weird. Then it skipped a month  but I had cramps from hell that I\'ve never experienced before. Then I  had it as normal the next time which made me pissed off. So T is  definitely affecting it, but it\'s not entirely getting the memo. My doc  things if i took a larger dose every other week, it would stop it. I  might switch to that and see how I feel about the high/low.\n* As  for libido. I am ace and my libido has always been pretty minimal. At  this point its like. Mentally it feels kind of high especially for me,  but physically its still kind of eh! Like my interest is much higher but  my actual physical response isn\'t really that high. And if I\'m doing  other things in the day I don\'t really think about it. It\'s really only  when I start getting bored.\n* I  don\'t think I\'ve had a dramatic change in my physique/fat distribution  yet which isn\'t that surprising given that I don\'t do any cardio. My arm  muscles have made several of my smallest shirts not fit anymore, like  at all. I still have a small waist. I\'ve gained about 10 lbs so am now  around 128-130. I wear the same pants size--I assume its muscle weight  (or maybe water weight as they say). I don\'t think I look any heavier.\n* Body  smell is not significant. If I wear my normal deoderant its a nonissue.  The smell of nether regions is like. I guess different? I\'m not a fan  of it but its not nearly as bad as some people here describe.\n* Acne  has been irritating. But I have struggled with it as an adult so much  that I had been on low dose accutane on and off for a while, and was for  the first month or two on T but then got off. THey\'re definitely  annoying but not horrific.\n* No changes in hands or feet.\n* Face  looks mostly the same, but the jaw has gotten more defined. The muscles  of my jaw are much easier to feel. But I still don\'t really pass lol.\n* Skin feels the same.\n* Energy  level is the same for the most part, although I find the physical  aspect of running to be much easier. Sadly I still get asthma attacks so  I dont do it.\n* Appetite is the same.\n* At  3 months I said: ""A lot warmer, sweat more easily, get cold less."" Well  either I got used to that as my new normal or it kind of went away  cause I feel like all that is basically the same as it always was again  now. Maybe still get cold a tiny bit less easily but meh.\n\n**Mental:**\n\n* I  haven\'t noticed any significant changes in how I feel mentally or  emotionally. I cry at the same level as before. Everything like that  feels the same.\n* I think I\'m a little sleepier.\n* Slowly  getting more comfortable with idea of some of the things I didn\'t want  happening. But I don\'t know that I actually want them.\n\nI don\'t pass. As far as I know my voice hasn\'t passed on the phone.\n\nHmm.... I can\'t really think of anything else.

2019-05-16 16:10:03,bpegh2,10,8,"Hello folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I came out as nonbinary this year and have recently started low dose (20mg...yay!) T. I have also started introducing myself as Kitten rather than Katie (the nickname my parents gave me that I've never really liked but always gone by. My full name is Katherine, which I also don't like these days because of how gendered it is. I like Kitten...it was given to me by my old camp friends and is special to me.

2019-05-16 18:04:02,bpfur8,29,29,"Hi there all you lovely people. I have an honest question that's playing quite a lot into a powerful feeling for me. A little background: I'm a 29 year old amab, I wear dresses and skirts and makeup. I feel quite strongly drawn to identifying as a non binary person. It appeals to what I feel I am and how I want to present myself.

I feel a big part of what I find attractive about being nonbinary is that it could be a rejection of ""being a man"". That is, I have a huge problem with how ""men"" as a whole are, and act. I hate pervasive toxic masculinity. There's an awful lot about men, and being a man, that I dislike and want to distance myself from personally. In a sense I want to make a statement that I'm _choosing_ not to identify as that. That there are other ways to be.

I have a worry about that though, that it might be somehow offensive to other nonbinary people. I think that's based on a worry that for most people it's much more a positive statement of ""there's a thing called nonbinary which I am sure I am in my core"" rather than ""I choose to identify as nonbinary because I reject the binary genders, especially the one I was born presenting as"".

Can't dress femme. Not often. Formalities only. Feels wrong. Can I make it feel right?
Just need to embrace the femininity.

Yes, brain. Deal with it - woman. You've lasted this long after all, where did these thoughts even come from? On what grounds? You've got bigger fish to fry. Just quit this obsessing. That's all it is. Obsessing.
Just stop it. Picture telling people. Yeah, exactly. So shut up, brain. I'm not a fan either.
Non binary is for other people. You're cis. Even if you're not cis, non binary is for other people. Even if you're ftm, transitioning is for other people. People that actually care about that gender stuff. You don't really care. Not really. Not nearly enough, that's for sure.

2019-05-17 19:46:41,bpvsy9,2,3,"Hi everyone,

My background: 28 AMAB, hated masculine clothing etc when I was young, GID from teenage years. Lots of dysphoria in college, thought I was trans but saw a therapist and worked into realizing I would be better off just avoiding overtly masculine and feminine things and clothing in general and shooting for androgyny (hated wearing dresses also).  Generally happier since then, especially since I met my partner. However, still have kind of a persistent OCD about gender sans major emotional dysphoria.

My conflict: On one hand non binary describes my feelings in relationships with people intensely, as I don't feel a male/female duality and aggressively avoid it.  When I meet androgynous or even subtly not binary minded individuals I feel like I connect with them much better.  I kind of want to say ""I am non binary"" to have an upfront label for that feeling, and because I like that it creates an overt way for people who feel this way to communicate and assemble.

On the other hand, I don't feel the need to reject my sex.  If someone wanted to see me as an exemplar male person, I'd be happy with that, just like if someone thought of me as an exemplar New Yorker or an exemplar white person or whatever other identity is relevant.  It's just no more binary in nature than these other identities to me, and not associated with masc/femme feelings for sure.  I don't deny that having a male body hugely effects my life experience and I feel that rejecting that fact is just shirking responsibility.

I have some body dysphoria in the ""I want to be more androgynous and pretty"" direction but it's not much more than the average person has in any other direction at this point either, except for maybe 10% of the time it's pretty bad.

I'm NB-ish MtF transitioning and I've been going through a very odd series of identity crises, and a lot of it having to do with me not wanting to rid myself of the labels I used to use ""pre-transition"" like gay. I like the idea of being in a gay ""boy"" relationship but I still personally identify with no real gender at all. My body looks female, my style is androgynous, yet I stick to this. I'm just looking for maybe a different viewpoint on this topic because I've made posts in the past on MtF-based subreddits before.

I guess what I'm asking here is: have any of you experienced this, or if not, does it feel odd to you? (like, should I be looking deeper into my idea of what my gender really is)? Also, do you personally believe that someone who transitions physically from MtF can still have times where they feel like they're more ""male"" gendered than others? It seems to move back and forth quite a bit, and I just don't know how this will impact my transition. Sometimes I get scared and think I should stop transition entirely, but I still know that at some point(s) in my life I do feel female too.

2019-05-18 23:48:04,bqag23,17,22,"I'm having a rough time.

Background: my partner and I have been together for 15 years. Both AFAB, androgynous people who are queer identified and sort of immersed in lesbian culture, but express discomfort with being identified as ""lesbian"" or ""butch."" We are both also deeply uncomfortable in ""women's spaces,"" or with traditionally feminine things. Last summer, my partner came out as NB. It made sense, I was on board, everything was fine. Until they told me they were planning to have top surgery.

Cue meltdown.

More background: I full-on hate my body. Especially my breasts. I've been referring to them as ""bags of pain"" since I hit puberty. I am convinced they're just lying in wait to be cancer. I hate the way they look, and despite being somewhat uh... buxom, I wear S sports bras or bind (though binding causes other dysphoria for me).

My voice dysphoria is much improved, which was the goal of testosterone in the first place. But I also feel like I don't sound that different, and other people who know me say I don't sound that different. Which is true! Testosterone doesn't make you sound like a different person, it just puts your voice in a different place a little bit or something.

Being nonbinary the best I can hope for is strangers getting confused about my gender, like ""hello sir, I mean ma'am, I mean... er..."" or just half of people gendering me male and half gendering me female.

2019-05-21 01:00:25,br3xlw,8,4,"Just found this sub last week, sorry I‚Äôm late to the party!

I‚Äôve been out as nonbinary or bigender in some form or another for 14ish years. I‚Äôm finally in the position to have  top surgery next month. I decided on my look months ago (alone) with the surgeon. I went to the pre-op appointment with my wife last week and showed her the photo of what I was thinking of getting.

There was some whispered arguing between us in the office and that made me tell the surgeon that I needed to look at more images because I‚Äôm a bit confused. I‚Äôm sure that pissed the surgeon off‚Äî to change horses mid-stream, so to speak. Anyhow...

I was trying to, I don‚Äôt know, save face or something when my wife had an adverse reaction to the chest image I showed her. A few days later, she told me she cried in private over my decision because I apparently led her to believe I was choosing a smaller female chest instead of a male chest.. (I never really considered that there was a difference before?!? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and that she‚Äôs not attracted to male chests or really even small chests because she thinks of them as belonging to little girls instead.

I..... don‚Äôt know what to do with this information now.

She applauded the fact that I am finally aligning my outer image to the inner image I have of myself so she‚Äôs okay with the surgery itself and my need for it. So that‚Äôs not the issue really.. just the appearance of that final result.

I am decidedly both genders because I am one extreme externally and the other extreme internally. I feel that I would have worse dysphoria if I were to fully transition‚Äî hence getting only top surgery to fix the worst of my dysphoria.

I‚Äôm in the position that I‚Äôd rather have a female chest albeit way smaller than a male if it helps keep that part of my relationship alive. There is no ‚Äúfinding someone else‚Äù for me. She‚Äôs my person and has been that way for a very long time.

So here‚Äôs where I need an ask... currently a DD, is it possible to get down to an A or small B and still present as male when I want to? I currently have a microfiber concealer crew binder from Underworks.. it cuts my dysphoria by like 25% or so most days. Does anyone have experiences similar to what I‚Äôm trying to do? How and where did you find model chests to show to your surgeon? I want to be able to no longer need to wear a bra and to look male or at least androgynous when wearing a binder instead of butch. It‚Äôs not how I see myself or ID as, frankly.

My surgery is June 12th so it‚Äôs a massive change needing to happen under a deadline. I‚Äôve looked at some niche porn sites for women with almost flat chests to try to find a compromise image. Wanting to see if there are other corners of the internet I‚Äôm not looking in.

Hey, I live in Northern Europe and I'm still questioning (Idk if I'm nb, a trans guy or just a butch lesbian), but I really want a binder because my chest makes me feel like shit most of the time.

I don't know a lot about binding, but I was thinking maybe someone who's done it could help me figure out what's best for me.

I'm relatively tall (5'8"") and skinny and my chest is probably a C or a B cup, so not too big. The summer is gonna be warm and I tend to sweat a lot, which I'm afraid might make binding hell. I usually wear sports bras to work and they make my chest less prominent, but not flat, and I'd like to be flat.

I've been considering getting a binder from Dana√´, since they're based in the Netherlands, but I can't decide whether I should get their sports binder or their regular short binder.

My main concern with the sports binder is that it won't make me flat.

My main concern with the short binder is that I'll sweat too much and my breathing will be restricted (although I don't tend to wear it whan I'm at home, so I can restrict myself to 8 hours a day).

Idk which one would be healthiest to wear, the sports binder or the short binder, but it's important to me that I don't damage my spine, lungs, whatever else may be at risk when binding.

The sports binder is here: https://www.trans-missie.com/en/sport-binder-budget.html

The short binder is here: https://www.trans-missie.com/en/basic-binder-budget.html

I've also been considering getting a spectrum binder: https://spectrumoutfitters.co.uk/products/black-short-binder?variant=15857211506731

2019-05-22 16:15:01,brqph4,8,13,"[Here](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/) is the article for those interested. There's a lot more info unrelated to gender, but I'm just gonna share some highlights I found particularly interesting.

Generations are defined by birth years as follows: **Silent Generation -** 1928-1945; **Boomers -** 1946-1964; **Gen X -** 1965-1980; **Millennials -** 1981-1996; **Gen Z -** 1997-?

On whether forms should offer options other than male and female: 59% of Gen Zers, 50% of Millennials, 40% of Gen Xers, 37% of Boomers, and 32% of the Silent Gen say they should. 

On personally knowing someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns: 35% of Gen Zers, 25% of Millennials, 16% of Gen Xers, 12% of Boomers, and 7% of the Silent Gen do.

On how comfortable they feel using neutral pronouns for someone (V = Very; S = Somewhat): Gen Z - 32% V/25% S; Millennials - 31% V/28% S; Gen X - 25% V/24% S; Boomer - 24% V/26% S; Silent Gen - 18% V/21% S. ""Across generations, knowing someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns is linked to comfort levels in using these pronouns. ... Those who don‚Äôt know someone are roughly 20 percentage points less likely to say the same.""

The article mentions that there is a sharp divide along party lines for all these numbers, as one would expect.

""Across generations, knowing someone who goes by gender-neutral pronouns is linked to comfort levels in using these pronouns. ...

I'm turning 16 in a little over a month, which is still kind of mind boggling. I didn't really think that I'd make it this far in all honesty. I first realized I might be trans when I was like 12, maybe 13. I told myself then that I'd come out when I was 16. It just seemed so far away and almost impossible. 

I was scared and I worried that it was a phase or that I was faking because my dysphoria wasn't as severe/the same as other trans people I knew. Keep in mind this was roughly 2015-2016 when those helicopter gender memes were pretty big. I became more certain that I didn't feel like a girl but it felt like everything around me was seeing that as a joke. I kept seeing cis people, and worse, trans people, online saying that afab people my age were faking being trans for attention.

I kind of internalized that, I guess, because even though every person whose told me they're trans or nonbinary is valid to me I still feel like a fraud. I still worry that when (if) I come out, someone will tell me I'm wrong, or worse, I'll realize it was just a phase. I came to the conclusion a while ago that I'm not happy as a girl, but if I have to, I guess I can survive as one. 

It's weird, because I know logically that not many will reject me. I'm a GSA vice president at school, I'm out to my parents as pansexual, I'm in an LGBTQ youth chorus, most of my friends are LGBT. Despite this I'm still terrified of telling anyone more than the 2 people who know now (my best friend and my nb girlfriend).

This is getting long, I'll try to get to the point.

However if they ask what I identify as I haven‚Äôt been able to answer and if they ask if I want to transition to female I get uncomfortable and want to say no, because even though I want to get on hormones which is basically what they‚Äôre asking it just feel *wrong* to say I‚Äôm transitioning to female


I‚Äôve taken a liking to the term ‚Äúdemigirl‚Äù  because it pins down what I‚Äôm feeling a lot better then ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù

Even though I have some legitimate reasons to think demigirl might be accurate I can‚Äôt help but feel there‚Äôs at least a small chance that it‚Äôs imposter syndrome about being female and I don‚Äôt want to play into the idea that NB people are just confused and will eventually fall to either side.

This could also just be imposter syndrome about being NB.


So I either have the option of feeling like a fake girl with a chance of turning out NB.

Or feeling like a fake NB with a chance of turning out as a girl.


I feel like the latter has a lot bigger chance to to turn out to be harmful so maybe I should go with the former to be safe(it would make more sense to the cis as well, might make thing easier) but the fact is currently I feel uncomfortable stating I‚Äôm a binary trans girl even if that turns out to be accurate.

So I took testosterone (low dose) for a while, and about a week ago I stopped because my voice is at an androgynous pitch and I don't want it to get more masculine.

Taking testosterone was really good for my genital dysphoria too!

The endocrinologist told me that genital changes are permanent, but I feel like if trans women experience genital changes on oestrogen then he is not giving me the full story, you know?

Testosterone was so good for me, and I'm nervous that modern medicine only really knows about people who start testosterone and then *don't stop*. What if my endocrinologist just didn't have enough information and couldn't warn me? My catastrophising brain is worried that since having a clitoris was so bad for me (ugh I can barely type that I had a clitoris at all), if I stop T then I'll somehow end up with the worst of both worlds, worse than before I started T in the first place.

I think about the couple of times I've been read as a guy and I wonder how many times it would take for that to feel natural and comfortable, or if it never would. There used to be a time when I would count and could tell you exactly how many times I'd been called 'he' within a certain time period. At some point I lost count, and I was proud of that for some reason. I felt that it was some sort of amusing noteworthy achievement to get read as a guy.

I think about the time when I loved reading and writing gay male fanfiction with my friend's, and the deep embarrassment that set in for that afterwards. I remember dressing up as 'a gay guy' once as a joke for no good reason, and loving it. I would ask if my friends thought I would make a good gay guy. I thought it was all a joke. An embarrassing one, looking back. Yet I remember at the same time feeling very uncomfortable with my friend's love of effeminate guys in media, especially those that looked so effeminate they could be mistaken for women. That friend later came out as NB.

I never seriously considered the idea that I was anything other than...what I was. I didn't control my clothing choices until I was 18 pretty much and even after for quite a while I didn't have the money to change from the clothes my mum bought me. I just assumed my body, terrible fashion sense and or lack of practice and agency were responsible for my uncomfortable feelings. I knew I didn't enjoy clothes shopping much anyway, it was boring. And I liked pleasing, impressing or surprising people with the times I really put more effort into looking femme.

And now I still think all of that still holds weight, and those 'normal' explanations still work. I still feel that I never hated my body, or if I sometimes did it wasn't for those reasons. I can't say that the first trans story I ever saw gave me a lightbulb moment in any way. I feel pretty okay with the pros and cons of my gender social role. Which is why I feel my confusion leaves me as NB, if anything.

If anything. Probably nothing. I just wonder why, then, I've always felt reluctant to type the words, way back from when putting pronouns on your profile became a kind of trend. Who needs to know? I thought. It's the Internet.

2019-05-27 05:02:35,bthwzd,5,3,"S'pose I'll give y'all a little background about why I'd do this.

I'm like 75% sure I'm a binary trans guy. Idk it's only been a few months since I seriously started thinking about this. Basically the only thing that stopped me from being actively suicidal since thinking about all this has been realizing I can be a man who presents as a woman, which has taken so much of the pressure off about passing (which I will never be able to do because I am tiny).

What this means practically is that I am out to 1 person as a guy, and ask him to use he/him in private and she/her in public. There's 1 other person who has been along this journey with me, and I haven't necessarily come out to him with a label, but I have asked him to use they/them and she/her pronouns for me in public but in private if he slips in a he/him that would be cool. When people ask my pronouns, I mostly give she/her but if I feel safe say she/they.

I'm out as queer, ace, and/or bi to most people. I also feel like it's pretty obvious that I bind, and might be obvious that I pack sometimes. I go by an androgynous version of my birthname.

There's 1 other person who has been along this journey with me, and I haven't necessarily come out to him with a label, but I have asked him to use they/them and she/her pronouns for me in public but in private if he slips in a he/him that would be cool.

I have always been very feminine and have identified strongly with androgyny. Over the past year this has evolved for me into feelings of wanting to transition towards a more androgynous or non-binary physicality, to prevent further masculinization associated with aging.

However - I had gyncomastia surgery when I was 15, which is the equivalent to top surgery for a FtM individual, or a double mastectomy. As I identify more with androgyny than I do with traditional womanhood, I feel breasts or nipple enlargement would be an unwanted side effect for me of HRT.

Everything else associated with estrogen I am at peace with, and therefor am curious if anyone has had similar experiences, or information on the matter? I have found dubious results online.

But so yeah narratives like this make me think things to myself like ""wow you're such a woman"" (like not in a deragatory way against women but just in a ""*sigh* do we HAVE to think about gender again fuck"" )
So I wonder... How much of these narratives are true and how much do narratives in themselves affect how we percieve our own emotion? I'm pretty sure it's scientific canon what my friend says about estrogen-based and testosterone-based anger. But it kind of stresses me out a little bit. Maybe it's bc people, my friend included, equals testosterone with man and estrogen with women, and absorbs me into this narrative.

I am AFAB with an estrogen-based hormonesystem and a lot of times I see myself as a gay guy. (I\'m nonbinary) But I totally like the estrogenbased version of anger I was told better.... I\'m not sure it always applies too me tho... I feel like a little mix of everything... When I\'m angry I can feel like the the frickin avatar getting their blue shine on.

How much of these narratives are true and how much do narratives in themselves affect how we percieve our own emotion? I\'m pretty sure it\'s scientific canon what my friend says about estrogen-based and testosterone-based anger. But it kind of stresses me out a little bit. Maybe it\'s bc people, my friend included, equals testosterone with man and estrogen with women, and absorbs me into this narrative.\n\nI honestly just want your genuine reflection on all this. If somebody can remind me why it\'s not reasonable to equate t with man and e with woman that would be great too.

2019-05-29 04:56:27,buah3c,16,8,"I'm 24 years old and biologically female with PCOS. So I have wacky hormones and have higher testosterone. I have broader shoulders, above average muscle, and hair all over my body. I shave so that I don't have a mustache and stubble on my chin. Physically I feel like I'm stuck in between two genders. Not female or male. Since elementary school though and as early as I can remember, I've wanted to be male. I would prefer to hang out with guys and dress masculine. In video games I would choose male characters. My favorite movie as a kid was Mulan because she dressed as male and acted masculine. From that I became a bit obsessed with the gender bender topic. And read manga and watched dramas like Hana Kimi and Ouran High School Host Club. When I hit puberty I hated having breasts and would try to flatten them as much as I could.  By wearing sports bras. Sometimes I would wear two sports bras at once to make them flatter. I hated wearing makeup and dressing feminine. It felt like I was in drag. When I'd take pics of myself I would hide my hair under a cap (because my mom wouldn't let me cut it) and take pics so that my chest wouldn't show. I never masturbate as a female. I hate having a female body. I'm pansexual so I'm attracted to females, but I don't like being one. When I watch porn (often gay porn), I like placing myself in a male point of view. I imagine myself with a dick and fucking someone. I'm too shy to ask out girls in person (only dated online), but I've dated guys who think of me as a tomboy. I like feminine submissive guys who I can dominate. Such as by playing with their nipples, spanking, rimming and fingering their asshole. But I find myself wishing I could fuck them. I don't really like being touched in a sexual way. It feels really uncomfortable to me and I only do it to please my partner. Receiving anal sex causes less dysphoria than vaginal. Idk if I'd be considered non binary or not. I play this online chatting game often where I have a male avatar. I use a male name and feel happy and comfortable being treated as male and not as female. When I voice call people online, I try to deepen my voice. I'd never be able to go through transitioning to male in real life though. I feel like if I were to get surgery, that it's not scientifically advanced enough for me to be satisfied with it. Also that I would lose my family and my chances of dating. My mom has actually tried making me more of a normal female, by putting me on progesterone. To reduce the body hair and make my periods more regular. But I reacted really badly to it (depression) and felt like I was losing who I was. But I don't know what I am. I know I hate being treated as and referred to as female. But I'm not completely sure if I want to be referred to as male. I honestly just want to be treated as a human.

JT here - this is my first reddit post ever. I'm 29, AFAB, non-binary leaning masc as far as my presentation to the world. I have a very feminine body that makes me super self conscious that I try to hide with my clothes by wearing slim fit pants and big shirts. My chest and hips are a huge source of dysphoria for me. I work out regularly to try and masculinize my body, but I work long hours and it would take years and years of intense body building to create the vision I have for myself.  I have a girlfriend of almost 4 years who I ""came out"" to yesterday as far as wanting to ""microdose"" T for a more androgynous presentation. She is super supportive - more than I would/could have even hoped for. I guess I am looking for some guidance/suggestions because I have been going back and forth about HRT for a while now. I would love to have a stronger jaw, lower voice, slimmer hips, and wider shoulder/back. I don't want facial hair and am pretty terrified of bottom growth. I fear that bottom growth could potentially cause more dysphoria leaning the other direction for me. (Disclaimer - I know I can't pick and choose the changes I will get). I am going back and forth about either getting a reduction for my chest or top surgery. I'm super uncomfortable / concerned about the locker room situation at the gym and bathrooms if I do end up getting top surgery (there is no family or gender neutral locker room at Crunch). Lastly, my partner really wants a family and I would like to have the option to use my own egg (I've tossed around the idea of asking my brother to use his sperm to inseminate her egg that way we could have a kid with both our genetics, but I feel that asking him this could potentially force a ""yes"" that he doesn't really mean/want - thoughts here?).

2019-05-29 17:36:25,buhnu0,0,1,"Hey guys. I need some help proofreading some text for a comic I'm going to illustrate. If you have any critiques or thoughts please feel free to share!

-----

I'm by far and away the furthest thing from an expert on the subject, I've only been out and experimenting with my gender for the past year. But I do have some thoughts that I'd like to put out there for anyone who lives in accordance with a binary existence and have difficulty understanding or empathizing with those who don't.

First and foremost, I'd like to share a quote from the Dark Mother herself:
""If you still want to insist on strictly binary sexual categories, then you're trying to force reality to fit your preconceived conceptual scheme instead of adapting your concepts to fit reality. And that is what bad science looks like.""
What is Gender? - ContraPoints

In my previous post, I was asked a question by a little kid at work: are you a boy or a girl?

The quickest and easiest way I could answer the question was by responding, I am both. But that's not capturing the full truth, it's a lie by omission and defining my gender as ""both male and female"" could be taken as a passive and yet harmful conformity to the gender binary, to which I myself do not live by, and which many nonbinary people are working to dismantle.

What I mean by that is, there are so many unnecessarily gendered things that reinforce the binary. Pink for girls, blue for boys, ""girls clothes"" vs ""boys clothes"", gendered bath products, children's toys, sports and which ones boys can play vs girls, the list goes on. Just go to the store and count how many products are labelled ""for men"" when they shouldn't be and you'll start to see what I mean.

I think another reason this might be is because of a common definition and understanding for what it means to be a man, and how most men are desperately seeking ways to reinforce their masculinity so as to not seem ""gay"" or feminine. But that's a topic for another time.

What I really want to talk about is defining gender, more specifically what my gender means to me. The problem is, when you begin to define things, you stick them in a rigid box and it becomes unadaptable, one definition for a single word won't fit everyone's existence.

So what IS gender? Gender is... Whatever you want it to be, based on your own understanding and how you want to define it for yourself. It's as simple as that.

I realize not many people like that explanation. They want hard answers, answers that most nonbinary people can't really give because we live so ambiguously and our definitions are going to vary person to person.

The thing to take away from this is, no one really owes anyone an answer. It's probably for the best to stop expecting one because of how rapidly society changes and chooses to define things, define what is masculine or feminine or anything else for that matter.

Our brains like binary systems instead of spectrums because they're rigid and easy to define. People want to see black and white, not shades of gray. Hence why my androgynous presence is confusing to kids because they can't easily read me as male or female, which they are growing up to believe is the only way a human can exist.

Why are we even trying to push arbitrary definitions on people's behaviors and personal styles? Why am I read as a female for painting my nails, or a male for the way I act and speak? We're all indoctrinated into the binary at birth based on our sex organs, but psychologically speaking my brain is very much not ""male"" OR ""female"". I can't even say for certain if it is both, or neither. It's ambivalent at the most and I can't really pinpoint what it is or what it means.

What I can define though are ways that I personally DO subscribe to binary characteristics, and I choose to do so based on my presentation. Presentation is communication.
Some days, I wish to be read as strictly female, so I dress as such and by doing so it makes me feel pretty, delicate, captivating, and feminine.
When I choose to present as male, it makes me feel respected, strong, courageous, and masculine.
When I present androgynously, it makes me feel the most like myself - right in the middle, a perfect balance of my favourite attributes where I feel right at home in my body.

These feelings are not inherently female or male, and feelings shouldn't be gendered in the first place as feelings are abstract concepts. A boy can feel pretty, and a girl can feel courageous. What I'm trying to say is these are definitions I've gathered and made for myself, how I choose to present, and what my psyche needs to thrive for the day. Some days I just wanna be a soft flower and other days I feel like I need the power of a jacked gladiator ready for battle.

I notice myself still giving feminine and masculine attributes to things that others would probably criticize me for doing, but that's because I've defined these things for myself. Men, women, and nonbinary people can all feel like flowers or like an entire Roman army,  it's completely up to them on how they choose to define it. This is why defining gender is so difficult, it's completely up to the individual.

The easiest way I've discovered to define myself is by the things I am not. I am not female. I am not male. I've taken a liking to calling myself a Femboy, but that's still not completely encapsulating the full truth. I'm not really seeking to define it, because I personally like distinguishing who I am based on what I'm not. It leaves a whole lot more room for change and interpretation, which is way more fun anyways. I live for the confused look on people's faces when they're trying to clock me and can't figure out how to treat me or talk to me based on my gender.

So I made an audio recording of my female voice using my phone and was hoping I could get some feedback. Having been born with male physiology makes it kind of difficult to talk like a girl, especially since I‚Äôve only been questioning for a couple of years and working on my voice for a short few months. 

The clip is about two minutes long so I think it gives a pretty good depiction of what it‚Äôs like after working on it for a little. 

If you have any tips or constructive criticism I would really like to hear it. Thanks so much.

This post talks about breast problems. I don't know if this is a sensitive topic for anyone, but this is a heads up just in case. 

Agender, AFAB.  I'm sorry if this is a little long winded. It's been something that has bothered and worried me a lot for several years, and I don't know what to do about it. 

 When puberty hit, I detested what was happening to my body. One of the worst parts was having my breasts grow in. At the same time, my weight exploded, and I gained at least 100lbs within a few months. To make matters worse, even if my weight had been under control, given my genetics, I would probably have had large breasts anyway.  My mom constantly picked on me for their size, and at the same time, she was incapable of understanding that mine were larger than hers were at that age.  Because of this, she forced me to wear bras that were several sizes too small, even as it was obvious that my chest was only getting larger.  At first it wasn't too bad, but as time went on, it hurt more and more, especially on the sides of my breasts, and I had trouble breathing.  I stopped going outside, because I was allowed to go without a bra in the house, unless she got a bee in her bonnet about how big they were, and I would wear one for as long as I could stand, then take it off again.  It was a couple of years before I was allowed to look for ones that were a different size, and then they all hurt.

At one point, I even went to a custom bra fitter, who measured me, and had me try things on, but said that the sides of my breasts were too sensitive for any bras that she knew of, and to just keep wearing the sleeping bras and hope for the best.

Now, about ten years later, _any_ bra still hurts, and it feels like my breathing is being constricted. I have trouble exercising in even a lightweight spandex sleeping bra.  I get dizzy and out of breath faster than I would if I didn't wear one at all. But, if I go without a bra, my chest is large enough that it is _very_ noticeable, and some people treat me like trash if they see it (I've already had earfuls from some family members, and others tried to quietly get me to change habits). Because of this, I usually still go out in one, even though it hurts and makes it harder to breathe.

Much of my body dysphoria centers around my chest, and the idea of wearing a binder sounds like a good solution, but I worry that if I can't wear a bra, I'm probably not going to be able to wear that either.  The closest thing to a binder that I have, is a very lightweight spandex tank top, which just sort of holds the breasts down a tiny bit. It doesn't really make my chest look flat, and the outline of my chest is still very obvious, so people can very clearly see that I'm not wearing a bra. It only helps a tiny bit, but it's more comfortable than a bra, and I can breathe better.


The end result is, the sides of my breasts nearest my armpits are exceedingly easy to bruise, and become sore even if I wear a sleeping bra. Any bra feels like it is constricting my breathing, including ones that professional bra fitters say should fit. I HATE wearing bras anyway because they make the breasts stick out more. I want a flat chest, but I don't think that I can wear a binder, mostly due to constricted breathing. I can deal with breast pain, since I've had it for so long, but I need air to function. This is becoming more of an issue now, because I'm trying to exercise (partly due to other health problems) and lose some of the weight again, mostly to see if they can at least get a bit smaller.  I don't mind the feeling of exercising without a bra, but I do mind seeing my chest bounce when I do, and I dislike how poorly I am treated by some other people for doing so, when they notice.  

Yes, I have talked to a doctor about it in the past and was ignored and basically told that it was all in my head, which just made me second guess everything, hate myself more, and double down on ignoring the pain.  Even now I don't know if it is all in my head, but I know how much it hurts how I feel about myself, and I'm trying to at least improve on that.

Short backstory. I‚Äôm the parent to a 5 yo enby kiddo. We‚Äôre using non-binary as the label with the public, since they just identify as their name right now, but we‚Äôll switch if/when they find the right label for them. They never really came out.

We talked to them, and realized this was something we had to start being proactive about. We had them enrolled in a preschool, where they said they wanted us to let the teacher know they weren‚Äôt a boy or girl, and where they then faced some serious bullying from two children whose parents were actively teaching these children to misgender R. The teacher gave no support, despite when we initially interviewed the school saying she would respect R, and it was a co-op Preschool, so these parents were in charge of supervising my child way too often for their safety, so we removed them and their twin.

Im AFAB, and generally speaking I'm totally okay being identified as a girl. I still use she/her, and I am more than happy with my chest.
