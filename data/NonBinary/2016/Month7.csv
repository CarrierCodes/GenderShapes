2016-07-19 16:35:41,4tm1v8,3,7,"I don’t know if this is the right place for me to post. I’m looking for someone who can relate to this to talk to. 

As a kid I never noticed any discomfort with my body or gender. I wanted to be seen as a tomboy (I wasn’t) and hated “girly things” but that was the extent of it. When puberty started I became miserable with my body and that feeling has persisted for the 10-odd years since then. Height, breasts, hips, hand size, legs, all the things about my very feminine proportions that show that I am female make me feel disconnected and weird about my physical form. I’ve never felt much of a desire for a dick but reminders that I have a “hole” make me uncomfortable (penetration terrifies me, I can’t even put in a tampon without my body freaking out) and I am uncomfortable about my reproductive system. I dress in men’s clothes and cut my hair short but I am very rarely seen as male. When this does happen it feels good, probably because it means other people aren’t noticing all the parts of me that I hate.

I don’t have any inner sense of “gender identity” and I never have. I feel very disconnected from the word woman but I don’t have the same issue with the word female, which imo is just a biological term for what I am. When I’ve gone to college counselors (the only therapist-type people I have access to) at first they focus on identity and preferred pronouns, but I never know what to tell them. For me it’s mostly about wanting to get rid of the female features of my body. Some of the effects of testosterone are things that I don’t especially want, and I go back and forth between maybe wanting to try a low dose and not starting at all. I went to a doctor once to discuss testosterone and asked him about low dose T, but he basically scoffed in my face and said he doesn’t do “partial transitions”. I definitely want top surgery but I don’t know if someone like me would be able to get it. 

I’m open to the idea that I’m just a cis female with weird hangups, or the idea that this is somehow related to the autism that my parents have always assumed I have. I can’t relate to any trans narrative that I’ve ever heard, but when I see things about ftm transitions I feel like in some ways the people are like me. For 4-5 years I’ve been considering transition but my thoughts on it fluctuate over time. I worry how I would even explain aspects of  transition like top surgery to other people without the “I was always a boy inside” narrative, and I worry about having to live as a man socially when I don’t think that would be easier for me. At the same time I can’t see myself having a future as a woman. To be honest I just don’t know what to do, and college counselors can’t do much to help me.

2016-07-19 19:30:44,4tn0i0,6,8,"Hi folks - long time lurker on a lot of gender-related subreddits here, but first time reddit poster so bear with me haha...

Anyway, I'm a non binary MAAB art student who's thinking about creating a NB clothing line, and am looking for a bit of advice and input. I know that there's a few lines out there already, but what I've been seeing so far from places like Selfridges and Zara seems to be a samey and shapeless, tends to be pretty masculine in general and is seems quite expensive/inaccessible to your average person. The vision I've got in my head for this hypothetical line or label would be a bit more vibrant and interesting, form fitting and varied, with the aim of making it accessible to more people. I'd love for it be inclusive to all, and I know that there are also cisgender people out there that would like to have a ungendered option when it comes to shopping for clothes.

Personally in  the past I've found it pretty hard to find clothes that fit me well - I'm on the skinny side and only about 5'7-5'8 so I'm mainly left with the choice of getting something that fits really well from the women's department but might be too much on the feminine side cut or style-wise for me, or getting something with a more neutral cut or style from the men's department but having it hang off my body, so I'd like for it to be size inclusive and body positive for as many people as possible. Obviously there are practicalities to consider in terms of how many sizes of each item would be do-able as a newly started business/social enterprise, but inclusive is what I'd very much be aiming for as the core of the line.

The concept is that these are clothes for people, without boundaries, with the only separation being different kinds of cuts and styles - with the idea that one day anyone could walk into a high street store and shop in the clothes department and not feel left out or unwelcome. Anyway, that's my spiel haha, so I was wondering if anyone's got any thoughts on this idea? I'm aware that non-binary clothing isn't a new idea, and there are other things getting started up, but this isn't about rivaling them, just possibly adding my own ideas into the mix to give everybody more options to pick from.

Hey :) I've always thought of myself as a masc cis woman who loves presenting androgyously, but recently I've been thinking that maybe demigirl or another nonbinary identity might suit me better. I've never really felt that ""woman"" fully reflected my gender but I didn't really think I could find anything better and I also don't experience dysphoria generally. Over the course of my relationship with my AMAB girlfriend (yay we're coming close on 3 years), I've become increasingly aware of non-binary identities through my allyship with the trans community but I also feel that my experiences are quite different to many of the people I know well. I am not sure whether I want to change my pronouns because I like both she and they pronouns (currently use she). I like my appearance most when I appear androgynous and dislike my big boobs which are the biggest detracting factor in my opinion from the androgynous look. I like it when my partner calls me her girlfriend but I don't like it when I am gendered female in social situations especially if it comes with the extra baggage of gender roles. I have no idea what I want right now, but I'm so used to being the only cis around in my friendship group (haha I've been indoctrinated into the trans-agenda :P) and this is a big scary step.

I\'ve never really felt that ""woman"" fully reflected my gender but I didn\'t really think I could find anything better and I also don\'t experience dysphoria generally. Over the course of my relationship with my AMAB girlfriend (yay we\'re coming close on 3 years), I\'ve become increasingly aware of non-binary identities through my allyship with the trans community but I also feel that my experiences are quite different to many of the people I know well. I am not sure whether I want to change my pronouns because I like both she and they pronouns (currently use she). I like my appearance most when I appear androgynous and dislike my big boobs which are the biggest detracting factor in my opinion from the androgynous look. I like it when my partner calls me her girlfriend but I don\'t like it when I am gendered female in social situations especially if it comes with the extra baggage of gender roles. I have no idea what I want right now, but I\'m so used to being the only cis around in my friendship group (haha I\'ve been indoctrinated into the trans-agenda :P) and this is a big scary step.

2016-07-31 02:54:46,4vfchp,24,0,"Alright, so I obviously made a throwaway here for a reason, and it's not just because I know other people in real life that use reddit and I'd rather them not know who I'm talking about without my girlfriend's consent - I don't think I'm going to get much love for what I'm going to post here, but I told my girlfriend I'd give her a shot and I'd try to understand what she's talking about. So, here I am.

Background about me - I've always considered myself a leftist, politically, but never got on board with a lot of the radical social leftism that's been getting some spotlight more recently. So, when my girlfriend came out as bigender, I guess I didn't respond as I should have. I'll just come out and say it - I can't understand how this is anything but a mental illness, and I told her as much. I said, in addition, that that's fine with me, she's got others and this doesn't really make a difference, but she still contends its different from a simple delusion or something of the sort. So I'm asking you to explain what the difference is, here. My understanding of all this follows:


(and please, guys, grant me the benefit of the doubt here. I'm not trolling, I'm not from fucking the_donald or whatever. This is actually what I believe and I just want to see if maybe you guys can explain it better than my girlfriend can and I can better understand what she's saying.)

The way I see it, gender is a useless word. Biological sex exists, and gender is a collection of social norms that are entirely subjective and largely sexist. She says that she ""sometimes feels masculine and sometimes, feminine."" I am completely incapable of understanding this. 

I'm not a super masculine alpha male or something, I guess I do or feel things that'd be ""traditionally feminine"" from time to time. I don't feel particularly masculine OR feminine, I just have a Y chromosome with an active SRY gene and that's it. She was not able to explain why she sometimes feels masculine or feminine, and I think that was the biggest sticking point for me, since even these subjective, completely created gender stereotypes are at least loosely defined, and (I'd imagine) feeling masculine or feminine would mean adhering to these stereotypes in some way, which she says is not an accurate way to describe how she feels.

So, I guess to start, can someone explain to me what this thing actually is? I've read some articles but, to be honest, they seem to be generally written for someone who is already ""initiated"" - meaning someone who isn't convinced this is simply a mental disorder. I can PM our chatlogs (I got permission, don't worry) once I figure out the easiest way to blur out the names involved. 

Finally, please, PLEASE believe me when I say I'm not trying to start a shitflinging contest here, and I'm not a fucking right wing subversive element here trying to stir up trouble and bring screencaps of ""st000pid SJWs"" back to my alt right friends. I am actually a 20-something male who is completely and utterly out of the loop insofar as this stuff is concerned. Thanks in advance.
