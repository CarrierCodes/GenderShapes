2016-04-05 19:40:59,4di42z,1,10,"Hi. Born female, (mostly) identify as femme. This has been a big, confusing, long journey for me.

As a little girl, I often felt at odds with myself, my body, and what was expected from me as a girl. There were times where being a girl felt right, especially when I was able to use my body how I wished (being active, climbing trees, just feeling safe and free). But I often felt so odd when expected to ""act like a lady."" I never quite knew how to wrap my brain around that. Of course, now I know that I was feeling at odds with expectations and wondering why people wanted me to do some things but not others.

I acted out a lot. I was absolutely fortunately blessed by young, slightly radical parents who in my early years were very much unlike other parents who forced their kids to dress and act through gender norms. My parents' small act of rebellion against their own families' rigid gender roles and judgmental attitudes was such a saving grace. Instead, they simply wanted me to be a strong and happy person. In a lot of ways, days when I feel like I am happy in my skin, I feel closest to that young kid, playing in the mud and running around with the dog with my little sister.

But puberty hit and I began to feel... weird. Weird all of the time. There was a lot going on in my life, but as my body began to change, people began to treat me differently. From puberty to now, I began to have a recurrent gender crisis (though I didn't know that's what it was until many years later). I began to feel like my clothes, my body, none of it suited me. I would throw out all my feminine clothes and try to do my best to be a boy, as I knew it- unfortunately a lot of that was based on my own internalized misogyny and gender roles. It didn't quite suit me, and then I would feel at odds with myself once again, because I was trying to cram myself into another place that didn't suit me.

In recent years I have begun to feel that being in a gender and self expression flux is not just a symptom of my anxiety- that there is a reason that every 6 months I begin to feel desperately out of place in my own skin. So began my own journey into understanding myself. 

As it stands, my journey of trying to understand who I was looks a lot like this- straight, tomboy, lesbian, tomboy, androgynous, trying to be a boy, trying to be a girl, lesbian?? Bi, straight, cis, tomboy again, oh my god am I trans??? Wash, rinse, repeat. A lot of that exploration helped me get closer to who I thought I was, but just as much it gave me feelings of depression and self-loathing- I didn't know it, but I had jumped out of one box (straight, cis female) only to try to put myself in another, and I didn't fit.

As I've come to understand gender theory and the whole gender-sex-attraction thing, I feel like I'm starting to get closer to becoming that person on the inside. It's hard. There's a lot of difficulty, frustration, and pain. But I know that the alternative is even worse.

2016-04-09 07:09:06,4e0ejb,6,7,"Hi everyone,

34 years old/CA/not really a baby girl skunk, I was just looking at pictures of baby skunks when I made the user name. Aww.

Anyway.

So I've made a lot of progress in the past couple of days. I asked some questions on here at this sub as well as the Ask Transgender sub and Genderqueer, about low-dose T, top surgery, and all that. People have been really helpful which is great. I live in the Bay Area so I called the Pacific Center yesterday and will be going to a group therapy session/meeting for genderqueer and non-binary folks this coming week. 

Then I called Lyon Martin, an LGBTQ+ health clinic, and got an appointment for medical care for next month as well as left a voicemail for their mental health department to get a gender therapist.

THEN, today, I spoke with Dr. Mosser's surgery clinic about top surgery and scheduled a free consultation for June because YOLO. 

So I did all this and I've been trying to open up to people in my life a little more about how I'm feeling. On some level I feel this weird sort of giddy liberation. And I'm probably just emotionally exhausted after taking all these giant steps, but for whatever reason, instead of feeling happy and positive and liberated to be figuring this shit out, I also just feel:

1. sad that I didn't do this sooner.
2. sad that I feel this way at all.
3. sad that it's gotten worse over the years instead of better.
4. cheated out of a real childhood (I am FAAB and hit puberty at basically age 10, so there went that. got my period and then started growing boobs and I hated it and just felt like I would never be the same).
5. exhausted by the hat0rade I have run across on the Internet about gender-variant folks.
6. terrified of telling my parents any of this, yet feeling like I should include them in at least SOME statement about, ""Hi, I don't really think of myself as being 100% female and never have. It's okay if you keep calling me my name and using female pronouns and calling me your daughter because I am okay with being those things to you and I love you. But I just wanted to tell you my real feelings because I did not want to leave you completely out of such an important part of my life.""
7. really worried that there is something else chemically off with me that's somehow causing this, like borderline personality disorder or something. Or some manic episode or PMDD. I have not been diagnosed with any of these things but I am just not trusting my own feelings all of a sudden. Like what if I'm wrong about all this? What if I go back?

But I can't go back.

And god dammit, why should I, so I can keep being miserable and dysphoric and weird about everything for ANOTHER 20 years? Aw hell no.

So why can't I just be happy that I'm on this journey? Why am I so afraid?

Sometimes I think I could be happy being seen as something that's a ""girl"" but doesn't fall into the categories of cis or AMAB transitioning to female.

I just want to do it without breasts. And I\'m not sure what exactly that means for me. \n\nThere\'s a part of me that\'s afraid I just want to be ""special,"" and that if I was really nonbinary or genderqueer I should have known it before now.
