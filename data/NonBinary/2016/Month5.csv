I now help to train staff at CAMHS (started at the hospital I attended, now working with all Trusts in South West London, possibly moving to a bigger area/national later on) on how to best care for transgender young people. At this time I can only talk about my own experiences and those of two or three friends of mine, but would like to have more opinions/experiences to quote, to give the best advice I can. The more experiences I can draw information from, the better the training I can give, and ultimately the better treatment trans kids will get.
You can help me out by filling in this survey, or by sharing it round so I get as many responses as possible. Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully giving me a hand.

2016-05-10 04:25:35,4inkwb,7,9,"Hey everyone! I am a 20 year old nonbinary masc AFAB (assigned female at birth) person who is kinda struggling to come out to their parents. I am a college student but when I am on break, I live with my parents and grandparents (my mother's parents). I have been out to my mother since freshman year in high school as a ""lesbian"" and she's been cool with it, although we never really talk about it (I did mention when she picked me up from college this year that I was sorta seeing someone at the time and she seemed pretty chill about it). 


However, I'm struggling to mention my real gender identity to her and how I would like to medically transition (start taking low-dose testosterone so I am more comfortable in my body). Health insurance is awesome and all, but I'm not quite sure that I am ready to come out yet, and I know that the insurance billing gets sent to my house/parents, and I would wish to change that somehow. I'm listed as a dependent on the family health insurance (BCBS), but is there any way I can change the billing of my medical expenses/procedures to my personal address at college? Personally, I feel like it is not my parents' business of what I do medically unless I am ready to tell them/come out to them, but I am also unable to pay out-of-pocket for any therapy or treatments that I wish to go through to start my journey.


On the subject of hormone replacement therapy, I know you can't pick and choose the effects of hormones/testosterone, but I would like to get a lower voice (mine's really girly and high and makes me uncomfortable), squarer jaw, more muscle mass, and hairiness isn't a deal-breaker. I'm a bit nervous about bottom growth, as I do not have bottom dysphoria, and I'm afraid that a decent amount of growth might even give me a bit of bottom dysphoria, but I am pretty small (very, very small) to begin with, so I don't think it won't be a great issue. The reason why I would like to go on a lower dose of T (I know this relates to your own body and how your body handles hormones) is that as I do not identify as male, I do not want to fully present as ""male""/seem cis-male. I just want to be a bit more masculine physically to match my mental vision of myself.
