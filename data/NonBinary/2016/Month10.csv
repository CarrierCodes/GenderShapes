I'm still new to learning terms so I hope I do not offend and this is the right place to post. By my understanding, nonbinary can be a broad term so I thought I'd try here.

I am AFAB? I was assigned female at birth and I am 23 years old. Already that makes me feel quite old in the community as I see amazing non binary young children discovering who they are but, I suppose that's their journey and not mine.

There are times in my life, I do not feel I identify as a woman. There are times where I will dress or attempt to dress more ""masculine"" (I put in quotes because definitions of these things are so fluid?). This is something I've done, or feel I have done for a few years now. I gradually started to wear less skirts and dresses, although I do now and then. To be honest, sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable. I feel really exposed. 

And that's something I've noticed lately. Sometimes having breasts makes me feel uncomfortable. I was a smaller size a little while ago, experienced the same thing and it's worse now they're bigger. That is something I have experienced for as long as I can remember. They feel like two foreign objects on my chest that get in my way and I, for a moment, wish to take them off. But again, this is not 100% of the time.

I have in the past and recently had people refer to me using female pronouns (she/her). It makes me almost flinch, something feels off and I almost feel like they're not talking about me. I find also lately I'm trying to explore my gender expression so on days where I feel very disassociated with my birth gender, this irks me. Recently when my flatmate was having company, I subconsciously felt awkward because I was the only ""boy"". Referring to myself as such didn't feel off. 

I have a close group of male friends I formed over the years and there are social situations where they perhaps will almost feel the need to apologise for comments that women may find offensive. This also confuses me and feels unnecessary. 

I know a very common narrative amongst the trans* community is having strong feelings growing up. I know that I have for sure thought of a male name that I would go by. I also did wear a boy's top that my parents let me purchase (but I don't think that's a huge deal). 

I do enjoy wearing makeup, although I haven't for a while and recently it's just not been my thing. When I dress up and make an effort, so to speak, it feels off. It feels like I'm drawing attention to myself that I feel uncomfortable with. I have constantly battled to be body positive and love myself but I also have been diagnosed with body image distortions so that doesn't help.

I have also (just last night, for the first time) attempted to bind and tuck in the privacy of my home. I'm so so very curious. I did recently date someone else who is non binary and transitioning. I can't help but think that at first, I was researching to get a better understanding, to support. But here I am, still researching. I thought I wanted to be more like this person, that I was taking on too much of their personality. Could it be possible I am processing their transition for them or really it's just triggered a lot of repressed feelings I've had since I was younger.

I'm so confused, I feel emotional and so alone. I plan on potentially mentioning this to a doctor soon.

Hello I am VeggieBunnie,

I just want to share my story in hopes that it will help someone else along their journey. I'm 24 and for work classified as a female. How ever I'm non-binary and I'm so happy I can say that out loud.

Growing up I was a tomboy and it never really left the older I became. I just never felt like a girl and in later years never really felt like a boy either, I was just well me, and that’s how people saw me. That weirdo over there, and by the end of highschool I had come to accept it. I recall feeling pissed off and frustrated and getting into yelling matches for years with trying to explain to people that I'm not a girl. How ever puberty blessed me with curves and a very feminine body, that I hated for years. I went through the make up phase and all of it was inspired by David Bowie that man changed my life. I also would do my best to flatten my chest  so my boobs weren’t so apparent, and having large boobs that wasn’t the easiest thing to do. Over the years  I have come to love my body, and discovered I can be me regardless of what I look like now a days.

One summer in highschool I was watching the discovery channel about transgenders and how people felt trapped in there bodies. And I was like I feel trapped in my body, but I don’t want to change what I look like, maybe have smaller boobs but that’s it. My dad was convinced for years that I was going to be a boy. We have long since had that conversation and hes okay with me just being well me. This how ever never stopped me from leaning more toward masculine roles or just in my mind being in strong roles. I avoided dresses, and well all over girly clothing, because it made me feel so awkward. I did wear prom dresses and dresses for musicals but I knew I was playing so it didn’t bug me, I was confused to why it was actually fun. Then again I was always confused haha. I recall past boyfriends being like you need to wear this or that and then getting upset when I didn’t. I was completely confused, lost, and always pissed off at the world. Because how could no one understand what I was talking about?

It would always go well your not transgender so you should be happy with your body, well your not a boy because you have boobs and a vagina, your attracted to dudes, or blah blah blah. I would always end up in tears and sometimes very drunk It was really unhealthy. I had some shitty relationships and at some point i was like well maybe this was all stemmed from that, because i had read somewhere that people, sometimes will want to change their gender so the feel less vulnerable and wont get hurt again. But I was like nah because Ive felt like this for years. 
I went to college hoping to figure it out wrong, found my love for food though, and more hate and then depression. I had left a guy id been with for 3 years. Add that to all the other stuff and i was off in a bad way. It all came to a head when I stared playing around with make up and thinking well this is what society wants. I was miserable, all I knew is that I wasn’t a girl but i wasn’t a boy and no one believed me. I didn’t want to tell my parent because My brother had just came out of the closet and I didn’t want to over shadow him or make their lives even more confused.  Now looking back at it I wish I had try to join the LGBT club on campus, but I was also working 3 jobs so that may have been hard. However there is always more clubs to join. Fast forward a few years. I joined the military, best decision I have made so far. 

I was like will military manly it works, little did i know that it was going to be the changing point in my inner struggle. I was waiting to be sent to my duty station when a friend back home had sent me a video going ,i think you might like this. It was Ruby Roses transformation video. I watched it it put me in tears, i was like that’s it, I have no idea what its called but that’s it. So i looked up Ruby Rose and found out that she was non-binary. I just started reading articles, and books, because i had the time at the time. I was satisfied and felt really freed, it was the best birthday present I could have gotten that year. Only took 22 years for me to figure out what to call myself, and 2 years later I'm still making so many self-discoveries.

Now its not been rainbows and unicorns, but Ive never felt better. I even found a partner who really care about me for me. He thinks I’m a bit odd sometimes but really doesn’t question it, in all fairness he’s a bit odd too haha. There are days when ill dress like a girl and days ill dress like a boy that hasn’t changed. Well dressing like a girl has but I really only do it when I feel comfortable with it. He has told me I don’t care what you do has long as I don’t have to wear a dress. Fair is fair. I have also discovered Ruplaus drag race and im in love! I want to be a DIVA like them haha
I know I just rambled but I really hope this helps some one out oneday

My whole life, I've felt slightly uncomfortable with traditional ""girly"" things. I don't wear makeup, don't obsess over boys (I'm pansexual, by the way), and wear exclusively t-shirts and jeans. Basically, I'm what most people consider a tomboy.

But lately, I've started to realize that I hate being female and having a female body. Even though I have small breasts, I feel like I shouldn't have them at all. I don't want them.

I just never want either of those things to happen to me. I just... don't want to be female. It just feels wrong.

At the same time, though, I don't know how I would feel if I were to wake up in a male body tomorrow. I guess wouldn't be much better. I really don't know.

Mentally, I guess I would say I'm pretty androgynous. My brain seems like kind of a cross between the archetypal masculine and feminine personalities.

On the one hand, if I'm gender fluid, I don't need to really change my name. I go by a nickname as is and, generally, it's not the most male name in the world (although it is associated with men).

Basically a lot of people are concerned that this politicised movement is being used as a means of population control. I personally am indifferent to each of you on a personal level but I see that the movement was a radical fringe and is now being thrust into centre stage by globalists.

2016-10-31 23:04:47,5afog4,18,1,"hey y'all-- i've been thinking a lot about my gender identity lately, and am not sure whether to identify as trans or nonbinary. to some extent, i know that labels are not as important as understanding one's experience, but i'm curious to get some outside perspective and hear if others can relate to my experience.

i spent my whole childhood obsessively thinking about how i wanted to be a girl, not a boy. when i reached adolescence it turned out i was attracted to girls; my focus shifted to attracting women more than wanting to be one. 

more recently i unearthed the childhood experience i'd more or less repressed, and i've been reexamining my gender identity with a lot of curiosity and openness. what i've discovered is that my experience with gender fluctuates though trends far more to the female side of the spectrum. i'd say that if gender were a scale from 1 (female) to 10 (male), most of my time is spent between the 2-5 range, with periodic experiences on the male side between 6-8.

as i write this, it seems obvious that i'm nonbinary, but something about the trans marker often feels more appropriate, as i do feel pretty female, at least a lot of the time, and have since a pretty young age.

alright. i'll cut myself off there, but would love to hear y'all's perspectives. thanks in advance for the support and solidarity!",NonBinary,Trans or Nonbinary?,1477980287.0,"{'created_utc': 1477955087, 'id': '5afog4', 'num_comments': 18, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""hey y'all-- i've been thinking a lot about my gender identity lately, and am not sure whether to identify as trans or nonbinary. to some extent, i know that labels are not as important as understanding one's experience, but i'm curious to get some outside perspective and hear if others can relate to my experience.\n\ni spent my whole childhood obsessively thinking about how i wanted to be a girl, not a boy. when i reached adolescence it turned out i was attracted to girls; my focus shifted to attracting women more than wanting to be one. \n\nmore recently i unearthed the childhood experience i'd more or less repressed, and i've been reexamining my gender identity with a lot of curiosity and openness. what i've discovered is that my experience with gender fluctuates though trends far more to the female side of the spectrum. i'd say that if gender were a scale from 1 (female) to 10 (male), most of my time is spent between the 2-5 range, with periodic experiences on the male side between 6-8.\n\nas i write this, it seems obvious that i'm nonbinary, but something about the trans marker often feels more appropriate, as i do feel pretty female, at least a lot of the time, and have since a pretty young age.\n\nalright. i'll cut myself off there, but would love to hear y'all's perspectives. thanks in advance for the support and solidarity!"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Trans or Nonbinary?', 'created': 1477980287.0}"
