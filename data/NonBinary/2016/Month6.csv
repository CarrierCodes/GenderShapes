2016-06-01 22:29:57,4m3ysr,2,9,"Hey everyone. I've been questioning my gender for a while and I think I'm starting to settle on demiboy. Thing is, I'm AMAB, but I don't feel 100% comfortable with being male. I'm definitely not female though. I like the ""he"" pronoun, I'm fine with being a ""boy"" or (less so) a ""guy,"" but ""man"" just doesn't work for me at all. And I guess I've started to get really obsessive about removing my body hair — maybe that's a body dysphoria thing, I don't know?

So when I found this thing where you identify barely as male, or maybe as a combination of male and agender, it seemed to stick.

I don't really know where to go from here, though. I'd like to do something to my presentation to confirm that my gender's different, but I'm not sure what to go on — I don't have a new pronoun to use, I'm not really into feminine clothing. 

And stemming from that, I've got the anxiety that my whole gender question is self-indulgent. I mean, I'm an AMAB demiboy. In a world where nonbinary people get told they're not trans enough, that's like the definition of not trans enough. Here I am trying to figure out how to be a special snowflake, and meanwhile you've got people who need surgery or pronoun changes or hormones. Like I don't even know if I'm nonbinary enough. I certainly don't want to stand in the way of anyone who's got more of a struggle than I do.

2016-06-16 18:43:31,4oexdd,0,10,"Hi folks,

We have a decent-sized community here, but it tends to be pretty quiet. Two of the truisms about internet conversations are that people are more likely to comment if they don't have to be the first, and that people are more likely to click a link when given some context. To that end, I'm implementing a small rule change that OPs of link posts should make a comment after posting that's intended to start discussion. This doesn't have to be an essay! Examples of comments include any or all of the following:

- a short summary of what the link contains (and how it differs from other active posts on the same topic, if applicable)
- your opinion of the content at the link
- any sort of question you'd be interested in talking about

r/menslib has endorsed this posting format with great success and has a lot of active posters and threads. Note that I'm not endorsing (or condemning) the content of r/menslib in any way. Plus the nature of their sub's topics draws trolls and their rule is also partially intended to deter pointless #butwhataboutthemen comments, which is not really something we deal with here. But click over there if you want some clear examples of what I mean when I'm asking for investing in discussion when posting.  

I hope that this encourages more participation and a sense of investment here. Cheers.

Two of the truisms about internet conversations are that people are more likely to comment if they don't have to be the first, and that people are more likely to click a link when given some context. To that end, I'm implementing a small rule change that OPs of link posts should make a comment after posting that's intended to start discussion. This doesn't have to be an essay! Examples of comments include any or all of the following:\n\n- a short summary of what the link contains (and how it differs from other active posts on the same topic, if applicable)\n- your opinion of the content at the link\n- any sort of question you'd be interested in talking about\n\nr/menslib has endorsed this posting format with great success and has a lot of active posters and threads. Note that I'm not endorsing (or condemning) the content of r/menslib in any way. Plus the nature of their sub's topics draws trolls and their rule is also partially intended to deter pointless #butwhataboutthemen comments, which is not really something we deal with here. But click over there if you want some clear examples of what I mean when I'm asking for investing in discussion when posting.  \n\nI hope that this encourages more participation and a sense of investment here.

2016-06-21 06:38:16,4p3a6q,3,3,"Hi all,

I am a amab and consider myself non binary.
I have been thinking alot about the world and the idea that alot of the interactions between people are mostly a part of a  social construct made by human-kind through history.

Lets get to the point.
I am going to visit The VU Medical Centre in Amsterdam to start my journey into getting the body i want, but am a little afraid of the gender specialist team they have.

I dont know how open minded they are within the gender topic and i am scared that i wont be understood. They have a hard focus on the dysphoria part of being trans and i for a fact don't really have any form of dysphoria about my current body or social life.
They say people get mad if u put them in a psychiatric facility and thats a bit how my mind i thinking of the whole journey i am about the embark on.

I know what i want and don't like to go into this as a person thats searching for medical attention or something.
I have never had despressions, have a great social life, going to university to study sociology next year and have a great family.

I don't like the the feeling that some sort of dysphoria has to be diagnosed in their eyes and them trying to link everything i write or say to some sort of discomfort with my present life.
Their site even connected dysphoria and being trans with each other https://www.vumc.nl/afdelingen/zorgcentrum-voor-gender/

I am perfectly sane going into this and have confidence in the outcome and don't really care about people i dont know judging me when i start. My friends and mom will back me up for sure.
I just want to change my body not my open mind, you get it ? 

Anyone here have any experience as a non binary talking to the VU MC in Amsterdam ? 

Thanks,

Lesley
