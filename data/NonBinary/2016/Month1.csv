I help run a new text/voice chat server called Transcord. I've noticed that in a lot of other previous support servers, there hasn't been much of an effort in reaching out to the Genderqueer/Non-Binary communities. I hope to change that with Transcord. We're a very open server, and welcome anyone that's trans, non-binary, questioning, or an ally. We feature private Non-Binary rooms and as a mod team are always open to suggestions and critique. Feel free to check us out if you'd like. Looking forward to seeing you folks!

 * I am attracted primarily to women.
 * I am most attracted to a woman who appears hyper-feminine.
 * I am on occasion physically attracted to men.
 * I am attracted to men who appear hyper-masculine
 * I have a very strong libido.
 * I am averse to other people's genitalia (male or female).
 * I reconcile the above mostly via softcore porn from the far reaches of Deviantart (there be dragons).
 * I do, however, enjoy the rest of a lover's body very much, staying on any one stage of foreplay as long as my lover wishes.
 * I am intensely romantic, with a laser-focused emotional tie to my lover, who is the center of my universe when we're together.
 * I will do absolutely anything my lover needs me to...even leave. No hard feelings. If it's over, it's over. Still friends with most of my exes.
 * The last couple I don't consider a mere dating pattern. This intense romantic focus is a part of my identity.
 * My lover has thus far always been female, but I don't discount male or nonbinary lovers as a possibility.
 * I am not comfortable filling a masculine role in society. Like, at all. You could go down a checklist of personality traits you might consider ""feminine,"" and most of them would apply to me.
 * In fact, just go down the left side of this list: http://41.media.tumblr.com/9d267b198014ba86600ea5c97f5ab8b6/tumblr_nbryumwdfQ1tfilauo1_1280.png
 * I prefer women who can check off the right side as much as possible.
 * I envy women's options in clothing, jewelry, makeup, etc. I wish there were distinctly male versions of such things available this century.
 * Despite the last few, I wish to be recognized and present as a man at all times, even if my social role is completely different. However, this is only in physical space.

i didn't realize what that necessarily meant for me until way later, of course, since i didn't know nonbinary genders existed until the past couple of years which was like a lightbulb for me.

Lately I've been feeling incredibly angry with the world. It feels like every other day I'm called a special snowflake for wanting the people around me to be decent, and respectful of each others gender. Have been accused of being a fascist for asking if a list of pronouns could be extended, among other things.

How do you slog through all this hatred, bullshit, and lack of knowledge? How do you keep your head up as a non-binary person? It feels like the world is covered in spikes and traps- just waiting for me to fall into, and when I inevitably fall the cis-people around me snigger and say ""what the hell are you so torn up about?""

I want to work with others. I don't want to carry anger- I can already feel it destroying me from the inside. I also don't know how to let this pain and resentment go when I'm reminded of it everyday.

I can't be the only person who feels this way. What do you do to turn your anger from a destructive force into a constructive one? Or at least to turn the anger into a feeling that doesn't tear you up inside?",NonBinary,Help me build something from this anger?,1454301644.0,"{'created_utc': 1454276444, 'id': '43l30c', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Hello everyone,\n\nLately I\'ve been feeling incredibly angry with the world.
