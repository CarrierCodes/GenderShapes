This site has custom pronouns and your identity is just a series of tags, as many of which as you like being your gender. You get matched based on tags in ""i am"", ""you are"" and ""we'd be"". I am so excited about this site. :D

We have a telegram group for tech support and general nattering (linked on the site when you join), so that's pretty cool too. :)
