This study might be a good fit for you: 
• If you are willing to talk about your experiences with these two identities 
• You are 18 years of age and older 
• Identify (broadly) as being gender diverse (transgender or gender nonconforming) and on the Asperger’s/Autism spectrum.

please forgive if this is not the right place for this question, and let me know what to do to fix that if so. i am brand new to reddit.

i am a low-income, biracial, disabled non-binary adult living in the U.S. my question is, does anyone know of an online forum for survivors of sexual assault ***that is inclusive of non-binary survivors***?  recently i was really struggling, i called the trans lifeline, they directed me to aftersilence.org... but to register for AS forums, one must select gender, either male or female. i was heartbroken when i saw that.

i was also directed to FORGE, but i've previously tried to get on their listserv and no one ever emailed me back :(. they don't have a forum. i see that they have publications and already plan to read them through, but it already feels like they round people off to ""ftm-vector"" and ""mtf-vector"" that leaves me still feeling excluded so there's that.

anyway. if you know of any other resources that'd be great. i've previously contacted RAINN, NCAVP, all sorts of places and come up short. the main thing i'm looking for is a resource for sexual assault survivors (an *interactive* resource, like a forum or chat), where someone can vouch that yes, they are inclusive of non-binary folks. thanks in advance",NonBinary,resources for non-binary survivors?,1473039555.0,"{'created_utc': 1473014355, 'id': '515ar1', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'hi everyone-\n\nplease forgive if this is not the right place for this question, and let me know what to do to fix that if so. i am brand new to reddit.\n\ni am a low-income, biracial, disabled non-binary adult living in the U.S. my question is, does anyone know of an online forum for survivors of sexual assault ***that is inclusive of non-binary survivors***?  recently i was really struggling, i called the trans lifeline, they directed me to aftersilence.org... but to register for AS forums, one must select gender, either male or female. i was heartbroken when i saw that.\n\ni was also directed to FORGE, but i\'ve previously tried to get on their listserv and no one ever emailed me back :(. they don\'t have a forum. i see that they have publications and already plan to read them through, but it already feels like they round people off to ""ftm-vector"" and ""mtf-vector"" that leaves me still feeling excluded so there\'s that.\n\nanyway. if you know of any other resources that\'d be great. i\'ve previously contacted RAINN, NCAVP, all sorts of places and come up short. the main thing i\'m looking for is a resource for sexual assault survivors (an *interactive* resource, like a forum or chat), where someone can vouch that yes, they are inclusive of non-binary folks. thanks in advance', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'resources for non-binary survivors?', 'created': 1473039555.0}"

(also sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes as english is not my first language)
Let's begin: I am a girl and I have a very serious relationship with F., born female that identifies as nonbinary/genderfluid/doesn't really know.
I feel like F. is my one true love, we've known each other for almost 8 years know, we dated when we were 18 and now are in a more mature relationship after some time apart (we are 24/25 now). When we started dating again two years ago F. told me right away about the nonbinary thing and that has never been a problem with me. I love when they wear make up and I love when they wear baggy menswear. Today F. started a gofundme campain to try to get some money to buy a binder. That unexpectedly totally freaked me out and I am afraid I hurt F's feelings.
I know that it'll sound really selfish but I'm afraid that the binding could be the beginning of a female to male transition and that I might not find F. attractive in male form. I find the male body very unsettling and it actually grosses me out, I have absolutely no problem with androginous appearence though.
I fear that F's well beeing and my well beeing might not be compatible in the lifelong relationship I've always imagined, and I don't know how to express that or even if it's right if I do. I want to be with F. and support them but at the moment I don't really know how, that's why I'm writing here, I need some good advice on what to do. And please tell me that I'm not a horrible person for being scared about our future.

2016-09-22 04:15:45,53xanb,17,6,"Hey, first time on this subreddit so I apologize if this kind of thing has been beaten to death, but I genuinely want to discuss it because it bothers me.


Most of the people I know that identify as nonbinary are, well, biologically female. This seems to be consistent throughout real life, online friends, both online and offline lgbt-friendly communities, etc.


I've come to realize that over time, because of my experiences, I have somehow stereotyped nonbinary self-identification as a ""girl"" thing. Whenever I see someone online declare themselves as nb, a lightning thought goes: ""its probably a woman"". I hate that my brain does this automatic tic. But on some sort of subconscious level, my brain seems to have reasoned that ""nonbinary"" developed primarily because society's narrow limitations on their gender create an image that women don't want to be forced into or associated with. Same thing for nonbinary men, but since society gives men less trouble in general, theres much, much fewer nb men. Idk, I get kind of douchey inside cause my reasoning goes: ""they're still technically female, they just don't like stereotypically girly things. That doesn't mean they're something else. A woman can be whatever she wants, your gender doesn't define you, you dont need to disassociate yourself from it to act the way you want""


The twist is...I'm a trans man. Those kinds of excuses were what my parents would say to discredit me when I first came out to them. These were the kinds of excuses I made to myself throughout high school trying to come to terms with my identity, only for it to ring hollow. I've been tortured over gender identity my whole life. Being misgendered sucks. So thoughts like this make no sense to me. How could I finally start unraveling my own dysphoria and then shit on other people's, especially when a lot of it coincides with my own fears: what if ""I'm not actually trans, I'm just trying to run away from social standards of womanhood"", what if I'm just a...cowardly woman.

It's not that these feelings have never existed until now, I just grew up in a culture of suppressing what others may see as weakness. I grew up in a very traditional yet somewhat open minded Roman Catholic family. When I came out as a lesbian my family accepted me right away and I had a somewhat smooth transition into living and loving how I wanted.

Yet throughout my entire life I've always felt like it didn't just simply stop at being gay. I always felt this nagging insecurity that I couldn't quite peg. The older I got the more masculine my appearance became and each step I took towards that appearance felt right. Yet at the same time I carried myself in a slightly feminine manner. I enjoyed both. I identified with both. It always left me feeling very uneasy.

Over the years I chalked it up to just being butch, but I've been experiencing some strong dysphoria these past couple of years. I'm 24. My hips have gotten more defined and I no longer have that slim flat body. The things that make me noticeably female make me hide. I don't fit into the male clothes like I used to. But I haven't come to the desire of wanting to be a full blown male. I don't mind my female pronoun. I'd prefer a more gender neutral name. And I enjoy my genitalia and have no desire to change it. My main dysphoria right now is concentrated in my breasts and hips.

I feel comfortable now to be out as non-binary. To me it's so liberating to find the space and answers of where I belong. What lane I'm in. 

I would appreciate any advice as I'm going to start binding for the first time. My wife is unbelievably supportive and I feel like I'm finally at that point where I've accepted who I am and am just ready to be comfortable in my skin.

2016-09-24 10:29:45,549lva,8,10,"So I'm AFAB nonbinary, would consider myself bigender. I have days of various degrees of gender expression, usually leaning masculine with a binder some days. 

The issue is that it seems no matter what I do, I still read as female. Which wouldn't be a problem if people didn't feel like pointing it out all the time. I guess it's because I often move through male dominated spaces. 

Just today I was playing a game. I noted that the art on a card depicting creatures hiding in a wheel was kinda cute. The guy said ""I've only heard women say that. Us guys notice the big wheels"" or something like that. It kinda killed me a bit on the inside.

The thing is, I feel like I don't have any right to feel this way because I don't 100% everyday strive to make my identity obvious. I have long hair that I've kept long because it's fly as hell, and while I know men with long hair exist it's something I feel that would help if I did cut it. My face issuer round and feminine, which I can sorta change with makeup and maybe intensive gym workouts? I wear masculine clothes, I was wearing masculine clothes in this particular moment (no binder but I was wearing several layers and felt lazy/didn't want to die). My voice is naturally deep but still clearly feminine. I'm the height of an average man but everything else still reads female.

Which wouldn\'t be a problem if people didn\'t feel like pointing it out all the time. I guess it\'s because I often move through male dominated spaces. \n\nJust today I was playing a game. I noted that the art on a card depicting creatures hiding in a wheel was kinda cute. The guy said ""I\'ve only heard women say that. Us guys notice the big wheels"" or something like that. It kinda killed me a bit on the inside.\n\nThe thing is, I feel like I don\'t have any right to feel this way because I don\'t 100% everyday strive to make my identity obvious. I have long hair that I\'ve kept long because it\'s fly as hell, and while I know men with long hair exist it\'s something I feel that would help if I did cut it. My face issuer round and feminine, which I can sorta change with makeup and maybe intensive gym workouts? I wear masculine clothes, I was wearing masculine clothes in this particular moment (no binder but I was wearing several layers and felt lazy/didn\'t want to die).

My family has accepted my non-binary identity from day one and never even hinted that there are ""only two genders"". But every time I speak about non binary identities online outside of trans communities, all I get is a barrage of people trying to invalidate my identity. It comes from everywhere. Cis-het people, LGB people, binary trans people. Even non-binary people trying to invalidate non-binary identities other than the select few they approve of. 

It gets so tiring. Never has it made me doubt that I know who I am or that the thousands of non-binary individuals are any less than 100% valid, but damn if it doesn't get under my skin just to hear other people spout that nonsense. This morning, I had another trans person go cold shoulder on me because I introduced myself with my pronouns, and they were offended by it. They said they loathe the idea of people walking around in a ""BuzzFeed Safe Space"" (what?) and having 30 different labels. Then asked if I was one of those who thinks there are a million different genders. Of course I argued. And of course it was like talking to a brick wall. OR maybe spitting in the wind is more accurate because it did nothing but gross me out in the end.
