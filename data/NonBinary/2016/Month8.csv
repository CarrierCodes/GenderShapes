I am currently dating a non-binary person who is biologically female, and we have been together for a few months now.  We have had a really harmonious relationship and are very open with each other about out problems and helping each other with them.

However lately I've been depressed about the relationship,  and while I still love this person to death I'm worried about my subconscious attitude towards the relationship. I'm constantly worrying about making the wrong move, which may be partially due to them being my first significant other but also just because I feel I need to be more cautious about what I say and do. This is tied in with the fact that despite the fact that I am completely supportive of my partners identity as a non-binary person, I still get pangs and the feeling that they should be she, and that that is unconsciously affecting my interactions with them.

This is not in my near future, but part of my dream for life is to have children, who are my biological children. My partner isn't really into the whole idea of children and much less bearing children, and although I don't know that we ultimately will end up in such a relationship but I always look ahead and I have a hard time seeing how we could ever work out in that respect.

Finally, we won't be seeing each other for much longer as they are moving far away from me and neither of us feel that a long distance relationship is possible or what either of us want.

2016-08-20 22:16:07,4yrj15,7,6,"Hi, younger androgyne here. (Throwaway account for reasons.) I may post this on multiple subs because I need as much advice as I can get.  
I'm AFAB and going into high school this year. As if starting freshman year in high school isn't nerve wracking enough, I'm genderqueer and have some concerns.  
A little background information (This paragraph isn't necessary, but I kept it here in case others relate or have advice about other things as well): I've felt mentally androgynous all my life, and was lucky enough to become familiar with non-binary identities last year. My understanding of these identities was very vague at the time, but it was enough to know that it matched me. Since then, I've not only learned much more but transitioned my appearance to look more androgynous, which has made me more confident and comfortable in my own skin. I wear a binder and ambiguous clothing. Fast forward to recently, my frustration with being seen as a girl (social dysphoria) boiled over and I spent months on edge, overly-reinforcing my masculine attributes and snapping at the word ""lady"". Thankfully things have leveled out again and I'm comfortable. What I'm looking for is a few answered questions from some more experienced people. I know some of these are hard because they should be things I'm deciding, but I'd like more input.  
* First of all, what should I do about changing for gym? My parents say going to a separate room such as a bathroom would make me an outcast and segregate me from others. They think people would wonder about it and such. On the contrary, I wear a binder... I guess I could wear a tank top over it when I change. As long as I convince myself a ""girl's"" locker room is just another way of saying anyone-whose-biological-sex-is-female's locker room, I feel alright with using it.  
* How are things socially in High School? I've heard it's tougher in regards to drama and teasing. I feel like at the least people will call me gay behind my back because they don't know what to make of me(they did this at the end of 8th grade), and at the most I could be bullied or something. I just want to make my high school years as enjoyable as I can. I also worry if people will initially, if not always, be weary of interacting with me because I'm different.  
* Should I use a different name? The name I was given at birth is very feminine, and was the 2nd most popular girl name of my year. It's not too bad of a name... but last year I picked out a neutral name for myself that I adore, and my friends call me by it. I'm debating whether I should go through the trouble of getting all the teachers to call me by my new name, or just stick with my old one and keep the new one for friends. I guess ultimately I'd like to know if I should pass as an androgynous(in appearance) girl just to make my life easier until I get out of high school and have more freedom.  
Any other advice for surviving high school in general would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!

I don't know what I am. I'm not cis, but I'm not transgender either. At best, I feel like I'm a woman, a man, and neither of the two at the same time. My preference for physical representation would be as androgynous as possible, but I can't achieve that without surgery (I bind my breasts, but they're too large to be fully flattened - I'd like to have them removed or at least reduced). However, because I'm not transgender I obviously wouldn't be prescribed surgery by public health care due to incredibly strict regulations, and I can't afford to have it done at a private clinic. 

Looking at myself in the mirror makes me want to claw every inch of my skin to shreds. I can't stand feeling so disgusted by my body all the time and having absolutely no way out. I don't know what to do.
