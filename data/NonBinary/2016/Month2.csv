Yesterday, I fell for a girl at my school. I could only observe her from a distance, and as she smiled, something just clicked.

When I have girl crushes, my imagination gets sexual quite quickly, and with this girl, I feel the need to be a cisgender man and not the transgender person that I have been fighting for. This weirds me out because I now feel as though all the work I put into discovering my gender identity is gone with the wind once I'm kind of 'back in my proper role' (&lt;- read manly man). I wanna sleep with my crush, give them a proper fucking, generally just be 'the man they need' (how sexist is that?!).

Dysphoria becomes unimportant. The features I hated about my appearance are all of a sudden feeling appropriate. I tell myself I should actually rejoice because the burden of being trans is seemingly only related to me feeling as though I'd 'failed as a man'. But it only makes me more unhappy. I can no longer trust my own judgements. The reasons that make me want to identify as trans seem like a fraud, I become disconnected from myself. 

I don't know what the hell is going on with me and I need advice ASAP.

Today I had a long and unproductive talk with my mother about **misgendering** and she shared these gems with me (direct quotes, it was a Facebook convo and I can copy-paste):

- ""Can we just drop this?  I don't... know why this is such a Big Thing?"" and then later in the conversation when i realized we weren't getting anywhere ""OK fine.""

- ""What am I supposed to say?  'OH YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL... THING ???'"" gee, idk mom, if only there were a word for a human being that didn't include gender, like, oh idk, ""person""

- ""'What others think about you is none of your business.' Meaning, you can't control how other people think, or what is inside of their heads, so why drive yourself nuts worrying about it?""

- ""To me, you are my daughter.  And you will always be my daughter.  And that is how I prefer to refer to you."" yeah i fucking noticed that's why i brought this up

- ""I just want YOU to be happy.  Just tell me what I need to do in order to achieve that. And please don't tell me I can't put posts on my Facebook page about 'what a wonderful daughter' you are. I may understand otherwise, but I still need to share it with the world sometimes, and they might NOT understand."" translation: don't correct me when I misgender you on facebook because other people might not be as ~understanding~ as me, also tell me what i can do to make you happy i'll do *anything* as long as it's not this one relatively minor change

- ""Change... how... I think ... about this?  IDK how exactly you seem to think that I 'think about this?' I accept you as you are... surely you don't want me to change that? I love you.  Surely you don't want me to change that either?"" (guilt trippy af)

I know that at least part of this is my fault because I am not very direct at telling my mom what I think and what I want from her. But that is because she FREAKS the FUCK OUT at any hint of criticism, like, REALLY freaks out, and I'd like to be able to sleep tonight without worrying that my mom is going to slit her wrists while I'm asleep.

I know what I got from her is relatively minor compared to what some of you all have to go through but i have such a complex about my mom already (in case you can't tell from my comments) and this is really upsetting me
