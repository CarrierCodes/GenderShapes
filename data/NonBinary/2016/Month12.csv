2016-12-04 17:26:14,5ggh5k,16,5,"Hello!

I am designing a product that involves asking for gender identity at one point in the setup process. This question is very important to the product, and we're only asking it because it will make what we're doing significantly more meaningful.

In previous projects, I've used three text-based options -- male, female, other ^see ^note (which prompts an optional ""specify"" field) -- but this time I'm looking to do something more graphical / visual.

So my question is about gender symbols, and which symbol(s) might be most appropriate when placed with the binary Mars and Venus symbols.

Obviously, presenting [all the options](https://neuwritesd.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/1420041082350.png) would be wonderful, but unfortunately there just won't be enough space and it would create a difficult-to-manage user interface.

I love the *look* of this [transgender symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/A_TransGender-Symbol_Plain3.svg/2000px-A_TransGender-Symbol_Plain3.svg.png) and the [other gender symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Gender-Symbol_Other_dark_transparent_Background.png), but I'm not well-versed enough to know what either are considered inclusive of.

Do either of those symbols resonate with you in a positive or negative way? Is there another symbol I'm missing that you would think ""that's me"" if you saw it presented in a user interface?

Any advice / thoughts would be so helpful! Thank you!

*Note: I've never been a huge fan of the ""Other"" text label. I know there is sensitivity around the use of the word to describe non-binary gender identities. I've considered using ""Specify"" alone, but some people would rather not provide details, but would like to acknowledge that they are not male or female.

2016-12-15 16:14:34,5iicsk,8,4,"Hi all,

Obviously there's been a lot of press surrounding non-binary people and gender identities, and I've ready some articles about things going on (mainly at universities) and I have some question.

My current understanding is that sex and gender are separate, as in sex is defined purely by your chromosomes?

When discussing gender I get a little lost, and don't tend to follow the idea about how gender is for lack of a better word a ""scale"" or ""spectrum"".

In the case of sexual orientation, it is determined by your sexual attractions (gay, lesbian, bisexual, straight). How is your gender determined?

I hope this doesn't come off as offensive, as I don't understand much at all. But for instance, take somebody who is male in all aspects of the gender, except they like to wear makeup or cross-dress is that person then non-binary to an extent?

I'm not looking to start a debate here so if the mods see comments they don't like or if anything I say is below the belt, please let me know. I'm just looking to gain an understanding as people I've spoke to personally who are against the equality/social  issues faced by non-binary people, but they themselves are non-binary and haven't gave me enough of an understanding about being non-binary and what it means to a person.

I'm pretty comfortable with my gender identity, though I keep taking parts of the word off and putting others on (androgynous, androgyous-fluid, androgynous-flux, etc etc lol).

But,  I have yet to really get into my groove as far as presentation. 

Partly because I grew up a 'tomboy' wearing jeans &amp; T-shirts, partly because shopping of any kind (on the rare occasion i can afford it) gives me incredible anxiety,  partly because I don't know how to put clothes together,and the rest of it is all about my body shape. 

I'm 5'2"" AFAB, the scale goes betwern 150-160 lbs on any given day, and it may just be me but i feel like i have a ridiculously short torso. My legs aren't that long, though. 

i would like to buy another binder, but also wonder if a compression bra of sorts would be easier on my ribs (possible pancreas/gallbladder problems???¿¿??)

Ideally I'd be at least kind-of thin, long-bodied male-passing dude with long-ass hair, but i am not to the attainable parts of that yet. 
Like Yoichi from Drifters, ren from nu'est, etc...

But, sometimes I see an afab (usually cis girl) person, and I'm like... if I looked like them I'd be golden. ????

I want to either have people question themselves when they see me (is that a guy or a girl?), look like a 'feminine' guy... (Ideally i would eventually have my voice lowered (there's surgery for that if I'm not mistaken))

But, like... What can I do? 

How do I make my torso look longer? Hips/thighs less wide? How do I wear skirts &amp; dresses (and makeup?) without being pegged as a girl? would pics help? Or do I just need to be more, like, confident? 

Is this just me, or is this a very nonbinary feel? how in the heck does one assert for use of proper names/pronouns? 

Like, my life would be easier if I were surrounded by my friends all the time, bc they are all chill about it, but i see my friends at best 1 night every week or so (which sounds pretty frequent, but I spend 95% of the rest of my time at home)

That's not what I'm about, though, and if I wanted to write a story just to pander and get readers, I can get a lot closer to the lowest common denominator than just including a genderqueer character. that's now how I roll. I take writing seriously.

now, I'm going to give the basic rundown of my protagonist's situation, and I'd like any feedback people can give, if they think it's too forced, if they think it sounds trite, whatever.

so, things start out with a pair of low level nobles in a fantasy setting, having a baby girl. a doctor tells them they'll be unable to conceive again, and because of local laws and traditions, they need to have a male heir.

the baby is forcibly raised to be male. she has no choice in the matter. some days she feels fine with it, other days she wishes she could escape from it.

then she gets her wish. that medical person from before? apparently not super sure on how the body works in a rather low-tech, mid-level magic type of world, imagine that. they have a baby boy. She packs up her belongings, says her goodbyes, and ventures off into the world, excited to not have a future that is bound by what her parents are forcing her to be, and travels for a long while. but she still dresses and acts as a young man. because that's all she knows.

plot happens, and eventually, with the help of a caring friend, she begins dressing and coding as a girl. and she loves it! she feels absolutely liberated. she has to be careful, because some people are closed minded and have swords, but she is enthralled with this part of her life she was never allowed to have.

but after a while of this, she's laying in bed, and she starts thinking...is this it? is this who she's going to be forever? she realizes that she doesn't want that. sometimes, she doesn't feel like a girl. if she just puts herself in that role forever, it'll be trading one prison for another.

after some soul searching as the story progresses, she realizes that she doesn't want to choose. she shouldn't have to choose. she's both. she's happy being both. and she's not going to give that up.

there's a lot more that's going to go into this story than that one aspect of this character's arc, but yeah. I would like to know if anyone sees any glaring problems with this as a gradual evolution of a character realizing they're genderqueer in a world where that doesn't exist as a known possibility.

She packs up her belongings, says her goodbyes, and ventures off into the world, excited to not have a future that is bound by what her parents are forcing her to be, and travels for a long while. but she still dresses and acts as a young man. because that's all she knows.\n\nplot happens, and eventually, with the help of a caring friend, she begins dressing and coding as a girl. and she loves it! she feels absolutely liberated. she has to be careful, because some people are closed minded and have swords, but she is enthralled with this part of her life she was never allowed to have.\n\nbut after a while of this, she's laying in bed, and she starts thinking...is this it? is this who she's going to be forever? she realizes that she doesn't want that. sometimes, she doesn't feel like a girl. if she just puts herself in that role forever, it'll be trading one prison for another.\n\nafter some soul searching as the story progresses, she realizes that she doesn't want to choose. she shouldn't have to choose. she's both. she's happy being both. and she's not going to give that up.\n\nthere's a lot more that's going to go into this story than that one aspect of this character's arc, but yeah. I would like to know if anyone sees any glaring problems with this as a gradual evolution of a character realizing they're genderqueer in a world where that doesn't exist as a known possibility.\n\nplease, don't just upvote, it doesn't tell me what I'm doing right, and don't just downvote, it doesn't tell me what I'm doing wrong."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'author trying to accurately portray a character here, looking for feedback.', 'created': 1482376839.0}"

2016-12-22 20:12:47,5jsqo9,2,2,"Hello, all,

I've predominantly identified as female my whole life, but I feel like that doesn't adequately describe my gender identity.

When I was four or five I adopted a male persona named Joey, who was my idea of the quintessential 90's guy: loud polo shirt, cargo shorts, backwards baseball cap, sunglasses, sneakers, too-cool-for-school attitude. My mom thought this was adorable/creative and encouraged me, while my dad low key freaked out about it. However, he was not super involved in my life and I had much more regard for my mom's opinion than his.

In second grade, I changed my name to Max. All my friends at school and my teacher were cool with it. Then one day, about two or three weeks in, I had a substitute teacher who gave me grief for it, so I went back to my girl name.

My mom was cool with the name change, though. Overall, she did a great job not strictly enforcing gender roles on my brother and me. She would never designate a Barbie as a ""girl toy"" or a Tonka truck as a ""boy toy,"" and would let either of us play with whatever toys we wanted. When other adults called me ""bossy,"" she would say that I was assertive or a leader. She taught my brother that it was okay to cry and otherwise express his feelings, and that his favorite color could indeed be pink. Once I declared that I no longer wanted to wear dresses or skirts, she accepted it and let me wear pants, shorts, and overalls. 

Despite the nuanced understanding of gender that she tried to foster, as I got older I saw that society regarded men and women, as well as masculinity and femininity, as binaries. I staunchly identified with everything masculine and eschewed all things feminine. All of my friends were boys, and I referred to myself as a tomboy.

When I went through puberty, however, I started feeling more pressure to be feminine and present as a woman. I also developed a negative body image and self-esteem issues. Not being feminine no longer felt like a choice: it felt like I was too ugly to be a woman.

Now that I'm older, I've become comfortable with and confident in myself. I went to a 90's costume party as Joey and felt super strong and confident adopting a masculine persona. I've recently cut my hair short, so my general look is fairly androgynous.

When I was sixteen or seventeen, I began to identify as bisexual, and coming to that realization was a very nerve-wracking experience for me. More recently I started to identify as pansexual, and going through the questioning phase was less stressful this time. I'm more comfortable with not knowing now, so I'm sure I'll find a way to describe my gender identity, that feels right to me, with time and I'm fine if there's a wait.

Right now I'm thinking I will probably identify as something other than female, but I'm not quite sure what term most suits me. Hence my post here. I want to do some research and learn more before coming to a determination.",NonBinary,Questioning my gender identity,1482462767.0,"{'created_utc': 1482437567, 'id': '5jsqo9', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Hello, all,\n\nI\'ve predominantly identified as female my whole life, but I feel like that doesn\'t adequately describe my gender identity.\n\nWhen I was four or five I adopted a male persona named Joey, who was my idea of the quintessential 90\'s guy: loud polo shirt, cargo shorts, backwards baseball cap, sunglasses, sneakers, too-cool-for-school attitude.

I remember when I read Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Leguin in high school, I felt oddly connected to it. My teacher taught it from the perspective of a feminist sci fi world construction, which it undeniably is, but I felt somehow really into this world on a deeper level. I genuinely wanted to be like the aliens in the book, where they were typically androgynous but could change gender depending on the contexts (it has been a long time since I've read the book so forgive me if I'm misremembering some things).

I've also found myself obsessed with shape shifting characters as I grew up, especially if they were show switching between male and female forms.

Want to be invincible? You're a rock now. Super strength? Giant ant.) but even then, in my head, I'd think about how I'd probably typically use this power to switch between genders at will.
