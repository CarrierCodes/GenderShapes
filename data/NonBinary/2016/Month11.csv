2016-11-16 01:16:29,5d6exz,11,4,"Hi there. Fit, athletic(ish), non-binary on HRT, trying to keep my appearance male but with aspects of female. A foot in both camps, so to speak. 

Why am I here? Well, I'm hoping that someone can offer some practical and emotional advice regarding my relationship, which has been going amazingly well up till now -- we've hit a rocky shore.

My relationship with cis female has been awesomely amazing, we are really close. However, while I thought I was heading towards full transition, we both knew that the relationship would end, because that's not what she wanted. 

But, lo! After a lifetime of being in the closet, then 5-years of agonising over my identity, I discovered that I did not want to transition fully and finally felt really good about myself. Yay me! 

Anyway, my discovery was eventually revealed to my partner in a long heartfelt discussion, the both of us breathing sighs of relief that our relationship was intact. As it turned out, some level of transition is fine. 

Fast forward another couple of months and I get the chilling, emotion-laden ""We need to talk"". I was told that I have continued to develop physical, emotional and behavioural changes to a more female level, which, for my partner, crossed the line. Personally, I don't think the changes have been huge, so that's a little scary for me, because if it's that fine a line I'm not sure I can contain my development within such a narrow window. Then again, it's probable that both of our observational perspectives are skewed: she seeing more changes based on her knowledge of my being on HRT (I'm yet to be clocked as anything other than male), while I am likely a little oblivious to day-to-day changes and not seeing overall continued development. 

The upshot of these developments is that my partner has lost some sexual attraction to me, where she says that it's not the same as before, though we are still very physical in more emotional ways. This recent development is not the end, according to my partner, as we both believe our relationship to be very special and worth working on. To be honest, I was happy with my physical development when we had our first talk about this, so any additional changes are kind of arbitrary to me and am not at all against rolling back some of my meds (but how do I regulate this to keep, more or less, an equilibrium?)

However, I do have some doubts as to whether someone who has lost sexual attraction based on transition changes can ever get that attraction back. There's also the emotional toll on me being told that my partner has lost their sexual attraction to me, which I think is quite significant and makes me feel insecure in the relationship.

So, questions. 

1. What do people think of this situation generally (please ask for more info or clarification in needed)?

2. As I said, I'd like to roll back a bit of my development and try and keep as steady a physical state as is possible (is it possible?). How do people here, in your experience, maintain HRT so as not to:

(a) let testosterone levels creep back up too much or at all, as I barely have any;

(b) maintain libido (as a drop in estrogen adversely affects mine) and;

(c) keep the secondary characteristics (breasts) in check (I like them smallish, but fighting good breast genetics on both sides)?

Any help from you peeps would be absolutely awesome!

Thanks in advance :)

Oh, and for what it's worth (as YMMV), my HRT currently consists of: 

* 150 Spironolactone (daily)

* 1/4 tab of Cypro (daily)

* 75 Estradot patch

2016-11-18 01:02:34,5djm95,2,21,"So, I'm born female, struggled with my gender and sexual identity all my life until recently.

When I began dating the girl who I now know is my true love, she was so open and honest about her own experience with transition that it wasn't long before I tearfully admitted to her that I've always felt like my birth body didn't match up with how I wanted to be seen.

For a long time, I struggled with that big secret (""I want to be a boy""), and then- it was out. And then I realized, I had never considered what kind of boy I wanted to be, so in the safety of a few trusted friends and with my partner, I began to explore and give a voice to those long repressed feelings and desires. I began to read about non-binary trans identities and experiences, and to express myself in a way that was much more fluid and queer. I realized I always wanted to be someone whose identity was fluid, because cramming myself in a box on either side of the spectrum proved to be miserable in every way. I wanted to be androgynous. I wanted to move the slider over, so that no matter where on the spectrum I woke up, I could feel comfortable.

Finally, just last week, after months of consulting with my doctor, doing the bloodwork, and so on, he asked me if I would like to start my HRT that day. I balled up my fists and said... Yes. Why not? Let's do it. I only have one life to live, I want to start a low dose of T, and keep doing what was working so well for me- taking it a day at a time. Listening to myself. Seeking the support of community. And never trying to fit into a box again.

So far... well- psychologically the effects have been mindblowing. This last year, I've made great strides in taking care of my mental health for once, having never really done so. I stopped drinking. I'm far from better, but now I'm in a place where I don't feel like every step is a landmine. And within a day of that first injection... I felt so at peace. So unified. So calm.

The best way I've been able to describe it is this: I've always thought of this dysphoria and this deep hurt and feeling of not belonging as having two people trapped in the same body, one of which who never really got a chance to thrive. Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he's felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he's stopped throwing temper tantrums. He's even admitted that he's not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly.

But suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.

Currently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I'm not sure. I've already broken most of the ""rules"" and I've never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I'll just keep living it, day by day.

I love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn't secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I've ever had.

I won't pretend things aren't hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn't for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.

Thank you all.

But now he feels validated, he\'s stopped throwing temper tantrums. He\'s even admitted that he\'s not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly.\n\nBut suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.\n\nCurrently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I\'m not sure. I\'ve already broken most of the ""rules"" and I\'ve never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I\'ll just keep living it, day by day.\n\nI love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn\'t secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I\'ve ever had.\n\nI won\'t pretend things aren\'t hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn\'t for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.\n\nThank you all.\n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Nonbinary, gender fluid...

2016-11-19 00:33:31,5dpwc1,12,4,"Ok, guys. I'm desperate here and having ideations for about 4 months now. Lowest I've ever been. I am nonbinary. I have had successful relationships since high school with women. I was practically engaged just recently and we broke up because we had intimacy problems. This is the first time I have had experience with this and I'm not sure if its because I usually dated more conscious and active mates or if I have just come to a cross roads internally.  Here it goes:

She has always been gay. She is femme. She still had a bit of a princess complex which didn't help, but she constantly made me feel not masculine enough no matter how many times I would resist and say hey I am a woman too or I am very much both and enjoy being this way. She knew me when she met me, but again probably more projection during the honeymoon phase. In the late beginning we hit an issue when she told me she would like me to be even more aggressive and to hit her and choke her during sex, and for me with a history of physical and sexual abuse that was not a turn on and in fact was triggering in the moment. I had had experience giving it a try with another failed relationship, and knew myself this time. sigh. I told her that as a therapist, I can't ignore the fact that we are lacking true intimacy before I consider jumping to emotionless extremes. I already am an aggressive partner so this was confusing. I was open to her about this and we moved on but not without her constantly digging at me or cutting me down for not being a machismo fuckboi or some faux-confident gangster twat. Literally, what it felt like. She wanted me to be this unemotional object and would continue to cut down my nature, and eventually called me things like meek and soft, which I am aware that I am not. The oddest thing is I am fairly masculine and have always presented an even mix of both since childhood. I am in good shape and heck we were in love, so it was of course deeply upsetting after awhile. Eventually intimacy fell flat, I could tell her perception of me had changed. I wasn't sure if it was bc I refuse to be sadistic or its because of my abuse which I had to divulge. We talked about sex and it was a new reason each time. I have never had this intrapsychic struggle before, I've always been very comfortable letting my body be what it is. I constantly tried to initiate sex and all the different ways she requested or was expecting and she still overtly rejected me, one time she legit took her foot and pushed me away. I would leave every once in awhile for a night upset convinced she needed a different kind of partner, but she would beg and fit for me to come back. But she still tried absolutely nothing to make the situation easier or to get over the hurdle, as I tried. Zero effort, just ignored it and left me seriously confused about my self for awhile. We even went to therapy three times and the last session she came in and said she wanted someone who was more of an initiator! And yes, I was shocked and felt ambushed and responded by explaining how often I try to and she rejects me. The next day we ended it. 

Its been months and she handled it pathologically and told me that she wasn't getting wet and that I didn't tease her enough. She clearly does not know how to be vulnerable or intimate to even get to this stage. Maybe princesses live their lives constantly wet with a partner of 3 years, but I certainly didn't and told her this. 

I'm aware of her own issues here, that is not the response I'm looking for. What I am needing is some help. I feel obliterated and even asexual and not much like living. The most fucked up thing is that she dated someone who is now a FTM. I dont think its coincidental, but for me that is so against my fluid nature. Sad thing is if I was trans, I would probably take it even harder considering they truly want to present masculine... sadly sometimes toxically, which in this case they'd really not react well. I can't think of anyhting more psychologically abusive and narcissistic than to completely devastate someones sexuality. 

Has anyone had trouble in their relationships with their partners projecting faux-femininity or toxic masculinity on them? How did you survive times of deep and utter internal confusion and pain? How do you initiate as nonbinary and have you ever run into partners that got confused with your denial of roles?

Basically, after I will get my orchiectomy (which is non-negotiable due to the fact that I need it for sterilization purposes; after all, neither vasectomy failure nor saying ""I trusted her"" is an acceptable excuse to avoid paying child support for 18+ years afterwards), I certainly want to *permanently* get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible (as well as to get forehead-focused feminization surgery on my face) once I will become able to afford it (for the record, my planned orchiectomy is certainly my first priority).

Also, please keep in mind that, while I have previously heard some good things about estrogen HRT (such as becoming more emotional), I am unsure that I will actually be able to sustain taking estrogen HRT on a long-term basis; thus, I might have to take testosterone HRT instead.

I'd even settle for an inch or so of growth. I'm not sure if I want to go the HRT route since I do not want to change my voice or have any more body hair than I have already (also I'm uninsured and unemployed in the red state of Texas, so it's probably impossible anyway). \n\n\nI have been doing a lot of research and have read that pumping, over time, is supposed to increase the size, so I started pumping this month. I haven't seen any changes yet. I'm not sure if it's because it's a weak pump, or because I'm not wanting to go too hard too fast, or if it's just too soon.\n\n\nHas anyone had any experience with pumping for size?\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with nonbinary-friendly doctors in the Dallas area?\n\nAre there any other ways to increase the size?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Altering genitalia?', 'created': 1480143532.0}"
2016-11-26 01:36:02,5ex20v,28,4,"I apologize for posting *a lot* of questions here recently, but I myself am simply a person who is curious about a lot of things as well as about various people's views, opinions, and insights. :)

Thus, here goes:

In short, I myself generally identify as a male (though I am certainly also *extremely* willing to adopt a ""eunuch"" label after my (planned) orchiectomy) but also want to have a feminine (hairless) body as well as an androgynous (hairless) face. In addition to this, I also want to wear certain women's clothes on a semi-regular basis. :) Finally, I also want to get prosthetic testicles after my (planned) orchiectomy. (As for the HRT, I will use whatever HRT I am most comfortable with; however, as I have previously stated here, the orchiectomy is non-negotiable due to the current extreme child support laws.) Also, if this makes any difference, I myself get sexually aroused both my imaging myself having prosthetic testicles as well as by imagining myself having a vagina; of course, I certainly place *a lot* of value on things such as penis-in-vagina sex and thus certainly prefer to have a penis plus prosthetic testicles than to have a vagina.

Basically, though, what I am wondering is this: What exactly does it mean when I get sexually aroused by imaging myself having my ideal body and face? Frankly, I feel that after I will sufficiently feminize both my body and my face, I would literally be able to get sexually aroused and to orgasm merely by looking at my own body--preferably with certain female clothes on myself! :)

Indeed, are such feelings normal for transgender and gender non-conforming people? After all, I feel that I can get *almost* as much of an orgasmic experience and *almost* as much sexual joy from merely looking at my own body and face (*after* I will sufficiently feminize both it and my face, that is)--preferably with certain female clothes on myself--than I can get from things such as having penis-in-vagina sex. Heck, during my childhood, I first got *extremely* sexually aroused by the idea of wearing female clothes *way* before I first got *extremely* sexually aroused by the idea of having penis-in-vagina sex (indeed, the former occurred at age 9 or 10--shortly after I began hitting puberty--while the latter occurred shortly before my 16th birthday). Heck, even as late as high school, many--if not most--of my sexual fantasies involved me having a feminine body and face as well as wearing female clothes (as opposed to me having sex with women)! :)

Basically, what I am trying to figure out is the *meaning* of these feelings of mine; indeed, while I certainly know what I want to do in regards to both my body and my face (as well as which female clothes to wear afterwards, of course), I also want to try figuring out the *meaning* of these feelings of mine.

2016-11-26 05:39:56,5ey151,4,4,"Hi there!

So, the current relationship I'm in is with a cis-het female who I LOVE dearly, as she does me. I worry, though, as the chemistry between us wanes the more my physical features transition to female. Not that I want to really develop any further (which she's fine with), but I've discovered that it's notoriously difficult to find a happy medium, a sweet spot, between genders that can be maintained. It would seem that the the longer I transition, even on relatively low doses, the more I will continue to change.

So, worst case scenario, my current relationship does not last, what then? I'm 99% certain that it would be my final cis-het relationship. But, after I pick up the shattered shards of yet another beautiful relationship gone south, where would I look for a partner open to a deep and meaningful relationship in the future. If I were to ever seek love again, where would I look for people who are interested in AMAB, non-binary, male presenting, estrogen taking peeps?

1. To protest the current child support laws and especially the extreme nature of these laws.

2. To give other eunuchs the courage to come out (even though their reasons for their orchiectomies will almost certainly be different from my own reason for my orchiectomy).
