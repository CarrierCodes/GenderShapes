2016-11-02 18:20:52,5arkii,8,13,"So I've been with my boyfriend for a little over 2 months (I'm a cis gay guy and he's ftm, pre-everything). He's gorgeous and we have great sex (99% piv). My only issue is that he is always naked when we hang out inside and he sends me nudes when we're not together. In the past, with cis guys I've been with, the latter was really hot to me. Though I only get turned on when he sends me butt pics. His full frontal chest and v pics don't do it for me at all. I tell him he's sexy, which is no lie; objectively he has an amazing biologically female body. But he asks if I like/love his pics and I just tell him he has a hot ass. I don't know how to say that I would be much more turned on if he left a little to the imagination by concealing his chest and v creating the illusion he is cis. When it comes to the former, it turns me on more when he's got a shirt on and his briefs on with his packer in. When we hang outside and cuddle like that, it really, really turns me on and he loves turning me on, like a lot. When he's completely naked all the time inside the house though it takes physcial contact for me to get turned on. Even if he were cis, I find it sexier for a guy to wear underwear than to just be naked. But in his case, it would be sexier if he had a shirt and packer too. So my question is how do I broach the subject of what my preference would be without making him feel bad or screwing with his dysphoria. I feel like such an ass for wanting to basically ask him to ""cover up"" in a place where he feels so comfortable to be nude. But he really likes to turn me on and I don't want to lie to him. He wants to satisfy me in everyway and physically he does. Visually, however is another story. I love him and don't wanna hurt him but I also want to be honest so that he can please me. He really loves to please me. He loves what I do for him and wants to be sure he does so to me.

I've recently realised that for years I've envied the power of the female form for various reasons, sexual slectivity, more appealing form, options to choose to be dependant without (as much) social pressure of failure. 

But as much as I've envied these things I've also always been bi (70f/30m) and I don't think that my preference in partners would change, meaning that I'd likely not really want to exercise the extra ""pros"" of femininity but instead I'd likely still fall into a providing role in my life. This causes conflict in my thinking because I've got these wants, but the enacting it would require the sort of traits that I'd be working on disolving in myself.

I don't think I'd ever get bottom surgery beyond perhaps an orchi, as I am rather indifferent to the configuration of my genitals as I've never been strongly inclined to reproduce. so just tucking away a 'back up' sample(s) would likely suffice for hedging my bets.

I'm also unsure if my exposure to trans people via Internet, and my subsequent extreme attraction to the trans form is overtly fetishist or if I'm really also interested in being one.

I guess this is a confession. I dont really know who to talk to about how miserable and helpless i feel... and I don't know if this is the right place but i just need some support or advice from people who have had similar experiences.
 All my life I've wanted to be male... I've identified as male... 

I don't remember a time when I was happy being female. Even when I was very young I felt like I belonged with the boys... as a boy.

The only time in my entire life when I felt happy as a woman was a few years ago, I was in a straight relationship with a cis male, and he gave me my first orgasm. After years of body dysphoria and never enjoying, or even relating to my genitalia he made me feel good about my body for a moment of my life. 

That relationship ended soon after for many reasons, but maybe because of my dysphoria... maybe because of just the person I am. I don't know. 

I now identify as pansexual but haven't had a relationship or sexual encounter since that relationship ended because I'm so unsure of who i am or what i want. 

I can't orgasm without watching porn of cis males masturbating their penis and pretending it's my own body.

I have looked into surgeries and hormones and thought through all the options... but I know thay no mstter hoe far i go or how convincing i look, it won't make me happy. I will never have a real penis, I will always feel like I'm in the wrong body. I will always feel the stares and judgement from society for not conforming or being feminine. 

I don't know what to do. I just want to be a man. I want to be the person I've created in my mind. I want to be male.

I don't know what to do in just felt constantly depressed at every option because I can't just have been born male. 

There is no solution and I can't come to terms with it and be happy with my own body. 

:( 

Thanks for anyone who read or any support / advice.

Basically - no BS. I just want to be a woman. I like women's clothes. I wanna have breasts. I wanna look pretty. I'd love to be treated like a woman by men, and I'd love to be pleasing men. I am not fussed with losing the junk down under, I'm cool with whatever, a vagina or a penis, might just keep it in case i need it later down the path (i.e. if i want to become a parent one day)

But *I guess* I can go the rest of my life as a man if I had to. I just would feel better and more able to live my life how i want to if i was a woman. I'm sorta getting to the point of understanding we really have no purpose in life, apart from biologically to be born, reproduce, then do whatever until we die (just my viewpoint as a nihilist) - whether or not I become trans will not matter at all in the end, because we all die one day. I just don't wanna end up in my forty's and feeling regret like: I should've transitioned when i was younger.

A quick story: I dug out the old xbox today and started up skyrim, created a new game cos its been ages since i played, and I wanted to choose to play as a woman, and spent a good 20 minutes tryna get my character looking how i wanted her (or in the games sense, myself) to look - and I usually always when I play games create or choose a character that looks the most like me ( for some sense of realism, idk? just something i do), but this time I wanted to play as a woman character.

another one: I went to some sort of a flea market / vintage market with my uncle and cousin today to pick out some vinyl records (my cousin is a pianist, my uncle is a DJ, and I'm an audiophile (music enthusiast) and am learning to DJ) - basically, I saw this vintage women's fur coat, which i thought looked really good, soft and comfy, at a different stall for pretty cheap. I was madly thinking of ways I could maybe buy it and sneak it in my bag but i didn't want to raise any eyebrows on the way back home. I think tomorrow I'm gonna catch a bus there and buy it, bring it home in a bigger bag - and wear it when I'm home alone. Only fear is my parents finding it in my room by any chance - trying to explain it to them. Also considered buying some high heel ankle boots that i found and really liked - that's gonna be 2000 times harder to explain if my parents find that.

2016-11-21 18:12:55,5e5ih3,6,4,"Hi, I've been looking for the right place to post about this for a little while now. I hope this is right. Please let me know if somewhere else is more appropriate for this post. It's been on my mind since I first saw the show, and my upset hasn't gone away. The first night I was so furious I couldn't sleep.

**Background:** I have been watching the A&amp;E show *The Killing Season*, which revolves around a series of bodies found on Long Island in New York. There is at least one suspected serial killer for four of the bodies, and all the identified women seem to have been sex workers. It's a secluded location, and the perfect place for dumping bodies, especially since most of them hadn't been found for several years. The viewer is led to believe this is hard-hitting journalism that does the work the police are too callous to do. This should be an expose, but falls flat on many regards (mostly the shoddy detective work and sloppy accusations). This particular failure, however, really got under my skin.

**How this relates to this sub:** One of the bodies is identified as ""Asian Male"", since that body was the only non-white person found, and they had external male genitalia (hence the body's identification as male). I will use they/their pronouns. The whole show revolves around solving the cases of the white sex workers, and ""Asian Male"" is likely unrelated to the other bodies. ""Asian Male"" was dressed in women's clothing and was badly beaten, leading some to believe they were killed in a fit of rage by a john (It reminds me of the tragic epilogue to *Paris Is Burning*). At a certain point in the show, there is a promising lead for ""Asian Male"", but there is no sincere follow up. The show's hosts, who are supposed to do the investigative work that the police won't do for these bodies, just continue the cycle with their treatment of ""Asian Male"".

**My problem:** My first issue is the continual referral to ""Asian Male"" as male. Add the possibility that they were a runaway for potentially being trans really breaks my heart, given that even in death, they are not being respected.  The investigators describe the likely murderer as angry at being ""tricked"" really pisses me off. When it comes to identifying the body, the sketches represent ""Asian Male"" with short hair and make no mention of the fact they may have identified as a woman. 

I don't know why I'm writing this, I guess I just want other people to commiserate with. Has anyone here seen this show?

Wow I wasn't expecting to go that much offtopic, anyway let's keep on rolling, that closing bracket will come eventually, right? So yeah, my parents. You know they've never really hit me, I may have been slapped once or twice, but that's it. Nothing much physically hurtful, it was more of the degrading kind. God I was so scared to be yelled at. I was constantly yelled at. My mother denies it today like she doesn't remember, but I remember the feeling, the anxiety when I was hearing the door opening down stairs (meaning my dad was coming home), I didn't know if I was gonna be yelled at for something I did wrong or not. And you think what? That I would put effort not to get yelled at? Wrong! I could never do my homeworks. How could I? I was feeling like if I ever did my homeworks, my parents were gonna glorify themselves for having yelled at me to a the point that I did my homework. And everytime I was given detention, the anxiety was raging inside, because I knew I was gonna be bawled out. The degrading things I did or say to people, to avoid having my parents yelling at me. Respecting myself or other people was not something I had been taught. What I had been taught was focusing on behaving properly and fearing repression... except the rules were random, and thus behaving properly had no sense, so we can say that I've mostly been taught to fear repression thanks to my good friend Anxiety! So much abuses of power. And although I knew something was not quite well, I was not beaten up by my parents, that meant things were good, right? That's how you differentiate good from bad parents: bad parents beat up their kids. Therefore, mine were necessarily good parents, so things were ok. They're not evil you know, it's just that, my mother feels insecure and fears rejection (who doesn't) and thus needs to controle things a bit, and my father... well, it's complicated, I don't know much about his past, but he's certainly very concerned with his public image. And for the yelling very loudly, I don't why they did that, I don't think they were taking much pleasure out of it, they just didn't realize how destructive that was. They didn't congratulate me much. When I was bringing good marks, my dad was only saying: ""you could have done better"". Chasing after the admiration of a person who degrades you, how unhealthy is that? And about self confidence, that wasn't pretty, not many healthy friends around. About physical affection? Well not much. I mean, I don't remember my mother ever hugging me anytime, and I surely remember my being repulsive to my father touching me (no wonder where my today's urge for physical touch comes from). Still today, I don't know how to put words and talk about it. Also, I have a brother and a sister, and they suffered their own way of that education and are not fully willing to admit it (they are in good relation with our parents). The irony is that they used to make me cry all the time, and now that they put so much effort in locking up my heart, I cannot cry anymore. Okay, enough with background story, CLOSING BRACKEAAEAEAT). Just as a (self) reminder I was listing stuff that was making me doubt being cis, so let's carry on.

I enjoy being around girls (I sometimes reach some ridicilous pick of urge to be surrounded with feminin energy). I find girls' cloth very aesthetic, I like them, I watch girls in the street and enjoy their taste and their way to dress. And about sexual orientation (let's put romantic orientation aside for now), I'm so confused. I'm so attracted to women (in a non sexual way)! With the girls I like, I want to share affection and huging and say sweet words and being kind and telling them that I love them, holding their hands. With boys.. that's the exact opposite. I would theorically enjoy sexual intercourse with a man (with me being penetrated), but when I'm around guys, I'm not that much attracted to them, or just a little, and if they touch me too much, I'm scared it sexual signals.

I'm not sure I'm happy with my social status of man. I sometimes feel it when interacting with a person, the feeling that my being myself is limited. Let's say interacting with that person (let's call him Hector) is metaphorically walking. So, we walk for some time, and we arrive in front of the sea, Hector continues along the sea. Not me. I freeze and look at the horizon. There's something over there. I can feel it. It appeals me. I can't reach it, I don't have a boat. Then I realize that I'm awkwardly standing still, and I follow Hector.

I originally just came to say that if I am transgender, I don't see how I could ever accept it, I don't feel disphoric enough to find the courage to make such a massive change in my life, and I find it a bit sad.

Also you people are very brave for stepping that step and for doing what it requeries to be yourself!

2016-11-29 13:54:39,5fiqxt,27,11,"Reddit, 

I'm using a throw away, for reasons. 
I come from a background where masculinity in men is your life blood. I grew up in a farm shooting guns, chopping farm wood, herding cattle and breaking in horses. 
I competed at state level for martial arts. I enlisted into the army and I'm a big, burly, muscular guy. I can defuse IED's, I can kill you with my bare hands, I can kill you from 1100 meters away and I can handle a guy thirty kilos heavier than myself. 

But reddit, here's the thing. I don't know if I'm actually a dude. 

It started off with realisations of small things. When I was a kid, I used to wear my shirt collar around my shoulder. You know how girls sometimes have shirts that reveal their shoulders? Like that. Or I'd sit like a girl, or I'd get ashamed for sitting in the toilet when I had to piss. Or in front of my dad, I'd say 'I want to be cat/wonder/bat-woman' and he'd be like 'son, superman.'

So I shrugged that off and was like 'alright, dad.' And went and did what he said. I want to be clear, my dad is a great guy, he was in Vietnam and he has taught me a lot about work ethic and helped me become who I am, but he's very old fashioned and probably doesn't even know what transgender is so don't judge him to harshly, please. 

So reddit, it went a bit further from there, if you're still reading, thank you. But when I got older, I grew my hair out, I tried on chicks bra a few times, I used to make female gestures and cross my legs, walk sometimes, and even imagine being a female. 
I'd do this in private obviously. But my family started noticing my feminine qualities I think and started bullying me for being gay. And I came close to an emotional break down. 

I stopped, I 'manned up' and joined the military. I got my ass kicked into a man and I felt... out of place. Like when the boys are talking about girls and the girls they fuck and their carousing and shite, I just didn't connect with them. It's hard to explain, but it's like the voice in my head is a girls, not a dudes. 

Even now, I have a missus, and I love her - I'm going to marry her in the next two years. But, sometimes, I like to lay down in bed like a female, or stand like a female, or something like that. And it feels better. I imagine myself with a chicks body and it makes me smile. I like to use female avatars in MMO's and I'm writing a book with a female lead that I can kind of see myself as. In the first draft, I write her as a lesbian, I don't know why. I just did. 

If you're still reading this, I have information that could lead to Hillary's arrest. 

But here's the thing, reddit, I don't know if I amtrans.  If I was, wouldn't I be attracted to dudes? Or if I do trans, won't I stop loving my gf? I don't know if I have body/gender dysphoria so how could I be trans? 

I'm upset, I'm confused, I'm ashamed. I feel like I should do ... something. I didn't cry when I lost my grand father. I didn't cry when my family lost their family home. I didn't cry when I left home, or when I left the army, I didn't cry when I lost a string of other relatives or when I turned my back on my mother for being abusive when i was younger. I didn't cry when my father walked out when I was younger, but I want to cry now. 

If you're still reading this, thank you. 
If you reply, I don't know how to thank you. 

Yours,

2016-11-30 19:32:37,5frm43,2,3,"Recently I've been reflecting on how in so many aspects of my life I'm caught in between two things, specifically in relation to my gender identity issues. It's like when I try to hop over to one side I hear the other side calling my name. When I go to the new side I hear the first one calling me back and I just go back and forth like a pendulum swing. I was hoping to open up a discussion with others to see how their experiences relate and what they did about it!

Most of them are physical issues. My body type is tall and skinny/athletic. While I'm certainly not muscular, I do have fairly good muscle definition and a somewhat broad skeletal structure. My shoulders are wide, my hands and feet are of good proportion, but I certainly don't feel manly. In fact, I feel quite small and feminine, which is why I suppose I have these trans thoughts and feelings.

When I'm wearing men's clothing, this becomes uncomfortably obvious to me. I don't fill out my shirts because while my shoulders are wide, they are not big and muscly but small and bony. My hips and legs are small, and so pants either accentuate my skinniness or I wear baggier pants that don't look like they fit right. All of my long sleeve shirts and sweatshirts are too big by the cuff, and because I'm so skinny I usually can't roll up my sleeves without them eventually falling back down. Nearly everything piece of men's clothing I wear results in the disappointing realization that I haven't quite ""made it"" (as far as society is concerned) as a man. I've been able to, in the past few years, correct some of this with adjusting my posture, but that only fixes so much and it still just doesn't feel all right with me. I still don't feel like I'm in the right clothes. I don't feel comfortable.

Well what would be the obvious answer? It would seem to be to wear woman's clothing. While I love the way I look most of the time in women's clothing it isn't always quite right. I feel comfortable, but not completely. I feel sexy, but not always. When I wear woman's clothing the exact opposite thing happens as when I wear men's. In men's clothes it seems all the feminine properties come shining out, but as negatives. In women's clothes all of my masculine properties come shining out, again as negatives.

In woman's clothing my shoulders are too broad, I have to cover up my arms from shoulder to wrist because suddenly they look like I've been lifting everyday for the past three years. My body hair comes spilling out of every spot not covered by clothing, even poking through my stockings. My feet are too big for woman's shoes, my hands too big to comfortably fit through the sleeves I need to wear to cover up my arms without stretching the cuffs. I feel like a big hulking mass trying to squeeze down into these tiny clothes. Maybe it's because I wear my girlfriend's clothes and she's a bit smaller than I am, but I know if I got slightly larger clothes the same issues would arise.

Other issues I'm stuck on are things like facial hair. I grow enough for it to be noticeable, but it's not a full beard. When I have my ""beard"" I look much more masculine, and when I shave it I feel way more feminine, but never quite making the cut either way. Same goes for body hair, but who can keep up shaving your entire body. It's so time consuming and usually ends up uncomfortable so I abandon it until I hate the hair enough to Nair or shave it off.

When I'm with other men, especially if they're not close friends, I feel small and meek. I feel in a sense younger than everyone else. Timid. Like they're all bigger and older and just more of men than myself. It makes me feel like I should be a woman, that I've no place in this world of being a ""man"". But when I'm with a group of women, I feel like the man of the group. I find my voice drop down low sometimes. I can't participate in a conversation how I think I'd truly like to, because I don't feel comfortable showing that part of myself. I feel like I don't belong, similar with how I feel with men, except there's nothing I'd like more than to just be one of the girls and join in in their fun and do girl stuff.

Almost everywhere I go, whoever I hang out with, I don't feel like I really belong. I'm currently working on being myself in every moment, and not feeling like I have to belong to a group or a clique to feel secure in my own being. I'm trying to not react to other people's energy that sway  me into behaving one way or another, but it's difficult because I'm afraid of the judgment that comes from people who don't get you. That's why I love communities like this, because while we're all different in many ways, we share many similar experiences, and so I thank you all for being here for each other when we really need it.

2016-11-30 21:29:39,5fsbh2,11,9,"I'm AFAB but I've always felt different.  Not a boy or a girl.  Even when I was younger (up until middle school) I insisted I was a tomboy while explaining that meant I was something inbetween.
But I've also realized I prefer women as romantic partners.  So I consider myself gay?  It feels more right but I also feel like it doesn't make sense.
So I guess my question is: if an AFAB agender (or genderqueer?) person prefers women does it make sense if they consider themselves gay?

I'm still trying to understand terms so if I said anything wrong please tell me!

Question #2 is more medical as far as going on T (I'd like to appear more masculine if I had a choice)
