A group of friends have been organizing a get together yearly in NC. About half of the attendees are from the state. Many, including myself, are from out of state. A number of us have been discussing not attending the gathering this year, but the truth is that this is only likely to hurt the person who has already shelled out money to organize the event. Rescheduling or relocating is not an option.

Our group is primarily but not exclusively men, mostly straight.

Some of us had been floating the idea of finding a way to show solidarity while we are down there. We will be in Chapel Hill, a relatively liberal area of the state and were seeking an event to attend, but there did not seem to be anything happening while we were there.

Some people had also floated the idea of showing up for a day of the event in drag as a lighthearted way to raise awareness for people who were local and to publicly show our support. My initial reaction is that this seems inherently... offensive? (opinions needed here). Unless we are representing something about ourselves it seems callous/insensitive for us to do this, especially knowing that we will get some laughs or eye-rolls from the situation, whatever our intentions are. 

I spoke to a trans friend who said, if you ""have"" to go, don't buy any of your food there or patronize any businesses. Its something worth considering but would have a significant impact in our regular plans. This is a 10+ year tradition for us, and while next year may be a fine year for a change, its too late this year to make alterations. Additionally its not as if Chapel Hill business owners are supporting the state's governor or electing representatives that authored the bill, as I said, its a liberal area.

So, what are my options? We have 8-10 mostly straight, all cis people who want to do something while they are in NC due to our discomfort travelling there but are unsure of how to approach the situation with the right sensitivity.

I want to be sure that whatever my opinion on these issues, it's based on as much information as possible. Here's how my position goes as of today: I'm of the opinion that if our current society (in the US) were more completely accepting of feminine men and masculine women, trans people wouldn't feel the need to transition, but would feel comfortable remaining their current sex while expressing femininity or masculinity as much as they want. For example, if a man feels very feminine and wants to express that, then in today's social climate he may decide to transition to female (which I fully support! Do whatever makes your life a happy one). But if our culture fully accepted femininity in men and masculinity in women, that feminine man would express himself as a feminine man, instead of transitioning to womanhood. Am I missing something? Is there something about being trans that I don't understand?

There's nothing wrong with them, most have been worn no more than 3 times or never at all and just aren't my color or I have a similar color. 

I remember what it was like getting into makeup and how much you had to experiment with colors and such, and I was thinking I could post here and might be able to help out!

I have sanitized them all by spraying them with alcohol, wiping away the top layer that my lips would have touched, and and spraying with alcohol again. You wouldn't have to be worried about my cooties.

Anyways, they're free to a good home. I would just ask that you pay shipping. Just let me know which ones you want, first come first served!

I remember what it was like getting started in makeup and how overwhelming it was, so if you have any questions about any of these let me know. No makeup question is a dumb makeup question! You can google the colors to see what they look like

* ~~OOC lip Primer~~

As a kid I would secretly try on women's clothing and stuff a back brace thing with socks so it'd look like I had breasts. I was also obsessed with Transformers because they could just transform easily into something else. I dunno if that's relevant but yeah. But I've never felt like I was trapped in the wrong body or anything, you know? Like I was always okay with being a guy, but I also wished I could just try being a girl. Like, for a day.

I'm French and currently working on a research project on the **perception by EU LGBT of their rights situation in their country**. 

Every year, [The Rainbow Index](http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/rainbow-europe/2015) publishes a report which ranks each EU country based on their handling of LGBT rights and issues. I want to find out whether these results reflect reality. I would love it if you could help me do that.

If you live in **any European country** and you're interested in giving me a hand (hehe) for this project, here are questions you should answer (you can PM me your answers if you'd rather):

You can access the [survey here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/898XBPT)

* 1- How do you **perceive** the state of LGBT rights in your country? (Let me know how you feel on a daily basis at home and **where you are from**)

* 2- How do you **reach this perception**? (What means do you use: personal experiences, social media, news, organisations...)

* 3- Are you **familiar with** the Rainbow Index?

If there is anything else you'd like to add, please feel free to do so! 

A million thanks and hoping to hear from all of you soon! Don't hesitate to ask questions.

*Smooches*",trans,"Hey all!

So... I've been transitioning for 6 months, that is on HRT for 6 months, I wanted to have my body and hormones change as I adjusted... plus with my physique being really tall.... I kinda felt like it would help with my transitioning into being a girl full time, and it has.

But recently I've been having a hard time feeling feminine.... like... during the day I dress up like a guy (sorta, I still have painted nails and a hairband to keep my hair back) and when I have time and I'm know going anywhere I wear female clothes... I can feel feminine at times... but most of the time I just feel.... ""Bleh""... like I'm not really even human in a sense.... worse is when I feel like a man.... it doesn't help because I have a gut too.... even worse... I have a regurgitation reaction when I try to eat vegetables.... well most of them, like broccoli, lettuce, spinach, etc.

So I guess my questions are these:
1) Any tips on feeling more feminine?
2) Any tips on targeting the stomach area without risking building up bulk?
3) Any tips on how to start eating salads?
