I'm a little all over the place, emotionally, and in terms of expression. I have no idea what things like this are SUPPOSED to feel like... so I've turned to the internet for help. So far, I'm still not sure, so I'm on good ol reddit.

As I say, I haven't felt like this forever however… And it makes me wonder if it counts as transgenderism, or if I'm just going through a ‘phase’, as many people do... it feels odd... but the idea of being a guy is exciting to me, even if I'm not a typical one...

I've been living with a childhood friend of mine for almost a year now. We are both male; he identifies as straight and I identify as bi. The thing is we both have feelings for each other but feel incompatible due to our genders, and he stated that the only thing he felt was in the way was the fact that I am a guy rather than a girl. The dynamic of our relationship is very unusual. We've known each other for 7 years, going on 8, and I've always felt really close to him and like I could trust him. We tell each other everything and I feel safe with him and like I love him. From our conversations I've learned that he feels these same feelings, but our genders are a deal breaker. He told me if I wanted to become a girl he'd be interested, which brings me to my next point.

As a kid I remember feeling like a girl in a guys body but I kind of dismissed the thought because it didn't make sense. I never put too much thought on it but I am aware that throughout my life I've always wanted to be a girl. These feelings have been increasingly prevalent recently, but I understand that could also be because of the situation I previously described. I believe that my personality is also very feminine. So when he said that he would be willing to date if I could turn into a girl I became interested in exploring this further.

I guess I'm really unsure of how to fully explain the situation. I am happy to provide more details if needed but I do have a few questions.

Where can I find more resources about undergoing MtF surgery?

Is this a bad idea? I'm not seeking internet approval about changing genders, but I'm wondering if there are factors that I'm not considering.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and is able to offer advice?

Please keep in mind I'm only speaking from a short term limited basis but I speak none the less.

Are you a ""tough"" person? Ask yourself before you start hormones ""how do I deal with my feelings?"" Hormones are gonna change you sister. Tough doesn't stand a chance against estrogen. However as you break down and pick yourself back up will be stronger, emotionally. 

Is your partner straight? Your partner may love and cherish you, hold you close and promise you they'll always be there but they may not be able to change the orientation they were born with any more then you are able to change how you were born. If they leave, get ready to greave like you have never grieved before. Tears will flow.

Are you ready to change? There are in fact some aspects of your personality that are gonna change as you transition more and more. Weather it be a reaction to your change in environmental response from coming out or your physiological presence slowly reforming, you will act some what different.

Your probably gonna ask your self over and over if your trans, wondering if this is right for you. I think it's normal and for the record I don't think a lot of CiS gendered people ask if they're CiS. I think most Transgender (that I've met) people have questioned hard if they're trans or not. 

It's up to you to educate your health care professionals. Come prepared with quantifiable data you can vet by peer reviewed sources. If they don't feel comfortable giving you care, challenge them. You deserve treatment.

There's probably more but I'm tired and emotionally exhausted. Please keep in mind I probably face less challenges then a lot of other girls. I live in western Canada. I just wanted to get this out in front of people who are starting HRT. It's a ride. Hold on.

2016-10-26 04:38:19,59fpx9,69,0,"Hi,

I want to start off by saying that I have no ill intent in posting here, I'm just trying to start a little conversation to get a little bit from each of your points of view. If anything I say or ask comes off as rude or insensitive, please let me know.

I have a hard time buying into the concept of a gender identity. When it comes to sexual orientation, it makes sense to me that a human being can be inherently attracted to the opposite sex. Sex is a natural function and although homosexual sex is an evolutionary dead end, it makes perfect sense to me that a man can inherently be attracted to other men (and the same for women) without the influence of society affecting that feeling.

With a gender identity, however, you must first come to the conclusion that gender is a social construct, otherwise you'd be admitting the notion that gender is a natural state, which implies that there is a normal for gender (the normal being Man and Woman since those correspond with the two natural sexes). And if you say that Man and Woman are the natural states of gender, then you invalidate any idea that being transgender or nonbinary could be seen as a normal thing.

However, if you come to the conclusion that gender is a social construct then you must also come to the conclusion that being trans is not something you naturally are, but rather an idea that you got from deviating from society's norms of gender. The reason I bring this up is because there's so much struggle that comes along with being anything besides the two popular genders. Why assign yourself as a label like ""Transwoman"" when you could instead just be ""A person who's a male that happens to like things society deems feminine"". It seems to me that there's no reason for there to be as many labels as there are when it comes to gender, since gender is a totally fabricated idea to begin with.

Ok, so, excuse me if this is very jumbled. I'm not the best at wording.
But almost every time I've seen/heard/read about etc people talking about what it means to be gender fluid, they basically say something along the lines of ""sometimes I wear guy clothes, sometimes I wear girl clothes, and sometimes I wear both"".
But those same people also talk about wanting gender neutral things and want to remove the idea of assigned gender at birth, and to stop dressing children in clothes that fit their 'birth gender' because they cant communicate their feelings etc.
And isn't that entirely contradicting?
Maybe I've just completely misunderstood and or I'm hearing information from the wrong people, but it seems as though the entire identity is based on gendered things, even though you/they don't believe in gendered things. How can you wear girl clothes and boy clothes, if they are neither? If you bought them, arent they just your clothes? Seriously correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm trying my best to understand it, but I find it difficult to undertand personally, because some days i wear dresses and some days i wear baggy shirts and jeans, but I don't feel as though I'm gender fluid.
