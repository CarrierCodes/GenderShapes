as of right now, ive been closeted for almost 2 years, and the stress of it added onto preexisting anxiety is making it so hard to function properly that i cant make it through a day without stressing to the point of almost blacking out. this has been happening for just over a year, but my dad refuses to believe that anythings wrong with his ""perfectly healthy daughter"" (sorry dad, but im not your daughter, and im nowhere near healthy) and that im just overreacting. ive been too scared to tell him that i think a lot of these issues im having are because im trans, or at the very least making these issues worse.

because of school issues where courses i need for college are being discontinued (im trying to get into art school btw), ive been seriously considering applying to the art high school downtown to finish those credits. this school i at least know is incredibly accepting and i wont have to worry about my identity being an issue there. 

in the event that i dont get into the program, ill be stuck at my current school (which isnt nearly as accepting as they like to say they are) and forced into coming out there.

tl;dr - i have to come out to transphobic parents in order to get therapy (which they dont believe in) and into the school i want to go to, and have no fucking clue what im supposed to do and im terrified

On the streetcar today there was a man dressed in a man's coat and baseball cap, with lipstick and eye makeup and pumps. I don't know whether he was trans.

I felt compelled to say something to him. A couple of people who got on the streetcar gave him funny looks, and I wanted to say something along the lines of, 'I hope you don't find this invasive. I just wanted to let you know that I think it's really cool and brave of you to be exactly who you are. It takes a lot of courage.'

I wrestled the whole ride with whether to say anything, and I didn't. I'd like to know - would this have been appropriate? My intention was to make him feel good and comfortable. But I can also imagine that it would put him on the spot and make him more aware of the fact that he looks different.

she asked me for a cigarette, and started talking about how horrible is to be in the streets going up to cars of unknown people who she don’t know if this gonna be the time when she gonna have a horrible situation or may not.

she told me is hard this work because of the addiction of money, they can live as persons, not as the most of the works which sometimes is hard to eat, and plus of that you have to live in a shitty place.

she told me the prostitute houses don’t take trans inside them, and at least this could be places where they are more safe,

she told me the normal jobs don’t take them not either :/ and because of that they are working there, in this, in the streets.

2016-12-02 21:14:57,5g5tjs,14,9,"Hello there! I come here, after reading a bit, with some questions.
In advance, I would like to apologize if any of my views or arguments come off as offensive. This is not what I mean with this post.

For some background, I am cis-male, 25 years old.
I'm not sure(As many other users on this subreddit and other sites) if I may be transgeder, or if I just like the idea of crossdressing, be it because I find femenine clothing more appealing, or because I maybe want to be a girl.

Now, I don't have any kind of dysphoria, and I am quite happy with my body. But I always liked better the idea of being a girl. Traditionally girly things were always more appealing to me(And still are). Whenever I get to pick a character, I go for the girl, be it in videogames, LARP, tabletop RPGs...
This alone could mean literally nothing, and I know that. But since I hit puberty, I've been feeling a sense of longing, wishing I was born female instead. And the feeling doesn't go away.
I crossdress whenever I'm home alone, and I love every second of it(Although I'm affraid to go outside wearing skirts/dresses and such).

There's one thing that keeps pushing me back from even considering transitioning, and that is that our current medicine and technology wouldn't allow a full transition, as I'd like it to be. Some sort of brain transplant, for instance, where my mind is fully realocated within a female body. That would be perfect, although unrealistic.

Now comes the problematic part of this post, but please, bear with me. And if I'm wrong(I'm pretty sure I am!) please, do tell me. As I see it, transitioning is incomplete. No one can fully transition from their physical sex to another one. For instance, if I decided to fully transition, I would be almost 100% female in functionality, but I'd be missing out some parts of being female, such as periods, or pregnancy. And from my standpoint that just doesn't makes the cut.
Maybe I'm romanticizing the whole part of suffering monthly cramps, maybe someone who went through transitioning can steer me in the right direction.
Or maybe someone out here is just wishing to discuss things, and perhaps help me figure things out?

If you made it this far, I thank you for reading my rant.

2016-12-11 09:46:11,5hpeon,7,7,"Am I transgender or is this a fetish?

This is going for years now, like there would be a period i think i am trash, or just fap it away as a fetish and then there's a period i am fine with being gay and living my life. 
The trans thing mainly occurs when i see good looking passing trannies or s/fur shit.

There was a time when i was young that thought i was trans, like 16 years old, spend time reading stuff online and then forgot about it when i went to sleep, there there was another bigger later phase around when i was 22 thinking i am actually trans for like 1-2 months but then it passed once i realized it could just be some weird humiliation fetish since it often times also causes me sexual arousal thinking of being a woman.

I dont know if this is a real thing or just a fetish, i am probably also scared that if it is real i am fucked because my job is mainly male and trans isnt something widely accepted in some EU countries so there might be no way to actually do it financially and the future will be literally fucked. Plus i have a weird dislike of women who act slutty or manipulative, probably because i hate my mother for being an angry whiny bitch but that is another reason i dont feel i should be a girl.

The confusing thing is that most of the time i could not care less and feel no issues with being cis gay but every now and then, specifically when i come by some passing tranny or some female that looks attractive i feel like i would want to be a woman, then i usually just fap to some fantasy where i am the female and the thoughts go away for some time, can even be months without those feelings.",trans,Am I transgender or is this a fetish?,1481474771.0,"{'created_utc': 1481449571, 'id': '5hpeon', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 7, 'selftext': ""Am I transgender or is this a fetish?\n\nThis is going for years now, like there would be a period i think i am trash, or just fap it away as a fetish and then there's a period i am fine with being gay and living my life. \nThe trans thing mainly occurs when i see good looking passing trannies or s/fur shit.\n\nThere was a time when i was young that thought i was trans, like 16 years old, spend time reading stuff online and then forgot about it when i went to sleep, there there was another bigger later phase around when i was 22 thinking i am actually trans for like 1-2 months but then it passed once i realized it could just be some weird humiliation fetish since it often times also causes me sexual arousal thinking of being a woman.\n\nI dont know if this is a real thing or just a fetish, i am probably also scared that if it is real i am fucked because my job is mainly male and trans isnt something widely accepted in some EU countries so there might be no way to actually do it financially and the future will be literally fucked.

I don't know any trans people, so I was hoping to get an idea of your thoughts on some of this.

1. Why do you feel the suicide rate is so high? One side suggests mental illness (suicide rates after about the same pre/post-op) while the other points to bullying. 

2. Do you think colleges should ban Milo from speaking, given what he said? (The outrage appears to be at his joke about having sex with this person, but I may be misunderstanding fully where the outrage is coming from)

My boyfriend just told me he thinks he maybe trans. I finally flat out asked him because I had a feeling he might be. He gave me an opening and I took it. I'm pretty sure he was wanting me to ask. I can't imagine carrying that burden. 

His answer was, ""Maybe."" 

We had the conversation over a messaging app since we currently live in other countries and I imagine it was easier for him to talk about in that manner. 

I'll preface this that I've been a lifelong champion of the LGBTQ community. I fully understand gender and sex are two different things. 

But I feel like my heart has been shattered. I'm madly in love with him and I don't believe that will ever change. (I'm using male pronouns until he says he's sure this is what he wants) But, I'm in no way attracted to women. I wish I was in this case. But just like he can't change who he is, I can't change who I am. 

I told him I would support whatever he wanted to do. I told him I would be there every step of the way if this is what he ultimately decided to do. I also had to be honest, I don't think the sexual side of our relationship would continue. It would evolve into something else but that part would likely cease. 

He said he wouldn't do it if that was the case. I told him, ""You can't make that decision based on me. You'll just end up resenting me. If that's what you are then that's what you are...and if you're happier being a woman then that's what you need to be. I'll still love you. That will never change. But I also can't change what I'm attracted to.""

Now he says he only wants to have the top surgery but not the bottom. I wouldn't be surprised if that eventually change because I'm wondering if there's a bit of denial going on. 

I guess I'm asking for guidance. He seems unsure and I want to be there for him on this journey. But, I have a feeling I'm going to end up breaking his heart because I can't continue our relationship in a physical sense. I wish I could but I can't. Which breaks my heart as well. 

I now have to spend Christmas with my family and pretend this isn't happening.

(I\'m using male pronouns until he says he\'s sure this is what he wants) But, I\'m in no way attracted to women. I wish I was in this case. But just like he can\'t change who he is, I can\'t change who I am. \n\nI told him I would support whatever he wanted to do. I told him I would be there every step of the way if this is what he ultimately decided to do. I also had to be honest, I don\'t think the sexual side of our relationship would continue. It would evolve into something else but that part would likely cease. \n\nHe said he wouldn\'t do it if that was the case. I told him, ""You can\'t make that decision based on me. You\'ll just end up resenting me. If that\'s what you are then that\'s what you are...and if you\'re happier being a woman then that\'s what you need to be. I\'ll still love you. That will never change. But I also can\'t change what I\'m attracted to.""\n\nNow he says he only wants to have the top surgery but not the bottom. I wouldn\'t be surprised if that eventually change because I\'m wondering if there\'s a bit of denial going on. \n\nI guess I\'m asking for guidance. He seems unsure and I want to be there for him on this journey. But, I have a feeling I\'m going to end up breaking his heart because I can\'t continue our relationship in a physical sense. I wish I could but I can\'t. Which breaks my heart as well. \n\nI now have to spend Christmas with my family and pretend this isn\'t happening. \n\nThank you to all who read this and offering any insight.
