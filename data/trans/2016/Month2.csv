Right now I have three trans youth I deal with day to day (2 post, 1 pre). They hate and reject anything I might say based solely on my race, and sexual preference. In three and a half weeks, I have not finished a sentence, let alone a session of counselling (which is done individually). I'm white and hetero, what can I ever help with?

How do I breach this barrier with them? You all know we cannot change who we are. I AM ME---I know this does not devalue the love and effort I have/will give. I want them to understand that the person beneath my skin and my sexual preference has nothing to do with my skills, dedication and love for my job.

I'm (currently) a 24-year-old man with a wife and a 6-month-old son. I've fantasized about being a woman since junior high, but I've had little opportunity to indulge my fantasies, growing up in a conservative Christian household (I'm now Pagan). My wife knows, and she's bi, but I'm pretty sure she would have a hard time if I chose to go consistently feminine even part-time. I'm also concerned about the impact on my son if I switch around or fully transition. Obviously, there's potential for discrimination, loss of friends and family, and issues with work in store for me too (currently unemployed).

To make matters more difficult, I've got a bass voice, stick-like figure, masculine arms and legs, and a desire to keep my original sex organs. I'm not even sure if I want to grow my hair out and/or shave my limbs, because I don't know how much of the time I want to be which gender. I have a wig and makeup, plus some clothes, but I rarely get to use any of it.

Without stepping into the mind-fuck that is social constructs, or the fact that this sentiment (X makes you gay) already has homophobic underpinnings that shouldn't be there in the first place, the opinion of men on trans-girls has a huge impact on (straight/pan/bi/+) trans-women's dating lives.

I can help you to feminize your voice.

- I am using my own methodology which is based on approach that is personal. 
  It means that I do not stick to one method with everybody, but rather try to figure out what works for you personally.

- I am sure that anybody can feminize their voice.
  Depending on skill and diligence the process can take from month to half a year.

- And it is affordable.
  Any other voice feminization tutor will charge you twice as much. And will try for as long as he can - to keep you paying.

I ask for 11$ per lesson. One lesson lasts for 45 minutes. The best schedule is three lessons per week, but we can arrange any routine that suits you best.

First lesson is free and you pay only after the lessons.

I am available from 8am till 8pm UTC+0.

Here are my posts on transvoice subreddit when I did it for free: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/3qu91b/voice_feminization_help/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/3kds9k/voice_feminization_help/)

A little background:
My parents have always expressed their dissatisfaction towards homosexuality through their heavily Catholic views.
I don't think my parents understand the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation.
Regardless, I identify as transgender and pansexual (which my parents will more than likely just think of me as a homosexual abomination).
When I was younger, they often questioned me about being gay and told me they would get me ""help"" if I needed it, I.e. Send me to some sort Catholic retreat/school or whatever.

Of course I always too afraid to tell them how I really inside.

I'm a 23 years old now and would like to my live my life how I want for once.

2016-02-24 21:22:17,47f0ku,24,10,"Hey, all, 21F here. 
All my life I've been pretty tomboyish as far as hobbies (wrestling and baseball with brothers as a kid, archery,) go, and then in high school I would rather build set pieces than spend my summer at girl friends' houses or swimming or wherever. Dressing up for dances or ceremonies was always awkward because I think suits look more appealing than dresses, which always make me feel self conscious. 

At one point in high school I believe I had depression and developed anxiety issues. I still have the anxiety, but the depression-like feelings went away when I felt better about myself. When I lost a lot of weight (not being hungry, only eating Ramen, and always being busy helped) and gained noticeable biceps from doing technical theater I felt great. 

Now that I'm older and out of my religious mother's house, I've been able to buy men's clothes and it feels so good to wear baggy cargo pants or a v-neck, even though my bosom is DD in size. I'm still okay with dressing more feminine (like jean styles or cute cardigans), but really dislike my body image in girly clothes, identifying as more of a frumpy mom stylistically. Often when I look in the mirror, I try to stand in such a way that hides my generous chest, or just ignore my chest and look at the rest of me, determining whether I am passable or wondering how I would look as a male. 

For the last two years I've kept my hair short or shaved on at least one side and I liked that contrast for a while; it reflected how I feel. Last night though, I shaved all of it down to the same length again and came to a conclusion I've had before- 

This isn't the first time I knew I looked like a boy (due to my hair). I don't mind being mistaken for one; it's kind of exciting.  Looking in the mirror though, I do have a cute fem face. I like my face. It's not that I'm disappointed exactly, but I can't stop wondering how I would feel about myself if I were male with the broader jawline and more pronounced, hardened features.
