2016-08-01 18:42:41,4vo1zo,8,11,"So let me give you my background. I was born male and am currently living as a cis male but to understand my story I have to begin from when I was much younger.

Somewhere around 1st grade I realized I was more comfortable being around my girl cousins I'd rather play with Barbies and doll houses than action figures and toy guns like my brothers. And my family never minded, I wasn't purchased any for myself but never scolded for playing with my cousins. And I began to realize I was different.

In second grade a new toy came out they were like mini makeup kits for girls to play with and boy did I want one. I saved up my allowance for a few weeks and asked my mom to take me to Kay-Bee toys to buy a toy. But when she saw what I was looking at she kind of harshly convinced me that those toys weren't for me. And that was the moment I not only realized that I didn't fit in with boys but felt that I needed to hide how I felt. 

Late in elementary school and beginning of junior high I began to understand that I had a gender identity issue but I was also painfully aware of gender norms and that if I came out of the closet I had a serious risk of being alienated so I kept it hidden. Even hiding I would often get picked on for being feminine and oddly enough the insult that was thrown at me that hurt the most was ""dyke"" because it was a reminder and a ridicule toward what I wished I was.

What was both a blessing and a curse for me was that I was attracted to women not men. It allowed me to have a ""normal"" dating life in Jr and Sr high without outing myself. But I never felt 100% fulfilled. 

Dating was also confusing for me because when I was younger it was really hard for me to figure out if I wanted to 'be' or 'be with' who ever I was currently crushing on.

As I got older and had serious relationships I would inform my significant other about my Identity issues and was lucky to be with people who were always accepting or at worst understanding never judged.

Fast forward to now I'm 29 years old living as a man, Married (happily I adore my wife) and a father(I love. While I'm happy with my life I sometimes just hurt over this. I feel I've lived as a man too long and couldn't handle the change.(I'm a creature of habit) but I always feel as if I live in a body that's not mine. 

My wife wants me to talk about this stuff with her but I don't always feel comfortable. It's a touchy subject for me as it is and when she asks me things I feel more like I'm being interviewed for a mix of entertainment and self assurance on her part not for my needs.

So I'm 22 and currently (outwardly) identify as male, though I've been fighting dysphoria more or less since I can remember. During highschool I 'came out' to my mother who, although supportive, didn't really understand and wouldn't help in any regard other than giving me rides to and from therapy. I only went to therapy for a few months before extenuating circumstances meant I had to stop, and me still being pretty young and frankly very scared, I stopped altogether.  
  
I had never started HRT but I had forms and some clothes I wore when I could but living with my parents made that very difficult. Over the years I just suppressed everything as best I could and tried to move on. I was doing fairly well (as well as I could at least) until last year when things hit me hard again. I went thru a short phase, now that I'm on my own, where whenever I was home I'd wear forms and whatever I was comfortable with for clothes but I since had a bit of a mental breakdown after a particularly difficult day and threw everything away :( Ever since I've had those ups and downs where I would get really determined and then super defeated.  
  
In spite of this I'm slowly starting to try and face the problem again and work towards something healthy but when I look in the mirror all I can focus on is how 'manly' I look with my beard and being covered in body hair. I hate it. It's not me. I guess I just need some advice. Reassurance? I feel like this is an impossible task for me and I don't know if that's normal. I've never had any trans friends so I've never had anyone to share in the experience with.

I recently came out to my wife and a few close friends about feeling I was trans, was repressed and in denial until coming out to my wife during an argument. Since then I've been embracing my feelings and I pretty much switch into girl clothes the moment I get home and feel happier than ever doing it.

Prior to coming out I had been very depressed over the last year and really overweight. Nothing brought me happiness, I only looked for escapes and my feeling of dysphoria was worse than ever. Unfortunately one of the escapes and something that in a way was dealing with the dysphoria was watching porn. I've never enjoyed porn and in the eyes of my wife and I watching it is pretty much cheating. For some reason watching it made me feel feminine and kinda helped repress the dysphoria, but also made things worse, eventually I would just become super jealous of the women in the video for being something I felt I could never achieve.

I admitted to the porn watching to my wife during an argument, as that escalated and I began to think why I was watching the porn, that was when I realized everything in the previous paragraph.

Non-binary: gender pronouns don't matter to me. I am going to be MtF hopefully soon. I'm excited and nervous as I'm not insured for it.

It's nice to meet you all.

I'm feeling a bit down because of dating. I'm gonna be very put off from dating for a long time until I move from my hometown. I feel like growing a pair of breasts is gonna gain me a heck of a notice in the male booby fandom. So I decided I won't date anyone from my hometown because of that. But I've read a lot of stuff about how it is hard. I know I can't stop anyone from feeling any kind of way that is uncertain about dating trans.

I feel like if I ask her to give me an early birthday present and help me pay for this she'll just get really mad and put the, ""UH YOU JUST WANT ME TO PAY FOR IT ALL AND BLAH BLAH. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO PAY FOR AND YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO NOT GET PRESENTS ANY MORE AND YOU HAVE A JOB GO PAY FOR IT YOURSELF!"". I don't know. I don't care what she thinks, I just care that she'll outright refuse to help me in anyway. I haven't come out to all of my family because I don't care what they think either.

So I decided I won\'t date anyone from my hometown because of that. But I\'ve read a lot of stuff about how it is hard. I know I can\'t stop anyone from feeling any kind of way that is uncertain about dating trans. But you know, I don\'t know if I should feel more empowered or not. Also I\'ve been kind of sad that I feel like my mom won\'t like it that I\'m gonna transition. I have told her just to give her a heads up but she wasn\'t too happy about it. I feel like if I ask her to give me an early birthday present and help me pay for this she\'ll just get really mad and put the, ""UH YOU JUST WANT ME TO PAY FOR IT ALL AND BLAH BLAH. YOU DON\'T UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO PAY FOR AND YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO NOT GET PRESENTS ANY MORE AND YOU HAVE A JOB GO PAY FOR IT YOURSELF!"". I don\'t know. I don\'t care what she thinks, I just care that she\'ll outright refuse to help me in anyway. I haven\'t come out to all of my family because I don\'t care what they think either. My dad is not going to get to know because he just thinks I\'m girly because my mom didn\'t tell me that that\'s not ok??? So yeah, he\'s out of the loop. But it\'s been pretty taxing. I just don\'t know what to think at the moment. I am going to Chicago to get it done. Does anyone know the cost of an uninsured transition visit? I would really like to know. It would put me at ease so much.\n\nIf you had to go at this uninsured, tell me. I don\'t want to feel left out or just completely blind. \n\nThank you if you\'ve read it all. Also thank you for taking your time to help me. I don\'t get enough of it here.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""Hello /r/trans! I've been lurking for awhile and I've finally had the guts to post.

I'm 20 years old, living in Denmark. I don't really care that much about what people think of me or the decisions i make. But one thing really bothers me. I have a hard time understanding what i want with life, and pretty much everything to do with gender/my body. I often have the feeling of wanting to be more femminin, girly, etc.
Wearing girl clothing feels nice and i'm a pretty slim person (not in a bad way) so i think it looks pretty good, generally i just feel better when i wear female or unisex clothing. But on the other hand, i really like to do stereotypical guy stuff, go to the gym to get stronger, the type of clothing, etc. 
I have thought about being a girl for many years, but i'm not sure if i should actually should do it; One of my main issues is that i think i only feel this way while i'm young, and when i'm older (40-50), i won't have those feelings anymore. I have a hard time imagining myself reaching mid-late adulthood as a women.

So yeah; My main problem is that i'm struggling with how things will be in the future, for now i just don't know. What if i'm just idolizing the female body in its 20's, and will regret my decision once i grow older? But if i don't decide soon, will i have started too late and be too old to pass as a women?
I might get kicked out by my family if i decide to do it (still live at home at the moment), but that's not that big of a problem because i own a tent. 

I'm open to any kind of advice, right now i'm pretty much out of ideas. I had a good friend i wanted to ask about this, but because of personal reasons we sadly don't talk anymore.

Over the 5 years I've wanted to shout out ""I'm transgender"" but worries about the relationship coming to an end have stopped me, that and I've never told anyone before.

Anyway, I had Whisper on my phone and a Whisper I posted ages ago about being trans and not knowing how to come out and she found it.

At first I denied it hoping it would go away but she made me crack and spill the beans.

I knew I likely wouldn't retain skin sensation, even though we took precautions to retain as much as possible. As a diabetic, not being able to feel a part of my body is the scariest thing I can imagine. I thought I was prepared for how I would feel post-op.

2016-08-16 11:29:44,4xz0hq,6,24,"This happened a few days ago but I've kinda been processing it.

There's a Cheddar's within walking distance of my apartment. There's also a Pokestop and a gym there. I will sometimes walk down there, order a few overpriced drinks, and get a little tipsy as I spin the pokestop and level the gym (Go team Valor! ^_^) Anyway, as usual, I forgot my ID and this time they decided I couldn't order without it.

So I walked back to my apartment, and as I was walking I noticed a police car behaving oddly. First, it pulled over and stopped right near me. I hesitated, but they didn't roll down their window turn on their lights, or otherwise try to get my attention, so I just kept walking. This area near my apartment was a Y intersection and I was walking up the foot of the Y, with my apartment on the left arm. The police car pulled up, went down that left arm to the end (past my apartment) and I thought I was in the clear, but they turned around and came back. They stopped at the stop sign and just..sat there. Way, way too long.

I was starting to get nervous by this point. I'm autistic and have PTSD from my time in the army, so someone clearly stalking me was triggering enough, but someone behaving in a way counter to expectations was driving me near breakdown. I was raised white, upper middle class, cis, and male, with ""neuroatypical"" being my only real point of marginalization. Of course this meant that I was taught the police are my friend, I should always trust the police, and if I have nothing to hide I have nothing to worry about. I've since learned enough about the world to question those assumptions, but I've never *experienced* it, you know?

I took a shortcut past the police car and into my apartment complex while trying to act natural. That's easy enough because I do take the shortcut sometimes, just not often in heels. I went into my apartment to get my ID and it took me a minute to find it. When I came back out, my fears were confirmed and the police car was sitting outside.

Now I'm going to give the officer credit here. From this point on he was very polite. Not perfect, mind you, but I could tell he was trying. He addressed me as...basically the original third option from Fallen London, ""Si...er...ma'...er...yes,"" which was amusing because he clearly was not referencing it intentionally. I corrected him to ""ma'am"" and he used from then on. He said that they were looking for a ""Troy"" who...again, he struggled before settling on, ""fit your description."" He asked my name, I told him. I first told him my new name, then realized that might confuse the information he'd already gotten off his computer so I gave him my old name (I don't consider it a dead name).

He asked me if I lived here, and then asked me for ID (thank God I'd just gotten it!) It doesn't have my current hair color, let alone my real gender (2 years, 4 months respectively). To break tension I joked that ""The license is a liiittle out of date. I dyed my hair since then."" He laughed, gave me back my license, thanked me, and we were both on our separate ways.

I've been thinking about this incident and decided to post about it not as a complaint about being hassled by the police, but just an observation that this has *never* happened in my entire privileged life to this point. I've never been stopped because I fit a description. Up until now, I've been nondescript. And I can't shake this feeling that the Troy they were looking for probably looks absolutely nothing like me except being a trans woman. Probably black, just for irony's sake here.

When you're used to privilege, it feels like oppression to be treated like everyone else. Is my sudden ability to ""fit a description,"" oppression, or just lack of previously held privilege? I don't know, but now I'm more wary of police cars. If it happens again, and I have a sinking feeling it will, next officer might not even try to be polite.

2016-08-23 01:44:24,4z42cd,5,17,"I'm met my trans boyfriend on December 29th 2015. We have been together for almost 8 months. He has been on T for 18 months. Before I met him I had considered myself a lesbian for the last 15 years. I'm currently unsure what to consider myself now I am completely in love with this guy. I'm not usually one to label but I do have a rainbow tattoo that means Pride on my arm very visible to anybody who shakes my hand. I met him and my whole life has changed. We have both been married and divorced myself once and him twice. I have met his family and they are amazing I have never been so welcomed  by family before my whole life. He has three brothers and his mother and father. He has adorable nieces and nephews. And we have huge plans for our future.

I have a question for anybody out there who is with someone who is trans or has advice... or just anyone with advice. I fell in love with him almost instantly. Even though he is nothing like anybody I have ever met before. I am very protective of him and his feelings which may seem a little odd. But one of the things that gets me the most is when people call him by the wrong gender or the wrong name. I know that for most it is still routine from the life he used to have. But when I heard today that his co-workers who have only known him as he is now... They have called him she. Even though he has been on T for 18 months he hasn't exactly grown as much facial hair as he wished he had. I know that he will feel much more masculine when that happens but until then how do I keep myself from wanting to kick the ass of someone who offends him.. knowing how he wished to be addressed and still going against it. (Not his family however when they still call him by his birth name or say she or sister I don't correct them but I don't change how I address him) 
I have never worn so many girly shoes girly pants and outfits and makeup and done my hair so much before I met him. But I have found that when I do he is called Sir more often and is gender dysphoria isn't so rough on him. He claims it's because they are paying more attention to me. And not so much to him.

I know this is kind of a long post and thank you for taking your time to read it. I have a bit of a hard time with this stuff sometimes just because it is new to me 8 months is not a very long time. I am so in love with him. I just want to make it easier for him. Is there anything else I can do for him.

2016-08-28 22:11:38,501pps,1,14,"Let me know if this isn't the proper place for this particular issue, but it's definitely the subreddit that I figured I'd have the most luck finding a response.

For a great deal of my life, I've struggled with dysphoria between my assigned gender (male) and my gender identity (if not fully female, then at least somewhere on that part of the spectrum). However, through all my years, I've become more painfully aware of the fact that steps toward aligning more with my gender identity (facial hair removal/body hair reduction/etc) are relatively impossible with how my body is. In short, I generally loathe my body, and it makes me very uncomfortable to be seen in it because I don't like the fact that people automatically associate me with masculinity when they see me.

For this reason, as I've grown older, it's become more and more difficult to actually get OUT there and do things. Being constantly aware that my body is not what I want it to be has led to an enormous amount of awareness of several things, but particularly, my issue here is this: I take up space and am ashamed of doing so because I don't like the way that I occupy that space. For my whole life I have done my best to make myself small and gone out of my way to never manspread or anything like that because I am all the more spatially conscious and want to be perceived as small, but being 6'2"" makes it very difficult to not be noticed, and it makes it exceptionally difficult to be seen as anything but male when everything about you screams ""MAN!"" 

I have attempted to lessen this masculine presentation numerous times through different measures, but my body seems to have some kind of vendetta against any kind of process that would make this easier for me. Laser hair removal and other processes like that do not work on my hair type, and despite all my attempts at minimizing body hair by other means, I've been ""blessed""/(cursed) by remarkably fast growing hair that is noticeable even when I shave. (In addition, every time I shave I break out with ingrown hairs and acne flare-ups, but that's just because I have godawful genetics that lead to sensitive skin). In short, no matter what I've tried (clothing-wise or physically), I cannot minimalise my masculine presentation to a point where I am comfortable in my body.

For this reason, I have a great deal of trouble being in public spaces, because the more people there are around me, the more aware I am that I am taking up space that could be used for someone else, an the more aware I am that people actually notice me. I can't go with my boyfriend to clubs anymore because whenever I go, I immediately have to escape the crowded atmosphere because my self-consciousness paralyzes me. I would pursue less crowded situations, but in those cases, I tend to simply feel lonely. This has led to a worsening of previous depressive habits of hiding away and trying to not be seen or to go places where I will be seen, which is really hard for someone like myself who is enormously extroverted in nature.

What I want to know is whether other people have gotten over issues like this before, and perhaps how I can work toward being more comfortable being in public. I am not content just sitting in the house, but I don't know the first steps to take to start to be comfortable in public spaces.",trans,Dyshoria leading to inability to socialize,1472447498.0,"{'created_utc': 1472422298, 'id': '501pps', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 14, 'selftext': 'Let me know if this isn\'t the proper place for this particular issue, but it\'s definitely the subreddit that I figured I\'d have the most luck finding a response.\n\nFor a great deal of my life, I\'ve struggled with dysphoria between my assigned gender (male) and my gender identity (if not fully female, then at least somewhere on that part of the spectrum).
