2016-03-04 20:55:17,48z9h8,4,2,"I am hoping that this is a good place to post this, but if there is a better Reddit, please let me know. Also, while I read Reddits regularly, this is my first attempt at a post, so I apologize if I mess anything up formatting-wise.

I am a 31 year old who was born male, I have a wonderful wife, a solid career as an editor and community college instructor, and a wonderful 4-month old son. For the most part, my life is great, but certain feelings have been rather persistent now that my life finally feels in order. 

When I was younger (as young as anywhere between 5 and 10) I used to always imagine what my life would be like if I was a girl instead of a boy. I played with toys meant for both genders--I had my Ninja Turtles and loved them, but I also played with my sister's Barbie dolls. I would imagine myself as the female characters in cartoons as much as the male characters (really, more so--I preferred to pretend I was Apirl O'Neil rather than any of the turtles for instance). I would go to sleep praying that I would wake up a girl even. And, yes, sometimes I snuck my sister's or mother's clothes when I was alone. 

All of that seemed to leave when I hit puberty though. I would still have the thoughts once in a while, but not nearly as much--maybe once every few months for a bit. New issues arose as I started to realize that my sexuality was not exactly the ""norm"" either. My first hard crush was on a guy friend of mine. Long story short, I discovered I was bisexual. All those child-hood thoughts were pushed aside and I chalked it up to symptoms of my sexual identity as opposed to my gender identity. At most, I thought maybe I just admired women's clothes or even fetishized them or something.

Not long after, I met the woman who is now my wife, a beautiful woman that I am very much attracted to and in love with. Fast forward another decade and I have a career, a marriage, and a kid, but now my thoughts of being a woman have resurfaced hard. To the point, even, that I became very depressed.

My wife bothered me until I spilled the beans. This was only just a week ago, so my life feels like it is entering a whole new whirlwind. Strangely though, I felt a lot of relief having confided these feelings in her--especially when she said she wanted to support me. I'm not feeling depressed like I was before, but the feelings (I guess dysphoria?) are still there, and I find myself questioning my gender identity more and more. 

On the outside, I am very masculine in appearance despite having a few feminine mannerisms. I had a beard up until recently (all the guys in my family do so I did too), stand 6'1"", and have pretty firm muscles. But something just doesn't feel like it fits. I don't think I could ever be ""girly,"" but I can't help but imagine having a feminine figure, breasts, hips, the whole nine yards. 

I just imagine I would be a tomboy--but why would I want to be a tomboy if I was born male? That is what is so confusing. I don't know what to do exactly. 

I come from a family that barely accepts my sexuality, so I know they wouldn't this. It's hard to experiment with it too since my wife's mother lives with us. I feel trapped and the depression, though briefly assuaged by my confession to my wife, seems like it will return. 

What I want to know is if anyone out there has had a similar experience? I am sure that is a silly question, as I am sure someone has; however, perspective from those with such a similar experience would be very helpful to me I think.

My wife agrees that I should probably see a therapist, and I would like to once I am able to find one that will accept my insurance--unfortunately my job's insurance requires I contact them first and I am afraid they are going to pry into why I need a therapist. She also wants to stay with me, and wants to try if I do end up transitioning, though we both sort of know things would not work out. She is bi-curious, but it does not go beyond curiosity. 

Again, please let me know if there is a better place to post this and ask this question.

2016-03-31 23:14:17,4csmux,2,11,"So I've been operating under the assumption that everything was going to be okay. That I would be able to get my surgery and I was trying really, really hard to get everything set up for it. However, apparently, my therapist didn't write my letter, even though she asked me if I wanted her to ""get started on that letter"", and I said yes. So no letter was available in the first place.

However, she won't write another letter for me (she doesn't even acknowledge our past conversation about it), because I had a suicide attempt, which isn't something I usually do. I tried to kill myself because my best and only close friend (and ex-boyrfriend) said he didn't want to speak to me ever again, and blocked me on everything, and I thought this was the one time where he would be serious about it—that we wouldn't make up the next day like usual.  He's too important for me to lose. I felt like the worst friend ever.

After the cops took me to the ER, the crisis counselor didn't seem to think there was any danger of hurting myself if they released me. I talked to my dad about it, and some of my other friends. Me and my best friend eventually made up over it and everything is fine. Everything is okay. Nothing is wrong. I'm fine. I don't understand how this is still a big deal after it's been resolved. I don't feel like hurting myself anymore, and I'm not going to try again even if he gets angry and throws this same fit again.

I'm usually not like this. I'm not usually this impulsive, and I don't self-harm with any regularity. I'm otherwise stable—I don't use drugs anymore, I have a job, I have friends, my depression/anxiety/OCD/etc. are under control, etc.  My parents live where I'm going to get the surgery, so I have social supports there and here. I have a place to go after surgery. Everything is in place. I'm already working on trying to get my electrolysis done.

I've been waiting for this my entire life, and I thought I was going to get it next year, but with that single stupid moment of mine, I threw it away. I'm so tired of waiting for this stupid surgery. This stupid condition took away my entire enjoyment of my childhood and early adulthood, and I'm never going to be able to get pregnant or have children or be a mom, and now I have to wait even longer for even the smallest relief from this stupid curse.

Now I have to wait an indefinite amount of time before I can get letters written for me, to make sure I'm ""psychologically stable"", but I was already stable. I'm still stable. I just had one moment of impulsivity and pain and sadness in my otherwise okay life. I was so excited looking forward to surgery next year, but now I have no idea how long it's going to take for me to get it. Again. Waiting again, for who know's how long. I'm so tired of it.
