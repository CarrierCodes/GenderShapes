We hung out a few times had food, went to a bar and (annoyingly) ended up more friends than anything, I knew I was his type a handsome faced bear. We are even planning to start going to the gym together, anyway last weekend we went out in Boston, club café, and boy oh boy was he popular getting woofed at and bought drinks, proposed to (yes he's that cute) it was surreal, I stopped drinking after Cuba libre 2 and decided I had to drive and started eating pizza, FF to end of the night he's saying bye to a sweaty bear and passing out in the passenger seat, and hour drive back home. 

On the drive I was using his phone for GPS and he's out like OUT, out. And I invaded his privacy really really badly and snooped through his phone, first pictures, I thought I bet he takes dick pics all the time, and sure there was a couple, but mostly there were pics of a MTF girl with blonde had and smokey eyes and.... Oh my god... It was him, I was shocked and then our friendship started to make sense when I remember in the past that he's asked me in very subtle and joking ways if I would ever transition, and I said no never I like being a boy (takes shot) and when we first met I remember the question if I would date a trans MTF I also said no I wouldn't. But these questions were easy to miss only happened once each time and I feel like a piece of shit.

Second I looked through his texts and a few of them confirmed what I saw in the pics, some late night hook ups and some really heartbreaking stuff to asshole one night stands.

I hate myself for snooping and while what I said still stands as far as my preferences go, I can't help but feel protective of him I wish he would tell me, I'm afraid if I admit to what I did that he'll stop talking to me, I know I would.

Things like how a women or man should act, feel, dress or think. That one must drastically change their appearance to conform to socially acceptable ideas of masculinity/feminist. I'm sure most do it for themselves and not to please anyone or get attention. As a fellow human I truly wish to believe that. But to say you identify as a woman or a man... What does that mean? Does saying, I want to look like a woman or feel like a man make any sense if you disregard the act of sex? 

I don't believe anyone who says they understand what a trans person is going through who isn't trans or a mental health specialist. How could they? I admit I don't understand what gender identity is and based on what I've read, you would need a degree to even begin to.
I can understand homosexuality on a level to where I'll defend it. However when one gender says they want to live as another, isn't that purely aesthetic? 

Hypothetically if a father comes out as trans and their child asks why their daddy looks like that, is it appropriate to say because that makes him feel better? If the child asks why again what would you say.
I am in no way trying to say trans people shouldn't be parents or live a life they want to. A good parent is a good parent. I'm just calling into question the affect of a person changing their appearance to feel comfortable with themselves and accepted by others. Is one dependent on the other?

Do you feel pride in the fact that you are specifically a trans woman, or are you (just as I am) simply proud to be female?

2016-09-16 08:21:55,530xmh,2,11,"I'm not sure where else to put this. 

I'm writing this from my phone on the bed of a hospital gurney. 

I'm active duty military, united States Navy for 4 years (5 in Oct). I've suspected myself of having gender dysphoria for over two years after the recommendation of a friend, but have only recently begun to look into it and actually seek help. 

Too little too late. 

I went behind my command's back because I didn't want anyone to know, and have been seeking out help for the last few days. I had a psych evaluation on the 26th (still do I think). 

Until yesterday my mom and a few close friends were the only ones that knew I was possibly trans. I say possibly even though it's there without a doubt in my mind after much consideration over the last two years only because I haven't been properly diagnosed. Gender dysphoria may not be the only thing that's wrong with me, as I have plenty of anger issues, and anxiety issues. Something along the lines of borderline personality disorder. Something that i personally (though I'm not a doctor, so this is just opinion) believe is not directly related to my dysphoria, while there are a lot of things that are associated with my dysphoria. 

Anyway the past few days have been really hard for me. Starting with my attempts to seek out help, I first went to the active duty chaplain, which took me two months to finally find the courage to go see. I didn't feel comfortable mentioning my dysphoria to someone religious, but I did understand that he was there to help regardless of the problem, so while talking to him, which was over hundred percent guaranteed to be confidential, I explained most of my issues regarding possible BPD. Fourty minutes in and he resorted to recommending me to mental health professionals, and I had only just began to touch on my issues. 

The thing that had finally driven me to seek out help was urgings by the only friend I really consistently talk with anymore, who has had to deal with these kinds of things before with their trans sister. My other friends were all driven away by my out bursts recently. One of these friends, who I cared for deeply, was driven to suicide by my hateful words. Someone that cared for them was telling them to kill themselves. That's where I drew the line. Luckily they didn't go through with it, but they were staring down the barrel of a gun because of me and my instabilities. 

I went to see military mental health specialists, but unfortunately I was unable to see an actual doctor because as you can imagine the Navy and the military in general is filled with fucked up people, thus all the doctors were booked until the 26th. Life creeps up on you when you barely make 30k a year working more than anyone else will their whole lives over the course of a few years. 

I joined the Navy to ""man up"". To get stronger, mentally and physically. It's only served to do the opposite. I've always been a bit of a weakling, especially in my own eyes. My lack of masculinity was a crippling self esteem issue. No matter how hard I tried no matter how thin or bulked up I would get, though, I never was any happier with how I looked. Even dressing nice as a male was never really ever satisfying. 

Sorry to change topics out of no where but I've been playing video games online via the PC since I was a teen. I've played girl characters the whole way. Not because I was a pervy kid and liked tits and ass as much as I tried to convince myself that was the reason, but it was because that's who I wanted to be. Video games were a huge source of escape for me. I was your typical computer nerd, as anti social as they come. In game I was bubbly and happy as could be though. If it weren't for my tendency to push people away I think I would have turned out to be a rather popular person. 

Anyway back to the main point. Maybe I'll edit this later and put more in. 

The reason I'm on a hospital bed tonight writing this on a throwaway account is because I attempted to take my own life the night prior (the 14th). I didn't actually go through with it. All I had  to do it with was a knife, and when I went to cut my wrist open the long way, all I could do was scratch myself. I had lost all the strength in my body. The worst cut barely went into the skin and there wasn't even enough blood to be a big deal. My strength is actually still really questionable. Every day tasks are really hard for me, it's like when you're sick and your whole body just aches, and even just breathing is a chore. I tried to take a bandaid off the EMTs had put on my finger and I just couldn't do it. Or open a can of soda, for that matter. I'm not sure why this happened, and I sadly can't say that I feel fortunate that it turned out this way. 

It's taken a while to get through my head and actually turn into something meaningful, but my co-workers and friends were up all night searching for me. I had utterly trashed my room and written in mustard (as I'm writing this it's hilarious thinking about it in hindsight) on the walls and floor, my suicide note. ""Fuck my command, I'm going to kill myself"".

By the way the reason I flipped my shit is because I had failed room inspection of my barracks room. Not that big of a deal. The room wasn't necessarily dirty, just could be touched up here and there. Not a big deal. I've failed one before for less, like not having my closet locked up properly. In hindsight it was really ridiculous to flip out over such a thing, and to the level that I did. 

I threw cooking ingredients all over, broke a lot of stuff including mirrors and drawers, and slammed holes in the walls. Then I sent pictures of the mess to someone that was actually at work. I took two of my old iphones, one 4 and one 5s, threw them in the microwave and took off to get some McDonald's, it wasn't but a minute or two before the fire alarm went off, but luckily nothing bad happened. I looked in the kitchen area of the building and the microwave was still there, so luckily nothing bad came of it. Anyway I bought like fifty dollars worth of McDonald's and gorged myself. Oh and while I was trashing my room I downed like an eighth of a bottle of Smirnoff that I had been drinking over the last month or so, pretty much just finished it off. Didn't even show up in the blood work. 

Anyway I went out into a field where there is an obstacle course and hid there. Had my fifty dollar meal, and subsequently tried to kill myself, but couldn't. I was exhausted from the experience, and opted to just go to sleep. Slept for a couple hours on rocks dirt and dead grass, woke up a couple of times and heard people looking for me, even saw a helicopter do a couple passes. Guess I had a pretty good hiding spot. Wasnt until about one or two in the morning until my co-workers found me. The guy that I sent those pictures to had made a pretty big deal about all of this. For which I hope I can find it in myself to thank him but right now I just wish i was dead even more than before. 

Someone part of the LGBT community in our command, who I had reached out to anonymously in attempts to figure out tge Navy policies on transgender issuss, had even found out who I was (they knew who I was but didn't know my number and allowed me to stay anonymous)  and was also sending me texts throughout the whole thing. 


The only person I really talked to through all of this was my friend I mentioned with the trans sister. They were worried. Everyone was. I hate myself for doing this to them. Over something so pathetic. And acting so childishly. 

It was ridiculous how much they all cared. And how supportive they were of who I actually am. 

Anyway. 

Idk what the point of this was really.

# Every day I post an instance where /r/the_donald harassed or threatened violence against transgender individuals. Here's the subreddit stalking and harassing one individual person. 

The subreddit /r/the_donald found a photo of a person and then stalked and harassed this person. This person was just a bystander who they targeted because they believed they have the appearance of transgender person and they think they are ""ugly"". This person may not even be transgender but /r/the_donald labelled this person as transgender as bigoted motivation to stalk and harass them. No one deserves this.

This has clearly escalated way out of control. The subreddit started a hate campaign against a random bystander and promoted finding this person and taking photos and videos of them. This is dangerous behavior. This is more than a violation of site rules. This is a violation of an individual's personal safety. Something needs to be done to stop this.

Here\'s the subreddit stalking and harassing one individual person. \n\nThe subreddit /r/the_donald found a photo of a person and then stalked and harassed this person. This person was just a bystander who they targeted because they believed they have the appearance of transgender person and they think they are ""ugly"". This person may not even be transgender but /r/the_donald labelled this person as transgender as bigoted motivation to stalk and harass them. No one deserves this.\n\nThis has clearly escalated way out of control. The subreddit started a hate campaign against a random bystander and promoted finding this person and taking photos and videos of them. This is dangerous behavior. This is more than a violation of site rules. This is a violation of an individual\'s personal safety. Something needs to be done to stop this. \n\n\n*****\n\n\nDay #47\n[The fucking tranny skipped its daily estrogen injection. And it all hit it, uhh can I get my balls back.

2016-09-24 15:17:34,54aiyr,6,8,"So my kid doesn't like to make definitive statements or state anything. We have been doing our best with little guidance from our child.  

We know that this is on his/her (will not give any pronoun preference to us) mind through web searches done on my old laptop left in the dining room.   

We have helped with shopping in young men's for shirts, jeans, and underwear. We have ordered binders online. It isn't just a gender roles thing.  

I think that it is trying out various aspects and is part of self exploration and discovery.  

I try to reiterate that we are fine with whatever. Either gender. Neither gender. Bouncing about. But it feels like we need to do more.  

We do know that a childhood best friend (now a significant other) is FTM. We are pretty open. I grew up with someone who was transexual and had reassignment surgery (MTF). I have friends in many aspects of the LGBTQ continuum, but strangely not FTM. Her mother (not my wife) has a more diverse friend group than I do.  

That is a lot of detail. Most largely unimportant. Ugh. Sorry.  

So I am asking for any resources you could recommend. For any of us. Online as there isn't much in this area.  

Any recommendations on how to make this something we can talk about. Talking in the car so we aren't facing each other seems to help a bit. Reiterating love and acceptance seems to be something she appreciates, but doesn't change her desire to not talk.

Lastly, binders are expensive. Daaaaayuum. Any advice on what brands or retailers would be great. Any advice on other things that might increase comfort would be great. So far just shopping for clothes I would have bought 10-20 years ago seem to be very popular (as does the resulting layering).  

Sorry it is a bit uncoordinated. Not sure what to ask, but I could use some help. Trying to let her take her pace for the last few years has not been productive. The most progress has been when we just suggest things (How about we order a binder? Let's go look in the men's section for a bit. Etc.).

I'm afab (assigned female at birth) and nonbinary, and feminine presenting.  I dress ""like a girl""...  but I look, and have *always* looked, like a boy.  Or man now, I guess, since I'm 19 lol.

I am not a trans woman, and I am not amab despite having the experiences they do from being read this way.
