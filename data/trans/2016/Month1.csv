But I never felt like a ""man"". I liked letting others lead first in life, and then in the bedroom.

I started crossdressing, just to feel beautiful. I've never felt more like myself than in women's clothes. I feel comfortable and at ease. Like I was meant to be wearing them.

2016-01-10 16:59:18,40c1re,11,4,"Hey friends. Lately I've been having some really painful and scary feelings of needing to transition. I'm 21 years old and currently male. Sorry in advance if some details in this wall of text are TMI. I'm trying to just get everything out of my head and into this post. I'd really appreciate it if you have the time to read it and help me out with some wisdom. Theres a tl;dr at the end because this is a huge post.
Sorry for the throwaway account. I'm sure you can guess why.  

**The story so far:**  


The earliest I remember feeling like I was in the wrong body was when I was 5 years old. I was in preschool and I remember trying to convince another boy that I was secretly a girl. I cringe at this memory but I guess it's kind of sweet depending on how you look at it. I also have memories of trying to invert my genitals at a very young age (like, push it inside my body). I didn't know why at the time, but I knew I wanted it to go inwards and be flat on the outside. I also remember having to explain to my mother why I picked female characters in Mario Kart, and quickly coming up with the excuse of 'I pick all of them equally'. Even at that age, I knew this was something I had to lie about. Lying about this became a big theme in my life from this point forward.   


Between then and the age of 13 (or so), I didn't spend much time thinking about my gender at all. I wasn't really aware that transgender was a real thing. At this point I was very awkward and occasionally got teased at school, but for some reason my confidence was still relatively high and I remained a fairly talkative, happy child.   

When I was 14 (or around then) my family went on a short holiday. I had my own room with it's own bathroom, and one night I found myself, in my newfound privacy, looking in the mirror, fantasising about waking up female the next day. I repeated this each night, imagining myself slowly becoming more female in a number of different fantastical circumstances. The thought excited me in that special way that you can feel in your chest. This was when I started to think seriously about why I wanted to be a girl so badly.  

Age 15. My research led me to a number of online resources and armed with this knowledge, I ended up coming out to my mother, who cried and tried to tell me it was a phase. I don't hold it against her at all. She told my dad, who, in her words, 'tried to act like it never happened'. When the gender psychologist she took me to said it was time to start thinking about HRT, she cut all ties with him, and I stopped seeing him. My mother and I had a really awkward argument about it and since then the topic has barely been discussed at all. I spent the next few years in and out of awkward phases as a result of never feeling comfortable in my own skin.  

When I was 18, I got a girlfriend and stopped thinking about it for a while. I tried to convince myself I would be able to just live my life as a male. In my head, I had a choice between my career and creative ambitions (which I was heavily focusing on), and transitioning. I chose the former, because transitioning seemed almost impossible. When I was 19, the feelings of wanting to become a woman were intensifying, but I doubled down on trying to ignore them and live a fulfilling life as a male. At this point, I knew I was female in my head, but thought I'd be able to find happiness without transitioning. My relationship ended for unrelated reasons, and I met a new girl, who continues to light up my life almost 3 years later.  

I'm now 21 now, and over the past few years, I've been withdrawing more and more into my comfort zone. I'm experiencing social anxiety to a stronger extent than I can ever remember, despite being happy with my friendships and my relationship. This is leading me to spend extended periods alone, often engaging in escapism through tv shows and video games. I feel really depressed lately, and often struggle to see any goodness or positivity in life. Sometimes I get consumed by a feeling of hopelessness. And I've never needed to be female more. The feeling of excitement I get when I think about transitioning is overwhelming. A few nights a week, I lock myself in my room and dress in some skirts and dresses I bought online. I actually wore some make-up for the first time tonight and loved what I saw. It feels amazing, but its so crushing knowing I can't leave my bedroom in these clothes without being humiliated.   

I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world. She supports me through my moodiness and depression to a huge extent. She has no knowledge of my gender issues, and I feel like she'd have a hard time with me transitioning. If I'm being honest, I expect she'd have to break up with me, because she's not romantically attracted to girls. One night however, we were watching a TV show about transgender people in the UK, and out of nowhere, she joked that if I decided to become a woman she'd still love me. I can't tell how serious she was being, and I don't want to be too hopeful. I have a feeling the reality of transitioning would be way more dramatic than either of us could imagine. This is the number one thing which stops me from transitioning. Maybe we could still be best friends afterwards? I hate thinking about living my life without her.  

So here I am, 21 years old, wishing I were female on the outside more than ever. And yet, the thought of becoming a transgirl scares me more than anything. I honestly think I have a pretty good shot at passing, as I have a feminine face and a slim physique, but if I were to transition and not pass I don't think I'd be able to handle it. I suppose I just really really wish I could be female without having to go through transitioning. I'm terrified of the social repercussions, and at my prospects of having the career I want if I were to transition. I don't know how my family would react. I'm really scared. If I were confident I could transition successfully and pass I'd do it in a heartbeat, but I just feel petrified with fear and unable to act. And with every month that passes, I feel like my chances of becoming a feminine woman get lower and lower.  


**tl;dr:** I really want to transition but don't want to lose the girl I love and am terrified of the social repercussions of being trans. Passing is really important to me and I'm scared that I won't be satisfied with my femininity.

The feeling of excitement I get when I think about transitioning is overwhelming. A few nights a week, I lock myself in my room and dress in some skirts and dresses I bought online. I actually wore some make-up for the first time tonight and loved what I saw. It feels amazing, but its so crushing knowing I can't leave my bedroom in these clothes without being humiliated.   \n\nI love my girlfriend more than anything in the world. She supports me through my moodiness and depression to a huge extent. She has no knowledge of my gender issues, and I feel like she'd have a hard time with me transitioning. If I'm being honest, I expect she'd have to break up with me, because she's not romantically attracted to girls. One night however, we were watching a TV show about transgender people in the UK, and out of nowhere, she joked that if I decided to become a woman she'd still love me. I can't tell how serious she was being, and I don't want to be too hopeful. I have a feeling the reality of transitioning would be way more dramatic than either of us could imagine. This is the number one thing which stops me from transitioning. Maybe we could still be best friends afterwards? I hate thinking about living my life without her.  \n\nSo here I am, 21 years old, wishing I were female on the outside more than ever. And yet, the thought of becoming a transgirl scares me more than anything. I honestly think I have a pretty good shot at passing, as I have a feminine face and a slim physique, but if I were to transition and not pass I don't think I'd be able to handle it. I suppose I just really really wish I could be female without having to go through transitioning. I'm terrified of the social repercussions, and at my prospects of having the career I want if I were to transition. I don't know how my family would react. I'm really scared. If I were confident I could transition successfully and pass I'd do it in a heartbeat, but I just feel petrified with fear and unable to act. And with every month that passes, I feel like my chances of becoming a feminine woman get lower and lower.  \n\n\n**tl;dr:** I really want to transition but don't want to lose the girl I love and am terrified of the social repercussions of being trans. Passing is really important to me and I'm scared that I won't be satisfied with my femininity.   \n\nAny advice you have for me is much appreciated.

""Hi,

I was expecting this to happen at some point, but when it didn't for months I was, stupidly, optimistic. I thought maybe your service had loosened it's archaic naming rules, but alas, no. Let me clue you in here, though I am almost sure you know exactly what is happening. I am a trans woman. For the less educated among you, that means I do not identify as the gender assigned to me at birth, and identify as a woman. I actually used Facebook to announce this publicly, when I first decided to do so, on the 28th of June, 2015. I was impressed, then, at how simple it was to change your name and pronouns on Facebook, to those that you prefer. It was then, that I changed my name on Facebook from Jack James Harley, my birth name, to Jacqueline Jade Blackburn, my prefered name. That is the name I use in my everyday life and that is the only name I have had for 7 months. I find it amazing, then, to be contacted asking to prove my identity. Like there is some kind of fakery, or trickery, going on. As if I am somehow lying to the world. I not only find this abhorrent and rude, but would class it as downright discrimination. You say it is necessary, in order for people to connect with me on Facebook. I find this excuse ludicrous, for I have had no problem connecting with people on Facebook for the last 7 months, nor has anyone had problems connecting with me. From family I have not seen in years to people I barely meet at parties, connecting with people has been no more difficult now than ever. You are not asking me for identification to help people connect with me. You are asking for my identity as a personal attack upon my identity. That is how it feels, at the very least. 

""When we discover accounts that look fake or like they’re using fake information, we ask the owner to confirm they are who they say they are.""

I am very curious about this line specifically, taken from your ""Help Centre"" (very helpful). When you discover accounts that look fake, or like they are using fake information? How do you discover these accounts? What constitutes an account ""looking fake""? It all seems very suspicious to me. I believe that you reported my account because you know, as everyone does, that the name I use is not my legal name, and the gender I use is not my legal gender, yet. And so you feel you have the right to demand that I prove to you that I am who I say I am. Well guess what? You don't have that right. Legally, you might. But morally? You have no right to demand that of me, and you shall get no such pleasure from me. You want to deactivate my account because I am a trans young person, trying as we all are to fight so many barriers just to be ourselves? You go right ahead. If that's the kind of service you are providing then I don't want to be a part of it. But if you want to own up to your reputation as a progressive service, supportive of the LGBT community, then you will not only drop your case against me, but will end your repeated attacks upon trans people using your service.

We've helped each other grow, we've seen each other through struggle, we've shared moments of immense joy, and we've had what could be said to be a fairytale relationship for all of 4 years.

Except, I'm a woman. And she's not a lesbian. And there's nothing either of us can do about either of those things.

We've been long distance for our entire relationship (PA/CA) and only saw each other for a week or so at a time every few months. Still, the time we spent together was incomparable happiness, and even when apart we skyped almost every night for hours.

Last August, I came to terms with 10 years of feelings and began to seriously consider that I might be a woman. I told her that night, and I was met with a lot of discomfort. She supported me, but even though she was interested in women sexually, she was never interested in a relationship with one. She said if I transitioned, we probably wouldn't stay together. After a few hours of placating her and convincing her she was more important to me than that, she was okay.

I convinced her that I was genderfluid, that I still valued my male identity. Over the next few months, I experimented in my free time, dressing up, exploring my true self. I occasionally sent her pictures, and got sometimes enthusiastic responses. But I never knew how she would feel when I sent her something. She would sometimes get upset, and I would try to say that it would feel different in person.

Eventually I got my chance, when I spent 10 days with her the week of Thanksgiving. Towards the end of my trip, I dressed up with her one night. I wore my wig and a tshirt with a pair of leggings, and she did my makeup. I was happy. We were happy. We took pictures together. When I asked if it felt different in person, she said yes.

After I returned, I didn't dress up again for a while. I grew my beard out again so that nobody would be suspicious when I went home for my school's Christmas break. Over those 3 weeks, it killed me having to stay in my mom's one room apartment without being able to tell her. My girlfriend helped me deal with those feelings, and again everything seemed great. She was so supportive, and really helped me deal with what I was feeling.

After I came back to school, I shaved all my body hair, and bought a dress and heels. It made me feel so right. This past Sunday, I dressed up and sent her pictures again. Since then, she's been distant. Last night, when we skyped, I got the dreaded ""we need to talk."" We talked, and I finally fessed up. I'm a woman. It's plain as day. I can't do anything about that. After a lot of talking and a lot of crying, the 4 best years of my life ended, in the blink of an eye.

What hurts the most is that both of us still desperately want to be together. There's nothing I can do about how I feel, and there's nothing she can do about how she feels. It's nobody's fault. But it hurts. It hurts so much. I don't know if we'll ever stop loving each other, but it just can't go on.

I know this is best for me in the long term. My exploration of my identity now only has to make me happy and nobody else, and I know that's the only way I can truly be who I am. I just wish it didn't have to be this way.
