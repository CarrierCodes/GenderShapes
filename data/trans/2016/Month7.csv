The human in me loves everyone and respects the shit out of people for doing something about their gender dysphoria, but the scientist in me sees something wrong with our ideas about gender. 

So I think that gender should have everything to do with physical anatomy and that matters of the mind should be entirely left out of it. Keep in mind these are all thoughts from my own meditation and research. Why do we insist on maintaining the male/female duality after consistently acknowledging the transgender community? I was thinking ""What if we decided to have 4 genders instead?"" Standard male/female for those with both male/female primary/secondary characteristics. But also 2 other names for those who retain their natural primary sex organ and change their secondary sex characteristics. Personally I feel like male/female have a strong purpose anatomically, but not so much otherwise. Gender dysphoria is largely a product of environmental influence on a persons growth. I can understand sexuality being a spectrum as I personally believe everyone is inherently pansexual. But I have a hard time seeing gender as a spectrum as well, since I see the two as entirely separate. The former dealing with attraction and the latter dealing with physicality...

I know it's controversial, but I still feel like it could help with legal transitions for those who want to keep primary sex organs. 

What do y'all think? And if I'm entirely wrong... Could y'all help me understand gender as a spectrum?



Someone shared a video that helped explain the misstep in my logic.. I was thinking scientifically about the wrong word. Sex is the scientific word, not gender. Thanks!

Thus, I remain a straight male when what I would ideally identify as is a gay female.\n\nI am transgender but not in the current sense of the word. I am female. But...I am also male...I cant undergo a transition; I would rather stay the relatively attractive male I already am and feel a little out of place than start a process that would ultimately make me end up someone I dont want to be. So many people talk about a switch they would turn to switch genders. Thats me.\n\nIts impossible for me to truly be, inside and out, who I feel I am. Sometimes I get defensive when I feel like who I am is under the spotlight.

Because I am only 18, they are gate keeping me slightly by asking for a recommendation letter. I don't need the full official letter, just a short note from my therapist. If I had pushed back, I probably could have gotten by without it, but to win the game you have to play the game.

Total Price including blood work (no T test): $190
General appointment charge: $100
Required Bloodwork (pineal, estrogen, basic panel): $90
Optional Testosterone Test: $46

Recently, I set up an appointment for an informed consent preliminary appointment at Healthy Futures for Women in Denver, Colorado. I had an interesting experience there, and wanted to share what happened.

I called at the beginning of the week, and they gave me several options of when to have my appointment, 3 within the very same week. I chose one the following afternoon, wanting to expedite the process. The receptionist was very friendly when helping me schedule it, and even knew some trans terminology.

I was quite uncomfortable when I walked in, as the waiting room only had middle aged women sitting around, some with kids and some without, and I am 18 yrs amab pre-transition.

However, when I went up to the receptionist and told them my name and appt time, they were nice, and even asked if i had a preffered name (I'm sticking with my assigned name). I filled out paperwork for about 20 minutes, and the nurse came to get me about 5 minutes after I was done. I should also mention that appointment time includes check in, so you should expect to spend at least an hour and a half there if you are also doing blood work that day.

I was led to a private room, and the nurse took my vitals and asked me why I was there. When i mentioned HRT, she was surprised, but just kept asking me normal health questions. Weird reaction, but she turned out to be awesome.

Then Dr. Kate Weisenborn came in and asked me about my intent in starting HRT, and a bunch of doctor-y questions. When I told her how old I was, that created somewhat of an issue. she was immediately more guarded, and asked me if I was sure, and what I knew about HRT. I told her everything I knew, and about how much I wanted it, to finally stop the testosterone poisoning.

She left the room to print out the massive packet of medical information and all the consent forms. When she came back, she then asked me If I had been seeing a therapist about my gender. I told her yes, for a couple of months, but that he could't provide full recommendation letters, which is why I was going this route. Then, she told me that because I was so young, she was concerned about my decision, and wanted me to get a letter form the therapist. Not the full legal letter that's normally needed, but just a small note signed by him. Obviously, I was a mid upset, since isn't the point of informed consent NOT needing a letter? I could have pushed back, and i think she would agree if I had argued for it, but i was not it the mood, and I am pretty sure my therapist will be fine with it. She said that she would get the prescription ready, then as soon as they received the letter, they would send it to me. 

Then I got blood work done. It was a lot more expensive than I expected, and I needed to draw from savings, but I'm really glad that all I needed was the one appointment. 

Hopefully, I will have the prescription by the end of next week!

P.S. I know that the place is technically in Englewood, but it might as well be Denver.

Like I'm fairly newly coming out so a lot of the time people are saying ""I will try to use the right pronouns"" or ""It will take a while to get used to but I'll try"" which sounds reasonable enough right? itll take a while, youll slip up occasionally.

I've found that everyone I've said that's okay to though has just not tried at all. they havnt used the right name or pronouns a single time and in some cases its been nearly a year since I asked them to switch.

trouble is I know that if I respond by saying something like ""dont try just do"" or ""trying isnt good enough"" ill just seem really argumentative and they wont do it anyway. how can I approach this problem.

*""I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true,""*

So... This is it. I've finally made a Reddit post that will attempt to answer questions and possibly gain sympathy for feelings I don't even understand. How do I even start?

*""Wanted a woman, never bargained for you,""*

As I've read around on the sub, it seems that most people ""know"" from a young age that they are transgendered. Yet I don't believe I fall under that category. Sure, there were notably strange occurrences during my early childhood that somewhat tip me off - such as dreaming about waking up as a girl, or writing about switching genders - but I usually dismiss them as childish thoughts. Who knows, maybe I was curious about girls, or really into some ""Freaky Friday""-type scenarios. 

But I cannot stand the way I look. I claw at my fingernails, pick at my skin, desperate to be free of who I am supposed to be. I hate my body hair. I want to be able to wear my emotions on my sleeve without being insulted for being ""unmanly."" I can't help but imagine myself with a slender frame and feminine features. I wish to, instead of wearing baggy clothes to hide my appearance - wear frilly dresses and put on make-up and pretend to be someone else. No, I want to *be* someone else. If there were a switch, I would press it.

*""Lots of people talkin', few of them know,""*

I have told one person - who identifies as a genderfluid pansexual - very little of how I feel. Coming from a conservative background, it's hard for me to openly express my feelings where I cannot be overheard by those that may reprimand me. I am afraid to even open my mind anonymously.

At this one comedy event I participated in, they has us dress in ridiculous outfits for a skit-like performance. So I decided to dress in drag and use the most feminine accent I could muster up. I don't know how to describe it, but I felt... happy? pretty? like I really belonged? I don't know. It just felt like I was myself, but yet I wasn't.

*""Soul of a woman was created below...""*

I identify as a straight male when ideally I would identify as a gay woman. yet strangely, I am comfortable in my current state. I don't want to be someone else because then I would be out of place. I mean, how would I even go about explaining these feelings to my parents, or others around me? How do I make up my mind in the first place? How would I start a journey that I may not want to finish?
