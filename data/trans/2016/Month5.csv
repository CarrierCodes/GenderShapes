Posted this on my fb, as a cis childless female.  While these questions do not approach the debate in an effort to appeal to the inherent necessity of human rights of all people, (which should be all that should be needed) it is intended to debunk the most common arguments I see coming from these protesters (who appear to be ""traditional families"" and thats who i addressed it to.)  Could I get some feedback?

""Possible incendiary post alert.  Thanks for bearing with the long post.  Lets keep it civil ya'll.  Couple of questions about bathrooms being non-gendered.  

1)  As a mother generally unable to accompany your son (or more rigidly a father unable to accompany your daughter) into a public gendered bathroom, do you fear for their safety? And have you considered the ability to accompany both your daughters and sons (as is possible without gender segregation?) I ask because I have seen many a parent of both sexes nervously standing outside because of the social taboo of accompanying their child in a bathroom of the opposite sex.  I would think that the danger of an unaccompanied child makes a parent nervous, no matter the picture on the door.  A male predator in search of a female target would not lie in wait in the men's room, and vice versa for a male target.  (This applies to female predators too, but they do not seem to concern the general population as much.)

2)  As for possible adult victims, I posit a similar question.  Do you not feel safer entering a restroom in a group?  A male predator looking for a lone female would not hide in the mens room, but would hide in the womens room to wait for her (same for the opposite situation, and vice versa for same sex attacks.)  So if a male and female (couple, friends, etc) had the ability to use the same restroom, would this not enable the possibility of a safer environment from predators?

3)  If you have ever been in a non gendered personal environment (examples: festival showers, or ladies using the guys restroom while guys are there just because of an insane line, etc,) has that felt more or less safe than using a deserted facility that is (for lack of a better term) creepy?  

4)  Do you believe that the non gendering of bathrooms is vastly more likely to encourage predators, or do you think someone who plans to assault someone may not care about a bathroom policy since they are willing to assault another human?

5)  Do you believe that transgender people are more likely to commit assault? What do you believe differentiates this from the thought process that led to race segregated bathrooms, for fear that a black person was more likely to assault a white person?

I believe that having friends, family, or simply more people around is more likely to discourage assault than keeping the ""potential victims"" in an isolated environment where a predator knows they have no ""guardians.""  I personally feel safety in numbers, something present when girls go to a sketchy bathroom together but not possible when out with a male companion.  I believe families want to be able to watch over their offspring if they use a public restroom. I believe that the separation of the ""potential victims"" (women) from ""probable predators"" (men) perpetuates a dangerous rape culture.  I have used the mens room when the line was too long, and showered without fear among a room of all genders.  But thats me.  Tell me your thoughts.

I am also confused where the line would be drawn, and how it is to be enforced.  What of those born with traits of both genders? What of those that have had sex changes? Does a woman with masculine dress, features, appearance have to present her ""attributes"" to gain admission to the ladies room?  

On the other hand, I don't care for my SO to overhear me birth a Chipotle baby, nor do men want to wait in line like girls have to.  So there's that.  Now go forth and fight, hordes of the web. Because we are internet, we are angry.""

1) She wants to be able to go into the bathroom without the threat of someone looking in on her in the stall. 
2) She's okay with someone that was born intersex choosing whichever gender they feel like, but if they were born with a penis, they're a man and so they can't change genders, even with operations and vice versa.

You are posting falsehoods. Women and girls have experienced plenty of predatory behavior from cross-dressing and transgender males. In fact, they rape, beat and kill women at EXACTLY the same rates as non-transgender males. The problem is MALES being given the keys to LEGALLY enter women's and girls' safe spaces. They're bigger, stronger, more likely to sexually assault (98% of rapists are male) and transwomen are no different than other males in this regard. Women and girls DO NOT want naked male bodies in our showers, locker rooms, bathrooms, dressing rooms. If we didn't have a natural modesty and need female-only privacy in these intimate situations (e.g. changing into our bathing suits), we'd just rip off our clothes in the halls or next to the pool and flash the world. But we don't because we want privacy from the too-often predatory male gaze of strangers and we do NOT want to see his parts, either (thanks but no thanks, flashers!) Why have dressing rooms for women at all if you're going to introduce strange males into the rooms? Google: Paul ""Pauline"" Witherspoon Dallas Texas, Michelle Kosilek, Thomas Lee Benson Milwaukie Oregon; Colleen Francis Evergreen State College, Christopher ""Jessica"" Hambrook Toronto - there are many cases of male transwomen and cross-dressers sexually assaulting, flashing, even killing women. Please stop posting lies that hurt females.

Susan, thank you for comments

What statement(s) is(are) falsehoods?

The data I provided is from the federal government. The claim by Dr. Jacobs was disproven via the letter from the Montgomery County Police Chief.

I've never been in a dressing room, whether it is at Nordstrom Rack, Kohls, Target, Macy's etc, where I'm changing in from of all other patrons using the room. They are locked enclosures with mirrors. 

As far as the items you ask to Google, 

If you are suggesting these are examples of how a law providing a transgender person full and proper access to all of the fruits of life ensured by all citizens of the country, then I sorry to inform you they do not.

Michelle Kosilek was married to Cheryl McCaul. Ms. McCaul was NOT murdered in a public changing room, a locker room, or a restroom nor as a result of a ""man"" gaining access to such a space because a law like this was on the books because no such laws existed in that jurisdiction when that crime was committed. Massachusetts added their law in 2011, 21 years after this murder, and it does NOT include public accommodations. Ms Kosilek transitioned AFTER convicted of her crime.

Thomas Lee Benson Milwaukie Oregon is a convicted sex offender with a record going back 17+ years. It is unlawful for him to go anywhere children are congregating, regardless of what he is wearing. ""Clackamas County Circuit Judge Steven L. Maurer found Benson guilty of second-degree criminal trespass, unlawful entry into a motor vehicle and frequenting a place where children regularly congregate, which is a crime for predatory sex offenders."" As with this law in Maryland, illegal acts remain illegal. In Oregon, laws are on the books to prevent discrimination for transgender people, and they too do not negate illegal activities such as those committed by Thomas Lee Benson.

Paul ""Pauline"" Witherspoon Dallas Texas, there is ""nothing"" Not sure what you wanted to highlight, other than a tertiary source at best just repeating the same jumbled mess of words you are.

Now, to Christopher Hambrook from Toronto. The ONLY information about this individual comes nearly two years AFTER these attacks occurred. 

The Toronto Sun writes :
""Shortly after his mother died in Montreal in February 2002, Hambrook committed the first of his sex crimes by sexually assaulted a family friend’s five-year-old daughter. While on bail waiting for courts to deal with charges laid for that crime, he targeted a 27-year-old mentally challenged woman, by sexually assaulting her in his home and forcing her to smoke a joint.

Hambrook received two years in jail for each of those crimes, for a total of four years.

“He had no empathy, no remorse or understanding of his victims of his offences,” Toronto psychiatrist Dr. Treena Wilkie said in her assessment.""

This is a delusional and psychiatrically disturbed individual who clearly cannot obey any law. The presence of lack of presence of trans rights laws, did not, nor will not ever stop him as witnessed by the psychiatric testimony offered by professionals.

I'm a bisexual white cisgendered guy, part of the LGBT umbrella. I feel like at least in some small way, we're all on the same team fighting for acceptance in a world that in many ways (some more than others) we don't feel like we fit into. A close friend of mine, someone I grew up with since middle school, is a trans girl and the strength of our friendship or my acceptance of them has never wavered. While I might not know firsthand, I've heard secondhand stories of your stuggles and I can't imagine suffering the way some of you (including my friend) have; I'm lucky enough to have a family that's very understanding of my bisexuality despite some of them being incredibly religious and conservative.

But I have a big thing I struggle with. My experiences with the trans community on the whole (being mostly Reddit but a few friends-of-friends that I've met) have been very negative. I've been verbally attacked because I'm a cis guy; I've had multiple debates (hell, one of them tonight, which led to this post!) where I've been dismissed and told 'cishet' is not an insult. I've been in conversations where I was specifically trying to agree with and defend the trans community and I get snapped at for pronoun slips (which I apologize for, not that it does any good) as if I'm deliberately taking stabs. I feel like in literally every time I've tried to take a stand and do right by the trans community, I've been insulted for doing so. 

It makes every time I speak up harder than the last. I don't want to become apathetic to the struggles of a very marginalized group of people. The surest way for evil to prosper is for good people to do nothing, and marginalized groups need the majority on their side if persecution is going to end.

I'm a cis woman, in a relationship for the past year with my transfemme genderqueer partner. They came out as trans not long before we got together (we had already been friends for a few years), and has since been presenting very femme.

 A few months ago they decided to start hormones - but given the rubbish state of gender clinics here they got some estrogen from an older trans lady friend of ours (who is a general badass and kind of guide for younger trans folks in our scene) and more was to be procured online, along with anti-androgens, as a more steady supply and a higher dose. After just over 2 months on hormones (which they were feeling great about!) they ran out and customs issues have delayed more... It's now been almost a month since they've taken estrogen, and they're feeling shit about it. I know they'd been excited for the weather getting better and feeling more like dressing cute and stuff as their body changed, and they feel like that isn't going to happen, that they're backsliding and it'll soon be as if they never started at all. Coupled with their existing depression, and issues with their parents being unaccepting, this has had a bad effect on their mental health.

It was a rare sunny day today, and I woke and got up to find our housemates all in the mood to sit in our garden drinking tea. Knowing my partners insomnia and depression means sometimes they'll sleep through a fun buzz and feel shit about it later, I popped in to them in our room to see if they wanted to join us - bad call - I hadn't realised that they've actually gotten so low that they didn't want to be woken or awake (or alive really,tbh :( ) at all and have since been sitting in bed feeling like crap. I felt terrible about having woken them - and about how low they are generally.

As I said, it's warm, so I've been in shorts and a bikini top hanging about and doing things around the house, and have been also in and out to hang with them and see how they are doing.

I was making some food in the kitchen when I got a Facebook message from them - asking if I could wear something other than my bikini around them today as it was making them feel jealous and shit about their body. I said ok, and am now wearing a tshirt.

....but I am feeling *really* uneasy about the whole thing. I'm not going to raise it with my partner now - they're feeling so horrid and I don't want to add to that - people also don't tend to be their best most receptive selves when super duper low, so I don't think it would be productive from an ""us vs the problem"" standpoint anyway. I'm also not sure if this even is the problem I feel it might be - I'm hoping for some clarity here.

I wanted to field some thoughts from trans folks, particularly transfemme folks, about the whole thing, and gather my thoughts. The thought that me being around my partner dressed in very little makes them feel horrible about their own (beautiful!) body breaks my heart - and the idea of them having to sit there feeling that way if they want my company when they're down is an awful one.... But like I said, it feels weird, and wrong. I'm well aware that it isn't *at alllll* coming from the same place as the impetus on women to cover because of the lustful gaze of men - but feeling like I should be covering my body because of anybody else's reaction to it, whatever it may be and wherever it may come from, is a profoundly discomfiting one.

I'm trying really hard to be understanding. I'm totally open to the possibility that there's an element to this that I'm currently not seeing because I'm cis and my relationship to my gender and body is so different from theirs in this world, or because of my own emotional reaction to the idea of changing what I wear to suit somebody else(which I've only ever before encountered in the other form, the 'don't be slutty' 'cover your shame' form, so have a knee jerk defence reaction to)

2016-05-29 18:54:46,4llos1,4,11,"I posted this on the ftm subreddit too but I thought I'd post here too.

This has been bothering me since October, when I came out to my dad's side of the family. My dad, bless him, has done his research and tries to call me by my name, but fails miserably in real life. The problem here is my grandparents. They pretty much raised me, I lived with them ages 3/4 - 10-ish, and after that I sort of became distant and it hurt them a lot. I didn't mean to, but it was because of their attitude towards everything. They're racist, homophobic and the worst bit, transphobic. When my grandmother was told I was trans she said I was having a sex change (as if it's one simple little snip) and that top surgery was mutilation (when that's the thing I want so badly) and it hit really hard. Obviously, they're old, in their 70's now. They have old fashioned values. They're from a dodgy bit of London and they don't like anything out of the ordinary. Okay, I've rambled enough about the background situation. The main problem is, my grandmother has pretty recently been diagnosed with dementia, and forgets things. She has forgotten I am trans, and my family won't help me to tell her. My dad got angry when I told him that her constant use of female pronouns, my old name, anything feminine towards me was hurting me so badly. He said if I dare blame her, he's going to get angrier. I live fully as male, my mum's side (parents are divorced and don't talk) all call me by my right name and pronouns and have been absolutely fantastic. I'm out at school and all my friends know me as male. I'm male in every situation but that phone call I am forced to do every week, where I am violently gendered and it hits me so hard. I don't know if I can do it anymore, but I know if I continue to not talk to them, my dad will get angry. Has anyone got any advice?

TL;DR: My grandparents are sort of unsupportive, grandmother has dementia, forced to talk to them and be violently gendered every time when I am male everywhere else. I can't handle it, and need help.
