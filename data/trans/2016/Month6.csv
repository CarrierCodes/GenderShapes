I can help you to feminize your voice.
I have already posted in this sub previously, but I figured there might be more people willing to have lessons that don't know about me.

- I am using my own methodology which is based on approach that is personal. 
  It means that I do not stick to one method with everybody, but rather try to figure out what works for you personally.

- I am sure that anybody can feminize their voice.
  Depending on skill and diligence the process can take from a couple of months to a year.

- And it is affordable.
  Any other voice feminization tutor will charge you at least twice as much. And will keep you paying for as long as he can.

I ask for 15$ per lesson. One lesson lasts for 45 minutes. The best schedule is three lessons per week, but we can arrange any routine that suits you best.

First lesson is free and you pay only after the lessons.

I am available from 8am till 8pm UTC+0.

2016-06-05 01:54:47,4mlegq,9,11,"Sorry for the giant wall of text.

So I'm an 18 year old male, and I've been thinking for a few months now that I may be trans. I say ""may"" because I'm still very unsure and conflicted over whether or not I truly am. 

I've always been a very solitary guy and I've struggled with social anxiety for a long time, but only recently have I started to think that this might be caused by gender dysphoria. For a very long time I've been uncomfortable and somewhat embarassed with the way my body looks, even though I know from an objective standpoint I'm not unattractive. I know a lot of people, even attractive people, are unsatisfied with their bodies look, but really I don't even think making myself look more attractive by masculine standards would make me feel any better. When I picture myself more muscular or whatever it doesn't really make me feel any better or encourage me, but when I picture myself as a woman I find it somewhat comforting.

The big reason that I doubt that I'm transgenered is that I don't think I've ever been able to point to any experience and definitively say ""that was gender dysphoria."" I can't remember having any particular childhood memories where I felt compelled towards more feminine things (which seems to be a very common occurence for trans people from what I've read), and there's never really been a particular moment in my life where I've said to myself ""I wish I was a woman."" I've read [That Was Dysphoria?](http://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) and I can relate to a lot of the symptoms described there, but of course those symptoms don't necessarily imply gender dysphoria and could easily be explained by plenty of other mental issues.

I recently ""came out"" to my girlfriend and told her about all of these thoughts. She was fantastically awesome about it and without any hesitation let me know that she was completely okay with it and would support me no matter what decision I eventually came to. It was extremely comforting to get this off of my chest, but more than just being comforting it just feels a lot less stressful to be around her in general since I told her. I've always gotten stressed out when being around people for too long, and while I know that's a very normal thing and I don't want to make myself out to sound like a special-snowflake type, since telling her I haven't really felt like I have to worry about acting masculine and it's been so much easier to talk to her honestly and without being stressed.

Again, I know getting stressed out around people is a normal thing, but at the risk of sounding self-important, I feel like the stress I get from being around people is more than just introversion. For my entire life I've felt like I was lying to everyone I interacted with, even my best friends and family, although I've never been able pinpoint exactly *what* I was lying about. I've often felt like I don't even really have a personality, I just mirror whatever the people around me are doing. I know that almost everyone acts differently around different people, but for me I've never even felt like I'm acting differently from my ""true self"" or whatever, but that I don't even have a true self to begin with. Only since I opened up to my girlfriend have I really felt that I'm not lying to anyone or pretending to be something that I'm not. I don't know if this is a result of telling her that I might be trans, or just generally being more honest to her about my emotions.

My girlfriend has been so supportive that she has even helped me try crossdressing a few times to see how it feels. She showed me how to put on makeup, let me try on some of her clothes, and even borrowed a wig from a friend to let me try it on. With all of it on I really did feel comfortable and calm, and for the first time I can remember I felt truly content with the way I looked (despite the fact that I looked far from perfect).

Now to get to the weird psychoanalytical side of the problem; I've been struggling with whether or not I'm trans for months now and I keep jumping back between thinking ""I'm definitely not trans and it's silly to even think that I am, I just have social anxiety or something,"" and ""I'm definitely trans and I need to stop denying it."" Based on this I think there are basically two possibilities to explain the way I'm feeling:

* I'm cis and I'm just using the idea of being transgender as an excuse to have hope because I want to believe that there is a solution to the anxiety and stress that I feel constantly
* I'm trans and I'm only denying it because I'm afraid of transitioning and don't want to ruin my relationships with everyone in my family and friends

I'm not really sure how to figure out which one of these is true. I've done a bunch of research and the question of ""Am I trans?"" seems to be met by something like [this](http://amitransgender.com/) most of the time, but I can't just accept it that easily. I'm also fully expecting that the response to this thread will probably be ""Go see a therapist,"" but unfortunately due to the fact that I'm living under my parent's medical insurance that would require letting my parents know about all of this, which I'm not ready to do just yet. I understand that seeing a therapist is unavoidably the eventual outcome of this situation but I figured it might be worth posting this here, even if just to collect my own thoughts.

2016-06-08 15:22:34,4n5k3b,13,57,"As a preface - I know a lot of trans people take the ""Don't ask me personal questions; they're none of your business"" approach with people.  I've always taken the ""I'll answer anything you want to know; I don't really care if it's personal"" approach, and give them a ""btw - Many trans people would get offended at the personal nature of these questions, so I would not suggest asking others.  The answers will vary from person to person, but so will that person's willingness to answer.""

So I was talking to someone yesterday about ""how sex works when you're trans and have the wrong parts"", and I came up with a pretty decent analogy for explaining to them the dysphoria I can experience during sex.

I was talking about how I don't MIND physical or oral contact with my genitals, but I can't watch.  It feels fine, but I close my eyes or look away, and just sorta mentally try to blank out ""what's happening"" and just enjoy ""how it feels"", disassociated from the act.  As a cis guy, he couldn't wrap his mind around this; like - if it feels good, why would I be averse to looking?  Isn't watching part of the pleasure?

So I asked him if he was straight; he is.  Like, 100%.  I asked him, ""If you used a glory hole, it would feel good, right?""

Him: ""Yeah""

Me: ""Okay, so what if you had a guy going down on you, would you like that?""

Him: ""No!""

Me: ""So it's the same act, the same physical feeling, but the mental feeling, how you respond and react - it changes.  It would be fine if you didn't know where it was coming from, like with a glory hole, and your mind just sorta assumes it's a woman on the other end.  But when you see that that's not what's ACTUALLY happening, it makes you uncomfortable.""

2016-06-08 18:18:02,4n6hhl,2,3,"Cis guy here with a question I've been thinking about a lot lately.

I work in the medical field and many of my patients are trans. It can be tricky because for insurance purposes, we need to use a patient's legal name and gender in their medical chart - otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues with billing, transfer of records and so on. My practice does a great job noting a patient's preferred name and pronouns on the chart, so despite the ""legal"" name and gender often being inaccurate to the patient's preference, we still have no trouble making sure we address the patient by their correct name and pronouns internally.

Where things can get tricky is if I'm sending documentation to another office. I think the easiest way to demonstrate what I'm talking about is with a hypothetical case.

Let's say my patient Rose Smith is a transwoman whose legal name is John Smith (she hasn't gone through the process of changing her legal name and gender yet). She has a thyroid issue so we are referring her to an endocrinologist at a local hospital. She is aware we are referring her and she is fine with the endocrinologist knowing she is trans.

The endocrinologist will have to register Rose under her legal name and gender for the reasons I mentioned before (billing, etc), and since Rose has already scheduled her appointment this has already been done. In the endocrinologist's medical records, she is listed as ""John Smith.""

I now need to fax medical records over to the endocrinologist so he is up to date on her case. The printouts from the computer all list her name as ""John Smith,"" again for billing purposes we unfortunately have to use the legal name.

I want to indicate on the fax that these records are for a patient who in their system will be named ""John Smith,"" but is actually Rose Smith. What is the best way to write the patient's name on the records to indicate this?

One of my coworkers typically writes something like ""John 'Rose' Smith,"" but I feel like putting the patient's preferred name in quotation marks implies that it isn't her ""real"" name.

I personally have been writing it as ""Rose (John) Smith,"" which I think gives the patient's preferred name its proper place while also indicating the legal name to avoid any confusion or errors.

I'm aware there are probably a lot of different opinions on this but I would love to hear from some trans folks on how they'd like this to be handled. These are documents that the patient is likely never going to see, but they can have a big effect on how the patient is addressed when care is being transferred from one office to another.

I am a straight 16 year old gal with plenty of issues, *PLENTY*. However, two of these issues, in particular, have been weighing on me for quite some time now.Yes, I am talking about my jugs.

Ever since these blasted fat sacks sprouted from my formerly flat chest way back in the seventh grade, I have been experiencing extreme self consciousness. Which, trust me, did not help with the already existing awkwardness of puberty. Part of this discomfort is from a physical standpoint, (Sports are hard when you're carrying jiggly-ass grapefruits on your body), but most of it comes from deep down inside. I absolutely hate having boobs, I hate the feeling of being sexualized by my breasts, and I hate not being able to dress in a way that empowers me.

Now, I haven't really wanted to do anything about these odd feelings until recently when my well-meaning mother brought home a pair of target pushup bras and forced me to wear them. These damned things felt so uncomfortable and disgusting, especially in comparison to my normal sports bra. My mom proceeded to set me down and tell my that I had to start wearing ""real bras"" and that I had uni-boob. She told me to be proud of having boobs. This brutal honesty shocked me and brought much more of my attention to my body.

To cover up, I began wearing tight fitting camisoles, over my bra, to hold my breasts in place. Then, I would pick out the baggiest tee that I could find and slouch the rest of the day.

To this day, I hate my clothes, my body, and my outward appearance. I am sick and tired of feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin, and I am desperately wishing for a day when I can rock my favorite androgynous outfits without my damn boobs getting in the way. I long to move and dress in a way that makes me happy. I want to be free.

If any of you amazing reddit users has advice for me,  I would very much appreciate it.

I know that there are studies about this, and that trans people's brains are the same as the gender that identify as. 

If I can show him a valid scientific study. (not some article.) he will change his view. 

I tried googling but can't find one, only articles that talk about studies. 

Does anyone have one of these studies?

I've just been to the GP in my city and spoke to them about referring me to a Gender Identity Clinic. He was helpful and understanding and it feels like my first step to being happy. 

I feel so scared though. I've spoken a lot in the past couple of days with my girlfriend of a year and 9 months and whilst she is incredibly supportive and understanding she isn't sure she'd find me attractive if I changed, which I completely understand. It kills me that I might lose her because of what I feel I need to do to be happy, like if these feelings in my mind didn't exist then we'd just be happy and I could be the best boyfriend she'd ever have. 

We've also spoken about society, and how I'll no longer be considered 'normal' in the world anymore, and furthermore that if she stays with me that she'd also not be considered 'normal' because of it. It's just terrifying and it makes me hate that I'm doing this because of some stupid thoughts in my head. I just want to be happy with how I want to act, dress, speak, live. 

I feel like my family will be understanding, but it will still be difficult. 

If it was down to me I'd change in a heartbeat. But it feels like there is so much relying on me being who I am that it gets me so close to just saying fuck it I'll be miserable for the rest of my life. 

Sorry, there's so much going on in my head that I just can't even put it in to words. I just have to get it all out. I don't even think this is everything. 

Thanks.

I've told my mother I'm trans, but not him yet, because of course he's also an HB2 supporter. He understands gender so rigidly that last time I had dinner with my parents, I counted four times in an hour he declared something arbitrarily (such as ordering steak vs. seafood, or margarita vs. beer) as ""wot men do or do not.""

So yeah, haven't told him yet.

After Pulse, I realized I had to tell him I was trans regardless of the personal consequences. My mother was stressing this need relentlessly just so she wouldn't have to be my secret-keeper, yet when I decided to tell him, she flipped out because she was out of town and wanted to be there for him (would it really be that traumatic for *him*?) I'd already sent him a text saying that I needed to tell him something, but I recanted at her insistence. I told him I'd talk about it when she gets back.

Instead, I messaged one of my sisters. I could've handled this better, but I asked her what everyone in the family (except my father, of course) already knew: ""Are you a lesbian?"" She said yes, and I came out to her. I probably shouldn't have asked this, but I asked if she could stand with me on this one. She declined, and I don't blame her. It's a lot safer and easier for her, you know?

Probably because my eldest sister (a hardcore Roman Catholic) was nothing but supportive (of me at least, she was annoyed at my middle sister for not telling *her* this sooner).

So now my two sisters (I guess we're three sisters now? That's weird to think of) are coming to visit at the end of July. My middle sister is going to come out with me, and my eldest is going to stand in support of us.
