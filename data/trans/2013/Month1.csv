2013-01-13 21:32:49,16ieht,5,18,"So I've been working at my job to save for surgery. Last November my job sent out an e-mail stating that they were adding  new benefits to my insurance package, SRS surgery is one of them. This has bumped my time-table from about 3 years till I get surgery to a year or less.

I've been starting the process. I've contacted the surgeon (Marci Bowers is in my network!) and I'm working through all the paperwork and I should have a date scheduled by February at the rate I'm going. Doc Bowers schedules appointments a year out but I was told by the receptionist that I could see her within 3-6 months with cancellations.

Sorry, blabbering!

Anyways, I'm looking for advise and tips on what to expect during and after the surgery as well as anything I can do to help recover or stave off boredom. I already know that I'm going to be in the hospital for 12 days and that I need some recovery time after. 

1) How long do you think I'll be sitting around before I can move around freely? I exercise and bicycle a lot, how long do I have to wait before getting back on the saddle? 

2) I'm a foodie, how long after surgery can I eat? I ask because I remember hearing that my lower-half will be bandaged up so I imagine I wont be able to eat/use the bathroom for awhile

3) Should I change my diet or be aware of medication changes?

4) What do you suggest I do to keep the boredom of recovery away?

2013-01-20 23:59:22,16ygfx,9,7,"Hey Reddit. Today, January 20th, marks my first year on testosterone. Today, I just wanted to share my story in hopes that it will help any of you get started on transitioning, or maybe give you some inspiration to keep transitioning, even if you don’t see the progress right away.


I first discovered that I had GID through my girlfriend (heterosexual female), after I confessed that I really liked her. Her initial response was that she couldn’t be with a lesbian, but after I told her that I felt more like a guy and that I didn’t consider myself gay, she started doing some research (having heard of GID on a television show a while back) and began sending me articles of the disorder. Reading those symptoms felt like reading out of a diary. It was a very conflicting moment in my life, because I was relieved that I knew what was “wrong” with me, but at the same time, I knew that I was going to start a very long journey to transition.
I’m 20 years old now, but I discovered this around the fall of 2007. At that time, and some time before that, I was seeing an endocrinologist for polycystic ovarian syndrome. They put me on birth control to fix my estrogen levels, but when I realized it was doing the opposite of what I wanted, I quit going there. I had just started high school and had no idea where to turn with this information. My step-father was in the military at the time, so we have military insurance(known for not being LGBT friendly). Our hospital was on a military base, so the awkwardness of going to the doctors while looking like a different gender was multiplied by the fact that it was a military hospital. 

The first person I told, my girlfriend aside, was my mother. My mom and I have always had a good relationship, and she has always been extremely supportive of me. She always assumed that I would be gay, because she noticed how tomboyish I was from an early age (didn’t like dolls, didn’t like girly clothes, and didn’t like long hair). She was very supportive and wanted to make sure that I knew what this entailed for me, and she also wanted me to know that even though she would support me, she and my step-father would be unable to do so financially in the long-run. 

I bided my time through highschool, unsure of exactly how to go about getting testosterone injections. I knew that in order to have surgery I needed to be diagnosed by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, so I told my mother that I wanted counseling. I was pretty depressed in middle school, and was getting extremely stressed out by trying to figure out what to do. I got permission to see a psychiatrist from my insurance, and when I explained everything to her, she told me that although she was very convinced that I had GID, we couldn’t put that down as the main reason for me seeing her, because my insurance didn’t cover it. We had to put depression. I stopped seeing her after a few months.

Time passed, I watched youtube videos and read a lot of forums on surgery types, costs, and different methods of hormonal treatment. As someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my testosterone levels were already higher than normal, so I had more facial/body hair, and my voice was slightly lower than most girls. I passed pretty well as a male just from face-to-face interaction, but my voice and breasts were what really gave me away. My sophomore year, I started wearing a binder. It wasn’t the best, as I have really large breasts (thanks mom) but it was better than the sports bras I was wearing. I figured that my name change was what I needed to do next. This was difficult because I was born in Germany, on an American base, and any change to my birth certificate would have to be done through an American Consulate. 

My senior year, I shortened my name from “Brittany” to “Brit.” I told some of my closer friends what I intended to do, but I knew that even after changing my name and starting to transition, it would be difficult because I was going to go to college in the same town that I graduated, which many of my classmates did as well. The end of senior year was tough, because they separated gown colors by gender, and females were required to wear a dress or skirt underneath their gown. I spoke to a very nice vice-principal privately and told her about my disorder, but our principal wouldn’t allow me to wear male colors and sit with the guys. I would, however, be allowed to wear shorts under my gown, and my name would be announced as “Brit _____,” and not my girly full first and middle name. 

Immediately following my graduation (June of 2011) I started my name change. I found a local attorney and I dropped $600 to have my name legally changed. I then had to deal with the long wait of processing through the American consulate after sending them documents mid-July of 2011. I had to return my birth certificate (which was a replacement of my original certificate that had been lost during my parents’ divorce), send in the legal name change papers, and pay $50 dollars to have a new one made. After two months of waiting, I was informed I would need a signed document from a notary verifying that it was a replacement birth certificate. 

I included a request to have my gender marker changed, and explained my situation. I was emailed and informed that in order to have the gender marker changed, I would need “a notarized physician’s letter that documents subject’s sexual reconstructive surgery that includes the following:
&gt; * Medial license or certificate number

&gt; * Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate

&gt; * Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to physician

&gt; * Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct. 

I was happy to learn exactly what I would need to do so in the future. I received this letter at the end of October, and it was already halfway through my first college semester. My name was still Brittany. I went and spoke directly to an executive in admissions at my college, and explained the situation. I told her that I really wanted my name changed because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would take before I received the paperwork, and that I felt uncomfortable with my name in my classes. She was very nice about and said she would see what she could do. She ended up changing my name in the system, and said that I would need to turn in the necessary documents as soon as possible (i.e., new driver’s license, new social security card, and new birth certificate). 

December rolled around and I finally got the paperwork from the American Consulate. Changing my drivers license was very easy, but I was nervous because I had heard that a lot of trans get flak from people at the DMV. I thought I would need my new birth certificate, but I found out that all I really needed was my legal name change documents (so I could have had my driver’s license changed since the summer… *facepalm*). Next was the social security office, and they asked for the legal name change paperwork, my new birth certificate, and my ID. That also went over very smoothly.

At the end of December, I decided to go and see my old Endocrinologist to see if there was anything they could do for me. I spoke to my doctor, told him that I have GID and that I wanted to start hormonal therapy, and if he knew of any place that I could go to because my insurance wouldn’t pay for it. My doctor said that they could take care of me, and that he actually had a few other patients who were trans that were being treated there. I was so relieved, and made an appointment for blood work, and then an injection. 

Although I pay out of pockets, my injections are kept off of the record from my insurance company and I have a $12 copay to have actual doctor visits. My injections are $39 per injection, but most of the price is a fee to have a nurse administer the injection (required by my Endocrinologist because of their company policy, it may be different for you). I get these twice a month and see my Endocrinologist once every 3-4 months.

My first injection was January 20th, 2012. Already having more testosterone than normal because of my POS, most of my changes happened quickly—within the first 3-5 months of being on testosterone. Some of the good things: my voice deepened pretty quickly, I noticed a steep increase in facial and body hair, and there’s definitely been an increase in libido, although I already had a pretty active sex drive before T. Some of the bad things: my acne got worse (again), and I get a lot more irritable and angry around injection time. 

Here’s a sample of how much my voice has changed (Sorry for the quality of the first one):

Here’s an example of my facial hair. I trimmed recently, so it usually looks fuller than this.

Today, January 20th, marks my first year on testosterone. Today, I just wanted to share my story in hopes that it will help any of you get started on transitioning, or maybe give you some inspiration to keep transitioning, even if you don’t see the progress right away.\n\n\nI first discovered that I had GID through my girlfriend (heterosexual female), after I confessed that I really liked her. Her initial response was that she couldn’t be with a lesbian, but after I told her that I felt more like a guy and that I didn’t consider myself gay, she started doing some research (having heard of GID on a television show a while back) and began sending me articles of the disorder. Reading those symptoms felt like reading out of a diary. It was a very conflicting moment in my life, because I was relieved that I knew what was “wrong” with me, but at the same time, I knew that I was going to start a very long journey to transition.\nI’m 20 years old now, but I discovered this around the fall of 2007. At that time, and some time before that, I was seeing an endocrinologist for polycystic ovarian syndrome. They put me on birth control to fix my estrogen levels, but when I realized it was doing the opposite of what I wanted, I quit going there. I had just started high school and had no idea where to turn with this information. My step-father was in the military at the time, so we have military insurance(known for not being LGBT friendly). Our hospital was on a military base, so the awkwardness of going to the doctors while looking like a different gender was multiplied by the fact that it was a military hospital. \n\nThe first person I told, my girlfriend aside, was my mother. My mom and I have always had a good relationship, and she has always been extremely supportive of me. She always assumed that I would be gay, because she noticed how tomboyish I was from an early age (didn’t like dolls, didn’t like girly clothes, and didn’t like long hair). She was very supportive and wanted to make sure that I knew what this entailed for me, and she also wanted me to know that even though she would support me, she and my step-father would be unable to do so financially in the long-run. \n\nI bided my time through highschool, unsure of exactly how to go about getting testosterone injections. I knew that in order to have surgery I needed to be diagnosed by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, so I told my mother that I wanted counseling. I was pretty depressed in middle school, and was getting extremely stressed out by trying to figure out what to do. I got permission to see a psychiatrist from my insurance, and when I explained everything to her, she told me that although she was very convinced that I had GID, we couldn’t put that down as the main reason for me seeing her, because my insurance didn’t cover it. We had to put depression. I stopped seeing her after a few months.\n\nTime passed, I watched youtube videos and read a lot of forums on surgery types, costs, and different methods of hormonal treatment. As someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my testosterone levels were already higher than normal, so I had more facial/body hair, and my voice was slightly lower than most girls. I passed pretty well as a male just from face-to-face interaction, but my voice and breasts were what really gave me away. My sophomore year, I started wearing a binder. It wasn’t the best, as I have really large breasts (thanks mom) but it was better than the sports bras I was wearing. I figured that my name change was what I needed to do next. This was difficult because I was born in Germany, on an American base, and any change to my birth certificate would have to be done through an American Consulate. \n\nMy senior year, I shortened my name from “Brittany” to “Brit.” I told some of my closer friends what I intended to do, but I knew that even after changing my name and starting to transition, it would be difficult because I was going to go to college in the same town that I graduated, which many of my classmates did as well. The end of senior year was tough, because they separated gown colors by gender, and females were required to wear a dress or skirt underneath their gown. I spoke to a very nice vice-principal privately and told her about my disorder, but our principal wouldn’t allow me to wear male colors and sit with the guys. I would, however, be allowed to wear shorts under my gown, and my name would be announced as “Brit _____,” and not my girly full first and middle name. \n\nImmediately following my graduation (June of 2011) I started my name change. I found a local attorney and I dropped $600 to have my name legally changed. I then had to deal with the long wait of processing through the American consulate after sending them documents mid-July of 2011. I had to return my birth certificate (which was a replacement of my original certificate that had been lost during my parents’ divorce), send in the legal name change papers, and pay $50 dollars to have a new one made. After two months of waiting, I was informed I would need a signed document from a notary verifying that it was a replacement birth certificate. \n\nI included a request to have my gender marker changed, and explained my situation. I was emailed and informed that in order to have the gender marker changed, I would need “a notarized physician’s letter that documents subject’s sexual reconstructive surgery that includes the following:\n&gt; * Medial license or certificate number\n\n&gt; * Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate\n\n&gt; * Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to physician\n\n&gt; * Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct. \n\nI was happy to learn exactly what I would need to do so in the future. I received this letter at the end of October, and it was already halfway through my first college semester. My name was still Brittany. I went and spoke directly to an executive in admissions at my college, and explained the situation. I told her that I really wanted my name changed because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would take before I received the paperwork, and that I felt uncomfortable with my name in my classes. She was very nice about and said she would see what she could do. She ended up changing my name in the system, and said that I would need to turn in the necessary documents as soon as possible (i.e., new driver’s license, new social security card, and new birth certificate). \n\nDecember rolled around and I finally got the paperwork from the American Consulate. Changing my drivers license was very easy, but I was nervous because I had heard that a lot of trans get flak from people at the DMV. I thought I would need my new birth certificate, but I found out that all I really needed was my legal name change documents (so I could have had my driver’s license changed since the summer… *facepalm*). Next was the social security office, and they asked for the legal name change paperwork, my new birth certificate, and my ID. That also went over very smoothly.\n\nAt the end of December, I decided to go and see my old Endocrinologist to see if there was anything they could do for me. I spoke to my doctor, told him that I have GID and that I wanted to start hormonal therapy, and if he knew of any place that I could go to because my insurance wouldn’t pay for it. My doctor said that they could take care of me, and that he actually had a few other patients who were trans that were being treated there. I was so relieved, and made an appointment for blood work, and then an injection. \n\nAlthough I pay out of pockets, my injections are kept off of the record from my insurance company and I have a $12 copay to have actual doctor visits. My injections are $39 per injection, but most of the price is a fee to have a nurse administer the injection (required by my Endocrinologist because of their company policy, it may be different for you). I get these twice a month and see my Endocrinologist once every 3-4 months.\n\nMy first injection was January 20th, 2012. Already having more testosterone than normal because of my POS, most of my changes happened quickly—within the first 3-5 months of being on testosterone. Some of the good things: my voice deepened pretty quickly, I noticed a steep increase in facial and body hair, and there’s definitely been an increase in libido, although I already had a pretty active sex drive before T. Some of the bad things: my acne got worse (again), and I get a lot more irritable and angry around injection time. \n\nHere’s a sample of how much my voice has changed (Sorry for the quality of the first one):\n\n[January 20th, 2012.]( https://soundcloud.com/paranoiaway/2012-voice)\n\n[January 20th, 2013]( https://soundcloud.com/paranoiaway/2013-voice)\n\nHere’s an example of my facial hair.
