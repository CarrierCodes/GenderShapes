Now, to why I wanted to post.
I made the conscious decision to come out to one of my roommates yesterday. One already knew, but the other didn't.
She(The one that didn't know)  received it very well, and responded just as well. She informed me that she didn't care what I was, and that she would be my friend regardless. (She's like a mother to me) She told me I cold dress how I wanted to, and that she wouldn't judge me for it.

My next step is to come out to my family. It's very risky, since my sister's part of the family is very 'God' oriented. My father is very old fashioned, and doesn't seem very accepting of the LGBTQ community.  
I know coming out to my dad and sister won't be very easy. I'm afraid  more of how my sister will handle it, because I love my two nephews a lot, and I don't want to be cut off from them. My dad I'm still worried about, but there's a slight bit less riding on how he reacts compared to my sister.

I'm not trans, but I am bisexual, so I am part of (if only in a small way) part of the LGBT community, and I find that I have mixed emotions regarding everything regarding Chelsea's announcement.

On one side she deserves to live life as she feels most comfortable, but on the other side I feel like the announcement comes at a very delicate time and threatens to give ample ammunition to the transphobes in much of the news world. Rather than focusing on the whistleblowing on its moral/ethical basis, I'm worried that her actions will be overshadowed by her gender identity and that it'll all be dismissed as ""someone really confused and emotionally unstable"" rather than examining the two situations (the whistleblowing and the switch from man to woman). I almost feel like she should have waited a bit longer, let the media storm die down before making the announcement, rather than doing it now and running the risk of further marginalizing the trans community. 

What does everyone think? As someone looking in from the outside, its easy for me to have a more critical opinion because I lack the same empathy for the situation that you all share, and there is a much greater impact of an announcement regarding gender identity than sexual preference, so my effort at putting myself in your shoes is ineffective at best.

As someone looking in from the outside, its easy for me to have a more critical opinion because I lack the same empathy for the situation that you all share, and there is a much greater impact of an announcement regarding gender identity than sexual preference, so my effort at putting myself in your shoes is ineffective at best.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you all on this topic!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Question for the trans community regarding Chelsea Manning', 'created': 1377405033.0}"
2013-08-25 06:56:09,1l1ob8,10,7,"So first off this is from a cell phone so pardon the obvious side effects. 

I. . .  I really dont know what to say.  I cant stop thinking about the possibility of living as a woman.  (I am currently male).  If I have free time to think, I wonder how family would react.  Friends.  What would change about life.  i fantasize about magical events that would leave me female.  Winning the lottery and using the money for procedures.  Becoming my dark souls character XD  Let me just put out my own list of I guess pros and cons.  

Pros.
I think I would be happier with myself.  
I think I would be more comfortable.
I would spend less time thinking about how much life will suck as a male.
I wouldn't have to sneak into my moms room to look at her clothes and wish I would look halfway nice in them, if I could ever wear them.  
I wouldnt find thinking of the future so absolutely depressing and frustrating.  
Generally probably being just happier and more content with myself

Cons
My parents are lds.  I have no idea how they would react.  Probably try to convince me I am wrong then argue then quote scripture and in the end my mom would be crying and everyone would be awkward if not straight up angry at me.  Except my brother.  He would be the chill one...
I have no monetary way to do any sort of hormone therapy or buy new clothes or do any kind of surgery.  That also means no money for a councillor (probably spelled wrong) or anything like that, hence dr. Reddit...
Social stigmas in getting jobs, houses, or just living.  
My friends. . .  I know a few of them would be put off to say the least.
The fact I would make an ugly woman with body hair and being overweight and all that crap.  (Though overweight is kinda improving I guess)
And lastly, I am attracted to girls, so throw being a lesbian on top of trans.


I dont know.  I dont understand what I think or feel or what.  All I know is that the weight of the whole thing is suffocating and I dont know if its just me being silly or if I actually feel this way.  Fuck this all sounds so cheesy.  I dont know what to do about feeling this way.  My mentality so far has been ignore it it will go away or I will move on.  
Well that changed for me when I picture my future and contemplate if my current future is worth anything.  Then I think about alternatives.  

If all this just sounds like normal teenage angst, just tell me so I can try to move on from it.  I dont know.  If its real, well I still dont know. 
If this isnt the right subreddit, sorry.  I generally lurk so this is new.  For a lot of reasons.

Edit: 
Just wanted to give you guys an update and thank you again for your help.  I feel I am transgender, and will hopefully be able to talk to a school councillor about it this year, as well as my brother and one of my friends.  
Again, thank you guys/girls so much for the help.  I was pretty sure that if I didnt tell anybody about my feelings I would suffocate.  ♡
