2013-07-03 11:11:05,1hk6xr,3,10,"So, here's my bit of background:  Grew up in a very conservative religious home.  Mom caught me wearing her clothes once or twice, had a few other run-ins getting caught with t-porn and crossdressing, etc...which eventually led to awful confusing and upsetting counselling sessions at my church.

Tally up about a decade of self-hatred, confusion, insecurity, compulsive eating, self-destructive behavior, binges, purges (crossdressing, not bulimia, though I dabbled in that on occasion too), and so on...

Almost 30, I meet the love of my life...she's LGBT-friendly, and I know this, but she doesn't know my secret. She continually expresses open-mindedness in the bedroom, but it takes me 3 years broach the subject.  

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

History lesson over...incoming novella:

Over a few days, she cycles through a few of the stages of grief before my eyes, denying I'm ""really"" bi, declaring I must be gay (not in a hurtful way), until she eventually realizes I'm still madly in love with her, I only have romantic interest in women (namely, *her*), but I am sometimes sexually attracted to men.  She's fine with this.  Hell, it's even a bit of a turn-on for her, and we enjoy the role reversal in the bedroom.  

We kinda just keep it there in the bedroom for the next couple years...our little kink.  My crazy little fetish she indulges. I think this is more my doing than hers...my reluctance to give up what little ground I've gained.  I don't want to push her past her comfort level and lose even the sexy time roleplay.

Recently, we both started down the path of losing weight and getting healthy.  We both have significant amounts of weight to lose, and my size is something that's kept me from dressing up in recent years. I just don't feel attractive.  


Lately we've been watching makeup vids (or rather she has, and I've been watching over her shoulder, commenting, making remarks about liking this, or wanting that).  I commented offhand that I wanted to celebrate reaching our weight loss goals (still probably a year or more away) by taking a trip, spending the day getting pampered, dressing up, and having a girl's weekend out together.  Go shopping, go to a club, flirt, the whole deal...then return to the hotel (maybe with a new boy toy in tow) to have some fun.  

She liked the idea quite a bit.  So I probed and prodded and asked questions...and she was unfazed.  She thought it sounded like perfect fun.  I kept making more and more comments, and thinking out loud, and she's happily nodding and agreeing with all of it.  

The next day, I came home to something completely unexpected.  She hands me a bottle of nail polish.  ""You like?  I picked the color for you.""

""You mean...you picked the color thought I'd like to see *you* wear...or you picked out the polish for *me* to wear??""

""For you to wear...I thought it would look good on you.""

....

I almost cried...my heart welled up.  That small gesture, indicating so much acceptance of who I was and who I *want* to be...it meant so much more than she could have imagined.  And it set loose a torrent of thoughts and ideas and questions.  I kept asking her questions...exploring...leading up to stuff like, would she care if I grew out my hair?  Would she go shopping with me?  Would she be upset if I shaved my body?  When we buy a house, can I have my own clothes and makeup? She was completely fine with ALL of it.  

Even though I know she likes manly hairy guys, she would be completely ok with me taking whatever steps I wanted to be passable when I dress up.  She loves me just as I am, and would even still be attracted to me en femme.  Because of my relationship/baggage with my family, and the drama it'd create for my young son, I told her don't see myself transitioning...I am just so grateful to be able to express this side of myself openly and without shame to the person I love most in the world.  

While it may be a strain down the road (I'll deal with it then), having a ""alter ego"" right now kind of appeals to me.  I want to see how ""Jules"" handles things differently than ""Jeff""...I want to ""meet"" that side of me, and I think my wife is just as excited.

Still amazed at her comfort level with this whole thing, I asked her what her limits would be, and she said she wouldn't be comfortable with me having surgery, which is fine, since I couldn't hide that from my family anyway....as nice as having my own breasts would be, even I'm not ready to think about something that permanent.  I'm still very new to approaching this without shame and fear and self-loathing.

My only regret is not telling her sooner...both for her own sake, and because things might have taken a different path...maybe if before my son had been born, I'd have considered telling my family and living as a woman for awhile...but between the family drama and the potential fallout for my baby boy, sharing this with my wife is enough for now.

I hope someone here finds this encouraging.  The world can be an awful, harsh place, but there *are* people out there who will love you exactly as you are.  Don't settle for less.

2013-07-23 00:13:29,1iumba,2,4,"OK, this is all too new to me so it's going to be a long text about a lot of different stuff. In short, the situation is: I'm a guy, I want to be a girl. The long version is long and I'm confused. English is not my main language, so I'm sorry for any mistakes. If something is not clear, just let me know and I'll fix it.

OK, so I'm a guy. I'm 28, Brazilian, and I'm married to a wonderful girl that I love. I have wanted to be a girl as far as I can remember, but I grew up in a traditional family and I learned it was wrong. To make me even more confuse, I am sexually attracted to women, not men.

So I grew up always telling myself to forget this bullshit of wanting to be a woman. Deep down I always wished to be Mistique (from the X-men comics), a mutant that can change her own body at will.

**When I was a teen I used to imagine myself being a woman**, with a nice body and wearing nice dresses. When I was masturbating I used to imagine me as a woman in sexy situations. But I just kept telling myself it was me thinking weird stuff because I had no girlfriend.

I started dating very late. I was 18 when I had my first kiss. I dated one girl for one year, then we broke up. Half a year later (it was 2005) I met this wonderful girl and we started dating. Many years later, in September 2012, we got married.

I am very lucky because this girl is a psychologist. During these years we are together she has helped me undo a lot of mental programming that society did to me. She helped me get rid of prejudices, fears, and a lot of stuff. We grew a lot together.

But after all this time I still imagine me as a woman to help me get aroused. I look at picturesof women wearing sexy dresses and imagine the woman is me, being sexy to my wife. I see lesbian movies and I imagine I am one of them and my wife is the other. When I have sex with my wife I imagine we're both women.

This week, for the first time in my life, I accepted that I want to be a woman. I stopped fighting against my own desires. So... **today I told my wife I want to be a woman**. She was a bit shocked, but not much. I've always been a feminine guy. Not too much feminine, I'm not mistaken for gay or anything, but not a masculine guy in behavior.

The best thing is that she will support me. She will stand by me if this is what I want for my future. **But I am afraid**.

So, after this long text, these are my main worries. In the next paragraphs I will list everything that worries me. I need your help and experience.

**1) Sex life**

I love sex and so does my wife. Can I have a regular sex life if I become a full woman? Will I still be able to have orgasms? Can I have orgasms with penetration? And masturbating by myself? Will the hormones lower my desire for sex? And can we really have full sex pleasure if she's not a lesbian?

Edit to clarify: I love sex and sexual plays, but I am (obviously?) not very satisfied with my body during sex. But even with this problem I still love sex and I think about sex almost every day.

**2) The surgery**

I am afraid of the surgery. I am a guy that almost pass out when I have to take a vaccine. When I tried to donate blood I passed out even before the needle was inside me.

Does it hurt too much? Are there significant risks of death?

And my main fear: I live in Brazil, not a first world country. What are the risks of me becoming a genderless abomination instead of a woman?

**3) I am too man-like in appearance**

I'm not too masculine in behavior, but I am very masculine in appearance. I have a lot of hair everywhere. A LOT. My wife said I am the hairiest man she has ever seen. I even have a lot of hair in places many other men don't have too much, like my feet. My toe has a lot of hair!

And hair is not the only problem. I have a very masculine facial structure, with a very masculine nose and a very masculine brow. With a masculine mouth.

**I want to be a pretty woman**, I don't want to look like the tranny we see here near interstate roads in Brazil that look like an ugly caricature of a woman.

I want to be a pretty woman because I want my wife to still be sexually attracted to me. I want her to desire my body. I don't mean I want to be a model. I just want to look like an average woman.

This number 3 is my main worry. Is it possible to become an attractive woman if I am a manly man? Do I have to go to other countries and do surgeries that will break the bones in my face to try and make me a prettier woman?

**EDIT**

**4) Is it too late?**

OK, I forgot to add this one. I see many people starting their treatment during teen years, or early twenties. I'm almost 29 and I'm afraid I am too old to start it now. I am afraid that I will only have **some** feminine features, but I will never look like a woman like people that started treatment when 16 years old.

But I have a few questions as far as transitioning goes

Is it a good idea to start trying to gain a little weight when I start?  I'm a bit of a stick, not hefty at all.  Will the fat be stored where a female would store it right from the get go?

Is there anything I can do to ensure I have decently perky breasts?  I've seen some ugly results from mtf hrt, but I want some pretty bussoms :b

2013-07-26 17:20:50,1j3wfy,8,9,"About a year ago, I decided that it was time to do something about my facial hair. So I went in for what I thought was laser treatment, though I found out it was actually IPL when I went in for my first treatment (i.e. after I was already out $1,000+). The pain was borderline unbearable, and after 8 sessions, I was barely seeing any results (unsurprising in retrospect, given that it's IPL). So I stopped going.

I knew that electrolysis was guaranteed to give better results, but I was also scared to death of the pain. Everyone I had talked to said that electrolysis was much more painful than laser, and I didn't want to traumatize myself.

Anyway, I decided to take the plunge and get an electrolysis consultation, just so I could see how bad it actually was. And... *it wasn't bad at all*. I only had 5 minutes of treatment, but it basically didn't hurt, even on my upper lip. In contrast, even a single flash of IPL left me wincing in pain.
