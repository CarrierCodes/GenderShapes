The responses were really nice and helpful, so I thought I'd come to you with another question: Since last time I have mentioned these feelings to my therapist (Note: not the original reason I went to her, I just started therapy for my social anxiety), and she said while of course this might be genuine and that'd be completely fine, it might be the case that I'm just going through a phase of questioning my sexuality and role, as is apparently not that uncommon, and that it might be best to wait for a while and see how I feel later. Especially since it might be connected to my social anxiety, as sort of a way for my subconscious to avoid social expectations by changing my gender role.

The thing is, I don't feel like this is the case; I've only had these feelings of transsexuality for about 2 months consciously, but in my opinion they explain a lot; before puberty I didn't really care about my body, during puberty it just felt kinda awkward and uncomfortable the whole time, and now I'm just getting more and more unhappy with it.

It seems to me that I finally found out why I was never proud of or comfortable in my body in my whole life, and I don't want to waste time anymore if it could be so much better if I just went ahead and followed through with it, especially since transition would probably work better the younger I am (19 right now).

I came out to my family not too long ago, I can't actually remember when though, I don't think it's been a year but I do think it has been over several months and they say they will support me but to be quite honest, they've made little attempt to call me by my desired and now legal name or use the correct pronouns. Anyway, that's not what I am seeking advice about, just a little about me.

As I said, I want to start HRT and though I haven't had much of a real-life experience living as a female since most of my experience has been online and I am an introvert, I have changed my name legally, I am beginning to dress the way I want to although I have always done in a sense, my desired fashion style is often more unisex than anything else, I have also expressed my desire to begin the entire path of transitioning, including HRT, to my GP. I have been referred to a psychosexual service (that I have to travel quite a distance to reach) to, I am assuming, discuss my transsexualism, my desires and I suppose to be 'evaluated' to see if I am infact 'suitable' for transitioning services. However the waiting list for this is some 10 months long and I do not wish to wait that long just for an initial evaluation only to hope that I get the go-ahead to start HRT. 10 months is a long time. Given that I've been anxious to start for about 5 years now, I'm getting tired of waiting and I feel like I'm losing most of my life by waiting around, I feel like I've lost my childhood and teen years to being caged up as someone I'm not. Things need to change and change very soon.

I've been considering going back to my GP and asking if there is a possibility of me beginning prescription HRT without any kind of recommendation letter. I'm not quite sure how it works. I'm at the point where I will look into self-administerd options if I do indeed have to wait 10 months and most likely longer before I will get any kind of help from my medical community.

My question is, does anyone have any advice or personal experiences that can relate to my story and predicament and perhaps help me out? Has anyone from the UK gone through a similar experience and was it possible to get prescription HRT without going through therapy first? Any and all comments would be very welcome.

I'm a 22 MTF individual who is in the final year of college. I'm out to my family only but plan to be publicly out by the time I graduate in November 2014. I'm quite happy with how the whole process has gone so far and I'll be much happier when I can finally be completely honest about the real me with everyone.

While coming out has been a mainly positive experience so far, I do find myself now just wanting to get some part of the transition process underway. My day to day thoughts have drifted further and further away from my college work and more towards starting to transition in a years time. This has obviously led to me being quite frustrated and disconnected from everything else in my life. It feels as if everything else is just sort of happening around me and I'm just playing my part. Honestly, if I could drop out tomorrow and start transitioning, I would! However, it's my final year and I really want to graduate without any major issues.
