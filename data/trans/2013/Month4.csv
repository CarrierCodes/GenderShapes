2013-04-30 19:36:49,1dfitz,6,2,"I really feel like I am a woman, but I am male bodied. I really want to start HRT, and I am able to. I have felt this way strongly for over 2 years, and had inklings all my life. I am 24, will be 25 on June 1.

However...

I am scared of losing my sex drive, especially as my fantasies are very masculine in nature; in fact, because they are so masculine, I feel like I am genderfluid sometimes. But I never want to present male in public.

I also feel guilty for my fantasies sometimes;

* I am into BDSM, and love being able to penetrate. I know I could use a strapon, but I have no idea if that would have the same effect for me, let alone someone who would accept it as an alternative; let alone any lesbian who would be willing to accept a transwoman :/ (This is because I am homoflexible, and do not like standard bodies of men. I don't know if this is because it just reminds me of my own body.) 

* I am into DaddyDom / Ageplay, and I am into rape play. (I realize this can look very bad, but I do not want to do anything with anyone except adults and 100% consensual.)

I want to just start HRT but I know that its something that I can't exactly reverse. Any advise would be helpful!

TL,DR: I am a pre-everything transwoman scared of losing sexual desires/fantasies, or worse yet, keeping them when I can never again act them out. Is this irrational?

As an amusing anecdote: before I was able to submit, the captcha was:

HRTFOU

or:

HRT for you

It's kind of lamely encouraging:

*EDIT* I also wanted to add that I HAVE considered the idea that me being into rape play and daddydom are two sides of the same coin of my body trying to understand who I am.
