2013-02-02 15:52:19,17r8ed,0,1,"Cliff notes version:

-My single very earliest memory is crossdressing with my sisters' dance costumes and loving it.

-Starting at age 5 I inexplicably wanted to transform into a girl and I would daydream about it all of the time

-The thoughts subsided during my elementary school years and I had a normal male childhood, but it came back full force at puberty

-The thoughts turned sexual in nature

-Began cross dressing

-To cope with my desire to transform into a girl, I compartmentalized my transgender feelings into sexual fantasies.

-I've never been able to sexually fantasize about being a man in a relationship with a woman, I've always had to be the woman. This led to immense frustrating trying to ""make the pieces fit,"" trying to force myself into the male role in heterosexual fantasies.

-I realized I had a huge problem at 18 and began therapy

-Psychiatrist has had me on every anti-depressant/anxiety in the book. Right now I'm on 4 (celexa, welbutrin, fanapt, and xanax)

-I've been to seven therapists. The gender therapist I saw for only 5 visits because I ran out of money, he seemed to think I was transgender.

-Depressed out of my mind. Not looking forward to anything in life, no hopes or dreams. Having panic attacks every night.

-At 20 I tried an HRT trial, but I got scared and was uncertain, so I quit after 20 days.

-Now at 21, the feelings feel unbearable being in a male body but having the desires to have a female body.

-Not trying to be crude, but to cope with my feelings, I have to sexually fantasize about being a woman multiple times a day just to get any relief.

-Binge eating to cope with my feelings, currently overweight

-I feel hopeless because these feelings are for life, there's no cure.

-Feels like I'm heading towards mental illness if I can't get my depression and anxiety and mental anguish under control.

-I'm considering trying another HRT trial, but I'm not sure how things will be different this time. I'm not sure how I would know if it was right for me. When I would know in my heart that it was for me.

2013-02-10 08:17:31,188mvz,8,3,"UPDATE: 

Results happened. 

I came out to my girlfriend sometime mid-October. 
I had been withdrawing from her, (a result of desperately trying to come up with a ""safe"" (lolz) way of telling her all of this... stuff) and she had started to suspect there might be another girl in my life. 

Only when she threatened to go stay in a hotel for a spell did I realise I had been well and truly backed into the corner I had hoped/expected I eventually would.

I sat her down (with berry cream cheese frosted cupcakes) and ... said it. ""I'm transgendered. I'm a woman.."" and the rest. I took it slow, i think. She listened, nodded, looking at me stonefaced.

It dawned on her slowly that I wasnt joking, and at that point it hit her like a ton of bricks. 
She disappeared to the bathroom, and after a few minutes I realised I should probably go check on her. 
And.. at this point I realised just how close I was to losing her. She was disgusted, infuriated, heartbroken. I think she actually said ""you broke my heart"". (A lot of this day is a blur. I'm okay with that, this isnt a day I want to remember really).

As the day went on, jokes were made, more tears were shed. There was vomiting (stress related, not the cupcakes), she went to the bedroom, asked me not to follow her. I passed out on the couch (and felt terrible for it, ""how does one have a nap at a time like this?!"" i thought, but... a stressful few weeks will do that) and by the evening we were cuddling on the couch. 

Since then, almost every day has been a struggle in its own right. 
Sometimes the struggle is all hers, battling with her dreams of our future, the possibility of what it might be now, whether she should just cut and run and try again with a man, or whether she can learn to be attracted to a woman... who used to be her Man. 

Sometimes the struggle is mine. The desire to start transitioning, the frustration in waiting (though I've never been asked to, I want to take it slow for the people around me.) the same fantasy of cutting and running, all pretty and glowy with the idea of being independant, single, with only myself to blame and disappoint and make proud, though I know this isnt what I want. 
I truly believe we have something special, the kind of thing the people around me moan about never being able to find, and I believe we're strong enough to make it work.

What We've Been Doing:

During a therapy session (We've had 3 haphazard sessions so far, when things have gotten bad) girlfriend mentioned how none of this seems real, and she finds herself believing that all of this trans-BS has gone away. 
Then, when she's reminded of the reality of it, it crushes her, worse and worse each time. 

My therapist suggested we simply role-play. Dress up in the clothes I have, do some makeup, watch tv in girlmode together. 

This has helped a lot, actually. Much more than I expected. 

First was just clothes, and it was awkward. (Made worse by EP102 of Orange is the New Black, Laverne Cox's first real appearance), but... we survived it. 

Second time was different. Same thing, she made dinner, I showered and shaved my face to within an inch of its life, and put on a cute tunic and leggings. We just existed, not thinking, not asking, not talking about ""it/us/future"". 

Third time was wild. GF suggested doing my makeup, and we actually had fun with it. She told me I looked pretty, my heart skipped a beat. My mind was filled with a hope I hadnt felt in... at least a year. Thoughts of two wedding dresses danced across my mind as I fell asleep that night.

And this is where we are now. Still together, struggling, but fighitng the fight. 

TL:DR: Came out to girlfriend, still together.

Hi reddit. 

Long time lurker, recent contributor. 
As is customary of this subreddit, I'm sure. 

Short: 
how do I come out to my girlfriend of four years that I'm trans?

Long:
We've been together for four years, friends online for twice that. 
She came across the ocean to South Africa four years ago, and has lived with me since. We've travelled back and forth from SA to USA, and have a very strong bond. 

[before I go any further, since GF reddits far more than I do: 
Girlfriend, Id you read this, I'm sorry, and I love you more than anything. ]

She lives and works with me and my parents at our family run business, and we have plans on moving out eventually. (Well, ASAP, really. She wants to get started on creating a Life together)

I feel like my hands are tied. We're usually together 99% of the day, so going the therapist route (getting a letter, etc) seems out of the question. 
Unfortunately it's the route I would rather take, since SO is a serious sceptic, and I'm dreading her asking the question ""are you sure?"".
(Just to be clear, I'm not really questioning anymore, but can anyone be 100% sure in this situation? There's always that sliver of self doubt. With me anyway)

I'm sorry if this comes across as haphazard, its 3am. I'm on a roof taking photos of lightning, I'm coming down with the flu, but worst of all... I'm just really sad. 

Sad at the idea of losing her. She's one of the most important things in my life, if not THE most important. 
She's taught me more about myself and the world than I could ever have imagined. 
I'm terrified of breaking her heart. 
I'm terrified of the moment after telling her how I feel. What happens, the silence. The tears. Will she stay out of stubbornness or obligation? Will she leave? She doesn't have enough cash to get a ticket home. I'm afraid, straight up. 

Would I rather keep this inside, and pretend it'll go away eventually?

This (Removed) and this (http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/j4kqx/i_now_know_i_will_probably_never_be_able_to_come/) say no. We all know it won't. We all know the best time to do it is now.

Please help, reddit. I feel like I'm nearing a breaking point. I told myself I'd make 2013 the year of change. The starting point on a long and belated journey. 

If I've left things out, or you want more info on something, please say. I just need some pro tips on how to start the sentence.

I\'m afraid, straight up. \n\nWould I rather keep this inside, and pretend it\'ll go away eventually?\n\nThis (Removed) and this (http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/j4kqx/i_now_know_i_will_probably_never_be_able_to_come/) say no. We all know it won\'t. We all know the best time to do it is now.\n\nPlease help, reddit. I feel like I\'m nearing a breaking point. I told myself I\'d make 2013 the year of change. The starting point on a long and belated journey. \n\nIf I\'ve left things out, or you want more info on something, please say. I just need some pro tips on how to start the sentence. \n', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Coming out troubles', 'created': 1360509451.0}"
