When I met him, I didn't know he was trans. He added me on facebook, and because of a few things he posted, I gathered that this was the case. Before we really started to get to know one another, I talked to my 3 closest friends about him and the fact that I thought he was trans. 

I wasn't very familiar with the etiquette that might be involved in such things, and have since educated myself better. I'm afraid that telling my friends about it will be a point of contention. They're all very amazing people, and it doesn't make any more difference to them than it does to me. But I'm worried I've crossed a line before I even knew it was a line that could be crossed. I don't want to upset him. I know that passing is very important to him. 

I'd like to talk to him about it tonight when I see him. I guess I'm asking for advice on how to broach the subject? I'm so very into him, and I don't think he'll be super upset.

I don't know a lot about the trans community, so please forgive &amp; correct me if I get any terminology wrong.

I work at a day-care centre, and one of the children I care for has a very interesting relationship with his/her gender. Biologically, the child is male. I'll call him Tim.

Tim loves to play with hair, wear princess dresses, and have ribbons tied into his/her hair.

More interestingly though, Tim often goes by other names like 'Daisy' 'Sally' and 'Alice'. I overheard a conversation between him/her and another child yesterday: ""You're pretending to be a girl!"" ""No, I am a girl!""

Later, I asked Daisy, ""Will you be Daisy tomorrow?"" ""No, I'm going to be Sally"" ""Do you think you'll be Tim another day?"" ""I don't want to be Tim ever again""

He/she also expresses a strong desire to have ""beautiful, long hair"".

All of the educators roll with it, and call him/her by the name that he/she chooses each day. When I help him/her to get changed on days that she's a girl, I'll call her underwear 'knickers' or 'undies' instead of 'jocks'.
Sometimes other children will say, 'You're not a girl, you're a boy!' and if I hear them, I'll say 'Daisy is a girl today'. Most of the kids pick up on it and call her Daisy for the rest of the day. 

I guess I want to make sure that I'm handling this properly? And find out as much information as I can about very young children who are transgender, anecdotal or otherwise.

I'm currently in a Second language acquisition course, and I'm particularly interesting in the affects of transitioning on second language acquisition. Specifically I want to know what happens pre and post hormonal treatment for transmen and transwomen. Of interest are those that have either learnt a second language and are working on their third post transition or are learning a second during the transition process. But anyone who is trans* identified and has learned a second language and is continuing its use is welcomed. 

What I'll need is around 30 - 60 minutes of time with an interview, either on skype or in-person (if you are in the bay area) about your experiences learning another language. I will need to record the interviews to then transcribe. You will be shown the transcription once I finish and have the ability to edit it. Of course, all interviews will be anonymous and completely voluntary. This can be any language so both native and non-English speakers are fine. Along with learning a ( first or second) signed language. To be a part of this please email me here on reddit.
