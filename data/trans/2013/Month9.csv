To get to the point right away, I (m/19) have recently started to question whether I really want to live the rest of my life as a man. It's not tearing me apart, but the thought is always there and wont leave my head, I think about it every night when I go to sleep and countless times during the day. I don't think I really hate being a man, but I don't feel happy or anything in any way to be one; if I could just magically turn into a girl without anyone noticing the difference I'd do it in a heartbeat. I can acknowledge that men can look good, but no man looks like what I would want to look like if I could just choose freely, if I see myself in the mirror I know it's me, but it feels like what's in my reflection is not what I should see, it's almost as if I'm a little bit surprised that that is what I look like every time I see my face.

I'm already sure I'm not gay however, I can say a man is good looking but I could never think of a man as beautiful in the same way as a women.

I don't know quite what I'm hoping to achieve with this post, maybe some advice, someone I could ask weird questions or just the affirmation that I'm not crazy, because right now I'm just really out of it and don't know what to think or do. I can in no way come out to my parents at this point since I'm also socially anxious and already have an incredibly hard time talking about my feelings at all with anyone, my fingers are literally shaking from being nervous while I'm just typing this.

2013-09-27 03:31:16,1n845j,10,11,"Hello fellow trans boys and girls,

I lived 23 years of my life thinking that I'm a gay man; and it wasn't until a friend's joking/unintentional question ""are you transgender?"" that I realized who I really am - a transgender woman (kinda long story short here...lol maybe another reddit post)

I'm pre-hormone due to financial reason. And I realized that when my friends refer to me as ""she"" in public while I look and dress like a man, it sends a very powerful message to the people around me: gender is an identity, it's not what body you're born with. 

I noticed that there are plenty of photography projects out there that focus on transgender people after the transition or when they dress in the way that matches their gender identity, they're all super awesome. 
But I want to do something bold and new. I want to photograph pre-hormone trans individuals, much like myself, looking/dressing the way that society thinks we are (because of our assigned-at-birth sex) while holding a sign that shows clearly what our true gender identity is.
As an artist, I really enjoy the contrast that lies there, and also the whole thought-provoking experience.

If you live in the Los Angeles area, and you would like to participate in this project, please contact me through this email and we'll schedule a shoot (you can give me as little information about yourself or as much as you'd like. I want you to feel 100% comfortable): 
betweenmyears@gmail.com

Here's the website I created for the project:

If you don't live in LA but you wish to participate, please feel free to email me your submissions at the email provided above :)

Note: 1) if you wish to remain anonymous in the photo, simply hold the sign in front of your face or just crop out your head.
2) the sign can be a stick figure drawing/the gender sign that I used in my photo/or any written words that express your gender identity.

Thank you so much for reading this long post I apologize for the length :/

And if you have any questions or opinions, feel free to let me know :)

2013-09-28 19:42:05,1nbu9y,29,11,"I want to share a brief story and ask for some feedback. I apologize if I use incorrect vocabulary; I'm out of my element.

I am an EMT on a small ambulance service in the Midwest. I've been in EMS for about 10 years. A while ago I was called to assist a woman with severe abdominal pain. We followed our standard treatment protocols, assessing her for various underlying causes ranging from urinary tract infection to appendicitis to internal haemorrhaging.

This woman was generally cooperative and denied any significant past medical history or problems. I asked about family history of ovarian cysts, pregnancies, regular menstruation, and so on, all of which are part of our normal fact-finding checklist. She denied any of the above, and the only odd moment was when my partner asked if she could be currently pregnant and she got angry. That can be a touchy subject under any circumstances, so we didn't pursue that line of questioning much further. We transported her to the hospital, transferred her to the ER, and went home.

A few days later, a friend at the hospital called me to tell me that the woman was MTF transgender. This came as a surprise, having never had a transgender patient in my time in EMS (remember, small town Midwest), and more importantly because she never mentioned anything about it. Nor, in retrospect, did she give any cause to seriously consider it. Nor did she correct my assumption of her sex when I started asking about ovaries &amp; pregnancy.

I don't know her motivations or psychological state, I don't know very much about her at all. Heck, perhaps she thought she appeared so obviously transgender that I couldn't help but realize it, and thus she thought I was a complete idiot when I started asking such irrelevant questions. 

Whatever the case, I was operating without knowing some extremely relevant information about my patient's anatomy. Because of this, I couldn't assess her accurately, and in somewhat different circumstances that could have led to me making significantly incorrect treatment decisions and potentially endangering her health.

Short of adding ""Are you transgender?"" to our assessment questions (which, let me assure you, won't go over well around here), should I have done something differently? 

I know many trans people have encountered ridicule and harassment in medical settings and may be hesitant (and in the case of something like a broken arm it's not relevant). But please, if you're the recipient of emergency medical services, make sure that the EMTs are aware of what anatomy they're dealing with.

2013-09-29 10:37:46,1nd97e,3,3,"So I posted a while ago about my gender confusion and stuff.  Since then I have concluded that I am Trans and do plan on transitioning from Male to Female as soon as possible.  But as a senior in high school the best thing is really to wait until after high school, to avoid that mess.  I have been in contact with the school social worker but that's about it so far.  

I think about it pretty much every day, and in the past couple weeks I have started to think slightly more dark things.  Weighing the pros and cons of life in general.  Which option does less damage to my family/friends.  

Me living and coming out will hurt my parents.  My mom will think she is losing me religiously wise, and probably blame herself and think she is a terrible parent.  I am pretty much my dad's only nerd/guy friend in my stepfamily.  He lives with my stepmom and stepsister so me being a girl too may mess him up more.  My friends will probably be creeped out to say the least.  They may still be ok with me but a few of them will avoid the mess that will become my life.  

OR.  My mom simply loses me.  I'm sure it would be bad, but in her mind, I would be in heaven somewhere.  Not here alive but not in a good way afterlife wise.  My dad would be in the same boat I guess, but at least he wouldn't possibly feel betrayed.  My friends could go on without having to work around my problems to do things like D&amp;D.  Its not like they really need me to do it.  Also parents wouldn't have to give me gas money, pay for food/clothes/all that junk.  They could probably still return my class ring, so thats an extra 300 right there.  I just don't feel like I'm worth the pain.  

Also then I wouldn't have to deal with the inevitable disappointment and shit of going from gentleman whale to lady whale.  As in I'm stupidly fat and hrt tends to cause weight gain.  So thats shitty.  Also I doubt many game companies are looking for fat trans programmers with self confidence issues and zero social skills.  So thats great too.  Also javascript is shit.  
Other topics of thought, what way of killing ones self would be the least inconvenient.  Obviously I don't want to make a huge mess or traumatize a bystander or something.  Also interesting, seems you cannot hold your breath too long or you almost pass out and kinda force yourself to breath again.  
Ever lost interest in your only get away?  Yeah, I can't really enjoy gaming.  Its just frustrating and distracting at this point, which makes me sad.  

I don't really know why I choose to post this.  I guess its my human instinct/self preservation trying to fix the helplessly broken.  It probably just sounds like me whining for attention.  Sorry.
