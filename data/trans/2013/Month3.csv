2013-03-05 05:54:20,19oxnc,17,26,"I'm really sorry for taking up everyone's time by posting this but I don't think I keep keep this anguish to myself anymore and need some guidance...

I'm a (MtF) trans, taking hormones for about 9 months now. About a month ago, I was raped by one of my closest friends who knew me before I started my transition and I'm so scared to do anything about it. 
It was the weekend before I turned eighteen, so a group of my friends took me out for dinner. Afterwards, we all split up and walked home and I was alone with **him**, when he asked if I wanted to stay at his house and call for a ride home. It started hailing really bad, and since his house was closer, I agreed.
When we got to his house, we were both soaking wet and freezing, so instead of calling my parents straight away, I took a few minutes to warm myself upstairs. I got ready to take out my phone, when he, completely naked, comes through the door, grabs my arm and throws my bag aside. I was so shocked that I didn't realize that he was pulling me into his bedroom until it was too late.
He ordered me to strip or he'll hurt me. I initially refused, thinking that this was just a really bad joke, until he punched and kicked me so hard I thought my bones would break. I took off everything except for my bra and undies, and he grabbed my arm again and pushed me onto the bed. Yelling at him, he forcibly removed the rest of my clothing despite my protests, and when I got fully undressed, I realized what a vulnerable position I let myself be in.
I begged him to just let me go, but he responded with things like *""You had this coming,""* and *""You should be happy you're getting laid at all.""* I asked him if he would really do this to a friend. He answered, *""You didn't have to be this girly.""* 
His grip on my arm was really hurting me at that point, and I just wanted to avoid angering him, so I stopped protesting, and what he did next is not something I can bring myself to tell in detail right now. It was incredibly painful, like I was getting crushed and ripped apart at the same time. I was both humiliated and in agony... so much that I wished to die right then, and right now I think I still wish for that.
He abused me for hours until he stopped and went to bed. I cried silently to myself until I could hear his snores. Too afraid to call anyone, I sneaked out early in the morning and ran home in the cold. My parents must have thought I was over at a friend's, so they didn't bother texting me. Afterwards, I kept everything that happened to myself. 
He later said he was sorry over a text, and wanted to continue being my friend if we could forget the whole thing. I told him to leave me alone, but he continues to message me about the incident, saying *""You didn't even hate it since you didn't pass out like real rape victims.""* I've been avoiding him ever since but I can only pretend it didn't happen for so long.

Sorry for that huge read but I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do... I'll feel guilty if I'm responsible for throwing him in jail by pressing charges, and I don't want my other friends finding out that I got raped, or anyone knowing that I'm trans. I'm terrified of him and frightened that he might attack me again. I feel like he could pop out of anywhere behind me and drag me back to his home. I'm scared of revealing this to my boyfriend, because I don't want him to see me in such a pitiful state. I just don't know what to do anymore and I absolutely want nobody to find out about this... I'm afraid of posting here even on a new account in case anybody I know browses /r/trans but I feel like if I don't tell someone soon, I might just do the wrong thing and it can't be fixed.

My big issue is figuring out what the best practices are for this. The AP stylebook says that transsexuals are people who change genders via surgery. It says to use the preferred pronoun for transgenders when they acquire the physical characteristics of the opposite sex or if they present themselves in such a way that doesn't correspond with ""their sex at birth."" If the person doesn't tell you what pronoun to use, to just use the one they use with public presentation.

2013-03-24 13:10:35,1awtvd,1,8,"Hey Everyone:

I am planning to run the Marine Corps Marathon for the Human Rights Campaign, but need to get to $1500 in donations as soon as possible to be one of the 50 people who gets to run for them.

My spouse is transgender, so I'm doing it for her. I first found out about it several years ago when we were still dating (we've been dating since high school actually, and now are almost 30). At first I was shocked and didn't know what to do, but my partner introduced me to Jennifer Finney Boylan's memoir and a couple other books that resonated with me at the time. We talked it out then and we're still together now. 

I think it's incredibly brave and amazing that you guys come out and then make it through the transition process. I'm running to support your right to transition, your right for respect, your right for health care coverage and education, your right for marriage and choice. 

This is an issue that has become important to me in the last several years, though I've always been a supporter of LGBT issues in general. I'm just always shocked by how the 'T' tends to get ignored or discriminated against by the rest of the 'LGB'. 

Anyway... I'm rambling now. The point is, I was hoping you guys could consider either making a donation or passing on this missive to others who might be interested in donating to the cause. I would really appreciate even just a dollar. Anything. I want to run for the HRC.
