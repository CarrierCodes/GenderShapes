I'm one of the editors for a student magazine in the UK, and I'm currently working on an article about the lives of trans* students. 

Several students who identify as trans* have volunteered to be interviewed, so I'm sketching out some questions at the moment. 

I want to explore the reality of life as a trans* students, but I'm not confident of my ability to bring attention to the areas that deserve it, whilst still proving respectful and sensitive. 

If you were in my position, which questions do you think need asking?

Thanks for your help all!

I could go out as who I really am, and nobody would think twice about me! I was just another girl at the parties, or walking on the street, or whatever! I wasn't going full time yet, but I'm very passable even without hormones yet. It was going great! Until my mother found out... She'd known I was 'just a cross-dresser' before I went to college, and even then told me that ""people like you either end up hanging themselves or as cheap tranny hookers that'll blow any guy with twenty bucks in his pocket."" ouch. When she found out that I've been going out like that at college, she flipped her shit. I told her to keep it quiet, and she did. But recently, she told my dad EVERYTHING because she ""couldn't keep lying to her husband."" He's VERY transphobic, so his reaction wasn't anything good... He called me and told me that if I ever make any changes to my body that I'd have no place in his family because he just can't tolerate that. When I came home for holiday break, it got a lot worse. I'd been there for 3 days, and kept arguing with them non-stop. my mother told me that there's 'demons' attacking me and I told her I don't believe that stuff. She replied that I should leave and stay with my sister for a while because I was hurting her family. Last night I left home with as much as I could carry, went to my girlfriend's place, and got my sister to pick me up from there. She'd just moved in to her new apartment, so she didn't have anything unpacked. Just stacks of boxes. We had a good time though. We baked a cake, played cards, smoked, and just talked. It was nice. I'm sad that I had to be kicked out of my parent's house, but I'll do what I can to keep going. I'm at a Barnes and Noble typing this, because my sis doesn't have Wi-Fi hooked up yet. It was a hell of a walk, but I got here. Any advice on what I should do next, r/trans?

TL;DR: I'm trans, my parents found out, they aren't happy. I've been kicked out of my parent's house, and living with my sister for a little while. No idea what to do now.

It was great! I could go out as who I really am, and nobody would think twice about me! I was just another girl at the parties, or walking on the street, or whatever! I wasn\'t going full time yet, but I\'m very passable even without hormones yet. It was going great! Until my mother found out... She\'d known I was \'just a cross-dresser\' before I went to college, and even then told me that ""people like you either end up hanging themselves or as cheap tranny hookers that\'ll blow any guy with twenty bucks in his pocket."" ouch. When she found out that I\'ve been going out like that at college, she flipped her shit. I told her to keep it quiet, and she did. But recently, she told my dad EVERYTHING because she ""couldn\'t keep lying to her husband."" He\'s VERY transphobic, so his reaction wasn\'t anything good... He called me and told me that if I ever make any changes to my body that I\'d have no place in his family because he just can\'t tolerate that. When I came home for holiday break, it got a lot worse.
