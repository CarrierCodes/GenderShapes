2013-06-05 13:32:12,1fpwyj,5,8,"*Preface* I'm not sure exactly why I wrote this but it helped to write, it just flowed straight out of my brain when I got back and I feel better for writing it. I'm not sure what I expect to gain by posting it here, advice? Someone to tell me that they feel the same? Someone to tell me it’s all rubbish? I really don’t know. Being in the float tank has relaxed me in a way that has helped me write all this down for the first time. That's why I'm sharing it now. *&lt;/preface&gt;

So today I went to a floatation tank. I've always wanted to go into one as I've loved the idea of no physical input, and being able to relax and destress totally. It brought on this stream of consciousness, which has turned into almost every thought and feeling I’ve had for years now. It can get kind of graphic in parts. 

But during that pretty amazing experience, my mind went where it always goes when I’m relaxed, or have nothing else to think about.
It went to the woman. That woman inside that I think about and wish I could be. That woman who I’m not sure even exists.

During my float, when all the itches and niggles started to fade away, I started to think. I started to imagine myself as this girl, this young girl, a teenager sitting outside with her boyfriend, and for the first time they kissed, I kissed him, and it was wonderful. That kissing started to get more urgent, both in a physical sense in that I started to imagine that more was happening, some stroking, some touching, but also the mental need that I wanted him. I wanted him to love me and I wanted to feel loved. I wanted that so badly. Things went further and we started having sex, and I wanted it so badly, I wanted to feel him inside me, and I wanted to feel loved by him. This was what I was feeling both as the girl I was imagining, but also as the man inside the tank. As things went further and further this mental and physical feeling built up and up until my body felt full of energy, it felt like an orgasm I’ve never felt before, and it spread throughout my whole body. My toes tingled, and curled into small balls, and my back arched in the air as this feeling built up and up into it just exploded, and I felt as relaxed as I ever could be, with this warm feeling just slowly fading away. 
I desperately wanted to be this woman, and hated the fact that this little experience was over.
I don’t know exactly what I felt, because I’m not sure I’ve ever felt it before, but it felt good all the same. I thought at the time that was I arching my back because that’s how women orgasm? Or is it because I’ve seen that in porn/my own real life girlfriend before? Did that feeling come about because it’s what I’ve heard the female orgasm feel like? My mind then starts to wonder and I start to think if I’m just thinking all of this for my own pleasure, is it a fetish that I like the idea of being a woman? Or does it go deeper? 

I have on many occasions masturbated to the idea of being a woman, but this time in the tank it felt much deeper, perhaps because it was easier to imagine that I was her, and not just some sweaty disgusting man just having a wank to something.

I'm currently 24 and I’ve been thinking about these sorts of things ever since I was around 13/14, when I went through puberty. I was generally a normal child, and didn’t do anything or was interested in anything girly when I was younger, and my mind thinks, ""You can’t be a trans person, because they all know it when they're younger!"" and ""it’s just a sexual fetish"" but then I keep thinking the same thing. I just want to be a girl. 

So these feelings have been going on for nigh on a decade now, which has now become most of my life, my mind has wondered, both during masturbation and on non-sexual thoughts about how I’d be happier as a girl. How I’d want to be looked after by a guy or girl, I’d want to feel the hole between my legs and the boobs on my chest. I’d dye my hair, get a piercing or get a tattoo. I'd dress nice, buy nice clothes and I’d make myself look pretty just because I could. I’d go on dates, fall in love and eventually become a mother, and I’d be happy.  As I came out the float tank today the room was full of ladies conditioners, and so on, so I washed and conditioned my hair with girl’s things, and for a short time it felt amazing. As I guy I have no real interest in doing any of these things at all, but I wish I was a girl so I could feel comfortable doing so. 

I've cross-dressed before, but found it lacking, I’ve played with anal play, with tampons and so on but again found it lacking. I've always felt like some pervy guy just looking weird, but I feel that it would be much better if I could do these things in my everyday life. 

I have a girlfriend, and I’m happy with her and I love her. Sometimes we have fairly normal and fun sex and I love it, it’s great. But sometimes, especially when she jumps on top, I imagine that she's the guy and she's fucking me, that she has me on my back and I find it amazing. I want to feel that so badly.

I worry that it’s just a sexual fetish sort of thing, I’m not really Trans, and it’s all about sex! But then I look at girls, and look past how pretty they are and start to feel jealous, or wish I was them, or just admire their clothes. Then I think to myself I’m only thinking about these things because I want to convince myself it’s not just a fetish of mine.

I don’t think a day goes by without it cropping up in my head, ""I wish I was a girl"" but I deal with it. I don’t get depressed over it, and I’m fairly accepting on myself as a man. I don’t like everything about it but some stuff is pretty damn cool. But I still feel again that I’d be happier as this girl, or at least the image of one I have in my head. I've looked into hormones, and I’ve looked at pictures of people going through the process and read their stories. I've seen the good ones and the bad ones, and I’ve thought the good ones look so beautiful, but the bad ones just look like men. I don’t think I could ever go through the process myself because I’m terrified of ending up looking terrible. But I also say, what’s the point? I've missed out on the best stuff already, growing up as a girl, getting to be young and free. I'd probably lose my whole family, my job, some friends and my girlfriend if I decided to go through with the actual change, so I know that I never will, because I want to be 100% girl, or nothing. 

I read sci-fi books, like the culture series where they can change gender at will, and I’m so incredibly jealous of that, but it makes me optimistic for the future. I can’t wait for that possibility to happen in my lifetime. Whether it’s VR, body swapping, perfect surgery or whatever does come, I can’t wait and I hope so madly and badly that I can become that 100% a woman, feel what she feels and live my life the way I want. But I know I could never do it now. And then my mind starts to think, does that mean I’m not Trans? I think about death from time to time, and earlier depression when I was younger, including a failed suicide attempt, may have been brought on partially by all these thoughts and feelings. I'm not sure. I hope so badly and want to believe in reincarnation, just so I can grow up and be the woman I want to be.

I honestly just don’t know what goes on in my head anymore, but this single thought runs around my head, it gets in there every day and for the last 10 years, it’s rarely been absent.

""I want to be a woman""

I just wish I knew whether it was real or not.

TL DR - I'm so fucking confused.
