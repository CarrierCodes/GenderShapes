(I will also be referring to my sibling as they/them only because of the confusing mess we’re in right now, but we are suspecting they may be FTM trans.)

hello! i’m 17 years old and have a little sibling that will be 6 in just a few days. since they could talk, they have been telling us that they are a boy. when they were 2 we decided to just ignore it as they weren’t very persistent about it and would rarely bring it up (yknow... because they were 2). i currently live with my grandparents but my sibling lives with our mother and their father. every single time for the past year or so when my sibling comes to town the FIRST and i mean the VERY FIRST thing they will tell us is “I am a boy today, please call me (preferred masculine name).” my grandparents and i are very very supportive and try our best to call them by their preferred pronouns he/him and their preferred name. we do slip up sometimes and when we do so they usually correct us. so, we call my mom and ask if they’ve been doing this at their house. she tells us no, and that she doesn’t know why they’re doing it at our house.
well, come to find out my step dad (my siblings biological father) is transphobic and told us that if my sibling was actually trans his first reaction would be “eww”. my mother is diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder and gets very upset when my sibling wants to cut their hair short, and usually convinced them not to. 
my step dad has even gone to the lengths to say that my sibling is manipulating us, because their next door neighbor is trans and my sibling just thinks it’s cool (even though they have been saying this for 3, almost 4 years)
there are a lot of other things that my mother and step father do that makes me believe that my sibling only feels comfortable at my house, because apparently they love wearing dresses and skirts at my moms house but NEVER at my house. 
we have pictures all over our house that they drew that are signed with their masculine name. they also drew a “self portrait” with NO prompt whatsoever, which i have added a picture of to show that they see themselves as a boy, and again signed it with their preferred name. 
i know this is very long but i just want to ask if there is anything i can do to help my sibling? is this really just a phase? or is it just too early to decide? i really want to make them as happy and comfortable as possible as i’m terrified of what may happen in the future if my parents continue this behavior. what can i tell my parents to help them understand more? please i really need help i’m genuinely scared of what may happen in the future....",trans,"please, please help me",1614726005.0,"{'created_utc': 1614700805, 'id': 'lw5bbn', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I want to start this off by saying I am not trans but I have always been a huge ally and have never been shy to admit it.

At first they taught it was all weird, especially during my change.

Now for a while they started dressing like i do and pretty much mimic everything. They wear masculine clothes, cut their hair and did pretty much whatever I'm doing. Now they came out as trans.

I don't know what to say, i know for a fact kids can know when they're trans from a really young age, im just concerned that maybe I'm influencing them too much, and maybe that's not them.

2021-03-02 17:50:00,lw81wk,2,1,"Hey, posting here to see if I can find anyone else going through something similar to me. I'm feeling quite alone and uncertain. I'm a transmasc non-binary person who's just started T (two weeks tomorrow; really low dose), and I'm a singer--specifically, I'm a soprano, and a pretty good one. I have a very strong head voice and my range pre-T went all the way up to the E above the staff. I'm also neurodivergent and use singing in my top range as one of my most favourite stims, but this is more about my singing than my stimming.

I really, really love singing high. Losing that was one of my biggest misgivings about starting T; I want my speaking voice to be lower/more masculinized (plus many of the other impacts of T) but I'm quite upset at the idea of losing my high singing voice. I don't plan on going through a complete vocal change, either; I always planned on calling it as it went, as I really just want a more androgynous voice. I tend to like the way people sound five months or so on T (though I know that varies a lot; just trying to give a ballpark of what I'm looking for). I went through a period where I was more comfortable with the idea of my singing voice changing in the time leading up to starting T, but I immediately got the 't cold' and even how that shaved just the top few notes off of me destabilized me, and now I just had my first singing lesson in a few years today all that uncertainty has come roaring back. It just really reminded me of how much reach and power I have up there, and I don't want to sound conceited, but I feel like I'm trading away a valuable gift without knowing what I'm going to be getting back. I have no idea if it's going to be worth it or not. I'm scared as hell that it won't be.

I've found some stuff of other transmasculine people who are singers going through voice changes, and that has been comforting, but never specifically sopranos who really rely on that top range to be like... a good singer. It's not just that I feel like my upper range is my ace in the hole--even though it is helpful, I don't necessarily feel like having those top notes are what make or break me as a singer. It's that my voice literally just doesn't have the power or body to be satisfying to me--or have the potential to sing in opera, which I want to do--until I hit that soprano range, sort of a D and up for me. What if I lose that and never get it back? There's a chance that I'll still be happy with whatever becomes my higher range, and there's a chance that my very strong head voice right now will translate into a strong head voice as a more masculine falsetto but the fact that I *don't know* is killing me. I'm close to tears writing this. I don't know if I should just stop T, at least for now, before I really get a more noticeable amount of change, or if this is something I need to just grieve and push through, and I know that's entirely up to me and if I think it's going to be worth it for me but right now I'm just feeling very shaky and would like to know if there was or is anyone else who went through or is going through something similar.

However, I'm coming to terms with being trans (ftm) and skirts have made me increasingly more uncomfortable. I don't want to play on the team anymore and honestly the sport isn't that fun.

And if i do say i want to quit, they'll ask for a reason which is mainly because of the discomfort. However, i don't want to come out.

I've identified as transgender for 20 plus years, I say 20 plus because 20 years ago I learned the word transgender existed and perfectly described feelings I've had since grade school.  I'm currently 37 and began transitioning six months ago, my second attempt. The first one ended for financial and life reasons in my early 20s and I retreated back into the closet for a while.  I went to college at 24 and became an active member and leader in the schools LGBTQ group and fought to get gender identity and expression added to the universities non discrimination clause. I became a regular at the local LGBTQ bar in town going out at least once a week sometimes dressed sometimes not.

The discussion I want to have though is that despite having experience and activity with my trans identity I dont want a trans identity. I think for me I can sum up those feelings best with the song ""Most Girls"" by Hailee Steinfeld. It's not that I'm anti transgender as I thing I've proven by my activism, although I can admit I struggle with that identity because of climate and culture in the United States.

The question I want to propose is this: Is not wanting a trans identity more indicative of the nature of being transgender and wishing I just was what I'm not, or an indicator that I need to work on my views of accepting myself as transgender still  because regardless of how I feel I'm gonna be stuck with a trans identity and that I'm  letting the negative views of transgendered affect my outlook, or it could it be both?

So I was in therapy yesterday and I was talking about how when I get overwhelmed or emotional I tend to lose my ability to articulate well or even know what I’m thinking anymore. My mind blanks and I feel like I cant do anything about it. While talking about this feeling I realized that what’s probably happening is my limbic system, or fight or flight response, is triggering making it so my executive function is diminished. And it gets triggered so easily because ADHD brains have difficulty regulating emotion and so it is more prone to activating the limbic system in response. But what else I put together is that Testosterone spikes also accompany cortisol spikes, and those bio chemicals ALSO interact with the limbic system. 


So I was wondering, when I start HRT would an issue like this improve tangibly? Estrogen’s accompanying biochemical is Oxytocin, which does a bunch of neat things like improve social acuity and form stronger bonds. But it also has an effect on the limbic system, but in a slightly different way. It triggers a greater fear response than what testosterone and cortisol trigger. This is because it stimulates a different sector of the limbic system. This is interesting to me because it could be replacing one problem with another, however it’s notable that this fear response is not as easily triggered as the fight or flight response in males, and being more socially aware might actually help solve some of the insecurities I do have that before had triggered my fight or flight. Something else that is interesting is that women with ADHD are under diagnosed because how it manifests in them is not as noticeable in girls. I think it may have to do with some of the brain chemistry I detailed here, though it can also be related to how their limbic systems develop different sizes to that of boys. 


There’s woefully few sources of information about how things like estrogen effect the limbic system in brains that do not naturally produce estrogen, which is frustrating since I know there are some differences.

I understand most of the jokes, but I wanted to watch the storyline progress and have something to fill my time. I'm only on season two (or three, I genuinely don't remember and I'm too lazy to look right now), but there have been two episodes about trans people so far. Both being the butt of the joke- *Haha, so funny. Tony made out with a pre-op trans girl! Hilarious, he had a guy's tongue down his throat!

Firstly, my daughter was just born and I’m engaged to a very straight woman. My fiancé is the love of my life and my best friend, but when I “just out of curiosity” asked what she would think if I were trans, she didn’t give me much to go on and changed the topic very quickly. I want to be a good husband and father, but I also might want to be a mother? I’m still very unsure.

Secondly, I live in Tennessee, where homophobia and transphobia is very common. My extended family still doesn’t know that I’m bi, and if I am trans then I’m almost positive I’d get ridiculed and ejected from the family. I am a huge family man (person) and I would hate to lose any of them. I’m also not quite sure how my parents would react as they were fine with me being bi but trans is a whole different story.

Now I’m not entirely sure that I’m trans. Some days I’m very confident in myself and I love the way I look. I keep a meticulously groomed (if sparse) beard, and sometimes I look at pictures and the mirror and truly appreciate what I have. That being said though, I wouldn’t consider myself genderqueer or bigender, as when I think about what gender I prefer it really bounces between transfem and male.

I have occasional spurts of genital dysphoria as well, so calling myself genderqueer or non-binary etc. wouldn’t really solve anything. I feel sometimes like a man and sometimes like an androgynous yet effeminate bi woman. 

I’m not really sure where to go with these feelings, and I get physically ill when I think about the idea of being trans. I’m just so scared and confused and I have no idea what to do.

Let’s get this out of the way, I’m a cishet male, and I have no idea what it’s like to be trans or even have gender dysphoria, so when it comes to trans issues, it seems you guys would know better than others.

Anyway, I’ve been hearing a lot about trans women (male to female) athletes being in traditionally gender separated sports and I wanted to get some insight on how you guys feel about the issue.

I know the argument against it is that biological males are on average stronger than biological females, therefore giving trans women an unfair advantage.

On the other hand I’ve heard that the procedures and hormone therapies make the athlete essentially on par with your average biological female athlete.

I really don’t know enough to make a clear stand on it since the logic is there for NOT letting them in but the people saying that seem like they just don’t like trans folk.

Lately I (14) came to the realization that I might be trans (FTM). I've always acted like a male, saw myself as a male, wished to be born a male etc. But there always one thing I cared the most about: I can't stand people who act to me like I'm a girl. One day, couple of years ago, my father noticed that I got really upset when someone whanted me to wear a dress, dance that kind of stuff and he started to do the exact thing I hate so much. The only way to describe the way he treat me is with a meme: you know that meme with the parent who says to his AFAB transmasc kid ""hello my feminine girl, the most beautiful girly woman on earth.""? Yeah, that my father. That's literally how he speaks to me. EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY. I've always got angry when he did it and I think he enjoyed see me in that situation because I can't do anything about it. I asked him to stop so many times and he doesn't care about it.

That was before I realized I'm trans. So now, as you might guessed, it got much worst (he doesn't do anything different but... I don't know how to explain it, it just hurts more). I literally can't hear him speak without getting extremely upset. Some times just being in the same room with him makes me want to cry. After most of our conversations I'm having a minor mental breakdown.

There isn't anything I can do about it right now and I'm afraid that when (or if) I'll come out to him he'll continue to treat me that way or something.

2021-03-03 12:33:31,lwstyq,2,7," In recent months during lockdown, I've been forced to confront the fact  that I might be trans. I'm at the point now where I'm agonising over  whether or not to start hormone therapy because it's feeling really hard  to push this stuff down anymore: I'm increasingly unmotivated in my job  and feel a lack of direction and an inability to concentrate. In some  ways I'm suspecting it comes back to not having a strong male identity.  


My story in brief:  


**Dressing up**:  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to dress up as a girl. When I was  a kid I had a dressing up box and I remember being quizzed by my  grandmother (who I lived with) because I was always dressing up a  costume as a woman. This evolved in my early teens into sneaking into my  mum's room when she was at work and trying on her underwear. I used to  keep a little box of girl's/women's clothes that I would wear whenever I  was home alone. I sometimes used to wear girl's underwear under my  school clothes. There was nothing sexual at all about it at this point.  It was just this urge which was like nothing else.  


**Looking feminine**:  As a kid I always looked extremely feminine. I remember a girl on the  school bus looking at me when I was about 14 and saying ""you're just  like a girl"". In my teens older men would often hit on me. I've always  been relatively dainty and have extremely feminine facial features. If I  shave and grow my hair a bit I can still easily pass as a woman (I'm 28  now) with barely any make-up. (P.S. Not saying that those who don't  look like me are any less trans etc. I don't believe that at all. But I  find it interesting how I look so feminine to begin with.  


**Relationships**:  In my teens and early twenties I had crushes on girls. In my twenties I  made an effort to go to the gym and started to have more success with  women (the combination of being pretty and also being a bit manly too  did wonders). However my relationships (3 relatively serious ones all  with women) all failed. I went on a promiscuous spree for about a year  and a half (I slept with around 30 women in total) but the whole thing  was quite unsatisfying (except to my ego which I was trying to pump up  with this image of a sexually successful male. I'd often have to take  viagra to get hard during intercourse. I don't really feel like I was  doing it for the sex, more for the ego boost that went with the sex.  


**Sexuality**:  Ever since I was about 17 I have been watching transsexual pornography.  But never from the perspective of the man, always from the perspective  of the trans actress. That's always who I've fantasized about being. At  times this has turned into a bit of a porn addiction. Some people might  say that what I really have is a fetish, but I was always wanting to  dress up as a girl even before I found porn. When I masturbate or think  about sex it's almost always with me as a woman and a man having  penetrative anal sex with me. I've been with 3 men but the sex was never  that good. I think because I wasn't that attracted strongly to the men,  I just wanted to try it. There is a certain type of man I am attracted  to though, and I think if I tried it with someone like that I would  enjoy it a lot more. I often use a dildo on myself and love the feeling.  I never even experienced pre-cum until I started to use that on myself.  I am still attracted to women but I am more sexually turned on by the  idea of submitting to a very manly man. I want him to penetrate me, but I  do not want to penetrate him. I haven't yet because I was brought up in  the countryside to feel shame around being gay, bi or trans etc.  However the urge is so strong and I feel like maybe I use porn to  suppress it.  


I hope all that makes sense. I think I may be  trans but I don't know. At the moment I'm letting my hair grow out (easy  anyway during lockdown), trimming my eyebrows and losing weight so that  my body looks more feminine. People around me are starting to notice  something is up.

When I first came out, I encountered some gatekeeping, within the community itself. ""You're not trans, you're non-binary."" ""You're not trans if you are still presenting as the gender you were assigned at birth."" It's the same vibe as ""you're not really gay if you're not gold-star-gay."" I don't think that's right or fair. 

It hurts. I am doing my best to give back to the community. I know there were trailblazers before me and their sacrifices allow me the luxury to do this at my own pace. It feels like I'm not allowed to be who I am or identify as trans if I am not fully transitioned. I have mostly ignored these people, but am I missing something? 

As for me still presenting as the gender I was assigned at birth, I am coming out at the pace I am comfortable with at work and with my family. I am taking baby steps, but I don't deny who I am when the topic comes up. I have been met with a lot of support because I am very selective with who I have serious conversations about this. It's my story to tell, and I am sharing it with people I trust.   


I know who I am and I don't see a reason to label myself non-binary to make people in the trans-community comfortable the same way I don't see a reason to label myself my birth-gender to make the cis-community more comfortable. Coming out is something I have put off until my 40s because I grew up so darn eager to please. I would like to simply be myself before 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Is it disrespectful to be presenting as my birth-gender in professional situations but identifying as trans? Am I not allowed to come out until I am fully transitioned?

A trans woman died yesterday in my country. She was the first coming out transgender soldier of Korea. She was unfairly kicked out of the military just because she had a gender reassignment surgery.

For the past few months, she has fought against this injustice. Many trans people in my country gained courage and hope from her actions.

But in the end, the hatred and discrimination that prevailed in our society swallowed her.

The military said it had nothing to say about the death of a civilian. But all trans people in my country know. She was murdered, and the killer is the military.

If you want, could you tell this news to many people? That would be a great help.

- First and foremost it made me very ecstatic and also kinda proud because it reminded me how far I’ve come already (been a almost a year of yearning to start).
- Part of me was paranoid since I don’t take much medication and I was worried that I might mess up the dose, but all fears subsided after taking it. (And plus the starting dose won’t really do any harm).
- I built up to taking it with the halo 3 theme cause it makes you feel like a self made badass!!! (I was actually really bad at halo, but I loved the character customisation lol).
- I’m about to take the first picture of a future time lapse of my transition (1 photo every week in the same spot). Pretty cool!!!!

(And plus the starting dose won’t really do any harm).\n- I built up to taking it with the halo 3 theme cause it makes you feel like a self made badass!!!

I come from a country with a reputation for TERFs, indeed we were the last in western Europe to not recognise trans people, until we were forced to by an ECHR judgement in 2002 that led to the GRA being passed in 2004, giving trans people legal recognition, albeit with numerous hurdles. 

I have long known both my parents, particularly my mother, to hold anti trans viewpoints that I have come to disagree with and consider unfair, as well as them lapping up propaganda from people like Glinner and shows like South Park which they treat as gospel and ignore alternative viewpoints. They seem to have a persecution complex where they act as if they are being oppressed for their views, no matter whether this is true or not. 

They imply that trans people are part of a conspiracy to strip women of their identity and that trans people are a threat to feminism.

2021-03-04 00:17:23,lx88lf,4,1,"So, considering the headline I guess y'all know where this is going. To give some background:

I identified as non-binary for a few years now but there are some feelings and thoughts that keep popping up and I don't know where to put them. Maybe they are a common thing to experience (?) but as I am not in therapy or have any knowledge to judge that, I thought I make a reddit acc and ask the people.

As far as I can remember, I was always more of a ""tomboy"" as a kid. I was wearing ""boyish"" clothes (to the point where other students bullied me for looking like a boy) and I from an very early age one didn't grasp the whole ordeal with femininity or gender (thus why I gravitated towards non-binary). Which is fine and doesnt mean I'm trans, I know. What I feel is maybe weird is that I'm not especially fond of my breasts. Like since I'm 18 years old bind my breasts down and wouldn't mind if they were gone. I was always the one in the friend group to whine about how I would love to look like Chris Evans and I trained real hard to build up some muscle (which of course never worked out, lol). I always identified only with male characters(in tv shows, etc.) and always (since I was little) wanted to be like them. I admire the male physique in the way that I actually envy it. And when I make up scenarios up in my head about life and stuff, I'm not female, I'm a man. In my friend's group I am referred to as the ""dad"" and we always make jokes about it. Even though I am out as non-binary in my friends group, people know I do like to go by male-coded nicknames or names  (lad, dude, bro, etc) but I feel really uncomfortable when someone uses female coded words like queen, or girl.

The thing that gets to me most is when people in my daily life read me as male and refer to me with male pronouns. It legit always makes me feel so giddy. I feel happy. But also kinda guilty? I cannot explain it to be honest. 

Now, to the more confusing part. I do like wearing eyeliner from time to time (I will go weeks without using makeup and then feel like I wanna wear pink eyeshadow or something) I do feel great in a flannel button up shirt and baggy jeans, but I also like more feminine clothes sometimes. It's like I'm oscillating between the two ways of dressing inherently masculine and feminine. 

I think there are about a millions other things I could mention here where I felt dysphoria and stuff, but I think this post is too long already.

I really dont know what to do, I don't know if all of these things have a simple explanation that doesnt involve me being trans and I'm just caught up in some idea. 

So, my question would be if you could tell me if you relate to this when you are ftm trans or when you are non-binary and think that might have something to do with that. Any advice would be appreciated when voiced in a constructive and kind way. Please no hate as I get that enough form my family.

If anyone answers this post: Thank y'all

The survey takes about 10 minutes to complete and can be found either at this link https://csuchico.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6y7p5AJyymKPPBH or [here](https://csuchico.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6y7p5AJyymKPPBH).

Hello! I’m Maeve Giles and I’m doing a study on transgender people. I am an undergraduate psychology student at California State University, Chico. I am a 22 mtf who is interested in the relationship between parental support and transphobia. My survey takes about 10 minutes to complete and it asks you questions about your views of yourself as a transgender person and a few questions about your family. My goal is to show my community that the effects of transphobia can be negated with lots of familial love and support from a young age. I also want to provide hope to other trans people by showing that the effects of transphobia are not permanent. Like I said, the survey takes 10 minutes and is friendly on pc Mac and mobile. When you take the survey there will be no personal information recorded. It will not ask you for a name, an email, a phone number, or any other kind of identifying information. All responses are completely anonymous and will only be seen alongside all the rest of the data by myself and my faculty advisor Emily Treat. So help a girl get into graduate school!

I enjoy the few things that I do as a guy but there all things that I can do as a girl too. I really don't fit in as a guy. My nicest friends have always been girls, and I wish that I could be one.

What I'm really having problems with though, is changing over. I don't really know where to start, and changing over (transitioning) is really scary. I've seriously wanted to change for probably 2 years and I've always ignored it until now. I just think about what it would be like to finally change all the time. I'd finally be able to act and look cute. I used to hate how I kind of looked like a girl and try to hide it but now that's something I love and really like about myself. If my hair was long and I could style it I'd look exactly like a girl. This is really what tells me I want to be a girl. I don't care about any of the stuff that I'm ""supposed to like."" Anytime I see some like a hot anime girl or something, I don't think sexually. I just think that I wish that I could look like her or I'll like her outfit or something. I got that a lot with shows like Fairy Tail.

Transitioning really scares me though. I dont want to have parts of me wasted or damaged. I wish that somehow I knew a friend who was ftm and we could exchange. Almost like out of cartoon where characters switch bodies. I mean people can give a kidney or a lung right? Why not be able to cross both ways? mtf with ftm. I'm not a doctor though so what do I know...

The idea of being the gender that I identify with is really exciting though. It'd be amazing to just live naturally instead of watching myself, making sure not to cross my legs or look at my hands a certain way, get to wear clothes that don't feel like trash bags and instead wear outfits that I love, be excited and express myself, go get the cute drinks and foods that I've always wanted to try but have said no to, and live my best life.

I just wonder if I'm ready to really look into changing. Is it just a phase like some people say or am I ready after wanting it for years now? The poll is for if I'm ready to seriously look into it. Thank you

Even before I knew, I knew.  I look back at some events that felt inignificant in the moment but they stirred something within me that I couldn't quite understand at that time. Well, now I do. I remember one day at school a couple of girls from a year above mine approached me and asked me if I would ever want to turn into a boy. The way they appraoched me felt as if they were targetting me because they weren't sure of my answer. To be honest, I wasn't either. I had never thought of it because I had never had the chance to.

I obviously answered ""No!"" because that is what i was supposed to say. But I remember walking away and having this weird winking feeling. Why did I say no? The only reason I could think of was that girls could get pregnant. But I wasnt really satisfied with that answer. I knew there was something I had stumbled upon that needed more exploring but I remember clearly thinking, ""not right now"". It took me 7 years to remember that incident and have the courage and privilege of safety to sit down and actually explore what it stirred.

Whenever I tell this story to cis people they make a comment saying, ""high school kids can be mean!""

2021-03-04 15:39:57,lxnb9m,6,2,"So, I think I might be trans? 

I do have childhood memories of me always acting male, not everyone does tho and It sometimes might mean nothing, but I have always felt better as a guy, I didn't like skirts and dresses and I had an “I hate pink phase” which funnily enough it's my favorite color now, I liked roughhousing with my other two brothers and there were other stuff I like doing that we consider more of a guy thing, I never could really try out any of those things that often or explore my gender more because my mom is a super girly girl, and she would get upset every time I do
something considers male, so besides the stereotypical behavior of a tomboy, and wanting to hang out with some guys at my school but not being allowed because I was a girl, nothing else happened.
I do remember questioning my gender before a few times but never knowing what I was feeling or why, because my mom didn't allow me to use the internet until I was 14 (thank you, mom, at least I didn't do anything embarrassing on the internet) but every time I questioned my gender I would get mad I wasn't a boy and ask why I wasn't born a boy, to summarize this I had a lot of moments that made me realize I was trans, but now the problem is that my mind is just being dumb, I was so desperate to fit in, and to be liked by my mom that I just caved to their demands. After watching a girl on tik tok rock a skirt and a crop top I wanted to do the same, I wanted to look just as pretty as her and feel pretty for once, so I bought the clothes, my mom was super happy that I started being more feminine and that encouraged me more, but when I wore my skirt, while I looked pretty I didn't felt pretty or felt like it was right, but the compliments from my parents were enough to make me disregard those thoughts, the worst was when I went out with my friends, they would compliment me a lot and that made me feel great, but later I would just feel so self-aware on my skirt and I wanted to hide and just die right there, I would subconsciously hide my feminine part and in those moments I would feel deep hatred for my feminine part.

This year has been another of those years where I questioned my gender but since I now have time to think more about it, I did, and now since I have the resources to look things up and know about the LGBT I decided to research what I was feeling, I know I'm not non-binary, or a demi girl or demiguy, the other options that I resonated to where, gender fluid, trans, or cisgender, and I know it can't be the last one and I'm super sure I'm not the former either, so I thought about this for a month, I looked videos on how to know, I looked through articles, I saw videos on people's experiences, I tried wearing sports bras that would hide my chest, I wore baggy pants, I wore sweaters and just overall tried more masculine things to see how I felt, and I felt great!, but I know that once I talk to my mom she'll try and make me change my mind and make me doubt myself even more and I don't want that to happen, the thing is idk what other reassuring methods to use, and I keep doubting myself so much because I'm a feminine guy and my mom always being one for in forcing gender roles made me think that feminine guys arent good, so that might be a reason why I'm so doubtful, idk how to get over that? Also today and yesterday I haven't felt so dysphoric, like if I think about my gender I get this pit in my stomach but not much else, idk if that's normal, if my mind is just tired of thinking about my gender for a month and a half nonstop or if I should consider the option of being gender-fluid.

After watching a girl on tik tok rock a skirt and a crop top I wanted to do the same, I wanted to look just as pretty as her and feel pretty for once, so I bought the clothes, my mom was super happy that I started being more feminine and that encouraged me more, but when I wore my skirt, while I looked pretty I didn't felt pretty or felt like it was right, but the compliments from my parents were enough to make me disregard those thoughts, the worst was when I went out with my friends, they would compliment me a lot and that made me feel great, but later I would just feel so self-aware on my skirt and I wanted to hide and just die right there, I would subconsciously hide my feminine part and in those moments I would feel deep hatred for my feminine part.\nI have also gone by a few male names online and have felt great when being referred to as a guy.

Hi, I'm transfem, and I've been thinking about tucking recently, but whenever I do it sounds scary. 

I tried once in the past and it just made me feel weird as I was trying to tuck away the testes. The thought of it made me shudder.

Then I was sort of trying to last night. I was lying in bed and I figured I'd try and find the inguinal canals. I was trying to push down my testes, but then as they got deep I just felt my whole body shudder in discomfort and I, almost involuntarily, twisted my body in disgust (sort of like a tic), and I felt horrified. Then the testicle I tried moving was hurting a tiny bit, but it felt more like a psychological pain, like I was just mentally uncomfortable with it.

That's a big reason why I was scared to come out to my mom.

Maybe I should've had more faith in her :-)

2021-03-04 20:14:55,lxu26x,0,4,"Hello!! I (23) am non-binary and have found out my insurance will cover top surgery which is very exciting since I have a lot of dysphoria around my chest. I’ve been working on the process with my therapist and it’s going very well so far. I’m really struggling with how to tell my mom. We are really close and usually she’s super supportive and caring which I really appreciate and she was great about me coming out as a lesbian so I assumed she would be accepting of anything but last year I mentioned wanting top surgery and her immediate reaction was to say “if you get top surgery I’d kill myself” which was obviously really traumatizing and upsetting to hear. 

I know she was exaggerating and didn’t mean it literally but the fact that the idea upset her enough that she could say something like that even as hyperbole was really shocking to me and made me feel unsafe talking to her about my gender identity. I told her how upsetting this reaction was and asked her to go to therapy to deal with her issues on the topic. She apologized but said she doesn’t need therapy. 

She has been so supportive in so many ways and aside from the topic of gender is such an amazing mother to me. She will always help me when I ask for help with money or life generally and I know she wants me to be happy but I just don’t know how to tell her I’m going through with this because if she has a bad reaction it will be devastating for me. 

I initially wanted to just not tell her until the last minute so she would just have to deal with it since I’m an adult but the more I think about the actual surgery the more I feel like I would want her there to help me recover since she has been my main source of support, especially emotionally, my whole life. Having her take care of me while I go through something that is scary (I’ve never had surgery) is so appealing and makes the idea less intimidating, but I just don’t feel sure I can trust her to be supportive in this situation and don’t know how to navigate that. 

If anyone has any advice on talking to parents (especially ones who are well meaning but ignorant about trans/gender issues) about surgery or gender in general I would super appreciate it!!!

I don’t want to upset her but I also know this is the right choice for me and since it is my body I get to make that choice.

2021-03-04 20:41:41,lxuqn8,0,1,"First up, I am 20 y/o MTF. Started thinking i might be trans beginning last year, been on waitlist for therapy which can lead to hormones since june.

So i bought some more feminine clothes. 2 skirts, some more panties(the ultra cheap ones i bought to experiment with are quite literally falling appart :\^) ), and 2 tops. A cute grey T-shirt with a penguin on it, and a black hoodie with a stylized white cat face on it. I like how they all look, individually. I tried them on since i got them today. And I have been wearing the t-shirt with one of the skirts. It's clothes i've always *wanted* to get, and now that i live alone i can. But... wearing these i feel more fake than ever. My hair has been growing more feminine and i love it. I put mascara on my face and i love how feminine it makes me see my face. Yet these clothes make me feel fake.

I think i might know why. I think its because for the last 10 years of my life i have worn a black t-shirt, a hoodie(usually black), and some form of comfy pants. When i go out, which is almost never now but before rona only to things like school tbh, i switched my comfy pants for jeans and thats it. Its mostly all black because i always disliked how i look and black helps mask that. I think its basically an ""armor"" of some sorts. These clothes i got now are a lot cuter, more colourful, etc. But they also show off the top half of my body. Show the undeniably masculine shape. I think those two elements, the wearing something different from my usual... ""armor"", and the fact these show of my masculine features atm, make it so that i feel... fake.

I am trying to rationalize it as such. But feeling fake leads me to feeling like i am not trans, which leads me to thinking everything i thought about thusfar is wrong and i am not really trans and despite always having wanted to be a woman i'm wrong etc etc. And... i'm honestly not sure which of the two sides is right. Maybe i just need a style more akin to my... ""armor"". Maybe i need to somehow work on self acceptance because of internalized transphobia. Maybe i will just get more and more depressed till i am finally off of this godforsaken waitlist. I dont know.

2021-03-04 20:59:22,lxv94e,18,5,"Hello I am a 29 year old cis gender woman with a 12 year old daughter (AMAB) I'm looking for a trans persons perspective on this issue and would appreciate any feed back. 

I considered posting this in r/parenting but figured I'd get more valuable responses here. If this isn't the place for this kind of post I will gladly take it down. 

For context, my daughter told me she was a girl when she was 7. Ever since her birth, I never placed much value on typical gender roles and let her play with whatever toys she wanted and wear clothes that she felt comfortable in. Since she told me this, I asked her if she would like me to refer to her with she / her pronouns to which she said yes. 

Yesterday she asked me if she could start taking hormone blockers. I am not outwardly opposed to this, but I am not sure about the long-term effects it will have on her. I'm also not sure if 12 is a good age to start taking it. 

I've been doing a fair amount of research into the trans community as it is not something I have much personal experience with, but there's still a lot I don't know specifically about hormone replacement therapy. 

I have not yet taken her to a gender therapist, and maybe I'm just paranoid, but I am afraid they will invalidate her in some way. I have always encouraged her to express herself freely and would rather not have some doctor tell her she's making it up or something like that. 

But I do understand that I'm nowhere near a professional on this topic and she probably needs help that I can't provide. 

We live in a somewhat rural area and this morning I looked up endocrinologists in the area. There were only 2 results, both with very low ratings. I would be willing to take her somewhere with more options for this kind of care if you think that's the right move. 

So my questions are 1. Are there any unwanted side effects to puberty blockers? 2. Do you think she might feel invalidated by a gender therapist? 3. Should I take her to a bigger city (NYC is a 2 hour drive away) for this type of care? 4.) Might be a dumb question but what form do puberty blockers come in? (Pills, shots, etc)

2021-03-04 21:55:57,lxwi09,3,5,"So, I'm writing this in a throwaway because I don't want this connected to my main. I'm an afab non binary and currently contemplating the possibility of microdosing T until I get to the desired ambiguity and then going off it. One of the things I'm not sure about what my feelings are is bottom growth, the idea of which I really like. (I know you can't pick and choose etc etc, but I'll stil have to think about all parts separately hence this post). Two main problems come into this:

1) I have seen a lot of porn featuring people with bottom growth, and basically, I don't know if I'm just sexually attracted to such a feature (and into that comes also the issue that this might be sexualising people's bodies, which I am aware of, but I also don't know how to fix that) or that I want a T dick myself. I find it hard (hah) to talk about, because I'm aware of the possibility that I might only be sexualising something, and that feels very wrong. But I feel like I would also be really happy about having a T dick myself. But also, maybe I only like the idea sexually, and not in general? I'm not really sure about that? Like, the idea of having a T dick turns me on, but is that a valid reason for wanting one? How do I see this disconnected from sexuality? Should I even see it disconnected from that? It's also not like I ever think about what's currently there in a context that's not sexual, so maybe that is a valid reason?

2) if I desire bottom growth, but don't desire having a cis male penis, is that even bottom dysphoria at all? I mean, I'm not uncomfortable with how things are right now... I just really love that I now recognise how my current part also gets hard like an erection, but I'd like it to be less tiny basically?

Alright so, I’m in a situation that makes me feel worse everyday. Firstly, I’ve been thinking about being a girl for around 2 years, I’m 14 now and puberty hit me pretty hard so far. 

It’s pretty clear to me I want more time to think about this because I keep growing and everything else that comes with male puberty keeps coming. I have the feeling that it wouldn’t be worth it to be trans because I wouldn’t get the experiences a cis women would have. 

I’ve told my mom I was “questioning” and she said give it time to wait and see, I really don’t know what I want and I don’t want it to get too late. Ex. Male puberty.

I don’t know how people would accept me because I’m almost certain my friend group of cis boys wouldn’t accept me, and they’re my only friends.

I’ve heard puberty blockers can have long term effects if I decide I don’t want to transition. I don’t know if things like staying inside for 10 months due to covid are making me feel this way.

On the bright side I have an outlet of my feminine nature online, I changed my usernames and avatar on different video games. I also get gendered correctly online.

I know that it is my personal responsibility to educate myself, but I also feel like I am at the point where I need to have a conversation with a person who has personally experienced being transgender because the questions all go together and change as I’m learning.

1.) it's 5AM and I'm not sleeping well, so I apologise if this is worded poorly.

2.) I'm closeted, age 16, living with my mother and brother.

Now into the meat of the post:

So, I'm a trans girl, and id like to come out soon. I've been dealing with a lot of dysphoria recently, especially around my voice and chest, and it's something I want to begin working on posthaste.

The issue is, I physically can't bring myself to say the words ""Mum, I'm trans."" I'm a very quiet person when it comes to stuff like this, I get all of my important conversations done over text, it's how I told all my friends. I think the issue is that, when I think about saying it, I can hear my gross teenage boy voice saying it instead of something pleasant.

Furthermore, even though Ive been dealing with really bad dysohria during most of my waking hours, even from just touching my chest, I only really think ""I need to come out"" at night, when eveyone is asleep. I think I'm too busy with projects, games and schoolwork to worry about the implications of dysphoria in the day, and it all piles up. Has anyone dealt with anything similar? Does anyone have any advice?

I've been out to my friends since I was 14, and I've frequently told myself ""I'm going to come out at X date"" and I just never do. It's starting to make me think I'm fraudulent, like the reason I can't come out is because Im just not trans, so I don't want to?

Anyway, happy to answer any questions if it means yall can give me a hand here. Just some words of advice, or just how you came out to your parent, might be really helpful. Thanks in advance.

Flash forward to 2021, my boyfriend and I were talking about his sexuality. I identify to most people as a gay boy, because I’m scared to say anything, and generally I don’t think I’m ready to. My boyfriend identified up until this point as a bisexual man, but he confessed to me that he’s now unsure about how he feels about his attraction to women. He says that he’s definitely attracted to men (and me), but he goes back and forth with his attraction to women. 

During our conversation I told him I questioned my gender, and that I was pretty certain I was just in my head. He reacted well when I mentioned this to him, and didn’t really have much to say. Since that conversation I’ve realized that I’m definitely not confused and I need to tell him.

Some important information to bring to attention is that I’m currently 18, my boyfriend is 32. He’s very comfortable with trans people and he’s very fond of my brother, who is trans. My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and we’re very communicative when it comes to serious/important things.

I think the main thing I am worried about is just confusing him, as he’s trying to figure out his bisexuality.

I was born on 5 July 1995 and assigned male. I knew from early childhood that something wasn't quite right. I was never comfortable in my own skin, I was always too odd to fit in with other kids I was supposed to be getting along with, etc. 

Around 8th grade, I finally understood something about myself: I was a girl. Awesome, right? I could explore that realization and finally be happy with myself. Well, it wasn't that simple. I grew up in a backwards, hateful Central Indiana town. I was bullied relentlessly after word got out that I was bisexual. Imagine if they found out I was trans! 

So I hid that fact. I grew a big old beard as soon as I could and acted as masculine as possible. This meant letting my voice go as deep as it could without sounding derpy and liking mainly manly shit, like guns and motorbikes. This all probably sounds silly, but I was *terrified* of anyone learning the truth. I never even told my family.

I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't handle lying to myself like that. I recently shaved the foot and a half long beard that acted as my shield. I'm 25 years old now, and I'm finally starting to come out. I've told my sister, and a lot of my close friends. Thankfully, everyone I've told has been very supportive and loving.

I even got a whole new Reddit account, ditched the one I had for years, another way of distancing myself from the male persona I'd built up.

I have to admit, I have the trans community as a whole to thank for inspiring the courage this required.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. 
The gender dysphoria is becoming unbearable.
I, 14 AMAB, recently discovered that I am not cis. Now that I have accepted that, my dysphoria has gotten worse. I can't say my own name anymore, saying my (current) pronouns makes me sick, I am actively angry at my genitals, I never take off my shirt for any reason other than changing it and showering, and every time I look in a mirror I can only see the super-masculine parts of my face. The problem though is that NONE of these things tell me what gender I am, only that I am not cis. I don't feel like I can come out until I am sure either. Genderqueer just does not fit me, I want something more specific. Even though my parents would be supportive, I just can't bring myself to come out until I am sure of something. But I won't be sure of anything until I come out. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. I even have proof my parents would be supportive because I have a nb sibling that they are very accepting of. I also could very easily co.e out to my friend group because there are multiple people that are LGBTQ+. But it is the same problem. I don't feel comfortable coming out until I'm sure. Coming out feels like putting tape down. I can prepare all I want, but once it is down I cant move it. And I know that's bullshit. But coming out feels like I am definitely saying something, so I am not comfortable with anything until I am definite.

2021-03-08 00:12:27,m03a60,3,0,"Im so confused,  


I had a wierd, long way to accept myself as trans, I spare you the details,  
but Im closed to my family and even most of my friends and sometimes im still not sure if Im Trans or not.  
Even if, I know that Im not transsexual (so I dont want any surgery or hormones | pleas dont ask why, thats shouldnt be the focus)  
This makes it even harder for me to figuer out where I stand.  


Tonight (yea, Im from europ) I had a breakdown once again and I dont know how to handle it.  
I had a Videocall with my friends and I drunk a bit (not alot, just 2 strong beers) but still enough to take me to that wierd objectively-thinking status (I dont know if that matters).  
After a time, every of us invited friends so we were able to make a bigger party in a game.  
One of the friends of my friend was Trans female, pre sugery and she hasnt had alot of transition yet.  
Anyhow it made me feel uncomfortable, I dont mean that she was her,  
but she made me think about any transition I want to go though.   
Online there is no problem for me to tell anyone that Im trans and I want to get handled as female, but I cant imagine to say this to anyone I alreaddy know for a time.  
Im scared to get traided different by them, but Im scared aswell to keep get traided like I do, aswell.  


Todays morning, I could have explained what I want to change (and theres alot)  
but now, Im not sure if I want any of these, because Im scared to change it,  
I want to get traided right, as the gender I have, but I also dont want to get traided different, like in a bad way. Im still the same person.  


And I ask myself, am I trans? Or does that scare about changing any mean that im not?  
Im so confused, I was close to crying just out of confusion a minute ago and I still dont know what to think and how to think about me and my future.

If the trans community could have come across as a group of respectable, normal men and women who simply want better understanding of our medical condition and access to the appropriate routes of treatment (transitioning), then we would have achieved full acceptance by now. Instead, we failed to separate ourselves adequately from those who only seek to appropriate our condition for their own purposes. I'm talking about the otherkin, neopronoun users, MOGAI, people like ""Jessica"" Yaniv, and other weirdos who tried to get under the trans umbrella and were allowed to come in and wreak havoc on our community and as a result, portray all transgender people as fetishists, as predators, as general weirdos.

And now that we are about to reap what we have sowed, I don't want to hear any of the ""tucutes"" or the ""non-dysphorics"" complain when transitioning is fully banned for everyone. After all, all the work they've done to ""demedicalize"" transsexualism is finally reaching its natural end game. If you don't need dysphoria to be trans, and if you don't need HRT to be trans, and if you don't need surgery to be trans, and if you identify as a woman but have a full beard shadow which you've done nothing to alleviate and still use the women's bathroom, then what's the point of transitioning right? So don't complain when transitioning is banned for everyone.

Folx, I'm struggling. 

I'll try to make this as concise as I can. SO, I'm finally leaving my abusive situation after many years. I'm happy, but at the same time, dreading it

because while I'll be finally free of my abuser, I'll also be leaving behind what I have come to think of as support (but probably isn't really)

from this same abuser. They are literally the only person I associate with outside of doctors/ therapists. Because my abuser did a great job of isolating me and keeping me dependent on them, I'm very ignorant about well...life. I feel like I'm basically an 18 year old just going 

out into the world for the first time, despite being much older than that. I know that I can't do this by myself. I need help. The only other familiar human 

I associate with and have even an inkling of relative trust, is my dad. We're not especially close, but we 

talk on the phone a few times a year and see each other every few years--despite living in the same town. The problem is, my dad doesn't know I'm trans. In the past he has 

said things that have indicated that he's not supportive of trans people. I suppose it would be simple enough to just not tell him, but I recently 

decided that I'd like to start T. If he decides to disown me or whatever, then I have no one. I am also not totally sure that my dad

wouldn't tell my abuser, that I am planning to leave, which would make my life even more of a living hell and the threat of which adds to my overall distress over the situation. 

So...You see my dilemma. I'm sitting here crying my eyes out because I have no idea what to do. 

Should I follow my heart and go everything in my life alone or should I continue to hide myself? I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have NO ONE else. I haven't had friends for years and no other family I have relationships with. I'm high-strung, not a people person, socially anxious, oh yeah and recovering from a lifetime of abuse. 

It's very hard for me to make friends. I'm just so lost. What should I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, I forgot to mention that my dad is really susceptible to the influence of others--particularly my step-mom and his in-laws. It's not unheard of for him to tell me his opinion about something on the spot, then come back the next day and have completely done a 180 and changed his mind, saying things in a way that lets me know that ""his opinion"" is not coming from him.

SO, I\'m finally leaving my abusive situation after many years. I\'m happy, but at the same time, dreading it\n\nbecause while I\'ll be finally free of my abuser, I\'ll also be leaving behind what I have come to think of as support (but probably isn\'t really)\n\nfrom this same abuser. They are literally the only person I associate with outside of doctors/ therapists. Because my abuser did a great job of isolating me and keeping me dependent on them, I\'m very ignorant about well...life. I feel like I\'m basically an 18 year old just going \n\nout into the world for the first time, despite being much older than that. I know that I can\'t do this by myself. I need help. The only other familiar human \n\nI associate with and have even an inkling of relative trust, is my dad. We\'re not especially close, but we \n\ntalk on the phone a few times a year and see each other every few years--despite living in the same town. The problem is, my dad doesn\'t know I\'m trans. In the past he has \n\nsaid things that have indicated that he\'s not supportive of trans people. I suppose it would be simple enough to just not tell him, but I recently \n\ndecided that I\'d like to start T. If he decides to disown me or whatever, then I have no one. I am also not totally sure that my dad\n\nwouldn\'t tell my abuser, that I am planning to leave, which would make my life even more of a living hell and the threat of which adds to my overall distress over the situation. \n\nSo...You see my dilemma. I\'m sitting here crying my eyes out because I have no idea what to do. \n\nShould I follow my heart and go everything in my life alone or should I continue to hide myself? I\'m not exaggerating when I say that I have NO ONE else. I haven\'t had friends for years and no other family I have relationships with.

Feb 1 I had GRS, and this was my first ever surgery. Like ever.  But I'm normally like fairly independent and active and it's now been over a month and I'm still not allowed to be at all. Due to some bleeding complications I'm still in restricted movement for a few more weeks, so even though I'm home I can't do much by myself. I'm limited to 500 steps a day and using my stairs once. Meaning I can go down once and when I go up that's it. 

Now my friends and surrogate family have been doing an amazing job helping. Like going grocery shopping, laundry, making food etc. But I'm just feeling super stuck and helpless. With all of that. 

Now add that to the 3x a day dilation schedule at 30 minutes a piece, and fear of complications still I've got a lot on my mind. Like every time something feels different I feel like ""oh god did I mess up?"" Or today during dilation I started shivering really bad.

I have been wondering latley why it is considered Transphobic if I (heterosexual male) wouldnt want to date a Transwoman for example. Generally Im very supportive and dont mind showing my acceptance by using their preferred pronouns and Names, basically treating them as what they identify as. 

But when it comes to feeling sexually attracted to someone, its not really something I can choose to be. In most cases I believe you can tell someone is Trans by their looks and mostly I dont find masculine carateristics sexually attractive. 

To me it‘s not the fact that its not a „real woman“  because when it comes to gender I believe the Identity is mostly more important than the biological gender (obviously there are exceptions like competitive sports). The thing that turns me personally off are the masculine traits. 

In my personal experience most transwoman still have notable masculine features so I really cant find her as attractive as a biological woman.

So I would like to know how People feel about this and if you would consider me transphobic or would see it as a preferance?

Hello my trans sisters brothers and siblings! My name is Maeve Giles and I’m a 22 MTF who is doing an honors study on transphobia and parental support. The goal of my study is to show my community that it is beneficial to embrace children’s gender identities and to let them explore freely. I also want to show that the harmful effects of transphobia do not last forever. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and will ask you questions about when you came out (if at all), your family, and your perceptions of yourself and others. This is completely voluntary and you may opt out at any point after starting. I do not collect any identifying information, so no name, username, email, phone number, IP address, or any other information about you is recorded. Your answers are seen only by myself, my faculty mentor , and my honors professor as an advisor. I’m doing this in hopes that it will help get me into the graduate program I want to get into, so help a girl out and take this survey really quick.

2021-03-09 03:03:10,m0x83p,4,1,"Could I get some gender help please? Idk what’s going on anymore. 

So I would describe myself as a transmasc enby. Leaning more towards the masculine a bit, but mostly staying in androgynous territory and being ehh about masculine terms to refer to a person and all that jazz. 

But sometimes, occasionally, things change. And idk why. 

My body dysphoria doesn’t change, my pronouns never change, what words I’m comfortable with being referred to as don’t change, etc.

The only thing that changes is my presentation desires to become a bit more feminine (while still staying androgynous) sometimes, which is kinda weird to experience as an afab enby with bad dysphoria 24/7. 

I’m not talking like frilly pink dresses or shit like that, but androgynous clothing that leans a bit more feminine, occasionally thinking about longer fake nails, shoulder length hair (well I mean I always want that, but a bit more?? If that makes sense??), etc. 

At first I thought “wait am I like genderfluid or something” but I believe that theory has been proven false? Because I have tried out different gender labels for myself, both when I’m feeling this way and when I’m not, but the only thing that ever feels right is non-binary.

My gender always feels the same, my pronouns and name are the same, my body dysphoria is the same, all that. I think if it were a gender thing, that wouldn’t be the case?

She says that she won't tell her parents unless she has to, I reassure her that she never has to unless she is comfortable with it (she doesn't owe them anything), she said she might have to and I said that until then, if she's not ready then she doesn't have to.

I also said to try not to let her brain make her doubt and make her feel rubbish (she was having doubts she was actually cis despite wanting to be a girl and wanting to identify as a girl and transition when she can)

I then said she should push the doubt as far back was possible so she can be happy and she said she wants to.

She was feeling very dysphoric and didn't actually know you could get surgery if she wanted to, I told her that she could and showed her some people who have had it and have spoken about it. I also told her that hrt would get rid of all the things she's dysphoric about. In no way am I forcing her to take hrt, she wanted to take it and Im just trying to reassure her as best as i can.

Ive been really beating myself up recently, i've meant to come out to the therapist for over a month now.

My voice has deepened but not matured, I still have no facial hair, I'm 5 7, I have small hands, I wear a size 10 womens.. my point is I need to start hormones NOW before those things change.

2021-03-09 14:46:42,m17v9e,22,1,"Last night I did eye make up with my GF, it’s only the second time I’ve done my own.
I was quite pleased with the make up but the unfortunate side effect is the more I try to treat my dysphoria with a bandaid the more like a hydras head it becomes.  

All I see is makeup on top of stubble, heavy brow, short gross hair, gross hairline... this gives me a response I can only liken to unexpectedly witnessing gore.  
I’m so sick of my ugly horrible face peering back at me. 

Still, I was quite pleased with the actual eye makeup.   
I put a picture of just the eyes on makeup lounge for any pointers and no one said anything horrible, but I got no responses and have actually been downvoted for posting.  The robot that said thanks for posting has two upvotes.  I’d laugh if I wasn’t feeling so gross about myself. 

I keep trying to tell myself this is good, I’m just practicing makeup so that when the other elements of my transition are in place I will already be competent at this.
But the hideous image of my face won’t go away, and clearly other people see it even if it’s just the eyes.  I go through the act of putting make up on, treating myself, trying to make myself look and feel right and it starts to feel that way, knowing it’s there, the taste and smell and overall feel of doing makeup and feeling pretty is great until I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, my skin tightens up like shock.  And any euphoria comes tumbling back down.  

I dust myself off and try again the next day. 

But fucking hell it’s hard, I’m glad to finally be facing my dysphoria, it’s about bloody time I did.  But it’s kicking my ass daily and it feels like no matter what I do there’s no escape.

When I came out, I took the name Alex; it was easy to remember, convenient, and a simple enough name. I know, I know, it's a go-to for a lot of trans folks, particularly trans men. That's not really my problem with it.

It's neutral. I loved it for the first 8 months, but after moving in withy boyfriend, and hearing it constantly rather than once in a blue moon when my grandmother remembered, (TBI when she was a kid, not her fault at all and not out of malice, she just forgets.) I realized it's not for me. Looking back, I think I picked it out of a need to be more androgynous for my own safety, rather than because I thought it fit. Sure, once in a while, someone will call me Xander, but even that nickname feels incorrect.

I have an appointment with the local LGBT center on the 19th to begin the process of legally changing my name. (Fully funded by them, btw, which is mind blowing.) I have a name that I think I love, that's masculine and fits me, and makes me feel good about myself when others use it.

If I could choose from my birth which gender I wanted I would choose girl without a doubt.  I have never really identified myself as a boy nor do I think I am non binary after all.  But is such a transition worth it?  Isn’t not too late for 18 years and I will one day be able to feel like a real woman?\n\nReally struggling here.

2021-03-09 23:54:52,m1jzzf,0,1,"For anyone curious about changing their name I hope this is somewhat useful, keep in mind the process can vary depending on location. This is the process I went through to give you an idea of what the process may look like.

First, I went to the probate court website of my county and searched for name change forms. The website had an instruction form for adults and also a packet that I had to fill out. The form had to be typed other than where I had to initial and and sign. 

Common areas on the form

For the request reason I put ""This is my preferred name and I want to obtain proper identification""

There was also a ""Notice of Hearing On Change of Name"" area, I didn't fill this out since I have no one I need to notify (*Not sure who this might include, maybe married folks*.)

When I filled this form out wrong it was mailed back to me in 3-10 days with a paper saying what I need to fix, I wasn't able to call them as they wouldn't give me any ""legal"" advice. 

Although the form was fairly simple I was still having trouble so I found a free LGBTQ+ Legal clinic near me. (*Might be worth looking into for some of you if you have questions*) I had a phone call with a lawyer for maybe 20 minutes and I was set.

Once I submitted the correctly filled out application with a $100 check to the probate court in my area (*I found this where they do the marriage licenses*) I finally received an email and phone call with the hearing date and the certified and filed application forms.

In my area you have to submit a publication in a newspaper 30 days prior to your hearing date (*They say this is to prevent fraud*) Instructions to do this were included in the email I received about my hearing date. I made sure to do this ASAP.

I submitted the certified and filed application forms, and a small summary of the details by email and then made a payment over the phone of around $45.

After doing this I received a ""Proof of Publication form""

My hearing was then moved to be online due to COVID. I was instructed to send my ID, Birth Certificate, Certified and filed application forms, and proof of publication to an email prior to the hearing (Otherwise I would have brought these forms with me to probate court)

Once I was at the hearing I was asked if I was a felon and some other questions regarding that (*In my area you can not change your name if you are a felon*) I was then asked why I want to change my name again I said ""This is my preferred name and to update my identification to reflect that""

They didn't ask me anything trans related, and the hearing was a really easy process. (*The name change clinic I consulted told me that if they start asking questions and you're uncomfortable or you feel it will be rejected for some reason, then ask for a ""continuance"" my understanding is this essentially puts a pause on the hearing so you can come back at a later date with legal representation but I could be wrong*)

I made sure to request plenty of Certified Judgement Entry forms (*6-10*) This is the form I used to change my name EVERYWHERE else. You can't use copies typically.  
Here's a list of places you might want to change your name after  
BMV (*ID+Voter Registration*)  
Office of Vital Statistics (*Birth Certificate, They told me to mail a certified copy)* School  
Social Security (*Social, Offices are closed for COVID since 2020, I'm mailing mine.*)  
Bank or financial institutions (*Don't forget to get updated checks*)  
Loans  
Insurance's  
Emails  
Phone provider  
Employer  
Concealed carry  
Pharmacy  
Certifications/Licensure  
Post office  
Library  
Gym

&amp;#x200B;

* You don't need to come out all at once; you can drop hints and try to figure out how comfortable your family/friends are with the idea
* if you want to test out a name before deciding on anything, I recommend ordering a coffee somewhere. This can be a huge source of euphoria, and nobody needs to know.
* Remember, you are valid.
* When you come out, it's better to do it in a public place like a park when it's just you and the person you want to come out to since it keeps you somewhat protected if they decide to lash out
* if someone tries to tell you you aren't trans or aren't valid, or you doubt yourself, just take your time. You don't need to know the answers right away, but remember that only you have lived as you and know who you are.
* If you need someone to talk to, there are many people out there you can talk to! It's not easy to come out, so find what makes you comfortable!

2021-03-10 04:25:57,m1pa61,1,1,"hi guys

apologies if this post is rambling and whiney but I just wanted to get things off my chest/get some advice.

last week I turned 23 and im fucking panicking. I’ve known I’m a trans woman for a long time now. I’ve always known something was off in my life, but I started properly putting the pieces together around 7 years ago. I got to a point in my life where I came very close to properly getting the ball rolling in terms of transitioning, but something scared me away and I buried how I felt for a long time. I regret this immensely.

I’m now in a similar position to where I was before, but due to circumstances out of my control, there’s no way I can start transitioning until I’m at least 24 (and that’s if I’m lucky). transitioning is obviously something that can be done at every age, but the older I get, the more of an uphill battle I feel it will be to pass. I was lucky enough to be born with a relatively feminine face (I like to think it was gods compromise for me) so I feel I have leeway in some respects, but I’m terrified of further ageing into a body I don’t feel comfortable with. I’m worried I’ll hit my late twenties and -  in my eyes - be stuck in an overly masculine body and unable to do a thing about it. 

I have nothing but respect and admiration for people that can be openly and proudly trans, but that’s not me. I’m not proud, often I feel deeply ashamed. all I want to do is be able to slip into a crowd and be unnoticed, but I’m worried I’ve already missed the boat. I lie awake at night wishing I hadn’t backed off before, every year flies by and I feel like my life slipping through my fingers and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared of looking in the mirror one day and feeling like I’m at the point of no return, and I’m worried that day is coming sooner rather than later.

not entirely sure what I’m asking here tbh, mainly reassurance but I don’t want to be babied.

2021-03-10 07:37:52,m1s8ew,2,1,"Preface info- I've worked with several trans people. Some I've had a hard time using their correct pronouns because their presentation did not mesh with my unconscious schema of gender. I.e. they identified male and I made every effort to use their pronouns but I often misspoke and used female wording on mistake. I corrected myself when I could without making the situation worse.

My question is about a new coworker. I have worked several days with them having no thought that they are trans and using he/him. Not once did I consider they are trans or had other pronouns. 100% I thought male. Today I accidently received info that they are trans and they may have felt or been outed by it. Basically their legal name is still their born (female) name and no one  knew. So when their paycheck arrived with the female name we questioned who it was in front of the individual. I.e. (fake bame) ""Susan? Who is Susan?"" He did not speak up at that moment and after got his paycheck. I feel like the person handing out paychecks might have needed to get a heads up but idk how that works in terms of HR and such.

So, me, wanting to make sure I was using their correct wording I looked them up in FB with their current name - which I have always known as a very male name - and they had all female pronouns along with the new name. My impression is that they just never changed the pronouns and abandoned FB after changing their names.

So now I'm not sure if I should continue with male pronouns since before this new info that they are trans, I just went with he/him. Or try to switch to they. Or maybe they are still she as their FB says. An important note - we work in an environment where we often encounter gender neutral/ambiguous names and parents get really upset when we are unsure of gender and use they/them. We end up using their names instead of the pronouns but the parents get odd about it when you over use their name.

I'm (22M) French and my girlfriend is turning 25 and Swedish. She's been looking to start feminizing HRT for years, but the specialized teams in the gender clinic that are apparently in charge of diagnosis and care for transgender people are full where she lives and she's been oriented to Stockholm but even then has no guarantee of receiving a positive answer anytime soon.

I don't know much about the Swedish system, I know more about the French system, having experienced that. I know in France we have a few databases for keeping track of trans-friendly doctors and other health professionals as well as really transphobic ones to avoid. Is there anything similar for Sweden?

She is looking to start DIYing HRT because of that, and therefore she'd want to see a doctor to be prescribed bloodwork so she can do that safely. While I'm not super on board with DIYing it, I can understand why and I'd rather she could do that safely.

Here in France you don't have to see specialized teams in clinics and you can see health professionals privately one by one. Is this also a thing that can be done? If she found a psychiatrist that understands how trans people ""work"" and consulted them in private (for lack of a better word, I'm sorry), could they refer her to an endocrinologist who could then get her started on HRT in private, and so on?

2021-03-10 10:10:09,m1ubkb,0,1,"Hello people, that going to be kind of a rant.

I (25) am kind of feeling in a really weird position at the moment about transitioning. Tl;dr at the end.

A little of context first.

Two years ago, I decided to start transitionning and ever since I've been sure of my choice. Apart a few close friends, I did not told to anyone. After a year and a half of medical stuff, I got my treatment and started it a month ago. Needless to say, I was estatic! I started to get more girl clothes and make-up and felt so freaking great about it!

Around September of last year, I started to tell my family. At first, I had a lot of supportive people : brother, sisters and grand-mother. But in December, I told my father that kind of went ballistic. That guy even said me while looking me in the eyes : ""Take that treatment, and you'll be commiting suicide by 30."" - Everything went downhill after that on the familty side, and any support I had just vanished. Most of my family took his side apart my grand-mother under the ""We are worry for you"" excuse... Well, no one was worry for me years ago when I was in a really, reallt bad place. So... Yeah, needless to say, family reunions for the past weeks haven't felt great.

Most of my father's concerns boils down to medical stuff - example, I'm asthmatic and HRT is known to make it acute in MtF - but also on the social one. I have been blessed with the usual ""It's only a phase"", ""No one ever suspected a thing"" and so on. I've never really paid attention to what he said or thought of, but all of this made me mad.

The big problem is that some of his concerns have crawled in my mind and have been creeping my thoughts ever since. So many what-ifs.

- What if it's only an elaborate lie I've been telling myself for years?
- What if this treatment just fucks my health up to the ground ? I've felt short breathed a few times in the lasy month. Is it foresighting something worse?
- What if I'm locked into some kind of limbo between a male and female appareance? 

I've not tried any make-up for a month and a half, I'm feeling weird in my woman clothes where I used to wear then proudly. I'm starting to be afraid of taking my pills and taking the next appointments like voice coaching. Hell, I'm even back to the point where I hide all mirrors from my flat to not see my reflection. I can still see the girl inside, but she feels so far away right now.

What's driving me nuts about all of that is simply that I'm doubting myself so much. I'm usually confident in my choices. I know transitionning is not all birds and sunlight. All the drawbacks of transitioning are outweight by far by the benefices. But... Damn it, is it too much to ask to just feel good in my body once in my life time?

I don't really want to ressent my family. Hell, I'm trying to show them I'm listening to their concerns. They tell me they feel they are talking to a wall. So am I.

So... Aside from by huge rant, I wanted to know if some people here have been in similar situations. If yes, how did you handle it? Any advice or story would be most welcome.

Now, I feel like everything about my presentation just screams harassment target.\n\nI can’t keep wearing jeans and coats all summer, and I’d definitely prefer to feel cute if possible, but I’d also like to stay alive. Any suggestions for how to balance these two?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Help please: How to go out in new clothes in a conservative area?', 'created': 1615436257.0}"

Hello all! My name is Maeve Giles and I’m a 22 MtF college student who is doing an honors thesis on parental support and transphobia. My goal is to show my community that it’s better to let children explore their gender identities freely. I’m also trying to show that the harmful effects of transphobia are not permanent. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes and will ask you questions about your perceptions of yourself and others as well as a few questions about your family. All answers are completely anonymous and there is no identifying information recorded. No names, phone numbers, emails, phone numbers, usernames, passwords, pins, or anything! This is fully voluntary and you may drop out at any point. I’m doing this to get into the graduate program I want and I need as many participants with thorough answers as possible.

**One day, we get to the point where all the time, energy, effort, sweat, tears, blood &amp; our entire soul is seen by the Universe and given to us 100 fold. Until that day, keep pushing, keep going, its all worth it.**

The times we are going through can be difficult sometimes to find the energy to push through the day, to complete tasks and projects that have been created by us but then become a responsibility. Something that helps me is knowing when I am feeling tired and wanting to give up, **I take a step back. To reset. I go outside and breathe in fresh air to forget about life for a brief moment and just be.**

Everything that is being focused on right now is for something greater than we can even think of, that we expect, but the Universe already knows and thats all that matters to me.

**Keep going.**

In an attempt to be more feminine, because its expected of front desk staff (I work for a hotel) to look nice and my voice is OBVIOUSLY that of a woman, I hastily threw on some mascara and cheap earrings. My short hair and gender neutral work uniform in conjunction with a binding bra makes what I am relatively obvious. 
Anyways, on to the story.

I'm unfortunately use to people who hold these opinions loudly, today for example:

 At work this evening these two men in their twenties walk in. They were wearing masks, of course, but it did nothing to hide their blatant disgust.

These guys stood there talking about me under thier breath, I could make a couple comments like ""she must be one of those."" Followed by obvious staring and laughter. When I handed them the keys to their room and started to tell them about everything they needed to know for the hotel they cut me off. Every time I answered a question they would cut me off before I finished speaking. It was incredibly frustrating to say the least. 

My coworker, who is LGBTQ+ also and understands what is happening, was extremely concerned when the whole time. Because nothing was said directly to my face and I am not publicly out we couldn't turn them away or say anything. When they left the desk my emotions must have shown pretty strongly, bless his soul, he made ordered us pizza and spent the rest of the shift doing everything he could to make me laugh. It made me feel lighter but did not make the intensity of my dysphoria too much better. 


TL;DR Had a bad day with my dysphoria and dealt with a couple transphobic guys at work. My coworker  helped cheer me up but it didn't help much.

I am a 28 male that is now questioning. 

So from a young age I remember wanting to be a girl. I had fantasys of waking up as a girl or playing pretend games where I would be turned into a girl. When I grew up I started cross dressing but knew it was weird and I found a book called mom I want to be a girl and fell in love with it. I dropped hints to my parents but they seemed to ignore it so I felt it was just me being weird and kept quiet. In high school I never loved how I looked and never really tried to look good. I would occasionally cross dress but for the most part just stayed the course. Throughout all this still having fantasies of what I would do if I woke up as a girl.

Finally towards end of high school I discovered sissy/cross dressing while I loved it I also thought ah this is a kink I have okay weird kink that explains it. Put it aside started college came back to it every now and then but I would feel embarrassed about it and stop. Now I realized oh wait am I trans? Or was it just a cross dressing fetish. And I'm not sure.

I am usually okay with how I look but sometimes would like to look more fem. I would still love to wake up one day and be female but I think I can live the rest of my life as a man if that doesn't happen. Maybe I'm just gendered fluid, maybe I'm just scarred to accept I'm trans since I'm afraid I won't pass, or maybe I'm just a cross dress and I just really want to fill out a bra.

The movie is not that well known, but I've met people that know it as ""that movie with the really amazing time loop"". People love the time travel of the story but nobody actually mentions how the character is intersex and transition is the core part of the story.

Really... No videos on it, just a handful of articles mentioning it, the movie/character isn't listed on any lists of intersex characters. I'm not sure if it's because it's transphobic (which you could argue it is, and trigger warning for forced reassignment if you intend on watching) or because people forget this movie exists.

I think even a transphobic person I know was fascinated by this movie and its time travel story. I'm amazed that the time travel story overshadows the intersex and transitioning concept.

2021-03-11 16:13:55,m2tueq,11,1,"Hello,

I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post this. I'm also sorry if I'm using wrong or offensive terms, I'm just starting to really learn about that.

My daughter is 9 years old, and her whole life has hated being a girl. As soon as she could, she got her teachers and peers at school to call her Dragon instead of her pretty feminine real name. She's also brilliant and funny and compassionate, and I am so lucky to be her Dad. So far, I've handled it pretty basically; I love her and want her to be happy and that's the most important thing. I don't care if she refuses to wear dresses or girls' clothes. Also, it's hard to say anything at this age, I know, but she does seem really attracted to her two close female friends in a way that's different than the other kids.

I decided to ask for advice for two reasons: one is that she's just starting puberty (she has a medical condition that can cause it to begin early), and two is that she told me the other night that if she could've chosen she'd have chosen to be a boy, and that she feels like a boy most of the time. My response was basically to encourage her to focus on becoming who she is and not to worry about whether that person is a boy or a girl because it doesn't really matter. Also, that it's ok if she wants to be a boy, or a girl, or if she doesn't know.

I guess my question is how do you (whatever your identity) wish your parents had handled your early feelings/experience about this, or, if they did good things, what those were? I don't want to wait until she's 16 to start doing the things to make her feel loved, comfortable, and supported. And though I know a lot of that doesn't change based on how a young person identifies, I thought there are also maybe specific things that I could learn or do to make things better for her if she does identify as male, or if she doesn't know.

I do know sometimes young kids hate being a biological girl (or boy) and then later come to love it or at least be comfortable with it. But for at least as long as she hates her biological birth gender and feels like its opposite, I want to be there for her about it, you know?

Any thoughts/advice appreciated.

2021-03-11 20:23:27,m2ztmz,5,1,"I've had this idea for a while. How it's kinda become a meme to say things like ""you can have mine"" and ""can we trade"" with many secondary and primary sex characteristics (chest, hips, body hair, genetalia, etc.) But there IS something we can actually trade with each other. NAMES! But one big problem... it involves revealing deadnames which is a sensitive issue for a lot of people. But I think it could be a great way to shop around for names. You get the deadnames of other trans people and can use them for yourself if they match your gender! And in exchange you give up your deadname to the list and it can be there for other people to use.

NAMES! But one big problem... it involves revealing deadnames which is a sensitive issue for a lot of people. But I think it could be a great way to shop around for names. You get the deadnames of other trans people and can use them for yourself if they match your gender! And in exchange you give up your deadname to the list and it can be there for other people to use.

Month -2 (june 2020, 18th birthday) still an egg. Something about life felt really off.

Month 0 (august 2020) questioned my gender a whole lot.

Month 1 (september 2020, first term of my fresman year of college) accepted that I'm trans and decided I'll transition. Got a binder, and came out to my mom and a couple closest friends.

Month 2-3 (oct-nov 2020) cut my hair short, updated my wardrobe, and started trying to present masc (though not publicly out yet). Talked to a gender therapist.

Month 5 (january 2021) came out publicly at my college and made the largest steps for my social transition, now using my new name and pronouns full-time here.

Hopefully in the future:

Month 10-12 (june-aug 2021) start T?

Month ~20 (sometime in the first half of 2022, probably either late winter or early summer) top surgery? This would rely on me getting insurance and consults and stuff sorted out pretty soon, which I need to just set a deadline for myself for and just get done, but this is definitely the most important step for me.

Month ~40, year 4 (senior year of college) update my legal documents before starting my career. Unlikely that I'd decide to go stealth, but I'd still like to be able to pass consistently by this point, to be on the safe side.

I'd be interested to hear how this compares to other people's timelines, and how realistic the timing of the last three projected points are.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post a question about this, but I figured I'd give it a shot. Recently I've been finding out my sizes in women's clothing and I can usually find them in plus size sections of stores.

2021-03-12 05:05:00,m3abe0,58,1,"Hello there!

So, I've been noticing a big problem. Many cis people have come to our subreddit and have asked questions about who we are and what we stand for, and in some cases, in a disrespectful manner. But can we really blame them? These people would have had a very conservative upbringing and that could be the reason why they might be disrespectful. They could also be very open minded and just because they messed up on framing the question correctly, the community tends to start bullying them. Do you think this is right? Don't you feel like there is something slightly off here?

I know that many of us in this subreddit face oppression in real life. We are anxious, we are tired of the  bs society gives and we are definitely tired of the world trying to mock us and bring us down. But that does that mean, we beat down on someone trying to educate themselves in the subreddit? 

My personal opinion on this is fairly simple. Let us not discourage people who are trying to learn something new. They themselves might be trans/questioning, they could be out here trying to understand what their friend or family member might be going through or they might be genuinely curious about what we are! 

These people are at least putting up the effort to come onto this subreddit and try and learn something for themselves first hand. They could have instead just listened to some extreme right wing bs and could have been pushed in the wrong direction. We have to appreciate the fact that they have atleast made an effort to learn for themselves and form their opinions about who we are. 

Hence, I request everyone on this subreddit and all the people in the lgbtq+ community. Let us educate the world. Let the world question us a million times. Lets give them the answers repeatedly without ever losing our patience, because the only way the world will understand who we are, is when we go ahead and educate them. Let's not go ahead and say, "" Watch the news dummy"", or ,"" WHY DONT U GOOGLE ABT US!?"".  Because that way, we are shrugging them off. We would be throwing them in the wrong direction. They could start forming negative reviews on us. They themselves could think that this community is toxic and they might start going to extremely horrible transphobic and homophobic information sources and start believing them further belittling our community. 

Let's not do this. Let us go ahead and educate everyone patiently. Even if it means months or years of patience and commitment. Only then, the world will listen. 

In the words of  Martin Luther King Jr. "" Darkness cannot drive out darkness; Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; Only love can do that"". 

Hence lets all join together and help make the world a better place by educating people, patience and love.

Now obviously I cant control those things, but I feel really helpless when she tells me those things because I feel like as a best friend, i need to make it up in a way, so that she doesn’t feel completely alone. I have a hard time finding the right words to say when she mentions how she feels like no one supports her.

I’m so sorry if it is phrased offensively and just want to make it clear that it’s not my intention to harm. I just want to hear trans views and broaden my understanding and worldview and be better. I hope that’s okay. 

I saw a post on BuzzFeed about a school that wants to enforce this rule (trans girls cannot compete in the women’s division). 

I want to start at the outset by saying that I think gender is a social construct and if you feel like a woman, within the construct of what it is to be a woman (or man), then you’re a woman. Biologically, however, until fully transitioned (maybe?), you’re still genetically male. 

Imo there are differences between trans women and cis women in the same way there are differences between women that can have children and women that can’t. I would not want to hear a cis woman talk about how hard it is to be trans. I would not want to hear a trans woman give her opinion on PCOS (assuming that she has no ovaries). Neither is more or less of a woman. These things are different though, because no one is strictly excluded from a space and I appreciate that. 

To put things into context with regard to sport, at my high school, the boys were leagues ahead of the girls when it came to playing football. The girls team was good, even won some competitions, but would never have competed against the boys. There were no trans kids at my school so I have nothing else to go by, but that’s my memory. Women are already on the fringes of sport. If trans women, with biological advantages over cis women which advantages are similar to that of cis men, are competing in the female division, cis woman have little chance and get pushed out even further (after clawing their ways in and still being outsiders). 

So yea I guess gender from a norms and expectations perspective is a construct, but biology isn’t. To my mind.

First off the subject of this post is not trans, she is my wife and she has changed her name. I just couldn’t think of a better community to ask this question. 

My wife recently changed her name because her old name made her really sad and had some terrible memories associated with it. I have supported her fully and I’m super glad she is taking charge and doing what she wants to make her happy. 

My issue comes from us being married almost 10 years and me knowing her as her previous name. I keep deadnaming her out of just pure reflex. She tells me it’s okay but every time I do it I have an extreme amount of guilt and I feel terrible. 

Can anyone give me tips that may help with this? How long did it take people to kinda adapt to your name?

We are interested in understanding how stressful life events impact transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people. If you identify as TGD and have recently experienced a very stressful event and are living in NYC, you might be eligible to participate in this research study. 

The purpose of this research is to promote trauma recovery for trans and gender diverse people by better understanding how discrimination blocks pathways to healing.

Participation in this study involves the completion of 4 interview appointments scheduled over 12 months. During each appointment, you will be asked to participate in a clinical interview, provide salivary samples, and complete several questionnaires. For 14 days following these appointments, you will receive a link each day prompting you to complete a brief questionnaire. Eligible participants may earn up to $360 for study activities.

the thing is, remember Monday was women's day and all? well when I went to school I noticed that they separated girls and dudes in 2 lines (cuz they check our temperature every day before we get inside the building) and the girl's waiting line was litteraly CROWDED so I went to the other line but kept talking to my girl friends cuz I wanted to ask them some stuff about the exam
and then 2 teacheers kinda start waving at me and tell me to go in already- then I'm like ok no and I keep talking
then another teacher comes to me and tells me to go in and I'm like uh then why are the others waiting? and he was staring at my chest the whole time so I knew that he was confused about whether I'm a dude or a girl at some point and I felt so euphoric

like he litteraly COULDN'T tell 

so my friends started teasing me and laughing and saying stuff like ""cmon girl come here"" so he thought I was a girl and went like what are you doing here just go to the other waiting line bla bla and he tried to correct his ""mistake"" by saying that I have a girl's eyes and look very feminine lmaoo

a bunch of people called me sir and young man too this week and- i? I'm so confused? 

like my hair is long (above my shoulders tho) and when I put on a mask my long eyelashes look even more noticeable-

but I really felt so euphoric that it kinda made me feel better about totally screwing my exams

I think that's a mistake. We have much to learn from the stories of people who regret transitioning, both to help prevent other people from making the same mistake, but also because they help trans people who probably should transition in some way get over their own doubts.

So, let's talk about detransitions.

# Foreword

Detransitions are rare. Even among those who do detransition, the vast majority don't do it because they aren't transgender. Some can't afford the hormones. Some can't deal with the transphobia they experience in their lives. Some can't deal with the sexism that comes with living as a woman. Many just detransition temporarily for various reasons. Some realize they're non-binary and fully or partially detransition to be closer to their ideal self. 

However, even then there are some people, who regret transitioning and realize they never were transgender after all. Not many, but they do exist, and with people wanting to transition being on the rise globally (yay), there's pretty much inevitably going to be more people who'll regret transitioning as well.

In order to keep that number as low as possible, it's really important to identify the factors that are usually involved in making someone falsely suspect they might be trans.

# Down the Rabbit Hole

This all started very personally motivated. I only came out to myself last month and I'm still a bit (irrationally) unsure about really being trans. After hearing of TERFs ranting about detransitions one too many times, I was afraid I might end up regretting transitioning, and so I decided to go down the rabbit hole of written testimonials and youtube videos of people who actually did regret detransitioning to see if I had anything in common with them. 

Some were very respectful, others, unfortunately, leaned heavily into transmed narratives and demanded more restrictions on things like hormones.

**What I found was quite interesting, because there's** ***definitely*** **a pattern to detransitions:**

Out of all the testimonials I saw about people detransitioning because they were cis, pretty much every single one had at least two out of these three as *the* main reasons why they initially decided to transition:

1. They were very gender non-conforming (tomboys or femboys) and felt excluded because of it
2. They always hung out with kids of the opposite gender and didn't get along with kids of their own gender
3. They were gay or lesbian and hoped they would experience less discrimination for their relationships as the other gender

What all three of these have in common is that they are about gender expression and not wanting to stand out in society.

 When I compared their experiences with mine I found that my own reasons for being trans are much more intrinsic in nature. Yes, I would like to try dresses at some point and yes, I did often find girls easier to get along with than dudebros, but much more than that I just want to be a girl and be seen as a girl by other people. 

If I lived in a world where men wore dresses and makeup, and women were expected to play football/soccer as kids, and straight relationships were considered weird, and gay relationships normal, that wouldn't really change anything about me wanting to be a girl. I might end up being a gender-non-conforming girl (heck I'm probably going to be a little bit non-conforming even now), but it's the girl part that's important to me, not the conforming part.

Personally, I came out of reading these stories feeling much more secure about my own decision to transition.

I ended up writing about this earlier today in response to another poster who also felt insecure after hearing about detransitions one too many times, and it apparently helped her as well, so I decided this might actually warrant a full post of its own. 

# Conclusion

So yeah, to any questioning or unsure trans people out there, if you feel like there's something inexplicably magical about the idea of being another gender, regardless of how that gender is treated by society, then you almost certainly didn't just accidentally fool yourself into thinking you might be trans. Stop doubting yourself and be the gender that makes you happy!

Now, if on the other hand, you found that you relate to some of the detransitioner perspectives, then I am potentially very sorry for making your doubts worse. I'm not here to gatekeep. I only looked at the perspectives of detransitioners for this. Just because people who ended up detransitioning feel that way, doesn't mean, that there aren't people with very similar experiences happily living the transitioned high-life. 

A question that might help you figure yourself out further is ""Is this really about my gender identity and/or body, or would I be more happy living as a gay femboy or lesbian tomboy in a community that fully accepts me for what I am?"" Try to concentrate on intrinsic matters as much as possible. If your primary reasoning for one over the other is mostly about practical issues (""Being a femboy is probably easier than taking meds and coming out to everyone"", or ""The trans community is so welcoming to me, but I don't know how to find a community of lesbian tomboys"") then there's a good chance you'll end up regretting it latter. 

# What About Non-Binaries

This post so far has been pretty binary-trans-focused so far, because that's where my own personal experiences lie. I don't know how well it applies to non-binary trans people.

From all the ""Someone called me they today and holy shit, I'm so happy!"" posts I've seen in this sub and others, I would assume that most enbies share a similar experience of there being something intrinsically magical about being seen as both genders, neither gender, or something in between. 

However, I might be wrong about that. **If you are non-binary and have your own thoughts and experiences to share on this, please do, and I will link your post here.**",trans,Let's talk about Detransitions,1615606445.0,"{'created_utc': 1615581245, 'id': 'm3qhar', 'num_comments': 36, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Detransitions (or Retransitions as some prefer to call them) are a bit of a sore spot in the trans community and not talked about often, mostly because of how much they are regularly weaponized against us. \n\nI think that\'s a mistake.

I wanna preface this with a little backstory. So, when I was little, I had the typical signs of gender dysphoria and when I was 13, I came out to them by writing them a letter, and in the letter I said I would want to talk to them. I was too uncomfortable with discussing these topics with them, and I thought they would understand that, but the topic wasn't brought up. I then wrote them a second letter, about a year later, saying I wasn't comfortable talking about it and could they please bring it up. No response. I wrote multiple letters, but the only times where anything has happened as a result of the letters were once when I threatened to hurt myself if they kept ignoring it and a second time when I just totally ripped into them, like it was honestly brutal, but I felt it was needed because literally nothing was changing and I felt as though my life was becoming at risk. So, all together, I lost about 3 or potentially 4 years of time as a result of this stalling. I live in the UK, so the healthcare here would be free, however the waiting list is two years. I don't want to wait this length of time, and I honestly feel wronged in that if we would've discussed it earlier, I would already be at a clinic. A relative in our care passed away last year who was claiming child benefits for me before, so my parents recently started claiming for me. I have discussed with them the possibility of me using this child benefits money to fund puberty blockers until I can transfer to the NHS, however they said they would want me to get therapy first, which is fine, I really don't care about that, I'm sure I'll get through it, but this makes finances more of a question mark.

2021-03-13 03:46:45,m3yepj,15,1,"This is a long post. I am genuinely not trying to offend anyone with this, so if I do I'm really sorry. I just have so many questions about what the fuck gender and sex mean to other people. I am a trans guy, but I have recently started questioning everything I thought I knew about my own identity and don't even know what I am anymore.

I've been trying to learn more about trans experiences that differ from my own, especially people with experiences that fall outside the binary. The way I have heard some non binary folks talk about their gender had really resonated with me. But at the same time, it has made me very confused about my own gender which I have always just labeled as ""male"". But at this point I don't even know what ""male"" means. 

This has got me thinking a lot about the fact that gender is a construct, and the more I think about gender, the less it makes sense. I'm not even sure what gender is. The only reason I knew I was trans and needed to transition was because I had an intense and painful disconnect from my physical body from a young age, especially when I started to go through puberty. I felt the correct attributes for me were that of a natal male. Any of my preferences regarding clothing, hair, interests, or social roles are not what made me trans. I enjoy a mixture of masculine, feminine, and androgynous in terms of how I present and act as a human. At the end of the day, I am a person who would feel most comfortable with a stereotypical natal male body who enjoys presenting in any way I want in the moment. 

Basically the only reason I know I'm male is because cis male genitals and secondary sex characteristics are what I identify with, as opposed to the characteristics I was born with. My gender is pretty much irrelevant to me. In my personal experience, it is my physical sex that made me trans. That isn't to say that my outward gender didn't and doesn't play a role into who I am, but it was not the deciding factor in what personally made me a trans man. At the end of the day, I would ideally love to present incredibly femininely to incredibly masculine to androgynous... All while having my preferred physical sex. 

So if gender is solely a construct, yet sex does not denote one's gender, then what is gender or sex at all? If genitals don't equal gender, and gender doesn't really mean anything, then what am I? I'm not a man. I just have a preference of sex. But genitals do not make you male, female, non binary, or anything else. They just are. So at the end of the day, I am nothing. Because gender and sex don't mean anything. Does this make any sense? I swear I am not trolling, I am just coming to this insane realization and I feel like I'm kind of losing my identity. 

So please, if you've read this far, share what gender and sex mean to you. What makes you who you are? Do you believe in gender? Do you believe in sex? Please help me because I'm losing my mind lol. 

Thanks.

2021-03-13 03:54:07,m3yimj,5,1,"Ok so recently I discovered that I’m actually a trans guy and all the clues added up, but now I’m finding other clues that kinda contradict it.

I keep feeling like I’m invalid because a lot of people say they always they they were that gender. But I never really knew until last December. I was actually fine being a girl, sometimes I actually kinda liked it and felt a connection. There were little hints growing up, but nothing too obvious, and for the most part I felt like a girl, and even said “I like masculine features but I’m okay with being a girl, I wouldn’t really wanna become a boy” in my first stages of discovering my gender. But after some discovery, it did a 180, dysphoria hit me like a truck, and I really don’t wanna be a girl anymore and I’d do so many things just to be a boy.

Also I kinda like the idea of being seen as a girl by a boy, but also I don’t ever wanna be seen as a girl. Like I like the way a boy romantically sees a girl, but not as much with the way a boy sees a boy. But also I wanna be seen as a boy to girls, aaand I know this is really confusing, I don’t know either.

Also I feel like if I looked a certain way I’d maybe wanna be a different gender. Like I feel like I’m a guy, but going on Pinterest and seeing androgynous people, I feel like if I were them I’d want to be non-binary. And then I go imagine myself as them and I get kinda euphoric with they/them pronouns. But if I don’t imagine myself as them, if I just imagine myself as me it doesn’t happen. I wouldn’t want their body as my permanent one, but I feel like switching into it occasionally would be nice.

I used to be kinda dysphoric from she/her pronouns and I still kinda am, but in the right context (kinda like how I mentioned in the last paragraph) sometimes I actually kinda like it, and l know that gender doesn’t equal pronouns but these could be clues.

This kinda makes me conflicted because with these clues I feel like I could be gender fluid but I don’t want to be, that feels too complicated and I just wanna be a trans guy, nothing else.

Also several months ago I identified as bigender (in my discovery, the girl part of me faded away while the boy part grew, so in order, I identified as female, then demigirl, then bigender, then demiboy, then to now, as fully male) and the label really felt right, and then the rightness kinda faded away.

This is so damn annoying because for three straight months I was really dysphoric and felt fully like a guy but now there’s this stuff ughh

So like is this normal for a trans guy to feel like a girl for most of his life and then in puberty suddenly it does a 180 and I feel like a complete guy?

But also is it normal for gender fluid people to feel this way?

## Māhū (Hawaii):

Long before Cook's arrival in Hawaii, a multiple gender tradition existed among the Kanaka Maoli indigenous society. The māhū could be biological males or females inhabiting a gender role somewhere between or encompassing both the masculine and feminine. Their social role is sacred as educators and promulgators of ancient traditions and rituals. The arrival of Europeans and the colonization of Hawaii nearly eliminated the native culture, and today mahu face discrimination in a culture dominated by white European ideology about gender.

Despite this, the māhū still exist in hawaii and have managed to survive over 200 years of discrimination, colonization and attempts to abolish them.

“Māhū were particularly respected as teachers, usually of hula dance and chant. In pre-contact times māhū performed the roles of goddesses in hula dances that took place in temples which were off-limits to women. Māhū were also valued as the keepers of cultural traditions, such as the passing down of genealogies. Traditionally parents would ask māhū to name their children.”

## Calabai, Calalai, and Bissu (Indonesia):

The Bugi people of southern Sulawesi recognize three sexes (male, female, intersex) and five genders: men, women, calabai, calalai, and bissu. Calabai are biological males who embody a feminine gender identity. Calalai are biological females who embody a male gender identity. Bissu are considered a ""transcendent gender,"" either encompassing all genders or none at all. The bissu (shown in first image above) serve ritual roles in Bugi culture and are sometimes equated with priests.

The Bugis people are the most numerous of the three major ethnic groups of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, with about 3 million people. Most Bugis are Muslim, but many pre-Islamic rituals continue to be honoured in their culture, including the view that gender exists on a spectrum.

In contrast to the gender binarism, Bugis society recognizes five genders: makkunrai, oroané, bissu, calabai, and calalai. The concept of five genders has been a key part of their culture for at least six centuries. Similar citings can be found in the traditions in Thailand, Malaysia, India and Bangladesh.

Oroané are comparable to cisgender men, makkunrai to cisgender women, calalai to trans men, and calabai to trans women, while bissu are androgynous or intersex and revered shamans or community priests.

## Baklâ &amp; Tomboy (Philippines):

Bakla are often considered as the natural ""third gender"" in Filipino culture. This is illustrated in the children's rhyme that begins by listing four distinct genders: ""girl, boy, baklâ, tomboy.""

In the Philippines, a baklâ is a person who was assigned male at birth and has adopted a feminine gender expression. They are often considered a third gender. Many bakla are exclusively attracted to men, but are not necessarily gay. The polar opposite of the term in Philippine culture is tomboy, which refers to women with a masculine gender expression.

Bakla are socially and economically integrated into Filipino society, having been accepted by society prior to Western colonization, many of which were held in high regard and performed the role of spiritual leaders known as babaylan, katalonan, and other shamans in pre-colonial Philippines. However, a minority group of Filipinos disapprove or reject the baklas, usually on religious grounds. The stereotype of a baklâ is a parlorista—a flamboyant, camp cross-dresser who works in a beauty salon; in reality, the bakla thrives in numerous sectors of society, from the lower to the upper levels.

Bakla is also sometimes used as a term for trans women, though this is incorrect and discouraged. This is largely due to the absence of modern local terms for transgender people, as well as the general public ignorance of the differences between homosexuality and transgeder people. Some organizations have pushed for the adoption of new terminology that distinguishes transgender people from the bakla, to prevent the common derogatory misconception that trans women and trans men are simply bakla and tomboy that have undergone sex reassignment surgery.

## Whakawahine (Maori, New Zealand):

In Maori tradition In Maori culture, wakawahine are men who prefer the company of women and take up traiditionally feminine occupations such as weaving. Wakatane denotes a biological female who pursues traditionally male roles, such as becoming a warrior or engaging in physical labor.

I’ve not been able to find more information when it comes to the Maori culture’s gender identities, so if you as a viewer got any information to share about  it then please leave a comment ‘bout it.

## Mino (The Kingdom of Dahomey):

The Kingdom of Dahomey (now Benin) had an all-female regiment of female warriors called the mino, which translates to “our mothers”. They were unmarried and childless women who were thought to have masculine or aggressive traits.

The Mino took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), they generally supported peace with Abeokuta and stronger commercial relations with England, favouring the trade in palm oil above that in slaves; this set them at odds with their male military colleagues.

The reason why I have the Mino in this list is due to their stunning similarities with the Amazons. No not the company, get your head out of the gutter. I’m talking about the Greek mythology Amazons. A society with only female warriors who dressed in men clothing and basically took the male gender role as their own while still not identifying with being male. One could argue that it’s a third gender, even if it is stretching it a little.

I am a cis man (18) and recently I have been wondering if I would feel better about being trans or not. What led me to that conclusion? That I like to wear women's clothes, I feel good being feminine, dominated, passive and that maybe I was happier being a woman than a man in matters of self-esteem and many other things. 

The point is that my head is so fucked up and I couldn't take the pressure from society, from my parents (probably homophobic and transphobic I never discussed it with them, but I notice an aversion), a proof of this was the capillary transition from short to long , rather simple how growing my hair affected me too much and I almost gave up. 

Society's prejudices can be ingrained and limit my ability to think about it and make a decision. 

I think that when I am independent and have my home I can buy women's clothes and dress the way I want, in the private I will always wear ""women's clothes"" and in the public I will wear ""men's clothes"".

I don't know why but I very rarely see any mentions of trans people living in third-world countries. We don't receive any attention. It's as if we don't exist, but we do, and I'm here to let you know what it's like.

Our very existence is considered a crime. Depending on what country it is, we could be punished by death, and if it's not death then it's decades of imprisonment. Our parents will never ever approve of us, if we tell them, then we'll be disowned in the blink of an eye (assuming they don't kill us instead). So we live in hiding, and we're absolutely terrified. 

If the wrong person knows about who we really are, then it's over for us. Information will spread around and it'll eventually reach our parents who will most likely kill us when they know. Also, the government is spying on everyone's social media so we have to be very very VERY careful if we're gonna talk about our transness online. What's even more horrifying is that cops have the right to stop you and ask to check your phone so they can scroll through your social media accounts, and you can't say no or else you'll be facing jail. 

In third-world countries, governments intentionally make you depend on your parents for financial situations. Your parents control every single aspect of your life, and that's the norm. Your parents don't respect your privacy, they will check your phone if they want to, they will literally track your movements through GPS. And of course, you can't run away. How can you do that? The minimum-wage accounts to NOTHING. There is no way you could survive on a minimum-wage job, renting an apartment is unusually expensive, and even if you do that then what? You're still stuck in a country where your existence is illegal. 

So why not just leave the country you ask? If it were that simple then we would've done it a long time ago. In third-world countries, entering the army is mandatory which puts restrictions on traveling. To get a visa, they need to see a bank statement and there has to be a lot of money in your bank account. Of course, you can't use your parent's bank statements since they will never approve of the idea of you traveling on your own. Not to mention how expensive a plane ticket is. So you try to search for a different alternative.

You start researching for any institution that will help you escape, such as Rainbow Railroad. You email them, and they don't reply back. So you're left feeling alone, hopeless, defeated. If by some miracle you manage to travel to a different country on your own, you're gonna have to seek asylum and there is absolutely no guarantee that you'll get it. 

Being trans is a beautiful thing, I'm a proud trans woman. It took me a long time to accept that, and when I finally embraced who I truly am I felt a huge sense of relief and happiness washing over my heart. But when you're trans in a continent where all countries consider your existence illegal, in a continent where homophobia, transphobia and sexism are the norm, in a continent where you can't even do the least feminine thing like putting nail polish or else you'll get beaten up in the streets, then your life becomes a nightmare. 

My life is a nightmare I can't wake up from. This country, this continent, fills me with fear and dread. I'm on the verge of having an intense breakdown every time I take a walk in the streets. I feel suffocated, claustrophobic, horrified. I wish the United Nations would give us the least bit of attention, I wish the social media would at least acknowledge us. However, it's all so focused on what's happening in the USA and Europe. Meanwhile, we're left in the dirt. No one cares about us, no one acknowledges us, and no one wants to help us. 

We have to figure out everything on our own, we have to develop complex escape plans with a 0.1% success rate. Everyday we have to pretend to be someone we're not, we have to be very careful and vigilant so no one could ever guess that we're trans. Life is so difficult. Everyday, life gets more and more claustrophobic. Our countries aren't even getting any better, somehow they're becoming more and more regressive at a terrifying rate. I'm trying to escape but I'm not sure it's gonna work anymore. So as you can see, being trans in a third-world country is a nightmarish experience. 

I'm sorry but I had to vent. I had to let it all out, everything seems so bleak and hopeless. I'm sorry, I just had to let it all out.

2021-03-13 18:36:49,m4cayd,4,1,"Hi. I’m pretty young to start off so things are obviously a mess since I’m a hormonal child.

I’m Lixian and I’m a Non-Binary Boy (not exactly sure if I’m a Demi-Boy but non-binary boy has been the most comfortable). I use he/they pronouns and I am AFAB.

I’ve come out to a few of my close friends (I’m very much free with my online best friend and my irl best friend, love them both) and I’ve tried coming out to my mom. Now my mom is extremely loving and I see from her point of view.

I’m European (partially) and my family is pretty traditional. My mom isn’t like- pissed off that I think I’m trans. When I came out, it really didn’t feel like I did. I don’t know how to explain it but when I did, I feel like my mom didn’t try to listen to me and instead brushed it off the first time.

I’ve wanted a binder for awhile now (still do but I just haven’t found one yet), I hate my chest and I cannot stand showering and just looking at myself and seeing a female.

I’ve cut my hair, I wear slightly more masculine clothing. Kinda obvious that I’m not very feminine.

I struggle talking about how I feel with my mom (it never really goes well and I don’t feel heard by her, I know that’s not her intention). I’ve basically given up on talking about it with her. She really thinks it’s a phase that I’ll grow out of. All I’ve wanted to do is tell her that I want to start using my middle name instead of my first and use he/they pronouns. She says she’s trying and I know she is but at the same time, I feel like she’s just, messing with it?

She jokes with me and will say ‘whatever you are’ or ‘human person’ and it feels not that great.

When I used a name with my online friend (I don’t use the name anymore) she started singing happy birthday to me (obviously on my birthday) using the name and I feel like it was just a joke. Her tone, the way she said it. It made me feel like crap for the rest of the day.

I also have a problem in school. Hearing my teachers use she/her in class for me makes my stomach knot. I wanna come out to my teachers but I’m so anxious about it.

I don’t really know how to do anything about feeling comfortable-ish. I’m also in piano and I have to preform, one of the things I hate. When I got to preform in person, I had to wear dresses. I hated myself being on stage so much. My piano teacher did give me crap about cutting my hair which still kinda hurts. She’s also very traditional and I’m certain she was hoping I’d be a feminine,  beautiful, pianist.

I just wanna hear some responses, maybe how I could come out to my teachers or help my mom understand because I’ve tried coming out to her multiple times but she will barely let me socially transition because she’s worried that the family won’t accept me. Honestly, I could care less. She’s also scared I’ll get attacked like a trans friend of mine who’s out.

Thanks for coming to my ramble. Nothing here makes sense but I just wrote what I really wish I could tell people.

I've been out for about 10 years by now (I'm 25). I got a new job and I didn't come out yet, because the country I'm in is super conservative and no laws protect trans people here.  
My dysphoria is so debilitating, I get really bad panic attacks when people call me certain (feminine) words or birthname. (We don't have gendered pronouns in my language at least...)  
I really want to be treated as and called a guy, using my chosen name, to avoid this stress and painful dysphoria. I got a friend there who is also FtM, so he makes my days easier. My boss seems nice but she's an older lady and I'm very unsure... I don't want to be discriminated against for something I didn't choose or want, when I'm such a hard worker, a polite, caring, kind person, literally doing everything I can to be useful for the company...  
I would love to eventually step up (get a higher position job), and help others to learn the tasks, but it's difficult like this.  
I also recently started going to the doctors I have to see, to start HRT. But I need this job to save up for top surgery, soooo bad.

As a cis person, I do not feel it is appropriate for me to explore his transition, nor is it relevant to the story to show.  I'm having trouble finding ways to establish him as trans that don't feel clunky or heavy handed. 

For context: 

* The story is a mystery/drama that takes place in a fantasy setting in which magic exists, and the idea of discriminating against someone based on their gender identity/sexual orientation is much rarer. Being trans is not incredibly common, but it is also not viewed in a negative light.
* He transitioned years prior to the start of the story, but does not consider his gender a particularly central part of his identity. (Meaning that, if asked, he would answer questions about it, but he does not offer up the information unprompted) 

Should I state his identity outright, even though that is not the typical response in the setting, or should I leave it in context clues (e,i descriptions of the character from an outward perspective)? I considered having a scene in which he is changing in private, and describing him removing/putting on his binder, or otherwise informing the audience without it being something that feels forced coming up in conversation between characters.

I would appreciate any insight you may have!

2021-03-13 23:21:15,m4i7e1,5,1,"OK so for context I live in Argentina and I go to a public school. In Argentine public schools, the uniform is usually a white lab coat with whatever long pants you have (as long as they aren't brightly coloured or torn). You can wear whatever accessories you want and you can wear your hair however you want. Some schools don't allow piercings and they mostly don't allow short pants or skirts. There's no difference in dressing code between boys and girls. And with the pandemic you can wear whatever design you want in your mask as long as it's functional and you wear it correctly.

The thing is, classes just started and most girls wear long hair, earrings, and makeup, and most guys wear short hair and more simple clothing, so teachers just assume their students gender and they're right most of the time. They, of course, apologise if they're wrong.

I have short hair, don't wear makeup nor earrings or anything that would be considered femenine. That, plus the fact that when I wear loose clothes no one can see any curves, and the fact that everyone has to wear a mask due to the pandemic, makes every teacher in my school think I'm a boy. One even went as far as writing my name as Camilo (male name) instead of it's female counterpart, Camila, which is my name, even after hearing my very high pitched voice. 

My only friend at school asks me why don't I correct them. I always tell her it's because I don't care and I think it's funny. But the truth is that every time someone thinks I'm a guy, I get extremely happy and confident and even more comfortable with myself. My own mother confessed that she thought I was a random guy when my dad showed him a video of me where my face was kinda blurred. And that actually made me happy. 

The problem is I don't want to change my body. I like how it looks, I feel comfortable in it, and I really like my voice, specially because I sing very well in a lyrical style and I can imitate lots of different animals. If my voice changed, all of those cool things would go away or be very hard to get back. Besides, I don't plan to show my body since I always cover all of my body when I go out simply because I feel more comfortable like that, and I like how I look with more clothes on. So unless I want to have sex with someone no one will see my body as very female, I'm mostly androgynous looking.

I have an older brother who really was that kid too, which just seemed to solidify to my parents it was the right way to go about things. 

Where he flourished though, I failed miserably. I hated playing sports with my brother, being compared to him and having my worth measured using metrics that were meaningless to me. His popularity rose. My depression began manifesting. All the while I had no real clue as to what the problem was.

My parents did not change course as we got older. My brother graduated, was on track to do some college and traveling with his high school sweet heart. I was a drug addict that had been to the ward on several occasions and a dropout. I took another 10 good years fucking up my body and mind with drugs in an effort to stop the squirming of my own skin, the feeling that your body is not your own, and that things are NOT all right. 

I survived 4 purposeful ODs thanks to narcan and after the last time I just said FINE, FUCK YOU and gave up trying to end it. Sobriety followed through much help from my family but about 5 years in I was still wildly depressed. Something was not right the entire time and for years I just wrote it off as anhedonia from getting clean, or something.

Trans women are women but all I want to say is, there is a difference between trans women and cis women. The difference between a man and a woman is not just genitals, whole muscle and bone structure, organs are different, we can't even change the voice!

Trans women are generally obvious, if not by the voice, if not by the face, by the body. I mean yeah, there is some convincing trans women outside but I don't want to be convincing, I want to be a cis women, with everything. I even want to have periods.

I have nothing against trans women, I can understand them, I can be friends with them I can even marry them. Looks are not everything for me, I can of course love and have sex with a trans person, man or woman but generally I actually don't find it physically appealing. I mean, I find cis women's body and face and voice is more attractive than a trans woman's. While this is not a reason to not to have sex with any trans person, it is a reason for me to not to be a trans. I don't know if I could even if I wanted to, it's generally a hard process but I prefer to be a cis guy than being a trans girl.

Again, I can love and have sex with trans people but I don't want to be a trans even if I want to be a girl. I think our technology is not enough for it yet. Changing whole bones and muscles and organs is not possible, maybe head transplants can be something in the future, a future really far away but with today's technology, I don't prefer to be a trans woman. I wish I was born a woman and I have nothing against trans people but still these are my thoughts. Does that make me transphobic?

As the title says, I just told my girlfriend of over two years that I am trans. This had been something I questioned quietly for years, but only really started to take seriously like 2-3 months ago. I’ve made so much quite progress in the last few months and it pained me every day that I didn’t tell her. We talked about it and cried a lot together. We both still love eachother, but she is a straight woman and wouldn’t be comfortable dating someone feminine. We are like best friends and still plan on being good friends, now that the catgirl is out of the bag, within a bit of time of course.

My heart still hurts from the breakup, which is unsurprising because it JUST happened a little over an hour ago, but at the same time my mind feels clearer. I no longer feel like I am lying to her and am hopeful that we’re still able to be close(albeit in a new capacity). My head hurts from all of the crying, and is   filled with thoughts about what the future may bring.

I am a really enthusiastic reader of nonfiction, and my go to for complex topics is often to read (what are considered authoritative) books on them. Biology is one of my guilty pleasures in that regard.

I am often at a loss to explain the concept of gender spectrum to other people, partly because I have a layperson, casual understanding of it myself. 

I am also aware that there has been very intriguing science done recently to understand the neurochemical underpinnings of gender, trans people etc.

Is there a good book explaining the science? Hopefully recent, hopefully in a pop science, but well researched sort of way? Thank you!

1. I am not, right now, interested in the philosophical side of gender and identity. Reading philosophy is not really my cup of tea as of yet

2. I am not, as yet, interested in the civil rights side of the debate. I will get there, feel free to suggest books on that too.

Hi, I'm your local slaanesh demoness.
I hardly feel dysphoria, then again I hardly feel anything but sarcasm and void. This above, is what I myself sometimes have to hear, you might have to too.
I came out when I where 12, start of puberty. Needless to say, my parents didn't react, so here I am nine years later, moved out and just starting.
I hardly experience dysphoria, I just know that I'm trans. Kinda like how a cat knows the warmest place to sleep. I Kling to this feeling of knowing like my life depended on it, and sometimes it's exactly how I feel.
My friends and my psych says that I could get hrt in three months time, but there's still the voice in the back of my head calling for dysphoria to prove I'm trans. That my lack of dysphoria invalidates me. Even if I know, that I can't stand living as a man when I've tasted life in womanhood, and I would rather die than go back to masculinity.

He may have kept it gender neutral. But I’m not sure.) they also whispered things to each other. So...\n\nI’m not sure if I’m being paranoid about it or not. I never tell my parents anything. They found out about my divorce from my Real estate agent, and found out I had to call the cops on my ex from my ex’s mom...

2021-03-14 05:18:14,m4ootl,5,1,"   I have a diagnosis of schizophrenia even though I have doubts that any broad diagnosis could pinpoint such a specific variant and mean anything substantial. 
   To get to the point, I hear voices. These voices are sentient and have their own free will and are a separate consciousness. If you have heard of a similar mental disorder you may also know that not all of the thought forms’ or “voices’” genders reflect the biological sex of their host or body. What I find most interesting about this is that not only do they have the voice of their respective gender, they also have many characteristics almost on a primal level. I believe you would say and have said that agreeableness is trait found more commonly in or at least to a more ample extent in females. The majority of them are also sexually attracted to the the opposite gender relative to their own. I won’t go into detail here about the specifics of which character traits are more common in which gender but I’m sure you are already well aware. 
   This is where I find more of the psychological aspects of gender. If these voices of an opposing gender can exist in a body biologically different from their nature, why can’t it be the same for the host consciousness? These beings with separate gender identity than the host are so prone to the gender they identify as that it is almost like they are hooked up to inverse hormones making them behave almost stereotypically to their individual gender orientation.
   It is common for a specific group to self induce a type thought form that is similar to a schizophrenic thought forms except they way they create them is almost like raising an infant in the way that they are highly suggestible during the early parts of the creation process. Even well before the thought form has any independent thoughts of its own the creator uses their own thoughts and imagery to sculpt their thought form. You could see how anyone might be suggested hypnotically if they had someone else’s ideas of who they should be were put into their mind before they ever had their first independent thought. 
   To further my point about gender being more of a psychological phenomenon than a physical one, this specific group is known for switching control of the physical body with their created through form. So in essence, the host could create a voice of a different gender and allow them to posses the body. Now if the being is most definitely the opposite gender of the host in nearly every psychological aspect and is in full control of the physical body, what gender are they? Will their full consciousness be ignored on the basis of the genitalia between their legs? 
   I personally have never switch control of my physical with anything being even though some consciousness have tried to take it by force. I have been kicked out of my body and placed in a mental room with someone I shared what I believe to be my deepest ID thoughts with for a short time. But thankfully I was able to return safely. 
   I’m not sure where to end this because I have much to say but I think I got my point across. I would love your opinion and response.

We live in Idaho, which is a fairly conservative state, meaning there aren’t many openly queer people here, so when looking for advice on this subject I figured you lovely people would be the best to turn to. 

So I’ll just run down my suspicions, that is sort of cluing me into the possibility of him questioning. Growing up he did a lot of things that where very feminine. I can think of vividly one time where he was playing with a basket pretending to be a flower girl. He was about 6 I was 11, I asked him what he was doing and he said something along the lines of “I used to be a girl so now I like pretending I’m a girl” basic gist of that. He also loved playing with toys more marketed towards girls. Now since he is a bit more grown up, I can tell he just isn’t comfortable in his own skin. He doesn’t like any of the close he wears, he doesn’t like being seen, or seeing himself without cloths. You can just tell he really has some body image issues that is bothering him. He has come out as gay, which all our family except a few extended family have fully supported, but it’s been a very vague “don’t ask don’t tell” type of support outside of me, my sister, and parents, who support him with our entire hearts. 

Now that I myself have come to realize that I am Bi (haven’t came out to any family for my own reasons) I have begun to mingle within in the queer community, and I’m starting to feel like his story shares similarities with a lot of stories from trans people I have met or heard about. I want to ask him outright but also know this is a sensitive topic and I could also just be wrong, I figured all of you here who are trans (love you all btw) would know the best way about telling him I support him and want to help him feel more comfortable in his own skin, with out forcing him to out himself, if he even needs to come out. I’ve been trying to show him that breaking gender norms is ok, I’m a fairly masculine guy and I’ve started to wear colorful nail polish, as well as using light makeup like concealer and what not to just kinda hint that it’s ok (best I can think of at the moment, also my nails look amazing)

Basically, do you all think I’m correct in feeling that he is questioning his gender, and if so how how do I let him know it’s ok

I do my best to support my students, but I am unsure how to handle this situation. There's really not much to handle, but every day I interact with this person I I making choices about how to address them whether I like it or not. 

I am a sixth grade math teacher. I am generally uncomfortable with the idea of one of these young kids believing they are trans. To me, it seems a religious ideal. I do not grok how a person can be born into the wrong body. I think bodily acceptance (and gender identity acceptance) should be encouraged and supported, but not at the expense of coping with extant reality.

I do understand that people can be more masculine or feminine and am very supportive and protective of students who express that they are gay. I have several who are open about being bi or gay. I think this openness is relatively unique to my classroom. I hope that it is a result of my earnest desire to support and protect them. I also hope it compares these backwoods kids for interaction with modern society. We are isolated here. It is a one stoplight, one grocery store type of place. People are generally poor white rednecks or poor Hispanics. I have a few homeless kids and nearly all with broken families. Given the backwoods mentality, kids often use ""gay"" as an insult and I constantly challenge and discuss this with them when it occurs. I don't think that's particularly unique to this place, but I've worked with a lot of kids in many environments (many places and settings) and it is usually not so intense. 

I can tell from comments and discussion that virtually nobody (aside from two friends, maybe) is supportive of this student believing they are trans. I have considered at multiple times asking this student for their preferred pronouns. I have not yet done so, because I don't want to play God with this kid's life. I am also not convinced that it is wise in general. I am not entirely sure that I want to support this idea. I very much do, however, want to support and connect with this student. The simple gesture of asking their preferred pronouns, I intuit, would greatly strengthen our relationship....  but also validate that dyphoria and send a message to other students. 

Further complicating the issue, this student is clearly in psychological distress. Despite capability, they are not doing well in my class. They sometimes make quiet, intensely negative comments. We share these moments as dark humor, but I can tell there is an element of truth to them.  

I discussed this issue with a friend tonight, and upon bringing it into linguistic specificity, decided I would ask a few reddit communities for feedback and advice. 

Any ideas? Should I ask this student or not? Should I continue on as if nothing is happening?

2021-03-14 16:44:14,m4ymz9,3,2,"Hi,
(English isn't my native language so there probably will be quite a lot of mistakes) 

I don't know what this is and to be honest, I feel like I am just wasting the time of anyone that is reading. I normally never post like anything on any social media so this one probably will be a little weird. 

I am trans. I am amab. I am 18. I started questioning nearly 4 years ago and I have been sure for the last 1.5-2 years. And I from a really transphobic and homophobic country and I don't know what to do anymore. It feels like I never will be happy and most days I feel really down. And I don't have anyone to talk to about this so I just will be writing here. 

I came out to my parents and a single friend. And this is my first time posting anything trans related online. That friend I mentioned kinda didn't even understand what was trans and didn't care that much so we just never mentioned it ever again I am pretty sure she doesn't even remember it. 

For my parents, they are normally quite progressive compared to people here but they still are kinda transphobic. I know they have my best interest at heart. I came out to them and I thought they were at least okay with it. They wanted me to go to a gender psychologist (which spoiler alert didn't go that well) and I thought things were going great, I might actually transition, and my parents were okay with it. So I went there once with them and several times alone and I couldn't speak nearly at all I just didn't know what to say and got all anxious, so I literally sat there silent 40~45 minutes every week (and to be honest I really don't get like why he nearly never asked anything, like that could have made everything much easier looking back now) and I just felt like I was wasting my parents' money and stuff. And not being able to just talk and I don't know, it pushed me back into the closet. 

So after the end of that school year, my parents suggested me to move back with them and I just agreed, I felt just numb. And since I moved back I never talked with anyone about being trans. Except once, this wasn't that much trans related but at a friend's birthday she jokingly wanted to paint my nails and I knew my parents would be angry about it so I resisted it at first but she insisted a lot and me being a people pleaser I just agreed even though I knew what was going to happen. After the birthday when I went back home they were furious and made me take it off asap and after I did my dad just came to my room and he was talking about how traumatic my coming out was and I don't know, until that moment I always thought they just didn't know or they were supportive at the end and stuff but at that moment I kinda felt like my reality was shattered. I don't know, it is probably silly and I am just making a big deal out of it but that moment just hurt so much. Seeing someone you thought was supportive actually always being just not. 

After I moved I have made few friends but it still feels really wrong or odd from time to time, I don't know how I can put this feeling into words. I feel like I am always lying and just keeping secrets from them, I feel like a really bad friend, never sharing anything about my personal life and never explaining why I am feeling bad when I feel dysphoric. 

I wanna come out to one of my friends I am like %99 sure she would be supportive but I still fear that I would lose her or she would like just out me to everyone (which I know she would never do but for some reason I am still worried). And still want to somehow re-come out to my parents and find a better (or one I can talk to more comfortably) psychologist and start hrt somehow.

When i was little, one of my favorite companions was a plushy blue cat, with satin on the insides of her ears. How i adored the feeling to brush my lips against that satin. Like the soft moss that grew in the front garden at my Gran's, how i loved to press my cheeks and lips against their exquisitely soft surfaces. How i loved my little blue cat. She had a blue satin bow around her neck.

50 years later, and she was utterly exhausted, like me. The stuffing had leaked out of her. When i came out to my parents back in 2018 in a restaurant, i took my little cat with me. A couple of years beforehand, i had damaged my wrist severely and can no longer sew accurately as a result

As a way of reaching out to my Mum, who, notwithstanding her 78 years, is still an extremely capable seamstress, i gave my little blue cat to her, asking her whether she could repair her for me. Looking back on this, the symbolism was deep. I have never felt accepted by my birth family, and guess there was something really primal and deep in me that gave my little cat to my Mum, broken, at a truly dark time in my life when i felt i had only the choice between suicide and losing the relationship with the person i most love in the world (my wife). I think was asking my Mum subconsciously to heal her, and, in doing so, asking her to heal and accept me a little. My little blue cat, broken, deflated and tired, was so, so much like me on that day.

My Mum agreed to do this. At the time i felt she really understood my reaching out to her. And my parents on that day asserted that they would always support me. But this promise has not been honored with deeds - quite the opposite - in the two and a half years since.

Today my darling wife, who is still at my side, asked my Mum about my little blue cat. Apparently my little blue cat has been discarded. I entrusted her to my Mum. She was under no obligation - but she seemed so enthusiastic.

I can barely put the hurt i feel into words.

I have never felt accepted by my birth family, and guess there was something really primal and deep in me that gave my little cat to my Mum, broken, at a truly dark time in my life when i felt i had only the choice between suicide and losing the relationship with the person i most love in the world (my wife). I think was asking my Mum subconsciously to heal her, and, in doing so, asking her to heal and accept me a little. My little blue cat, broken, deflated and tired, was so, so much like me on that day.\n\nMy Mum agreed to do this. At the time i felt she really understood my reaching out to her. And my parents on that day asserted that they would always support me. But this promise has not been honored with deeds - quite the opposite - in the two and a half years since.\n\nToday my darling wife, who is still at my side, asked my Mum about my little blue cat. Apparently my little blue cat has been discarded. I entrusted her to my Mum. She was under no obligation - but she seemed so enthusiastic.\n\nI can barely put the hurt i feel into words.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0agps8wc2n61.jpg?width=2698&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a491d1037f66ff20dc8e2ea70fccb56896773fb7"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I am really, really feeling low .....', 'created': 1615783490.0}"

So, we know that non-binary people can be lesbians. It's quite a commonly accepted fact in relevant communities now, which is a positive thing. However, everyone I've seen describe themselves in this way has been AFAB. I've spoken to a couple of friends about how you can be non binary and a lesbian when i was initially confused, and they all said it was to do with a connection to their inner femininity, and how non-binary isn't a third gender and it is just how they experience gender, meaning it is a fluid concept that isn't strict with labelling and other such things.

I was wondering if people who are AMAB are as popularly considered valid as lesbians (if they choose to label themselves in this way) as they may not have as much inner femininity to draw upon having been raised male (aware here that not every AMAB nby has been raised as a male child, and some have known from an extremely young age.) 

Connected to this, pronouns don't equal gender, yet many say that he/him lesbians are not valid or considered lesbians. I suppose i find the way pronouns, gender and sexuality intertwine when somebody isn't strictly on the gendef binary. I'm sure I'm not the only one - I'm still figuring myself out. How come he/him people cannot be called lesbians if they/them people can? What about people that use he/she/they, or he/they?

I’ve always hung out with the boys in school, and when made into two groups for activities for school  I would always contemplate going to the men's side. I would always chose the girls side though, because I was scared people would see me as weird, or the teachers would call me out. But it was never anything intense, or anything tjay dostressed me too much. 

Ive always felt something is wrong with me, like something was missing, or something not there- I just never felt whole, y’know? I’ve never felt happy with myself, I always felt so strange. Like I was never myself. I’ve had bad issues with mental health, and have been to the hospital twice. Whenever they ask me what’s wrong, I have no words. I don’t know what it is, I don’t know what to tell them other than it is like a black hole in my chest, like dust or fog or smoke that I can't see through. 

I’m scared that I’m just a ‘transtrender’, or that these feelings are fake and I’m just lying to myself so I could have somewhere to belong. I’m scared that I’m lying to myself, and that I’m just making these feelings up, that it’s just me forcing myself to feel bad and call it dysphoria. 

I don’t like my chest. It feels bad, everytime I look down, I feelt bad because I don’t qant them there. It’s like they label me with something I don’t feel. I don’t feel like a “woman”, I don’t want to be a “woman”, I want to be me. I just want to be me, without judgement. I love stereotypical “feminine” things, like clothing, pastel colors, cute things. I’m not really “manly” or anything, and I could never see myself that way. I love being feminine, I just don’t like being called something I’m not because of that. 

I found a name I liked, Oliver. It made me really happy, even though no one has called me it in real life. And he/him makes me feel pretty good too. I was gonna write she/her doesn’t make me feel bad, but as I read it to myself, it feels pretty uncomfortable. 

I don’t really know if I actually have dysphoria or not; I have a feeling but I’m not sure what it is. My bottom area doesn’t bother me much, I probably wouldn’t change anythingdown there because I just feel what I have is more convenient, and there are packers and such. But my chest- I know there are binders, but something about my chest puts me off. Everything I look down I feel this horrid sense of dread looming over me. I want the, gone. I do not like them. I don’t want to be seen as a female because of them. I want to be seen as a boy, I want to see myself as a boy, I want to be a boy because that's what I feel inside. And I just hate my chest, I don’t even want to look at them or acknowledge their existence because I truly just hate them. 

I get waves of doubt, constantly. For a minute like above I’ll be confident of what I want, and the next I’ll be questioning everything. Over and Over again. It’s the most frustrating thing. And I know things take time- but- I just want to know, I just want to relax and rest easy with knowing who I am. I’ve been questioning myself for a few months 6-7 at least.

I argued that he was being disrespectful and invalidating all the Trans community but he says he was just being “realist” and that “just because they say to themselves and claim they are woman doesn’t mean they truly are”.

And he later started saying that he couldn’t understand why I was so affected by this and that’s when it really hit me I just started having a breakdown over why I was so affected and angry and emotional about it.

I consider my self to be bisexual (still closeted) and I struggle constantly with my sexuality and don’t fully come to terms with it, the idea of being trans or Non-binary or just no Cis in general had crossed my mind but after thinking about it I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t because I had never had body dysmorphia, felt uncomfortable considering or referring to myself as a man or anything of the sort, the only thing I thought was “if I could become a woman for a day I would to experience it and experiment in it” and thing like that but never anything permanent and if given the chance to be permanently a woman I would probably not do it (or at least I think I wouldn’t). So I brushed that idea off.

But now after all that fight with my dad I was arguing with myself over why I really was so affected by it and I said to myself “maybe I am trans and that’s why”, but I never felt like one or anything like it so i am very confused and that kinda led to an emotional breakdown (sort of, I have a lot of thing going on in my life emotionally like my parents divorcing and my dad moving out, my grandma moving into a nursing home because she has Alzheimer's, among other things).

I was kicked out of my moms house a week ago after weeks of being out to them and putting up with their homophobic and transphobic bullshit and talking to the 3 people who I’m out to they kicked me out. The reason, religion. Last Friday I went to pick up the remainder for of my things and my mom made me sit through an hour of her reading the Old Testament tale of sodom and gamora and telling me how I am a stain on this earth while she turns around and tells me that I’m welcome back when I’m “normal” again. I’m just sick of this of everything.

I'm not white or black--I'm south Asian but sometimes get mislabeled as black or fetishized as some ""exotic brown girl."" But this fetishization, while unpleasant, is rare. I'm here more to talk about how I've been made to feel worthless, ugly, and as an imposter due to my skin color.

When I first was exploring my trans identity and asked for help from other transwomen, they routinely called my skin ugly, saying that they didn't know how makeup would make it look better, and in some cases, some of these 'friends' just straight up blocked me after saying they didn't think makeup existed for people of my skin tone, shaming me and making me feel ugly that I wasn't white like them. Racism in the makeup industry is a whole issue in itself--ask any woman of color--but the way in which the ideal form of trans beauty as white, tall, and skinny is propagated just depresses and frustrates me.

I've had multiple people question the validity of my trans identity due to my race, when so many white women who transition get unending support and love. It feels like I'm an imposter, and quite honestly Reddit doesn't help when it seems like every transwoman here is white and everyone fetishizes the ""femboy look."" And this affects my romantic and everyday life--mistreatment outside on public transit, at so-called ""queer-friendly bars,"" by other trans people who call me ""chocolate"" or think I'm not American due to my skin color. Racism pervades all aspects of life, and it baffles me how the trans community doesn't realize that they're also not immune to this. 

I'm sick of being made to feel ugly. I'm sick of not being able to find makeup for my skin tone. I'm sick of being told I can't cosplay as my favorite characters because they're white. I'm sick of the ideal standard of trans beauty. I'm sick of the fetishization of tall, skinny, white transgirls which everybody seems to propagate even as they decry it. I'm sick of being made to feel an imposter since I don't fit the trans mold. I'm sick of being that I don't look trans since I'm short, thicc, and not-white.

2021-03-15 15:53:06,m5nqm0,0,1,"TL;DR - was playing a text adventure game that randomly generates content and it randomly generated a feminine name for me (cue gender euphoria!)

\-

Gonna try to keep this short, but Ai Dungeon is a text adventure game where the story is created by an  AI as you go along. So you might type something in like ""I open the book on the table to see what's inside"" and the AI will reply ""You open the book and find some instructions on brewing potions to combat seasickness"". It's usually a little weird and nonsensical, but if you can roll with the weirdness then it's a lot of fun.

The gender euphoria came the other day when the AI did one of its usual mistakes: getting names wrong. It has a funny habit of occasionally distorting or replacing names of characters, sometimes only changing a few letters to outright renaming them. What happened to me was that the AI generated a snippet of dialogue between myself and an NPC.  I put in the sentence ""I've been travelling alone for a long time so some company would be great"" and then the AI generated some dialogue. 

&gt;NPC: ""Well, it's your lucky night then, cause I'm a pretty talkative guy. What's your name?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Lena.""

I must stress that I did not put that name in anywhere else, the AI just picked that name out of a randomly generated hat and threw it into the story. Until that point my character had been nameless but as soon as I saw it I had to keep it. It felt good to just be given a name that sounded decent than go through the tedious process of picking a name for myself (seriously, where do you even start with that?)

My eye brows are on fleek, Im 18 and still get Acne which sucks. \nGenerally i don’t know what to do. How do i look more femme? I’m so sick and tired of  being misgendered because of my face. It is so frustrating. what do you lot do?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Face Disphoria', 'created': 1615862831.0}"

2021-03-16 00:14:52,m5w21q,5,1,"Hi everyone, this was an exchange that happened a few days ago between I, amab trans woman, and one of my friends, who's an afab non-binary person. I've been questioning it since it occurred, but I'm not sure if it's me looking for transphobia after months of subtle transphobia from my rural ""supportive"" conservative family, or if it was just a genuine transphobic incident on their part. I would like some additional perspective and thoughts on this, so I thought I shoukd ask here.

For additional context, both of us live in rural areas, so while not flagrant and super public about our respective identities, we're still semi-closeted. 

I'll be referring to them as D.

We were on my couch when D remarked they needed to shave their legs. 

This bothered me, because repeatedly D has chastised me for the same remarks, telling me ""Girls have leg hair too"". When I pointed out their hypocrisy, D responded that it wasn't fair because society doesn't expect me to do so, and then proceeded to lament how much they disliked being a woman in modern society, mostly on how much control of their body is dictated by men. 

I felt a little attacked, because D finished their rant saying that ""being a woman isn't some greener grass on the other side"" and it made me feel even worse. 

I didn't say anything after that because I don't like confrontation with my friends, but I don't want any transphobia to just go with no repercussions.

2021-03-16 02:58:52,m5zf72,0,1,"HELLO WONDERFUL HUMANS!!!! 

A while ago I posted about my little sisters best friend who plays video games with us who would have male presenting avatars but would switch them when we’d come around or felt like they had to justify them. Idk if anyone remembers but I was trying to help bring up the topic with them in a way that would make them feel ok. 

And update!!! They came out as Bisexual to me a few months ago and when they did we spent time talking about sexuality and gender. 

Well anyways long story short today they told me verbatim that they just prefer using sometimes girl presenting avatars and sometimes boy avatars but sometimes they don’t really feel either and that’s just what they feel and they are trying not to stress about it cause sometimes it makes them feel bad and overwhelmed and they just found out what they pronouns are and they prefer they/them. 

I am sooooo happy they opened up!! I’ve spent this entire time since my first post bringing up subtle things like all of you suggested and I think it really worked considering our talk. They did ask me questions like why are players making their avatars really girly but have on their head they/them and I kind of panicked. I really didn’t know wtf to say other then well we don’t know them or their gender identity or their story and I don’t think dressing up more feminine takes away from being non-binary or being able to use the pronoun just like you do and feel so if that’s their preferred pronoun just use them and if you want maybe just ask them if you feel the need to (kinda panicking that the asking will trigger some dysphoria in another kid maybe this was the wrong move on my end fml) but anyways they asked me again “if they are Non-binary then why is their avatar very girly SUPER girly”


As an unknowing cis female I fucking panicked I mean my heart is still racing. I told them about my friend who was gender queer and said that some days they felt more feminine and other days more masculine and then about my gender neutral friend who prefers neither but I really don’t know. I was guessing at this point. I didn’t wanna fuck it up and it just goes to show how ignorant us Cis people are even when we consider ourselves allies. I really feel this kids being cheated that a cis lesbian is their only outlet for figuring out their identity because it’s a life experience that is completely and utterly foreign to me. 


Anyways any suggestions on what I actually should’ve said or should know? I appreciate anything at this point and if I am incorrect about anything I wrote please please please tell me and explain


I know maybe I seem crazy but my little sis is my world and I’ve watched her best friend grow up. I wish someone would’ve been there for me when I was figuring out my sexuality and had none supportive parents. I can’t imagine being an 11 year old trans kid with none supportive parents and no examples truly. I don’t wanna be another adult that looks away. I don’t wanna watch them drown. And I think this is important to the best friend but also is important for my sister to know that trans people exist and it’s a process of figuring yourself out and we should support everyone on their journey and that’s just what I hope for both of them.

2021-03-16 03:16:07,m5zqq9,1,1,"Hi! As the title says, I just joined this group in hopes to learn even more about the community of people on here and figure out how I can be an ally and provide support where it’s needed. 

I recently had a conversation with someone who identified as M2F (or is it T? I’ve seen both!) and had just started hormone treatment. I had so many questions and they were amazing and educated me on so many different things since I had never met someone who had just started transitioning and was open to talk about ( to clarify, it is such a personal topic and I did not initiate it, I followed their lead in terms of what topics were okay and not okay!).

Eventually she joked about having to learn how to put her hair up in a pony tail once it was long since she had never had hair long enough to do one, and I realized she was genuinely unsure. I showed her how I put my hair up, and then easy tricks for messy buns etc. it was so cool seeing someone get to rediscover a whole other world that they’ve been so ready to be part of. 

It got me thinking about all of the other people who have questions that they may feel weird asking about, or may not feel comfortable seeking out someone to help, and how much a bit brother big sister program, which matches up people who are beginning their transition/are at any stage but haven’t had success finding help with another person cis or trans, who feels experienced in the physical aspect of their gender, and can be a big sibling who answers any questions they may have. 

I’ve looked online for this type of organization, as well as searched through this subreddit, but haven’t found anything official. So, why not start something? 

This would be an amazing way to connect all of us even more, provide a safe refuge in the form of an accepting and loving person, and hopefully improve quality of live for a very vulnerable demographic of people. 

I live in Houston, so if any of y’all know of an organization/non profit like this that already exists, please let me know because I would love to join!

Almost 10 years ago, I began writing a novel about a man who takes on different identities throughout his life, and at one point, they present themselves as female, for a short period of the time. This character also deals with lapses in reality, and is strongly suggested to feel guilty of committing a murder (ambiguous) throughout. None of the character’s actions has anything to do with a hatred of self, rather they view themselves as a chameleon of sorts, and it is society’s pressures to an ideal that attributes to their mental spiral. 

I am a cisgender bisexual woman. When I began this book, I really wanted to present the fluidity of gender, identity, and sexuality in conflict with the time period (it is set in the 70s to late 90s) and the stigma that existed back then in finding oneself. At the time I began this book, I felt like I had a blank canvas to tackle these issues, and felt like I had a very progressive narrative to deliver. Writer’s block struck me and I was three quarters through until now, when I have finally experienced a surge of creativity.

But now I’m questioning if I should even finish this novel. I do not want to cause any harm to the trans community, all of you whom I respect and admire dearly. The voice I created was seeded in such a taboo time, but now I feel like the tide has turned, and the trans community is finally getting representation in media. And throwing in my voice when there are trans authors writing about their actual real experiences, feels unwelcome to say the least. 

But also, I do feel proud of what I have written, and before I just abandon it, I want to reach out to you folks outright how you feel about a cis woman writing about an experience I haven’t personally experienced. As a writer, I’ve always felt strongly about the freedom to explore characters of any sex, gender, race, walks of life, but also doing so in a way that respects the voices of those I borrow.

2021-03-16 07:11:06,m63aap,1,1,"hey all. ive seen some beautiful things on here, and many beautiful people. i have also seen a few stories about how their transitions went, and i wanted to share mine. ive always been stealth, since the beginning, so ive never told my story to anyone.

it all started when i was 7 or 8. i was in my mom's room and she was sorting through old clothes and such from when she was about my age. she pulled out this really pretty red and white strawberry dress, and said, ""ooh! i loved this one! i wish i could have a daughter wear this!"" immediately, my dumb kid brain spurted out, ""why don't i wear it?"" without any thought as to how this would change me, although this wasn't a bad thing. she looked at me for a second, then the gears started going. she knew, i was truly a girl. i had shown signs ever since i could speak. she said that i would always say that i was a girl, and that i always had long hair. 

i put on the dress and loved it. not because it looked good or anything, but because it felt good. it felt better than male clothing, it felt so free and airy. i hadn't realized yet, but my brain knew. it knew that this is what i was meant to be. a few months later, around march, i wore a dress to school for the first time, the same strawberry dress. none of my friends cared, they were too young to think that it was weird or bad. all my friends didn't care one bit, and it was relatively easy. even my teachers were fine with it, and started adjusting to my new pronouns. i was born with a gender neutral name, although to this day i really want to change it. anyway, i had one problem, my principle. she really didn't like it. she started to call my mom and say very awful things, and that she was forcing me to change. luckily, i was in the second grade and i was going to a different school by the third (there were two schools right next to each other, one meant for k-2, the other for 3-6.) my new principle was much better.

from there on, less people knew, and i had gone stealth by late third grade. i was just a girl, and my teachers and friends didn't care one bit. one teacher was particularly nice to me, and he immediately though i was female, he's still my favorite teacher to this day. (shoutout to mr shin!) he did slip up during sixth grade graduation and accidentally used male pronouns, but i was cool with it. he had been standing up there all day and it was very hot that day. i was one of the last students called, so he was practically melting and it's totally acceptable for a small slipup. he apologized profusely and sent multiple emails apologizing. 

anyway, middle school was very good for my transition, since i partially looked the part and had very few old friends in the middle school. there was a large problem though, one of my old classmates had gone to the school and totally fucking outed me to like 5 people mid-class. i wanted to deck him so fucking hard. it took multiple months, but we tracked down each of the students and my counselor did *something* to them, which just made them not care anymore. to this day, i have no idea what she did, honestly she could've brain washed them, it worked really well. 

i started blockers in early eigth, and started estrogen sometime in ninth. it took some time for changes to occur and they were unfortunately very unnoticeable. im hoping that i just have a small dose or something, and that they'll up it soon enough. right now, im just waiting till i turn eighteen so i can get my bottom surgery.

To put it one way, if there was a button that would magically transform me into a girl (and have it so everyone else remembered me as always having been so, as to not deal with any social consequences) I would most likely press it even if I couldn't turn back, but I don't particularly feel uncomfortable being male (though I've thought about getting laser hair removal so I stop growing facial hair), most of my interests are traditionally male, but not exclusively by any means (Videogames, Computers, Shounen/Seinen Anime/Manga, basically most of the stuff you'd expect a nerd to enjoy), and if I stayed Male for the rest of my life, it wouldn't make me depressed or anything (I mean I am, but that's because I can't afford college, don't want to take out student loans, and now feel like I'm wasting my life away because I can't financially support myself on part time jobs, and as an epileptic I have been wary of driving. Basically nothing related to being trans) Because of that I don't think I'll ever actually transition unless it actually becomes extremely simple and cheap.

I'd even mostly pushed the thought out of my mind, but last night I had a dream I was back in High School, but I was a girl, and when I woke up I felt a bit sad that it wasn't real.

Also I feel like I related to one of the characters in the manga Shishunki Bitter Change, which is a body swap manga where they swap as kids, and grow up in each others bodies. The ""male"" character (Yuuta) doesn't seem to have significant ""dysphoria"" (at least not nearly as bad as the ""female"" character (Yui) and I feel like if I were to have a female body I would not feel dysphoria (for clarification I was using their original names, and what they and one other character call each other, it's a really good manga up until the last few chapters, but unfortunately is only available through... unofficial means, but if sailing the high seas is something that you're alright with I highly recommend reading it, I'd link it, but while I don't think it would violate any sub rules, I don't want to risk it)

Also Also I find myself reading a lot of Yuri (GL) manga and wishing that I could be a lesbian. (And also find myself playing a female character in games that let me, so long as (assuming it has one, if it doesn't I just pick a female) I'm still able to romance at least one female character (Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Stardew Valley, I'd say etc. but I can't think of any other games that I've played that let you)

I'm not sure if I'm making any sense, but I just kind of wanted to vent and get some kind of feedback, but I don't want anyone I actually know to see this (I know a few people who probably wouldn't judge me, but since I don't think I'm actually trans I don't want to say anything since it will inevitably make them see me differently, even if it isn't in a way that would ruing our friendship), hell if it wasn't for the rule that makes it so new accounts are unable to post I probably wouldn't be using my main account, and since I am I imagine I'll delete this post in a few days, or

She has an obsession with the 1950’s, dresses and acts like she’s from that time period, and clings to the belief that modern women should still live in that time period. Including the believe that women deserve fewer rights, should be subservient to husbands, etc. 

I have no qualms with the way she wants to dress or the things she likes, it’s quirky but totally fine. But the actions and things she says are unbearable. A lot of people stare, others become noticeably uncomfortable as well, and she wonders why she isn’t treated the same way that I am. I’m very hesitant to introduce her to my other female friends because of this. It’s a conversation I’ve tried to have with her many times, but she always seems to revert back to her old ways.

I don’t want her to think I’m picking apart her personality or criticizing her, but considering her circumstances and the way the 1900’s were pretty cruel to anyone that wasn’t straight and white, I don’t understand how she can feel so strongly that women should have fewer rights.",trans,"I want to be supportive of my MTF friend, but she acts like a caricature of women in public and it makes myself and others uncomfortable.

I had a dream about hanging out with this trans guy a lot. In the dream he started stammering on about us and how much fun he has when he’s with me. He then starts to shyly and nervously ask me a question. I remember him stuttering like “do you um, uh, idk, y-ya know. W-w-want to uuuuh”. I stopped him and just bluntly asked him “are you asking if I want to be your GF?” “Uh, um, yes. Actually, that.” “Yes. I do.” Then the dream was him and I being elated in our newfound relationship with each other. He was my BF and I was his GF. We liked calling each other that over and over. 

The dream was interesting to me because I mostly view myself as a lesbian but occasionally fool around with guys but never gain an emotional attraction to them. I think what made the idea possible in my mind is that he would understand a lot of my own problems in life. 

I guess I’m more bi than I thought? Idk. I don’t really wish to dissect my sexual attraction. I just know it’s diverse. I guess I am attracted to men and women. 

But more importantly I think this dream was helpful because it lets me know what I want from a partner in the future. A partner who is caring, fun, and most importantly, understanding of me and who I am. I view all of this as a moment of growth for myself. I struggle with romantic relationships and keeping one that is right for me. I think that dream helped me realize I’m healing from a lot of emotional and mental scars from years ago. I may not have a partner right now, but I know I will some day. I didn’t feel depressed or upset that I woke up alone and without “my dream man😍”. Instead I woke up and thought “that was really nice. :)” 

I’m starting to realize being alone is not a bad thing and is healthy at times. I used to hate being single but now I enjoy it. And I’m glad to see that my subconscious is also reflecting what I consciously say and think.

Shortly: my transition started some months ago. I went for the first time to a gender clinic in oct 2020. I'm waiting for the dysphoria sentence (from a psychiatrist of the clinic) and I'm just here, chilling with my gender and such.

The main focus of this post is: femininity. Cis guys, as far as I've seen, have a very bad relationship with it. It's used as a slur to degrade others, we all know that.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to say that I feel so confident, so deeply connected with my actual gender, that I don't even care being called a girl. 

If someone says that they tought I was a girl, my reply would be something like ""ah thank you, I appreciate that, but I'm a boy"", because I don't feel like it would be an insult. In my mind, it's implied that they thought I somewhat look good? Idk. 

It's not even going to trigger my dysphoria, because I know, for sure, that I'm not a girl and I don't have anything to do with that word.

Is anyone else feeling as I do? I know it might trigger someone, and I apologize in advance, but I feel so euphoric that I need to share this with my trans folks. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole mindset, however, was favored by PierreXo's videos. He's a guy, a straight guy, who's been catcalled and misgendered very often.

*SO, just to clarify it might be very long because it's a semi-rant and also kinda asking for advice.*

Right, so I don't want to take too long explaining, but for context: up until now I identified as genderfluid, but I kept getting this feeling it didn't feel right, so I tried to see how the label demiboy would work for me and I do experience dysphoria, but usually it fluctuates from none/mild to extreme, but that isn't what I mean. Like for example only a certain thinks make me dysphoric from a physically, socially and mentally and this one now apparently belongs to the physical one.

  My height never really concerned me much, it was just there and not really something I took into account much,because I didn't feel like it defined who I am or anything like that. My parents are literally the opposites when it comes to that- my dad is freakishly tall and my mum is average or slightly below/above. I knew that naturally of course it's not up to a person as to what their full height is going to be and I didn't really mind that. However I did have a silent wish I would be more on my dad side when it comes to height (didn't necessarily have to be huge, but I wanted to at least be in a nice balance, maybe slightly above average made sense to me). My height now IS I would say a tiny bit above average, but mostly average due to my mother (although I am taller than her by quite a bit I would say). My friends are all different size wise, so I wasn't sticking out or anything (even the opposite, most people were either slightly shorter or taller than me or basically my height). But then I  met one of my best friends currently and she is SUPER tall, which is amazing in my opinion, but I realize because of that sometimes they feel like they are is sticking out, so I don't point it out usually. I would say she is content with her height too. Recently though, I noticed that my height bothered me more and more. My friend group has a wide variety of heights and it's pretty cool, we joked about that often, lightly teasing each other. But the teasing now bothers me more and more and I'm not sure why. I doubt it's my friend's intentions, but especially my tallest friend is slightly getting on my nerves now. They always make the rest of us out smaller than we actually are, because she is so tall and it's mostly jokes, but it makes me feel not only uneasy now, but irritates me. Since I'm afab, she is somehow aware I am not entirely comfortable with my height, but I'm also usually kind of distanced towards it. I might be slightly above average for the standards for afab people, but as a guy it's really hard to not be perceived as small. I don't think it's a bad thing, there's a lot of wonderful shorter dudes I've met, however I feel like it's starting to bother me so personally, because it reminds me further that I would typically be taller if I was amab and that the height I have would be perceived as much shorter than it is, it just makes me feel like I am forever bound to this category of height based on my biological sex and I really hate it. I love joking around, but it's making me terribly upset lately, but I don't want to come off annoyed at just a joke, because all that roasting is just pretend. But also I don't want to perhaps say it outward, because then it'd feel like it's a officially newly confirmed insecurity. But the problem is the more I ignore it the worst it gets. I feel terrible about my reaction, because I can see she's trying really hard to try and make me feel validate about my height, but she accidentally makes it worst.

My friends are all different size wise, so I wasn't sticking out or anything (even the opposite, most people were either slightly shorter or taller than me or basically my height). But then I  met one of my best friends currently and she is SUPER tall, which is amazing in my opinion, but I realize because of that sometimes they feel like they are is sticking out, so I don't point it out usually. I would say she is content with her height too. Recently though, I noticed that my height bothered me more and more. My friend group has a wide variety of heights and it's pretty cool, we joked about that often, lightly teasing each other. But the teasing now bothers me more and more and I'm not sure why. I doubt it's my friend's intentions, but especially my tallest friend is slightly getting on my nerves now. They always make the rest of us out smaller than we actually are, because she is so tall and it's mostly jokes, but it makes me feel not only uneasy now, but irritates me. Since I'm afab, she is somehow aware I am not entirely comfortable with my height, but I'm also usually kind of distanced towards it. I might be slightly above average for the standards for afab people, but as a guy it's really hard to not be perceived as small. I don't think it's a bad thing, there's a lot of wonderful shorter dudes I've met, however I feel like it's starting to bother me so personally, because it reminds me further that I would typically be taller if I was amab and that the height I have would be perceived as much shorter than it is, it just makes me feel like I am forever bound to this category of height based on my biological sex and I really hate it. I love joking around, but it's making me terribly upset lately, but I don't want to come off annoyed at just a joke, because all that roasting is just pretend. But also I don't want to perhaps say it outward, because then it'd feel like it's a officially newly confirmed insecurity. But the problem is the more I ignore it the worst it gets. I feel terrible about my reaction, because I can see she's trying really hard to try and make me feel validate about my height, but she accidentally makes it worst.\n\n~~Does anyone know maybe what I could do?~~"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""Discovered my new insecurity, so that's great."", 'created': 1615937238.0}"

But basically, I consider my goals nonbinary trans femme. Right now I'm masculine but I think that with work I could pass when I want to in the other direction.

To give more details on our project, we are writing about the significance of  processes in gender transitioning, in order to investigate which processes (HRT, gender-affirmation surgery, etc.) play the most significant role for transgender people during their transition. 

We also understand that it is a sensitive topic, especially coming from a perspective where we are neither transgender nor heavily involved in the community. We apologise in advance for our ignorance, and would like to humbly reiterate our sincerity in wanting to learn more about the stories of transgender people, and become more educated in the process:)

So I started to write the long document Im going to give my mother to open up. I don’t think I can handle it verbally. Ive never seen a single time she doesnt get super heated and she never loses a debate. 

Ill give the folder to her and ask her to read all of it before contacting me in any way and I’ll leave the house for a couple hours so she can read it all and think about all these.

My document starts with a medium length letter where I open up and give a short summary of everything. Then there will be a second writing about the religious side of things which is very very important for her, where I will debunk the idea that being trans is a sin. Then I will add some extra religious documents and articles that prove my points, and their translations all made by me, as optional reads.

After that I will put a third and short writing where I will simply refute “God doesn’t make mistakes” idea. Then in a medium length text I will explain what dysphoria and being trans is comprehensively, because chances are she is verrrrrry ignorant. I can count on the dysphoria bible there. I will also add additional legal documents to prove that it is widely accepted that trans folk are not “mentally ill” or “sick” cuz she probably thinks so. 

After all these I will put an emotional final say where I will wish her to accept and love her only daughter. At the end, I will put a painting made by me where her, and her daughter(me) are happy and together.

Basically, I came out to my friends on my birthday in January. But not to family and didn't tell anyone who had any connections with my workplace. 

About a week ago I made a second Instagram account and didn't unlink it from my main email address 🙃 rookie mistake. I intentionally didn't do contact syncing but,  alas i didn't realize my mistake until a random friend followed my new profile. Then I realized i was showing up in everyone's ""follow suggestions"". I immediately changed the email, but, I'm still a bit paranoid its easy to find 🤷‍♂️.

Today I found out that one of the managers at my work, found my female presenting Instagram and has been showing my coworkers! Like wtf. Have some decency. Thought we were ""friends"" but I guess this is just too juicy of gossip to not share. Ugh. Kind of infuriating because now I don't know who knows and who doesn't. And it could spread. But whatever. 

Initially I wasn't really that upset. I've dealt with being outed in the past, but im much more accepting of myself now and a GoT qoute comes to mind.

 ""Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you."" -Tyrion Lannister 

So being exposed like this, eliminates any need/fear I had for hiding myself at work. I'm still pissed at him for treating my personal life like gossip, and have blocked him so he can't ""show anyone else"" but  still. I wish Instagram made it clearer, or had prompts for unlinking personal information. But its on me for not doing enough extensive research. Honestly a single Google search would of walked me through the correct steps 🤷‍♂️

Definitely mild with what I've experienced in the past. Had ex's try and out me to friends after we broke up, they didn't believe her, but it still stung. And then another abusive ex who tried to blackmail me to stay with her, and then still slandered my name when I left anyway. 

I feel like being outed, is a big deal, depending on where you are personally at emotionally with your transition. Like a budding flower, if it's forced open, it'll be traumatic, but the further along your blossoming, the less it really matters. 

Thanks for letting me vent a bit ☺ I'm in a pretty good mood, and generally really proud of myself for how I'm handling this news so don't worry about that! It's still bullshit tho. Like, it's not like he followed me (so I knew he knew) or messaged me about it. He literally  ""found out"" and is showing people because it's ""exciting gossip"" 

Outing people is wrong,  and can be incredibly damaging! How/why people are so insensitive is beyond me. And I don't even mean just about trans people, I mean being insensitive in general. Alot of trash, selfish, inconsiderate people out there. But I'm convinced there's wayy more good people. There has to be..

EDIT: if anyone wants to follow 4 follow. My IG is ""Daralynn007"" 

TL;DR
 
Instagram outed me by suggesting to a manager at my work that he ""follow"" my alt account were I present as female. I found out when my coworker told me that he showed my profile  to him. And it pissed him off that this manager was showing my private life as gossip for no reason at all (he's a good friend for telling me tbh) 

I've been outed before, from resentful ex's, and attempted blackmail. But this is the first time there's been literal ""proof"" leaked. I'm out with friends, but not with family or with work. I just started HRT and wasn't planning on working there forever, so I never planned on coming out there. But whatever. I'm upset at this unethical manager, but not really upset at being outed tho.

2021-03-17 11:00:42,m6xv92,1,1,"Hi. So this is something I'm conflicted about. I have a name that I like and go by, but there's another name that keeps hanging out in the back of my mind. It's the name my mom would have given me if I had been amab. I was going to pick this name, but then it hit me that it's my friend's deadname, so I picked my current name instead. 

However, my girlfriend once called me by this name and it made me incredibly euphoric and I can't stop thinking about it. 

I'm a trans guy, and my classmate is a trans girl. The name is very common, so it wouldn't be like I'm stealing a name that her parents made up or anything like that. I (periferally) know a few people with that name. It has a sweet and slightly nerdy normal-guy vibe.

Me and my classmate are not super close, but we have two classes together (which is honestly a blessing. Just going to class and knowing I'm not the only trans person is great, and class discussions with her are very fun bc we both have unique views on things like gender, which we often discuss in class) and I'd say we are friends, but mostly because we're both trans and have a few similar interests. We don't really see each other outside of class and we don't text or anything. Also this isn't relevant but I think I had a brief crush on her last year when I was single.

I considered asking her about this whole thing, but then I decided against it since she probably doesn't want to talk about her deadname.

So far I've thought about changing it in a few years when we aren't in the same class anymore, but for now I really want to take a version of the name as my middle name (it has a few variations and different spellings). 

Would it be rude to take a variation of this name as my middle name? The specific variation is just the name with an O at the end, and it would just be on official papers (including the class list, which everyone in class can access). I wouldn't go by my middle name, and it wouldn't be the exact same name.

Should I talk to her about it? 
I was thinking of asking her permission sorta, but that might be weird.

2021-03-17 12:26:04,m6z8zd,13,1,"Hello guys! 

I’m not trans i’m gay but i recently had a very bad thread/conversiton in the lgbt community reddit so i got banned from there. I didn’t mean to offend anyone so i’m a bit confused now and i need an opinion from you guys.

First of all, i know that i used some harsh grammar in the first part of the thread which i regret.

The thread was about some internal problems in the community which concerned me for a time. Me and many people felt isolated or not represented anymore by the lgbt community becouse of different opinions or imbalance in representation.
I stated that since i see almost only trans posts in the lgbt community i feel isolated and separated, and asked how could we solve this problem without separation.

I want to state here that i don’t mean in any ways to talk against trans people!!! I only said that i want more representation (as gay) becouse i can’t idetfiy with the problems that trans people have, becouse those problems are completely different from mine. I also stated in the original thread that those problems (trans) are just as valid as mine or any other part of lgbt probelms.

After this part i addressed the main problems that concerns my subcommunity (oversexualisation, superficiality, safe sex probelms).

I got called transphobic, and offensive, and however i replied to almost every comment i could to state that i’m not in any ways in favor of separation, eventually i got banned permanently from the community.

I feel even more isolated now, becouse my own community couldn’t care about my problems, and addressed my problems bad problems, or not as valid as theirs. I also feel more isolated and ASHAMED, becouse i called transphobic, when i don’t feel like that, since i care a lot about those problems too in my own country.

Please tell me if i did something wrong, or is it really offending to you. And if i am, why is it transphobic to state these problems?

I love you guys.

2021-03-17 14:47:40,m721my,0,1,"Hey all,

My name is Isabelle, I’m m2f just starting my transition.

I’m relatively secure in my sexuality, I identify as omnisexual.
I do not find butch burly manly men attractive.  But very feminine people identifying as male could be a possibility.  I’ve never even kissed a boy, I just know that for the right person I’d be willing.  

I’m in a very happy, loving and supportive relationship with a CIS woman.  I have no issues with the relationship, I’m very attracted to her.  So this isn’t a post where I’m subtly inviting DM’s etc.  

Since my egg cracked though, I’ve started noticing trans men in a more sexual way.  
It makes no difference to me how masculine and macho they are, beards, tattoos, muscles or very androgynous are all good, if he happens to be trans I really don’t mind.  I just don’t feel the sense of risk from trans men that I do from cis men.

Now, I know that this is all in my head.  A man is a man, other than the fact we are both trans and might understand each other a bit better, I can’t really see any reason to have that preference.
But I have definitely seen some trans men and been very attracted to them, yet the same doesn’t happen if they are very similar but cis.
I suppose I’m a little worried that I could be perceived  as a chaser?
Or worse, that subconsciously I still see them as women (must point out that I don’t, I’m just worried about unconscious bias) 
But also, I’m assuming this must be pretty normal?  

I would never want to fetishise or come across as creepy or offensive to anyone, I also fully expect that this is quite common and would be keen to hear from the community how it’s viewed and best handled.   I know I have internalised transphobia and self hatred to work on, I’m just keen to understand my feelings and identify anything that requires a little more introspection or action from me rather than risk spreading negative energy out among my people. 


Thanks

I've got some (mens') fashion knowledge after taking some classes, pretty confident in it actually. One of the prevailing lessons I picked up is dressing for your age bracket. Younger adults and teens look better in brighter colours, statement pieces, and can get away with bolder choices. Approaching middle age, it becomes more aesthetic to 'dress like an adult.' Dress for class, not statements; darker colours, clothes with shape. Dress sharp, rather than bold.

My understanding for womens' fashion is the same, how you can dress to look good changes based on your age bracket. There is more variety, but generally you want to 'class up' rather than 'be cool' as you age.

The issue for me is that I'm not getting much younger over time, none of us are. But as someone who started recently questioning, the outfits and looks that really interest me are those bolder, brighter looks. Older teen, young 20s fashion.

Will this be an issue? I am lucky enough to not be in 'the game.' No need to look good for anyone but me, but the cognitive dissonance is there, and I'm worried about it.
