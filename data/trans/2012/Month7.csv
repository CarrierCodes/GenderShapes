2012-07-16 09:34:21,wmxo6,11,8,"So, I'm using a throwaway because I know a bunch of my real life friends know my Reddit username; and I'm not sure if I want to come out or not. I've felt like a 'girl' my entire life, but I have such a husky male body that I have no idea how it would turn out if I were to transition; I also have so many questions about transitioning, and if a few of you could help me out, I would be more than appreciative.

1. Do hormone supplements/testosterone blockers begin to make the body more female? Like, do breasts begin to grow and hips and curves and all that? I have no experience with such things and I'm very curious as to how effective they are.

2. Does a full transition include surgery for genitalia reversal?

3. How long would you have to be on hormone supplements until surgery can be performed?

4. Is there special kinds of plastic surgery to get 'features' that would make you appear more female than you would without it? (I'm not really sure what 'features' mean, I suppose curves and such.)

Now for my specific situation, that I definitely need help on. I have no idea if I should come out to my parents, I am current 18 years old and live with my parents, and work at the same company my parents work at; my dad is a 'firm' enough christian for it to worry me that he would attempt to kick me out at the first mention of it, and my mom I fear would have a breakdown due to mental disorders she has. I make enough money to scrape by every month on my own if I had too, but then again, I don't have health insurance, so I don't know if I would be able to afford the hormone supplements monthly. Any advice for this would be very very helpful.",trans,I need a bunch of help x_x,1342456461.0,"{'created_utc': 1342431261, 'id': 'wmxo6', 'num_comments': 11, 'score': 8, 'selftext': ""So, I'm using a throwaway because I know a bunch of my real life friends know my Reddit username; and I'm not sure if I want to come out or not.

2012-07-21 11:12:22,wx4u7,1,3,"**TL:DR - my receding hairline is going a little red under Regaine. What does that mean?**

Hey all,

I'm a 25 MTF woman who has been on a low dose of oestrogen for about 9 months.  Right now I'm worrying about my hairline; it's a long way (~4 inches) behind where I want it to be.

I'm meeting my doctor in just under a month (Grr, underfunded NHS) and I'm pretty sure they're going to up my oestrogen and possibly start blocking my testosterone which should lead to some regrowth.  In the meantime, I'm using Regaine 5% Foam on my temples and on my crown.

My temples are looking a little red and spotty as a result - nothing anyone but me would notice or comment on, but I would like to know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  I know Minoxidil isn't that effective on temples but it's the only thing I can think of to do.

Any advice appreciated!",trans,Minoxidil/Regaine Advice,1342894342.0,"{'created_utc': 1342869142, 'id': 'wx4u7', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""**TL:DR - my receding hairline is going a little red under Regaine.

2012-07-31 18:41:33,xgnbg,4,3,"I've been on hormones for 13 months now. HOLY FUCK it doesn't feel like its been a year, I can still kinda remember the first time taking my in house pharmacy acquired pills. 

Since then I've gotten in with an endocrinologist who has been taking care of me. It has been an awesome experience and with her medical care I've excelled a lot.

My skin is even softer then it was when I was on the IHP stuff, my breasts have shot up another cupsize (I'm close to being a full C) my belly fat is moving out, and my face has changed a lot. 

Shes even been able to help me with my diet based off my blood tests. Telling me specifically what things are affecting my unique blood system. So my weight has finally started to peel off after I plateaued from losing over 100 pounds. 

Every 3 months though, she changes my dose, adjusts brands, sets up a different pattern. 

And it seems like for the first month after these changes, my body and brain goes nuts. I guess this is what having a finally normal female hormone range does, I'm feel like I'm crying all the time for the silliest things. 

Not a depressing cry, but a ""awe so beautiful"" or ""dear god this make sense now."" type cry. 

My hormones have been affecting me emotionally and romantically though too. And right now I think I've scared off one of my Significant others with how I've been acting. She specifically claimed I was ""Acting like a 14 year old girl."" Which I guess I am. 

Right now though, My stomach is turning, I'm guilt ridden, and I feel like I want to vomit. 


I thought this was all over with when I normalized the last time I visited the endo and got an adjustment. But you can't really expect a sudden change of brand, dosage, diet, and exercise, to not make you go crazy. 

I just wish I had more control over it, I don't want to keep losing loved ones every 3 months.
