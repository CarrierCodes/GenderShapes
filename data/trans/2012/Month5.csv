I'm a bit wary of straight-up going to only having a few inches of hair and I'm kind of fond of that look some guys have with the hair short on the sides and going down the back of their necks, but I'm not sure if I can pull it off or not.

I've also read that slight differences will accentuate different features and that it can make the difference between looking like a guy and looking like a girl with short hair, so should I make a point of tossing in a few more dollars to go to a better place the first time to make sure they get it right?

I'm going to come out about being a girl.
And after a day of thinking about it, this will likely be the hardest thing I'll ever have to do.
For those of you who have never had to deal with this or thought much into this, this is essentially what it's like: I'm changing what has been ""me"" for 16 years, into something drastically different, physically. And my entire life will change, as will EVERYTHING else. Many of my friends will leave me. The remaining friends' parents will be freaked out. I'll be the only transitioning person in my school. It gets confusing. What bathroom do I use at school? What do i tell people when they ask what I am, what I'm becoming? How will I deal with the stares and cruel questions of all of my classmates? What about in my own home? How will I deal with my father, who is already impossible enough to live with; now I'll just be another sick freak to him, and nothing more, which doesn't bother me, but just gives him more fuel to pick on and mock me with.
How does one just suddenly go from being a boy to a girl in the eyes of everyone they have known?
Coming out like this doesn't just happen once. It happens over, and over, and over again, constantly, ad nauseam, until everyone who thought you were a boy knows. Who knows how long that will take. And I don't think I can do it.

2012-05-20 15:22:32,tw1i1,6,8,"Last night I performed an orchiectomy on myself.  I did alright I guess, seeing as I'm alive enough to type this off my phone in bed.  I fucked it up though.  I lost grip on my left artery and it went up into my inguinal area so I wasn't able to cauterize it.  I bled internally all night.  It really hurt.  I didnt have pain meds and just cried and moaned all night till exhaustion took me.  A friend came by with Tylenol with codeine and I have a stash of anti-biotics if things go south.

I will have PTSD from this.  It was traumatizing, painful, and stupid, I almost bled to death. 
 I'm a pretty hot trap and honestly think I would have preferred to sell my body for the funds to get this done right than to have gone this route.  I've hurt my partner very deeply through him witnessing me almost dying.  While we are both smiling about it, I worry if our relationship will ever be the same now.

16 hours out and the pain is manageable.  I'm staying in bed the rest of the week.  

Don't try this please... If I hadn't called a friend who's a doctor to help finish stitching me up, I'd be dead.  If you try this, you will regret it and may well die.

Just a sincere word of caution.  I love you genderfucked redditors.  Stay cool... And rational.
