I'm a genderqueer, AMAB, with a sexuality somewhere between lesbian and non-noncommittally queer. In my small, binary-minded community, the fact that I have a penis that I'm still half-heartedly attached to means that most of the queer women I know are very emphatically not into me, usually because they're not into men. Which is all well and good, except...there are lots of self-identified, %100, gold star-wearing lesbians who fawn over transmen. There's no cognitive dissonance for them in declaring that they only like women and then going and fucking someone who calls themselves a man. Who looks like a man. Who acts like a man. Who could drop his pants and show you his vagina and would still be more convincingly-masculine than I am. Maybe I'm so angry because despite how I could probably pass as just an effeminate man if I, say, stopped wearing makeup and women's shoes, I don't, but I'm still assumed to have male-privilege and not allowed to come to ""girls-only"" gatherings, while my transmale acquaintances DO enjoy male privilege from passing and are STILL invited to the sort of spaces I'm probably always going to be barred from.

Some situations that confuse me:

1. When with girls on a couch, I wrap my arm around their waists and hold them. 99% of the time, I would like to be the one being held or lying on a chest.

2. When walking the streets and dangerous-looking persons appear, I automatically move to where I'm between them and the girl. I can't help but feeling that I would prefer being the one protected.

2012-11-19 17:42:27,13gjey,3,12,"Hey - this will be a bit ranty and I'm mostly just looking for sympathy.

I'm 25.  When I was 21 I went to the NHS (UK) to start transition.  Since then they've been the literal minimal amount of helpful to stop me from walking away from them and going private.  First, they sent me a letter telling me to fuck off and die because the local authority was blocking funding for me to even talk to a specialist - way back when I was suicidal.

Since then, since I started living full time as female before I even got to them which the UK forces you to do before they'll treat you, they've had me on incredibly low doses of hormones; they only just started me on 2.5mg of finasteride three months ago, and even then only because my GP is really wonderful and has fought for me the whole way through.

That's four years of my life gone, and they're the years where my body starts to decay into something horrific and irredeemably male.  My mother's side of the family has male-pattern baldness and I have a receding hairline and *it didn't have to happen*, but because the NHS would rather people like us *died* they blocked treatment and slowed it down until my body could damage itself.

They didn't pay for hair removal, they didn't pay for sperm storage (about $600 / yr!), obv. they didn't pay for clothes, they're not paying for minoxidil.  All they're doing is *getting in my way* and *hurting* me, damaging me permanently.

I hate them.  I hate them.

EDIT: Huh, I guess change ""a bit ranty"" to ""very ranty"".  I've calmed down a lot now, but the above was triggered by the NHS writing me a letter to say they've lost yet another set of  my blood tests.",trans,"UK NHS has abused me, feeling lost",1353372147.0,"{'created_utc': 1353346947, 'id': '13gjey', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 12, 'selftext': 'Hey - this will be a bit ranty and I\'m mostly just looking for sympathy.\n\nI\'m 25.
