I have called some of the more well-known doctors here that have experience with treating trans* folk, but have been turned away due to them ""Focusing more on MtF patients"". Since FtMs can't really self med, I'm at a bit of a loss here. I have my GYN appointment on the 30th, y'all think she'd maybe be an approachable physician?

Also, when it comes to insurance, mine doesn't cover anything to do with trans* medical care, is there a way for doctors to use a different coding so it doesn't show up as me having teh trans?

Thanks, again y'all.

Alot's happened. And for a change of pace, I'm not going to talk about it, but something else entirely. Since I and a couple other people are making a new space, however, in light of what has gone on, many might see it as another splinter.

Actually, I'm just writing to let you, and people in every single related subreddit I can find (from the larger r/lgbt to the asexual community), about a new project on its way.

To keep it brief, we have the idea of forming a small Big Siblings program on this site. It would be intended to serve the mentoring needs of all people with non-normative sexualities or gender identities/presentations.

We're still coordinating, but there are a few things worth noting here that are already solid.

None of the moderators of this space will have any affiliation with any moderators of any other space, no crossover or overlap. The polarizing events across multiple boards make crossover inappropriate, especially given the sensitive challenge and special needs of those who would be seeking mentors in the forum.

It won't be a discussion forum. People will be gently encouraged into all the various subreddits available to them, with neither judgment nor preference on our part, to have public discussions as they wish. Our place will be only for collecting posts from those volunteering as mentors and those looking to be mentored.

Finally, mentors will be held to high standards of conduct and verification (though in no way are required to share any identifying information), and as such will never be drawn from those who have made their names by way of polarizing activities, on either side of any particular controversy.

We thought you all here might appreciate being aware of this coming service and space, and welcome questions. Further, if the moderators here deem this post inappropriate, deleting it won't result in any private message fussing or other harassment.

Thanks for your time &lt;3
