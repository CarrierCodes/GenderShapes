Firstly, I am AMAB. But I am a woman. I only admitted this to myself within the last year, after fighting it for far too long. I really want to trans so I can be comfortable and happy as who I am, rather than who I appear to be.  My problem is where do I start? How do I go about this? I have read so much, with conflicting opinions and laundry lists of suggestions, that I am overwhelmed.  My depression has increased ever since I came to this realization because I understand why I have never been happy as I am.

A former 'friend' overheard me talking to a good friend about the fact that I am truly a woman and started spreading it around at my workplace, causing me to get fired. Unfortunately, where I live, they don't have to have a reason, or provide one, for letting you go. So, I have no legal recourse in that area.  This also means that I am broke, as the job market here is absolutely lousy, so I don't have the money to jump into the transitioning process.
(By the way, I apologize if some of my word choices or phrasing offends anyone as I am still new to a lot of things and language in the transitional community is one of them)
I want to present as a woman, but have a rather solidly built, masculine body that makes me unhappy with the way I present when dressed appropriately. This is even more depressing.  
I live in an area that is extremely intolerant, and that makes it more difficult.  I am depressed, and afraid, and excited, and nervous, and second-guessing and doubting myself due to the difficulty and fear.  
I am a bit older than most of the posters I have been reading on Reddit, as far as I can tell, and that makes me worry that I won't be taken seriously.  Even now, I am still debating posting this.  This post probably isn't the clearest, but I am pretty confused and lost myself.  If you have anything you want to ask, to clarify anything, please do.  I will answer to the best of my ability.

TL;DR - I am 38 years old, transwoman, finally came out to myself less than a year ago, broke, unemployed, and don't know where to go/what to do... Help?",trans,"Lost and needing direction.

2012-09-14 08:01:25,zv98l,5,8,"First off I apologize, this is a throwaway because I don't want to alarm my friends who may stalk my other account.

I am a 25 year old male-to-female transitioner. I started hormones at 18. Things have been going well except I've had some stumbling blocks, namely, body-image problems, problems with my weight and self esteem. I'm growing up slowly and getting my life in order, and things are looking up. Unfortunately I've now lost my insurance as I am out of school, and I have not had my prescribed HRT for nearly a year.

My body is starting to become masculine again and I am afraid I won't be able to live this way. I can't afford to pay for the doctor out of pocket, and I don't know how to get hormones otherwise.

I know self medication is a sensitive subject and can be dangerous, but my prescription has not changed since I've begun under a doctor's care. I believe I will be fine, and may even be able to get a doctor to monitor my levels, I just cannot afford to pay out of pocket for the visits and the hormones at this point. I am working on my financial situation to change this.

I come here in hopes that someone can point me in the right direction to getting back on HRT either through some sort of normal channel or online before testosterone changes me permanently. I have started to panic this week because my throat hurts, and I am worried my voice may be deepening more.

Please help me get back on track. Thank you :)",trans,Help continuing my transition.
