2012-12-10 14:25:52,14lrx0,6,39,"To be honest my approach is a little different than the conventional wisdom.


The way I made myself start, honestly, was a trick. I told myself that I'd only do it for a month, and if that didn't work I'd stop. (Taking action was better than second guessing, at that point; sort of like how it's easier to take that first plunge off the high dive if you don't get stuck on the board staring at the water for minutes.) Transition was never a permanent thing for me; I constantly re-evaluated what was happening to make sure it was a good thing.

Instead of setitng transition as an ""Am I a man or a woman?"" question, though, I set it to a far simpler question.

""Do I feel better today than I did before transition?""

This has to be an average, of course. Some days will be harder than others. But I made sure to separate temporary issues (My family isn't handling it well, I don't pass, I wish this would go faster) from permanent changes (Holy hell I look so much better now than I did a month ago, my brain is settling down, I feel calm and happy despite the fact that I have to relearn how to deal with my emotions.) In particular:

-Do I like these breasts? This face? This skin? (Again, don't worry about what people will _think._ That is an externality you cannot control. Had I let my doubts of how my friends would react affect my decision I would not have transitioned, and in doing so missed out on one of the most important experiences of my life.

-Do I like the new mental state? Do I feel giddy at times, happy, pleased, calm? Again, transition may take you to the highest highs and lowest lows, but what is the overall average? Is it better than your past overall average? (I took a daily/weekly tally of how I felt day to day so I could review it - am a bit of an obsessive and a touch analytical when it comes to this. Was a HUGE help, though!)

-How would I feel about going back to being male? This was a hard question to answer sometimes, as transition can get pretty rough, but when I just sat down and was drop-dead honest with myself the idea just didn't feel right. Easier, maybe, but never quite ""right"" in the way that the way forward felt.

-Do I feel _right_? When I look in the mirror do I look more like myself than I did before? Again, this is one of those mushy subjective things. You'll probably agonize over it, and that's okay. But, on average, if you feel more like yourself with each passing day then you're probably doing something right.



Journaling! I can't suggest it enough. Your brain will be stuck in the now and won't see where you've come from, and when you don't have vision on that past you see it through rose-tinted glasses. Taking a journal helps separate your brain's perception from objective fact. Video diaries are especially useful, as you can see changes as they happen. This can serve as a friendly motivational push when you need an image- and confidence-boosting session; I know for the first two years I looked at the old me quite a bit, just to remind myself that things are constantly getting better.


The things I'd warn you about - and suggest that you not worry to much about!

-MTF: Your sex drive will die, yes. Probably for about three months or more. But considering you were having trouble already... is that a bad thing? I know mine started coming back when I was experiencing things from the ""right"" body. (I'm convinced now that sexual orientation, and to a certain degree sexuality, is a two-part equation. One is the gender presentation of the one you want to be with, the other is the gender presentation _you_ want to be when you're with them. This is a huge deal and cannot be understated; in fact, its the biggest ah-ha I had during transition, period!)

(-FTM: Your sex drive will double, at the very least. Welcome to being a guy with teenage-level hormones. :) )

-Girl, or boy? False. You have been sold a bill of goods by the trans community and the folks who do the gatekeeping when you worry about ""Am I a girl or a boy"" semantics. You are you. Your presentation will fluctuate - I was girly-girl for a few years until I settled in as a genderqueer tomboy - and the whole mess regarding a ""true"" transsexual, binary and all, is bullshit. Serious. All that matters is reducing dysphoria. The sooner you realize that this isn't about endpoints and is instead all about a journey, the sooner you'll relax and just start enjoying any transition you have.

-But will I transition fully? Depends on where you set your goalposts. The goal of transition is to reduce dysphoria. Period. If you're not comfortable in your body, you change it. Let the rest of the baggage go re: man or woman stuff. Everything, from hormones to any surgeries, exists only to reduce that dysphoria and make you comfortable in your own skin. You may need to play along at times to get cleared for HRT, sure. But never forget that this is all about the reduction of gender dysphoria.

-Most people honestly do not give a fuck about your gender. Seriously. Repeat that mantra until it sticks. Trans people are gaining visibility and acceptance now, and outside of some invasive questioning (which you can always, ALWAYS say no to!) most folks will just take it at face value. You aren't going to destroy their world, and they aren't going to destroy yours.

-Confidence is key. The whole spectrum of cis genders is such that if you want to fit in, you can. But in order to do so you have to stop acting like you have a dirty secret and start acting like you have control of your on faculties. The _second_ I decided to stop caring about what others thought; the second I stopped hanging on everyone's gender pronouns, hoping for some recognition; the moment I stopped worrying and started _doing_... I passed. Hasn't changed since.


**TL;DR: Transition is equal parts letting go of the male/female gender binary, keeping track of your mood over a long period of time, and learning how not to give a crap what people think of you; and the sooner you get there, the sooner you find out how awesome being trans can be.**",trans,"Unconventional wisdom on transition (4 years, post-op, mtf)",1355174752.0,"{'created_utc': 1355149552, 'id': '14lrx0', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 39, 'selftext': 'To be honest my approach is a little different than the conventional wisdom.\n\n\nThe way I made myself start, honestly, was a trick.

I took public transportation, walked around a very lgbt-friendly area of town, got done Chinese food, it was great. I really think that 75% or so people didn't notice me. The ones that did notice me, *really* noticed. Then I came home, looked in the mirror, realized my makeup was screwed up the whole time, and cried. I took off the clothes and makeup and promptly erased every picture of me I had on my phone. 

So, that was painful. I think I might wait until my hair is longer, some HRT is underway, and maybe ffs before I try to pass again. This doesn't sound like the paths I've heard other trans women taking. I just don't think I can deal with going out again like that.

So what does the group think?

At work there is a family restroom if I really need to go, but everywhere else, I'm screwed. 
When I'm out with a certain group of friends, they watch me, and if they think I need to pee, they pressure me into using the restroom. It's not like it's in the middle of the day, in a very public place, but it still scares the living hell out of me. 
Every time I think about using the restroom, I imagine someone starting something and beating the living shit out of me. I imagine these terrible things that mentally, are unlikely, but my emotions and paranoia force me to hold it. I've gotten multiple UTIs and my doctor is getting fed up with me.
