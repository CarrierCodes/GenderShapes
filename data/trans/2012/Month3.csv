&gt;Hello Friends,
&gt; 
&gt;Spring is upon us and so is the fight to protect the rights of Transsexual, Transgender and gender non-conforming Canadians in Parliament.  I am taking the Gender Identity Bill, Bill C-279,  back into the House of Commons for its first hour of second reading for debate in April.  This Bill has made it through the House of Commons once and I believe that we can do it again.  This Bill would add gender identity and gender expression into the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, this may sound small but this Bill could have monumental changes regarding equality in employment, housing, healthcare, mobility and protection for Trans Canadians.
&gt; 
&gt;We need to stand up and tell the government that the rights of Trans people need to be protected, that we are talking about Human Rights not special rights and that we are talking about dignity that is supposed to be enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The NDP stands unanimous in its support of this Bill and now we are looking for the support of all other Parties.
&gt; 
&gt;Here is what you can do to help:
&gt;-Contact to your MP and tell them how important this legislation is to you.  You can find out who your MP is at http://www.elections.ca/scripts/pss/FindED.aspx?L=e. 
&gt;   (If you can meet with your MP in person it’s a lot harder for them to say no to supporting the Bill)
&gt;-Write to the Minister of Justice and tell him how important this legislation is to you. His contact information can be found here, http://www.robnicholsonmp.ca/contact/. 
&gt;-Write to the Prime Minister of Canada and tell him how important this legislation is to you.  His contact information can be found here,  http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/contact.asp. 
&gt;-Tell your friends, families and co-workers and talk about this issue.  Talk about it on your FaceBook, Twitter, blog, and in your community.
&gt; 
&gt;I believe in The Gender Identity Bill and stand committed to equality for all.
&gt; 
&gt;In Solidarity,
&gt; 
&gt;Randall Garrison, MP

&gt;LGBT Spokesperson for the NDP
