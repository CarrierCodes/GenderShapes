I have no idea if you'll ever see this, but talking to you face to face on omegle tonight really kind of touched me to my core. Seeing everything you went through in your transition, and you seeing me for who I really am... I feel like I just woke up for the first time.

I'm transgender.

Thank you for inspiring me in the short time we talked tonight.

Thank you for really making me take stock of everything.

You didn't have to say anything at all to me, but it's like you knew everything I was going through.

Thank you,

Currently, my best friend is finally getting to start her transition from male to female! She has been on hormones for about 6 weeks now and is the happiest I have ever seen her! We have been friends since I was 12 (Im 25 now). I was with her when she first discovered she was SHE and not HE, She was there when I discovered I was bi-sexual, and I was with her when she thought maybe she wasn't trans, (We both grew up semi-brainwashed by the church as our families where heavily involved in the scene), then there for her to celebrate of course when she realized and fully embraced the she WAS Katy!!! 

I have an unending amount of emotional and vocal support for her, however I suck at being a girl as I am fairly androgynous and that is where I need YOUR help.

I want to buy her first pair of shoes for her upcoming birthday, I have no idea where to start there :( I am worried that asking to measure her feet will offend her as they are a sore subject for her. I think he feet are lovely but she still feels like they are too masculine. How can I get the proper shoe size for her, in the most caring way? I am thinking about getting her a nice pair of black boots, is there anything else I should know when buying shoes for someone transitioning to female? I want everything to be perfect for her, i want her to just slip the shoe right on and have if fit like it should, I dont want her to worry about returning it because it is too small, as that would make her feel bad, as it has in the past?

Do you have any tips for me for buying clothing for her also? I want to make her happy and I want to support her the best way I can.

A year ago, I was with a girl that loved the idea of me more than she loved the reality, and I had to make some tough choices about our relationship. I haven't spoken to her since Christmas day.

A year ago, I thought this might make my mother and I closer and fix our broken relationship. Instead I have a restraining order against her and a new scar on my forearm. Today, as far as my parents are concerned, I'm an orphan.

A year ago, I was scared that I would have to go through this journey alone, or with friends too busy to spend time with me, or too far away. I thought that dating would be difficult. The truth is that the weak weed themselves out (or so I told myself), and I drew the lottery and found the perfect person for me, and she and I have since become engaged and had a private handfasting.

A year ago I struggles with clothes and makeup. Today I put one makeup with ease and all of my clothes make me SO happy.

A year ago I legitimately questioned my ability to survive. Now I do not. I know how resilient I am.

A year ago I couldn't look in the mirror without tearing myself apart, without seeing someone who was absolutely ugly. Now I can look in the mirror and point out all of my favorite parts of me. Sure, I still wish some things would change, and perhaps some of them will. But when I look in the mirror I see someone beautiful, I can finally see ME.

Today, as far as my parents are concerned, I'm an orphan.\n\nA year ago, I was scared that I would have to go through this journey alone, or with friends too busy to spend time with me, or too far away. I thought that dating would be difficult. The truth is that the weak weed themselves out (or so I told myself), and I drew the lottery and found the perfect person for me, and she and I have since become engaged and had a private handfasting.\n\nA year ago I struggles with clothes and makeup. Today I put one makeup with ease and all of my clothes make me SO happy.\n\nA year ago I legitimately questioned my ability to survive. Now I do not. I know how resilient I am.\n\nA year ago I couldn't look in the mirror without tearing myself apart, without seeing someone who was absolutely ugly. Now I can look in the mirror and point out all of my favorite parts of me. Sure, I still wish some things would change, and perhaps some of them will. But when I look in the mirror I see someone beautiful, I can finally see ME. \n\nAnyone who read this, if you have been frightened or scared, or anxious... I promise, it gets so much better.

2017-09-12 21:53:41,6zq8t1,6,14,"I like guys and sex has always been a very important part of my life. I let my desire to be the opposite sex out in my sexual fantasies since I was 11 or 12. I always wanted to be a girl in the bedroom with a guy. Guy on guy never turned me on because I could never picture myself as a guy. 

There is one strong sign of gender dysphoria that has been present since age 4: I have always been convinced that my thoughts and feelings are the thoughts and feelings of the opposite sex and I have always been convinced that what I felt is what the opposite sex feels. 

Another potential sign of strong gender dysphoria: I dream of taking a karyotype test where they discover that I was born with female genetics ( intersex ). 

In my mind and when reading a book or watching  television series I always identified with characters of the opposite sex. 

The conviction that I have the soul of a woman in a male body has always been present. 

As long as I can remember I felt negative or indifferent towards my penis. When I started watching transgender porn I never liked that the trans girl her penis was showing. I always look for videos where her penis is hidden. As soon as her penis pops up I feel alienated from her. I also don't like letting sexual partners play with my genitalia, I would even cry if someone touched them.

Crossdreaming has occured since as long as I can remember. Dreaming of being the opposite sex in everyday situations etc...

I am very offended by homophobia though. I don't know why. Sometimes I wonder if I could be a gay male myself and just be deeply in denial. There are a few things that contradict this: I can't portray myself as a man with another man. It doesn't arouse me and I can't relate whereas with woman plus man I get aroused and feel recognition instantly. 

I don't know if this can be considered dysphoria but facial hair and body hair freak me out. So does having a male body odor because I prefer smelling feminine. 

I internalized a lot of mysogynistic views. I don't want to socially transition because I can have a better career as a man, easier time expressing my opinion etc...

I'm very scared to grow old as a male. I could accept growing old as a woman. 

I can't shake the thought that I might be a gay male deeply in denial. 

I saw a general physician who prescribed me hormones.

Good and bad sides of hormone replacement therapy:

- I like having soft skin
- I like smelling feminine
- I love having softened facial features
- I enjoy the feminine sex drive and orgasms more

Bad:

- I have anxiety attacks since I started HRT
- My breasts have grown too big for my comfort. I like them but I wish they were smaller
- I don't have a lot of energy 
- I have gotten my first episode of dissociation since HRT

Good sides of stopping hormones:

- My life wasn't too bad before I embarked on this journey. I just didn't like having a male appearence. If I stopped HRT I would probably go back to a moderate life with a nagging feeling. Especially now that I tasted femininity.
- The anxiety attacks might stop
- I don't know if the dissociation would stop but it might.

Bad sides of stopping hormones:

- I like my appearence and I would be sad if my facial features sharpened again.
- I would hate morning wood coming back
- There would always be a strong envy towards people with a feminine appearence.
- I would hate if my thought pattern became more masculine again.
- I wouldn't like growing old as a man.
- I feel envy of poster child trans women.


Something strange that could point towards gender dysphoria:

- I secretely wish that I found signs that pointed to me being trans. Not sure if that means something?


I keep wondering if I'm transitioning to be the woman in a heterosexual relationship, I can't shake the thought that I'm transitioning driven by a sexual force.

If I found out that I wasn't trans I would be crushed because my whole life I have been convinced that I was feeling like a girl and the desire to be a girl has always been there. Reading articles that suggest that I might be a cis male end in anxiety attacks: I just can't imagine myself as a male. 

I'm just scared because I read everywhere that if your brain sex is male and you take MtF HRT you will get all kinds of negative side effects on your mind. I don't like to read stuff like that because it feels invalidating and the thought that I might not be trans horrifies me.

2017-09-17 22:56:02,70qwwo,5,23,"Excuse the wall of text, and thank you to the ones who actually read through it.

I grew up in an ultra conservative household, where being gay was a choice, and being trans was kind of a fetish. Strangely enough, my father in his 20s used to cross dress as a way to distance himself from the trauma he had experienced with his mother, and my mother has never really had strong feminine feelings either. My mother wore what was practical, over what was cute, and I was told that what I wanted didn't matter. So I never really developed a style. I just kind of did what I was told.

At 12, I hit puberty hard, and  I didn't want to wear bras, I didn't want to learn how to shave my legs and underarms. It just felt like I didn't need to. Like I wasn't supposed to. My mother never took the effort to teach us makeup, or how to be lady like. My father in his own depression and suppression of his trauma started hitting me.

At 15 I had my first feelings for a girl. She was straight, and didn't like me, but I treated her like my girlfriend anyway, and pretended I was in a cis relationship in the back of my head, even if I couldn't admit my own feelings for her. I knew the other girls in my class thought we were a gay couple, based on the way we acted, her sitting on my lap sometimes, and how I would jokingly call her my wife. Ultimately I think she was bi in denial as her parents were staunchly mormon, and being gay was a sin, and she told me we couldn't do those things anymore.

At 16 I met my current boyfriend of 3 years. At that point, had started questioning my gender, due to the religious compulsion I had to watch people like Ty turner, or chase. I watched transition video after transition video. I was beginning to wonder ""Do I identify with this? Or am I just fascinated with these people?"" 

At 17 I decided I was Nonbinary, in hopes that I could still half ass identify as a girl, and be more masculine. I started buying men's clothes. My bf was more than accepting... but I knew he was straight and transitioning would be a bad idea.

Now at 18, I am sitting in my bathtub... staring at my body, and trying to convince myself once again, that I am not a guy. That I'm not supposed to hate my chest, and that my hips are actually something to be desired. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not feeling dysphoria, even as I am sitting here, loathing the way my body looks.

I keep telling myself it's my parents fault. My parents just didn't teach me how to be a girl, or tried to force me into a rigid stereotype of a girl later, because wearing men's clothes wasn't cool. But I want to be a dude. Maybe it's because I was abused. I want to be a man because I won't feel as weak... No, it's because I have an outsider complex, and have never really felt like I fit. It's me trying to fit somewhere, and just grasping at straws... I'm just bi, and that part I was playing with that girl wasn't because I felt more comfortable being a man in my relationship, I'm just a butch bi girl. So many excuses. I couldn't transition because I love this guy, and hes straight. He would stop loving me. So many reasons I am like this but I shouldn't transition...

I know the truth. I know I'm a man... I just can't accept it.

From the tree of despair.

And on my long climb up,

Could see more clearly there.

&amp;nbsp;

The view from above,

On that tree’s swollen limbs,

Showed me more than was needed

To dissolve all my sins.

&amp;nbsp;

So I shouted from atop,

“I don’t want to die!”

And when the echoes stopped,

And in the blink of an eye,

&amp;nbsp;

The branch beneath me gave…

&amp;nbsp;

And with the rope like a necklace,

(Now more like a grave)

I reached out for footing,

And found myself saved.

&amp;nbsp;

When I finally stopped shaking,

I descended back down.

I am ready to try,

I am ready right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Still I keep that rope hung,

For my own way to say:

“I’m not ready to die.

Not back then, not today.”

But I'm a child of the 90s and that shit just unfortunately slips out. This girl is my recent friend and weve been developing a good friendship for like 6 months or so and it feels really trivial to me that she'd be upset but trying to keep an open mind so thought I'd see how this community feels ab it. I of course apologized anyway because if she's upset about it it's not a problem for me to apologize and watch that in the future but still...Thanks in advance for any comments.
