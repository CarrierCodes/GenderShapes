2017-10-06 04:15:52,74lbwh,3,1,"Hey all, I've been having certain revelations and I could use some input from those versed in the Trans ways.

I'm 19/m right now, but ever since I was little I was a pretty quiet kid, even when I was full of energy I was never a loud rambunctious boy. I was never really feminine either though, and i've kept a decent air of androgynous about me personality and behavorially. I've never been afraid to have my nails painted or similar.

I think it started when I began dating my trans boyfriend, he opened me up to his world. I always had this strange feeling in my gut when it was talked about. Nothing bad, but I was always a bit envious. Being as out as he was about it, I strangely felt... envious of what I thought was his bravery, but I'm not so sure if it was specifically that. Even talking about it is making butterflies appear in my stomach. I was strangely quick to use the correct pronouns and always be respectful of when he was feeling particularly dysphoric, but I had never had really met a trans person before then. Whereas I think most cis folk would struggle for a couple of weeks.

Anyways, as the relationship wound up, I occasionally passed tumblr posts about being trans and youtube vids talking about it, and I got that same feeling. I can't even describe it wholy as envy, it feels like so much more.

After seeing some trans timelines of trans girls, I think I feel want. Being feminine seems so nice, I feel like it'd fit me more than my masc/androg self at least, however I don't feel any dysphoria I don't think. I like the idea of keeping my genitals the same, but breasts I am completely fine with as well. 

I feel like I am rambling at this point, and this is probably as in-depth as I can really make it. Do you think I might be trans, or just too appreciative of a feminine form?

I'm not sure if i'd be ready at all to come out as such, even though my fathers been very accepting of my bisexuality and i'm sure would be cool with me being a girl, but I just don't have the backbone like my ex-boyfriend. Even in the face of people who'd call him ""her"" and his dead name, he'd clench his fists and bear it.  Even imagining the slightly disconcerted look of my mostly-approving father and/or coworkers after coming out is enough to make me second-guess it all I think.

The thing is, I seem to see most trans people are very ""I knew I was like this since I was little! I'd put on X clothes and joke around with friends that I was X"" but I never had anything like that. tbh I don't really feel like I have a definitive personality, and maybe I'm attracted to this prospect mostly because it'd make me less of a boring two-dimensional person? I'm sure I'd be fine with remaining a male the rest of my life, but that question will always nag me to the end.

I figure im more likely to get a response here.

So first of all im transgender. Im AMAB but have been full time as me for just over a year.
I have been dealing with depression on some level probably since I was 16 or 17. Im 26 now, been on effexor for just over 3 years. Currently on 300mg a day after an attempt at suicide 3 months ago. 

I've been on hormones for around 2.5 years now. As far as I know from my experiences and from friends/ family I pass in all aspects. I do get odd looks sometimes but its impossible to know if thats because of my height (180cm) or if they somehow know im trans just from looking at me, something im terrified is true and other people are telling me otherwise to protect me as its no secret i have very little self confidence or esteem as well as probably being emotionally fraigile. 
For a while now my depression has been really bad. I failed a few classes at the end of last year and ended up taking this year as a gap year. Its hard for me to find any motivation and im constantly feeling tired. While I've been relatively ok during the day over the last few weeks every night i find myself getting fixated on how to kill myself and ever little detail for when i do it. (It's probably when, not if at the moment)
I see my gp, psychologist regularly and are seeing a psychiatrist as well at the moment. 

I just am so over feeling so down all the time and constantly criticising myself and how no what happens i can never just be a normal woman. I cant have kids - ill be infertile by now and dont think i would want to have kids with me as the biological father even if I could - I will never be able to have regular childhood and adolescence as girl, and im basically a failure anyway at this point. Living with mum since suicide attempt and only income is government support. I can't afford to get things that will help at the moment -like more laser- let alone cover basic costs like car service, dentist, new glasses. Even though im living with mum and paying nothing. 
I dont have the energy to get out and go for a walk or try jogging and even if i did i wouldnt feel comfortable to do so as the potential for dysphoria or anxiety being triggered is high. 
I do have good friends but they aren't always available or up for talking about what i need to. No one really asks me any questions about the things im struggling with. 
Yes the therapy ect covers some of it but thats only a small part of the week and leaves a lot of time for me to do something stupid or lock things away inside me to try to deal with things. 

I didn't really know where I was going with this but I feel like venting somewhere different could help.

I do get odd looks sometimes but its impossible to know if thats because of my height (180cm) or if they somehow know im trans just from looking at me, something im terrified is true and other people are telling me otherwise to protect me as its no secret i have very little self confidence or esteem as well as probably being emotionally fraigile. \nFor a while now my depression has been really bad. I failed a few classes at the end of last year and ended up taking this year as a gap year. Its hard for me to find any motivation and im constantly feeling tired. While I've been relatively ok during the day over the last few weeks every night i find myself getting fixated on how to kill myself and ever little detail for when i do it. (It's probably when, not if at the moment)\nI see my gp, psychologist regularly and are seeing a psychiatrist as well at the moment. \n\nI just am so over feeling so down all the time and constantly criticising myself and how no what happens i can never just be a normal woman. I cant have kids - ill be infertile by now and dont think i would want to have kids with me as the biological father even if I could - I will never be able to have regular childhood and adolescence as girl, and im basically a failure anyway at this point. Living with mum since suicide attempt and only income is government support. I can't afford to get things that will help at the moment -like more laser- let alone cover basic costs like car service, dentist, new glasses. Even though im living with mum and paying nothing. \nI dont have the energy to get out and go for a walk or try jogging and even if i did i wouldnt feel comfortable to do so as the potential for dysphoria or anxiety being triggered is high. \nI do have good friends but they aren't always available or up for talking about what i need to. No one really asks me any questions about the things im struggling with. \nYes the therapy ect covers some of it but thats only a small part of the week and leaves a lot of time for me to do something stupid or lock things away inside me to try to deal with things. \n\nI didn't really know where I was going with this but I feel like venting somewhere different could help. So... yeah."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Im almost ready to give up', 'created': 1507378005.0}"

It was a rocky start getting everyone to use the correct pronouns with me, and it took months. But everyone got on board. 

But a couple of months ago all of my old coworkers, the ones who knew me in boymode, have started ""slipping"". Every single day for the past 2-3 months I hear several of my coworkers mess up.

It makes me feel SO disrespected. It makes me think they have been talking about me when I'm not around, using the wrong pronouns. It makes me believe that they don't view me as the woman I clearly am (I have c cup breasts for fucks sake,  the 3rd largest booty in the store, and more hip than most of my cis coworkers. 

I talked to my boss about it. He tried rug sweeping it. So I shut down. I've been kinda pissy with everyone at work. I'm dead inside while at work.

Yesterday I went to my AGM about it after one of my managers did it, and then I heard 2 others do it directly after. I told her how I was feeling about it. I flat asked her what I was supposed to think, feel, and believe about it. She confirmed that she would feel that way too. (I love my AGM because she is the best ally)

Now, in regards to my new coworkers, the 6 that have only known me as a woman... they've never screwed up. I don't get to work directly with most of them, except for 1 of them who has been kinda pissy ever since she found out. 

Half of them I was outed to without my consent. One of them I came out to preemptively.

I’ve been planning on doing this for a long time but it’s Coming Out Day, so what better day to send out a message to all of you beautiful friends. Hey AJ, those are just your initials, I don’t want to post your name. Hopefully I’ll post enough clues to make sure no one mistakes themselves for the recipient and starts to panic! But hey.

Just want to say hey I’m still around, I don’t think differently of you at all, to me you’re still just my friend AJ. Like I’ve said as time went on our friendship I feel has only strengthened.

I know what you’re thinking, but you don’t want to come to me and say it outright, that’s too scary. I don’t blame you, I wouldn’t either. Send hinting texts! Tell me some strange fact about the African Botfly who knows! I know I seem to be taking this lightly but it’s plenty serious to me, plenty of people feel isolated and left in the dark for fear of the judgement they’d receive, it’s a scary place out there and it’s a scary place in your mind alone. I wonder how many times a friend simply reaching out could’ve helped and even saved people. There are people out there who love you and will respect you as they do now, you don’t have to reach out but remember that if you do it’ll all be okay in the end, you’re not alone! You don’t have to tell someone in your life either, tell this reddit! We love you! I hope my vagueness towards either end didn’t force you to come out through exposure and I also hope no one else thought they were AJ. Left some hints! I hope my friend sees this and finally questions whether they are or aren’t in this alone, that they could come out to someone if they wanted.

Yesterday, I tried on some concealer to hide the ""shadow mustache"" I had. My heart leapt again, just like when I wore women's boots or a women's shirt. I didn't go anywhere, I just stayed downstairs with my parents and brothers.

Today, I did the same. Admittedly rather poorly this time, I rushed myself since everyone was home this time. I sat upstairs alone, but happy enough, wearing a pair of the dumbest socks I own. (A pair of black knee highs with two right leg bones outlined in white thread)

Usually i take them off before leaving my room, even for a short time. When i bought them i said I would take the lace off, of which i had no intention of doing and never did. This time though, i was just tired of taking them off and putting them back on every time i so much as needed to pee.

So I went downstairs, wearing the socks with the lace. And my mom, who I'm not out to made a joke to my dad. (who I'm also not out to)

""Look it's Frank N. Furter.""

-for anyone who doesn't know, this is a reference to the Rocky Horror Picture show, in which the mad doctor is (at least in the original) a transvestite in the most stereotypical way possibly.

I should be used to the off color comments and such, after all we poke fun at each other all the time. But this hit me pretty badly. I spent the rest of the evening constantly thinking back to it.

Eventually we've gotten bored and moved onto another movie. there's a lesbian kiss scene. My parents are laughing, my mom playfully smacking my dad on the leg while he grins. Out of nowhere i say, ""is this supposed to be erotic?""

I don;t know why! I just...said it. then my dad turned to me still grinning. 

""maybe when you're older."" 

I'm 18 goddamnit. If this would've been something i could just leave in my past, I wouldn't be depressed for five goddamn years.

I left the room and went upstairs. Turned the shower on and just collapsed to the shower floor. Dry heaving and crying.

Anyway, I sit there, fill out the paper work, I do my best to hide all the information on it because guys decided to come sit right next to me in my bubble despite plenty of room 5 feet away. Plus I'm paranoid as shit going to a DMV so close to where I know my mother is staying but it's the best DMV I know of, it's actually pretty darn quick (like an hour/hour and a half sitting when it's busy but not packed).

She immediately apologizes and tells me how wonderful I look, and just WOW ""I never would have known!"" Yeah, I figured, that's why I had every bit of paperwork I could gather ready for this (doctors note explaining X is in fact ME, Drivers License, debit cards, credit cards, SSC, birth certificate, mail, a signed letter from my boss with his number for confirmation), perhaps going a bit overboard on my prep. 😅

She is instantly my best friend, and starts talking to me with this ""oh girl, I am SO relieved that you understand when bullshit is bullshit"" attitude. It was fantastic! She leans in a little and says ""ok, so before I do this, I need to tell you that I have to call someone above me over here, because the camera might not recognize you, in which case I need to let them know that I'm going to override it. OK?"" Girl, thank you for giving me a heads up, I know you gotta do your job and you want to protect my privacy as much as you can. She flags someone down and tells them very very quietly. I hear snatches of ""now I believe that she is this person here, but the computer might not..."" and ""Yes, without a doubt!"" And lady #2 nods and walks away, looking shocked.

Lady #1 And I chat for another few minutes before getting down to business: checking my eyes and the new photo. Keep in mind, I'm not wearing makeup and I'm intensely uncomfortable without it. She even offered to let me put on the makeup I keep in my purse, despite it not being technically allowed for people with that tiny M on their DL 😒 I think about it, but decline because I know my hands are shaking too badly for me to properly put on eyeliner, but it's the thought that counts.

After my picture (where I'm giving my best lesbian smirk. Hey, she was pretty damn cute!) I noticed that lady #2 is whispering to another person a few cubicles over (did I mention I'm paranoid?)

Her jaw drops and this look of total boob envy is palpable. We chat for a few more minutes before she hands me my new ID paper and I get up to leave.

Now on my way out I can't help but glance back: I have 4 people staring directly at my ass, one of which was Lady #1 who knows she's been caught.

2017-10-15 22:13:47,76m494,4,3,"Hello, I'm going through the motions of figuring out if I am trans. This may more just be a sort of self-therapy and getting stuff out there, but here goes.

So I am a 21 year old person. I was born male. When I was a little kid I liked to dress up in my mums coats and shoes, which she knew about and didn't really make much of. Then when puberty hit I got more interested in wearing my mums bras and knickers, and tights and swimsuits etc. She never once caught me. The arousal was both sexual and ""inside me"" (whatever that meant). I used to wear my mums bras to sleep and be super paranoid she would walk in and see the straps, I once even wore them under my normal clothes but soon took it off. I used to wish so bad that I would wake up and just be a girl- I even used to pray to God (Allah in this case as I was brought up a Muslim).

Throughout secondary school I mainly had guy friend, but I never felt I was one of them if I'm being perfectly honest. I was always interested in what the girls were doing, and was super jealous of the guys that used to hang around them. I was a quite a shy and dorky kid, so I didn't have the guts to go and make friends.

Then I went to a sixth form that was further away from my home and met lots of different people from all over the area. I started becoming friends with more people. I realised I liked being friends with girls as opposed to guys. This may have had something to do with liking a lot of them. Even though I had guy friends, I still was never really close to them. All this while I was jealous of what I see some of the girls wearing, thinking to myself ""That looks so stunning, I wish I had that frame and body and that gender, why couldn't I just be born a girl"". Now my mums not the most religious person, but she's fairly religious and something like this would definitely have been dismissed. Also I didn't want to disappoint her, Im an only child-straight A student. I wanted to make her proud. The cross dressing still happened, but this time I wore a lot of her clothes and tried on her makeup (very badly- might I add). I think I'm such a freak. I have a cross dressing fetish. I am a freak of nature.

Roll around to university and I'm out there on my own independent of my parents. I decide to do a little shopping and buy some Ann Summers lingerie and some other sex toys from love honey etc. Everytime I did this I purged the whole lot, saying I need to be a man and every time I purged I binge bought the whole load of it again. This happened twice in first year of university, three times in second year, twice in third year and its happened twice already in my fourth year. I've obviously spent a lot of money on this. I think I still considered it a fetish. Whilst I was at uni I under dressed in bras and knickers all the time, usually hiding it with loose fitting clothes, and jumpers/ coats.

Now I was diagnosed with depression and bulimia in July 2017. I'm currently on medication for the depression and am getting therapy with both the depression and bulimia. I've not mentioned any of this to my GP/ therapist because I still believed it was a fetish. Before my last purge I went full whack, and bought a wig, nail polish, clothes from online and even went shopping in person to buy women clothes from primark etc. It was then that I discovered when I was wearing the clothes and the wig and the makeup (again applied poorly) I felt happy-happier than I had been for a long time. I was also doing these things and I wasn't getting turned all the time. I just enjoyed the feeling of wearing female clothing.

During this past year as well as the cross dressing I also purchased a breast pump (to try and increase the size of my breasts) and self medication for oestrogen hormones. Used them for a while then binned the whole lot as I didn't want my doctor seeing anything funny from blood tests I was having done linked to the bulimia. I considered before my last purge, maybe i'm transgender. I wasn't sure, I knew I was at least somewhere on the spectrum that was not cis male. I lasted all of 4 weeks before I went ahead and bought some more female clothes, spending a tonne of money on this stuff- again!

I have been seriously considering telling my GP. But I don't know how to/ what will happen. I've imagined coming out to my housemates and mum. But theres so many things my mum does not know about, that I don't want to overwhelm her and I still don't want to disappoint her. Im scared my housemates will reject me and tell me that I'm just a sexual fiend or something. But more and more i'm tucking and wearing knickers and a bra. I bought my first proper pair of female high wasted jeans. I wear on my hips whilst in guy mode but pull them up to my waist when I have a t shirt that will cover up the high waist.
I don't think I've ""let on"" to anyone that Im having gender dysphoria. I just don't know what to do.

Just a few of my peers know, for the most part I've really kept it a secret because I live at the southern tip of the Bible Belt, yay for queer little me. I've hinted and danced around the topic with my mother, but haven't really said anything concrete. To my grandparents I am still their granddaughter and they ignore my lack of cishet-edness as much as they can.

Now, I'm in a very commited long term relationship with a wonderful non-binary person (going to use the feminine pronouns as that is her preference) whom has been patient with my stumblings to self-awareness. She is my rock. She isn't here right now though, she out with her mom. She would be whom I would normally turn to right now.

My grandmother, who is the reason I am a sweet-natured person, whom sends me what money she can to help me out due to life issues, posts [this](https://youtu.be/V46vsKcRw_E) just an hour ago on Facebook. Be warned it could be triggering, trust me.

I'm panicky, I don't know what to do. I want to vomit. My beloved grandma thinks I'm crazy, that I am making this up for attention or what have you.

Sadly at some point my girlfriend left me. She was cheating on me anyway and i was always forgiving her just to keep her. How stupid i am.

There's one good friend left that i talk to around once a week but he knows nothing about my female feelings. He also hates gays and makes fun of ""these shemales"" which makes me very sad. 
Whenever i look into the mirror i see this ugly hairy guy that is getting old by now. I'll be 40 next year :(. 
Because of my gender disphoria i am not confident and masculine in my behavior so girls don't fall in love with me. In the past 10 years there were 2 girls that i could trick into believing i was a guy but after a few weeks they lost interest. My personality just doesn't fit my body. I also have an eating disorder. I was skinny, i was fat. I starve and binge eat. For the past few years i got pretty fat again. I'm just so ugly :(. 
There's no way out of this anymore. 
I am doomed to be alone and recently i have been thinking about why i even still participate in this terrible joke of a life. If i wasn't such a coward i would have killed myself already. Maybe some day i'll be strong enough to end this painful journey.

2017-10-22 15:59:44,7810bp,5,11,"Hey friends, you've got another questioning kid. My gender questioning has taken a hardcore uptick in the last month because I got a binder for myself- after three years of debate with my trans partner- and I put it on and just bawled. I looked in the mirror and for the first time since middle school I didn't hate my body. I thought I would just wear it around the house to see how I felt, but I've been having to remind myself every day that it's unhealthy to wear it more than eight hours and I *have* to take it off now. My friends took me shopping for masc clothing and I was able to shop without a panic attack. In fact, since I've started wearing it my social anxiety has basically dropped to nothing. I can dress for dates with my partner and not cry because nothing I own looks right or good enough, I wear more than sweatpants and baggy shirts, and I even have a better relationship with my jiggly tummy (I realized recently I'd been interpreting my womanly curves and breasts as just extra fat-bags on my chest and I felt horrible with them). 

So my main problem with my internal debate is that I don't know where I draw the line between just being pleased that I can achieve the ""butch aesthetic"" which I've always desired in one way or another, or if I need to do some more searching, and if so, down what avenue. 

(tmi?) I've felt before that I've had a ""lack"" of a penis, mostly when sleeping with women and I'd just make up for it by placing my fingers in front of my pelvis, and until my current relationship I've always been a pure top because it never felt... Right? Having other people touch me like that? But these are all things that could just be like super uuber butch feelings. 

So that's my question to others- I live in a trans house but not with any other lesbian identified AFABs so I'm asking you, dear internet- I'm wondering if anyone who is in that identity/considered it before can chat with me a bit about how you drew the line between them because gender is messy and confusing, and a butch identity allows for so much masculinity!

My gender questioning has taken a hardcore uptick in the last month because I got a binder for myself- after three years of debate with my trans partner- and I put it on and just bawled. I looked in the mirror and for the first time since middle school I didn\'t hate my body. I thought I would just wear it around the house to see how I felt, but I\'ve been having to remind myself every day that it\'s unhealthy to wear it more than eight hours and I *have* to take it off now. My friends took me shopping for masc clothing and I was able to shop without a panic attack. In fact, since I\'ve started wearing it my social anxiety has basically dropped to nothing. I can dress for dates with my partner and not cry because nothing I own looks right or good enough, I wear more than sweatpants and baggy shirts, and I even have a better relationship with my jiggly tummy (I realized recently I\'d been interpreting my womanly curves and breasts as just extra fat-bags on my chest and I felt horrible with them). \n\nSo my main problem with my internal debate is that I don\'t know where I draw the line between just being pleased that I can achieve the ""butch aesthetic"" which I\'ve always desired in one way or another, or if I need to do some more searching, and if so, down what avenue. \n\n(tmi?) I\'ve felt before that I\'ve had a ""lack"" of a penis, mostly when sleeping with women and I\'d just make up for it by placing my fingers in front of my pelvis, and until my current relationship I\'ve always been a pure top because it never felt... Right? Having other people touch me like that? But these are all things that could just be like super uuber butch feelings. \n\nSo that\'s my question to others- I live in a trans house but not with any other lesbian identified AFABs so I\'m asking you, dear internet- I\'m wondering if anyone who is in that identity/considered it before can chat with me a bit about how you drew the line between them because gender is messy and confusing, and a butch identity allows for so much masculinity!\n\nFeel free to dm me &lt;3 \nThanks y\'all', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Where do you draw lines between Butch Woman v.

☆Okay, so this is pretty basic but it's worth a mention. Get yourself a self care pack. You can do this irl, but on your phone too. If you want to do this in real life, then gather stuff that would comfort you, when your gender dysphoria kicks in. For example, write nice messages on pieces of paper, and put them in a jar, or bottle or whatever you feel like. And when you feel bad, just get a random one out, read it, and then put it back, and mix the jar/bottle/whatever up again. Also, having lots of blankets, movies, youtube or netflix nearby is a pretty neat solution too. Now hurrs the kicker. How do you do it on your phone? Well, for example, download cute games, put them into a folder called ""Self care"" or ""You are valid"" or something like that. Also, having a playlist of comforting videos, and songs helps too.

I've been thinking seriously for some time now about what I really am (made another post here few months ago). After thinking about this a lot I've come to the conclusion that, even though I feel like I would like to be a girl, I think that if I actually became one I'm not sure if I'd like it.

It's kinda like a fetish if you want to call it like that. Many people get turned on by things that in reality they wouldn't like if they happened to them. This is similar (I think) to what's happening to me, except that it doesn't happen because I'm horny. I don't know... if I had been born in a girl body I probably would have liked it, but eh, there's no way to be sure now. But if I was to transition now I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like it.

I'm making this post since one or two days ago I was talking about this to a friend, and she said that she kinda felt like that too (but in the opposite way). I didn't know this was possible, does this happen to anyone else?

I've been identifying as agender for a while now, and I think it's what fits me the best. However, knowing that for sure is very hard (how can you know that you *don't have* something?).

2017-10-26 05:24:05,78tiqi,6,9,"As the title says, this is my ""so I think maybe I'm trans"" post (I guess that makes me prospective MtF). Basic story, I graduated college in '16 so I'm 23. 

I've always been teased for being less masculine. I wouldn't say ""effeminate"" is definitely the right word, but loud, boisterous, (I like to think) kind and sensitive. Fashionable (again, I like to think) artistic, not athletic at all, and until a few years ago, pretty overweight.

I thought my body/gender issues were a weight problem and—while that certainly didn't help matters—I've lost a lot of weight over the last 5 years, and have been in pretty good shape for the past 3. The first year of weight loss, I was doing great and was super confident, etc. but after a while it wore off. I've been very depressed the last couple of years, and have had a pretty bleak outlook, but have managed to suppress anything bad, and have just sort of coasted through life, always feeling like something is off.

I thought for the last year or so that perhaps I was gay, and that's been a pretty pressing thought in my mind, but I've never been sure, and It never felt super good to identify that way, and imagining myself in a relationship with a cis-guy didn't really feel super great. I talked to a few friends about this, but haven't really acted on it.

About a week ago, it donned on me that maybe I'm trans, and it really was like the sky opened up and I just sort of had this ""HOLY. SHIT."" Moment. I was shopping online and typed in ""sweatpants"" and was taken to the women's section of the website by chance (or fate maybe, jk don't believe in fate). I was all like ""well there's no real difference in women's sweatpants than men's, and they were cheaper, so I was browsing and I looked at this female supermodel and I just thought ""fuck, I want to be you."" And it was like one of the biggest ""AHA!"" Moments I've had. 

I've been looking into it, and heard about the magic Button test and I feel like I'd do that in a heartbeat, but the magic button doesn't exist.

I've looked through some subreddits and have seen people transitioning and am terrified to think that I would be in a phase where I'm presenting, but not passing at all. I mean NO disrespect when I say that AT ALL, and I realize that's 100% a personal problem. I'm just such a self conscious person, that I feel like I would feel worse about my looks if I were in that stage than I do now.

That being said, I've tried being a little more effeminate in my presentation/mannerism the last week, and I haven't been in such a good mood in years. I've felt very very confident and comfortable, and the idea of one day presenting full female actually sounds really great! 

But so many of my gender issues, I feel, stem from trying to be a guy in a world where a guy has to be ABC, and being criticized for not being that. I'm afraid that transitioning may be even worse for me in that regard.

I'm also afraid of me thinking this is something helpful to do now but then the depression will just come right back and I'll realize that's not the right choice and wasn't the root of it at all. I wish we lived in a world where everyone was free to just slide around the gender scale as they saw fit; to dip their toes in the water, if you will. But we don't and I'm afraid of both trying and not having it help, and also of not trying at all. 

Also very afraid of my parents/family reaction, I think my parents would be cool but maybe not, I have no idea.

Lastly I was looking up gender-based subreddits and saw ""gender critical"" and that scared the shit out of me and made me feel horrible and afraid as well. 

TL;DR: I'm afraid. 

Anyways, and help or advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

At this time in my life my abusive mother (was in foster care, have had three abusive mothers) cut off my hair as a punishment and people started to mistake me for a boy. I was elated. At this point I started having people call me by a more masculine version of my current name. When people pointed out ""but that's a boys name!"" it made happy. 
But I didn't identify as trans or a boy, I just wished I were one and was happy when people mistook me for one.

When I was a little older I said it was so that I could date girls without being judged .


then I was sexually abused for 9 months and I told myself it was because I wanted to be big and strong and able to defend myself. I had an eating disorder, I hated my body, and I kept telling myself that I don't like dressing like a girl because I'm just not comfortable with my body and once the eating disorder was better I'd be more comfortable. The eating disorder got better, I came out as gay, I started dating girls and it just didn't go away.
I was explaining all this to my girlfriend one night, while a bit loopy on sleeping meds, and how if I could just sew up my lady bits I'd be so much happier because I get nothing from them existing, and that I hate having to buy clothes that accommodate my breasts, and I just hate being so short and weak and she said... ""are you maybe trans?"" That was the first time I'd ever considered that it was anything other than a bunch of separate reasons.
From there, I tried dressing ""like a man"" and suddenly I realized that the reason I felt so uncomfortable in dresses and skirts wasn't that I hated my body, it was the clothes I was wearing. what seemed to be depression- wearing sweatpants and tshirts under coats everywhere all the time - went away and suddenly I cared about dressing nicely every day as long as I didn't have to wear feminine clothing. I didn't despise and feel awkward wearing makeup because I was self hating and lazy I just hated make up- and that was ok. I got all my hair cut off, as my mom had done except not a hack job- loved it. I started wearing super tight sports bras and that got rid of a lot of anxiety for me. The other day someone mistook me for a man and called me sir and it made my entire day. All day I was confident. 


NSFW:
and then, there's the sexual aspect. I don't enjoy sex partially from trauma and partially because I hate my body, and don't want anyone interacting with my ""lady bits."" I'll do things to women and enjoy that. I get ""turned on,"" Im not asexual. After doing something for someone else, I would jill off imagining I was a dude in the scenario and get off that way.

Taylor started working at my work a few months ago. I was unsure if they were male or female (very androgynous look and voice leaning feminine but some masculine things as well) and as I wasn't close with them, I didn't want to just come out and ask.

M: You just said her. And I've heard others so I was getting confused and I just don't want to refer to him the wrong way especially in front of him.

S: Oh, I meant to say him. I must have done it without thinking because he used to be a girl.

I realized that I enjoyed cross dressing in a non-sexual way and thought of myself as a cross dresser for a while. Now I'm dressing up more and more and not in just sexual contexts which leads me to think I'm gender fluid. I haven't come out to anyone but my girlfriend so I don't know what it's like to be a woman in public yet. I'll admit, I'm terrified of being trans. I'm trying to separate myself from my fears right now and really examine how I feel about my gender. So far I've realized that I like dressing up in certain contexts. When I'm lounging at home, playing video games, doing chores, or cooking I like dressing up and getting pretty. When I'm in meetings, running, hiking, paint balling, and doing outdoorsy stuff I like being a macho outdoorsman. Does anyone else feel this way? Are there any common signs of trans denial I could look for? Am I alone in feeling my gender is situational?

 

PS this is my porn alt so be careful with my post history :P
