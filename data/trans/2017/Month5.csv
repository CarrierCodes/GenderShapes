2017-05-06 06:19:39,69jtak,6,16,"I guess this is just a random dump of my recent experiences. Just for some background, I was cross dressing for all the events described in this post. Pretty much cross dressing every day at this point.

I went to a concert on Sunday night on a whim. I felt super uncomfortable when I was being patted down. I was afraid the guy was going to touch me somewhere inappropriate. He didn't, but I just realized I've never felt that way about my body before. I'm usually just annoyed that I'm being patted down.

There was a dude in line for the concert who had apparently drank too much too fast. He was pretty out of it. I offered to his girlfriend to get him some water, and she immediately hugged me. That felt good. :) I bought ginger ale instead (because I thought it would help settle his stomach) from a shop across the street and brought it back to him. She thanked me and asked me for my name. I gave it to her (it's an androgynous name), and it seemed like she referred to me as a ""person"" to her boyfriend because she wasn't sure how I identified, which is fine with me. I intentionally picked an androgynous nickname a few months ago to gauge whether I pass or not. I may change it later, but right now I don't currently identify as female, just non-conforming male.

The bathroom situation is getting really uncomfortable. I'm still using the men's restroom, but one time I was throwing out my paper towel when some guy came in and looked noticably traumatized. I asked him if he was okay and he just gave me a weird face. I think I passed for a split second which is why he freaked out. Then I talked to him and threw a wrench into it with my voice. :|

I don't really feel comfortable using the urinals anymore, because I need to resituate everything every time I go and it's easier to do in the stall. Also I've just started wearing wired so I'm constantly having to fuss with my straps and positioning. I'm learning that if the wire comes up too high in the middle that it digs into my chest... Ouch. I've been nervous ever since the freak out guy that someone who is not from my company (it's a rental complex that my company owns 1 3/4 floors. My floor is the 3/4 one) would come into the bathroom right as I was coming out of the stall and I would surprise them.

My sister's graduation is coming up. I try to avoid cross dressing *too much* whenever family is around, which usually equates to wearing a less obvious bralette and a neutral top, but still wearing makeup and nail polish, women's pants, etc. I would really rather not have to jump through those hoops at all, because I feel like of all people I should feel comfortable around my family, but I actually feel more comfortable at work. I just don't want to upset them too much. Recently this has equated to not visiting family as much anymore.

Work has been... Interesting. I know one other Christian who is in support of me there. He's been really interested in getting my perspective on it, and has asked me really specific questions about whether I'm going to get surgery or not. He's been very clear that if I need any help that I can turn to him.

The really difficult thing is that there's a person I like at work, but I get the sense that because of what I'm doing to my identity, that makes me a turn off for them. We're very good friends though, and I've started to open up to her about everything, and she's been giving me advice here and there. She's not uncomfortable with me at all, which I really appreciate.

I have crushes on a few guys at work, but I don't feel driven to pursue them, because I personally feel that's wrong, and as I said to my counselor, ""I can appreciate a good looking guy but that doesn't mean I want to be in a relationship with one.""

Just recently, my boyfriend has come out as transgender. The last year has been a mess.. He was constantly angry with me and had mood flashs all the time with no proper explanation. He wasn't treating me nicely and I was always kind with him and did everything for him. I thought, that I was constantly annoying him and doing everything wrong. I spent hours crying and eating, not showing him my true emotions. This may sound naive, but I always subconsciously knew, that there was something else bugging him. Hence, I accepted his behavior.

I am very much in love with him and one day I would like to have a family with him. The first words I told him were: I am proud of you. I truly was! There was so much pressure off me. From this day on, there were no more fights and we were talking endlessly and there was a much closer bound between the two of us. It also turned out as something exciting and beautiful for me to discover his female side together with him. Today, I organised his first consultation meeting with a doctor for him, because he was afraid about the phone call. The only thing that is taking over me is: FEAR. I have no problem with him transitioning to a woman, (it may sounds stupid but I listened to my heart) but i have concerns:

How did you guys tell everyone about your transition? Is it true, that you can lose your sex drive? I am very concerned about this :( It makes a lot of sense to me, since the testosteron is diminishing. What about becoming parents one day? Is it true, that after a while you will be infertile? What about testicular atrophy? To which extent will his penis shrink? Artificial insemination seems so unnatural to me. I have always dreamed about being a mom, conceiving naturally. However, what in life really does occur in the way you imagined it?

I would appreciate your stories that would show me, that there is no need to be afraid. I never cared what people thought about me, as long as I was happy. Being in a relationship with a woman is something that I can imagine, since I am sexually attracted to them, but never had a relationship with one.

So dearest reddit community, please help me. I really appreciate it!

2017-05-14 05:55:03,6b2h77,7,3,"So, as I've posted before, I'm cross dressing pretty much every day. Not doing dresses or any outer clothing types that are traditionally female only, just jeans, dress pants, sweaters, T-shirts, etc. I don't really pass yet (and maybe I never will), but I'm confident enough that I don't care as much anymore. I don't mind the double takes and up-down looks I get from some people (I actually enjoy them), but sometimes I'll get a *really* nasty look from some people, and that causes me to get anxious. I still don't identify as female, and I'm still not sure about that. I've had another Redditor try to tell me that I'm a trans woman in denial. I wonder if it's that or if I'm a queer who's taking things farther than they really want to go.

I'm concerned that I've kind of forced myself to head down this path without seriously considering what I want, and whether I want to lose my existing friends over it. Some people have called me miss and ma'am recently, and I just have kind of let it happen. It did get me a little excited though. I was in Goodwill the other day shopping for more women's clothes and I forgot to use the restroom before I left work. I rushed into the women's without even thinking about it. It was a standalone, so it didn't really matter that much anyway...

I originally started cross dressing because a friend had helpfully pointed out, ""how do people expect to improve if they can't make mistakes?"" I started then and haven't really stopped. I felt really uncomfortable at first, but it's getting better, and I do like the way I look. The only circumstances I don't dress up as much are when I'm with family, because I don't want to upset them. Also I try to avoid meeting them in casual settings anymore, and since I don't have any dresses that means I'm wearing a suit, which I hate.

I'm actually pretty excited that I can fit some bras semi properly now, but now every time I sneeze I can feel it in my nips. 😯 I guess that's normal? It's a nice sensation but really distracting. I dislike that my leg hair is taking so long to go away. I've tried waxing before, and got a pretty good result in my lower arms, but it's starting to come back now. I think my spiro is too low. Hopefully it can be increased after my next blood test.

My family knows the name I've picked for myself (at least for now. It's not terribly feminine so I might change it sometime soon) and has implicitly rejected it, even though it's androgynous, and even though I explained to them that I had picked it because my birth name is really common at my workplace and in the world, which isn't a lie, but also not the whole truth. I haven't really pressed the issue, but I've changed it on Facebook, so they're aware of it.

I went to my old church today for a get together, to catch up with some friends there and play volleyball. The church isn't trans friendly at all, which was part of the reason I left, since the pastor seemed to be railing on the issue every few weeks. (I wasn't out at the time, but was taking hormones.) Mostly everyone treated me nice, but I kind of felt like they were taking pity on me. That could just be my warped perspective though. I was never good at reading people, and I was kind of depressed, so maybe they were just noticing that. Or maybe I was just projecting how I thought they would feel onto them.

2017-05-15 05:58:46,6b8oyu,4,15,"Tl,dr; so far, so good

Hi everyone,

I'm right at the beginning of this whole thing, and while I've always felt like I wasn't normal, not really relating to men, feeling more comfortable with women, not having a real sense of gender identity, for the last few months I've been feeling really dysphoric, and really euphoric when thinking of myself as my preferred gender. 

I'm married, and receiving treatment for depression anyways, so brought up how I'm feeling with my doctor who doesn't know anything about dysphoria but seems really supportive. I've had a bunch of fights with my wife, but I think we're going to go through this together - fingers crossed. I decided to tell my parents about how I'm feeling, as a kind of heads-up about what I'm going through - my mom was unconditionally supportive, and even tried to stop using gendered words on the phone, which was really sweet :) it just came to a head and I needed to get it out. She told my dad, who I've not spoken to yet, and I'm a little scared of that conversation but I think there are going to be a lot of scary comversations going forward. I'm not convinced I am trans, yet, because apparently it could be a side effect of my medication, maybe? Or something? In any case, I don't know what's going on yet and I'm going to get hold of someone locally I can talk to to help sort through all of this stuff.

Quick story short, I'm 26, born male. Since I was 8, for various reasons, I kept on thinking and **feeling** that I was actually a girl inside a boy's body. But I had no dysphoria whatsoever. To this day, I still have no dysphoria. I just felt like I was a girl who, born in the wrong body, just managed to accept it and lived meeting societal expectations of my biological sex.


With the help of my awesome girlfriend, after many years, I managed to understand that I'm not a girl, nor a boy, but something of a mix of the two. What I could gater about androgyny really clicked with me and makes me feel at peace. Sadly, my native language(spanish) has no gender neutral words or pronouns, and is heavily gendered. So, just my girlfriend and a bunch of my closest friends know what I am, as I keep on presenting as male. It's just less of a hassle, and after all, I'm at least *part* male anyway.


I come to you asking for advice. In spanish, words end up either in O for male and A for female. I thought the @ symbol would fit perfectly (as it kind of looks like an A inside an O, which would represent me perfectly), but I'm too anxious to just start using it, even in chat with the ones that know that I'm androgynous and support me...


Also, I'd like to know what I can do about my appearance to look more femenine and/or more blurry between male or female.

I would consider doing it for free, but it may be a lot of time and planning so of course compensation for my time would be nice. I'll take any suggestions/tips for that, as well.

1. How would I find local trans people looking for help?

2. How do I create a super trans-friendly space? (I mean aside from pronoun use, saying anything stupid, etc. One example, how do I help someone feel comfortable going into a makeup store?)

I can already hear your response in my head-- your skepticism, your arguments.

You asked me why and I, red-faced, could only stammer that I didn't know. This was no lie, I truly did not know, it was simply a compulsion. I saw these 'feminine' objects and was inexplicably drawn to them.

I've contemplated and struggled with this more actively for about ten years now. Along with many other people like me, it became more apparent and inescapable around puberty. Since the time I started to develop an attraction to girls, my fantasies have almost invariably involved imagining myself as a girl, and when I saw someone I found attractive, my feelings were not simply a matter of attraction but also of jealousy. I have always been overly fixated on their clothing, their makeup, their femininity, because I wanted that for myself. Movies or TV shows where a male and female character switch bodies have always particularly fascinated me, and now I know why. I would often dream of some magical being from one of my video games casting a spell and transforming me into a beautiful girl. I don't want to go into more sordid details, but suffice it to say that these feelings continued into and throughout high school.

I have always been insecure about my masculinity, as you well know. My height, my size, my facial hair and other features, my stoicism-- there was not a single day as far back as I can remember where I didn't have these things on my mind, gnawing at me. Even as many of these characteristics improved, my insecurity surrounding them only grew. How could I ever be secure in something which doesn't suit me, some Platonic masculine ideal I could never and would never achieve. I wanted these things because I had learned that these are the traits which make a man, but it was merely an illusion. I have been hiding behind a facade of masculinity for so long that it will take a long time to become acquainted with an identity I never allowed to properly develop. I'm sure living with someone as hyper-masculine and closed minded as dad didn't help. In the past few weeks even as I was terribly anxious over exams and horribly conflicted about this issue, something changed abruptly. These insecurities disappeared almost like flipping a switch and for the first time in over a decade, I have developed some semblance of peace in this respect. I'm obviously still dissatisfied with my body, no surprise given my situation, but the insecurities of masculinity which have dominated my consciousness in public and private for so long have finally eased.

The past few months have truly been a special kind of hell. As studying proceeded on schedule and my anxiety improved with medication but still lingered, there was nothing left to hide behind anymore. I was finally forced to confront this spectre of distress and discomfort which accompanies me everywhere, and has for so long. I had considered this explanation before, but I always figured these feelings were just some odd sexual desire and the sense of shame which might accompany it. The reality though is that people who aren't trans don't constantly imagine themselves as women regardless of their sexual interests. I'm also not ashamed about how I feel, I'm not ashamed of any of these things. I am who I am and there is no point in fighting it. What I really feared was the disapproval of others-- not of society at large, but of the people whom I care about. You wonder why I avoided talking to you about my anxieties, why I lied and told you I was fine when I wasn't. How could I explain something like this? I didn't even understand or accept it myself until recently. 

The timing with my exams was certainly unfortunate, but life seems to have a way of throwing things at you when it's most inconvenient. Imagine how hard it has been to focus on my final preparations and indeed on the exams themselves with all this on my mind, along with legitimately being mentally exhausted from the endless cycle of stress, revision, and exams. So after tons of reading (as you know I always do), after speaking to others like me, and after much agonizing contemplation, this was the inescapable conclusion. Hopefully you can come to accept this, even if it takes some time. I can only imagine that it's hard to lose a son, or at least your perception of the person you think you've come to know, but it's still me-- the parts of me that matter anyway. You've sometimes wished you had a daughter, right? Well now you can. That feels so weird to say, and I think it probably will for quite a while, but it's the truth.

This also provides some context for my depression and anxiety issues. I'm sure I'm predisposed anyway, but their persistence is telling. Even at my best points while being treated, even during times when I've truly had nothing on my mind, a relentless nagging discomfort has been present. It has pervaded my every waking moment for so long that I don't know what it feels like to simply be content and happy. Things which bring me joy are always accompanied by a voice in the back of my mind that makes it feel wrong... I've become so accustomed to stress and fear that I feel bad even about feeling good. Well I deserve to be happy. I deserve to find peace. If I don't embrace this, I don't know that I ever will.

Oh and one last thing, please don't worry about what my friends might think. I have always surrounded myself with tolerant and open-minded people because I find the ones who think like dad to be repulsive. All the ones who matter to me know at this point, and none have been anything less than fully supportive and accepting.
