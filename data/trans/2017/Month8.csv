I am a queer female doctoral student in clinical psychology and conducting a research study on stress, resilience, and sex among trans women. Much of my research and clinical training thus far has focused on mental health outcomes and HIV risk within trans populations. Right now, I'm looking for trans women to complete a 10-minute, anonymous, online survey. By participating, you can help the mental health field develop better, trans-specific interventions and ultimately provide more effective mental health and medical care to trans women.

Please consider participating if you 1. identify as a transgender female, trans woman, or trans girl, 2. are 18 years or older, and 3. live in the United States.

Completion of the survey will only take 10 minutes and is entirely online! You will be asked to answer a brief demographic questionnaire, a survey of psychosocial adjustment, and an inventory of sex behaviors; your completed responses will be anonymous. Upon completion, you will be eligible to win one of five $50 Visa gift cards. If you meet the criteria above and would like to participate, click the link below!

Anyway, just wanted to ask about the rationale behind it? Is it a purely physical thing? Eg. If men want to become women, is it just so that they get the breasts/cooch? And if so, why do some trans folk not want to pursue a sex change (aside from the money issue)?

I mean, aside from the physical, what really separates gender? I don't really care for stereotypes and gender norms, and it is my assumption that as trans people, you all probably don't really care what society thinks as a whole in relation to it either. So if it isn't the acting/filling a predefined role (cause mate it's 2017, nobody really cares are this point), I've come to the conclusion that it must be looks/physical. 

I hear stories of people saying that they've felt like the opposite gender since they were a kid cause they wanted to do 'boy stuff' or wear dresses... but again, I see this as a societal thing, so if we erase that.... how does the whole trans thing fit in?

2017-08-12 02:29:13,6t5yao,5,13,"Hello Reddit,

I am turning to this community because I don't have any trans friends, and feel so low tonight that I am willing to set aside my hesitations to seek help. I apologize in advance for making this long and expositionary, but right now the internet might be my only hope for relief.

I came out to myself as ftm in January of this year. Reddit helped me a lot in terms of information and accepting myself, and the community over at /r/transforthememories encouraged me to examine my own past and accept just how many flags I had overlooked. My family isn't supportive, and many of my friends have been slow to start using he pronouns, using my ""new"" name, etc. I almost made a Facebook post about it today, but it feels kind of silly to make a fuss about something as personal as identity. It didnt seem like the right platform.

In March, I began to experience delusional thinking and paranoia. I was hospitalized twice, broke off my engagement, moved back in with my parents, and generally self isolated. I fell into deeper depression, turned to alcohol, dated my best friend because he was the only person I considered ""safe"", and would drive around for hours in a manic state looking for answers to questions I wasn't sure of. I am currently on Zyprexa and seeing a therapist.

This year has been a huge step forward for my identity, but shit in every other department. My delusions are less frequent now, but to some degree I believe they began as a result of the Trump presidency. I felt targetted. I didn't feel safe anywhere. And I certainly don't have an excess of people who understood where I was coming from as a transgender individual, even from psychological professionals.

So here I am, Reddit. I don't know where my body dysphoria and transness begins and the schizophrenia ends.. or vice versa. Does anyone have any information regarding a correlation between the two?  I am lost. Some times its hard to feel like suicide is not an eventuality. I don't know if I know how to become the person I was born to be.

Any advice or resources you can provide would be stellar.

Sure I have male friends, but those are day-to-day friends, while the people I feel the most confortable with talking about these subjects are all girls (actually I had a pretty long conversation about this with a girl which lead me to finally make this post). 

I don't really like my body (though I don't consider myself ugly), but I don't consider going HRT since I'm 6'9 and yeah being a girl that tall would be awkward (also going through the process would be quite shitty). I think it's more like, I'd have liked to be born as a girl. I don't know, I'm really confused about this and have no idea what to think. Maybe I really I'm trans, maybe it's just a fetish.

If I was a bit more hopeful maybe I'd educate him. Should I do that? I know when I first came out to him three years ago his reaction was negative, but first he also needed to look up what the Catholic stances on it were... as he's Catholic and I know how he is I don't have much faith in it...

The weirdest part of all is that only now I realise the truth behind being born with the wrong body.

I've never been interested in men, always known I was attracted to women. But always struggled in my relationships with women. (I always felt used. Like a sex toy).

I've always been a bit different, and in the last decade I've realized that I dont feel comfortable identifying as either straight, nor male. (Eventhough I like being a man physically, and know that I'm sexually attracted to women. Without telling anyone, I started identifying as a woman who likes women, born in a mans body but really perfectly fine with it...happy even).

Life has always felt too unnecessarily complex, on so many levels, but I'm 35 and for the first time ever I actually feel love (Its quite good). And  for the first time ever I feel human.

It's a relief to me that I found a home so to speak. That I don't have to worry about attempting the classical straight relationships anymore.

 I find that straight people are so overly complicated. Both cis men and cis women. And it's a relief to just be able to accept that that's how I feel. (And I don't have to be afraid of saying or thinking that anymore).

So many are complaining about frustrations, and pointing fingers, while other people are pretty much lost in life. But still try to see good in everyone, and still trying to ad something of value to society, eventhough we so often get told to fuck off one way or another.

You probably know who I am, we hung out with some friends on Halloween a few years ago. I was the medic, you were a homestuck character.

You were one of my only friends at that school. You really made a tough time in my life easier for me, and I took that for granted. I outwardly and flagrantly supported Trump on my Facebook and tried to push it on you, and I don't know if that was what made you delete your profile and unfriend me, but if it was, I'm sorry.

The truth is that I wasn't sure of my own identity and I'm still not. I was projecting and trying to make myself seem tougher to my hyper conservative parents and a friend that I had, and I don't believe *anything* that I said to you or on Facebook anymore. I don't think I did when I posted them either.

I'm not trying to get you to be friends with me again, I understand if you're angry at me, but I want to say that I'm very sorry.

I don't know if I hurt you and I hope that I didn't. But I feel so awful and guilty for it that I just had to get this off my chest. 

Just for identification so that you know it's you I'm posting about, if you're unsure and reading this, but you really liked Homestuck, you went as a character for Halloween, and your birthname was Brielle and I couldn't spell your last name (Sorry about that too, lol).

I came out to her sooner than I wanted to because she caught me with things in my room and knew what it is for. So she kind of force me to tell her if I am ""lesbian or trans"" and I told her I was a trans.

She tells me to give her time to adjust to things but I know she is just saying it until I am 18 years old and can legally kick me out of her house.

My relationship with my mom have never been good and part of it is because of me cause I steal things at a younger age of 9/10 so I can be more of Boy an lie because I'm scare of telling the truth at that time.

My mom always believes in telling the truth but for the pass year of me telling her I am a trans. She still kind of ingnore it to a point. 
She did allow me to cut my hair short and wear ""boy"" clothing but she try to not knowledge that this is who I am. 
Not a daughter but a son.

She asked me to give her sometime to get use to the idea but I don't think she will ever get use to the idea. I bought up changing my name once and it didn't go well.

She says until you're 18 years old, out of my house and get it legally change. I will still call you by the given name. 

She even told my doctors the same things. They can call me whatever I want but infront of her she still want me to be call by my given name. 

She says she having a hard time and she needs time and she don't want to be push into the whole idea of it. 

But for me, it's just her way of saying I am rejecting you.

In 2015, I set up a space for LGBT+ people online who don't have the friends, support circles or information in real life, and therefore have to find that online.

Here's what we believe in:

* Creating a friendly, positive, and safe community for LGBTQIA+ people who may not have access to like-minded people or support in real life. 

* Campaigning for LGBTQIA+ equality online, as well as pushing for the awareness and visibility of other human rights issues.

* Creating an incredibly LGBTQIA+ inclusive space. All too often transgender, intersex, asexual, and other variants of sexuality, gender, or romantic interest are left out. We do not want this to be the case in our community; we are an LGBT+ community.

* Creating a platform for LGBTQIA+ people to showcase their talents, designs, and creations. We really want you to grow in our community, feel free to show off your creativity.


I thought this would be a good way to reach out to people, and let the relevant know that if any of those points do relate to yourself then *there is a place for you*.

If you are interested, feel free to join here!

As well as this we also have ethical and philosophical debates each day, gaming events, a question of the day, etc. :)

I was walking with a girl in town today, me and the girl are dating, I meet a guy from back in high school. We start talking and then he starts flirting. Asks me to come to his place sometime. I tell him that the girl is my date. He tells me : "" Why would you transition if not to date guys? "" 

So I stay calm and tell him that trans women have a sexual orientation like everyone else and that we can date who we are attracted to.
