2017-07-05 13:19:05,6ldyh5,4,31,"It was on a late summer day of August 2012 when it happened. I had been pulled in for a visit to a step-relative at the flip side of my country together with my mother and sister, a visit I really did not want to do, but was coaxed in to doing it anyways. Oh well, I thought, it'll only be the weekend. And besides, I would be bringing my laptop with me that would serve as my distraction. Off I went.

At the time I was a lost, lost person. The little I knew about myself was hampered by a life-long struggle against insecurity and anxiety. Oh, the anxiety was a mess. I never got any proper, ""official"" help for it (which consequently built up as anger inside me). High school was about to end, too, and the pressure to figure your life out, so quickly, was overwhelming. I dealt with this by being my true self, online. It included pretending to be a woman a few times. Unbeknownst to me, it was the perfect set-up for a meltdown.

It happened during the visit. One of the top posts of /r/lgbt of that day appeared on my front page. It was a drawing of various gendered people promoting love and kindness. It led me to /r/asktransgender. I'm sure, if brains could make noises, it would do a loud click with gears rotating shortly after. My first reaction then was, ""Wait, you are allowed to do this?!"" - turns out, yeah, you are.

It shattered a lot of my self-imposed limits. It wasn't even just about the gender, but the concept of taking control of your own life. To experiment and try things out. To make your own choices. It just happened to be about gender this time. It felt like the only open road I could go on to explore myself. So, I did.

It inevitably messed my life up in bad and good ways. My high school was delayed a year. My mental state did a complete meltdown. I changed identity and dropped everyone I knew. But, on the flip side: I became myself, if only with tiny steps. From hormones and from experience. The initial turbulent years could've gone so much more smoother, but it gave me a solid base that I can't set a price tag on.

My parents initially denied my ""phase"". The gender diagnosis didn't arrive until *three* years later after I had applied for help. And it was only then when they suspected I had a problem other than with gender identity. Last year I got a diagnosis in the autistic spectrum and had legal rights to get help for it. I also got an official prescription for hormones. So there's that.

I also kept doubting whether if I was ""trans enough"", seeing as I never felt an overwhelming feeling of being a woman. I never had the typical history of a transgender person, and I never thought about going further than hormones. This led me to try, over and over, to be more female than I actually felt.

I just waited, waited, and waited for the turbulent years to be over. And eventually, it did. I no longer feel obligated to pick either female, or male. I feel comfortable going with just hormones, with an androgynous voice, and with a feminine appearance. I feel secure in myself, not just my gender but with everything, and that really is a wonderful feeling.

I guess I'm writing all of this as a reflective piece for myself, and for all of you. One day, five years ago, I also worried whether I would pass or not. I also worried about hormones, about surgery, and about feeling safe and secure in yourself. And I'd like to say that it is possible to someday feel happy with yourself, even for you. You can someday feel hopeful for the future. You can someday feel happy that you get to experience this life.

Just find people who loves and supports you regardless of your choices.

2017-07-06 13:36:32,6lls03,6,14,"I live in the Houston area, and up until now I've seen David Klarberg at Legacy hospital in Montrose. He's a Nurse Practioner. Normally, I don't get along with NP's. Or male Providers. But my initial visits with Klarberg were great. I felt like he listened to me and didn't judge me, as I was nervous and scared about coming out, and I was dealing with the end of a relationship that had lasted a year. I was actually able to start hormones fairly quickly. 

But after being bumped up from 2mg of estradiol to 4mg per day, things changed. When he bumped me up to 6mg he seemed hesitant. I told him that I had been experiencing cramps and the full range of Period Symptomes (bloating, swollen breasts, intestinal distress, period shits, moodiness, some body aches... the standard for a period, although no bleeding obviously.) Instead of listening to me, he dismissed what I was saying as ""impossible"", yet a good portion of Trans women do experience some of these symptoms every month at a pretty regular time. (Information that I only learned AFTER I started dealing with it and my friend pointed out that my complaints sounded exactly like her period. )

My questions of ""Ok, if it's not that, then what is it?"" Went in one ear and out the other. He refused to even explore the possibility that there might be other causes for these symptoms, instead labeling it as ""a placebo effect"". Dude, up until I had these symptoms, I didn't even know that this could happen. As it stands, I've had period symptoms regularly. Every 4 weeks, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 days. 

Then yesterday, he constantly seemed to be wanting to get out of the room. I felt like I was being judged by him, I felt like he wasn't listening to me at all. He started talking about ""Now that your breasts have come in some, I think we should lower your estrogen some. Back down to the 4mg per day."" Ummm... excuse Me?! I was hoping I could get bumped up again. ""Why? What are you hoping that will accomplish?"" I'm not kidding. That is a direct quote. 

Me: ""umm... a more feminine body? Look, I've gotten some ass, and some hips, and some breasts. Yay. But lowering my estrogen at this point will reduce the fat distribution in my ass and legs, which is a huge point of dysphoria for me. It's also going to pretty much halt the breast growth I've had up until now. I have a pretty solid understanding of how this works. Obviously I'm not stupid, I can read my medical charts without a problem. I do not need or want any medical terminology to be dumbed down to layman's terms.""

Klarberg: ""well, I don't see a reason to bump you up, but I'll leave you at your 6mg per day for now."" He quickly left after that.

Since then, I've made sure that I'm being switched to a different provider within the clinic, one that I've heard only wonderful things about from the trans community. Turns out, Klarberg is like this a lot. It seems to be something that is brought up about him every time his name comes up in the trans community in Houston. 

I'm just SO ticked off. When I called to schedule with a different provider they tried to railroad me in with Klarberg again. I may have been a bit of a bitch about it and told them there was no way in hell that I was going to deal with Klarberg again, that I needed a provider who actually listens to their patients instead of being dismissive.

Does anyone else have to justify their reason for wanting to be bumped up to the next stage of hormones? Also, Klarberg was refusing to give me Progesterone.

Context: My dad is generally republican/conservative and has a history of bigoted views. Lately, that's been improving, especially after I've come out to my family as a gay transman, but he still has difficulty completely accepting gay male intimacy/sex, and other things that are not conventional views of masculinity. Him, my mom and my sister are all supportive, but I can't help but feel extremely frustrated and even angry when things like this come up.

He mentioned something about ""trans men"" ""trying too hard"", and I asked ""trans men or trans *women*?""
He was of course talking about trans women. I explained that MTFs are trans *women*, and I am a trans *man*.
He said it's ""confusing"", to which I responded: ""it's only confusing because you don't see them as real women or men.""
Then he began to say ""well you're a woman-""
I'M NOT A WOMAN. We've been over this. They've known for well over a year. Holy shit, I don't understand why this concept is so difficult to grasp. Trans women are real women. Trans men are real men. Why the hell would they be referred to as trans ""men"" if they are trying so hard to escape being seen as male, and vice versa?

I am male.
I am your son.
I am your brother.
I am your nephew.
I am your friend.
I am Transgender.


I was born Thursday, April 16, 198_. A happy, healthy baby with a head full of black hair. 
The doctor handed me to my mother and said “It's a Girl.” But he was wrong.
I grew up being told “You are a girl.” But they were wrong.
I grew up trying to fit into the box I was told I belonged in. I new something was wrong. I didn't feel right doing “girl” things, wearing “girl” cloths.
I conformed to what was wanted of me, what was expected of me.
I did my school work, made friends, lived my life... all a lie.
Years later I finally “woke” up! I knew what was “wrong”. I am a boy! Everything felt “right”. I started going by male pronouns and wearing what I had always liked wearing but was told it wasn't “lady like” and now I could wear because I was a boy. I changed my name... a few times, till I found the one that was right. I felt happier than I ever had. 
I talked to Dr.s and told them what I felt, I went and talked to them for years. Finally I was able to start hormones to change my body to the appearance I felt inside. I started growing body hair and my voice started to deepen. I started passing as male without a second look. The moment you walk up to a stranger at a fast food place and they say “How may I help you, Sir?” Sir! It felt amazing being seen for who I am.
It's not been easy at all. Life is a struggle every day being who I am. But I wouldn't change a thing! Being miss gendered at birth made me the strong man I am today. My parents raised me the way they felt that they should and I love them for that. I do not hate my parents for calling me their “Daughter”. I was their daughter but now I am their Son. It's a hard change for them to make. 
My parents taught me to respect others. I have a great respect for woman and men. We all have struggles, everyone is different and unique! We are all human! We all love and hate.

I was born and raised in a small Idaho town. Its a lot of things, the college makes it a bit of a liberal oasis, the Idaho gives it a worrying background noise of repressed conservatism, the meth keeps things interesting. I hope to leave soon. I love it here but I know to much about it. Its hard to separate what parts I love and hate because they all blur together under the fog of familiarity. I hope to move to Oregon soon. I love it there and it seems safer. I've known I felt like a girl since I was very small. I've known what being transgender meant since i was about the same age. I loved feeling like a girl but I hated feeling trans. Being a girl felt comfortable, being trans felt like I was signing a contract to be hated. I hate being hated. So I decided to live in my own head and call it good. It worked. lying to the world was easier than lying to myself. I honestly just kept putting it off. Then all of a sudden I was 19, hated myself, and couldn't think of anything that would make me feel better. So I came out as trans to my parents and then hated myself more. I don't want to be trans. Still don't. It would be so convenient to be a white dude. I got good at lying to people. I'm really good at it. People tell me I'm a bad liar. I agree with them. I cant remember how I felt about being a liar or being trans. I think I wished I didn't feel anything. Not feeling anything would be so convenient. I have a hard time talking about myself. What I want, what I think about things. I try to give non answers. It felt more honest because I thought that no one would understand what I wanted, so I had to try to get at what I was saying without actually saying it. Now the non answers just happen and I cant seem to find how I feel about things sometimes. A lot of the time. Maybe not that often. It feels like I write so much differently than I talk because I write in my head. I didn't speak in my head. I lived in my head and my voice was to lie and protect myself. Now when I talk I don't hear myself. I just hear a tool that I used for lies. And when I try to say how I feel it still feels like a lie because the voice in my head isn't speaking. I loved acting. It felt so real, I was doing the same things I would be doing anyway, putting on faces, making the emotions real because they have to be real to make the lie work. But it was real because the lies moved into the background, into the setting, into the play. Being on stage was beautiful because it was all lies. And I already knew how to tell beautiful lies. I'm scared of lying to myself. I'm not really scared of anything else. What else is there to fear? even the fear of being wrong about my transition is smaller than that. Just a small feature on a larger landscape of terror. But when I tell myself that i feel like a girl, that convenience doesn't mean happiness, and that the only thing required to be honest is to try, I don't feel afraid. And although calling myself a boy everyday for the purposes of convenience comes easily. Saying I'm a boy is as easy a screaming. I can never complete the thought. And when I try to I get so... well i think i'm afraid. And its the thought that counts right? I just wish i could think out loud. When I was in 6th grade I was on a field trip, they called me a girl. And I asked them to stop. And it hurt so much. And then they kept calling me a girl, and I cant remember how I felt about it, but trying to feel bad about it felt so... inconvenient. And I remember wanting to tell them that it was fine they could keep doing it. But I just couldn't find the voice.

I was a bit awkward and didn't really have many friends to sit with, so when I would occasionally run into people that were freshmen with me in the School of Drama, I would ask if I could sit with them.

I'm not good enough that anyone would ever accept me as a girl nor if I never came out. 

I'm not going to be able to go on. I can't keep sleeping on the floor renting out a stranger's basement hoping I can save money to fix my life. I am going to lose my most reliable job soon because I'm losing focus and getting sluggish because I can't stop hating myself and what's happening to me.

My ex and former best friend either doesn't accept that I'm trans or she doesn't care. I'm not good enough for her to see me as one of her trans friends. I can't even use facebook with my preferred name because every time I try to make an account to talk to trans groups I keep getting taken down because it knows I'm the same person who already made an account on my deadname years ago.

I'm never going to be able to afford treatment, surgery, cosmetics, or even cute clothes or make up. I'm so ashamed to ever show myself in public and I'm scared to talk to anyone who was my friend. 

I hate that my adopted parents would charge me a thousand dollars a month to sleep in a storage closet because they can't stand me even though they'll go out of their way to leer at me and touch me and watch me wherever I go. I hate that I have dissociative identity and one of my personalities keeps thinking I should try to be a man. I hate having intrusive compulsive thoughts that make me not able to stop thinking about how ugly and unacceptable i am to my former best friend.

I hate that I never told her that I wanted to be a woman for her all those years ago while I was still in school. I hate that I can't afford any mental help anymore, I wish I was at least still on risperdol even though it wasn't working so maybe I could develop breast tissue for a side effect.

I hate everyone thinking that I am trying to be a man and using anything girly about me as an insult. I hate being told I would look handsome with short hair. I hate that my roommates I'm trying to make peace with don't want me shaving my body hair and think that if we're going to help each other with the shit situation we're all in they should view me as their son. I hate my voice and I hate that no one ever will want me to sing or read to them. 

I can't stand feeling unsafe and unacceptable more from transwomen than even people like my relatives who just hate me blindly. I hate that I'll never bee good enough, that I'll never beautiful, and I could never have a child. I hate that my best friend is just giving away anything that was ever special to me because she's in love with other girls and can't see me as one. I hate that even if she would look at me again she'd see me as a boy being weak and slutty trying to look like a girl. I hate that there's nowhere I can be at peace anymore and no one I can trust. I hate that even if I was pretending to be a man my old friends are too busy to listen to me on anything and my co-workers all think I'm queer. I hate that I'd be 100% certain to lose my job if I ever came out to them because it's a christian office. I hate that all of my trans friends I did make no longer have interest in me because treating someone who looks like me with a boy's name online the same way that they treated me before is just weird. 

Even if a miracle happened and I was able to afford treatment to look exactly like I wanted and calm my mind and get all the pretty clothes I wanted, no one would ever be able to see me for me anymore. I've been completely abandoned by everyone I love because I can't act normal and I don't feel right and they never actually did love me in the past either, I was just way over attached to common kindness. 

I can't keep crying every night and feeling so disgusting and filthy and fearing what it means that I have the bad parts of having a male body but nothing anyone ever holds of value in men, I hate hearing her talk about how awful males are and knowing she's including me but excluding the trans girls she loves now. I hate feeling like nothing I say or do can be trusted because of my mental problems and that no one would stay with me even just for fun. 

I hate that it will never fair to any of the rest of you for someone like me to identify as a trans girl because it would make people associate being trans with someone as ugly and messed up and unacceptable as me. I hate that I feel like I'm guilt tripping everyone whenever I try to talk about any of my problems. I hate that there's no easy way for me to just die, I hate that no one will notice if I disappeared they'd just realize they're a lot happier without me around.  I've lost everything, I never had much but at least I had an illusion that I was okay and had love once. I still love her so much but she barely wants to be friends with me anymore and there's nothing I can do to change my situation or help anybody.

My name is Isa, I'm 27, mtf, living with my cis partner in Seattle, and with my 1-year-into-transition and not-unrelated anxiety, I find it hard to meet new people here--surprise surprise! So I guess I'm posting this and joining the forum because I'm hoping to make some new friends and forge some connections in the trans community here in Seattle.

Stuff I like: going to shows at Kremwerk, rewatching Always Sunny/King of the Hill until I die, gradually stealing my partner's extensive makeup collection, board games (Dominion, 7 Wonders, tabletops aplenty), Stardew Valley (and other video games probably), typical outdoorsy BS like hiking and canoeing, listening to and emulating Danny Brown records, leaving lipstick on every glass at snooty cocktail bars (especially ones pretending to be speakeasies), and finding all the Taiwanese food in town in order to relive that one time I went there.

I'm putting this all out there to be like, HI!, but also to say that I would love to do any or all of the above with fellow trans folx in Seattle. I know Ingersoll does weekly meetups, and that places like Raygun Lounge do dedicated queer grrl nights, and I even volunteered for Trans Pride this year--but all that stuff is hard for me to go to when I don't know anyone and don't know what I'm getting myself into.

2017-07-26 21:32:57,6prawd,18,56,"Alright so we all know what this is going to be about. First off; i served four years in the australian military, im a trans woman and im going to rant. Enjoy.

I've been seeing this plastered all up and down my facebook feed and of course ive gone anywhere from seeing arguments about the cost, mental illness, surgeries and bigotry. Its pretty intense out there currently.

But I've got a few points of my own to make, and I'm a tad confused. 

One; I don't think Trumps Trans Ban is about money.

Why? Let's have a look at some figures. In an analysis, wide and varying numbers of the VA budget have been shown to be several numbers viagara and erectile dysfunction - some 40 million and 80 million respectively. But, the cost of transgender health provision will be somewhere in the figures of 2.5 million to 8.5 million per year - disrupting a negligible amount of a military budget that is twice the combined power of many countries after it.

But we aren't talking just about surgery here, we are talking about HRT aswell - testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, spironolactone. Mostly, these drugs costs about $60/month in australia - more in the US due to non public health care. But that shouldn't alarm me more than the drinking habits of soldiers.

In december 2016, it was estimated in a survey that 43% of active duty members were binge drinkers - 67% of those were between 17-25. How much would binge drinking cost the US military? What would be the medical bill for young testosterone pumped men going out and finding trouble on a weekend? Well, it turns out that on average 11,982 service members (that's nearly the full amount of the 15,500 trans members in the US military) need to undergo alcohol reeducation a year- but are we looking at banning alcohol or discharging those members? Where is the storm about alcohol? Why isn't that being banned? How much is the US government paying for soldiers to drink every weekend? Why is binge drinking a more acceptable use of payment than allowing soldiers to purchase hormone replacement therapy? 

Two; Since when, have i been more at risk to be a danger behind a gun because I'm trans?

3 people a day. 3 people a day. Thats the current statistic for police shootings in america - alright, but lets straighten that out; there's no saying how many are criminals and how many are justified and etc etc.  And also, thankyou to our men and women keeping us safe - but seriously, apart from Kristin Beck, who was a SEAL that took part in the Bin Laden raid (god she is a national treasure) how many times do we hear about a trans person shooting someone? Its the same thing with the bathroom problem; there are roughly 700,000 transgender Americans- if being transgender puts the person in the wake of being a pervert, a pedophile, a sex criminal, why aren't we hearing about trans people abusing people in bathrooms? Why isnt it a larger issue? Where are all the headlines about people being assaulted in bathrooms by trans people? Where are they?

Hint; they arent there - trans people are like spiders. We are more afraid of cis people than they are of us. Its the same thing with mental illness and being trans; there is no link between pedophilia, sex crime and mental illness and being transgender. None.

Three; And why is wanting medical treatment an issue anyway? 

Lets think about this  - because this is something im seeing; people dont want me in the military because they are worried that the fact i want to get SRS means im obviously very, very unstable. 

No. The reason i want to get SRS is to be rid of an appendage that doesnt suit my body anymore- on anti androgens, it becomes more difficult to achieve and maintain an errection. Your penis may or may not become something of a useless appendage, which is reason enough to have it surgically altered, not counting dysphoria. 

And no; i actually cant be under the influence of mental incapacity when i elect for SRS. Why? Because i have to visit a psychiatrist who had to assess that i am under no mental duress that prevents me from thinking clearly about the decision and preventing it from being an informed and rational medical choice. 

Four; Being transgender isnt a social experiment. 

Neither is gay. Or black. Or smart. Or allowing the infantry to mix with the non apes or whatever. Let's put it this way; if trans people can use the bathroom of their choice, there won't need to be excessive bathroom schemes - again; most trans people are downright terrified of cis people. We seriously fucking are. We will avoid public bathrooms all together most of the time. All we want; to go use the bathroom in peace and not be noticed doing so. Its fucking terrifying. Please, for the love of god just ignore us.


Its bedazzled and really thrown me - i really dont get it; why do people hate me so much? What have i literally done to make people so fucking outraged by my existence? What have any of my brothers and sisters done to deserve this? 

I am NOT a pervert. I am NOT a pedophile, a basket case or anything else - im no more a threat to society than say, an egomaniac in control of the most powerful country on earth.

Dr. Dhejne has [**emphatically denounced**](http://transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) these kinds of misrepresentation of her work. Her study found only that trans people who transition *prior to 1989* had slightly higher rates of suicide attempts than the general public (but still far lower than pre-transition levels), and that trans people post-transition have slightly higher rates of needing mental health services. The study specifically identified abuse and discrimination as the cause of these differences.

Since the interview in which she spelled out why these misrepresentations of her work are wrong is from The TransAdvocate, I've seen people claim the source isn't valid and the interview is fraudulent. I look forward to linking to a reddit AMA thread to show why this bullshit is wrong in the future.

I think I pass most of the time, even given my size. Im 6ft tall, which in itself isnt to bad,  but my frame is on the large size.

Something I do get a lot is that 'I feel bad for you, sympathy look'. You know the one, when they realize you are trans so they just feel bad for you. I have never has anyone abuse me or get angry at me irl. The worst i have gotten is a dirty look. 
Online is a different story, if i use my voice in game chats it is very rare that i dont get abused.

I have been struggling with dysphoria a lot recently and had a suicide attempt 1.5 months ago. 
I dont know what to do. I've considered getting voice surgery but when i mention it to my friends they all say i dont need it your voice is fine. 
But of course they are not going to say anything that could hurt me as it is well known how fragile i can be
