So here goes.. 

I'm a 26 y/o female from the Philippines who is in a 5 yr (turning 6 on Feb) relationship with a transman   who is also from the Philippines. I came from a quite religious old traditioned  and conservative family because my parents grew up in the province. When I was in my teenage years, I started dating boys but my parents were against it. In the Philippines, parents can be very strict. When I was in my last year in college i met a lesbian who is now my boyfriend (currently transitioning to transman) To be honest I never imagined myself being in a same sex relationship. I was all about boys then. I didn't enter this relationship because I got my heart broken with by guy, no. It just felt right. My parents knew about it and they got mad with the cursing and all and it just hurts so bad that they judge the person just because he's a transman. They are so disgusted they have so many comments about it! They are really against this whole same sex relationship because they say nothing good comes out of it. That I am destroying my future because I am inlove with him. (For the record they don't know the different between lesbians and trans) That God didn't make gays and lesbians only man and woman and all that shit that homophobic people say. So from then on I just told them we broke up just to shut them up, so no more issues. Then I moved out of the country with my boyfriend. 

Fast forward to 5 yrs, we are happily living together BUT still without the knowledge of my parents. I have been keeping it from them for years because I wanted to protect him from all the hurtful words my parents will say to him. My relationship with my boyfriend has matured that now we are thinking of a future, our own family together. It has been bothering me for days if now is the right time to tell them everything. Of course I am so scared of what might happen after. And i am pretty much sure they would want me to choose: them or my boyfriend. I never wanted that to happen because he is my family now, 

What do I have to do for them to accept me? Us? I wanted to prove to them that he has never put me in any danger and that my future with him is as bright as sunshine. Because i think for them having my own children and having their own grand children is like the greatest achievement. Ok I want that too but with him, and when I am totally ready. I have found my soulmate, the love of my life but why do i feel like my own parents want me to be unhappy and be with someone that I don't love. I don't know anymore.

2017-11-03 10:29:46,7aiivr,2,1,"I've recently been covering depersonalization disorder - persistent feelings that the world is unreal or colorless, that you don't really feel your emotions, that you just watch yourself robotically going through the motions of life. I've previously called this ""indirect gender dysphoria"". This is a dissociative symptom that's difficult to describe, but it's linked to significant mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Depersonalization may also be up to 18 times more common in trans people - frequent enough that it may be considered an understudied aspect of the experience of gender dysphoria. See more about this research here: https://genderanalysis.net/depersonalization/

In my discussions with psychiatrists who specialize in neurochemistry, we've found that depersonalization symptoms are likely linked to the NMDA receptor and are often treated experimentally with Lamictal (which is also used to counteract the dissociative NMDA antagonist drug ketamine), with some promising results. Estrogen also appears to act on NMDA and seems a likely candidate for the neurochemical basis of the marked and rapid effect of HRT on mitigating dissociative symptoms. If this is the case, then we would have reason to investigate the possibility that Lamictal could serve as an add-on treatment to HRT when significant mental health difficulties are still present.

2017-11-06 11:22:55,7b4jh2,2,5,"Hi guys

This is my first ever post on Reddit

My fiance is secretly a MtF transgendered woman. She doesn't feel comfortable coming out of the closet because 

1) her field of work is a male dominated field that is difficult to get into as it is

2) she's afraid of being discriminated against and unaccepted by the people she loves (I.e. friends and family)

3) She has a hard time managing her mental health now as a man and feels like coming out would crush her spirit (she would lose many of her supports, both family and friends.... conservative family, conservative field of work) and she is self conscious/socially anxious already without being treated differently based on her appearance

Right now she crossdresses in the evenings and on the weekends. I help her with her make up and outfits and nails. We've bought wigs and padding and shoes and sex toys to help her feel as womanly as possible when we have the opportunity to let her be herself. It can be hard because we have tenants that share our property.

She's gone online to try and find friends who might accept her as her real self but a lot of people online see her solely as a cross dresser and treat her like she's a fetish or a sex doll. What she really wants are friends who understand her and support her and will keep her secret 

It can be hard here in the LGBTQ community because it is such a small place... once one person joins the community is spreads like wildfire. She wants to keep things under wraps. Also because she is publically identifying as a man, some people view her situation with skepticism. 

I guess what I'm wondering is how best to support her? I know she would love to transition but feels like she can't. It's her choice what she wants to do and I accept that and support her regardless. But I would love for her to be able to make friends and talk about what she's going through and feel normal.

Are there any sites where Mia could feel supported and make a connection with people who are going through a similar situation? I really want her to be happy and I think having a connection with a community that understands her would really help.

Thanks for reading

I come from a pretty conservative family, so I got very used to blocking out feelings that would be inconvenient for me to have at a young age. That's why I've only been able to admit to my bisexuality a year ago. But once I admitted that, some other feelings started to come up. I started looking in the mirror and wishing my hips were wider, I started getting increasingly annoyed at my body hair, my coarse skin, my wide shoulders. If I ever let myself grow facial hair, I get very depressed. I am extremely conscious of my vocal inflection, how low my voice is, how big my hands and feet are, how giant my Adam's apple is. I started looking up ways to dress and exercise to make my shoulders look thinner and my hips look wider, I shave pretty much my entire body except my head, I pay more attention to my posture, I stole a skirt from my sister just to try on every once in a while, I bought panties that I wear under my pants just for comfort sometimes, I started plucking my eyebrows and using some light makeup to give myself a slightly thinner looking face and I'm not really sure why any of these things feel right, but they do. I started looking back on my life and noticing that I had wanted to do a lot of these things before and just hadn't because they were ""wrong"" or ""dirty"". I remember being made fun of for ""walking and talking like a girl"" when I was a little kid and I remember my parents yelling at me when I let my sisters do my makeup. I'm kinda shocked I blocked this stuff out by the time high school came around. 

Over the past year, I haven't wanted to label any of this. It's a big enough wrench in my life hiding my sexuality from my parents while they pay for most of my college. 

I recently started asking myself a bunch of hypothetical questions like, ""If you could turn your body into a girl's right now with no consequences, would you?"" and ""Would you want to be a girl all the time?"" and ""Would you be a girl if it meant losing most of your old friends?"" and ""What if you could change your sexual features at a moment's notice? How often would you change from a guy to a girl? Would you rather be something in the middle?"" I don't know the answer for sure to a lot of these questions, but I know I would not only be a guy if I had that kind of choice. 

I didn't want to address this for awhile, at least until I was independent and on my own. But I've been getting more and more depressive episodes lately, where I just can't get out of bed for 2 or 3 days at a time. I talked to a therapist but I haven't brought up anything beyond my sexuality. I'm afraid this gender stuff might be the reason I get so depressed, like this thing that makes me happy is going to destroy the life I've built and there's nothing I can do about it. 

I finally broke down and told my best friend about this. They told me if I was unsure whether I was a trans woman or nb or just a crossdresser, I should start reading and listening and talking to as many people with similar experiences as I could. 

As much as I'd like someone to read this and say, ""Yep, you're definitely trans,"" or ""Nah, you're not trans,"" what I'm really asking for is if anyone here has similar experiences or if anyone has some good reading material I can look into with people's experiences on this stuff.

Also, I’m changing my name ASAP because I need something more masculine. I’m going with August.

This is strange and don't know what to make what is going on with me. I recently came out bisexual last year and started exploring my sexuality. I use to crossdress when I was younger and stopped after I got caught dressed up in my sister's dress in a g string doing anal play. When I dress up it fills me with emotions that I never feel. I could be dressed up for awhile and be happy. I hid my feeling from everyone even me liking guys. I have really no interest topping guys because I feel more alive and feminine when I bottom. I still am highly attracted to women but I feel like I over think it when it comes to women. I feel like I would be more dominate with women but submissive with men. I grew up in a masculine household that was semi homophobic so I felt uncomfortable that I would be found out. For these things, I think I struggle with Masculinity and Feminity as a person. On the outside I am a tall, hairy, and masculine features but on the inside I wish I could just throw on a dress and a pair of heels and just act girly. I feel lost at the moment because I feel like I have a man and woman fighting each other inside me and no one wins.

2017-11-13 12:16:50,7cmpkb,5,4,"This is gonna be a *LONG* post. The end kind of summarizes my point, but I can't condense it further. Sorry.

I saw a Twitter post today that, while it clearly resonated with others, kind of terrifies me:

""...HRT does just as much (if not more) for [trans people] mentally as it does physically. We are not taking hormones merely to pass. We're taking them because there is a noticeable, measurable relief it gives our brains.""

Some of the replies included remarks like ""living before hrt felt like living under a heavy sheet of oppression,"" and I'm so, so glad for those people that they now feel comfortable. But I'm not sure I feel like that.

I've always been good at ignoring my body's signals. I've stayed up days at I time because night came and I was too in the middle of something to sleep. I've gone all day without eating because I just plain didn't notice. I've let my feet fall completely asleep because I noticed the signal they were tingling and wasn't ready to move yet. I went years without noticing that the disgust when I saw my chest had nothing to with how my breasts looked and instead had to do with the fact that I had them.

Realizing I was nonbinary awakened me to the regular dysphoria I'd already experienced and ignored. I didn't notice I was uncomfortable with one set of pronouns until I noticed I was more comfortable with another. I've rapidly come to discover that in addition to a flat chest, I craved facial hair, and a deeper voice. I craved androgyny.

Years ago, I was in a very bad place. The stress of trying to pass high school with an undiagnosed disability and years of emotional abuse and neglect left me with depression and social anxiety I was self-harming to cope with. A year ago almost to the date, I took LSD with my partner and gained a new perspective on life that really helped me manage my anxiety, and in turn, I found ways to get over my depression. I haven't been in as bad a mental place since then, and I really don't intend to return.

My pronouns make me happy, but my body does not. I love myself and my appearance, I just wish with all my heart it was different, in ways that are most easily achieved through transition. But I'm not in a bad mental place. I'm out to almost everyone close to me, and accepted by everyone I've told. I'm very lucky I'm that regard. As much as I yearn for the physical changes testosterone would bring, I don't always feel trapped by estrogen.

There are days when I don't mind my feminine features as much. Days when I worry that facial hair would ruin my looks. *Then,* there are days when I don't even want to talk to myself, let alone others, because the pitch of my voice makes me want to curl up and die. Days when hearing service workers call me ""ma'am"" and ""miss"" turns my heart inside out. I'm just. Afraid, I guess.

I'm not so much afraid of the effects of testosterone. I've asked myself over and over if the worst of the effects would be worth it, and the answer's come back yes every time. I'm just afraid that HRT won't be the panacea everyone makes it out to be. I'm afraid I've misinterpreted myself again, that even though I'm not a boy and I'm definitely not a girl, I'm not an androgyne either.

...I'm afraid I'm not broken enough to need fixing.

The number of people who that tweet resonated with, who described it as taking a weight off their shoulders... I'm afraid it wouldn't do that for me. I don't know that it could because I don't know if such a weight exists. I only know the perspective I have now. Trying HRT and discovering that it doesn't make me any happier, or worse, that it actively makes me unhappy, would leave me confused and distraught and with an identity crisis the likes of which I've never faced.

I need to do SOMETHING. I can't keep binding forever; eventually it's going to cause permanent damage to either my breasts (jeopardizing surgery) or my lungs (jeopardizing my singing) and I'd rather suffer daily dysphoria than deal with permanent pain, but really I'd rather not deal with it at all. Both HRT and top surgery are enormous undertakings that require total dedication though, and I can't be *that* certain until I have the perspective that doing one or the other brings more satisfaction than not.

I guess I'm looking for advice. Or encouragement. Or just. A different perspective. Someone who's gone through something similar. I'm neither strong nor brave enough to pioneer my own journey.

2017-11-14 19:12:22,7cxygy,0,10,"Any researcher, doctor, or medical professional with experience in the areas of depersonalization disorder, the glutamatergic system, negative/cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia, transition treatment, or estrogen/testosterone action on the nervous system may be able to help here. 

Background: Depersonalization is a cluster of distressing symptoms broadly described as ""feelings of unreality"" - a sense of separation from one's emotions, feeling the world is flat or lifeless or lacking in depth, obsessive ruminations about the nature of reality, feeling split into an observer in your head who narrates events and a participator who moves about in the world, feeling that you're robotic or like a ""zombie"" or even ""dead"". This can become a chronic syndrome, usually beginning in adolescence or sometimes earlier, and is highly distressing and associated with significantly elevated depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts, and severe impairments in school, employment, and relationships. Transgender people are several times more likely than the general population to suffer depersonalization disorder, and studies have found that transitioning, specifically HRT, reduces these symptoms in both trans men and trans women. Many trans people broadly share this experience of living a ""deadened"" life before transition, then feeling ""alive"" for the first time, often in the first few weeks or months after starting - a profound experience that often helps affirm for us the rightness of our gender and our choice to transition, and enables us to have a more full and enjoyable life that we'd been deprived of before.

Depersonalization disorder is notoriously difficult to treat among cis people, which makes the efficacy of transition an outlier. At the same time, some trans people continue to experience depersonalization after starting transition, and others may not be able to access transition treatments for various reasons. At least one study has speculated that these dissociative symptoms are so common that they may in fact be an inherent part of gender dysphoria itself. Treatment of this psychiatric symptom could be as beneficial to us as HRT is in relieving bodily dysphoria. For this reason, I've been investigating the potential role of add-on treatments that could help with this, starting from what's known about treatment of depersonalization disorder and what's known about the psychiatric effects of hormones.

Science nerdiness ahead: Estrogen is known to enhance NMDA function, and is also used as an add-on treatment in schizophrenia (in which the glutamate system is now known to be heavily implicated). There's also an observed overlap between some of the ""anomalous self-experiences"" of depersonalization disorder and the negative/cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia - emotional blunting, avolition, alogia, lack of spontaneity, and consequent severe difficulties with employment and life in general. Lamotrigine (Lamictal), an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer, is increasingly used as a key element of treatment of depersonalization disorder, and also modulates glutamate. Additionally, one major depersonalization researcher, Dr. Daphne Simeon, has received grants for trials of the NMDA glycine-site partial agonist D-cycloserine as an experimental treatment, and has recommended to patients that they supplement with the amino acid glycine in doses similar to that used in adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia (0.8g/kg/day, or on average about 60 grams a day). I've also spoken with a psychiatrist who suggested that D-serine and sarcosine (N-methylglycine), which are also used in add-on treatments of schizophrenia, could be used for depersonalization.

I've been speaking with other doctors in the know about this kind of thing, and we have a sort of budding NMDA hypothesis of transgender depersonalization coming together here. It also has some notable shortcomings and contrary evidence. It does not seem to account for the experiences of trans men. Trans men and trans women appear to experience depersonalization at the same rate, and trans men experience the same decrease in symptoms after testosterone as trans women do after estrogen. In the general population, depersonalization disorder has a 1:1 gender ratio, and there's currently no indication of any pattern of estrogen having any kind of protective effect as seen in schizophrenia.

Quite simply, I don't have the requisite background knowledge or experience to meaningfully account for this or tie this whole theory together any more neatly. But there seem to be the beginnings of something here, something that may usefully pan out into better treatment for at least some of us. So my questions are: Does anyone here know of anything that could hint toward a better understanding of how these various systems, symptoms, and treatments function together? Is there anything that, biochemically, accounts for the efficacy of testosterone in reducing these symptoms in trans men? (The HPA axis has also been marked as potentially involved in depersonalization symptoms, if that could be relevant.) And if there are any psychiatrists or other doctors with relevant expertise here, would you be willing to get in touch and look over the evidence base we've accumulated and offer your opinion of whether add-on treatment with these glycine modulators could be recommended for trans people with depersonalization?

I've been investing the differences in how people smell, based on biological sex. The biggest difference observable by just sniffing, is that cis male BO smells more like stinky cheese, and cis female BO smells like sulphur and onions. The difference is caused by different proportions of compounds in the sweat, which affects which odor chemicals are produced by the bacteria metabolizing sweat. 

The other component that people notice, possibly on a less conscious level, are some chemicals that testosterone and estrogen metabolize into. These are sometimes called human pheromones, and some (cis?) people find that wearing extra of the ones associated with their assigned at birth gender affects how people respond to them - levels of flirting, respect, etc.

The ""pheromones"" are already used as ingredients in commercial perfumes, generally marketed as a way to attract a date. The stinky cheese sweat chemical has also been used in commercial fragrances (though I don't know *why*...) and the estrogen-dominant sweat smell might be, too. This doesn't mean /too/ much about safety, because fragrances are practically unregulated in the US, but it implies that making a cologne that makes a person smell more like an un-perfumed person with the opposite dominant hormone might be possible.

Does this seem worth pursuing? I'm considering investing the time and money to figure out how to do this, especially if it might be useful to others, but I'm not sure if smell has enough of an effect to be worth it, or if this might have risks I'm not aware of.

2017-11-20 01:05:27,7e5331,12,9,"I'm going to be candid.  I have no idea what I'm doing.  But I feel so goddamn alone right now and I could really benefit from someone hearing my story.  So I guess I'll post this on Reddit and see if anything good comes of it.  

Hey everyone, cis straight male here.  I'm 19 years old and very, very confused.  But I'll take a deep breath and start from the very beginning.

I was born to a religious family.  Raised Mormon, in a household that felt kind of devoid of paternal presence and such.  I was the lonely brother, outnumbered by three sisters, my mother stayed at home and my father worked day in, day out.  I'm number 3 of 4 and in my second year of college.

Anyway, being raised Mormon, my world view was narrow and built for me.  There were certain fundamental truths that defined my life and my interactions, i.e. there is a universal, undeniable truth and good and morality.  And one of those was that God created each and every human being precisely as he wanted, and that genders and gender roles exist for a reason.  They are a part of one's divine destiny and to go against such destiny is blasphemy.  I mean, I never really thought too much of it.  I never really sought any of those huge truths for myself; I more or less went to church because my family did.  For a time, I think I did believe, but I guess it's obvious that I don't anymore.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, here.  Ever since I was little, I've had this strong desire to be something other than what I am.  When I was a toddler, I wanted to be a dog... when I was eight, I wanted to be a Pokemon.  And I suppose this all culminated at the point I reached a few years ago... that I wanted to be a girl.

I'm not one of those people who had a childhood in which they always wanted to play with dolls or dress up and their father simply didn't let them.  My toys were dinosaurs and cars and legos (I know that it's not right to categorize toys into 'girl' vs 'boy' but hey, the psychology and stuff suggests that there is a difference), and I was actually terrified of my sisters' Barbies.  When I was little, I first wanted to be a firefighter, then a veterinarian.  I don't think I had aspirations to be anything other than what my parents said was normal, and no one's childhood recollection is super accurate so I'm trying to remain objective, compare what I remember with my mother's account.  But as far as she says, I was a normal, healthy, happy child, and I fit in well with all the other boys my age.

There are weird things I remember that always made me feel a little out of place, like the fact that Wurmple was my favorite pokemon because it was so stinkin' cute, and my friends all laughed at me for that, instead opting for the more badass ones, y'know, little things like that.  Once everyone started hitting puberty, I was tiny compared to my male peers.  I got picked on relentlessly because I was horrendous in our P.E. games and didn't know how to throw a football.  I remember my dad trying to teach me how to throw a punch and being disappointed that I couldn't land a good one.  And those bullies always attacked my masculinity calling me the classic middle school insults.  At one point, one called me out for holding my books like a girl with them close to my chest.  They said I ran like a girl and threw like a girl.

I watched a lot of TV when I was little, mostly Nickelodeon.  There was some show called 'Mr. Meaty' and while I never watched it, I saw a handful of commercials for it.  There was one episode where they had the 'girly burger' or something like that with some special 'girl sauce' on it.  Anyway, the male characters accidentally ingested some and became female temporarily.  All I remember was chills down my spine, a whispered 'I want that' in the back of my mind.

There was the episode of Drake and Josh where Drake jokingly suggests that Josh become a woman to get out of some crazy misfortune they found themselves in.  And I remember getting chills again, finding out that a transition is actually possible, and then I dreamed of it for the next few days.  This episode broke that predetermined set of values that I had inherited from my faith and asserted that just because I am a male does not mean I necessarily need to be one.  And I found that exhilarating.

Granted, I was still very young.  These experiences are from my elementary school days, and these ideas quickly faded from mind.  But later when the bullying picked up and I found myself all alone, I wondered what the hell made me such an odd fit with my peers.  And I don't know if I'm just remembering it incorrectly, but today, I think it was my feminine disposition that they picked up on and drilled me for.

So I guess that'll suffice for the 'early life' section of this wikipedia page.  Everything henceforth is from (give or take) the past 5 years.

My sophomore year of high school, I began to have firm doubts about my faith, and by junior year, I decided I wanted nothing to do with it.  But I never told my family.  I persisted in the church, keeping up this facade that I was the good, faithful Mormon boy.  I lived under that guise for way too long, I even spent my first year of college and Brigham Young University to keep it up until that institution finally broke my spirits and I transferred to a state school.  But with this identity shattered, I was left to discover myself as an individual, to discover my own beliefs and philosophies, etc.  I was so lost.  I putted around, sank deep into depression and was barely saved by my tiny circle of friends.  I just felt so alone, like I'd never be understood, that I could never afford to reveal myself to my family because of how they'd respond.  I knew my apostasy would break their hearts and I just couldn't stand to witness that.

So I persisted, going to church and all that.  But there was a point in my senior year where I think all this dysphoria finally caught up to me.  I've always been self-conscious about my body, wearing shirts at the beach and in the pool, and once I was largely finished with puberty, I had some excess breast tissue.  It wasn't that much and I still have it today, but it was certainly noticeable.  The very few times they saw me shirtless, my friends would comment on how huge or floppy my nipples were and that always made me feel godawful.

So I tried working it off, using the rowing machine in the basement, running outside, cross fit... but none of it worked.  And one night, when I couldn't sleep, I just stood in the bathroom and stared at my naked body, crying at what I saw.  And throughout my life, I've had a lot of thoughts that I would be better off female, but I think this is the first time I REALLY thought it.  Like I would've accepted an offer to switch in a heartbeat.

The thought scared me, even though it made sense.  I opened my laptop, my first instinct was to search for some test I could take that would tell me definitively whether or not I was trans.  Something came up, I did it, and it declared me androgynous.  I cried myself to sleep that night and fell into one of my deepest depressive slumps and this question was the foremost in my mind.

I spend that summer depressed as hell.  I was working for my dad and the job sucked ass, I was having this internal battle of whether my body agrees with my identity, and I was still keeping up this image of the loyal, religious son.  And that fall, I set out for BYU.

I never told anyone any of this.  I'd heard my parents talk about depression in very scathing, stigmatizing words.  They said depressed kids were just entitled pricks looking for a handout, so I obviously didn't go to them.  But I had a high school friend who had recently left her family's faith, so I called her up when I couldn't bear to keep pretending.

I told my parents via written letter and talked about it over the coming weeks and months with them.  Things got bad, then they started to get better.  And then I was hit with this wave of dysphoria again, on top of this crisis.

I called the same friend from before and told her between sobs.  She was so sympathetic and understanding and told me that I can't force an answer to a question like this.  I had to pull a Doctor Strange and submit myself to the forces, rather than trying to manipulate them.  So that's what I tried to do, and it only got me so far.  I entered a cycle of ""alright, I'm good, gonna be a male, hoo-ha"" to ""if there was a god, I would've been born a girl..."" so on and so forth.

I left BYU with these questions still on my mind.  In my dreams, I would be female, in a handful I was just cross-dressed.  I had dreams about my mother and letting her down and I just couldn't stand to do that.  There was the moment of bliss when I looked in the mirror and saw a confident woman stare back, but also the moment of despair when my mom saw right through me.

Arrive summer, I started working at Chipotle, and in the mornings I was home alone.  So I'd work on a feminine voice, then, and eventually I decided to try cross-dressing for the first time in my life.  And I loved it.  I did it for hours, in and out of my mom's closet, twirling in the mirror.  I watched vlogs of post-procedure trans women and felt so uplifted.  That summer, I frequented a therapist who helped me talk out my family and religion issues, though I was extremely hesitant to voice my gender concerns and didn't tell her until our remaining visits were very numbered.  Then I left for college again.

And I guess that more or less brings us to the present.  The dysphoria comes and goes, but right now I'm in a slump.  I want insight, questions, just anything to help me feel like I'm not alone in this.  If you can help me figure this out, I'd love to hear what you have to say.  If this is something I just need to figure out for myself, please help me do that.  The biggest thing, I guess, is that I'm just so goddamn afraid.  I'm terrified that I'll make the wrong choice and regret it forever, or that I'll be ousted by my family and what few friends I have.  I'm worried I'll never be able to pass as a woman, and that I'll be too embarrassed to go outside when I'm in the middle of transitioning.

tl;dr: I don't feel like I fit the stereotypical trans girl mold, but I'm in crisis and could use some insight.

Thanks so much ahead of time.",trans,My Story (Please help me),1511165127.0,"{'created_utc': 1511139927, 'id': '7e5331', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'I\'m going to be candid.  I have no idea what I\'m doing.  But I feel so goddamn alone right now and I could really benefit from someone hearing my story.  So I guess I\'ll post this on Reddit and see if anything good comes of it.  \n\nHey everyone, cis straight male here.  I\'m 19 years old and very, very confused.  But I\'ll take a deep breath and start from the very beginning.\n\nI was born to a religious family.  Raised Mormon, in a household that felt kind of devoid of paternal presence and such.  I was the lonely brother, outnumbered by three sisters, my mother stayed at home and my father worked day in, day out.  I\'m number 3 of 4 and in my second year of college.\n\nAnyway, being raised Mormon, my world view was narrow and built for me.  There were certain fundamental truths that defined my life and my interactions, i.e. there is a universal, undeniable truth and good and morality.  And one of those was that God created each and every human being precisely as he wanted, and that genders and gender roles exist for a reason.  They are a part of one\'s divine destiny and to go against such destiny is blasphemy.  I mean, I never really thought too much of it.  I never really sought any of those huge truths for myself; I more or less went to church because my family did.  For a time, I think I did believe, but I guess it\'s obvious that I don\'t anymore.\n\nBut I\'m getting ahead of myself, here.  Ever since I was little, I\'ve had this strong desire to be something other than what I am.  When I was a toddler, I wanted to be a dog... when I was eight, I wanted to be a Pokemon.  And I suppose this all culminated at the point I reached a few years ago... that I wanted to be a girl.\n\nI\'m not one of those people who had a childhood in which they always wanted to play with dolls or dress up and their father simply didn\'t let them.  My toys were dinosaurs and cars and legos (I know that it\'s not right to categorize toys into \'girl\' vs \'boy\' but hey, the psychology and stuff suggests that there is a difference), and I was actually terrified of my sisters\' Barbies.  When I was little, I first wanted to be a firefighter, then a veterinarian.  I don\'t think I had aspirations to be anything other than what my parents said was normal, and no one\'s childhood recollection is super accurate so I\'m trying to remain objective, compare what I remember with my mother\'s account.  But as far as she says, I was a normal, healthy, happy child, and I fit in well with all the other boys my age.\n\nThere are weird things I remember that always made me feel a little out of place, like the fact that Wurmple was my favorite pokemon because it was so stinkin\' cute, and my friends all laughed at me for that, instead opting for the more badass ones, y\'know, little things like that.  Once everyone started hitting puberty, I was tiny compared to my male peers.  I got picked on relentlessly because I was horrendous in our P.E. games and didn\'t know how to throw a football.  I remember my dad trying to teach me how to throw a punch and being disappointed that I couldn\'t land a good one.  And those bullies always attacked my masculinity calling me the classic middle school insults.  At one point, one called me out for holding my books like a girl with them close to my chest.  They said I ran like a girl and threw like a girl.\n\nI watched a lot of TV when I was little, mostly Nickelodeon.  There was some show called \'Mr. Meaty\' and while I never watched it, I saw a handful of commercials for it.  There was one episode where they had the \'girly burger\' or something like that with some special \'girl sauce\' on it.  Anyway, the male characters accidentally ingested some and became female temporarily.  All I remember was chills down my spine, a whispered \'I want that\' in the back of my mind.\n\nThere was the episode of Drake and Josh where Drake jokingly suggests that Josh become a woman to get out of some crazy misfortune they found themselves in.  And I remember getting chills again, finding out that a transition is actually possible, and then I dreamed of it for the next few days.  This episode broke that predetermined set of values that I had inherited from my faith and asserted that just because I am a male does not mean I necessarily need to be one.  And I found that exhilarating.\n\nGranted, I was still very young.  These experiences are from my elementary school days, and these ideas quickly faded from mind.  But later when the bullying picked up and I found myself all alone, I wondered what the hell made me such an odd fit with my peers.  And I don\'t know if I\'m just remembering it incorrectly, but today, I think it was my feminine disposition that they picked up on and drilled me for.\n\nSo I guess that\'ll suffice for the \'early life\' section of this wikipedia page.

2017-11-20 05:28:09,7e6lra,0,1,"I just want to get some stuff off my chest. I've (MtF) been presenting female more regularly now, after 1.5 years on HRT and a lot of tumult in my life that got in the way of focusing on my transition, and somehow my dysphoria has found ways to strike even when I'm feeling happy in my skin.

It's the small things, like watching an episode of Golden Girls and seeing the characters (a bunch of old women) reminisce about their childhood-- then sobbing for a while because I feel wrong for not having had any prototypical girl experiences in my youth. 

What it comes down to is a struggle to own my life experience as being 'womanly.' I stay stuck in a mindspace where I feel broken instead, 'built wrong' such that I can't fit as anything-- I can more easily talk about growing up with men, and only other trans people can nod in understanding when I explain the mess my adulthood became due to dysphoria. I have no touchpoints with the average ciswomen other than a handful of relatively superficial things like makeup skills, whining about estrogen-fueled moods, and having been taken advantage of by a friend in college (fucked up that that's a touchpoint, but experience has shown me it is; society's screwed but that's a different conversation).

I guess I'm also just uncomfortable about the concept of a 'trans experience' because it furthers the concept that there's two kinds of women, trans and cis-- to me at least 'trans' and 'cis' should just be to clarify whether one was assigned their proper gender at birth or not, I don't want them to refer to two distinct life experiences. And yet it seems I'm experiencing empirical evidence that they do.

Is this the price of going through the wrong puberty? I imagine for trans people who never go through the wrong puberty and go through most of their childhood as the correct gender, this is much less an issue. Maybe I'm not experiencing a universally trans thing, just a thing for those of us who are forced to double dip on the delightful (/s) experience of puberty.

This is driving me a bit crazy. I'm sure it will pass and I will grow to accept my life-story, but for now it makes me feel like a sham. I just wanted to share this struggle with y'all cause I'm hoping others have experienced similar issues, and I'd like to hear about it, and also because I needed to talk more about it, to bleed out some of the poison.",trans,Needed vent,1511180889.0,"{'created_utc': 1511155689, 'id': '7e6lra', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""I just want to get some stuff off my chest.

Why not? Obviously, none of yall should kill yourselves. But why shouldn't I? 

It sounds silly maybe but there doesn't really seem to be any logic to it. I'll try to cheer people up, tell them they will see the light, because I don't want them to die, but there's no logic behind it. It's just some vague feeling I have.

I want yall alive simply because I love you. If I didn't, I literally would not care if you died.

If I don't love myself, where is the reason for being alive?

Every answer seems really shallow/trivial. People's sadness? It'll pass, time heals all wounds and all that. On a tiny scale that's irrelevant, on a large scale too. Experimenting all of life's wonders? It's not like I'll be full of regret when I'm dead. 

The concept of death itself seems absurd. Being alive seems kind of boring and tedious, so what's the point? 

It's not that I'd rather be dead, it's just being alive seems so... lackluster that it's not worth it. Being dead is a matter of perspective. Since I can only ever access my own, I will simply be not alive. sarcastic ""oh no"".

Like, this isn't some cry for help or comfort (not that there's anything wrong with needing help : ), I just fail to grasp the logic behind ""alive"". 

I won't be able to cheer y'all up, which is admittedly sad, but that only matters to me because I am ""alive"".

Is my contribution to this world a positive one? Perhaps. But assuming it is, so what? I only care about said contribution because I'm alive. And yes that's a selfish perspective. Because I have a self.

It's a bit of a catch 22 (maybe? I get that wrong a lot); I need to be selfless to want live but I can only truly be selfless by killing my self.

Can I kill my self without killing myself (as the buddha did)? doesn't seem like a reliable solution tbh

I think I’m trans. I’m not sure if I’ve always thought I was trans. I have reason to believe I always thought I was a guy (when I was younger I wrote stories about being a guy, and I wrote songs to girls and stuff), but I may be wrong, I dont remember my childhood well. 

I’m scared this is just a fad I’ll grow out of, but when I was younger I starved myself a bit to prevent chest development, and I worked out a little too much for a 13 year old. 

I’m doing my best to not describe behaviors, because that’s stereotypical (though stereotypically, I was/am more masculine).

The other day I got to thinking about not having a Y chromosome and I got really sad, because I’ll never know my whole genetic lineage, but it left me thinking- If I could have both XY chromosomes, and thus be a man, but look the same (present female) or present masculine, but have XX chromosomes, I think I would prefer to have XY chromosomes. 
Though i hate getting called “ma’am” and “Ms.” I’d rather know internally who I am is real... if that makes sense.

I feel so disrespected. 

My dad has no real fault here, besides not using my name and pronouns despite knowing them.

Every time I act like myself, she gives me ***the look*** she’s disappointed in me and says “You never did XYZ before.” 

*“You wore a dress six months ago.”*

Yeah, I also wished for nothing but the bitter embrace of death six months ago. 

Now, this has been going on for some time, and whatever, I can take it. I’m strong, but what truly brings forth my fury is their racism, transphobia, homophobia, and inability to look beyond themselves and give some human compassion. 

I don’t even want to type some of the things they’ve said about minorities, and you know what’s great? ***We’re also a minority*** (I’m Latino). 

They’ll stare at a person until they can figure out their birth sex, and then use those pronouns- even when the person presents and makes clear that they would prefer otherwise.

My father almost makes me hate being a man because of how he regards women sometimes.

I say all this not because I’m mad at them (I am), but because I’m mad at myself. 

I could stand up to them when they’re being jerks to other humans, and I often do, but I’m not doing enough. I’m 18, I could theoretically leave. I could go and start hormones and be done with this. 

But I haven’t. I have 3,000 dollars ( I had 8,000 but they took 5,000 from me when I was a minor). I could leave and never come back. 

But I don’t. They’re going to pay for my college, and as much as I can’t stand how much control they’ll have (they don’t want me to transition. I’m going to anyways), they’re going to let me leave for college. I want to have a financially stable career. I want to see if I can help the world some. 

I have a plan- I’m going to file as independent next year for financial aid. I’m only going to socially transition this first year. After that, they can’t tell me anything. 

I fucking hate myself sometimes. I hate my situation. 

Side note: anyone know of some careers with good pay? I’m into just about every topic under the sun. Thanks.

2017-11-28 01:27:31,7g0bpt,6,3,"Hi everyone, 

I would like to get the opinion of some of the lovely people on here :)

I have lived my whole life without questioning my manhood. However, ever since puberty, I have always had sexual fantasies about being in a womans body in sexual situations. So basically when I masturbate I tend to imagine myself as the woman in the porn I am watching or even having sex with my girlfriend, I sometimes as I imagine myself as her. For a really long time I thought those fantasies meant that I was gay. However, I am not attracted to men, and I am definitely attracted to women. So I really don't see how that could be the case. So recently I posted in a facebook group dedicated to sexual fantasies asking if people thought my own fantasies were weird, and a handful of people suggested that I was trans and didn't realize it. Others suggested it would be damaging to my mental health for others to inform me I am trans because I have been having these fantasies my whole life, because gender identiy is a completely seperate entity than sexual orientation. For the latter reason, I don't want to jump into assuming I am trans if it is not necessarily the case. However, without jumping to conclusions, I am trying to be as open minded here as possible, So I have a few questions, /r/trans : 

-What kind of things do I need to be asking myself(or possible experiment with) to allow me to discover whether or not I am trans? I don't know where to start which makes it extremely hard for me to explore this. 
-Has anyone else had a similar fantasy that eventually led to them realizing that they were trans?
-If I we're trans, would I simply know it? Is the fact that I am unsure a sign that I am not?

Hello, I'm 18 and come from Poland. Since I was 10, or even younger, i remember thinking of myself as a girl. This feeling later faded out during puberty, but has been coming stronger than ever since my 18th birthday. I already went through one depression stage at 17, yet recently i just feel like crying every night because being a boy disgusts me. The thing i hate the most is hair. Body hair is awful and i feel awful when i see it at its fullest every day when i shower. I tried shaving it before but just ended up making my places very itchy, so i had to give up on that idea and try and live with it. One thing worth mentioning is that i don't mind having a penis, i'd like it if it was hairless. I don't like my face: it has a squarish, manly face. I get really sad browsing progress pics of some beautiful girls here and realizing ill never look like this. I'd love to get help, but if my parents learned about this, they would probably just alienate me and not help with anything. This is Poland, so i doubt that even medical professionals would be of any help. I want to leave this country as soon as possible: when i finish high school, i dont want to go to a university: this would ensure a few more years like this. i want to seek work in an english speaking country and start an actual life.

Of course everyone is different and will have different tastes but I don't get to see him a lot and I want to make the gift count.

2017-11-29 18:45:14,7gfkfp,13,1,"Hi,

I'm MtF, 6 months with HRT. I work for a large company in the City of London. ""Large"" as in, we are using two floors in the building. There are floor plans all over the place and today I counted the desks in my floor, it's 560 people here. This is in the IT sector so I don't expect there to be 280 women but let's say 200. 180. It doesn't matter.

I'm growing my hair, I paint my nails, I dress like a woman (well, no skirts yet :)) and I even use high heeled shoes. People on the ball should be thinking that there's something going on.

I'm in talks with HR about a broad comms to the company at large regarding my name change and also mentioning my upcoming change in appearance (FFS). The toilet issue will have to be addressed too. I'm the first trans here so HR is lacking some experience about what to say and who to tell. This post is specifically about whether to let every single female in my floor know that I'll soon start using *their* toilet.

* There are women who I work with on a daily basis, they should obviously know. Some of them already know even.
* Women who I don't work with but they sit nearby and we see each other on a daily basis, they should probably know too.
* Women who I talk to maybe once or twice weekly, they should know right?
* Women who I see daily when walking around the workplace (eg. when going to my locker) but I have no other interaction with them. I don't know their names, they don't know mine. I'm that weirdo who looks like a woman. Should HR tell them? Keep in mind that we'll eventually happen to meet in the toilet and they will recognise me.
* Probably, women who work at the opposite corner of the building and we'll never meet except in the toilet. Before the FFS this will be weird at least. Should they know?

A part of me thinks that yes, we should tell all 200 or 180 or whatever females in my floor. But I can't help thinking that that's overkill and some (most?) of them won't care as long as they can go to the restroom in peace.

Do you have any advice about this?

I'm trying to bring my weight down a bunch before they give me the actual E pills, but I'm now waiting on a letter being sent to my doctor so he can write me the prescription. (Which I won't be taking to my local pharmacy, screw that, they're all judgy pricks.)

I'm still a couple weeks off, but I'm free and clear now. Four years of waiting. Let me tell you how my day went.

The start of the day was stressful, horrible and annoying. I woke up at two in the god damn morning after barely sleeping at all, I got showered and made it to the train station with seconds to spare. The train was in, the first ticket machine was being a git and the second one had four people ahead of me. The train was about two minutes for leaving, I start using the machine and stick my card in. Like an idiot I use the wrong PIN the first time so I have to do the whole thing again.

I got my tickets, fucked off up to Edinburgh with about an hour to spare before my appointment, so I decided to go to CEX and buy a bunch of DVD's again. Yeah, I still watch DVD's. Sue me.

After a liberal slathering of purchases and Howl's Moving Castle not being in stock *again* I went up to Chalmers. Now, I'm not gonna lie, I'm a fat bugger, so I wanted a burrito. The burrito van was shut, so my plan to get them before the appointment went out the window. I went on past, went into the clinic to be taken early and then I sit in front of the endo while he talks a bunch about stuff that's not important.

Then he says the thing. I expected to be told I'm too fat and I'd have to lose a couple stone before they'd give me anything. I was right in thinking that, that's the reason they've dodged doing anything for the last nearly two years. This time I was wrong. The dude told me he'd write my doctor to tell him to write me a prescription of T blockers. I was struggling not to smile when he told me, it was the best news I could've hoped for. 

So now I'm on a high, I'm excited, I'm relieved and I wanna go cry happy tears for a change. This is when I got my burritos. I got two, one to give to a family member, then headed off to Primark to have a nosey around for Christmas presents and boxers. I prefer loose underwear, okay? Don't judge me. Especially you back there, I can see you. 

Long story short everything went really well after this. Sure my burrito got poked open by my headphones, but a quick tin foil purchase repaired it and it didn't leak that badly. I got me a quick Maccy D's (not helping the weight loss there, huh?) then hopped on down to the platform for my train. 

There was a guy with a single rose. He sat in a shelter on the platform, a smile on his face as he gazed lovingly at his phone. I got on my train, got sat down and all comfy like. At this point the train hadn't been marked for a destination or anything, but that's fine because it wasn't the wrong train anyway. I looked out the window to see Rose Guy standing waiting while a train pulled in from across Scotland, when it did a bunch of folk got off. That's how trains work. Boom, he finds who he's looking for, gives her the rose and, in a fantastic romantic gesture, they hug and do couple stuff, idk.

My point is it was wholesome AF, especially for the middle of Edinburgh on a busy Tuesday. Oh yeah, this happened Tuesday lmao. Anyway, it was cute and made me smile. Then I smiled about my good news. Smiling topped with a smile sauce, prepared with a happiness I've never felt before when I looked out at Scotland rolling by as I headed home. 

Tuesday was a mixed bag. Sure, I got my clearance for hormones, I got a burrito then I saw some wholesome shit happen. It was great until my aunt took real bad ill and I had to go up to hospital with her and only got home at like 4AM.

2017-11-30 05:37:38,7gk334,2,1,"Hey y'all. Lately I've been questioning my sexuality and now my gender and I'm not really sure why, but it's weird because this has happened before a few years ago, before I met my ex boyfriend. I was in a really weird place mentally, kind of a depression but maybe it was just a place of like being confused about my gender, and all this stuff. But as soon as I found my ex boyfriend, I suddenly felt female again and kind of was embarrassed and scared that I had wanted to be a man so badly. And for a long time I was relishing in being feminine and growing my hair out and feeling pretty and everything. Keep in mind I have no experiences with women in dating, so I don't know if I'd feel this same way with a woman.

Now it's been about half a year since my ex and I broke up, and I've been living with my parents who are narcissists (I'm a frequent poster in the raisedbynarcissists tag lol) so I'm wondering if my gender struggles are around just being depressed and maybe trying to escape into some other personality, like a typical C-PTSD ""freeze"" response, or if actually just being away from men (compulsory heterosexuality) and being single has made me more self-reflective and my true self is trying to finally come out. I don't really feel dysphoria, it's more feeling pleasure at presenting as male, drawing moustaches on myself because I like how it looks, maybe being more nonbinary than transitioning fully to male. Idk, I just worry because I have wanted to be a guy before but I met the ex bf and suddenly all my plans for transitioning flew out the window, ya know? And looking back maybe I've been lying to myself thinking I wanted the whole white-picket fence hetero relationship but really I think I'm like super queer/bi. I know sexuality doesn't have anything to do with gender but it feels like it does while I'm trying to sort it all out. I am wondering if I'm a lesbian, but also I am super attracted to gay men, so I thought maybe it's coming from the male side of me and I am actually a trans man and bisexual. Y'all have any experiences with this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm 24 by the way.",trans,Only feel urge to perform as male when single and depressed?

Lately I\'ve been questioning my sexuality and now my gender and I\'m not really sure why, but it\'s weird because this has happened before a few years ago, before I met my ex boyfriend. I was in a really weird place mentally, kind of a depression but maybe it was just a place of like being confused about my gender, and all this stuff. But as soon as I found my ex boyfriend, I suddenly felt female again and kind of was embarrassed and scared that I had wanted to be a man so badly. And for a long time I was relishing in being feminine and growing my hair out and feeling pretty and everything.
