I've been dating my girlfriend for about six weeks now. Things are going pretty great! She lives about three minutes away from my house, we hang out/date several nights a week. Real solid rapport and companionship has been established in a short amount of time.

We kiss and make out, maybe a little heavy petting, but it never goes any further than that. Any time the topic comes up, she keeps putting it off, stating that it will happen ""somewhere down the line"". 

I get that it's still early in the relationship, but we seem to like and trust each other quite a bit. And we enjoy our ""couch time"". I'm worried though, that she simply doesn't find me attractive in that way, or that perhaps that the estrogen she's been taking for nine years has completely diminished her sex drive.

2017-02-06 22:10:37,5shbi5,15,16,"Hello everyone, 
here is my story, I need some help figuring out what it all means.

I am an 18 year old male. I've always been comfortable being a male. I am by no means the stereotipical boy who likes playing football and cars but I still feel very comfortable being male. I have a wonderful girlfriend which I love very much and it feels natural to be the male partner of the couple. 
Yet I'd also love to be a female. 
Not a mix of the two thing but rather be able to switch between one and the other whenever I feel like it. I would like to be able to wear a dress and high heels like I like to wear a tie for example. 

Very often when I was at home by myself (I don't live there anymore) I would go into my sister's room and dress up as a woman and it felt natural, just like it feels natural to be male.
I would use socks to make the breasts, use a wig, put on a dress that would not show too much of my male body of course and high heels. Whenever I did that, I, for some reason I don't know, got an erection. 

Also I spent hours watching videos of other boys transforming themselves into girls using makeup and other things.

Very often I would also dream about being a female in various occasions. I would also fantasize about it in my head.

What does this mean and what could help me? Is this just attraction to the female side like any heterosexual male is or what is it? I don't feel sexually attracted by other men, I'd just like to be able to be a girl or a boy, whatever I feel like.

I'm too nervous to post in any bigger subreddit, so I was hoping I could reach at least a few people here so I could just connect with some of you who understand what I'm going through.

For the past 18 years (my whole life) I've been living as a guy and for the past 4 years I've been thinking about suicide on a regular basis. I can't remember exactly when all of these feelings really started, but somewhere down the line I realized I wanted to be different. Well, I didn't realize it until high school, but the signs were there. I would dress like a girl when my parents weren't home, I would try on makeup, I would pretend to be a girl online - I did all kinds of things to make myself happy when not much else did. I'm currently living on campus as a first-year university student and I have no idea what to do with my life. I feel a suffocating pressure to come out of the closet before I waste away more of my life, but I have no way of knowing how that will go. My father had told me in the past that he thinks transgender people are ""circus freaks"". How can I possibly face him, or my grandparents, or my friends and tell them this? It's terrifying to even imagine it.

I've considered doing other things like shopping online for clothes that I can wear in private, but even that won't work. I have a roommate sharing this tiny dorm room with me who has no idea that I'm trans. On top of that, I don't have the money to afford clothes on top of school.

I know deep down that the only solution to these problems are to bite the bullet and come out, but it's so hard. It's too hard... I can't stop thinking about my dad's face when he hears about this, or how my brother would react. I can't stop thinking about dedicating so much time and effort into passing as a woman only to have it all fail because of a voice that's too deep or a body that's too masculine. And no matter how many times I tell myself that this is natural and normal, I can't help but see myself as some kind of mistake.

There's so many things that I have to worry about, and life isn't slowing down to let me think through my options with a clear mind. It's so depressing and demoralizing. I've been very depressed recently and I don't really know what I'm looking for with this post... Feeling this way can be very isolating. I feel alone despite having a few cis friends who accept me for who I am. I think about suicide almost every day now, but I don't want to die. I really don't want to die... But right now I'm afraid of living and I'm worried that I'll never be happy in my own skin. I'm worried that I'll never get to be myself. I'm worried that more and more time will pass until I get to the point where my youth is completely spent. I'm scared. 

It's 11:30 PM, I'm crying in bed, and I'm worried that I won't be able to keep this up much longer. Thank you for listening to me, that's really all I've ever wanted. Sorry for the long post, I just had to spill this somewhere. I don't expect anyone to have a miracle fix for all of my problems, I just needed to share these feelings tonight.

And no matter how many times I tell myself that this is natural and normal, I can\'t help but see myself as some kind of mistake.\n\nThere\'s so many things that I have to worry about, and life isn\'t slowing down to let me think through my options with a clear mind. It\'s so depressing and demoralizing. I\'ve been very depressed recently and I don\'t really know what I\'m looking for with this post... Feeling this way can be very isolating. I feel alone despite having a few cis friends who accept me for who I am. I think about suicide almost every day now, but I don\'t want to die. I really don\'t want to die... But right now I\'m afraid of living and I\'m worried that I\'ll never be happy in my own skin. I\'m worried that I\'ll never get to be myself. I\'m worried that more and more time will pass until I get to the point where my youth is completely spent. I\'m scared. \n\nIt\'s 11:30 PM, I\'m crying in bed, and I\'m worried that I won\'t be able to keep this up much longer. Thank you for listening to me, that\'s really all I\'ve ever wanted. Sorry for the long post, I just had to spill this somewhere. I don\'t expect anyone to have a miracle fix for all of my problems, I just needed to share these feelings tonight. Thank you all again, I really appreciate having this respectful place to speak my mind.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Late Night Emotion Dump', 'created': 1486550468.0}"

But cis female isn't right. I'm not ""girly"". At all. I know it's OK for women not to be girly, and they can still be badass women. Your gender is what YOU say it is. If you are cis female, and prefer to wear strictly men's clothing, you can still be cis female. You can be male bodied and the most masculine man on earth, but if you say you are MtF, you are MtF.

The labels aren't the problem. My appearance isn't the problem. My gender identity is.

I am straight. With only 1 exception, I've always been sexually and romantically attracted to men. The one woman was definitely romantic love, but I didn't really desire anything sexual with her. I know gender identity and sexual orientation are mutually exclusive. Hear me out.

When I was younger, from little on, I felt like a boy. I know it's normal for kids to ""try on"" genders, even if they are cis. But now, I'm pretty glad I didn't transition, because I don't want to have gay relationships with gay men. I want to have straight relationships with straight men. But I'm not feminine enough for most straight men. I wouldn't have any issues dating a transman, but I've just never met one I'm attracted to.

I'm not masculine passing and don't try to be, altho it's never bothered me to be ""misgendered"". But I have very short hair, am a jeans and t-shirts kind of person. Little to no makeup. Most people assume I'm lesbian.

I'm fine just being me. But OTOH, I don't know what that exactly is. Or how to properly express it. I don't feel fully female, but I also know I'm not fully male. Given my choice of gender expression, I would feel more comfortable in a tux than a dress. But I would still want people to know I'm not a man.... I don't think. Is that strange? How is it at 40, I still don't know who and what I am? How can I go about figuring it out?

Discreet from everyone now going in public its very important to have confidence and i know in these types of situations it can be hard but if i saw a big group of ppl waiting to get into the pub i would never shy off or walk around them id walk directly through the middle call it rude whatever i was on a mission and thats how you have to present go for your strolls walking to try to develop your feminine walk but being in heels slot will help you when you dont have them on trust me ive never practised anything voice or walk even makeup took about six months to get down pat and that was doing it from scratch 2 times a day morning and night and im self taught now in regards to the voice this is a big one now most say to practise it religously i think that is absolute crap me personally i have never so much as ever tryed to speak a single work with a feminine voice i think its fake and pathitic ppl use your natural voice who you trying to fool if your a tranny be the real deal everyone says my voice is fine and i use my natural voice in saying that im no sissy im not camp or have a gay feminine voice but i assure you its not an issue and honestly ppl i meet always say you are the real deal well no shit i dont copy whats written fron a book or get guidance from a non Ts therapist i did it my way and im glad i did im at 10.5 months now and alot more passable i dress it down a bit now like ill wear runners and trackies down the street no worries and the reason behind the way i dressed was when i look in the mirror i wanted and saw myself more female presenting i neve did to the androgynous stage also i only self medicated for the first 3 months and tip if you cant wait and have to self medicate i went to the doctors just a normal doctor and said ive been on hormones for 3 months self medicating im anout to run out and it takes 3 weeks for them to be delivered can you please prescribe me them and he said yeah no worries as simple as that i was going through the doctor and told him what i take and how much which is:\nDaily-\n8mg estrofem\n300mg spironolactone \n&amp; \nGirls teenage multi vitamin\nHair skin and nails multi vitamin\n&amp; i believe important for breast devolpment and belice me it works im 10.5 months in and a C cup puraria mirifica\nI leave it there even tho i have plenty more to say any questions/comments i will happily answer this was just a part of my story it is no guide by any means just more a what if i did this or that as im sure some  ppl transitiong would be curious as to if they didnt do what the ""guidelinez"" / "" online"" say \nPeace out \nLove you all!\nBrittany ', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Ppls opinion on voice + transitioning', 'created': 1487553850.0}"

Hi. So..without going into too much detail, I was given the green light to start testosterone last Wednesday, but when I showed up for my appointment, I was informed I would not be getting my prescription because of my congenital heart murmur. 

-I've never been put on any restrictions by my cardiologist.

-I've never passed out etc because of my heart murmur.

-I asked my cardiologist specifically if there would be any conflict with starting hrt and I was given the green light.

When I began going to the doctor at the LGBT center in my area, he asked about my heart murmur. I explained the three points I just listed above. The doctor asked me to sign a release of records form to be faxed over to my cardiologist and for a letter to be faxed over giving me permission to start hrt. I complied and and my cardiologist sent the letter. When I showed up, the doctor sat me down and read the part of the letter that bothered him. Pretty much it said he didn't see anything wrong with me starting T, but he was not aware of any research of patients with heart murmurs starting hrt. In other words, he covered his own ass so he couldn't get sued if  something went wrong. Duh. The doctor had a problem with that because he said that puts all the blame on him if something goes wrong. Now I'm in the middle of this uphill battle where he's getting in contact with my second cardiologist to see if he can get a letter that doesn't absolve the cardiologist of any blame. (Ya. Fat chance. They're not the ones prescribing the T. It's not going to be worded like that.) He has also told me that he will only start me on gel and we'll be going as slow as possible. I understand the reasoning, but I'm not satisfied with that answer. I don't want to go at a snail's pace. I've waited long enough for this and there is no conflict with T and this heart murmur. 

Does anyone else have experience getting T with a congenital heart murmur? What dosage were you started on and did anything tragic happen? I need examples so that if I have to argue my way into a prescription I have some facts to go on. Thanks.

Only to find out after more research that the condition didn't quite fit. 

Recently I've been reading about dissociative disorders and I really feel like that might be what it is that's been wrong with me my whole life. 

Shortly after I graduated high-school (8 years ago) I heard about transgenderism for the first time and it was like an explosion went off in my head. Suddenly almost everything about myself made sense. Since then I've slowly started to explore that part of myself and I'm certain, more certain than about anything else in my life, that I want to transition.

But here's the problem. In order to know for sure if I have a dissociative disorder I'll have to discuss it with my doctor. I've mentioned a couple of times to her that I want to transition but she never asks me about it. I'm worried that if I ask her about dissociative disorders it will invalidate, in her mind, the dysphoria I'm feeling and it will ultimately stall the process of transitioning. What's making me even more worried is that this might turn out just like every other time I've thought I'd figured out what was wrong with me and not only would I be stalling the process but now she'd question everything else I told her because I was wrong about this.

Reddit has helped me a lot in the past (this is a new account, I forgot my old username and password because I didn't visit for a while) and I'm pretty much at a loss for who else to turn to.

I am a 26 year old biological male and have been battling gender dysphoria in various stages of denial for my whole life.  When I was younger, and through highschool transitioning was never a legitimate possibility in my mind but I always knew something was off, especially during puberty.  The changes to my body caught me very off guard and I was particularly sensitive about my height (Ive always been the tallest in my classes and have been about 6'4"" since I was 15).  Much to my chagrin, my height seems to be my defining characteristic and for this and other reasons I wouldn't admit (even to myself) what the cause of my drastic mood swings that eventually led to a brief stint in a mental hospital.  I kept insisting that ""my brain wasn't balanced"" and tried to place my faith in western antipsychotics.  Years of these turned out to not be the solution I was looking for and I weened myself off by the time I was about 21.  


I think it may have been my experimentation with psychedelics that showed me a different framework that was always there but deeply buried and Ive gradually been coming to terms with the fact that I am at least not a male in the traditional sense.  For 5 years I've gone through many periods of buying women's clothing and makeup and trying to explore this other side of myself only to bury it all back in the closet when the realization that a transition just doesn't seem logistically feasible and I would probably end up drawing a lot of negative attention to myself that I am not sure if I would be able to handle (I am very shy and usually like to keep a low profile).


I am scared about what I know about myself now because I feel simultaneously more liberated and more trapped than I have ever felt before.


For fear of a wall of text, Ive only provided a basic outline but would love to elaborate.

My daughter, 15, recently came out to my wife and I as asexual, homo-romantic. She has never (to either of her parents ) questioned her gender, not that it's a thing for us. We love our kid, even though she frequently sees us as 40-something cis/hetero dinosaurs. Maybe we are. 

This weekend, we found that she was given a breast binder from a boy she volunteers with (I think he is transitioning, though I don't know the specifics nor is it my business). My concern with the binder is first, this is out of left field, but if she has questions than so be it. More specifically though, she has a history of back pain issues. According to this article https://janitorqueer.com/2016/06/21/28-risks-of-chest-binding/ there are risks that it could cause significant problems. While I don't want to stop her figuring things out our to invade her privacy, I also don't want her to hurt herself. Should I bring this up, or would it be to invasive and meddlesome?

2017-02-28 03:55:24,5wlr1j,2,15,"It's been less than a week since I realized I'm likely trans, and everything since then has been a hurricane of emotion and denial and reassurance and craziness. Today I decided to go back through all of my old journals, because I'm noticing how much emotional trauma from my past is a direct result of my dysphoria. I found this blog post of mine from 2011 which knocked me on my ass.

&gt;  Had a dream last night that I killed someone. I hung her. Stuffed the body in a black garbage bag and stuffed it into a closet with intention of digging it up and burying it in the desert later. We were at some kind of party, and I had to rejoin the group and act normal.
&gt; 
&gt;  I could barely walk, I was so nervous. It took every ounce of my strength to keep my composure, but I did it and I did it damn well. I thought I was doing great, until someone mentioned they had lost something. They decided to go upstairs and look for it. In the room where I had hidden the body. I sipped my drink and waited. Then she screamed. She had found it. Within minutes, the police were swarming the crime scene. They had sprawled the body out on the bed and were peeling apart the separate elements and separating them into evidence piles.
&gt; 
&gt;  I lost it. I was convinced that they were going to catch me; that they would be able to extract my DNA from the rope around her neck or find my sweat on the garbage. My typically logical and level-headed mind ran rampant with wild ideas and accusations. Nevertheless, I left. I got in my car and drove down the empty road in the middle of the desert, with that heavy and desperately uncomfortable feeling that I was being hunted.
&gt; 
&gt;  I‚Äôve been up for two hours. It still feels like they‚Äôre coming for me.
&gt; 
&gt;  I‚Äôve always felt my dreams were symbolic. So what the hell does that unbelievably disturbing dream mean? Who did I kill, and how could I have possibly MURDERED someone? Why did I hide her in a closet? Why was it so sudden? What did the desert mean?
&gt; 
&gt;  And why, in the waking world, am I still looking over my shoulder and listening for sirens?

My wife and I were almost laughing at how on-the-nose it sounds. I'm literally describing a girl I killed and hid in a closet, the fear of being found out, and choosing the nothingness of the desert over facing the body and consequences I left behind, like choosing to pretend to live as a male in an empty existence rather than embracing the real me.
