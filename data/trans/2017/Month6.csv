Fast forward many years later, I am now 31, married, 6 month old daughter, career working for the government. I have finally settled in, and can now start taking my self into consideration. And thus here we are.

My wife is not trans friendly and believes that it is a mental issue and sees what  Caitlyn Jenner did as incredibly selfish and crazy. Meanwhile I am just nodding in agreement and going along with things so as to not make a big deal out of anything. My wife has known that I crossdress and has basically told me bras are off limits but doesn't care about my bottoms. When I broke the news to her she feared that I wanted SRS and immediately objected to it. I said no it wasn't happening (and unfortunately for me it will never happen just due to being so dedicated to numerous things in my male form)

I love my wife dearly and require my annoying equipment in order to keep her satisfied. However, I have thought about doing HRT to develop breasts and feminize at least a little bit in order to make myself more comfortable.

I feel that I can't cope with myself since long time ago and I'm just 19 soon-to-be 20. Sorry if I sound dramatic. Right now I think I have three ""big"" choices in my life.

1) Keep going like I am without changing nothing, hating myself, wanting to not be me and wishing to never have existed in the first place. But, having the support of my family, ""friends"" and girlfriend.

2) Try to transition, starting with HRT, working to have money for a FFS and so on. This way I will lose my family (they are anti-LGBT+ to the point of cheering when they read they are beating/killed. They hate them deeply), ""friends"" and lose my girlfriend (even though she says we could still be friends). Added to this I could:
* still feel deeply dissatisfied with myself and feel like a monster but now alone and hated not just by me. 
*  Feel good with myself but still lonely and I haven't graduated from college. Where I'm from there's a high index of unemployment for people under 25 (40%) so I fear not getting a proper job and because my family would now hate me, live homeless.


3) an option that comes to my mind more and more, so seducing and could happen now or after taking path 1) or 2).

Every second that ticks without me doing something, it means I'm taking path 1) and the hormones of my body are doing its disgusting effects on me that I just hate (only in me, I have nothing wrong with other people, I don't hate anybody else).

Anyway, when I came out back in August of 2016, I had already rejected my birth name for 10 years.

Well, now I'm starting to wonder if transitioning my name to Nora might not be a good idea.

Hi. So, um, I've always felt like a boy. The feelings are stronger than ever now, so I did some research. So I'm transgender. I think I already knew this, since I heard about the kids who were transgender. Anyway, I want to be a boy. I want to cut my hair short before the dance.

I'll still get stuff from the girl section but not the girly pink frilly stuff. I want to be called E*. I'm to go by he/him instead of she/her. I want to be your son. I am 100% sure. I really hope you support and respect me. Also, I'm bi, so I like boys and girls, but that doesn't have really anything to do with my being trans. I'm still gonna be me. 

*I've omitted his chosen name for privacy reasons. 

We got his hair cut and got him a cool greaser style outfit for the dance which was on Friday. The refusal to wear girly clothes isn't really anything new, for the most part I've let him have a hand in picking out the clothes I buy for him to wear (his mother and I are divorced so I don't know what she buys for him) and he's never really liked dresses. The only time I've made him wear a dress was for weddings and funerals which there have only been 2 of the former recently and thankfully only one of the latter. 

His mother and I have looked into and are signing him up for group sessions with other transgender kids his age (they run a concurrent group for the parents while the kids are in session). Meanwhile his mother and I are both updating our respective families (this is by his request, I think talking to us was the extent of his bravery for now). We also spoke with his teacher to let her know in case anything happens/comes up in the last couple weeks of school. 

So I'm posting now to ask, what else should I be doing?  Those of you who have told your parents/families, what things did they do that were great? Or what things did they do that were not so great and I should avoid?

Hi there. I'm glad I found this subreddit and so happy to see there are many others like me. Many others who are very confused and lost, and I am that without a doubt.

I'm 26 and was born a male. I never had much thought about being male, I mostly maintained a position of neutrality towards my gender and genitalia. Assuming the normal role as a male in society wasn't something I chose but instead it just happened. Did it make me unhappy? No, not necessarily, but I was absolutely sure that it didn't make me happy.

My sexuality has always been mysterious even to myself. I can firmly say I'm attracted to any human regardless of their identity, gender, role, or genitalia. I like both female and male sex organs. As an easy escape from explanation I just say I am bisexual or pansexual depending on the context, and it seems to cover everything....except not.

I have struggled immensely with whether or not I am transgender. On one hand, being a male for the rest of my life seems....acceptable. Doable. Less complicated. On the other hand, I desire very greatly to identify as a girl and live my life as a girl. I feel dysphoric about my body but not my genitals. I don't hate my penis, I just much rather wish it was a vagina.

I have never felt a sense of inner sexiness from presenting as a male....however every time I wear panties I feel like sexiness exudes from me. I have not ever been able to fully dress as a girl, with makeup and wig and the whole nine yards. I do own some clothes mainly for crossdressing under my boy clothes, panties etc. However I think if I was able to make myself up and look somewhat passable, I would feel the happiest and most love for myself I have ever felt.

I felt at least some of these feelings before I ever found the 'sissy fetish', and I have always had a strange attraction to panties from a very young age. However after finding sissy training, porn, hypnos, etc. I began to think this was a more serious part of who I am and not just something that's fun to jerk off to, and I also began noticing issues with myself. I do not like when hypnos or training refers to me as a sissy, and especially not when they refer to me a 'faggot.' When I am in that state of mind, when it's sissy playtime, I am a girl. No doubt about it. I want to be called a girl, treated like one, and presented as one, not at all as a sissy male with a fetish.

Now why am I confused? Sounds like I'm transgender right? Except for whatever reason it's like I'm okay with just being a male. Even though everything screams from within that I want to be a girl, I want to be feminine. It's like there's a voice in my head who says 'that's silly, you're a boy and no one will ever accept you as anything else' and I just listen to it. I have purged two or three times and not always regretted it right away, and seem to have always come back to at least wearing my big girl panties again.

Sigh, I just don't know what to do. And no, I don't have a therapist and have not had the resources to reach out.

...I have been questioning my gender identity for my entire life. (But for the record, I am bio female in their 20s). 


I guess I can start off by kind of giving you an outlook. Okay lets say this; for most trans people....the carpet doesn't match the house...the carpet is pink but the house is blue. With me, the carpet is pink and the house is pink...but its like...two different shades of pink if that makes sense. Or I can even say the carpet is pink and the house is pink with blue all mixed in to make some weird bluish pinkish colour idk how to really explain it. But I can say I was always masculine. I played football with the boys in school and the rules would always be every girl was two-hand touch....except for me. I was tackle. 


My older brother would cross-dress me too. Would call me his ""baby bro"" and see if people would fall for it. Usually they did because I was so young &amp; nothing filled out yet. That or I was always dressed very androgynous when he was around. Thing is, I preferred that. I used to burn the skirts my mother would make me wear. I would cry in church because I had to wear those dresses. Getting older, I stole my Dad and my brothers clothes and wore them but I never hid it. I just went to school or played outside in them...I was always into just girls until 18 when I got into guys and masturbation and all that. So everyone just thought I was a butch...including me. But like I felt happy wearing the clothes. Thats all I can really say. 
To fast forward so this isnt really long, I thought I was ftm in high school. So I started passing and changed my pronouns among friends. It felt right, at first. But I still had moments where I felt like a full on girl. I had moments where I wanted to wear dresses and eyeliner. So I thought I was bigender....and that didn't feel right either after a while.


Now...I don't know. I started getting backlash from family and friends, so I just swallowed it all together and became the cisgendered girl I am today. Now that I am older and have been with both genders, I am sexually attracted to men but not romantically attracted to them...and vice versa with women...with women I was SO BORED but I am SO physically and romantically attracted..But I am a sexual being, and they lack the..plumbing..that I am attracted to. Part of me wonders if it has anything to do with it. 


I guess I am also questioning it so hard right now too because I found out my girlfriend is actually mtf, and being with her just...brings the dude out in me. I mean I stopped with any makeup, stopped shaving the..erm...""areas""...and last week, I experimented again. I put away all of the femme clothes I was making myself wear and bought new ones all from the mens section (even complete with boxer briefs) and I am much more comfortable. I have my days...I wore a dress(ish) to work once...But I wear dress shirts everyday...I told myself I wasn't going to tell her or anyone because of A) the backlash and B ) She goes through real shit being mtf, being on HRT, wanting SRS, and I feel like trying to talk to her about petty feelings when I don't even want to transition would invalidate her. I know its ridiculous. But its true. I feel like she's at 10 and I am at 1 so I am unimportant right now. But I was so happy and comfy I took pictures and she happened to see it. And she told me ""You wear whatever you want."" that was pretty much it. I am not sure if she would even support it, being that she is a lesbian.
Anywhore~ When I look into the mirror...I don't see a guy. I can't imagine a guy like I used to. But one day I was dating a guy who wished I was more ""feminine"" so this girl did my makeup and gave me an outfit...I cried infront of the mirror. I felt ugly and I hated who I was staring at. It wasn't me. And I hated that it is who everyone wants me to be because I know for sure I am not that person. I recently wore another fully male-oriented outfit to work. But instead of boying up completely I wore some small eyeliner with it and didn't try to hide my boobs so much...I loved it. It was perfect. I felt comfortable. I felt right mixing the male appearance with feminine attributes.
So if being a boy in most aspects is right...but I don't feel I am ftm or bigender...But I also don't feel like just a cisgendered girl....I don't know what I'd classify myself as. I guess I am more looking for a community than a label so that I can maybe find someone like me and ask more questions. Maybe even find someone to help me find the courage to come out to my girlfriend (sounds crazy right? Scared to come out to someone who is trans...that you might be trans).

Eventually that led to taking herbal hormones, which was a bad freaking idea because I got really sick, but they did work a tiny bit. I was prescribed hormones for reels last November.

I avoid talking too much as a result, and try to pitch up my voice a *tiny* bit when I do.

2017-06-20 02:07:14,6ib3p1,2,1,"Hello all. I am wondering if I can get some advise and experiences from you regarding the first while after you transitioned. My step brother is 17 and has recently transitioned from female to male and I have no problem supporting them. I had many friends in high school go through the same thing and I was there for them in any way I could be and would like to be for my step brother as well. 

My only problem is they have always been an attention seeker. They were the divorce child and by that I mean the child who was spoiled and given everthing because they were so young when the divorce happened and then in the past 3 years it sort of wore off. People stopped paying as much attention to them and then all of a sudden they decide they are now a he. Still fine to me and his family. 

The problem continues in that he only hang out with trans friends now. Most of which are 3 years younger than him. And the only thing we ever hear about if being trans. Does not matter to who it where it when. The only conversation you can have with him is that he is trans and gay. Even if you just don't respond he keeps going on and on. He will change the topic of conversation to said topic. And heaven forbid you mess up and call him a she or by their original name. You will get a speech about how you don't support him and don't care about him. This also happens to his mother though who has been nothing but supportive. But has a degenerative brain disorder that effects their memory and speech sometimes.

I'm at the point I can't stand to be near them because all they talk about is how they are adding a new colour to this trans flag. And I want to die my hair the colour of the trans flag. And this one person out of 60 people called me a she so I need to get pins to state my prounoun. And on and on and on. It was never like this when my other friends went through it and I'm struggling. 

I guess overall I just want to know how I can support him without wanting to punch him. And also if anyone else was this pushy and how best to handle it. To me I think he does feel more comfortable as a boy. But where does it become raising awareness and just looking for attention.

Participant Recruitment Post

We are a research team from Texas Tech University, UCLA, and Harvard University, and we are conducting a study on minority stress, health, and access to/use of hormones for transition among trans people who are, or want to, use hormones as part of transitioning from female to male. We welcome all individuals to participate who would be included in the “female-to-male” umbrella and who are or are thinking of using hormones (e.g., testosterone) to transition, regardless of specific gender identity and whether or not individuals have or have not begun, or desire to, undertake any aspects of gender transitioning. 

We hope that this study will contribute to the understanding of health and well-being, and access to transitioning hormones, among trans individuals, and will help to promote future work including federally funded initiatives to benefit trans communities. 

Your participation is essential to achieving this goal, so we hope that you will take part in our online survey study. 

In order to participate, you must: 
• Be 18 years of age or older 
• Identify within the “female-to-male” umbrella. We include individuals who were assigned female at birth and are/or are thinking of undergoing transitioning processes. 
• Use, or be thinking of using, hormones are part of transitioning. 
• Reside in the United States

**Background:** My company is owned by a single person who is super duper amazingly supportive, but also a little clueless. He doesn't know any transgendered folks personally nor likely does anyone else in the company (despite living in NYC)

I don't know what folks internal response will be, but I also have 110% support from the owner and I suspect people will be accepting, thrilled, ambivalent, uncomfortable, confused, or any of the above.

**So.... now I get to write an FAQ.** I get direct control of the narrative, wording, and method of execution of how I come out. They've never had a trans employee, nonetheless someone coming out as trans.

&gt; *To me.... this is amazing, and I really don't want to fuck this up.*

I also understand it 'shouldn't' be me to do this, but now I have this amazing opportunity to really affect the lives of my coworker's perception. Most of my coworker likely don't know (or know they know) any trans folks and most view me positively (or at least competent) .... so as a whole I am super optimistic.... and nervous... and relieved..... and happy.... and excited.

**Plan: **

 * Write an FAQ to answer common questions, establish what questions are inappropriate, and establishing norms of treatment. This'll be the basis for the talk between owner and management.
 * Some personal conversations with direct manager &amp; team
 * Owner sends an email (with my own personal note and words) while I work from home. Small groups of people with direct managers to answer any additional questions / become more comfortable.
 * be all at work as me!  :D :) &lt;3
 * Client conversations happen after. (Something I said is not a good precedent), client conversations and internal coming out should be simultaneous.... But first times etc.
None of us have done this before. I'm sure there's a ""set way"", but to me this seems to make sense.

TL:DR I'm the first trans person at my company and I'm coming out soon.  I have support from the owner and I am looking for advice in terms of resources to provide.

Im a 26 yo guy. I have been straight all ny life, but recently ive been feeling curious about experimenting.

I found this gorgeous tgirl on grindr. She is an escort but after chatting for a while she told me to go to her place for free.

I have to be honest, I chickened out and didnt go but today she told ld to go again.

Im not sure, my mind is confused. Im only interested in topping but also Im not sure about being BI. 

Let me explain, I dislike pennis. If I see a cock I lost my arousal and it turns me off completely. Also I have been isolated for a long time and unable to find a girl, and for some reason I feel Im only really horny and lonely and those are the reasons Im just looking for any kind osex I can find.

Also she lives close to my place, so Im pretty concerned about the repercussions of it.

2017-06-25 03:59:49,6jcfac,1,7,"So I don't know how I feel about today.
I tried to figure out which trans subreddit was most ok with a rant, so I hope you lot don't mind. Sorry if you do.

I probably only came out to myself as trans about a year ago. But in college, I experimented with homosexuality and cross dressing. It was fun, and I had a boyfriend who was really into it. My brothers knew. And I never really tried to hide it, but every few years I realize my circle of friends are further and further removed from that part of my life, and I get worried about it coming up. It's like coming out of the closet again and again, only never quite really doing it.

As far as my circle of friends care I'm a cis-hetero male. And,  while I'm juggling complex feelings on the whole subject, I'm pretty ok with it. I work with kids too, and any sign of femininity would cause me loads of problems. So I've been outwardly pretty masculine for quite a while. Like, ten or eleven years since that college fling.


So I'm at a party tonight with some good friends (from later in my college career)  And in walks this guy, who keeps giving me the eye. Later I find he's a good friend of my college boyfriend. He was kind of a prick, but he's ok now, I guess. We talk a bit, and he starts talking about my ex, and how he (the ex) is transitioning now, and then suddenly shifts gears and congratulates me on doing well, and how I grew up and how I'm so manly now.

And I'm sitting here, a few tequila down, thinking ""Last time this guy saw me I was in a sundress with waist length hair practically passing. Most of our interactions involved me snogging his friend, or heading into another room to snog his friends junk. What the hell is this guy thinking.""


So it was just waves crashing over me for a while. Did I want him to stop acknowledging my masculinity? Was I afraid he was going to out me to my current friends, who both know and don't know? Do bi, closeted, or otherwise people who are currently ""Acting straight/cis"" ever get away from this constant feeling of being re-outed and re-explaining yourself to the same people?

And worse.... he said he was going to tell the ex how I was doing... do I even want contact with them? No. But maybe their courage with finally transitioning could help me? Or I could help them? Ugh, god... is it ok to just not care and leave exes as exes?


This isn't really organized. Thank you for reading, or just letting me rant.

Old acquaintance shows up at a party. They knew me when I cross dressed a lot, and told me my ten year past ex boyfriend came out as trans.

Most of our interactions involved me snogging his friend, or heading into another room to snog his friends junk. What the hell is this guy thinking.""\n\n\nSo it was just waves crashing over me for a while. Did I want him to stop acknowledging my masculinity? Was I afraid he was going to out me to my current friends, who both know and don\'t know? Do bi, closeted, or otherwise people who are currently ""Acting straight/cis"" ever get away from this constant feeling of being re-outed and re-explaining yourself to the same people?\n\nAnd worse.... he said he was going to tell the ex how I was doing... do I even want contact with them? No. But maybe their courage with finally transitioning could help me? Or I could help them? Ugh, god... is it ok to just not care and leave exes as exes?\n\n\nThis isn\'t really organized.

2017-06-27 21:44:16,6jw0q9,3,5,"Ever since I was around 13 I've secretly cross-dressed. Off and on I've researched SRS since then. The SRS research was more just a comfort that I'd have options in the future, but I was always terrified of following through - my parents are homophobic and my first partner who I considered a close friend stayed with me for a decade (she didn't know about my feelings), but in retrospect I always envisioned myself in her position during sex or, hell, anything ... which at the time seemed normal?

My parents and ex distracted me to a point where I only rarely thought about being a woman (having a fantastic relationship or fear of hatred is a helluva drug), but the relationships were toxic to me - that's another story. Now that I'm financially independent and single I've started to consider HRT and have read mountains on SRS (especially on Supporn?). I have an appointment regarding HRT next month and am super excited to get the ball rolling!

I did read a discouraging transwoman comment on a blog post that accused fetish driven men who sexualize? being a woman. This confused me because I know that when I cross dress I occasionally get an erection, so now I'm worried I'm just fetish driven! But I remind myself daily that HRT isn't permanent if I decide to back out ... the social aspect, however, is disgustingly terrifying. 

I know I should speak to my therapist about this, but I'm sooo skidish that that even terrifies me ... I'm going to keep my HRT appointment, but I won't lie and say this is easy or I'm not confused or concerned I may destroy relationships or my identity and regret all of this!

The most vain part of it all is I'm terrified I won't be pretty and regret every aspect of this pursuit ...

Send love and advice. I feel delicate right now.

The SRS research was more just a comfort that I'd have options in the future, but I was always terrified of following through - my parents are homophobic and my first partner who I considered a close friend stayed with me for a decade (she didn't know about my feelings), but in retrospect I always envisioned myself in her position during sex or, hell, anything ... which at the time seemed normal?\n\nMy parents and ex distracted me to a point where I only rarely thought about being a woman (having a fantastic relationship or fear of hatred is a helluva drug), but the relationships were toxic to me - that's another story. Now that I'm financially independent and single I've started to consider HRT and have read mountains on SRS (especially on Supporn?). I have an appointment regarding HRT next month and am super excited to get the ball rolling!\n\nI did read a discouraging transwoman comment on a blog post that accused fetish driven men who sexualize? being a woman. This confused me because I know that when I cross dress I occasionally get an erection, so now I'm worried I'm just fetish driven! But I remind myself daily that HRT isn't permanent if I decide to back out ... the social aspect, however, is disgustingly terrifying. \n\nI know I should speak to my therapist about this, but I'm sooo skidish that that even terrifies me ... I'm going to keep my HRT appointment, but I won't lie and say this is easy or I'm not confused or concerned I may destroy relationships or my identity and regret all of this!\n\nThe most vain part of it all is I'm terrified I won't be pretty and regret every aspect of this pursuit ...\n\nSend love and advice. I feel delicate right now.\n\n\nOn the lighter side here are some of my fashion inspirations:\n\nhttp://pin.it/0jAAkTC\n\nI love the ramones and punk in general.

I've been told that I'm the equivalent of a rapist, that my existence is an effort to further lesbian erasure, that trans lesbian isn't a thing, that trans women aren't women and trans men aren't men (obviously, we are), and a bunch of other crap.
