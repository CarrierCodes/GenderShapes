2017-03-01 20:36:25,5wyjsu,12,0,"Hello!
First of all, I want to make clear that this is only my personal opinion, and the way I personally dealt with my own internal struggles. You may think like me, or you may not. Either way, let's respect each other, and if need be, extensively discuss this, alright?

I will say it bluntly: At the end of the day, gender serves no purpose, and should be disregarded. EXCEPT if it helps you cope with your problems, that is.
And even if so, WHAT IS gender exactly? We can argue, read, point out more material to read and educate ourselves. But in the end, it's just a bunch of roles, assigned to one gender or the other. And this disregards the non-binary community as a whole.

So, gender is just the set of socially imposed rules passed on generation to generation. Men have to work and earn money, while women have to raise children, prepare food and clean the house.

Obviously, those roles are being redefined and defied, because they are, well, outdated. So...is gender outdated as well?


All of this comes from me deciding wether or not I'm trans or not. See, I'm a 26 male, whom never had any kind of dysphoria, but always felt inclined towards a more classical 'female' set of roles. I like cooking, I'm great with kids, and so on.
Should my entire gender identity change on a whim just because society keeps telling me that the things I like are ""for girls"" ?
Of course not.

So, I believe, in an ideal world, if we abolish gender roles, we kind of abolish gender as a whole, too. Which is great, since anyone who wants to identify with a gender would be able to, without much fuss. And anyone wishing NOT to identify with any gender would be able to do that as well.

2017-03-01 23:18:46,5wzjk3,15,11,"Ok, story time. I've had a history of having, let's call it, bouts of transness; where I'll get fixated on the subject, and the stories of trans people, and drawing similarities to my own life. I'll analyze all the stories and compare them to my own, and often I'll find a lot in common. Or maybe convince myself that I've found a lot in common. But right when I start to take steps to make some real changes, I'll regress and suppress the event for months or even years like it never happened. I don't know if this is because I didn't have a strong support system and got scared by the kickback from my family compiled with other issues, or, if I am literally just fucking with myself because there is something  wrong with me.
The first time I did this, I was around eighteen or so. A guy had come out in my very queer friend group, and there were some other people coming out about being trans. All of that really made me question myself, like a whole lot; and at the time, it added up that I was trans too. So I came out as nonbinary, and later ftm. At the time, I didn't receive the same support or acceptance as these other people did; long story short, they didn't really take me seriously. I wasn't, at the time, a stereotypical masculine person. I had a lot of anxiety and depression. That and other teenage, college drama added up and I eventually left the friend group, and started to dress more androgynous and trying to present female. I still lived with my parents, and masculine presentation upset them. That and people were fucking terrible because it was the goddamn sticks.

Flash forward a few years, I pretty much did the same thing again. Came out as trans at a school, started living as a guy, and then my parents flipped out and I realized I needed to be able to support myself without parents doing random pirouettes off fucking handles. So I enlisted in the military like a fucking genius, and here we are a few years later thinking about the same bullshit again. 
I'm sorry if this is kind of convoluted, I'll wrap it up. Right now I'm presenting as a female at work, not like I have much of a choice. Most of the time, I don't feel like I'm even human; pretty disassociated, angry and depressed 90% of the time. But I don't know if that's due to the environment, which basically fucks up everyone equally, or, if it's because of the environment and repressed trans crap. I'll go months or years without thinking about this stuff, just riding my little bicycle along, and then it's like I try to put a stick between the spokes and knock my ass over. So I guess I'm wondering if any of you have ever met a cisgender person who was just such a mess about stuff that they convinced themselves they were trans?

So I'm 26, been on hrt nearly 2 years now(mtf) and really getting towards the end of my rope.
I went through a period of severe depression with a lot of alcoholism before I started with transitioning. For the most part the depression has never gone away but it has definitely changed. Drinking not an issue now.
I was initially studying electrical engineering right out of high school but after a few years of failing and repeating over and over again I stopped. It was around this point I accepted that I was trans and began working towards hrt. 
Last year I had my name officially changed and went full time. (Great! ) 
I began studying to become a nurse at the start of last year. Its great and I really enjoy it but I had a slight bump with depression and ended up failing a bunch of classes 2nd semester. Since then the depression has gotten worse again and I have been suicidal on and off for months. 
I've been on effexor for over 2 years. 
I have been unable to bring myself to even apply for any jobs(i live off centrelink( government support)) for more then a year. I am repeating some classes this semester but its already looking like I'm failing again. 
I cant see how I will ever be able to afford to get srs and that really gets to me as I get serious dysphoria about it. Anxiety can be a huge problem when im out as well.

So I have no motivation or drive to do anything past the bare minimum needed to live, I've started on the downward spiral that is failing at uni again, I cant manage to loose weight and srs is probably years away. 
I have been cutting myself starting from a few weeks ago ( its helps at the time), been very suicidal at times but haven't quite been able to get to it (yet...)

Yes I have tried talking to friends about this, while they might want to help me they understandably feel way out of their depth. I am going to talk to another counselor today at uni. 
I haven't been able to tell my gp about any of the suicidal thoughts or cutting (same with my regular therapist)

I shrugged it off as a rather hollow invitation at the time (i'm not sure why) but still said yes, a long with lots of other people.

Last night it became a reality, and just like he'd told me stories of previous year's get togethers, lots of people backed out when push came to shove. From my perspective it was just going to be him, a mutual friend i met through him (guy #2), and myself going. Both of them know i'm trans, and both of them are super accepting and supportive, so I absolutely went for it.

Shortly after I found out that another guy, someone I don't know and have never spoken too before is going also (guy #3), that's fine, no biggie i'm sure he's great.

Guy #3 is talking to guy #2 (in dms) and asking questions about me, he asks what my name is, now guy #2 is so freaking precious  he panics and asks guy #1 (who i'm closer with) to ask me instead, because and I quote:

&gt;i feel weird asking cause it feels like im dropping an ultimatum like im in any place to be doing that

I had been planning to hopefully go as myself the whole time I was there with them, and this extra guy shouldn't impact that plan really, so I just said to tell him my real name (not deadname) and if worst comes to worst it's a gender neutral name anyway, even though the last thing I want associated with me and that name is boymode, but, hey, whatever.

So after all the details are settled and bookings are made and stuff I go to bed with a big smile on my face, I don't really sleep that much and spend the whole night in my head planning outfits. (Lol)

Come morning my cat wakes me up for some breakfast, normally she wakes my mum up, but i guess i was restless enough to get all the attention this morning. After i'm properly awake and about to get up she climbs onto my bed and curls up next to me (something she literally never does, she's developed an aversion to cuddles for some reason) now i'm quietly squeeing into my pillow that the cat is curled up next to me.

When she finally get's sick of lying next to me (after a good 5 minutes, go kitty!) we get out of bed and I pull on some dirty shorts from h&amp;m that i wore yesterday. Normally I wear my shorts around my hips in boymode and not around my waist, but this morning i just pulled them up to my waist without even thinking.

As I turn around to head out the door I stop dead and stare at the mirror, my room was still heaps dark so I was mostly just a silhouette in the mirror but since when have i had a narrow waist?! my shoulders are still way wider than my hips are, but with this new found narrow waist my body almost has some shape.

In the low light i couldn't make out any of my stupid body hair, and my bed-head was hanging loosely down in front of my shoulders, holy shit i actually liked what i saw in the mirror for the first time in... ever?

I head into the bathroom (more light) and put my hair up in a high ponytail, again, something i never normally do, and go feed the cat / make coffee.

I'm sitting here cross legged on the couch with my cat next to me, a big shit eating grin on my face, and tears in my eyes. Actually, genuinely happy. Best day of my life?

Second, I'm truly sorry if I accidentally say something offensive.  I'm a cis man and don't have a lot of experience with the trans community, other than a superficial understanding and support.

I received a Facebook friend request a couple weeks ago from someone I didn't recognize, but we had some mutual friends so I decided to approve.  I noticed (and here's something that might be offensive) that they were a trans woman, but didn't really think anything of it.

A few days later, I saw the popular post that was going around about the scientist who used evidence to refute someone saying that gender was a simple black and white issue and I shared it.

I guess my question is, what do I say?  I want to reach out to her, because she's undergone a huge life change.  I have a lot of questions for her, about her transition, about her marriage, about her family, but I don't want to bombard her.

Right now, I consider myself gender fluid.
I recently cut my hair and I love it. I definitely feel more connected to my guy side. 

 Lately I've been watching a few ftm YouTube channels, and have been thinking about what it would be like to be on hormones. 

For a little background, in 2008 I went to a school that had therapy combined. And for a while while I was there, I would dress in guys clothes, and I even had my friends there call me by a different name. 

I tried telling my mom how I felt, and she told me that it was just a phase. That people who are trans show signs of it when they're little, and I never did. 

So I hid how I felt, until I moved out. And within the last could years I came out as gender fluid, after coming out as pansexual. 
 
Lately I've been feeling way more guyish then usual. And like I said I've been thinking on what it would be like to be on T. Could I be trans? 
  
   I'm scared. If I am trans, it would cause a lot of.. Issues. I'm currently living with my fiance (a straight, cis male). He knows that I'm gender fluid but we don't talk about it much.

For myself, I had breast tissue forming within 3 weeks. I had A cup breasts between months 2 and 3. I've had B cup breasts since the start of my 5th month, and I will be on hormones for 6 full months on April 12th.

My thighs had filled out a lot during the first 2 months, my ass started filling out at the start of my 2nd month, and my hips became obvious at the beginning of my 5th month.

My face started softening right away, and around month 3 or 4 is when there was a major difference.

My shoulders started softening within the first 2 months, but there wasn't a major change until months 3 or 4.

Throughout this whole experience my nipples have itched  (since week 2), and I've felt aches in my calves, arms, and shoulders from the change on my muscle mass.

As a side note, I have hazel eyes (light brown/green). Since starting hormones, the green in my eyes started slowly pulling to the forefront, so that now it's a toss up on whether they are ""more golden brown"" or more green, or somewhere oddly inbetween.

Edit: I want to point out that, even though my voice has changed dramatically, it's not as a result of hormones. Estrogen will not reverse the effects of testosterone on the vocal chords. But over the past 7 or 8 months I've been undergoing intense vocal training, not professional. 

Because I work in retail, in Texas, it's extremely important for me to pass vocally, and it's always been a big source of my dysphoria.

2017-03-24 23:48:12,61ckjq,9,19,"Hi r/trans! 
I'm not super familiar with this subreddit, so if I fuck up something, by all means call me out. 

I am looking for some guidance to be sure I'm not being a shit ally as I try to be a good ally. 

Can you all help me? 

I am a cis(ish)-woman, and I've become peripherally (though I'm being drawn in more and more) involved with a group of activist women in my town. I was added to a secret group on Facebook and I've started to contribute to the group somewhat. 

Recently someone posted in the group and addressed everyone thus: 

""Hey clits! [rest of post]"" 

In response, I started a thread which asked people not to use body-part words to conflate womanhood, as that is exclusionary to some trans women (bear in mind I don't know the make-up of the group as far as if any trans-women/gnc/non-binary peeps are present, though I did wait a few hours to see if anybody else would raise this issue and nobody did). 

The post asked respectfully if people could take some time to think through why we would use body-part names as stand-ins/shorthand for 'women' and to reflect on how that might be exclusionary to some people who do not have those body parts but who nevertheless ARE women. 

The thread was pretty badly derailed into loads of people being annoyed that they apparently are no longer allowed to celebrate or talk about their body parts or experiences related to those body parts. Though I reiterated a bunch of times that that was not my point, people persisted in mis-reading my post and making it all about how they were apparently being silenced. There was a lot of 'us vs them' going on as well, which was sad. 

Ok, so that's the background. 

For me, I want to be a good ally. I believe strongly that its not up to trans (or other oppressed groups) to always instigate discussions to drive progressive change, and that its up to me to use my privilege to help create safer spaces, whether or not people from that oppressed group are present (yet) or not. (Maybe they're not present because the space hasn't been made safe enough for them - ?) 

However, I do NOT want to fall into the trap of being a cis-white knight and creating drama and messiness which could end up making spaces less safe for trans people. I also do not want to speak for trans people or over them, but l also do not want to force people to out themselves in order to speak with authority and be heard (not that that always works anyway). 

Please tell me how I can navigate this space to push towards a better result, without silencing or talking over trans voices, but without requiring outing, or tokenising trans people. I'm really stuck and I need to know if I am on the right track or if I'm way off base here. 

I struggle with ally-ship in this way across a range of issues and maybe there isn't a clear or ready or easy answer, but I am not prepared to move forward without input and guidance from groups to which I consider myself an ally being able to feedback into my actions.

It's like, I'm reasonably sure that I'm genderfluid (in addition to bisexual), because I can't help but imagine what I'd be like as a woman.

I think she talked to my father about it and since then they started to ""train"" me as a boy, but I only realized that recently. So, any feminine behaviour was repressed, not severely, they just really taught me how to be a boy in a loving way, and I'm pretty sure they always thought this was the best for me.

After I left this school, I decided to let my hair grow (I’m a musician so that’s normal), and in my teenage years people would often mistake me for a girl and, even though I denied it, I really loved it.

I grew my hair out a little longer once high school ended past my shoulders and suddenly the misgendering stopped. They all called me 'she' 'maam' 'girl.' This should've been a relief right? No more awkwardness in front of my classmates or anything uncomfortable. But that's not what happened.

I missed it. I still miss it. When people say, ""here's your change, ma'am,"" I just think, ""what's changed? Have I really changed that much? I feel the same."" I'm just a little upset and disappointed whenever people call me by my right gender and I shouldn't be. I love being female and having female pronouns but I like when people called me a boy or 'he' and I'm disappointed and mildly upset when they don't. I almost want to cut my hair and just see if it they misgender me again. 

I told my friend about it and she said I should probably do some soul searching. So I don't know what's going on. Can you all help me soul search? What's your opinion?
