Actually, he didn't just refuse, but he gave his reasons for it!  I apparently don't act like the gender I came out as, so he's not going to refer to me as a man.  He listed off all the reasons that he doesn't consider me that gender, and he said worse to my dad about it.  This was two or so years ago, and I've avoided him until this year.  I've seen him three times at family events.

At the first one, I ignored him by staying in a different room until he left.  He probably didn't know I was there.  At the second, I just avoided being in a room with him prolonged, and we didn't speak.  At the third, I didn't speak to him, but stayed where I wanted and conversed with other family whether he was there or not.  It wasn't to snub him, but I have 0 will to even be polite to him.  At the end of the gathering, he approached me and tried to say goodbye and give me a hug.

I said, ""No, don't, I'm serious"" and he kept trying to hug me.  I raised my voice (out of panic basically) and said ""Don't touch me!"" and he left, embarrassed.  He's been ranting and whining about how he doesn't discriminate, how he accepts his family, etc, since then a *week ago*.  Like jesus christ, he completely disrespected me, deadnamed and misgendered me because of his idea of what gender is, and he's this offended by the fact that I won't hug someone that treats people like that?

Ugh.  Sorry for the rant, I'm really worked up right now!  I guess this post is to ask, am I wrong about this?  I didn't make anyone else uncomfortable, I had talked to everyone before I went to make sure they were okay with my presence and the conflict that could occur if he tried to pretend nothing was wrong.  If it would be awkward or uncomfortable, I wouldn't have gone.  But am I wrong for not being affectionate and friendly with him?

 We created this server because we wanted to make a server that we hope will be as inclusive as it possibly can, when if any problems arise, they will be dealt with swiftly and head-on. 

What motivated us to make another trans server amongst the many existing ones is that we have seen unjust treatment in some other trans servers and we hope to make a space that will be unbiased and competent. Anyone will be welcome here regardless of age, gender identity and progress of transition. We have about 24 members of all identities. 

We have many channels (such as Gaming, Music, Anime, and Beauty) as well as seperate channels for Non-Binary, MtF, and FtM to talk in. We also have a detailed role system that is outlined in the rules and info channel when you join the server. 

This server has channels for serious topics but overall we want to promote a relaxed and friendly environment.
