I'd let a friend of mine know before, but he was already out as a transmale and so I figured he'd know where I'm coming from. Family is different.

Like, my dad means well, but sometimes I feel like he's crushing me when what he's really trying to do is protect me from being ""too odd."" If I came out as genderfluid to him, I'm sure he'd just get behind me and support me, but at the same time, I know that it's hard for him. So there's that.

So last night I told my brother Matt how I feel, and tried to keep it on the DL from my sister Selene, whose bar we were at. After explaining how I felt and what being Genderfluid meant to me, he was like ""I love you. You're my sibling. I might not agree with everything you say, and I might forget to call you ""they,"" but I love you"" and so I told my sister Selene and she was cool with it as well!

I don't know why this was so hard. It shouldn't be hard. People I know are fond of me and shouldn't react bad. I don't know why this is so hard to do. I haven't told my sister Martha, but I think she knows, at some level, and doesn't want to bring it up until I'm ready to bring it up. Which I think I will do sooner than later.

I just want people to know. I feel like letting a whole load of people know and them just supporting me because that's what you do is not what I want.

I don't want attention. I don't want an embarrassing out-pour of support that will dominate my every conversation with for the next few weeks. I just want them to know. But letting them know means they'll feel like speaking up. Or saying ""I knew it"" and things like that, which is worse because *I* didn't know it until a week ago, and even then it's only because this subreddit supported me in ways I didn't know I needed supporting.

I have come to you because I feel like I don't know where else to turn.

2017-04-07 08:00:38,63z2py,3,8,"So recently I've come to the acceptance that I'm MtF Transgender after a long period of feeling unmotivated and generally very ""off"" and unhealthy mentally and not knowing why. I thought figuring out it was dysphoria would make it easier, but instead I've gotten worse knowing I can't try to ""fix"" it. I've come out to some of my closer friends already and so far no one's reacted negatively, so that's good at least. I desperately want to start transitioning or at least start presenting female or see a therapist or something, but my home situation really prevents any of this. My parents are part of a cult (Jehovah's Witnesses) and because I was born into it I'm stuck in it too, and they have a really negative view of anything regarding the LGBT community (my dad unironically compared gay people to terrorists once). I'm not even allowed to go out with friends at all or even see people not in the cult outside of school because they're afraid it'll make me worship Satan or something. I'm still in high school and don't have a job and my parents would definitely kick me out of the house if they found out I was trans. It's gotten extremely hard to get out of bed in the morning, my grades have taken a serious hit, all I want to do all day is sleep, I've been avoiding talking to people more, and I'm feeling more suicidal then I ever have before (Haven't and don't plan on trying to kill myself though). I'm really at my wit's end with this and I don't want to fall any deeper into the emotional pit I'm in, any advice on what I should do would be appreciated.

I thought figuring out it was dysphoria would make it easier, but instead I\'ve gotten worse knowing I can\'t try to ""fix"" it. I\'ve come out to some of my closer friends already and so far no one\'s reacted negatively, so that\'s good at least. I desperately want to start transitioning or at least start presenting female or see a therapist or something, but my home situation really prevents any of this. My parents are part of a cult (Jehovah\'s Witnesses) and because I was born into it I\'m stuck in it too, and they have a really negative view of anything regarding the LGBT community (my dad unironically compared gay people to terrorists once). I\'m not even allowed to go out with friends at all or even see people not in the cult outside of school because they\'re afraid it\'ll make me worship Satan or something. I\'m still in high school and don\'t have a job and my parents would definitely kick me out of the house if they found out I was trans.

By 10 I was up set and really hating the idea of puberty and than it started. About 14 I heard of Chaz Bono I said ""he\'s really cool I love him"" with a big smile than my mom said ""well if you want to be a lesbian go ahead"" I was shocked because he clearly was a man so I asked her why did she say that that was a boy not a girl. Than she explained it to me so later I look up and ended up reading about being transgender and learning about other trans people. 17 I felt I had to come out before I offed myself over the 3 years I heard to much shit about trans people so I came out I got my ass beat soon as I told them. I was staying with my friend than a week later my brother called and said he had a place for us to stay that he had it all covered. Now 3 years later I\'m in my room 1:30 in the morning while my only REAL family member is down the hall asleep. I still love my parents but I don\'t care to hear from them all the family I need is down the hall.

This will be the 3rd floor of a mixed-use building. It will be a dance rehearsal studio and office. Total square footage is about 2800. I expect capacity to be just under 50.

What we want to do is build one genderless single-user ADA bathroom and another genderless single-user non-ADA bathroom. 

The Florida plumbing code says that whenever facilities are required, separate facilities are required for males and females. However, ultimately it's up to the coding official.

What sort of arguments are likely to hold the most sway? Can we say we're doing this to be friendly to the trans* community even if no one in our company is trans? Or would we be better off making some more mundane appeal to the occupancy number or the use classification?

If you haven't dealt with this issue, feel free to comment, but I'm specifically looking for the input from someone who has already gone through this with a city coding official.
