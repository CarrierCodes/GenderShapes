2017-12-01 07:18:18,7gth39,19,41,"I've been trying to think of a good first post in here, and didn't wanna do the classic ""hi"" post (not that there is anything wrong with those, just not my speed).  So, after a bit of thought, figured I'd just say what I've been going through the past few weeks, what lead up to it, and thoughts on the future.  I know this sub, like all trans-centric subs, gets a lot of curious lurkers, and maybe my story might help someone.

First, the basics.  I'm a 34yo AMAB.  I'm married to one of the best women on earth.  I work an entry level corporate job, and live with three room mates I consider good friends.

I have been some flavor of depressed all my life.  No suicidal ideation or self destructive tendencies (thank chickens, I don't know if I'd been strong enough to resist those), but just this constant feeling of, well, not right.  It was like I didn't belong, like I was always on the outside, and I certainly felt unworthy.  I hated myself.

I always, however, just chalked up the self loathing to poor life choices.  Didn't finish high school, didn't go to college, bad first marriage, bad with money, lazy, out of shape; all of these were what I believed was the source of all of it.  And this had gone on for a *long* time.

About two years ago, a good friend of mine publicly came out as trans.  I really value my friends; they are the family I choose.  So, I started learning about being trans, what it entails, the difficulties trans folk face, and so on.  I wanted to be there for them, so I had to know about all of this.

Interestingly, within a short time after that, a couple more of my friends also came out as trans, and I met some other trans friends through them.  I figured that, well, I've always known interesting people, I'm a geek and a gamer, isn't too odd that I know a bunch of trans folk.  That, and I'd been learning about what it is to be transgender, supporting my friends, so maybe I was just comfortable.

Now, some way, way back-story here, before we go on.  I've always liked feminine clothing.  I didn't tell too many people about this, but it has always been the case.  I was the early teen who tried on his mother's clothes when no one was home.  And in my late teens, I went through a ""cross dressing"" phase.  I was lucky enough to have some very open minded and caring friends, and I often went days presenting female at their place.

I knew one person trans at that point.  They were FtM, and they stayed with one of my friends for a time.  Being young, though, I just assumed they were a masculine lesbian, and didn't dig any further.

Eventually, I drifted away from those friends, and away from feminine clothing.  It didn't occur to me how comfortable I felt in them, and I pushed away the memories of wishing I could just live like that.

Now, add over a decade of time passed, a couple of failed serious relationships, and a ""meh"" series of jobs that generally have paid the bills well enough (not really). Toss in 80 or 90 pounds gained. Along with that, put a successful marriage I do not deserve, and am eternally grateful for.

I had recently, about six months ago, started dieting to lose weight, and have had some success.  I was feeling better about my self image, enough to try shaving my face, something I hadn't done in years.

A good friend and my wife were both curious about me cross dressing again.  They thought it would be fun.  My wife is a cosmetologist, wanted to maybe do my hair and make-up.  I wasn't feeling as fat as I have, so I agreed.

Well, I did, and got a look at myself, and things suddenly felt different.  Really different.  Better.  I felt good.  But the clothes weren't the only thing that changed.  My personality felt more open, I felt less weighed down, just, I felt...

...happy.  I felt happy.  I'd forgotten what it was like.

So, I realized I needed to talk to people.

I reached out to my trans friends.  I talked with them about my feelings, and they gently encouraged me to explore them.  Never anything heavy handed, never what they thought or didn't think I ""was"". Lots of questions and listening, lots of careful guidance towards introspection.

I first thought I was genderqueer.  Like, it has to be in the middle, right?  I'm a little of A, a little of B, somewhere around there.  And I did talk some with the lovely people in r/genderqueer, though I more read their posts, heard what they had to say.  They helped me a lot.

But it wasn't quite right.  I wasn't in the middle, or even a little to one side.  

My room mates were all understanding, and I began presenting feminine at home.  It quickly became an all the time thing when I wasn't out and about.  Unless someone was over who didn't know, I was lounging about in shorts and a camisole, doing chores in a sweater dress, whatever.   I stopped wearing briefs, started wearing panties all the time.  I got a bra.  I really like my bra.

I picked up a skin care routine, because I realized I really like to be pretty.  And there wasn't self loathing involved.  It wasn't ""you look like shit, fix it"".  It was ""I like being pretty and delicate, how can I get there more?"".  I started having an easier time working out, and my diet wasn't as much of a chore.

I had discovered motivation again.  I was experiencing ambition.  I have struggled with ambition for over a decade.

This pushed me to more talks with my friends, more thoughts, more discussion...

It was interesting where the revelation came from.  I had messaged one of my trans friends, and asked her ""Do you know any exercises that target and tone the pectorals, but don't work the arms very hard?"". 

Yeah, I know, that should been a revelation moment.  But it wasn't yet. It did, however, allow her to answer in the most witty way possible, which was to send a picture of the chemical composition of estrogen.

I loved the humor in it.  I'm a nerd, it was a science joke, it was great.  I showed my wife, she... didn't laugh.

She was suddenly concerned with what would happen if I decided to go on hormones.

So, we had a talk.  I told her I wasn't considering that at all, but hypothetically, we could absolutely look through what that would entail.  So I read up with her, looked into the physiological changes estrogen would cause.  I told her the truth, that no matter who I am, or realize I am, I still love her, and always will.  And that helped her, and she was better, and supportive.

And now, I had hormone therapy on the brain.  And how difficult it would be to get, *hypothetically*.  And how much it would cost, *hypothetically*.  And how long changes take, *hypothetically*.

And I watched videos, and I realized that my self loathing, and my lack of ambition, and my feelings of isolation and being on the outside, could all be marked up to gender dysphoria.

And I talked with my friends more.  And I asked myself more questions.  And I finally came to a conclusion.

And I contacted a lot of my friends, trans and not, and told them my revelation: I am a woman.  I am a trans woman.

And a lot asked if I was sure.

And I told them yes.

And a lot of them then said something to the effect of, ""Fucking hell, took you long enough to figure it out, we've known for months/years.  Congratulations, love.""

O_O

Apparently, I was one of the few surprised.

So, here I am.  I'm still not publicly out, but I know who and what I am, and it helps SO much.  It's like a limiter had been taken off my brain.  I'm happy. I'm actually fucking happy.

And I'm terrified.  There is so much ahead of me.  There are so many people in the world that already hate me, and they've never even met me.

But I am also amazingly lucky.  I have friends who are ridiculously supportive, and a wife who is not only overjoyed to see me happy again, but honestly gets a kick out of buying me clothes and shopping with me.

As of where I'm going, I'm doing what a few friends recommended, which is slowly edging towards public presentation.  I'm ""feminizing"" my masculine styles, slowly switching out of my old ""potato sack"" clothes, working my way I to the feminine side of androgynous for now.

I figure early next year, maybe February, I'll look into the medical side of things.  Talk to a doctor and a therapist.  Look into HRT.

Because, well, I'm a woman.  Always have been.  Just took me way too long to find myself.

Anywho, if you've read through all this, thank you.  If you're lurking in here, unsure of who or where you are right now, I hope it helped.  And if anyone has advice, omg, FEEL FREE to stick it in the comments.  I'm game for any tidbits of knowledge, and I'm sure others reading this would love it too.

As the title suggest, I'm gender confused, and while nobodies opinion on here replaces professional help, I'm kind of in a position where professional help isn't affordable, so it would be nice to hear some opinions on my situation.

When I was a kid, for as long as I can remember I wanted to be a a girl. There were three girls my age that lived on my street when I was a kid, and they were my friends growing up. I played with dolls with them and did other girly things. I remember one point one of the girl's mothers got married, so we got to go to a wedding. I was honestly super jealous that the girls got to wear dresses and I couldn't wear one. When I would be home laying in bed by myself, I often wished there would be a magic pill I could take that would turn me into a woman. I was got obsessed with it to the point I went as far as to stealing my moms clothes to wear them and pretend I'm a woman.

However around when I became a teen things changed a lot. The first thing that happened when I was in about 6th grade, my dad caught me dressed up in my mom's clothes. He was really disappointed and let me know about it. I felt so ashamed after that. So I stopped doing that, I tried to be a guy after that, I don't wanna be a disappoint to my parents. On the surface, I seemed like a normal cis guy, but I still felt the want to be a woman. But when I get to middle school my cast of friends change completely.

I seem like a normal cis male on the outside. I must be a guy that was just confused as a kid is all right? Well I now kind of alternate between two clashing ideas.

The first one is that I'm definitely a guy that was confused as a kid, and the only reason I have these thoughts now is because I can't get a girlfriend. I know the girlfriend thing sounds stupid, but I'm honestly obsessed with the idea of getting one. Sometimes I feel like if I could get a girlfriend, it would end all thought of being transgender.

The other idea that goes in my head, is that I'm clearly a woman in a man's body that is just in flat out denial because of societal pressure. I think a lot about ""what if I could magically turn into a woman?"" I oftentimes conclude I would be a lot happier if I could. 
I don't do girly things like I did as a kid, but I own a set of woman's clothes and will wear them in my room by myself where I can't be seen. Don't do it as often as I could, but I do it.

2017-12-03 12:41:25,7h9g6h,11,10,"Before I get started, I'll fully admit this post is a lot of me venting.  If you have advice, awesome, but really, I just need to say this to a bunch of people who get it.

I've understood that I am trans for about a month now.  And, like with many of you, the realization and truth was freeing and uplifting.

However, now I'm seeming to have a little trouble embracing my feminine, erm, ""persona""?  Though it might be better to say that I'm having trouble discarding or distancing myself from my false ""male"" persona.

My previous coping mechanism for dealing with my misunderstood dysphoria was to simply embrace my flaws as my me.  My depression, my self loathing, my over-analytical, neurotic nature, I embraced and protected.  Even as it was damaging me, I held on tighter, under this tragically romantic fallacy that if I internalized it hard enough, I'd, I dunno, work?  Yeah, I know, i was doomed, but i didn't realize yet.

So, now I'm at this weird in-between, stuck in the middle of embracing my female identity, but still ""untangling"" myself from the man I thought I was.  

I mess up on my own pronouns in my head, and I call myself my old name.  And it isn't comforting.  I described it to my wife as, like in a show or movie, how they will sometimes visually represent depression or sadness by showing the colors dim and drain around a person, like a blue-tone filter applied to everything.  That's how it feels when I misgender myself, or think about crawling back inside my old male clothes, and hiding again.  But it's familiar, and usual.

One the other side, when I'm gendered correctly, by myself or others, or when I'm in confirming clothing, or call myself my name, it's bright and vibrant, and happy.  But it's also new, and unfamiliar.

And because of this, part of me wants to rush my transition as much as possible, to force everything into the world regardless of consequence.  However, this would not work yet.  I live in a conservative part of town, and I have a job I cannot, simply cannot, present while attending to.  Also, I'm still working towards getting my body where I want it, and embracing my own features in a feminine sense.  The last thing I want to do is push too hard, get the ""man in a dress"" kind of dysphoria, and scare myself into hiding again.  Depression is horrible and painful, but it is familiar, and familiarity has a weird, fucked up appeal.

So, i'm here.  I'm working on getting more feminine ""masculine"" clothes, such as women's jeans and shoes, more colorful shirts, things that still kinda pass for ""guy"", but let me feel like I'm being the girl I am.  I'm trying to call myself a woman, use my name.  I'm trying to see the girl that is there.  And I see it, sometimes.  I just wish I could get there faster.

Anyways, thanks for reading.  Posting things like this helps.  And feel free to leave similar experiences in the comments (or anything at all in the comments, really.  I'm happy to listen).

  I often use the labels ""demigirl"" or more generally ""transfeminine"", because I dont always feel able to call myself simply a girl. ""Girl"" sounds right sometimes, but ""trans girl"" doesnt. Its a weird combination of labels that seems to work for me...

I have strong dysphoria about being male, and one thing that triggers it is when I actually FEEL male. I often have to make an effort to see myself as female, rather than androgynous (what im wearing and how I look affect this quite a lot). So, being as how ""feeling female"" equals ""feeling human/happy/non-dysphoric"", is it worth trying to ""force it"" a bit more?

To be honest, I cant even tell if ""forcing"" is the right word, or if im still simply having to make an effort to ""allow"" myself to see myself as a girl, and to feel like one.

I have been able to see myself as female more often since social transition, but its just not enough, and things (usually libido related) keep dragging me back.

I've been identifying as MTF for over 8 years now, and now that I'm in college, I've been more open about my identity to fellow students. Since I not yet have started HRT, I've been using the handicap (unisex) bathrooms. I have days where I pass better as female (basically, when I shave my face and pay attention to hygiene -- you know, like a functioning human being) and I just today started using the women's room. Granted, it was empty both times, but when and how do you decide that it's time to start using the women's room?

Since I haven't started hormones yet, I've also really been struggling with dysphoria. Starting hormones is a big deal for me, but it's hard to do with my current living/financial situation. It'd make sense that dysphoria should motivate me, but it's just another thing dragging me down.

2017-12-07 19:43:36,7i92hl,8,22,"Hello ladies, fellers, and enbys! Just wanted to talk about somethin for a little bit. I just made a new account after using my old one with my deadname on it for five years and wanted to make a first post with it.

My name is Dahlia, and I'm a trans woman of 21. I've been officially out for almost two and a half years, and I've only been on HRT for two months. I'm not good at makeup, my executive dysfunction makes it hard to get out of bed and brush my teeth, never mind shaving. I don't usually wear what most people would consider ""feminine"" clothing, being that it's not my personal style and it's getting cold here in Denver, CO.

I'm pretty involved in the underground music scene in Denver; I play in two bands, [Flower Crown Me A Queen](https://flowercrownmeaqueen.bandcamp.com) and [Ludlow](https://ludlowmassacre.bandcamp.com), the latter of which has all trans members. I'm generally well known here as far as underground shows go, which are populated by folks like me: Gender-nonconforming, a rejection of the binary, disdain for authority and rules, and a presentation to match. I've got a beard, I dress in alternative fashion and I don't act explicitly feminine, because that's not who I am. I'm a firey, runaway cart that doesn't care if there are roadblocks in my path. I'm getting to where I'm trying to go.

I'm just having trouble reconciling these spaces where I am welcomed and appreciated and respected, not in spite of my being transgender, but very much because of it, and how I still get misgendered at work by customers, and by strangers on the street and in my neighborhood. I know that it's because of my unwillingness to pass, partly because I know I can't yet (so why bother?) and also because I shouldn't need to pass in order to be respected. I shouldn't need to bend over backwards for people who couldn't give less of a fuck if I fit into the boxes they try to stuff me into. They won't be satisfied until they can't tell the difference between a trans person and a cis person, and even then there's still laws being made about us and a murder rate that's phenomenally fucked up.

I don't wanna hide. [I don't want to have to force myself back into the closet if I can help it](https://sheherhers.bandcamp.com), and I want to make a world where people don't have to do that in order to be respected. I just want to be treated like a person, no strings attached, no fine print.

It was a lot easier when I was younger and there were less immediate consequences. Being a transgender adult in the US right now is a lot fucking harder than it should be, and I'm just mad about it. I needed to talk about it. It should be addressed and I don't know what avenues people would be willing to listen to. I'm frustrated, and tired.

Okay, so as a trans person, you get to wear women's clothes when it suits you, but grow a beard and wear men's clothes when it will benefit your career? You don't buy me a drink when we go out on our first date, but you get to suggest sex repeatedly throughout the night (when I say I just want to take things slow and connect emotionally), basically, just be an entitled man to the NTH degree. Bragging about your blossoming business and all the connections you have through your family and 'mentors.' I can't take it. I'm like, okay, so you just want to be a trans person because you want to escape the societal expectations of being a 'man,' but still maintain the perks? Fuck that. The expectations we place on men are there for a reason. Namely, white, socioeconomically privileged men are given HUGE advantages in this society. Being a man means you have more to give, period. And yet, they take, and take and take and take. And don't know any better. How can you be so ignorant? As a cis woman, I face glass ceiling after glass ceiling in my career. The men who would 'mentor,' me tend to just hit on me, and when I reject them, refuse to promote me. The women I work for are struggling themselves, and are usually supported by a man to help them make ends meet financially. 

Not to mention, they got off, and then left immediately. 
""Do you want to get off?"" 

Ohh, no. I'm just the girl who's been accepting a man in silk underwear and a bra in her bed for the first time with an open and supportive mind. Definitely don't even try to grab my boobs or get me off in any way (me entirely clothed, them, mostly naked). I even felt some mild shaming from them about my body hair - total double standard.

Basically, in sum, I'm like, okayyy dude, so you're going to be the entitled overly confident mediocre white man AND wear my underwear, bra and clothes? You really don't know where to stop. 

This person even admitted they decided to become trans after their gf was angry with them for not fulfilling her expectations of being a man (read maybe just respectful partner?!?). 

p.s I expect a ton of backlash here... this isn't easy to articulate. I have some very close trans friends, and I empathize greatly with them. This particular individual though... wth. 

EDIT: Just found this, which seems to go along with my ideas at the moment:

""In a society where men hold power, the most powerful thing a woman can do is to have influence over men. The idea of a member of an oppressed class influencing the powerful is fundamentally threatening to the existing order of society, because it puts some degree of power into the hands of those oppressed people.

I was surprisingly annoyed as a cis woman by this particular person\'s choice to be ""trans."" Okay, so as a trans person, you get to wear women\'s clothes when it suits you, but grow a beard and wear men\'s clothes when it will benefit your career? You don\'t buy me a drink when we go out on our first date, but you get to suggest sex repeatedly throughout the night (when I say I just want to take things slow and connect emotionally), basically, just be an entitled man to the NTH degree. Bragging about your blossoming business and all the connections you have through your family and \'mentors.\' I can\'t take it. I\'m like, okay, so you just want to be a trans person because you want to escape the societal expectations of being a \'man,\' but still maintain the perks? Fuck that. The expectations we place on men are there for a reason. Namely, white, socioeconomically privileged men are given HUGE advantages in this society. Being a man means you have more to give, period. And yet, they take, and take and take and take. And don\'t know any better. How can you be so ignorant? As a cis woman, I face glass ceiling after glass ceiling in my career. The men who would \'mentor,\' me tend to just hit on me, and when I reject them, refuse to promote me. The women I work for are struggling themselves, and are usually supported by a man to help them make ends meet financially. \n\nNot to mention, they got off, and then left immediately. \n""Do you want to get off?"" \n\nOhh, no. I\'m just the girl who\'s been accepting a man in silk underwear and a bra in her bed for the first time with an open and supportive mind. Definitely don\'t even try to grab my boobs or get me off in any way (me entirely clothed, them, mostly naked). I even felt some mild shaming from them about my body hair - total double standard.\n\nBasically, in sum, I\'m like, okayyy dude, so you\'re going to be the entitled overly confident mediocre white man AND wear my underwear, bra and clothes? You really don\'t know where to stop. \n\nThis person even admitted they decided to become trans after their gf was angry with them for not fulfilling her expectations of being a man (read maybe just respectful partner?!?). \n\np.s I expect a ton of backlash here... this isn\'t easy to articulate. I have some very close trans friends, and I empathize greatly with them. This particular individual though... wth. \n\nEDIT: Just found this, which seems to go along with my ideas at the moment:\n\n""In a society where men hold power, the most powerful thing a woman can do is to have influence over men. The idea of a member of an oppressed class influencing the powerful is fundamentally threatening to the existing order of society, because it puts some degree of power into the hands of those oppressed people. \n\nInitially, Siren mythos reflected an existing fear of the female potential to tempt and ruin powerful men.

So he hasn’t been able to take his shot in 2 weeks going onto 3 weeks and he’s starting to get a lot of mood swings.

He called his endocrinologist to refill it and send it to Walgreens but the receptionist wouldn’t let him refill unless he scheduled an appointment which wasn’t going to be until 6 months from now. He made the appointment to get the prescription and they told him they were going to call it into Walgreens the next day. So a few days go by and they didn’t call Walgreens to refill it.

I'm now 17 years old and have lived my whole life as a boy. kinda. I always was more of a girl than a boy. When inwas a child i always had long hair and liked girly things. Well, when i started hitting puberty i felt kinda forced to stop that and be a normal boy, i started to be someone who i really didnt want to be, just so i could fit in. i lost all of my self esteem in the process, started to hate myself, and i just wanst happy over the last two years. Well, now that started to change. Since the last 2 months or so there have been some big changes to myself, started wearing feminine clothes, dyed my hair blue and started wearing makeup. And i love it, it makes me look so much better! Also i've now accepted that i'm pansexual. Well, the thing is, that's not enough. I feel weird in my body, i don't feel like i'm a boy. My parents told me one thing that helped me to understand this: that i wasn't born entirely male. i was born without balls. I had a surgery at the age of one so i could have them, and be a normal boy. it worked, biologically i'm a boy now. But, while my parents could make my body a boy, my brain isn't.

If i could just push a button and wakeup as girl tomorrow, i'd do it. And i would be so so happy.
But, well, thats where my problems start. 

I'm extremely afraid of transitioning. I dont know if i could do it. I'm so afraid that i couldn't pass as a girl, even though i have a very feminine [figure/face](http://imgur.com/8kQdpRR) because my puberty stuffed me full of female hormones. I'm just afraid that people would know that i'm not a real girl. Also my voice is way too deep..  is a deep voice something you can change at all? The thing i'm most afraid of is, that i would loose all of the people i hold dear. I dont know what they would say. I'm afraid that they would see me as a freak. I dont wanna be that.. i dont wanna be a boy in a dress, i wanna be a girl, the one thing i was always meant to be. I know my parents would support me because they know about how i was born. but everyone else..? i get made fun of just for wearing makeup. I feel that, if i'm going to be a girl, then i'd have to start a new life as a girl. Somewhere where no one knows im not really a girl. And i dont know if i could ever do that.

I don't know if i'm fully 100% just a girl tho, like, if i could i would want to swap genders like i want to. I'd like to be a girl mostly but also be able to be a boy sometimes.So maybe i'm bigender? But i guess just fluently changing my gender... will not be a possibility..? i dont know.. being able to do that it would kinda be my dream. i'd be so happy, but i dont know if people could ever accept that

The other thing is i dont know if anyone could love me like that... if i ever could find a boyfriend like that, every straight guy would stop talking to me as soon as he finds out that i'm not a real girl, and gay guys... do they even like super feminine guys that wanna be mostly a girl?

Well, thats it all for now... every help i can get from you guys would be so so so appreciated &lt;3 just tell my your opinion please!

I went through life without questioning gender much... Or rather, efficiently gagging every gender question I ever had to the point of never being aware of my discomfort with my assigned gender. 

At age 34 I realise I'm not entirely happy with the gender I was assigned and I start looking into it. Books, YouTube, forums, talking to people, you know the drill...

At age 35 I realise I'm a woman, but I don't quite ""fit the bill""... That horrible transnormative idea that there is a right way to be a trans woman. I keep second-guessing myself because I have never been truly miserable by how male my body looks. I love having a penis and that's never been a problem.

And then one night, tonight, out of the blue, I'm taking a shower and I look down at this male hairy body and I crumble to bits. At first I stifle my cry telling myself I've been a tad emotional lately, but it doesn't work. Before I realise I'm crying in the shower because of how much that is body isn't me. And I keep going for 30 minutes.

I eventually turn off the water not to waste it, but I keep crying, heaving from my chest and howling like a wounded animal. My face is a mess of tears and drool and snot and there's no end in sight.

I've met a number of guys in the past myself and after hearing about dating stories through others, I came to the conclusion that while many attractive and confident guys date t-girls, and some of them fetishize t-girls...I feel like some straight men seem to date t-girls, not by choice, but out of choice, if that makes sense?

I'm talking about guys who aren't that confident, not really attractive (not ugly though), yet who are into glamorous girls and they stand a zero chance being with glamorous genetic women.

And they don't particularly have a 'thing' for us, yet they go find t-girls on purpose because they think they have found their niche, and know that trans people are still not entirely accepted in society and if they put up with labels, they know they can be with someone hotter, or someone even out of their league.

About me: I‘m 17 / from Austria / have made a post called „ i wanna be a girl and i‘m so afraid of it“ which this post is basically a followup of, you dont have to read the other one too though :). Here‘s some pics of my progress till now : [Crossdressing](http://imgur.com/vDrc3IC)     [Me in 24/7 boy mode](http://imgur.com/plwCOf4)      [My legs i‘m a tiny bit proud of](http://imgur.com/og0l0t3)       

So, after much consideration i‘ve decided that i‘m gonna transition to a woman now. I have a pretty much perfect situation to transition. I‘m 17 and my family is on my side, and will help me, also my best friends also sad they think its cool that i‘m doing this and that they‘re surely be helping me. So everything is going great in that regard. I‘ll go to career school for 9 weeks soon (Jan 7) and that‘s the time i‘m starting my transition. I‘m in school with my 2 best friends. 

So yeah... the thing is, i dont really know where and how to start :(. 

What i‘m doing already: Basic Makeup, Mascara, wearing unisex clothes, crossdressing in private ( i only got 1 dress that doesnt really fit me though). I‘m basically looking like a femboy rn.

I dont know where i should start improving, what i should start doing to look like a girl. I really need help finding out what my next big steps should be, and i hope some of you could help me!
I‘ve included some pics of me. 

I think my face is quite the biggest problem, and i dont know what i should do next to make it look more like a girls. I‘m pretty happy about my figure already but i could surely use some tips to make myself look less flat! 

Also, i really wanna grow my hair out, i want long hair well past my shoulders. I thought that i could accomplish that with extensions? Is my hair long enough to wear extensions, would they work on me or what should i do..? Does anyone have some experience with them? 

I do wanna start with HRT, my parents are okay with it but i‘m a bit confused about the whole process in austria. I dont know where to go really, do i just go to my doctor and tell them about it? I do need some doctors approval to do HRT so i guess i need to visit a psychiatrist...? Also, do you think that HRT would change much about my body? Would it really help me?

2017-12-19 00:12:09,7kpeme,12,14,"I notice the straps to my camisole have fallen off of my shoulders again, and are both sitting on the top of my upper arms, hidden by the pink t-shirt I'm wearing.  I hesitate before fixing this; it occurs to me that this is a thing women do.  This is a thing I do.  The presence of the camisole under my shirt comforts me, a reminder that, though the world presently sees me one way, I am something different.  I lightly smile from the validation as I think...

It's two months ago, give or take some days.  I've just slipped into my wife's Little Mermaid union suit, more than half as a joke.  I'd told a friend earlier that, since I had lost some weight, I'd be willing to try ""cross dressing"" again for kicks.  I used to do it some when I was younger, but I'd since gained weight, and didn't feel I could ""pull off the look"".  My wife had felt a little left out, so hopping into the jumper seemed a good way to make her grin.

My wife, she saw something, though, something I wasn't ready to acknowledge just yet.  She smiled, encouraged me to try on a camisole of hers.  It was light green, and a little too big, but it was nice, comforting.  I felt better than I had in a while.

But it was just a camisole.  Why would a shirt make me feel better?

Flash back years ago.  It's about two decades past, actually, if I'm being honest.  I'm a teenager, and I'm at home by myself.  I can't remember where my younger brother was, but the important thing is he wasn't there.  I'm in my mother's bedroom, and I'm wearing a skirt of hers, as well as a blouse.  I have on a bra stuffed with socks.  I look in the mirror, and my heart is racing.  I'm confused, and excited, and honestly a little aroused.  I didn't understand euphoria, or elation.  I'd never heard the word ""trans"", and transvestites were those gay men who were always killed in movies.  

I thought it was a kink.  I thought the clothes just turned me on.

Now a few years later, I'm eighteen.  I have understanding friends who I spend a lot of time with.  They are older.  They have their own house.  They are the first poly triad I have ever known.  They are caring and accepting.

With their help, I experimented with ""cross dressing"".  I learned to apply basic makeup.  I bought my first panties.  I was happy when I wore these things.  I was a boy wearing women's clothes, and I was happy when I did.

I talked to one of my friends there, stating I wanted to dress like that all the time.  I asked them if they knew anywhere what would allow that.

It was the early two thousands.  They were honest.  They told me that, sometimes men would dress in ""more effiminate"" clothes, in nice pretty shirts and form fitting slacks.

I didn't want that.  I sat there in a lavender tank top and jean shorts with a pretty embroidered flower on the seat, and I began repressing.

Forward now, to just around this time last month.  I've been exploring, talking with my trans friends, talking with my wife.  The moment I realized I wasn't a cis male, that I was ANYTHING else, it was like a sickness had been cured.  So much of my self loathing, my depression, my pain, gone in practically an instant. The concept of internalized dysphoria became evident to me later, explaining so very many things.  I briefly entertained the thought of being genderqueer, but the comfort that I felt from my cotton panties, my new bralette, my camisole...

And I'm back.  I reach under my collar, and pull up my camisole straps.  This is a thing women do.  This is what I do.

2017-12-19 22:42:35,7kwww3,7,4,"One thing that has been an interesting, and upsetting, surprise to me since I came out to myself is the different kinds of dysphoria one can feel.

Understand, before I came out to myself, I didn't realize I was experiencing dysphoria.  I just thought I had a serious self-loathing problem, and was fairly depressed.  I wasn't suicidal, I didn't self harm physically, and I functioned.  I mean, I said some REALLY eggy shit (""I'd obviously prefer to be a woman, men suck, but I am this, and I gotta deal with it""), but I still got by.

Once I realized I wasn't cis, nearly all of that lifted.  After some research, I came to realize this was an internalized dysphoria, manifesting as self loathing.  It felt heavy, and syrupy.  It felt like my everything was weighed down.  It was a limiter on being happy.

Since then, I've experienced two other distinctly different kinds of dysphoria.

The first is, what I understand to be, a fairly traditional dysphoria.  It's realizing that I differ physically from what I understand myself to be emotionally.  This is usually brought on through trans music, writings, or something I make myself, like a poem or an entry on here.  It's the crying, the mild to moderate panic, the anger.  Most of us are familiar with this.

Then, there is what I've started referring to as ""itchy"" dysphoria.  I get this when I have to present male, like at work, or when I do something like going to long since my last Nair session.

Itchy dysphoria feels like wearing a wool jumpsuit with nothing underneath, but emotionally.  It's, like, mildly aggravating, and irritating.  It builds up over time, until I just HAVE to get into some confirming clothes, or get this body hair off, or shave my damned face.  It is frustrating, and bothersome, and well, ""itchy"".

Anybody else get these?  Anybody else get any others?  I'm curious what I might run into down the line.

So, since i found out i wanna be a girl i‘m super super concerned with passing.. i feel like if i couldnt pass i couldnt ever be happy with myself. It’s on my mind 24/7 and i cant stop thinking and worrying about it..

I do already have a very feminine figure, bit when i crossdress and i‘m looking into the mirror i see a boy in a dress, not a girl... The only thing i‘m really happy with is my legs.

So, this is me: pre everything, very slight makeup, no HRT no anything, in a dress. For Fairness i‘ll post a good and a bad pic:

Do you think it would be easy for me to pass or would it be hard? Could i even really pass..? I feel like i could, but i‘m not really sure anymore. I feel way to tall, i hate my long neck ad i really need to do something with my hair. Also this dress (my only one) doesnt fit me at all. 

How long would it take for me to 100% pass as a girl, so that noone would ever think i‘m a boy...? Or would that even be possible? Any tips on what i should do next?

2017-12-22 03:58:20,7lexbb,0,11,"Lasted about a good hour to two hours. Thought I'd document it here.

So a little backstory about me. I'm 31 MtF, been on HRT for about three months (started when I was thirty, but honestly its kind of a nebulous area with dates for me). I've got a bunch of old acne scars (from old self-harm days), though those (I know) only take a little makeup once I get the funds together to purchase some. I don't look the most feminine; in fact, to date the only feminine things about me are my hair and waist curvature, which I've thankfully maintained since I was twelve and trying to figure this shit out (yes, it took me eighteen goddamn years). I've also gained a meager amount of titflesh, which is nice. Also, still living with my parents. That's a story for another time.

Anyway, today was kind of a trainwreck. A scheduled laser consultation (to find out if it can even help with my hair color) at 5, housekeeper comes at 12. Dad comes in, suggests we go out and get a bite to eat while HK does her magic dusting thing. We bounce after establishing that I'm broke (first gaffs, corsetry and bras ain't cheap, yo, gotta get them when the dough is floating) and its on his dime.

Hit up a kind of low-tier would-be classy place, relax, eat food, etc. I'm not presenting in any way other than my hair and voice, and I try to be pretty chill about pronouns and junk. It isn't my way to interrupt flow or try to jam a crowbar in a conversation that would otherwise last five seconds then leave us both feeling awkward.

Anyway, its going fine- up until the point dad starts talking about his family; one of my grandmas and how she's doing, his family tree, and specifically how many suicides he's had in his family tree. Wonderful topics (clap clap). Especially considering this is the same grandma that only a few years ago was, around thanksgiving, telling me she was ready to stop living while I was trying to relax away from the crowd with a quiet cig (social anxiety coupled with minor dysphoria and primary-introvert personality. That's me).

I try not to engage and worked to change topic, but it felt weird. Wouldn't it, for you?

Anyway, about a half hour's gone by, so we finish eating and hop back in the car to go home so I can get ready for laser. ...And the conversation picks up where he left off before, this time about people getting older- like how he's 'twenty years from the average male death' (he's fifty-something), and how he wants to keep working until he kicks the bucket, so he's getting his master's (for the record, I'll be working to get an associate's here soon), yadda yadda, but he keeps hammering this one point- that the 'average male lifespan is seventy-five years'. Now he's a nurse- this kind of statistics shit (something I hold with derison) is his bread and butter, but me? I can't help but shut down. Fucking dying inside, for the first time since starting HRT.

Can't get it out of my head how I should have sprung on this when I was twelve, how I effectively never was a teenager because I never got that angsty 16-year-old girl feels, how I never *will*, how by the time I'm actually the chick outside that I am inside I'll be halfway dead, how I've already had a bit of receding hairline (it isn't bad, my long hair covers it, but I gotta wear a hat when its windy), etc. etc. etc.

And I can't help but put my face in my hands just for some feeling of support. Not crying, mind you. I don't cry. But the only emotion in me right then and there is dread. Not sorrow (that feels different to me. I dunno what, specifically, I was dreading), but dread.

Dad looks over, asks me if I'm okay, I ask (politely as I can. I was pretty shaken, it might have sounded crazier than I wanted it to) for a subject change, or that I can get out and walk home, and he says okay, we'll just go straight home instead of through the car wash. And immediately revs the engine, jumping from 0mph at a stop light to somewhere around 40-50, the wheels swerving as they tried to grip. To be fair, it was a semi-empty road. And we were in mom's sportscar, so maybe he just wanted to have fun with it?

Now its no secret I've had a huge amount of anxiety, ever since I had a bit of a mental breakdown at College Attempt 1. This has lessened a lot (read: 80%) since starting estro, but I can still be a little easy to set off at times with paranoia or worries. Right here, right now, I felt myself crawling up the back of the seat. I don't even know if I said anything, that's how messed up I was right then and there. I still feel it a little, sitting down and writing this up.

""What's wrong with you? Maybe you should talk to your therapist about getting something for your anxiety.""

I didn't even know what to say. Right then and there, I wanted to scream, cry, run and strangle him all at the same time. I literally did not know what to do. He tells me later that he feels like he's walking on eggshells when talking to me, which I don't understand. Maybe he wants someone he can talk to about death and shit all the time? idk. Did I overreact? Am I overthinking this? Is this just all one weird coincidence that got strung together in my head to become despair, or was there some point here that I missed?

But yeah. I'm writing this so that, at some point, I can look back on it with maybe a little more knowledge. And so I can write down this next bit.

I do know one thing. One very, very strange and important thing. One thing of such magnitude that I cannot forget or ignore it, because it is a good thing to come out of a shit day. I have discovered my will to live. Before all this, I was in a daze, learning little and knowing less, likely because my head was filled up with questions I was rejecting the answer to, and it was sapping my interest in survival. I don't think I even registered what it left behind as suicidal thoughts- just emptiness.

But if, in a vehicle I can't control, I suddenly claw my way up the back of the seat out of fear for the way its driving? I know I don't want to die anymore, if I ever did. I feel a need to live, now, if ever. All signs point to this being the right course, even if I started late.

&gt;Kill it, if you have to

&gt;That's the only way to become who you were meant to be

It can apply so much to being transgender. You have to kill who you were in the past in order to create the person you now are. And when you become a Sith/are apprenticed to a Sith, you choose a new name. 

I wonder how many transgender Sith lords there are. The Sith are all about tearing down who you were to become more powerful, and it's not like they'd care if their apprentice is transgender anyways, it's all about their power.

It all started when I saw a television documentary about transsexuals and for some reason I identified myself. I was intrigued by the situation and decided to research more. That was in January, that is, practically 1 year.
From that moment I began to have old memories of when I was little. I remembered when I prayed to God that when I woke up I would become a boy - and I really believed it would work. I did this for a while. I also remember heaving a time (I was still little) where I imagine myself as a boy. There were times when I would put the little shower in the middle of my leg and pretend that it was a penis - please do not laugh about it.
I was still a little kid, I liked a girl (yes I know, sexual orientation is different from gender identity - I am bisexual with preference in women) but she was moving away from me. My thinking was: if the girls her age (she was 2 years older than me) like feminine things, I'll start using. Obviously, I did not last for long. And then came a phase of everyone wanting to change me - maybe people would already be realizing that it was diferente.
And then I grew up a little. By the time I was 13, I began to realize that I was different from the other girls - I always knew, but I was percebed only when I have 13 years at the time. Then I started to be kidden in a healthy way - I told everyone that I was a boy. Was funny.
And then came the documentary at age 14 and we got to where we are ..
I remember when I was little I had also seen another documentary about transsexuals and had identified myself at the time. I was so distressed and wondered why all that identification. She was completely frightened. That intrigued me so much, that I searched the internet about what transgender people were - I had even asked my mother but she did not know what it was either - it happened that I ended up excluding all this idea from the head and I thought, 'Ah, it should not be anything at all ''. I literally forgot in 3 seconds what it was like to be transsexual.
I'm afraid that all this is just a phase - no matter how much I look at the past at this moment, I realize that this has been with me for a long time.

2017-12-27 01:25:56,7mbupu,10,11,"This is another post that's as much for me as it is for anyone it might help, but you all haven't been upset about that so far, so...

It's been two months, about, since I realized I was a trans woman.  And I still misgender myself.

And I wanted to know why.  So I did the only thing I could think to do, which was think about it a lot.

What I've realized is, well, kinda weird.

When I thought I was a guy, I was miserable.  I mean, I didn't realize *how* miserable, because really, I'd just become extremely numb.  I mean, I'd have highs and lows, but looking back, everything was very muted.  I was nothing but shades of gray and brown, washed out, with differences only really standing out in comparison to the rest of me.

As I've said in previous posts, once I realized I was not cis, and especially when I understood I was a woman, I could *feel*.  This fog, this weight of what I thought was simple self loathing, it lifted off of me.  I could experience ambition and motivation again.  I could enjoy the moment.  I smiled.

I also cried.  And I can't handle as much stress.  I can't tune out the emotional turbulence like I used to.

And I noticed, when I would misgender myself, it was often in times of stress.  My thoughts of ""what if this is all just a phase"" would come at my worst times.

Understand, if I embrace my femininity during these times, that also makes me feel better.  But instead, I find myself leaning into the old ""you're just a guy"" idea.

I realized that the apathy, that numbness, that constant pain, gave me a perverse, self deprecating strength.  See, I was already hurting so much, more pain wasn't a big deal.  I was already so stressed, more was a marble on the pile.  I had cultivated an almost nihilistic apathy as a coping mechanism, and then used that as a coping mechanism against other stresses.

It was a crutch.  A broken, damaging crutch. And part of me misses it.

I don't miss thinking I was a guy, mind you.  But I miss that ability to just ""handle"" anything.  To put myself in a box, and sort it out later, so I could handle the now.

But that isn't good. It isn't healthy.  I wasn't caring for myself, I was emotionally lobotomizing myself to progress through life.  Yeah, I got pretty good at it, but it was still damaging me.

So, now I'm making a conscious effort to lean into my gender more.  To embrace myself as a woman, and internalize the joy it brings me.  And yes, the stress is harder.  And hardships hurt a little more, and I can weather a lot less.  But I can be happy.  I can like myself.  

I'd forgotten what it's like to like yourself.

So, I guess my point is, if you find yourself doubting your ""transness"", stop and ask why.  Really think about it.  Because you might just be missing what you were used to, even if it was hurting you.

She’s never left there, didn’t want to go to college, works odd jobs on different ranches or at the ski resort. But lately she has seemed depressed.

Her parents are divorced and both live in town. My
Brother, her father, is a great guy, would do anything for her, she lives with him, and they have always been close. But he is a typical emotionally closed off male. He doesn’t talk about anything other than work. My whole family, myself included, can be like this. We don’t talk about feelings much in my family.

She has always been a “tomboy”.  Her mom tried to dress her up with make up and all for her high school graduation. The most awkward picture ever. She was obviously miserable. 

I’ve never known her to date anyone. I suspect she is interested in women. But more I suspect she may be struggling with gender identity issues and I don’t think she has anyone she can talk to about it. I don’t think she knows there are communities and resources that support people embracing themselves in this manner.

I live in a liberal urban area with a strong lgbt community. I have trans friends and my wife, a teacher, has worked with many trans youth. It breaks my heart thinking my niece might be struggling with something that I have seen drive others to suicide. And it also gives me hope knowing that many, with the love of community and family, emerge from these struggles as strong vibrant humans embracing life.

I know my brother would support her. I’ve talked to my mom, her grandma, who is 80 and has suspected the same. We would all support her. But how do we let her know this is ok? What she is feeling is ok?

All that said, maybe she’s not. Maybe she’s just a strong butch. A Tom boy. Maybe she loves men and just doesn’t feel attractive. I don’t know. All I know is regardless, I want her to know we support her.

2017-12-30 21:39:15,7n49hm,4,22,"After all this time, i'm still questioning my gender identity. I'm currently 19 years old.

The first time i started questioning myself was 5 years ago, when i was 14. I didn't knew anything about being transgender/genderqueer or anything until i was 15. But i felt like there is something wrong with me. Then i found a random video on YouTube about a transgender man who talked about his transitioning. The whole thing just blow my mind and i felt like i finally knew who i'm. I did a lot of research about trans people, different identities, surgeries, hormone therapy and name changing. After all this i felt like o know what i want &amp; i was so happy. So i thought i should came out to my best friend.

However when i /tried to/ came out to her, she said i'm too feminie to ever pass as a guy. This made me really depressed and broken. So for a whole year i give up on this whole gender identity thing. I tried to be more feminine &amp; just be a regular teenager and try to get a boyfriend. However i just got more &amp; more depressed so i give up on that too.

A year later when i was 16, i become really anxious about everything and i realized i can't just let this gender thing go. I tried to become more masculine and cut my hair shorter, wore male clothes and also tried to bind my chest down with the only things i had back in the day, bandages &amp; sport bra's.

I felt so much happier but i still felt like something is wrong. In the same year, i met with a girl who later on become my first partner and girlfriend. She was lesbian so i thought maybe i should be more feminine, for her. Later on, i realized once again i was not happy like that so i just stopped it and tried to be even more masculine than before.

And an another year passed. I was 17 and my parents slowly noticed my changing and they were really mad. Mostly because my mother really disliked the relationship between me and my girlfriend. She thought i try to be more manly for her etc. I remember i once stole an unused underwear from my father who didn't mind it, but when my mother found it she was mad and went crazy on me saying things like ""you'll never have a dick get used to it"".

My girlfriend on the other hand asked me about this 'manly style of mine', and i don't remember how but i came out to her. She cried for weeks, and asked me to never go on hormones and stuff. Hovewer, months later she accepted me and said she will love me no matter what.

An another year passed, i was still unhappy but felt better than before because i felt like i was closer to accepting myself. I was 18 when my parents disowned, and kicked me out. They had enough of me &amp; my girlfriend. So i moved to my gf &amp; her mother.

I felt more free than before actually. I finally got my first real chest binder, i was able to cut my hair more shorter and i could buy my own clothes from the man's section.

So.. Now i'm 19, and another year passed. I got a job, and i live in an apartment with my girlfriend. I was also able to get a packer/STP what actually helps a lot. And for the first time, i actually visited a therapist to finally start my transitioning i've been waiting for.

But after all this time, i still have some doubts. I'm afraid i'm just faking it. I'm afraid i just ""want to be transgender"" so it would be easier for me to understand myself. I'm afraid it's just a phase. My psychologist said, that transitioning might be not the best idea because after that i might still be feeling depressed and empty.

I don't really like feminine things but sometimes i wear makeup &amp; dresses at home just for fun. Maybe it will sound strange but i still don't feel like a woman when i do that. I rather feel like a drag queen maybe..? Also i'm really attracted to guys. I've never been attracted to girls that much. I just say i'm bi/pansexual. But i don't know anymore. So i don't know what's up with me anymore.. When i was smaller i always hang out with boys &amp; i always dreamed about growing up to be a handsome man. I thought it was weird at the time, but i always imagined myself as a man when i grow up. Also there was a time when i asked my mother if she wanted to have a boy or a girl. She said she wanted a boy. And i said, ""well you can be happy because you got one"" and laught. I don't know where did that came from.. And there were other times when my family referred to me as a girl and i said 'but i'm not a girl'. 

I feel like it's weird but still.. What if i'm right? I'm afraid i will make a really bed decision with this..",trans,Am i transgender?,1514695155.0,"{'created_utc': 1514669955, 'id': '7n49hm', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 22, 'selftext': 'After all this time, i\'m still questioning my gender identity.
