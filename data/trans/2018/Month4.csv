I'm a teenage male, and I've thought about the concept of being a girl for 5 years, and other vague memories of similar things as far as 8 years back.

My feelings about this have kinda been 
on-and-off for the past years. I can say I've probably completely forgotten about this at least 3 times, only to have my feelings return.

I don't feel uncomfortable in my current body.
It doesn't feel weird to be called by male words.
I don't feel like a woman in a man's body.

I feel like a man who wants to be a woman.

For the past 5 or so months, I've had increasingly strong feelings about this.

I'm just wondering about if I should try to come out and transition, or if I should just ignore the feelings.

2018-04-03 06:08:57,89ajvt,1,1,"So at the beginning of December last year I got on hormones (2mg estrogen + 100mg spiro 2x a day). I had pretty much zero negative side effects after the first few weeks and I was very happy with the results I was seeing (Way less hair growth and it lightened up a lot, more female body shape and breast development). I went in for blood work around the 20th of February, had a follow up appointment 2 weeks later to go over it. 

They didn't call me or anything before this even though they had the results and claimed my testosterone was at 1 and my Estrogen was at 800 when they went over my blood work. The doctor accused me of overdosing even though I had been taking it exactly as prescribed and I had even missed doses a few times. After that appointment they cut my dosages in half and switched me from 90 days of meds to 30 days about a month ago. I was fine with that but a little weary of the results as I had been feeling great and really happy with the results over 3 months and I was finally able to get a job again after being unemployed for 8 months.

Note: Pre HRT I had perfectly normal hormone levels for a male. I was 20 at the start of HRT and recently turned 21.

So forward to a month later and almost all the positive effects have reversed to near pre HRT while being on 1mg estrogen + 50mg spiro 2x a day. I have also developed an eating disorder, insomnia, hot/cold flashes, headaches, severe mood swings and extremely bad depression which all mixed together caused me to lose my job about a week ago.

My HRT doctor's office refused to test my blood now and said I had to wait till next week for an appointment with my doctor there to go over my issues. So I will be going to my primary care doctor tomorrow and hopefully be able to get a hormone test from a different lab. I was able to get a copy of both my pre hrt and 3 month HRT blood work test and archive it with my primary doctor so there is records of it in more than one location.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with blood test? Because I am extremely skeptical that I actually went from normal Testosterone and estrogen levels to 1 testerone and 800 estrogen in 3 months on a pretty moderate dose. Should I look into legal help if I get blood test elsewhere and they don't match up as this has severely impacted my life.

Note: I am going to hopefully be switching HRT doctors soon. Unfortunately I live in Oklahoma so barely any exist here and having to wait 3 months between normal appointments is ridiculous.

tl;dr:

2018-04-08 10:01:35,8ap27j,8,16,"Hey y'all. First off, thanks for being beautiful. You've already helped me figure out a lot.

Maybe a little too much, too fast. Start to finish I've certainly taken my time considering this - my first inkling that I may be trans was winter '16/17 but my dumb ass never thought to look for trans subreddits until a month or two ago, and all doubt was removed from my mind VERY quickly. I'm also a very vocal proponent of being a very vocal proponent, and am fortunate enough to live in a liberal state with leftist friends, so I came out the moment I was certain. Even at work, they're calling me by my name despite being (almost) pre-everything. I haven't gotten anything but support from the people I know irl and it's been amazing seeing the outpouring of love, but that makes me feel so much weaker for crying away the weekend while browsing reddit and facebook looking for anyone to talk to long enough to distract me from my perpetual breakdown.

I feel like I've been working through 30 years worth of unbearable emotions in a single month. All the doubt, the fear, the torture I put myself through trying to live like this. All the hatred for my own younger self for putting this aside, for failing to see what's now so obvious, for not taking the opportunity when I had a better job with better insurance and more free time and was still living with my family, all of whom would have supported me just as strongly as they are now but from down the hall, not across the city. When I was young enough for more to happen, and faster, and better. When I was young enough to take advantage of the clarity and serenity that I've only ever been able to grasp for brief moments of drug-fueled dissociation before this past month. I know regretting it isn't going to change it, and I know there's an astonishing number of wonderful people who only figured it out when they were twice my age, but I can't help feeling awful and I don't know how to move on.

I'm terrified of what's to come. Even putting aside the risk of social ostracization (my job is very community-oriented, at that), the risk of hateful people destroying my body (which has happened to a family friend, even here in liberal country), the risk of medical complications, the risk of financial disaster (I was scraping by before I started looking into treatment), nothing in life has ever demanded so much sheer effort or commitment. I've never cared about anything like this transition, and the idea of actually having to work for something for the first time makes me wonder whether I even have the fortitude to do so. I care enough to put in the work...I think? I care enough that not knowing whether I do is crushing.

Feeling anything at all is terrifying me. None of my self-abuse ever felt wrong or worth changing because I couldn't imagine a life worth living, but now that the door is open I'm actually hearing the insults I hurl at myself, and they actually hurt. I'm looking at my yellow-ass teeth that were never worth taking care of, and my bones that are creaking before their time. I'm looking at my empty savings, and looking back at the years of drugs and alcohol that burned through the money I could have put toward school or surgery or fucking anything that would have lasted.

First off, thanks for being beautiful. You've already helped me figure out a lot.\n\nMaybe a little too much, too fast. Start to finish I've certainly taken my time considering this - my first inkling that I may be trans was winter '16/17 but my dumb ass never thought to look for trans subreddits until a month or two ago, and all doubt was removed from my mind VERY quickly. I'm also a very vocal proponent of being a very vocal proponent, and am fortunate enough to live in a liberal state with leftist friends, so I came out the moment I was certain. Even at work, they're calling me by my name despite being (almost) pre-everything. I haven't gotten anything but support from the people I know irl and it's been amazing seeing the outpouring of love, but that makes me feel so much weaker for crying away the weekend while browsing reddit and facebook looking for anyone to talk to long enough to distract me from my perpetual breakdown.\n\nI feel like I've been working through 30 years worth of unbearable emotions in a single month. All the doubt, the fear, the torture I put myself through trying to live like this. All the hatred for my own younger self for putting this aside, for failing to see what's now so obvious, for not taking the opportunity when I had a better job with better insurance and more free time and was still living with my family, all of whom would have supported me just as strongly as they are now but from down the hall, not across the city. When I was young enough for more to happen, and faster, and better. When I was young enough to take advantage of the clarity and serenity that I've only ever been able to grasp for brief moments of drug-fueled dissociation before this past month. I know regretting it isn't going to change it, and I know there's an astonishing number of wonderful people who only figured it out when they were twice my age, but I can't help feeling awful and I don't know how to move on.\n\nI'm terrified of what's to come. Even putting aside the risk of social ostracization (my job is very community-oriented, at that), the risk of hateful people destroying my body (which has happened to a family friend, even here in liberal country), the risk of medical complications, the risk of financial disaster (I was scraping by before I started looking into treatment), nothing in life has ever demanded so much sheer effort or commitment. I've never cared about anything like this transition, and the idea of actually having to work for something for the first time makes me wonder whether I even have the fortitude to do so. I care enough to put in the work...I think? I care enough that not knowing whether I do is crushing.\n\nFeeling anything at all is terrifying me. None of my self-abuse ever felt wrong or worth changing because I couldn't imagine a life worth living, but now that the door is open I'm actually hearing the insults I hurl at myself, and they actually hurt. I'm looking at my yellow-ass teeth that were never worth taking care of, and my bones that are creaking before their time. I'm looking at my empty savings, and looking back at the years of drugs and alcohol that burned through the money I could have put toward school or surgery or fucking anything that would have lasted. I can't stand what I've let myself become for the ignorance of what I could become, and it feels like the mistakes I've already made have ruined my potential.\n\nEven now that I'm finally doing electrolysis and vocal training and going to see a doctor about some skittles later this week, I'm just crushed by the injustice of being born this way.

I'm all for it, but the problem is that I don't really have the means to do any of that. I'm clueless when it comes to really anything. I think it could be worth it to come out to my mom, because then I wouldn't have to try to be secretive, and could actually buy things online.

Just recently, I've gotten a huge wave of confidence, and I want to come out real soon.

Is there any tips for coming out? I may be confident about myself alone, but I can easily see myself mussing up in my attempt to come out. Or is doing it over text okay? Because I would prefer that much more.

What's the best way to say it? So far, the best I can describe it is like ""I think I might be transgender."" I want to ask for her help, but I also want to be sensitive about her views on this.

2018-04-10 10:58:11,8b6q4h,17,19,"Tonight, I learned that I am ignorant about Trans people and it’s upsetting to me, because I am genuinely loving of all people and I don’t like hurting anyone.  

Here is what I did.  

I bought into the narrative that Trans people will flip at you for using the wrong gender pronoun.  

The reason I bought into this narrative; was because of one single experience that I had with a trans person who got angry at me for mistaking their gender and publicly shamed me, in front of A LOT of people.  

It was very embarrassing for me.  I walked away thinking differently.  I walked away thinking most trans must be like that, and didn’t look into it further because I was angry for being treated that way.   (I did this, despite even knowing a trans person who is an acquaintance of mine, and I know that they would NEVER flip at anyone.)  

THAT, was wrong of me.  THAT, was FLAWED LOGIC.

Then, tonight, I made a post giving my erroneous opinions based on that narrative, without even thinking about the emotional effects it might have .  It seems stupid, but it’s very easy to buy into a narrative about any group of people and I did it to this group.

So, I’d like to let you know that I’ll be looking into Trans culture and learning more about it from this subreddit to help prevent me from doing something like that again.  

I am a cis-gendered white male, and I am looking forward to learning more about your culture and how to be respectful of it.  I hope that whatever struggles you face as a Trans person today, will be easier on you.  I would be more specific, but without being a trans person myself; I can’t truly claim to know what those struggles are.  It would be a fake gesture.

I walked away thinking differently.  I walked away thinking most trans must be like that, and didn’t look into it further because I was angry for being treated that way.

THAT, was FLAWED LOGIC.\n\nThen, tonight, I made a post giving my erroneous opinions based on that narrative, without even thinking about the emotional effects it might have .

I am currently running a consultation period for my website https://transgirlsays.mn.co/

I am looking for ideas on how to move forward and create meaningful content for a global transgender community as well as new team members to head up different initiatives on the network.

We are a multimedia platform designed to bring news, lifestyle content and transition advice to the community, as well as connect people with their local community and people in a similar situation.

I need contributors for TransGuySays (a project that is yet to find a home, but will do soon). I also need consultation for how to integrate the non-binary area of the network.

I also want to make a home for family members of trans people, a home for support groups to liaise with each other and special channels for community project and groups.

The company is not for profit (unregistered at the moment), but has a very socially conscious financial set up.

If you have any skills or interest in helping develop this community, please let me know. Either here, via private message or come and find me at https://transgirlsays.mn.co/

Many thanks

2018-04-11 17:09:29,8biql8,6,2,"Sorry this is pretty long lol


I've been questioning if I'm trans (ftm) for about a year now, and within the past couple weeks it seems like everything's crashing down. Basically, I need advice on how to move forward because I feel really stuck. I don't know if I'm faking what I'm feeling or if it's actually real.


I think everything started way back to when I started middle school. Since everyone in my grade had just moved into a new school, I decided to go along with what every other girl was doing and make myself really feminine and ""grown-up"", ignoring how much I absolutely hating how I looked in makeup and earrings and feminine clothes. This didn't last for long: I ended 8th grade wearing big t-shirts and jeans, and with debilitating social anxiety and depression. Fun! 


Going into high school, for some reason I really really wanted to cut my hair short. I'd seen pictures of afab people with short haircuts on tumblr and really identified with it. Once the idea was in my mind, I really thought it would help my social anxiety even though I didn't know why. Sadly, my mother would only let me get it cut shoulder length and ""maybe get it cut shorter later in stages"". 
sidenote: Now almost 18, I FINALLY have the haircut I wanted at age 13.


I started, almost obsessively, watching trans guys on youtube about halfway through high school (I'm a senior now), and found myself really connecting to them. Hearing their experiences made me wonder if the social disconnect and discomfort I had been feeling since I was about 12 had anything to do with gender identity, even though I had never thought of myself as being uncomfortable with my body.


Fast forward to about a year ago, I started to really dislike my chest. I would wear a jacket no matter how hot it got just to hide it. Again, I found solace in obsessively watching trans youtubers almost daily (I haven't stopped since lol), and as spring turned into summer and my depression worsened, that was pretty much the only thing I did. I found a way to flatten my chest using a camisole with elastic, and for the first time since getting my hair cut shorter I felt more confident in myself and my body (but also more anxious about hurting my ribs and about what I was feeling meant). This was when I started to question if I was a trans guy, or maybe nonbinary. I was positive I felt a disconnect from the terms ""girl"", ""woman"", etc.


As this new school year started, I absolutely hated myself. My mother forced me to wear makeup and clothes I was uncomfortable in for ""senior portraits"" despite my protests. I spent three hours at a photoshoot literally wanting to die from anxiety and discomfort at my body and appearance. Meanwhile, my depression was getting worse and worse, and questioning my gender identity was making everything harder. I really wanted to start dressing more masculinely but I was terrified to. Eventually, I found the confidence to buy a couple things from the mens section even with my mother disgusted at me for doing so, and bought some things from thrift stores to try out. With new clothes, a flatter chest, and finally getting the haircut I wanted, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT MYSELF AND SO MUCH MORE CONFIDENT IT'S CRAZY! :D


However, with all these new aesthetic changes I still don't really know how I feel about my gender identity. I REALLY don't think of myself as a ""girl"", and I'm surprised and uncomfortable when I realize people see me as one. I also realized recently that I'm So! Incredibly! JEALOUS! of cis guys, and I think I always have been even though I didn't connect the dots until now. I really wish I had a masculine chest and height and VOICE and mannerisms etc. I've been feeling more and more disconnected with my name and she/her pronouns too.


But at the same time I'm worried constantly if I'm faking all of these feelings and just.... I don't know. I'm always unsure of everything. I don't know how I'd feel with he/him pronouns or a new name. I'm just terrified and don't know what to think. I don't know if I'm trans, or non binary, or just stupid. I can't talk to anyone about this either, which really sucks. In general I'm just extremely terrified and unsure of the future and I don't know what to do next.

I’m new to this sub, and I’m seeking some advice/opinions. I’m a cis woman - I have a genetic condition which causes (among other things) genital ambiguity, which means I have an unusually large clitoris.

2018-04-14 03:09:06,8c4wk9,4,4,"In 2015 I realized I was ftm. I realized I was bi a little later. So before recently, I'd always been a really masculine person, and I had a lot of dysphoria. I would throw a fit if I had to wear a women's sweater. I didn't have all that much body dysphoria, but I hated it when I didn't pass as male. Having long hair made me want to crawl under a rock and never leave. I got my hair cut and feel a lot better.

But about a year ago I began to embrace my femininity. It's probably because I began to pass, and didn't feel like I had to constantly prove myself to be a guy anymore. Accepting my bisexuality played a part too, because before then, I was in a lot of denial. I went from not wanting anything to do with femininity and wearing the same ugly sweatshirt and baggy jeans each day, to being extremely feminine and putting way too much thought into my wardrobe so quickly. I don't mind wearing certain articles of women's clothing if I like it. I've found some awesome things in the women's section. As long as it doesn't prevent me from passing, I'll buy it. Sometimes my body will look really feminine, and I don't feel like I have a problem with it. Sometimes I'll look really feminine, but think I look good. My hips will be large, my chest won't be flat, but I don't feel much discomfort about it. But it still feels wrong when people refer to me as female. I now barely feel very dysphoric, even when I have plenty of reason to. My chest is no longer flat, my face is way more feminine, and sadly, I don't pass as often as I used to. I used to be able to wear a fucking women's swimsuit and people would still perceive me as male. Yeah, it was a swim shirt and board shorts, but it was still obviously women's swimwear. But now I can't pass often. And I don't really feel that bad about it. Sometimes it gets me down, but I guess I just don't think about it much.

Now I'm having doubts about being trans. I went through the same thing last year. I'm just scared of the idea of growing out of this. I've fought so hard to be accepted, and it would suck so bad if this all ended up being a phase. Being ftm has definitely become a part of my identity, and I don't want to lose that. Sometimes I get nervous about the idea of medical transition. I don't want to be a big hairy guy (no offense to you big hairy guys out there). I don't want a super deep voice. I'd rather I had a voice that was kind of high pitched, but still distinguishable as male. Today I took a bunch of selfies, and I was passing really well. But for some reason it felt weird. I looked really masculine, and for some reason I didn't really like that? Idk. At least I looked photogenic in those selfies for once lol. I feel comfortable as the boy I am now, but I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of being a man. Lately the doubt has been getting a lot worse. I'm just really scared of possibly growing out of this. Being male has been a large part of my identity for my whole life, even before I realized I was trans. I just really don't want to lose that. I know it would be a lot easier just being a cis girl, but I'll feel like I've lost a huge part of my identity. But I don't want to go right on hormones and then end up regretting it later. I don't feel much body dysphoria. What if I go on T and start feeling dysphoric due to the changes? I went through the exact same thing last year. I had all these doubts and fears.

So I realized that our Discord server, Transgender Talk, has been slow lately because we don't advertise it anywhere. The only place people can get to it is through our Chatzy page because that's where Transgender Talk started. Thus, I am here to advertise our server! Here is the link: 

https://discord.gg/ck76Ap5

If I had to describe the server, I'd say it's pretty chill in comparison to some trans servers I've joined. We have more tolerance for divisive discourse, and I don't feel we police or try to stop discussions, though we do try to remain respectful and attentive to the needs of others. I have a ton of appreciation for this aspect of our server because I feel that openness plays a crucial role in constructing safe spaces.  Some rules, such as keeping adult content in the adult channel or keeping sensitive discussions in support, are definitely necessary and should be enforced.  However, an overreliance on rules can prevent potentially constructive conversations from occurring. It is difficult for people to practice freedom of expression when they fear scrutiny or when they are expected to remember a long list of topics that require trigger warnings or must follow a set of highly specific instructions just to communicate on a server.  At a certain point, these dynamics seem to prioritize arbitrary discipline over actual empathy toward other people.  My personal belief is that it is far better to participate in an ongoing dialogue about these types of issues as they arise so that everyone can learn how to support one another more effectively and can practice being more conscientious of words that might harm others (a.k.a. call-in vs. call-out culture).  For these reasons, I feel extremely comfortable on this server and view it as a positive place.  I would also say that our server attracts a mostly 18+ crowd, as our youth members tend to spend more time on Chatzy.

Anyway, thanks for your time, and I look forward to seeing new virtual faces soon :)

2018-04-16 22:10:19,8crigs,5,12,"So for the last month or so, I've really been lost on how I identify. I'm AFAB, but something about that never felt quite right. I always knew I was different from the girls I was made to be around, but I could never figure out just what it was. I was always my happiest around boys, in school, with my cousins, etc., but Around 4th or 5th grade I was getting bullied for being ""not like other girls,"" and I dedicated pretty much the rest of my life to trying to be as girly and feminine as I possibly could be. I alienated myself from everything related to boys and masculinity. 

Fast forward, I'm a freshman in college. I've since made friends with people from all walks of life, reconnected with my guy friends from my past, whatever. 

I'm starting to question my identity, though. I've always felt uncomfortable with my body, and I realize that now. A sort of repressed memory resurfaced not too long ago, I was a little kid and just having an absolute panic attack about how I was getting breasts and how horrified I was at having to wear a bra and ""start being a woman."" It felt so wrong. It still does. I always just wrote that off as ""puberty is weird for everyone, right?"" but that memory, along with so many others, are all starting to set off red flags and ""clicks"" in my head that something's been different all along.

I had trans friends before, I just never thought to apply it to myself because I was still trying so hard to do my job of ""being a woman."" But now that I'm considering that this is what I might be, I'm lost. It feels so right, and yet it also terrifies me, like I'm abandoning some part of me. 

I started keeping track of my feelings, documenting every single day for about a month now how I felt. For about a week straight, I'd feel like this, dysphoric, and then somewhere in between, for a day or two, it'd all be gone again, and during this time, I find myself saying things like, ""I'm being stupid; that was nothing; I'm just being influenced by others; I'm just lonely and I want a community to belong to, THAT's why I was being so weird, right?; What does gender even mean, why be worried about it?; I've always been somewhat ok with being a girl until now, why is it suddenly bothering me so much?; I like wearing girly clothes still, see?"" and I somehow talk down these feelings, and I feel like I'm ""comfortable"" again, and I don't mind being female as much. 

And then it just cycles back around, and I'm frustrated all over again. 

Mind you, I grew up in a VERY anti lgbt household/family. And, my dad's always been one to talk down my feelings \(related to other things, I haven't mentioned this to either of them.\) I notice, though, that sometimes when I'm talking to myself like this, it's almost like his voice is my own; like I'm thinking like him. It's weird. 

It might be internal transphobia. It might be me trying to tell myself the truth. It might be me lying to myself. I don't know what to believe anymore.

The change seems to occur most in people between the age of 8 and 20, when the human body is most into it's stage of growth, when hormones are surging and the mind is most unstable.

The desire to switch gender usually comes from the idea that the grass is greener on the other side, for the majority it is that they wish to become a woman, so they never have to grow up, so that they can remain childish and mothered by other people - so that they never have to go through adulthood. Lazy, selfish. I find most trans are incredibly narcissistic too, victims of their own complex now that they have designed, in a way, their dream girl, having given up looking for her, they become her, then wear her like a corpse over their real identity, and act as her, fooling others.

Having others see you as what you want is manipulation, it does not matter how you put it, and trans are sly, damaged people  who live through manipulation of themselves and their surroundings.

Obviously I support them. As another nonbinary person it would be hypocritical not to, and as I love them I especially love them.

However.

I'm autistic which makes change something incredibly difficult to deal with. It's not that I don't want to, it's that I'm neurologically wired to have change overwhelm me in the worst ways possible. So it's not just ""I prefer things staying the same"", its ""large changes fill me with so much anxiety I have averse physical and mental side effects for long periods of time and it keeps me awake"".

Additionally, I've found myself to prefer intimacy with penis-havers. I hate admitting that this is part of my unease, but unfortunately I can't shake it.

I love my partner immensely and hate the idea of my fear of change and sexual preferences getting in the way of what we have. I feel terrible for even having these hangups. It feels selfish and I know I love them more than my anxiety. 

Is there any way or advice on how to healthily deal with my problems surrounding this? I feel like trying to ignore the issue and bottle it will only make it grow and potentially cause emotional distance between us, and potentially ruin what we have.

I was a child that didn't share toys all that well. Anytime a friend had a toy, I wanted that toy to almost the exclusion of all others. Pretty much didn't matter what I had.

From the bottom of my stomach, like somebody has caught my midsection with their fishing line and is reeling me in. I feel drawn to the pretty girls I see around me. I'm a girl who likes girls (a happily married one at that.)

Don't think.
Don't stop.
Don't rest.
Just work.

Anything but nothing.
That'll keep them at bay.
The thoughts,
They'll stay away.

But then I look.
It was an accident.
A forgotten mirror.
A puddle of water.

The feelings flood in.
Cold and empty.
Lonely as a void.
No one around for miles.

Its almost funny.
How heavy nothing can feel.
Unladened yet over encumbered.
A blanket of shame
No one else can see.

One day I will be fine.
I'll rise with the sun.
Feel right as rain,
And carry on.
No one will be wiser
To the internal struggle
Burried inside.

But that day isn't today.
At least not right now,
Not in that way.
Because today I fucked up.
I looked left.
I should have looked right.

I'm a (currently) gay-identified AMAB and always thought of gender as strictly biological until the past couple years. It's taken me a while to gain an understanding of how various people conceptualize gender today &amp; a lot of what I hear has caused me to question my own gender identity. I'm trying to avoid typing a long paragraph so I'll just list off the reasons for this crisis.

-When I was a kid, my brother and I would play pretend together &amp; often battle one another as our favorite superheroes. He would play as Superman, I'd play as Sailor Moon. I would also daydream and pretend to be various Disney princesses.

-As a kid I also went through a phase of wearing shirts &amp; towels on my head like wigs, flipping them around, and ""pretending"" to be a girl. I feel like I would have continued to do it had my older sister not shamed me for it. I didn't stop right away though, I would just do it in the mirror in the bathroom with the door locked but my dad walked in on me doing it once and shamed me, which is when I stopped altogether.

-After becoming aware of my innate homosexuality as a teenager &amp; going through the whole denial / acceptance number, I vowed I would never be ""one of those flamboyant gays"" even though I was still low-key feminine / ""gay looking"" and just not very self-aware lol.

-As I've become more comfortable with my sexuality &amp; made new friends (mostly girls or other gay men) I've felt less restricted in my behavior and tend to act authentically in stereotypically ""gay"" ways (though I think feminine might be a better word but idek what that even means anymore?) around these friends which I would never have DREAMED of doing as a teenager.

-I dress very ""trade"" in public, I have a shaved head &amp; facial hair, tend to attract submissive girls &amp; gay boys looking for the whole daddy dom thing but my personality / sexual preferences are the exact opposite. Looking back I think I consciously started to dress / act more ""straight"" because of ""masc for masc"" culture in the gay world but now it feels like an act I'm putting on to blend in.

-I did an impromptu drag performance (well, moreso gender-bending than full on drag) at a friend's show recently, really got in the zone, was dancing / behaving in ways I never do in public, felt amazing, received so much praise, felt good about myself &amp; was incredibly uninhibited (never am).

I'm feeling like I've repressed a lot of my feelings because I was always shamed for acting how I felt and am only just now coming to realize it.

2018-04-26 00:43:56,8eymvj,3,1,"Hello everyone.

I am currently writing a story and I am trying to start planning out some scenes ahead of time. The reason why I am bringing this up here is because one of the characters of my story is a trans woman. In this story, the reader and the majority of the other characters are not immediately aware the character is trans. However, about half way through the story the main character will profess his feelings for her and this will cause her to feel obligated to reveal to him that she is trans. This is a rather important scene for my story so even though I am nowhere close to writing this specific part I want to start planning out some of the details because I want it to have a strong emotional impact while also maintaining a level of realism. As a cis male though I have no real life experience to draw upon for this scene so I was hoping to get some advice from everyone.

The general scene set up as I have it potentially planned out now is that up to this point it has been implied that she has had a secret that she has kept from all the other characters except her best friend. The main characters confesses his feelings for her only for her to quickly turn him down. It quickly becomes apparent that she feels the same about him and she only turned him down out of fear of how he would react to the truth. After a push from her best friend she reveals to the main character, and the reader, that she is trans. The main character is admittedly surprised by this but does make it clear that it does not affect how he feels for her, and the two officially start going out from this point on in the story.

The main things I want advice for is her reluctance to tell the truth and his reaction to said truth. Like I said, this is a very important scene to me and if a single thing is off I feel like the whole thing can fall flat. So, what advice would you give me? Is there any significant pitfalls other writers have made that you would advise me to avoid?

It seems really pathetic asking for money and some might say to get a job and I do. I work a minimum wage job at old navy. I don’t have time to take so many hours because I’m in school and dealing with poor mental health and dysphoria. 
I currently owe the hospital $900 for a top surgery CONSULT. I have a bill under my birth name of $900 because I went to go SIT and TALK to a plastic surgeon and had measurements and pictures taken, all things that I can do on my own for free. On top of that I need to pay $76 every 3 months for testosterone and $150 for a name change.
And that’s not all, I received a bill of $200 for using my university’s health services for 2 visits for a bacterial infection and the flu. I am at fear of going back to the doctors because I’m afraid to be slapped in the face with another medical bill because my insurance won’t cover it. I’m at the point that I won’t schedule a visit with the psychiatrist in order to get a prescription I really need because I’m afraid I’m going to have to worry about more bills to pay off.
I am currently struggling financially and I’m trying to do what ever side jobs I can with walking the neighborhood dogs, selling old things, and even relying on cyber sex work in addition to my retail job to try to get any money I can.
