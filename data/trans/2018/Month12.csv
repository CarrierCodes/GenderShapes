--------

I could never cry past the age of 8 or so. Even when I had those terrible mood swings in middle school from hormones and bad meds. 

Instead I would fall into an emotional process that took almost an entire day to complete, and often exhausted my entire family. It would start hours of seething irritation, and a feeling of confidence and power that slowly grew as I became less and less attached to reality. Then sudden, violent rage. My mom has told me that she was legitimately scared of me sometimes. Scared of _me_, the shy, quiet boy who stayed in and read and stayed calm when others got angry and never got into a fight at school in his life.

As the testosterone high dropped off, the rage would disappear, leaving behind exhaustion and a terrible aching pit. I felt spent. I could barely stand, barely speak, but the tears _just wouldn't come_. Then finally, blissful, awful emptiness, disattachment, mild concern, casualness and agreeability, my brain ten feet above my head. 

I never want to be like that again. But I am so, so afraid of dropping the shell, of losing the security that the rage and dissasociation gave, of falling into horrible vulnerability.

I need to let go but I. 

Just.

Can't.

I hate how difficult I've made it for me to feel my own emotions, but I'm terrified of breaking my internal view of myself as somebody cool and stern.

2018-12-01 14:39:22,a23i6r,23,1,"ok, please bare with me, my typing may go a bit wild because my thoughts are running wild, but here we go:  


I am a 14 year old male, and recently i am starting to think i am trans. I've always been a bit feminine (like i was always extremely sensitive and in-touch with my feelings, or i used to hide and play dress up games or romance games on my phone). But 8 days ago i was at family wedding and saw one of my female cousins (who everyone is saying i look like a male version of if that means anything?) wearing this dress and i thought to myself ""damn, that is nice, i wish i wore something like that"". But then i had to catch myself like ""wait, what? I'm a boy, i don't wear dresses?!' But the thought kept nagging at me all night, and i really liked it.  


So we get home, and i immediately hop on my laptop, pull up discord, and spam my 2 transgender friends (they're both ftm. We'll call them Friend and D. Also Friend is pan and D is ace if that also means anything?) I don't give anything away, but i ask them some questions, and the questions are basically all somewhere along the lines of ""do you do boy stuff a lot, and didn't realise it was boy stuff, like u just thought u were weird"" and then hit them with the big ""before you knew u were trans, did u ever see a boy wearing specific clothing and been like ""jesus i would love to wear that"" and then be like ""wait wot, hol up"". Both of them gave a big fat YES to every questions, so i hit them with the ""I think i might be trans""  


So they've been guiding me a lot recently, explaining how the whole thing works (psychologist, surgery, etc) and have been really good at answering my questions and just helping me understand wtf is going on. Anyways, i have a friend (we'll call him N). N is a 27 year old gaming streamer who lives on the other side of the globe, but i was his first follower that wasn't an irl friend, his first mod that wasn't an irl friend, i do the graphic design side of his stream, and i set up his discord. He sees me as a little brother, and we have a great connection, so since i don't have to see him face to face on a daily basis, N seemed like the perfect person to talk to about this. So i questioned him, and he gave me 2 very good pieces of advice. 1. You are 14, everyone else you know is most likely asking themselves the exact same questions (Am i a boy? A girl? Do i like boys? Girls? Both? Neither? Does this make me weird? Do they know what i'm thinking?), so don't do anything rash, make sure you are sure, and 2. A good way for you to find out would be to go shopping with a girl and just have a browse, try it.  


So i don't have a gf, or any girls that i hang out with outside of school really, so that would be difficult, but i thought ""Hey, i could use the online shops"". So i decided to just pull up 2 shopping websites. Rebel (sports), and Target (Department). Just jackets/jumpers, tops, and bottoms from these to shops made up 33 screenshots (and no screenshots of the same style of clothing e.g. hoodies, jeans, leggings etc). Basically, i love it.   


Every day has been coming with new realisations of stuff i've been doing that i just thought was either normal or me being weird. Things such as fantasising about being female in many scenarios, or using 2 towels, or hugging everyone, tying up my hair, and many more little things that i can't think of at the moment, that can easily be dismissed as not important, but when piling up, and combined with everything else, they don't seem so easy to dismiss.  


And that brings us to me making this post. So here is where we stand:  


**REASONS TO BELIEVE I AM TRANS:**

\- The vast majority of my fantasies are about or involve me being female  
\- I am constantly sneaking looks at women wearing makeup and envying it  
\- I love the female clothing selection so much more than the men's section  
\- I do a lot of minor feminine things by instinct, not by instillment such as many of my masculine actions  
\- I feel like i would be a lot more comfortable being female than male  
\- If i could choose to just magically wake up one day and be female, I would  


**REASONS TO BELIEVE I AM NOT TRANS:**  
\- I am much more comfortable talking to and being friends with boys than girls  
\- If i look in the mirror and see myself, i do not feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, nor do i hate my appearance. I   
  would just be much more comfortable in a girl's body  
\- I act like a male (rough and sporty, swearing a lot, gaming, i love stereotypical male activities)  


I think that sums it up more or less. I've probably missed a few details here and there, but this should be good enough to go by. Thank you for bearing with me, i love you all.

-Hey- good- how are you? 
-Doing alright, just getting ready for finals week, and thinking about what to do during the break before we leave for the cruise. I really want to reconnect with some people that I went to school with, especially the ones in the LGBTQ community, but I don’t know how.
-Just reach out! Say hi. Invite them to coffee or something 
Keep it simple :)
-I also just wanted to thank you and [other sister] for reminding me that I don’t have to be exactly what other people want me to be, and that I shouldn’t make decisions based on what I think will gain other people’s approval. I was able to tell Dad that I wanted to do the normal BS program in pharmacy and take things slower rather than doing the BS/MS program, and I don’t think I could have done that without your help. I’m also learning how to assert myself in other ways, such as how I dress/look, which I know seems minor but even cutting my hair really short in high school and again very recently was something I had to sort of fight with mom about. Even now, I had to be quite firm in telling her I didn’t want to wear a dress on the formal night for the cruise. But for once I’m starting to feel more comfortable in my own skin, and I’m really thankful that you and [other sister] have been there to help me. I love you guys.
-Good for you. We love you too. Anyone who really loves you should not have any contingencies and mom should have 0 say in what the heck you want to do with your hair or wear to formal night (or any time). Being [mom’s name] is already taken, so be [my name]. It sounds WAY better that way 
And also good for you on school. Pursue something that pays the bills but also interests you. Don’t let a fear of disappointing others stop you. Like [other sister] said, they spent a lot for her to be a teacher. They’ll get over it. Dad wasn’t happy about me being a food scientist either, but hey, it’s ok and I make a good living doing it. They’ll move on, and again, they’re already taken so be [my name]. 
Also, [other sister] and I love getting to know [my name]. The [my name] with likes and interests and things that make her unique. Not the mold that mom and dad try to create. The things that make you you are special. Don’t let anybody take that away. 
-Yeah, my resolution for this coming year is to become a more authentic version of myself. I want to try exploring some new hobbies, and hopefully working to get over some of my insecurities. I really want to thank you for introducing me to fitness when I was younger. I really enjoyed going to the gym with you, but I just felt really insecure being surrounded by all these really strong and muscular people and feeling kind of bad about my own body and how comparatively small I was, which was entirely my problem and had nothing to do with you or anyone else at the gym. 
-Yeah, the gym can be a good place but also a tough one. Everybody is built differently and has different natural strengths and weaknesses. We are both on the small side, and sometimes it can be hard even for me to watch how easily some people put on muscle. I think what has helped me a lot is to be process oriented and also to find a hobby that brings me a lot of joy (triathlon), because I enjoy what I’m doing while staying healthy, but don’t worry about what everyone else is doing since it’s for me. Also, remember that that girl with the bigger muscles might be looking at you wishing she was smaller. Everyone feels that way sometimes, but the key is to find joy in the way you are and to take care of the body you’ve been given the best that you can 
-Yeah, I’m just glad I’ve gained enough weight to find clothes that fit my body right. But it’s weird that most of the girls I grew up around wanted to be skinny whereas I wanted to be tall and muscular. I felt really weird about it, and I still do. 
-I know it can sometimes feel weird to want something that isn’t pushed by society, but again, these things make you you. Do your thing! Can’t get much taller unfortunately, but you can find ways to express yourself 
-That’s true. 
Thankfully there are other people I know who are also finding new ways to be themselves which I find really encouraging. Not that I need to go along with what everyone else is doing, but it helps to feel less alone.

2018-12-03 21:49:06,a2tgz1,4,1,"Hi! 

So, I’m an experienced ‘dieteer’ I suppose—high school was a bit of a mess with body image issues (shocker) and I spent the whole four years naziing over what/when/how I ate/exercised, and ended up in a great position with it physically!

The problem is I didn’t realize what my ‘issue’ was, then; and further that getting jacked (slight overstatement) wasn’t actually any help... it just made things 10x worse.

Based on my knowledge of myself and dieting, I COULD get away with eating 750-1,250 calories daily, if I stick with a low-fat high-protein (120+ grams) low carb (&lt;20 grams) diet, and could end up losing the amount of mass I would like by sometime early next year.

I’ve only ever cut by 500-600 calories daily... is this a bad idea, even if I make sure I get the micros/macros I need AND continue staying active?

2018-12-04 12:42:36,a30cau,32,1,"Hi all,

I'm transitioning for 1 year now. Obviously there haven't been any issues coming up with my transition on work. No one said something negative, no one laughed or such things.

But under the hood, there have been enormous changes in how I've been seen.

I am working as a software engineer. And coworkers didn't help me, when I said I need help. Coworkers said things like ""I doesn't want her to work on this topic."". Or when I recognized an error in the software, which was currently written by an coworker, it took me a hard fight of 4 weeks to get heard, and we could talk about that error. 4 weeks ! - the result was, it was an error, and he fixed it easily.

I never had such issues before my transition.

And my supervisor did nothing. He simply did nothing. So the last chance was, to escalate this to HR. So HR spoke to the other coworkers, and they are very, very angry about me. 2 of them wanted to consult a lawyer, cause I insinuate transphobia. I never said this, but I said, that this started the last year, in my opinion.

So today there was an consultation with the supervisor of my supervisor, our head of HR and me. To take a long story short: They want to fire me.

Luckily I live and work in Germany, and they cannot fire me as easy as you can in the US, but they can make my life a hell. And in the end they can fire me, it only takes a little more time.

Obviously there haven\'t been any issues coming up with my transition on work. No one said something negative, no one laughed or such things.\n\nBut under the hood, there have been enormous changes in how I\'ve been seen.\n\nI am working as a software engineer. And coworkers didn\'t help me, when I said I need help. Coworkers said things like ""I doesn\'t want her to work on this topic."". Or when I recognized an error in the software, which was currently written by an coworker, it took me a hard fight of 4 weeks to get heard, and we could talk about that error. 4 weeks ! - the result was, it was an error, and he fixed it easily.\n\nI never had such issues before my transition.\n\nAnd my supervisor did nothing.

Tuning out of starlight
The innocent lifetime flickers and flashes
Onto a canvas
No, nobody seems worth it
And while the feeling's sophisticated
The view is so restrained
The past is nearing closer and closer I fear

So let's just cut the bullshit
And tell me who's independent
Thumbs twiddling and your life's escaping your mind
Keep in mind
Well the air ain't free as it used to be
But that's quite alright when you're still eighteen
It seems to be
And I'll tell you who's overrated
What's a beautiful person with some hideous dreams?
And while the lining isn't silver
We're verging on the side of the road that'll take us home

The edge of us is getting weighed
Read about your life in your local papers
Realize the end of us is getting near
You're just a droplet of paint trickled off your canvas

Delirious illusions flowing backwards through the river of color
While we analyze it to try see it clearer
Secretly appealing to a lonely prisoner
Now what's your vision?

Initiate your shading, blend the universe together in time
It only gets a little easier
Suddenly piece yourself back together now
What's your vision?

And I don't wanna have to give a damn about you
Or your inhibitions
After all, you're the one who taught me love
Was not for everybody
However, I'm starting to see this world in the right light
Yet it still gets darker
You see, it's just a simple symphony
Or a painting
Whatever

This unnatural path
It spans infinitely
But my world is crumbling
Let it collapse into the abyss
In the midst of summer it won't exist
This emptiness
It's just a blank slate
Waiting for a painter to interfere
It's quite complex
But what do I know?.",trans,"This song is so fitting, I think I relate almost too well, I felt it needed to be shared",1543973090.0,"{'created_utc': 1543947890, 'id': 'a33b33', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Canvas by Rezonate\n\nTuning out of starlight\nThe innocent lifetime flickers and flashes\nOnto a canvas\nNo, nobody seems worth it\nAnd while the feeling's sophisticated\nThe view is so restrained\nThe past is nearing closer and closer I fear\n\nSo let's just cut the bullshit\nAnd tell me who's independent\nThumbs twiddling and your life's escaping your mind\nKeep in mind\nWell the air ain't free as it used to be\nBut that's quite alright when you're still eighteen\nIt seems to be\nAnd I'll tell you who's overrated\nWhat's a beautiful person with some hideous dreams?\nAnd while the lining isn't silver\nWe're verging on the side of the road that'll take us home\n\nThe edge of us is getting weighed\nRead about your life in your local papers\nRealize the end of us is getting near\nYou're just a droplet of paint trickled off your canvas\n\nDelirious illusions flowing backwards through the river of color\nWhile we analyze it to try see it clearer\nSecretly appealing to a lonely prisoner\nNow what's your vision?\n\nInitiate your shading, blend the universe together in time\nIt only gets a little easier\nSuddenly piece yourself back together now\nWhat's your vision?\n\nAnd I don't wanna have to give a damn about you\nOr your inhibitions\nAfter all, you're the one who taught me love\nWas not for everybody\nHowever, I'm starting to see this world in the right light\nYet it still gets darker\nYou see, it's just a simple symphony\nOr a painting\nWhatever\n\nThis unnatural path\nIt spans infinitely\nBut my world is crumbling\nLet it collapse into the abyss\nIn the midst of summer it won't exist\nThis emptiness\nIt's just a blank slate\nWaiting for a painter to interfere\nIt's quite complex\nBut what do I know?."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'This song is so fitting, I think I relate almost too well, I felt it needed to be shared', 'created': 1543973090.0}"

2018-12-04 23:30:20,a369j7,4,1,"There is an actual question in this, but I'm going to vent about my childhood a bit first.

So, I'm basically a textbook case of gender dysphoria. Knew from as young as three, had the ""boy stuck in a girl's body"" mentality, strong opposition to traditionally feminine stuff and strong preference for traditionally masculine stuff, etc.. But my question is in regards to the sense of self and personality.

I realized from as young as three that my idea of who I was conflicted with the way others saw me, not just as far as gender, but also personality. I didn't pay it much attention because, well, I was three. I only started to really think about it once I was around nine or ten. It felt like I couldn't be myself around my family the way I could at school around my friends. My family didn't like it when I was a rambunctious, happy, fun-loving little boy. I felt like I had to be completely silent and emotionless around them to live up to their pre-created ideal of me as their ""shy, quiet little girl."" And even if I was myself around them, it didn't feel right to know that they were still seeing me as that girl. Plus, my mom made it very clear to me that she would only love me if I was a girl. The only affection she showed me was super gendered, and although she didn't refuse to buy me boy clothes, she made sure to make me feel guilty about it the whole time.

I was excited for middle school because I was convinced that I would go through male puberty due to having a male brain. I thought that my body would finally catch up with my brain and everything would fall into place; my family would finally learn that I was a boy, I could go to middle school as a boy, I could finally express myself and my personality without hesitation or fear. But of course that didn't happen. Once I learned that it wasn't going to happen and I'd have to go to middle school as a girl, I sort of fell into a depression. I figured, ""I have to grow up and be a girl now,"" but all I knew about being a girl was being silent, not saying anything, not forming opinions or having beliefs. Basically just existing as little as possible. I assumed that that was who I was, because that made the adults happy, and obviously they knew more about everything than I did because they were adults and I was just a kid.

I stayed like that for the rest of middle school and through all of high school as well, though I think I did get a few more aspects of my old personality back once I started living as a guy junior year. But I still feel like I'm not allowed to have a personality or beliefs or anything. I'm trying to go back to being the outgoing, fun-loving little dude I was in fifth grade because that really felt like it was me. But it's really hard. I'm so used to being this emotionless, voiceless person that everyone wanted me to be that it's hard to shake that off of me.

So my question is, does anybody else feel this way? Like they had to abandon their real personality at a certain age just to please the role their family forced them into because of their birth sex? If so, how did you go about finding yourself afterwards? I'm not just talking about gender identity here, as we've obviously all had to hide that before. I mean personality.

So, I am not on hormones yet, but I am partly asian and therefore, I don't really look that masculine. Luckily, this lets me pass (with some help from my dear friend makeup :&gt;)
I am 22 and share a flat with a girl (25) and a dude (25ish). The girl is the only person who knows about me being trans. So, when the dudes not in the city (which happens quite frequently), I am able to dress up and roam around the city. So far so good.. however, as I was getting ready, the girl told me that a friend of hers would come over and she'd be very accepting. 2 minutes later the door bell rang and we greeted each other. She was indeed very lovely! They even lent me a scarf! They also complimented me which boosted my confidence. As I went out, I even bought some groceries and makeup (although the store had some self scanning checkout, so I was able to avoid any contact). After that I went for a short walk and didn't get any weird looks (going out when it's dark definitely helps!). 

After getting home I went back into my room. As I went for a smoke, the other two girls were on the balcony as well, so we talked a bit (haven't mastered my voice which makes me rather anxious when talking in my 'girl voice'). They saw a friend on the streets and invited her. So, there was a new person to meet while being all dressed up. Both times I was very nervous but in hindsight, I am very happy that I got to meet them. It really helped my confidence that there are suuuper supportive people out there. Also the fact that I (unintentionally) pushed my boundaries made me happy (some sort of adrenaline kick haha).

Yep, that was the story. Nothing special but IMO it's the little things and successes that count! :)

When your breasts came in:
How hard were they to hide?
How did you bind them? What did you use?
Were they easy to bind to hide?
Were they soft and squishy? In other words, easy to flatten when pressed against your chest?
I know YMMV, but at what point did yours start bouncing?
At what point did you need to start wearing a bra?
What other body changes did you experience in the first year (and at what month)?
When did your partner start to notice these or any changes?

Basically, i am 99% sure i am trans mtf, but i have some questions because i would rather not be outed by my parents seeing my search history:  
\- What does the thing (HRT, Estrogen, whatever it is) do (boobs, voice, hair?)  
\- What do you need surgery for?  
\- How many surgeries and how long do each last?  
\- What do they do about the penis and balls and how do they give vagina?  
\- How old do you have to be for certain surgeries?  
\- Do you get period, can you become pregnant, etc after getting a vagina  
\- What do they do about, intercourse? like, will you feel anything, can you, umm, y'know... orgasm?  
\- Is it normal to be chill with pronouns before transitioning (before i transition i am cool with people still calling me a boy? does this make me not trans?)

2018-12-08 20:51:38,a4efl1,2,1,"I’m a trans woman, so I’ve been thinking about the masculine habits of inhabiting my body I have.

I’ve been learning to feel comfortable swaying my hips, and standing contrapposto, with my hips slanted one side above the other supporting my weight on one leg.

I’ve started crossing my legs with one knee over the other, and starting to feel embarrassed about unconsciously man spreading my legs.

I’ve started flipping my wrist, touching my hair and my lips when I’m feeling flirtatious and aroused.

When I juggle my soccer ball I feel more comfortable exploring the relationship I have with my ball as I chase it and keep it from the ground. I’m light on my feet and almost dancing, deciding in each split second how slowly or quickly I should attack the ball in a way I can not even predict. If I drop my ball I can freely express my emotions of joy and frustration by spinning or bounding with my body.

My lover even picked me up yesterday, and I held on to her by wrapping my legs around her waist as she spun me around. Right then I was overwhelmed with gender euphoria, and felt so authentic and feminine.

There is even an aspect to masculinity that many men feel uncomfortable being touched, physically comforted and nurtured, but they are comfortable being the ones touching their partners. Imagine a loved one just holding you while stroking your hair or cheek.

I feel a lot more confident speaking up about my feelings, and I don’t care about appearing strong and stoic anymore, I can be silly and that has changed the basic relationship I have when I inhabit my body. 

I have a much larger emotional range I am comfortable feeling inside myself and expressing. Sometimes it feels good to feel weak and helpless till tears start running down my cheeks.

I think most men are afraid of inhabiting their bodies in that way because they are afraid of being seen as gay. It takes a lot of work to actively overcome that fear, and I doubt many men would do that unless they felt they had to, because it is very scaring knowing people see you as something different.

If you want to see how scared you are try painting your fingernails and then go to the supermarket. Very few people would actually care about the slightly effeminate stranger, but I’m sure most of you would be very uncomfortable, I was.

His reasoning is that he finds it disgusting and just doesn't want to be aware that he bleeds. And i get that, even if i personally do not get dysphoric over my period. But i find not showering for a week to be just as disgusting.

So, hi, I'm Lilly! Mtf, obviously.

I just wanted to put my thoughts somewhere to maybe get a few in return. Here we go.

If you ask me, I'm not trans. I'm a woman. That's just it. Although there's that nagging voice in my head trying to question my validity, I have had conversations with girls about ""typical girl things"" and they totally knew what I was talking about, to the point of even blushing when the topics got a bit, erm, _oolala_. I hold onto that, because it proves to me that I don't have to learn how to be a woman because I'm trans, I already am. The more comfortable/happy I feel, the more happens automatically, including movement (move dem hips), gestures, voice modulation and so on.
Being trans is just the term to unite all the different aspects of my position for people who aren't in my shoes, which are a lot of course. Not the shoes, the people I mean. I'm too broke to buy shoes yet.

And sure, I look in the mirror and some boyish lad stares back at me, but in the end that's hopefully temporary. I've got my first contact appointment in about a month. Let's hope I get my tiddyskittles quickly, because considering my body hair growth I'm either very slowly becoming a werewolf who doesn't care about moonphases or the last sorry bits of puberty are trying to finish the job, fss. 

Anyway, for that exact reason I want to go full time stealth except maybe for some close friends that I might make in my new home town. When I've got my hormones and wardrobe sorted out, I'm _done_. Just fucking _done_. Maybe I'm mistaken in saying this, but as soon as I start passing, it'll be irrelevant for people to know I'm trans. Not that it is now, but I can't help people making a doubletake when looking at me right now.

I hear a lot something along the lines of ""I can't do this now, I've got too much at stake in career and this and that"" Well, I haven't got a career and I desperately need to start getting a job so I can stay with my girlfriend and combat my depression, but I'd rather jump into the fire and flame on than sit everything out and keep decaying. Other problems be damned, I'm taking them on all at once!

I think I'm done here. Hope I didn't offend or destroy someone's morale with the last bit, but I had to put it out there somewhere just to have said it once.
So yea, if you're sure about who you are and you're hesitant to transition, then I'd say: Just do it. You deserve and owe it to yourself. I stalled an entire year and I fucking hate that I did; I could have had so much hormonal progress in that one year. Instead I tucked it away and dissociated until I nearly fell apart completely.
So yea do it, in a safe way, as best as you can.
Go gettit!

I'm obviously aware of what Estrodial will do, and I'm also aware of finasteride and it's effects as I take it already for hair loss. I'm essentially trying to have all my information correct so that when my parents start trying to talk down to me about ""the dangers and permanency of HRT"" that I can assure them that I know what I'm doing and aware of what will happen/take place in my body, as well as mental state.   


I know that results may vary depending on person to person so I want to make sure that there is some kind of standard or base standard that I can use when trying to talk to them about this, so that I don't seem to them like a confused child.   


Effects that I'm hoping to look more into are:  


Slowing down baldness/thickening of hair  
Better fat distribution in hips and breast area   
Thinning and slowing down growth of body hair  
Facial fat changing/reshaping (however you refer to it as)  


Sorry if my question or request doesn't fit the rules of the subreddit, but I just want help in getting my point across, as well as find a way to do some research that I can take back to my mentor, who is helping me plan a way to get this across to my parents that this is what I want and need to be happy, and that this is most certainly not a phase of my existence.   


Thanks!

For background, I live with my fiancée, my mom, and recently my father moved in with us. 
Its a good arrangement so far, as I'm currently unable to work due to medical issues and my fiancee and I are expecting our first baby in February.
My dad seems to be trying but also seems to still (after nearly nine years of living full time as male) be hoping its a phase.
With him, he brought a few ornaments from when I was a kid. I didn't say anything about it when he found one that was a picture of my older brother and I at like, 2 &amp;4 years old, because we lost all our photos of when I was a kid in a house fire and I knew how much it meant to my mom.
But now hes found a few little heart ornaments. One with my brother's name, one with his name, and one with my dead name (and its also misspelled so I don't know whats up with that)
I am really uncomfortable with the idea of that going on the tree. I dont want to offend him or anything, but it's a huge source of dysphoria for me and its stressing me out.

2018-12-12 03:21:11,a5e90u,6,1,"So where to start. All through out high school I considered myself a straight guy. I never experienced any physical attraction towards other men and only ever dated cis women. But last year my junior year of high school I met this absolutely beautiful stunning trans man who I immediately hit it off with we were friends for about 3 or 4 months until we finally got together and have been for 9 months now. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life and i love this man with my entire heart. These past 9 months have been the most amazing of my life I’ve never felt such intense love until i met him and I truly think he is the love of my life. 

Recently I’ve been feeling very anxious, nervous and all around like a shitty person. The reason being that with the end of our high school career rapidly approaching and college being in the very near future. The possibility for him to begin transitioning is finally feasible. I haven’t spoken to him about wether he wants to transition or not because I’m afraid of saying the wrong thing. But I’ve been recently tearing myself up over wether I would still be attracted to him physically if he begins to transition. Like I mentioned I’ve always identified as straight and never felt attraction to cis men. I even recently have tried watching gay porn to see if anything happens arousal wise and unfortunately nothing happens. 

So I guess my questions are is it wrong of me to lose physical attraction to him if he transitions? Is it wrong of me to be dating him in the first place if I can’t seem to be physically attracted to the “traditional masculine body”? Should I talk to him about this? I’m just so afraid of losing him because I really do love him more than anything in this world and I would be devastated if I lost him. But at the same time I don’t want to not be able to provide for his needs if he transitions and am afraid this means this relationship can’t last.

I of course called him that same night to talk, but I feel like I should have done more. I wasn’t expecting a call like this the next day. I was going to see him next week and talk more. 

My brother is unhappy with his body. He wants to transition over night and everyone has told him it doesn’t work that way. He hates his boobs. I’m so glad there’s more trans awareness, but I feel like social media just shows the before and after. He’s not realizing people have been transitioning for years! I don’t know how to get this across. 

Thankfully he’s okay. I saw him today and reminded him how much I love him. This is all new to me so I slip with pronouns and still refer to him as her with my bf and other family.

And then she calls me to talk ot through and she was like i always thought you were bisexual didn't know you were into men........

Then called me sis but then continued everything else with male pronouns (even worse my native language is super gendered)

Then i was like yo girl im into women and she was like but how can you be trans and into women.....

Asked me how long I've known and i was like a few years but denied it and she was like WOAH THAT WAS BEFORE TRANS PEOPLE WERE FASHIONABLE


And then even though i told her to keep a secret, a secret secret she decided to YELL AT A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE THROUGH THE PHONE that her brother is now her sister.


And like at this point i got really really mad i mean mild transphobia is expected of uneducated peeps BUT in no fucking way does she have the authority to come out for me. And i told her that. That's overstepping my boundaries that's part of my personal space and has to do only with me, and i told her to keep a secret.

Anyway i told her she's acting like a piece of shit and i regret telling her im trans. I know, harsh, but i got really really mad at this

I would love to hear a little about how your journey has been so far to get to here.

Me:

I'm a odd kind of guy that never really fit in to most norms.
About 10 years ago I found out that I did have a bi curious side to me that I needed to figure out. I had a few meetings with men over the years and it was a slow journey for me.
The last couple of years I have journeyed a bit further I to this whole thing. I am bisexual but to my great great surprise I am also quite fond of the feminine.
Basically I was called a gender when younger and never really understood it. Now I get it. I'm a man but I don't fit into the manly man mold in any way.
I wanted to try on a pair of thongs a few months ago. Oh boy. I shouldn't have. It was as if it talked to my soul in some way. As if something hidden or withheld all of a sudden emerged.

It just felt so comforting and satisfying. Not even in a sexual way. Something just clicked.

I am still only at a place where I only have a few pieces of underwear but every day I can't wait to wear it. I have a wife and 3 kids that I still live with for now (we are separated and waiting to move).

Yesterday I bought some everyday hipsters that's very comfortable and a bra. I figure those panties will start to be worn every day.

My wife or rather my gf (which we are now instead of man and wife) knows little about it. She knows I'm bi and am with men from time to time.
She also found me with laced panties one night (I let her find me really), and she found it prettttty odd. I'm sure she found my stash of nylons and panties. Not yet seen the bra 😂. 

For me I can't wait to proceed further into this whole crossdressing. I want to get my nails done, do more hair removal, buy clothes shoes, try makeup on. I want to see a full transformation of myself. 
I have a feeling when I move into my own flat I will have some fun!

2018-12-19 00:12:35,a7gyvt,9,1,"Hey all, 

I'm a girl in a girls body, growing up I was a massive tomboy etc. I remember when I was 12 being outside the girls changing rooms in line for p.e. with the boys while we waited for the girls to hurry up, and I turned round to my friends and said I think I'm a boy for being ready so quick haha, while having that first question to myself of ""am I actually a boy with girl parts"", this was a thought I had before I even know anything about transgender. I always picked boys to play in video games, in kiss chase I always wanted to be the kisser rather than the kissee because I thought it was too girly, I was always king because I don't like being called queen and I never wanted to be the mum when playing families.

Fast forward through high school I was still one of the lads, everyone assumed I had no boobs because I wore baggy clothes and just had no interest to show my body off, if anything I was embarrassed of it. I always put myself down because of it. I didn't really question myself in high school as I was comfortable with my friends, but ""girly"" things would make me freak out, I only ever went bra shopping once and it caused me to have a meltdown in the shop. I was 15😂

Then college came, still happy being myself, college was chill and everyone was more open/accepting/not bothered about what anyone was. I met my now boyfriend and we've been together for almost 4 years. He has always told me how beautiful I am and how much he loves my body and I shouldn't be ashamed of it since day 1, he still does it and is always trying to help me see that I am. 

But the problem is, I don't feel it. Over the past year or so my gender has been popping up in my mind every now and then, especially as I start to think about myself getting older and what I kinda see for myself. For example I'm terrified of giving birth and I don't like the idea of being pregnant, it's too ""gross"" to me, so I always say I don't want kids, when in reality I do, I love kids, I just don't want one from being a girl nor does the idea of being called mum appealing to me. 
Anyway these past few weeks these feelings have been a lot more present in my head, I don't know if it's been influenced by People on YouTube, the media etc but they are there and some things they say I relate to. Admittedly there are very rare times I feel confident in my body, but even then I can't refer to my boobs as boobs, they are things. My down there is worse, I literally call it my down there. The thing that triggers me the most is bras, once I've got one I'm like going to wear that every day for fucking ages, until it rips and falls apart, I had never shopped for my own, my mum always dealt with it for me and handed me the plainest ones she found. What really got to me was that my bf brought me a bra, but it was the wrong size... So we went to exchange it and I ended up going in the measuring room, and my god I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life with myself. Honestly I was shaking, back to mirror constantly and to the lady measuring she was so helpful and sweet bless her but I probably came across like right weirdo! Once that whole ordeal was over I freaked out and it put me on edge, I had a proper breakdown once I was alone and I just cried confused at everything. 

I don't know. Just the idea of me maybe not being a girl is scary. I still can't stand being called a lady, or woman or mum (to my pet). I am really uncomfortable with my body about 96% of the time. I just try not to think about any of it and tell myself it's me being silly or I'm just having a blip with my head and stuff. The more I think about it the more it starts to make sense, but it might be cos I'm thinking about it so much that I'm tricking myself into thinking I'm a boy?! Or what if it's just I really have no body confidence?? It's such a big thing to think about and it scares the shit out of me, these thoughts could just be temporary but what if they're not? Like I'm scared of how I'd go about it, how it would effect my relationship and how my family would react (I know how they each would already though)

It's just a scary thing and sorry I think I needed to type and release this to someone. Thanks for reading, if you have any advice for my confused self then I'm all ears! 

Oh and just a note, I spoke to my bf about it after my major bra store freakout, he was really supportive and was absolutely devastatingly sorry over how I felt, he felt like it was his fault when it really wasn't.

2018-12-19 08:51:14,a7kplp,1,1,"Okay so I apologize if I offend anyone with anything I say because ill admit I don't know much about this sort of stuff. Also I'm not even sure this is the right sub for this so I also apologize if it's not.

A little bit of background, my baby brother is 17 and I am a 25 y/ o female. 

We have been playing lots of online video games together recently and have gotten much closer in the last few months. (We live across the country from each other.)

He's painfully shy around people he doesn't know well and he had terrible anxiety in school so he is now homeschooled. He doesn't open up to many people but he seems to be starting to open up to me. 

I love him no matter what, whether he wants to be my sister or brother, and I want him to know that but I also don't want to upset him if I'm completely off the mark.

My mom told me that a few months ago she went school shopping for him and came home with about 100 dollars worth of stuff (she doesn't have much money, so to them that is quite a bit) which was some things like jeans and t shirts and boxers. He wanted to take all of it back and find something else, which at the time hurt her feelings but he went with her to the store, which is actually a big feat for him because he rarely leaves the house and bought a coat out of the women's section. He LOVES that coat a lot, enough to where he was so proud of it he sent me a picture of himself wearing it which he never does. And it's a super cute coat too. 

He watches tons of anime and not long ago he started sending me pictures of girls that are called traps, which I didn't at the time know what they were so he explained them to me. I didn't know at the time what his fascination with them was and I don't still I guess, but he talks about weird stuff off and on so I didn't really question it that much. Basically he played a game where he sent me pictures of traps and wanted me to guess whether they were girl or guy. 

Most recently he ended up buying for himself a cosplay of a certain female anime character and he is super excited for it. And he just bought it for himself, no other rhyme or reason. He told me he'd send me a picture when he gets it, which he hasn't yet.

And maybe I'm just completely wrong here, or maybe he just has an interest in women's fashion, I truly don't know.

I guess what I'm asking here is, how do I approach the fact that I will love him no matter who or what he wants to be without possibly upsetting him or alienating him? I just want him to know he is accepted and loved. I know my mom feels the same way but also doesn't know how to approach him on the subject. Or should I just let him be and let him decide if he wants to talk to me about anything? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you

2018-12-19 09:00:21,a7krcz,3,1,Long story short I’m ftm. I have been a boy my whole life. I came out as gay to my family at 15/16 and it was a whole ordeal. My oldest sister is also gay. It was a lot for my family to accept and they have and are great about it. It is so normal in my family now. But I’m on the brink of my 21st birthday and I know I’m trans. Felt this way my whole life and was resurfaced to me when I was 18. My whole life is my family and I know if I transition nothing will be the same again.

other trans girls talk about how much they hated the bland blues and grays of male fashion, always wearing a t-shirt, hoodie and jeans. but i think i _like_ that? or do i? maybe it's just because i repressed my desire for girl clothes? and they also talk about having so much more emotional freedom as a girl than as a guy, but that scares me, and i can't tell if it's because i actually _am_ unemotional and nonsocial, or if it's because ive used it as a coping mechanism for so long, and does that even effect whether im a girl or not?

2018-12-22 01:30:43,a8gkjn,1,1,"Question- What is the biggest issue in your opinion in civilised society?
My Answer- I believe the biggest issue that today's society faces is the misunderstanding of mental illnesses that cause people to damage their physical body. The problem with this issue is that it is socially acceptable, and if people stand against the current ideas of this issue you can be labelled, offensive and socially unaware. The issue I am referring to is the way humanity deals with people with problems identifying their gender and therefore damaging their physical persona. In present times the 'cure' to people that are diagnosed with gender dysphoria is surgery to change their genitalia and modify their hormones. These procedures are near irreversible and can be highly damaging and have great risk involved, and people can come out of this 'cure' feeling more dissatisfied about the body that they were before, and they would become mentally unstable and this could lead to even greater issues like suicide, or self-harm. My ideas toward this problem is that this health condition should be acknowledged as a mental illness, the reason I believe is if for example if you have a mental illness that makes you want to commit self-harm on yourself, professionals would send them to a psychologist, to protect yourself to damage to your own body. Now if we apply this to gender dysphoria, if you think you are a different gender and want to damage your body by giving yourself hormones and having dangerous surgery on your genitalia, surely the doctors would send you to a psychologist, this is like letting a person cut themselves because it's what they want. We are teaching people who believe they are transsexual that they have to change their body in order to feel right, however why don't we teach them that they have to change their brain in order to feel right in their body, sure this takes more time and requires the diagnosed to help themselves, but its reduces their physical risk. A statistic I found is the percentage of transsexuals that have reportedly attempted suicide, this is just under 50%, which absolutely horrific, even after the operation the statistic stays constant, so with psychotherapy we could aim to reduce this. My final point is that what if the patient turns out not to have gender dysphoria, only they are going through a temporary phase of gender confusion, and after a year, or shorter they decide they made a mistake and want to go back to being cisgendered. This would be very difficult to perform in a surgery and would put the patients in even more danger and risk, not to mention this would cost the NHS thousands per patient, which could be significantly lower than if these people undergo psychotherapy. I also just want to say I wrote this not to offend and discriminate against people dealing with this illness, only to present different ideas regarding this topic, they may be right or wrong it is only my personal opinion, and that is what the question asked me for.

Now if we apply this to gender dysphoria, if you think you are a different gender and want to damage your body by giving yourself hormones and having dangerous surgery on your genitalia, surely the doctors would send you to a psychologist, this is like letting a person cut themselves because it's what they want. We are teaching people who believe they are transsexual that they have to change their body in order to feel right, however why don't we teach them that they have to change their brain in order to feel right in their body, sure this takes more time and requires the diagnosed to help themselves, but its reduces their physical risk. A statistic I found is the percentage of transsexuals that have reportedly attempted suicide, this is just under 50%, which absolutely horrific, even after the operation the statistic stays constant, so with psychotherapy we could aim to reduce this. My final point is that what if the patient turns out not to have gender dysphoria, only they are going through a temporary phase of gender confusion, and after a year, or shorter they decide they made a mistake and want to go back to being cisgendered. This would be very difficult to perform in a surgery and would put the patients in even more danger and risk, not to mention this would cost the NHS thousands per patient, which could be significantly lower than if these people undergo psychotherapy. I also just want to say I wrote this not to offend and discriminate against people dealing with this illness, only to present different ideas regarding this topic, they may be right or wrong it is only my personal opinion, and that is what the question asked me for.\n\xa0"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My Trans Essays', 'created': 1545467443.0}"

2018-12-23 05:07:04,a8s2nb,6,1,"so obviously i can’t rely on others for huge shit like this but i need advice. i have no clue if i have gender dysphoria or not because i’m generally a very uncertain and indecisive person. 
so here goes a bunch of experiences i’ve had that i need help deciphering. 

- when i was younger, a kid at my school came out as trans (ftm). i went out of my way to cover up his birthname on his locker with his name. i always really wanted to be friends with him even though he was a pretty shitty person. i talked about him way too much and got extremely upset the one time he was mad at me. 
- in middle school once i started dressing myself i mostly wore jeans/leggings graphic tees, never anything feminine
- i have one clear memory from 4th or 5th grade when i put my hair into a hat at a fair and wanted people to mistake me for a boy
- in 6th grade i asked a kid in my class to be an “honorary boy” 
- always cared about being accepted by boys i knew, even today 
- when i got my period, i was extremely upset and in denial instead of being excited to become a woman 
- in middle, i followed a bunch of trans guys on instagram and knew way too much about hormones and surgeries and binding, etc 
- in middle + early highschool, i wore the same sports bra every day
- when my mom tried to take me bra shopping a few months ago i refused to go into the store, freaked out (even though subconsciously i knew there was nothing to freak out about) and almost cried
- freshman + sophomore year especially i had horrible social anxiety and found myself going home early from school and isolating myself, and i always felt like everyone was staring and laughing at me
- i still can’t picture myself as an adult or even out of high school. i feel like i don’t have a future and i’m reading my life off a script 
- i was really jealous last month when my friend told me he was going on testosterone
- i hate being called girl or she especially in public by strangers. i feel disappointed they didn’t see me as anything else
- someone called me “it” a few weeks ago. she’s in three of my classes and i still feel sick when i look at her 
- despite having been extremely politically active (especially for feminism) in the past i feel myself straying from that. i don’t have as strong emotions about issues in the media and i don’t even attend my school’s feminist club anymore 
- sometimes i feel trapped in my body, like when i’m in public wearing a tighter shirt 
- some days more than others, i find myself wanting traditionally male childhood experiences, like playing baseball or playing video games with male friends 
- right now everyone sees me as a lesbian, but i cant picture myself as an older lesbian or even an adult. 
- sometimes i feel homesick or nostalgic for experiences that aren’t mine? that’s the best way i can describe it

my problem is that sometimes i say or do feminine things that make me doubt myself. one big one has been crossing my legs. i don’t know any straight dudes who cross their legs. i could be bisexual but i think i confuse attraction for jealousy with guys sometimes? i’m really just stuck in a spiral of confusion. 

i need advice please! does anyone have similar experiences??

2018-12-23 05:40:39,a8s9zo,1,1,"Hi all,

I'm wondering if you can help me with a little conundrum I have...

So I was born with a male body, I'm early 30s, and am exploring my gender identity as I'm really not certain what it is at this point. I'm thinking/daydreaming about what it would be like to live as a female pretty much a large portion of every day, so this is something I need to explore. I've created a list of all the possible things that could mean I identify as female. I'd like to find out if I'm exaggerating or obsessive, as I really have no frame of reference to judge that by. If you could have a look and give me your feedback, it'd be much appreciated!

(And yes, I realise the irony of having a female-name avatar, don't let that sway you!)

Here's a list of all traits/notes from as far back as I can remember...

Age 4 - 9
- Liked long hair
- Looked feminine, mistaken for girl
- Friends mostly girls
- Connected to girls better, both peers and adults/teachers, enjoyed hanging out with them more
- developed extreme pelvic floor tension that lasted well into adulthood (possibly related to a dislike of my male genitals? I have no recollection).

Age 9-11
- Fantasised about sex as a girl
- Would experiment dressing up in female clothes
- Disliked traditionally masculine clothes
- Felt uncomfortable going through puberty
- Hid the fact that my voice broke from my parents for months, really wanted to keep my high voice (yep, I went through puberty young).
- Sat down on the toilet to pee...

Age 11-13
- Pretended to be a girl in online chat rooms regularly
- Didn't like stubble growing

Age 13-18
- Occasionally tried wearing makeup
- Favoured female teachers, didn't connect to male ones
- Occasional to frequent dysphoria when looking in mirror or at photos, ongoing through adulthood, mainly about facial bone structure

Age 18+
- Tried wearing makeup on numerous occassions
- Love and connect way way more to literature and film/tv where a female is the protagonist instead of a man

Age 25+
- Used almost exclusively female avatars in all video games
- I don't relate to the stereotypical adult masculine traits, interests, or ways of life much at all.
- Used female avatars on social media before changing to neutral after starting a company, as public profiles became high visibility
- Some people think I'm female before knowing my birth gender when speaking online, they say based on how I communicate.
- I discovered, read, and became obsessed with all the twilight books in a week flat (before realising they obviously set a terrible example for young people and renouncing my 'fandom').
- Love lgbt and gender-exploratory programs like steven universe, especially relating to certain genderfluid and female characters
- love body-swap film/anime
- Continuous strong desire (or longing) to experiment dressing and acting like a woman - to the extent of watching tons of trans stories/videos, making trans female shopping lists, and learning and 'imaginary planning' if I were to undergo the process of transition in great detail
- Whenever I close my eyes and imagine my body as female, I feel a surge of relaxation and warmth, and my mind goes calm and tranquil
- When fantasising/daydreaming about 'magical/fantasy/sci-fi futures and scenarios', I'm.exclusively female in those fantasies

Other random notes that may (or may not) be useful:
- I prioritise emotional connection and empathy above all else in a relationship and friendships
- I've just experimented with waxing my chest/abs, and it feels goddamn fantastic. To clarify my sexuality here, I believe I'm pansexual, leaning strongly towards attraction to females.
- I've had some trauma as a child (nothing physical)
- I've had mental health issues most of my life, including strong anxiety, ocd, depression, (95% healed after years of work now. Never give up folks. Woop!)
- I don't have extreme gender dysphoria, but then again I don't have a strong connection to my body at all, especially with the aformentioned pelvic floor tension (working on it!)
- For those that know or care about mbti - and this is probably irrelevant - I'm INFJ.
- I don't hate my body, I just don't connect to it well.
- There's a lot about being a man that's enjoyable, but something just doesn't feel complete.
- I'm a 'problem solver' when trying to help people, so sometimes I come across as less empathetic (or stereotypically 'female') than I feel. I just value helping people in conjunction with listening, as opposed to just listening and doing nothing. Life's precious, and I believe problems should be solved and not left to stagnate.
- I find it hard to understand my true gender as I see myself as different from most of both genders. Society's full of toxic masculinity and femininity, so finding 'balanced' people to view as archetypes of their gender (or even understanding what that looks like) is a little challenging.
- People I relate to in fiction (I'm scraping the barrel, but the more info to help you help me, the better): Sabrina Spellman, Daenerys, Jon Snow, Mitsuha (the Your Name girl), Neo (yes, I know the trans allegory).



So... penny for your thoughts?
I'm only looking for opinions here as I'm just at the stage of consciously exploring my gender identity, I have no firm beliefs or plans or ideas, but I feel it's important to speak about this and get feedback from others who may be able to help piece things together.

Thanks in advance!

2018-12-23 18:59:20,a8x9ml,0,1,"Hello. Hope the day finds you well.

I've had several traumatic experiences with men along with a general lack of attraction to men and a strong attraction to women that leads me to believe I'm a lesbian. I use this identity and it feels right to me after a while of thinking I was bi or using these specialized labels to try and describe my complicated relationship with men. I've come to terms with being a lesbian quite recently after realizing that I'd never be with a man with a full peace of mind.

That being said I'm definitely attracted to penises. I hope this won't stir debate and I hope you all can respect how I identify. To me having a penis doesn't exactly mean being a man. I may have been raised with values like that but I've come to understand that gender is more complicated than ""Man Penis Woman Vagina"". I'm admittedly a very sexual person, probably another affect of the trauma I've endured, so satisfaction is very important to me.

Logically - simply in describing the feelings I experience - a pre-op trans woman would be ideal for me. I don't experience any lack of attraction to vaginas and I actually do enjoy sex with cis women. I just...really like dicks. Of course you have the whole strapon/dildo thing but somehow it wouldn't be the same.

I'm not here to debate the validity of my sexuality once again so please do not remark on that. This is nothing more than a physical thing. 

My question is: is the way I feel disrespectful to trans women? I don't want to be seen as a chaser. Admittedly back when Tumblr wasn't banning nsfw shit I was seeking trans women on Tumblr to speak to and occasionally sext with to fulfill myself.

I don't think I see trans women as sexual objects. If I do end up with a trans girl it won't merely be because she has a penis it'll be because I love her, but I'll be sexually satisfied as well. This doesn't mean that this is the end all be all for my relationships, it's just a preference. However I won't try and justify myself too much, as I'm open to criticism and I realise that me being cis does make my opinion on what is/isn't transphobic a little less valuable. 

Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading, if you made it. I hope I can get some insight from some of the trans folks (women in particular) on here.

I even came out to my nan, who is pretty oldschool, and I really didn't expect it to go well. I was fully under the impression that she would never speak to me again, but as we're so close, I bit the bullet. She came down to see me in uni, we went out for food and talked. She even does her best to call me Ryan and he/him and will apologise if she forgets, which is so sweet because I'm well aware that it takes time. Once we discussed how much I've been hurting and how bad I feel in my body, she instantly understood and said she wants to do anything she can to make sure I'm happy. I cried when she introduced me one of her friends as her grandson. I don't know what I would do without her, honestly.

Also my housemates at uni have been great, there's even another trans guy in my house who's had a bit more experience so he's always there to talk if I need to and that helps a bunch. The rest of the house have to so accommodating and make me feel so right and good about myself.

My parents are the complete opposite, though. I came out to my mum on 3 separate occasions and she won't even acknowledge it, and neither will my dad. I'm also not really close enough with my siblings to discuss it with them but I know they'd be cool with it. I know it can be harder for parents than anyone, but the contract between the people who have been so supportive and helpful, and my parents, makes it all the more hard to swallow. As they haven't acknowledged it at all, it feels like they're never going to begin the process of thinking it over, as they just consistently deny it and change the subject whenever I try to talk. One thing my mum did say is that she will never be a part of any of it, and that no matter what she will always call me by my birth name. I'm hoping that isn't true and she does eventually come to terms with it, but it's a daunting idea nonetheless. She also will tell me that I'm ruining her life and that she just wishes I could be normal, which makes me feel super guilty for just existing. Having had her tell me that all my life, it feels like being trans is just added disappointed to her. 

I also have extremely bad anxiety, and so the idea of having to go alone to appointments and things related to something so big, is going to be hard. I have a doctor's appointment in the new year to discuss it and I won't lie I'm absolutely terrified. Someone without anxiety would probably even be scared, but I actually get heart palpitations and struggle to breathe just from thinking about it. I'm kind of scared that I won't be able to start off the medical side of my transition if I struggle to even go to the doctors to discuss being put on a long ass 2+ year waiting list. It almost feels like I'm never going to get anywhere and should just give up and be unhappy, save myself the disappointment later on down the line.

Having been at uni and living with people who have made me feel so comfortable and made me feel like a man, and then coming home to parents that refuse to even acknowledge my being trans, and will joke when calling me she/her and my birth name, is really taking it out of me. I feel so much more depressed since I came home, and have barely even been getting out of bed because of it. I know I can't expect them to accept it this early on, so the only thing that stops me from wanting to slice my throat is to just stay in my room away from all of it. 

Is there anything that I can do? You know to make myself feel better, more valid, more masculine? Because I am really missing that confident feeling I was having, and now I just feel so feminine and.. exposed.

Howdy.

This is a stressful time for all.

Whether you're alone or surrounded by people who think you're straight, refuse to accept you as gay, non-binary, pan, trans and so on, being alone and/or lonely can be really difficult if you haven't voiced your concerns and feelings.

2018-12-25 06:53:27,a9cv3f,7,1,"So I have two issues. 

1) Picking a name
   I've known I'm trans for nearly half my life now, the closest I've come to a name I'd be comfortable living with was a name my mom told me I would've been given had I been born female, I've always gravitated towards it since I found out although I was talking to one of my closest friends who I've recently came out to and he said the name didn't sound too fitting for me and that I should explore different names before committing to one. I think that's a great point and even though I have tried different names in the past it was at a time where I was still thinking about not transitioning altogether, which I do now and for the past year or so. My current name starts with an A as well as my middle name starting with a M, my family has always made it a huge thing that we share initials so finding something fitting with those initials has been hard. I just want to find something that I'd be comfortable with. 

2) Clothing
   Today I received many hyper-masculine clothing pieces to no surprise. I'm not out to my family but I don't know what I was expecting. Although even if its very masculine it has potential to look feminine should I do the right things, I was wondering if anyone knew how to make male clothing look feminine, like long button up flannals and such.

According to transgender issue, of course we're transitioning and prefer the pronoun we want to match on ourselves, that really annoys me a bit about when I'm living as a transgender woman but still have all bank account name as ""MR."" in every financial business I do/have. At least why don't they just delete all sex that appeared on our bank account name instead of forcing us to use it. 

My questions to discuss, are
1. Is it necessary?
2. Any country has this issues too? / How do you feel/experience?
3. Is it better to remove all gender or sex on bank account name? What's the effect / benefits / disadvantage?

So, I got a job at a hotel and have been there for 7 months with no issues. I just work at the front desk as a receptionist. A month ago a coworker found my wallet. She looked at the ID to find out who's it was. I haven't changed my name or gender marker yet. She told me not to worry. She said she is a trans ally and that is none of her business. I went back through her public Facebook and saw lots of pro LGBT posts. A few weeks later the company hired a guy to work front desk. On our first day working together he was anxious to tell me something. He told me that when he had worked with her, she had told him that ""I used to be a man."" All he had said before this was that he thought I seemed like a nice person. I was stupid and tried to explain the situation to him. He didn't even believer her... so I outed myself. I told him that fake people like her are part of why I'm looking for another job. So two weeks pass... My best friend who has no clue I'm trans is reluctant to tell me something... I already knew exactly what she was going to say. ""There is a rumor that you're leaving because someone found out you're actually a man. Of course, I knew immediately that's not true.""

2018-12-28 01:13:00,aa5e2b,2,1,"Hi folks,

I've sort of realized that I've basically not done any to care for myself, maybe ever. I have a chronic, physical and mental illness on top of being trans and a disability. sometimes I wonder if people think I'm just a ""basket case"" who somehow fakes being all these things for points. Also sometimes I wonder if I pissed someone off in a past life or something. 

Anyway I was supposed to have the top surgery I've been needing all my life next month. But I could not drop to the weight the surgeon wanted in time. So that sucks.

Also I'm out to and temporarily living with immediate family, who call me her, she and a woman. I've just kind of given up on correcting it because it's exhausting. My mom tried to get it but was like ""ooh you want to be one of those women who pretend to be men"". She still thinks that way I guess.

I dunno how to life right now, I haven't been in touch with friends for over a month. I've been so low. And my doctor took me off T ""until my surgery"" but basically I think she's bought into terfy health scare stuff.

Sorry this is long and rambling but I just needed to spill my guts somewhere and ask for help and hope. If someone could share their positive outlooks, or find one in my story im overlooking, or just help me snap out of it, id be endlessly grateful. All the best

2018-12-28 01:57:47,aa5qv7,2,1,"Right, so I've been suffering with what I believe is almost \*definitely\* gender dysphoria for around a year and a half or so, but only realised it is probably that and the overwhelming severity of it fairly recently, as soon as a few months ago. I know I have memories that actually alluded to this in my childhood, such as wanting to do girly things, disliking boy-like things, etc and the changes I'm going through right now in my later stages of puberty are making me sick to the stomach because they're masculine changes. I hate it. I want my physical masculinity aesthetically gone now.

The issue here is that I'm pretty certain my family won't be very accepting of this, or might not even understand and this potential disapproval might hinder me from getting any sort of help, and on top of that my girlfriend will probably have to leave me due to her sexuality as she has mentioned to me before when I have brought this topic up.

As with most people, my biggest worry is that I won't come out of the transition feeling as if my body is that of a female and that I won't be able to shape myself up to be the ideal self I've always wanted to be.

For the record, I'm 17 and from the UK. Whilst I can legally just go see my GP myself, I'm not exactly free from the whole parental jazz just yet. Plus I've never actually gone to see my GP myself and I've never really been to my GP in a loooooooong time (we're literally talking years here, I don't even know who my GP is).

My main question really is how should I go about starting the long, looooong transition process, right from the first GP appointment? I would ask if it's worth me even doing this but at this point I can't take it anymore, it's really painful. I attached a picture of myself just in case anyone wants to see what I look like as a male, and judge whether I can eventually look like the gender I feel like I should've been born as (obviously with lots of exercise and actually good sleep along with the therapy and what not because fuuuuuuuuuck me I don't like how fat I am either and my eyebags are horrific).

I do my best to try and change his mind, but I have some trouble tackling some of his arguments. 

This is one of the arguments I don't have a good answer for: he said that trans people don't accept reality. I said they're not accepting a social construct of the gender binary being framed as an objective/biological truth. My friend rebutted that, if a trans person wants to get sex reassignment surgery, then it means that it's their sex that they want to change and not their gender. I couldn't think of a good response to that. 

His overall point seems to be: if gender is just a social construct, then why do trans people want to change their physical genitalia instead of only their gender presentation?

In retrospect, a good rebuttal might have been to say that trans people who want surgery want it because the genitalia they have is a part of their gender presentation that is important to them. I guess I don't know if that's actually why trans people want the surgery, though. 

Anyway, can anyone share any good articles or videos or information that could help me argue against the aforementioned argument, against the ""biological sex is a binary"" argument, and against the ""why is transgender valid but transracial is not"" argument?

2018-12-29 20:31:20,aaoozs,6,1,"Being brought up in a heavily Catholic household, I had a lot of repression about gender that all came flooding back to me when I finally got euphoria for the first time.

This is mostly just for self confirmation/Getting it all down in one place.

So let's get to it, chronologically.

• Had very girly tendencies in my first few years of elementary, quickly learned to stop because of the way people responded (The hardest of these was raising one of my back legs anytime I hugged my ""girlfriend"").

• Was much better at being friends with girls mid-elementary all the way through Jr. High. Again faded out due to the oddness of it.

• Wanted my hair to be long. Longer. Father would always make me cut it short.

• Came out as Bi in Jr High, would feel amazing to swoon at boys with the two girls in my percussion section. Thought it was just sexuality confirmation.

• Became extremely jealous of girls hair and clothing. Thought every male just felt this way.

• Played the points game almost every night I could on Omegle. A really gross game that made me feel femenine, shrugged this off as my sexuality as well.

• Was gender non-conforming for a good part of the beginning of high school. Wore this unicorn hoodie religiously until I decided I needed to fit in better.

• Took thousands of shirtless selfies at a super upward angle because of the curves of my tummy, again decide it's just my gayness.

• Puberty starts. Weird feelings when looking in the mirror commence, also feel that this is normal and everyone has this.

• Self care totally non existent.

• Hated shopping for my own clothes. Loved it when my Mom asked my opinion on clothes she wanted to buy.

• Dressed the same from Jr. High all the way to end of High School. Never mixed it up, why would I it all sucks anyway?

• Basically feel that the female sex is better in every way and daydream about being born a girl.

• As I lose my femanine figure become jealous of females bodies. Think every male feels this way.

• Begin envisioning myself as the female in any type of explicit content I watch.

• Junior year begin disassociating for full days at least a few times a week. Didn't know what to make of this but didn't mind it either?

• Also begin crying endlessly after work at the empty mall parking lot in my car at least three times a week. My only explanation was ""I just need to do this."" Did not know why. No reason to be sad?

• Never let any of my exes do my makeup from the terror of knowing I'll love it.

• Never cross dress in any situation from fear I'd love it.

• Off to college, Mirror thing keeps getting worse. Decide I'm not manly enough and start working out fervently as well as eating an insane amount to build muscle.

• Basically have the perfect male body and it's even worse. Quit. Don't analyze it at all.

• Move in with current fiance, talk about their trans bro and become more open to the topic.

• Research Research. Oh normal people don't feel that mirror thing and it's called dysphoria? Maybe there's another explanation ...

• Finally try on girls clothes for the first time at 19. Euphoria off the fucken charts.

^ And that's the straw that broke the T-Girls back.

2018-12-29 20:43:25,aaosyk,1,1,"Hello, I am a 20 year old heterosexual cis woman who was up until a month ago dating a heterosexual cis man. The day before Thanksgiving I was talking with my partner and our mutual friends on our discord, when all of the sudden they say that they do not feel like they are 100% a man anymore, that they don't quite know what they are or who they want to be but it is not what they are now, physically. 

I panicked and freaked out. Where my other friends were very kind and supportive, I felt like I was in shock. I didn't know what to do or how to feel and ended up questioning our relationship that up until that point I had never done. This was the person I was with for almost 4 years, and someone who has been in my life for over 10 years, a person who up until that point without a doubt I could say I wanted to marry and be with forever. We haven't broken up or anything but it's been really difficult. I'm a very easy crier and I have just been having breakdowns on a weekly basis since that point, and going through phases of either not caring if my partner wants to be my partner and not my boyfriend, and other phases where I just want to leave them and crawl in a whole and die. It seemed as though as soon I was starting to accept something a new change would happen which would kind of cause a stress cycle that I cannot get out of. (Ex. going from shaving entire body to want to be called by new pronouns to want to be called by a new name ect ect...)

Since that point they have had some time to think about it, and have realized that they were not gender-less or non binary as they had originally said, but more like a woman. Which y'know, as a straight woman I have hesitations towards, those hesitations regard the label of calling someone who was always my boyfriend my  ""girlfriend"" and regard the fact that I love them the way they look now and feel like all these big changes would cause me to not love them physically the way I do now. I love this person and who they are on the inside so so much, but I'm worried that all the sudden outer changes and label changes will cause me to panic and want to leave, considering they only came out to me as wanting to be a woman about two or three days ago and I haven't been able to stop crying since then.

I've felt so crappy just because I feel like they is the last thing they need, and that I am a horrible and toxic influence on them, of course they say that I am not, that Im the best thing to every happen to them and that they want me in their lives forever, all I feel like I am doing is hurt. They told me that I could ask anything I want and that I can talk to them about any parts of this that stress me out, but it all stresses me out, to a point where they are worried about giving me updates on their transition

I also live with a pretty conservative mom from the old country, whom I have been keeping this a secret from up until they told me about the desire to be a woman and of course she freaked out. She wants me to leave them, but Idk what I want to do. She brings up valid points concerning the fact that I AM straight, and have always been into men, and also along the lines of me not knowing how far this transition is going to go. At this point they say they want to always keep their current genitalia, and that they want to still look overly feminine, but to just be able to feel more comfortable in their body, but I dont really know how far this is going to go, or what my breaking point is. My breaking point was initially if they decided to be a girl, but I have reached that now and am just scared and confused at this point.

This is the first and only person I have ever been with, they are my best friend, and I love them with all my heart, inside and out, and I just want some guidance and some advice.

I'm actually really happy that I told him because of all things, Dad was one of the few people I was actually afraid of telling because of his conservative views and while he doesn't necessarily agree with the decision because of those views, he also told me that he's willing to accept me regardless of if I go down that path or not and I'm just really happy about that.

So if anyone has any suggestions for both sides of the argument to read for research sake, please, let me know."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Came out to my conservative Dad about questioning gender', 'created': 1546164563.0}"

I'm visiting my parents for the holidays and my brother decided he wanted to clean out a closet with things from the kids' childhoods. So I spent an hour reading through papers and digging up memories that I didn't know I still had from elementary school (about 10 years old). The thing is, in these papers I show every indication of being a stereotypical boy interested in stereotypical boy things. My notebook was full of crude drawings of planes shooting each other and blowing up, stick figure armies at war with poorly drawn guns and trails of dots and dashes to represent the paths of bullets. Hey, don't judge the macabre topics. I was 10 and it was 1990s USA where things like G.I. Joe were marketed straight at me.

(tangentially, i'm also increasingly convinced from reading these papers that I had some level of attention deficit as a child, something I've suspected for a while)

But sitting here now in a dress, having realized suddenly in my 30s that I want to be a woman and that I have wanted that for a very very long time, it really hurts to see how 'boy' I was back then. It hurts to see how neatly I used to fit into a stereotypical mold that I'm actively rejecting today.

I know intellectually that not 'knowing I was trans since I was 4' is fine, that the standard trans narrative was mostly created for cis people, and that the narrative is quite harmful to anyone who didn't have that experience. I guess i'm demonstrating why it's harmful right now. I've made that argument for others who are struggling with impostor feelings so many times. But still, it bothers me. It seems almost silly to be upset by not finding signs of gender issues in a 4th grade scratch-pad. But somehow it still hurts, like intellectual arguments can only get you so far.

I have one or two other gender non-conforming memories or stories from pre-puberty childhood that I cling to. 'Evidence' that I'm trans that I intellectually don't think I should need, but secretly still bring me some small comfort and so I still cling to.

I deeply want to be a girl, and to make that happen I *need to* be trans. That sentence alone should be enough evidence that i'm trans.
