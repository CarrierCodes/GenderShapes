So anyway.  My thought was this:

Is being transgender anything like if someone like myself (not trans) suddenly woke up one morning and was the opposite sex they have always been.

2018-03-01 19:01:20,817qq6,12,31,"Long and ranty, sorry in advance.

So, essentially, I feel like dying.

I am a non op, 22 year old biological female that has felt more boy than girl since I was able to distinguish the two apart. 

However, thanks to a family that is overly concerned about appearances and strong backlash from relatives and friends each time I've tries to explore my gender identity, it was difficult to reach the conclusion that I was trans. I just figured my body hatred was an inherent part of being female.

I met a man and fell in love (another reason why I felt as though I wasn't trans; my sexuality) and the two of us had a baby. Happy family! Except after I gave birth I started to hate myself even more than before.  I thought having a baby would make me finally feel comfortable in my lady body, but in reality, I never felt more out of place. I fell into a deep depression, knowing I could never embody the classic ""motherly"" characteristics all of my other mom friends had. 

A few months ago in my Social Problems class, we discussed the topic of transgenderism. The super progressive and intelligent professor explained it in a way that somehow made it finally click: I'm trans. I'm absolutely trans. I'm 100% positive. And its wonderful! Finally I understand why I feel so out of place in the world!

...Except, its not wonderful. Because I'm the wife of a straight cis man and the mother of his child. We're your picture perfect nuclear family. So what do I do?

Well, I came out to him. I told him in the calmest, most mature way I possibly could. I explained everything to him, and he actually seemed to understand. Hes known about my depression and I've spoken before about my more masculine desires. He admitted he could not be with me if I were to fully transition, which hurt, but I'm understanding of because you can't help or change your sexuality. Other than that, he said I can do what I want and he won't love me any less.

So seeing that he seemed alright with it, I was even more happy! I cut my hair (not drastically, about 6 inches from shoulder length to a pixie-bob sort of thing) and started dressing *slightly* more masculine. Not all the time, just when I went to school or out running errands without him. I didn't ask him to refer to me with male pronouns or call me his boyfriend or anything (though twice we've had sex and he referred to me as his boy without me asking). Basically, it all seemed good for the last few weeks.

But this week, he's been distant and kind of cold. Won't look at me. Won't kiss me. Just giving me this disappointed sad face anytime we make eye contact. When I confronted him on this, he told me he felt as though our relationship is a train, and I've hijacked it and am now holding him and our son hostage. Basically saying in the most terrible, blunt way possible that he feels like I'm forcing this all on him without compromising or anything.

THAT hurt. When I came out I cried, I've told him multiple times that I don't want him to be uncomfortable, that I'm just trying to hate myself less, and I'm not even dressing masculine around him. Yet still, somehow he's come to the conclusion that I'm holding a gun to his head and telling him to accept all of this or I'll shoot. Is it wrong to want your partner's acceptance?

I don't want to transition. It's expensive and socially rough to deal with, and I don't want my son to suffer any unintended consequences. I don't want to give up my status as a wife or a mother. All I'm trying to do is present as male in social situations and to myself. I want to look in the mirror and be happy with what I see. And so far, presenting as male has done just that. 

Today I tried presenting as female again to appease him. It hurt. I felt naked and wrong. I want to dress masculine again but I'm afraid to lose my husband in the process of becoming myself. But if I keep trying to play it off like I'm a girl knowing what I know now, I'm only going to feel more disgusted with myself. All I want right now is someone who understands what this feels like, because I know there's no right answer.

My friend and I were going to see GotG2 way back when. He isn’t so much of a friend, but rather a childhood acquaintance. We have grown up together, but he doesn’t really know anything about me. He is VERY racist and phobic all around, and it constantly gets on my nerves.

Anyway, I’m going with him and my father to see GotG Volume 2. We walk into the lobby, and the person checking tickets looks to be a trans woman (and I hate pointing this out—they’re just women, I get it, but in this instance it is important for the impact).

Anyway, my father is obviously nervous as he is aware that I am (or were) trans. My parents had sent me to rehab the summer before for coming out as trans, so I’m not sure if they think they extinguished that or not.

He hands her the tickets, and she points us in the right direction.

Then my “friend” says the unthinkable. Under his breath, he does the whole “gaaaiiiyyyyy” thing. I wanted to clock him right there, because I am almost 90% sure she heard him.

But I didn’t do anything. It would blow my cover. If I did, I would be jeopardizing everything I tried to repair at rehab.

So we just went on our merry way.

With that said, she gave me so much courage to continue living in hope of a bright future. The amount of courage she must have to have to deal with people like my “friend” is insane.

2018-03-06 10:47:55,82e61f,3,0,"I loosely consider myself genderfluid, being a biologically male bisexual who on, occasion likes to wear dresses. This doesn't really pertain to my argument, but I figured I'd get it out of the way.

A question that I've had for a while, that has continued to plague me the more I think about it, relates to the validity of the transgender movement as a whole. I have yet to actually meet any trans people in person who I've had an opportunity to really sit down with since I started considering the matter, and I figured I might reach out online to find people's opinions.

Essentially, my question boils down to this:

*What is the point of gender?*

I suppose I should start by defining my terms. By gender I mean the social and personal perception of being a man or a woman, and I view it as mostly constructed of two components: the social perception of your gender (essentially stereotypes, presumptions, and pronouns), and the biological component, being genitalia, hormones, breasts, etc.

My perspective originated with looking at myself and noting the obvious femininity (which I consider different to female-ness, but I'll get to that later) mixed with some masculinity, and realising that my gender (seemingly) played 0 role in my self perception/self worth, etc. (I suppose this might not be the case for everyone, and this is something I find very interesting about transgenderism, as it seems like one of the rare cases where people talk about this being important) Once I started looking at how the distinctions based on gender society creates flounder when faced by transgenderism (consider the MtF soccer player who, despite having man-strength, plays the womans league), I came to the conclusion that it's just not a wholly accurate representation of anything about a person. Sure, the top men are all stronger than the top women, but for the average, men and women are all functionally identical, falling within 1 standard deviation of each other in every trait. (that's not actually a backed up point, I heard it somewhere, and whether or not it's strictly true, the argument still stands).

Sure, it's useful to look at someone, see that they're female, and be able to gauge a whole gamut of traits, but time after time people just aren't fitting into it in the modern day. Most people, probably at least 60-80% are cis-gendered and straight, but for the rest of us, we're still a significant portion. I think that everyone has some blend of masculinity and femininity. Distinctions of female and male seemingly effectively enforce the this requirement of ""men must be masculine"" and ""females must be feminine"" without, by sheer statistical anomaly, everyone fitting in.

Gender, as I said, seems to come down to the social aspect, and the biological aspect. The social aspect, as a society, we're getting over. We're realising that dictating how someone should behave based off of gender is dumb. And the biological aspect, as I mentioned earlier, whilst significant over the population, in terms of the individual, isn't the whole picture for any trait, and for 90% of the populous, there are people of the opposite sex who are more masculine and people more feminine than they are. Furthermore, with advances in science, the biological sex of a person will soon no longer be fixed. This seems to invalidate the worth of gender as a construct entirely.

Now, as for how my question pertains to the trans community:

*By redifining your gender (where it doesn't seem to fit as, say, a male) to a female what exactly are you changing? And by doing so, do you worry that you're still defining yourself by the rubric of genders as enforced by society, which have been demonstrated to be flawed time and time again?*

I worry at times that transgenderism is essentially just observing the stereotypes that exist for the opposite gender and feeling that they would apply better to you.

I worry that transgenderism involves a changing of the self to fit gender stereotypes, any gender stereotypes, no matter their source.

I worry that transgenderism, whilst easier to explain to a cis gender than agenderism, is propping up the frankly antiquated notion of gender as an idea.

I don't see the point.

Please share with me your thoughts! I'm very interested to hear what you have to say!

By gender I mean the social and personal perception of being a man or a woman, and I view it as mostly constructed of two components: the social perception of your gender (essentially stereotypes, presumptions, and pronouns), and the biological component, being genitalia, hormones, breasts, etc.\n\nMy perspective originated with looking at myself and noting the obvious femininity (which I consider different to female-ness, but I\'ll get to that later) mixed with some masculinity, and realising that my gender (seemingly) played 0 role in my self perception/self worth, etc. (I suppose this might not be the case for everyone, and this is something I find very interesting about transgenderism, as it seems like one of the rare cases where people talk about this being important) Once I started looking at how the distinctions based on gender society creates flounder when faced by transgenderism (consider the MtF soccer player who, despite having man-strength, plays the womans league), I came to the conclusion that it\'s just not a wholly accurate representation of anything about a person. Sure, the top men are all stronger than the top women, but for the average, men and women are all functionally identical, falling within 1 standard deviation of each other in every trait. (that\'s not actually a backed up point, I heard it somewhere, and whether or not it\'s strictly true, the argument still stands).\n\nSure, it\'s useful to look at someone, see that they\'re female, and be able to gauge a whole gamut of traits, but time after time people just aren\'t fitting into it in the modern day. Most people, probably at least 60-80% are cis-gendered and straight, but for the rest of us, we\'re still a significant portion. I think that everyone has some blend of masculinity and femininity. Distinctions of female and male seemingly effectively enforce the this requirement of ""men must be masculine"" and ""females must be feminine"" without, by sheer statistical anomaly, everyone fitting in.\n\nGender, as I said, seems to come down to the social aspect, and the biological aspect. The social aspect, as a society, we\'re getting over. We\'re realising that dictating how someone should behave based off of gender is dumb. And the biological aspect, as I mentioned earlier, whilst significant over the population, in terms of the individual, isn\'t the whole picture for any trait, and for 90% of the populous, there are people of the opposite sex who are more masculine and people more feminine than they are. Furthermore, with advances in science, the biological sex of a person will soon no longer be fixed. This seems to invalidate the worth of gender as a construct entirely.\n\nNow, as for how my question pertains to the trans community:\n\n*By redifining your gender (where it doesn\'t seem to fit as, say, a male) to a female what exactly are you changing? And by doing so, do you worry that you\'re still defining yourself by the rubric of genders as enforced by society, which have been demonstrated to be flawed time and time again?*\n\nI worry at times that transgenderism is essentially just observing the stereotypes that exist for the opposite gender and feeling that they would apply better to you.\n\nI worry that transgenderism involves a changing of the self to fit gender stereotypes, any gender stereotypes, no matter their source.\n\nI worry that transgenderism, whilst easier to explain to a cis gender than agenderism, is propping up the frankly antiquated notion of gender as an idea.\n\nI don\'t see the point.\n\nPlease share with me your thoughts!

2018-03-08 04:17:51,82urrb,4,20,"Currently being 17 years old, I have gone through a handful of rough patches of “dysphoria” since I was 14/15. The first was when I first hatched out of my egg.

The dysphoria hit so hard and I couldn’t *not* think about it. So, I recklessly attempted suicide because I was afraid of coming out to my parents. I didn’t succeed, but I was forced to come out to them at the mental hospital I was transferred to. They respond need lime expected, and I found myself in a faith-based rehab center for the next three months.

During that time, the idea that I was a girl persisted. In my first two weeks, I found a friend, and came out to them through a note because I knew I could trust them. Well, he was able to leave the center the next week, and apparently they found my note and I got into a lot of trouble.

After that, I had to suppress all of those feelings for the rest of the stay. In fact, it kinda disappeared a bit—if not completely. I still thought of myself as a girl, but I didn’t let it get to me too much.

By the end of my stay, I had to tell my parents that I wasn’t a girl in order to leave, so I did. After I left, I actually thought it *was* all a phase. That I was just caught up in some emotional wave of confusion or something.

The next year was spent without any phone or computer, and contestant monitoring from my parents. During this time, I can recall being EXTREMELY disassociated—but no dysphoria at all. I wasn’t a girl in my mind.

Eventually I got access to a computer. Then, I found myself on a group chat online and I began presenting myself as a girl there. For some reason, it was at that moment that all of that dysphoria cake crashing back into my body and mind. It felt like all the anxiety in the world had come to haunt me—for what? Talking in a group chat? It was strange, and that feeling reminded me to be careful of this “phase” mentality. So, I stopped going on those group chats and my dysphoria went away again. 

I was busy with a job and school, so I didn’t have time to think about that stuff.

Coming back to the present, it was only last week that I discovered all of these subreddits. And let me tell you: the dysphoria is fucking back, and worse than ever. Earlier today I was even contemplating suicide because I am so unsure of whether this is a phase or not.

The fact that I am only feeling this bad when I focus on trans stuff makes me think it *is* one very long phase. If it isn’t a phase, then why am I not feeling dysphoric consistently?

What does this mean? Honestly, the time I have spent on these subs is doing more harm than good, and I don’t want to go down some rabbit hole only to find out I am not a girl and I just threw my social and family impressions out the window. This all may just be a weird way for me to rebel against my parents.

Okay, now to my somewhat innocent question: So I've got several trans friends, and have been intimate with a few trans girls, and I've noticed the obvious, and saw that the HRT causes the penis to shrink, and become far less functional. Never really bothered to measure the testicle difference. 

Now, when I watch trans porn, I've noticed that while these women look like they're pretty far into their transition, their penises seem to operate at full function, and at full size. Trans girls with large penises are even a sub-genre in the genre of porn. 

So basically, I'm wondering how exactly that works. Is what I'm seeing in porn purely cosmetic other than the breast implants, or is there some kind of drug that offsets the shrinking and impotence, or is there something else here I'm not considering?

I can barely keep myself together.  I wrote a text to my mother and later a message to my sisters.

We had a funeral to attend last month and the entirety of them clocked me.  I was able to easily come out to them, and I felt it was time to tell my family.  This is honestly one of the scariest things to deal with and I just needed to share a message to the rest of you that the journey is all about small milestones.

As a wonderful Wilson Phillips song taught me

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

The response from my mother was short as she is probably trying to process this.  I hope that I didn't just block of an entire part of my life, but I also just feel this pressure relief that is hard to describe.

Update:

Okay so my mother was decent at first, but slowly she started talking about God's plan and what I was doing and how I was losing myself to the world.  At first her reaction was harmless and a little shock driven but now it seems she dug her heels into religion and is going to latch on like a crocodile.

My eldest sister claimed that she was extremely dissappointed with me and that I should just ignore the feelings I have inside and turn to Jesus to cure me.  She also said that she ""loves me... But"" we all know that means her love is actually conditional.  It hurts to hear that my choice to finally find my happiness is something I should just completely ignore.

Finally was my last sister.  She is the middle child and my best friend from my childhood.  She had some questions and concerns, and wanted to make sure I was fine.  She took things honestly the best compared to anyone else.  I am greatful that at least part of my childhood didn't die today and I have at least 1 family member from the 5 of us that still wants me alive on this Earth.  She even invited me to her house after she closes for a house warming party and promised that none of the other family members would be present for my own security.  I seriously love her.

This puts the clock on when I will tell my close friends and eventually my Facebook followers and friends.

This is honestly one of the scariest things to deal with and I just needed to share a message to the rest of you that the journey is all about small milestones.\n\nAs a wonderful Wilson Phillips song taught me\n\nSome day somebody\'s gonna make you want to\nTurn around and say goodbye\nUntil then baby are you going to let them\nHold you down and make you cry\nDon\'t you know?\nDon\'t you know things can change\nThings\'ll go your way\nIf you hold on for one more day\nCan you hold on for one more day\nThings\'ll go your way\nHold on for one more day\n\nThe response from my mother was short as she is probably trying to process this.  I hope that I didn\'t just block of an entire part of my life, but I also just feel this pressure relief that is hard to describe.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOkay so my mother was decent at first, but slowly she started talking about God\'s plan and what I was doing and how I was losing myself to the world.  At first her reaction was harmless and a little shock driven but now it seems she dug her heels into religion and is going to latch on like a crocodile.\n\nMy eldest sister claimed that she was extremely dissappointed with me and that I should just ignore the feelings I have inside and turn to Jesus to cure me.  She also said that she ""loves me... But"" we all know that means her love is actually conditional.  It hurts to hear that my choice to finally find my happiness is something I should just completely ignore.\n\nFinally was my last sister.  She is the middle child and my best friend from my childhood.  She had some questions and concerns, and wanted to make sure I was fine.  She took things honestly the best compared to anyone else.  I am greatful that at least part of my childhood didn\'t die today and I have at least 1 family member from the 5 of us that still wants me alive on this Earth.  She even invited me to her house after she closes for a house warming party and promised that none of the other family members would be present for my own security.  I seriously love her.\n\nThis puts the clock on when I will tell my close friends and eventually my Facebook followers and friends.  IDK if I will make a video explaining myself or a thoughtful post, but that is future Michelle\'s worry and today I will take the semi positive response I got from immediate family.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I just came out to my mother and sisters', 'created': 1520725833.0}"

I was born male, and while I identify with certain aspects of being male I always felt like I was a blend of male / female. 
I want to present as female, as in getting top surgery and appearing female in public, but I don't want bottom surgery. Not because I'm afraid of losing my genitalia but because I feel like that is the truest expression of who I am.

I'm just not sure what that's called, and even though I've always hated labels I am curious what others in the transgender community would identify that as, and what I should use to communicate to others who I am with transparency.
I've read that intergender and androgynous are two separate things, and I was wondering if I fell into either-neither-or both of those categories.

He said that this airport the Appleton, Wisconsin Airport, has older scanners than Arkansas. That the newer ones are smarter and don't flag stuff like silicone prosthetics. Soooo??

2018-03-15 07:32:37,84kow6,10,2,"I've been feeling REALLY repressed recently, and I know that if theres anywhere for me to just let it all out it's probably here.

Preface: I'm a 15 (16 in a few days) closeted transgirl. I've sorta felt that way for most of my life, doing things girls do anyway without thinking about it, but since January of 2017 I've known for sure this is what I want to do. I've been pretending to be a girl online instead, gradually coming out to the people I communicate with solely online (Easier than face to face, and they don't have to worry about my appearance between then and starting transition). In November I came out face to face with someone for the first time; my friend that I used to walk home with. She was 100% accepting and supportive enough that shes tried pushing me to just start displaying as a girl, to which I told her I'm aiming for the begining of next school year (Giving me all summer break to get used to it), which she accepted. Right after that, in October, I came out to my step mom, who is also very accepting, but she's sceptical about it. I've tried everything short of lying to her about how long I've known. The day after I told her, I received a 30 minute screaming session from my father. He only brought up the actual issue once, the rest was more drivel stroking his Respect Complex (A few days ago was the first time since then he actually brought it up, where he tried to say he understood what I was going through and that he supported me, which is good enough despite him obviously not knowing what I'm going through, or he'd be a woman). 

Good god I've put more work into writing that than my homework this week an- wait, when does the preface end? I don't know, whatever

Anyway, that was stuff about coming out... I think... It's late and I'm basically crying right now, I'm not sure what I'm typing...

I've been trying to set up an opportunity for me to go out with a friend and have them dress me up as a girl so I can feel any relief from this, but I've either chickened out cause I think I'm too much of an atrocity to ever look remotely like a woman, or because I'm just too depressed to just even do anything. It's especially harder because my parents think they need every single last little minute detail of what I'm doing if I'm not at home, and I don't know that I want to tell them that's what I'm doing cause I don't know how they'll feel about it.

And the reason I'm not doing all this complaining to my friends is I don't want to bug them. The friend that originally offered to take me out is somewhere around ""Popular"" status and lives a few towns away from me, so I don't want to take up her time... and money. Christ clothes are expensive...

I think I'm just gonna post this as it is and just reply to comments as they come (Time to pray I didn't hit any character limit)

2018-03-17 12:18:33,853dzn,0,7,"Oh boy where to start. I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am transgender Mtf. From age 3 or 4 I felt like a female. I believe it got going being around my cousins at the time. They always wore cute dresses etc and I had those tight wrangler and such. I can remember those time so vivid and struggled ever since. 
At an early age I had promised myself I would become a female later in life because my family  have always been so religious and talked down on anyone who seemed different. 
So, I did the usual. Stealing my mom's panties, girlfriends when they came into the picture, etc. I would wear them in the comfort of my bed and would pray to wake up without my boy parts and be a female. It was bad. I would always imagine being the girl if I was watching any porn or having sex. It was the only way for me to feel right and orgasm. 
Fast forward some 10 years and countless ill fitting panties, clothing and an even more desire to be what I imagined in my head I would feel. Enter my Rave days. I never thought I would see the light. I could be me and dress how I wanted and no one judged. Party kids, transgender party kids all of the alphabet. I loved that time. 
I never felt threatened or hit on. I was me. Dancing full girl mode and never had an issue. 
I miss those days and the feeling have never faded. 
Anyway, now that I got side tracked. Here I am married with kids and finally came to the realization life is to short to not live how you want to. This has been for over 5 years now and I have ditched my male things and ways to be more fem. Clothes, undies, makeup, shaving the whole experience. The learning process has been crazy hit or miss. 
Between a drawer full of panties that maybe 5 fit perfect to scratching my head over female clothing sizes. That shit is all over the place. 
Living full time I have come to see that the struggles that females go through are real. I have so much more respect for them and my wife. I have remorse for some things I did early on in life and how I treated some females as objects. 
Well, I contacted a therapist for some counseling. I really do not want grs but an orchi due to testicular cancer running in my family and killing my father. My wife supports this and understands. I know I can also legally change my name and asked her to pick one out. I also asked her if she would remarry me. I would take her maiden name and it would be very special to me to be her wife. 
I bought a wedding dress and some stuff for the big day that I hope comes soon. We discussed doing our wedding like our original but as wife and wife. Just her and I. 
I don't know where all this may lead but I can say I am so happy that I told her years ago how I felt and I am in debt to her because she accepts me for the female I am. 
Hopefully in a few months or maybe a year I will  be her wife and walking down the beach in my gown saying I do. 
I know this has been choppy but I wanted to try and keep it as short as possible. 

Love,
Heather Renee  (Rea)

Dancing full girl mode and never had an issue. \nI miss those days and the feeling have never faded. \nAnyway, now that I got side tracked. Here I am married with kids and finally came to the realization life is to short to not live how you want to. This has been for over 5 years now and I have ditched my male things and ways to be more fem. Clothes, undies, makeup, shaving the whole experience. The learning process has been crazy hit or miss. \nBetween a drawer full of panties that maybe 5 fit perfect to scratching my head over female clothing sizes. That shit is all over the place. \nLiving full time I have come to see that the struggles that females go through are real. I have so much more respect for them and my wife. I have remorse for some things I did early on in life and how I treated some females as objects. \nWell, I contacted a therapist for some counseling. I really do not want grs but an orchi due to testicular cancer running in my family and killing my father. My wife supports this and understands. I know I can also legally change my name and asked her to pick one out. I also asked her if she would remarry me. I would take her maiden name and it would be very special to me to be her wife. \nI bought a wedding dress and some stuff for the big day that I hope comes soon. We discussed doing our wedding like our original but as wife and wife. Just her and I. \nI don't know where all this may lead but I can say I am so happy that I told her years ago how I felt and I am in debt to her because she accepts me for the female I am. \nHopefully in a few months or maybe a year I will  be her wife and walking down the beach in my gown saying I do. \nI know this has been choppy but I wanted to try and keep it as short as possible. \n\nLove,\nHeather Renee  (Rea)\n "", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Finally decided to start full time transition', 'created': 1521314313.0}"

I currently live with my parents and will be for the next year and a half. Over the past year my mum's emotionally blackmailed me into stopping any form of transition and I now have to live as someone I hate. I think I've held up fairly well for the past year but I think now I'm really starting to crack, especially with the stress from school. 

My mental health isn't critical right now. I'm not on the edge of a cliff, more just travelling down this straight path that's tilted downwards slightly. And I really can't see it getting any better between now and me leaving home in over a year.

I'm really starting to become worried about this and I'm really concerned that I'll end up snapping one day, either hurting myself, someone else, or breaking up my family. I don't want any of these things but I'm totally backed into a corner for the next year and a half. 

I don't know what to do. I can't change my situation at home and I can't change my underlying feelings about my gender.I just have to stew here, slowly going mad. 

Do you have any advice on what I should do, or ways that you've found to cope with these kinds of situations? Things that I can do to alleviate the pain or just block it out?

I'm 21, MtF and recently came out to my therapist who I've been seeing since September 2017 for gender related stuff. Ever since then I've been feleing guilty of wanting to transition and come out to my family. Right now it is easy for me to hide everything from them as my family and I live in different countries. I feel guilty because I am the only child in my whole big family (grandpa, mom, dad, dad's brother and his wife, dad'sister and her husband). They have worked very hard throughout their whole lives to reach where they are now and have worked hard for me too to send me to a foreign country for my studies. Even though I have pretty much taken care of myself (both funancially and physically) since i was 17, I still feel that I am crushing their hopes and dreams by wanting to transition. I want all of them to have a relaxed and happy old age because they deserve it and I feel that if I transition it will not be the case for them. All their hopes are literally in 1 basket (me). I will definitely pay off all the money they spent for me to be here (already halfway through) but I want to do a lot more than that for them. 
They definitely will not understand me being trans and will be SERIOUSLY dissapointed. My parents will either disown me or be very angry or go into kind of hopeless depression and I do not want to be the cause of that. They have done a lot for me and I want to return a lot more than what they have done. I do not feel obligated; I sincerely want to make their old age as relaxed as possible and I know that if I transition or even come out it will be bad for them. But at the same time I feel that I need to transition too. I already regret that I didnt ""find myself"" earlier and did not start transitioning. Both these needs are equal to me (transitioning outweighs other by a little from time to time) but I know that doing one will not let me do the other. Other being setting up a peaceful retirement for my family.
I'm really really confused about what to do. I want ti start transition now at least the hrt and the surgeries can wait a couple of years; but, I do not want to disappoint my family either especially after everything they've done for me.

2018-03-23 03:50:43,86hszd,0,2,"okay, so when I first learned about hrt, I looked up the risks, and had a general idea of what to expect. People online told me that i would feel nothing upon taking them, in a few weeks I would know if it was for me somehow (they didn't exactly clarify), and that slowly over months i would have some changes to my body.

So I was extremely worried about if they would let me have HRT, I asked lots of questions about peoples process of getting it, most refused to comment on the subject which I found odd, most just said I would have likely a 2 hour conversation on the ins and outs of HRT, they would have me sign tons of paperwork, and draw my blood.

So that's kind of what I was lead to believe for getting HRT. I found a doctor and since no one would clarify on the questions I might get or anything, I decided to go full fem, to increase my chances. Well the doctor asked me If I went to therapy (which I said no for personal reasons), If I was a woman (which of course yes), and what my sexuality was (Pansexual). The nurse before hand had also asked me if I was on birth control (which was a no). So the doctor tells me he will give me pills (Spironolactone and Estradoil) and sends me to get my blood drawn. People online mentioned I needed my hormones checked beforehand, so i called and asked if they were checking that and they informed me thy don't do that until later. 2 weeks later He said my blood pressure was a little high, probably because I was scared but everything else was normal, then I got my HRT.

So, I received 50mg Spironolactone and 1mg Estradoil pills, to be taken twice a day. He had informed me upon getting them for the first week to only take the morning dosages so my body could adjust to it. The pills were incredibly tiny and I expected little to not results since I was 25.

Upon taking them i felt nothing, then I checked my phone 45 minutes had passed, and suddenly I am hit with vertigo, almost fell to the ground, felt like dysphoria lessened, my mind expanded and got all soft and airy, my nose cleared up, and my skin was pinching in pain everywhere. It all just hit me at once. My body was in physical pain from it and I had just had to steady myself back to standing, so I freaked. I called my doctor and he refused to come to the phone but the nurses said it was normal. I couldn't find anyone online who had similar so I was a bit scared. That pain lasted for 2 days on it. Then things started to get worse.

I would take the pills and immediately my nipples would be sore, on top of this sometimes my wrists would cramp up so badly I would almost scream in pain, within a minute of taking it i was having painful reactions. 5 to 10 minutes later I would get vertigo, and this stabbing throbbing pain in my limbs, felt like they wanted to explode, was so painful I couldn't walk for a bit and thought I was dying. About a month in I had hip joint pain where I couldn't walk on my leg because my joint felt like it had this crunching pain, both my hip joints had this and popped.

A few months in i had nipple lactation and some people said that was normal, others said cancer, and others still hormone imbalance. i also had major hot flashes which again some said was normal or a hormone imbalance but those went away after a few months. My boobs never really hurt aside from a few armpit twinges and nipple soreness which only hurt when touched or for those first few months right after taking hrt, even then it was on par with a bruise. Most people complain about boob pain so no idea. I later on got progesterone and within seconds I had lactation and my nipples would become either hard or soft, had someone else witness it, so I know it isn't in my head, and I certainly wasn't expecting it.

At about a year in I started to have period symptoms, well noticeable ones anyways. Many people argue If this is even possible, I am not sure, but I will explain what happens to me. So I have a cycle of around every 28 days, where for 7 days I will get a variety of symptoms. It starts out with me getting a slight sore throat and my skin getting a bit softer a day or two in advance. Then day 1 starts and I get bloating, muscle cramps, headache, nausia, headfog, hotflashes, breast increase, all my strength sapped, mood swings, full on sore throat, I get a lot more tired, my skin gets softer, my skin is more sensitive and my immune system gets noticeably lower (I get sick only like once a year and now its every few months just after a monthly). i have had other people verify the cramping, hot flashes, bloating, skin softness/sensitivity, as well as them notice the other symptoms though they can't exactly verify those.

I am currently 19 months in, D cups, my hips sway when I walk, my hands shrank, as well as my feet, and so far I have lost 2.5 inches on my height.

I have been told by many people all of this isn't possible, some say it is, and other claim it is from other things. Some say hormone imbalance, others say intersex, others say flat out impossible the meds need more time to enter your system, been told the hand in feet shrinkage might be due to less cartilage and ligaments.

I am just laying out what has happened to me, no idea how or why any of it is possible, but yeah I am lost with what is within the realm of normal and what is not, for HRT. My doctors have explained nothing to me, in terms of what is normal for HRT. After I got on it I started hearing people talking about how they made transition plans with their doctors and how their doctor had long conversations with them about how it all works and I have had none of it.

Offline, at the very least (I already shared that with a couple of people I know online that I know I'll never meet anyways). But the thing is, spend too much time with the knowledge that you're trans, and you kind of want to let somebody close to you know.

2018-03-24 19:55:58,86vix0,4,3,"So, this is a bit complicated. Or maybe I am just over-complicating it.

Firstly, I am with a dude who is straight. Totally love him, been together 7 years. He was the one who helped me figure out that I was Gender nonconforming, and then later that I was Trans*. So he's pretty open minded and cool like that. Secondly, I am, like I said, Trans*. And have been fighting with the idea of transitioning.

The problem I am dealing with that is concerning is that my Fiance identifies as cis and straight. He has been having a hard time coming to terms with the idea that while I do have a vagina, I am not a female. I mean he isn't against it, but more like a bit uncomfortable.

We have talked about the possibility of me transitioning vaguely, and he has openly said that he doesn't think he would be able to be with me if I am on T and am fully transitioning. But we have talked and kind of compromised, because taking hormones of any type have a bad habit of make me physically ill, so no T. And instead of full top surgery, maybe just a breast reduction from a DDD to a B or C. And absolutely no bottom surgery.

But, I don't know. Part of me would like to get on T even if it makes me sick because I have major self conscious issues with my voice. Like I'm okay with not growing extra body hair, because I find it gross anyway, and the other potential issues are like, whatever. But I have legit panic attacks (I have anxiety and depression so that doesn't help either) when I hear the sound of my own voice. And I really would like a more masculine looking body because I am very curvy. I have a huge amount of friends who keep low-key shaming me for having what they call the ideal feminine body type, but I don't want it. And they keep trying to make me feel bad for ""wasting"" the looks I was given.

I am honestly not sure how to handle it or talk with him about it.

2018-03-24 20:38:53,86vt5e,2,3,"I have at least informally changed my name with some of my friends, but I have been struggling with the idea of changing it legally.

The main reason against the legal name change is because my legal name means so much to my mother. She named me the way she did because I was able to be born. She had three miscarriages before me and was told by doctors that she would never be able to have a child. So I was her little miracle. An accident, but a miracle.

Now jump 22 year later, and I have figured that I am Trans* at this point and my friends have been calling me by a gender neutral nickname based on my birth name since I was 8 years old, so for 14 years. But I asked several of them who were open minded to call me by a masculine name and they were cool with it, and then I introduced myself by that name in college, so everyone at the college I go to calls me that now that I'm 28.

This includes my mom who pretends that I never came out, but has openly told me that I am not allowed to go to the men's section while shopping with her, when she had no issues with this before I came out.

  So I had a question for you. I am stealth, trans guy. I wear a binder every day since I can't afford top surgery. I have a full beard, and no one ever calls me ma'am anymore. But I worry about my binder giving me away. My friends all say I just look buff, but I have D breasts, and I've tried every binder in the market. I use gc2b now. It gets me kind of flat, but not cis man flat.
  Do you think I should be worried? About being ""found out""at school or the workplace? What are some suggestions anyone has for not worrying, or wearing other clothes to help? I find jackets tend to help, but it's warming up again.

2018-03-31 19:37:34,88l34g,2,3,"After waiting for a few months I finally had my court hearing and my identity is in the process of getting updated. I'm happy, but I've been going through old pictures with family (and just generally sorting and scrubbing my files so deadme doesn't come up at a bad moment if/when I finally go stealth) and I wonder about the ones with me in them. I feel so far removed from that person now, but I'm having trouble figuring out if the person I am moving towards is who I really want to be. I was more consistently happy before when I hadn't alienated myself from all my family and former friends, but if I chose to detransition (if that's the correct term) I don't know that I would be able to do it in a way that makes everyone happy. I don't think I could ever stop hormones. I guess you could say that I have a psychological addiction to them. I like looking physically feminine. But does that mean I'm trans, or am I just effeminate and in denial about that?

When my family deadnames me, it makes me really angry. Misgendering does not bother me as much, just because it's happened to me before and I understand that it can be confusing for people initially. They do both intentionally though, because they do not believe in transgender people. I have tried so hard to compromise for them, I originally tried to be androgynous, even chose an androgynous name, and I do tend to lean that direction, but it's not good enough. I'm not good enough.

How I've chosen to identify is still confusing for me, and I often misgender myself in my head, which makes me concerned sometimes that I'm not trans. It happens more often when I think of who I used to be, or my old name, which thankfully does not come up as often as before now that I'm legal. When I think of myself now I almost feel genderless. Gender does become somewhat irrelevant when you walk through life with blinders on because you're afraid of every person's reaction to you. The obvious solution is not to care so much, but it's easier said than done. My mind kind of defaults to anxiety and it feels impossible to stop. The more you think about it, the more self conscious you get, the worse it gets. Don't think about the Game. Anyway...

I'm really self conscious about how I act a lot of times, and it makes me a really anxious person. I especially seek approval from the women at my job, but at the same time I feel like I've made myself an outsider to those who knew me before. It's different and much easier with people who have been hired since I started transitioning, but I also don't know them that well. There's a disproportionate amount of men at my job, especially on my team, and wandering the office is awkward because it makes me more self-conscious about my tuck, mainly because of the way it feels when I walk. It feels kinda gross. Some days it feels really gross because I've started electrolysis there... It's getting increasingly hard for me to go into work, and I've been working from home every other day as a result. I'm not a hermit, but if it weren't for church and grocery runs it's pretty close to it some weeks.

I know people read this anxiousness, and it causes me not to pass as well (though physically I pass extremely well since VFS, even though I haven't had anything else done) and be a difficult person to be around. I feel like through this journey I've explored a different side of my personality I might have been suppressing, but know I'm not as femininely spirited as other women, even though I try (awkwardly) to present that way on the outside, and I beat myself up about it. Sometimes I feel like looking feminine is something I have to force myself to do. Don't get me wrong, I like the result, sometimes it just feels like such a chore. I'm absolutely horrible at accessorizing, partly because I don't really spend a lot of time at stores with good jewelry and bags, etc. I need to change my habits, but I'm almost afraid to. I'm very prone to getting stuck in familiar cycles. Ruts... This just happens to be the latest one. There's just added pressure now because there's so much I can and need to do since I got my name and letter updated. I plan to get a job with better insurance at some point so I can finish all this and get on with my life. I have thought about SRS (or whatever the trendy acronym is for it these days) for a while, and I definitely want it done at least for practical reasons, but also more than that. I won't get into too much detail because that's kind of a personal decision.

I was watching an old Disney Channel movie about a girl who accidentally publishes her diary, ""Read It and Weep"" because I remembered really enjoying it when I was younger, and also that it was kind of girly. It's silly since most of the characters are significantly younger than I am, but I got really jealous of how well dressed the younger girls were.

I worry sometimes that I won't be a good mom, or develop good motherly characteristics. I think that these characteristics are important especially if we're getting married (I'm still not sure about that) but even to be a good friend to my girlfriends who might have kids, and to fit into my role in the church, which I'm still not sure is supposed to look like. There aren't a lot of role differences described in the Bible (and many of them relate to roles within marriage), but they are there.

Sorry if this post was really rambly. I guess I'm not really looking for any specific input.
