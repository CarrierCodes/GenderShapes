I wasn't particularly girly, but I never liked sports on account of the environment, and mostly stuck to myself or a small circle of other nerds. We moved around, so I never really established close friends, and when puberty hit, I started feeling more and more of the anxiety and depression that followed me around during childhood. My friend circle went from mostly male to mostly female, although I had plenty of male acquaintances and dudes I'd hang out with, but never get super close to, and if I did, I'd always feel like we weren't quite connecting.

The high school I went to was an all-male military school, and I had to wear a uniform every day, and I never really felt at home except in the theater program, which was held at the girls' school nearby, and also was where I made most of my friends.

She kept  talking about it and i already didnt wanted to listen to what she was  saying....

Especially in a small  town, where people can be a little old fashion and be less tollerant no  one ever really stared at me in a weird way or said anything... and when  we made trips to bigger citys and went to the theater etc n one ever  gave me those ""stares."" even when i was in bigger crowds. I really was  so happy i could just blend into society and be female when im outside  and at home... And from what my therapist says there is no such a thing  as like complete ""Passing"" for her... it made me really anxious and i  got lost in my thoughts when she talked..... After the appointment was  over we left her office and walked to the secretary. We passed the  waiting room and she'd still continue talking about how she notices that  im trans and its because she is professional.

3. when i try to pitch it low

I’m non-binary and I have been on testosterone twice, the first time for two months, the second time for three. 

I was off and on because I just wanted some changes. After this second round I feel like I’ve gotten to a good place with my voice and body hair and I’m content. 

But I’ve noticed my voice has changed in the six months since I was last on T! Since I don’t see a lot of people talking about their experiences going on and off T multiple times I thought I would share mine. 

My voice deeper now than it was before the second round, but now i can pitch my voice higher without discomfort more than i could right after i stopped taking it.

I noticed this after my first time taking T as well, but less drastically because my voice didn’t get as low as it did the second time. 

I just think it’s cool because while there is a definite permanent change to my voice, things changed physically after I stopped T as well.

She has said she did some research on how to be supportive, but even if I ask her she wont give me her thoughts or opinions or even general reaction to my being trans. We are otherwise very close and talk all day everyday via text or Google Chat. I’ve only pushed her on it once and she replied she has nothing to say.

I’m obviously here asking because I think I might be being too judgemental. My logic is that when I was doing a lot of research for myself, I for sure read a heck of a lot of crap and bad info.

I don’t think that she necessarily has bad opinions, she could just be reading crap. I’ve even explained this logic to her but it didn’t change anything.


I cannot *cannot* lose her. I fully expect the most of my family to have some roughness when I come out, then come around over time. It’s only my dad that I think it's possible to fully lose.

That being said, I didn't dismiss what he did.

2018-05-09 19:29:19,8i8qac,8,15,"I am so sorry if I shouldn’t be posting here if I am still figuring things out I have always associated with the term transgender when I thought about it and it was recently suggested I consider exploring more including non-binary. I am also sorry for just how much I have to say I don't know how to edit myself sometimes.

My question is more do I deserve to “come out” as Trans or Non Binary than am I those things. And does my story line up with people in this community enough that I can associate with it.

I am 22/female I am confident but self-deprecating, that’s important I think. 

Aesthetically my mental picture of myself is a guy and that has always been my normal. I have always dressed myself as a guy hell when I was in preschool I cried when I spilled juice on my pants and my only back up clothes was a dress, my mom had to pick me up early because I wouldn’t leave the bathroom wearing it.  But I dismiss that as “I just like guy’s clothes that isn’t important or significant”.

In middle school I hardcore stared to hate being called a girl or worse yet a young lady, it made me cringe. I didn’t want to be called a boy either I just didn’t want it addressed. I was wearing oversized clothes including jackets in the dead of summer to cover my body. I also rebelled against bras because that was going to be crossing a hard line into becoming a woman. At this point I thought I was just scared of growing up and puberty. As I am typing this I realize for the first time that I wasn’t scared to grow up as much as I was scared of becoming a woman, it’s weird when things make sense when you talk it out for real for the first time. I thought it was normal to hate yourself and your body so I let it lie.

High school was just me dressing like a guy in a construction class trring desperately to convince other that my online boyfriend was real and I wasn’t gay.

In college I made a few great progressive fiends, learned that life isn’t black and white, male and female for the first time and I started to feel ok-ish.

About a year ago I joked with my boyfriend (the totally real one from high school) about how “I dress like a guy I should just be one lol” and he joked back “omg just come out as trans already lol” and it has not left my mind once since then. A little while after that I threw out all of the feminine clothes I held onto but never wore and I bought my first sports bra in years and then another and another until it was all I had. I had a panic attack a few months ago about how much I hated being a girl in this world and cried until I fell asleep but that’s mostly frustration over the social/political climate.
 
I know I can’t be cis and feel this way but I also feel like I don’t deserve to “come out” as anything especially if I don’t know exactly what that anything is and If all I feel like I need to be totally happy is cut my hair, bind my chest and MAYBE be referred to as him/he. My now husband has in the last few days told me for the millionth time that he would love me no matter how I presented. My mom would never understand and kind of just be confused by it but would just be supportive. My friends don’t feel close enough to really care one way or another.

I DO NOT want to be all like “This is ME now” when I haven’t face nearly the hardships that some people have with their gender identity that’s why I ask if I deserve to feel this way. 

TLDR: I know I am not a cis gender female and if I did “come out” as anything else I would be loved and supported by who matter to me but should I if I won’t be making any big changes in my life? Would it be worth it to tell my mom that I don’t feel like a girl if it would only kinda confuse her but she would be supportive?

2018-05-12 00:38:50,8iskrh,2,4,"*(sorry for posting same thing in a few trans subs, just hoping to get more opinions)*

In short I was suspecting it a couple years ago, then thought I was rather just ""atypical male"" but gave myself some freedom to explore being more feminine. Two weeks ago after another dream about looking and presenting as a girl and some dysphoria again, realized I still don't feel right about myself.

I've been thinking and reading a lot in last 2-3 weeks, I realized how much I lied to myself and that being male feels more like smth I can cope with rather then a way in which I can be truly happy and confident. My therapist agrees I have a gender problem and I also managed to relax a bit in feeling female (a bit hard to explain) and at those times I felt soo much better.

The thing is, I still feel like I oscillate. I understand it's all kinda me, it's just that I am not only used to but also worked hard to accept and feel good about myself while I thought I was male and I am kinda proud how far I got. I learned to stop trying to fit in (by being more masculine), I unlearned some things I was still thaught as a male (mostly problematic), and I felt like I finally respected myself and that others respect me too for some things I really am. So it's not that I hate it nor I feeel like rejecting my whole masculine side.
But then again a big part of my confidence, my emotions and who I really am felt so buried in my mind before I started accepting I might be trans. I thought I would need so many years to get to it and now a simple answer to everything pops up: ""You are a girl!"". But I get so emotional and excited that it's hard to stick to it for longer and I end up back in my regular self, not feeling much. Or I keep analyzing my thoughts and behaviour, afraid I am doing smth wrong or just imagining the whole thing bc of oscillations.ć. Like I will go back to ""normal"". But I'd rather not, it might be easier but at some point it gets to being unmotivated and like I might just choose suicide instead of coffe.

I am simply not sure what to expect, how 'should' I feel, what to do? The change itself also feels somehow strange now (I am 22y old). And that I might finally express what has been in my head like very personal stuff. I will get some clothes and makeup soon and hang out with friends as a girl but I am afraid how will I 'jump into' that, what if I just slip into feeling nothing?

I am 26, Male-to-Female. Several years into transition, Though I learned a couple years in that I’m also inter-sexed which adds complication I suppose. I’m afraid this is likely going to be a long read.

&amp;nbsp; 

Mother’s Day is rather hard on me, Struggling with my emotions. It brings up feelings of being hopeless, Worthless, incomplete. The idea of being broken beyond repair, questioning if it’s all even worth it. I never have a harder time fighting self harm than on mother’s day. My life didn’t decide it was enough for me to be Trans, Or to be inter-sexed. It found it proper to keep dumping things on me. Once upon a time I somewhat came to terms with my limitations, Accepted that someday I would look forward to adopting. Deep down it hurt more than I could put into words but I fought to move forward even if being infertile as a girl seemed like enough in my mind to justify dying. I have kept fighting, through severe abuse and struggle.

&amp;nbsp; 

 I’ve always had hypothyroidism, My endo always told me it was why even with estrogen I never saw much of a change with hrt, never got much breast development. More or less stayed the same really, I guess part of that I can credit to being inter-sexed, I’m thankful that I’ve always pretty much passed so that is nice. But my life didn’t see that as enough, A couple years ago I started having more severe health problems. I developed severe migraines, Like Really really bad. A particular variety of migraine referred to as “hemipelegic migraines”, Put simply it’s like your brain short circuiting. In addition to the usual pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound you can expect from a migraine I also get stroke like symptoms, Slurred speech, Confusion, Numbness and paralysis in my right side. Significant near blindness in my right eye. Being that I’m not uneducated in potential complications of hrt,,Like strokes I panicked the first time it happened, Cue the first trip to the ER for me. A CT scan, IV fluids and $2000 later..The diagnosis “migraines” and I was sent home with a prescription for the pain. A week later I collapsed at work with another one. This time someone called an ambulance for me. I wasn’t given the option to say no, so more bills and off to the ER with me once again. Same diagnosis, Except this time the dreadful news of stopping all HRT. I was horrified, crushed. But even after a few weeks of being hormone free I was still having these migraines. I eventually lost my job, Only to be sent of for another CT scan, And an MRI..Both of which came back clean. There was nothing “Wrong” with me, Just these awful experiences. They are miserable and frequent. They have kept me from working, or getting anything done. I ran out of money long before getting any sort of diagnosis as to why I have them and the neurologist I spoke to, by his tone didn’t believe I was having them. The good news is I now have a very supportive boyfriend whom I am grateful for. I have as much support as I could ask for. But deep down it makes this day hurt more.

It wasn’t until two years ago that it actually struck me, Mother’s day 2016. I had gotten over the fact I would never bare a child only now to realize that I will likely never get the opportunity to adopt either.
It’s been paralyzing dread, I should be on disability. I should apply for it, I should seek it out. But I don’t even know if I could qualify, I don’t have a diagnosis and I can’t even prove I have these dreadful things. As I am I will never be financially stable enough to support a child even if I could adopt...But if I were to seek out disability, I doubt I’d ever be able to adopt. Or even worse, If I have a diagnosis. Should my dream come true, medical science finally being progressive. that someday the option for me to bare a child presents it self, A diagnosis like “chronic hemiplegic migraine disorder” would disqualify me from ever experiencing the thing I want more than anything else. I struggle with every day but seem to make forward motion. I’m back on hormones which is it’s own small gift. And I’m now struggling to make ends meet as an artist working from home. But it’s barely enough to feed me, and I still suffer with multiple migraines a week. On normal days I get by, But On Mother’s Day...I realize that the thing I dreamed of since I was little, Will never come true. No matter how loving I am, How much I think I deserve it. I’m not fit to be a mother, No matter how much I tell my self it’s not my fault. The world has decided it will never happen. I will never have children of my own even if it warms my dreams every single night. I will never be stable enough to offer a safe home to any child through adoption.

I suppose I should probably start by introducing myself. Hi! I'm Alexandria, and I'm trans AMAB, and prefer she/her/hers pronouns, thank you very much. I'm 17 years old, 6 ft 2.5 in, have ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD, and started my journey of questioning my gender since January 2016. 


My earliest memory of any kind of ""confusion"" was when I was around 7 (2007, I guess the great thing about being born in 2000 is that the year is always my age). I had been playing around with makeup, and I had nail polish and lipstick on, and I remember feeling girly, and I remember liking it. My mom was going to Lifetime Fitness and she decided to take me with her, not knowing that I was all bedazzled up. When we arrived there, she looked back to the backseat, and I distinctly remember the look on her face when she saw me. Disapproval and scolding. She told me that I cant be going out looking like that and that boys aren't supposed to use makeup. I remember wanting to cry so badly, not understanding what was ever wrong with wanting to look girly. She made me take it all off before we went inside, and as the scent of acetone filled my nose, I started to cry. Not from the scent, but from what it meant, I guess. After that, there were other less significant ones like wanting to dress up with my step sisters but my dad saying no, wanting to do stereo-typically feminine things, and sometimes dressing up in my moms clothes when she wasn't home, and how good and cathartic it made me feel.


This all continued until middle school, where everyone started calling everything ""gay"" and didn't want to be negatively associated with all of that. I didn't have many friends and I was very self conscious about the way I looked, given I started puberty when I turned 12. Pimples everywhere. Hella voice drop. For reference, if anyone knows music stuff, my voice can hit an A1. Believe your eyes. A1. My normal talking voice now is around 90hz (something like an F#2), which is extremely dysphoric for me now, and has always been a source of anxiety for me, as I don't exactly like it. That summer I grew from 5 foot 5 in to 5 foot 11 in. I was the TALLEST 7th grader. I have stretch marks all over my butt, back, thighs, and knees. I can post pics of these if enough people request it. It looks like I got attacked by an animal XD.


I cut for the first time on December 22nd, 2015. My mom took me straight to the hospital. She was so upset with me, I remember. Everything was just getting to be too much. My mom has really high expectations of me. She got a 36 on her ACT (perfect score) and a 1500 something on her SAT (almost perfect) and had a 4.0 GPA throughout highschool and college. Her IQ is 146. I was starting to fall behind in school, and she reacted to this by taking away anything that made me feel happy. My phone, my DS lite, my free time with friends (including my girlfriend at the time), books, etc. She would then hover over me while i sit at the kitchen table trying to focus but to no avail, as medication can only do so much for my ADHD. I came out to her sometime around February 2016, and I came out as transgender. I remember her saying things like ""You dont need to be focusing on these things right now"" and ""You have plenty of time to figure this stuff out later, right now your priority needs to be school work"" and ""being.... that.... would make your life so much harder than it already is. You think you have it hard now, but you just wait and see"" and even going as far as to interrogate me (in the metaphorical sense) about why I think I'm trans. I didn't know how to answer. How does anyone answer that question? All I knew was that I was a girl, and I was being questioned on it. Right back into the closet I went. Anyhow, my realization that I was trans came in January 2016, after my girlfriend at the time said that she was pansexual. At this point, I felt comfortable enough to tell her that I used to dress up all the time (and still did occasionally), and she was very excited and supportive of this. She said that I might be trans, and I thought it sounded off but might be. She started using she/her/hers pronouns and I remember how right it felt. We went to her place after school one day and we dressed me up in her clothes and it made me so happy to share this with someone else. Another day (May 31st, 2016) we went onto her parents boat (who were very accepting of everything) and I went wearing trunks and a bikini. The feeling was amazing. People were around but nobody gave me looks (i guess i must have passed :), and I had no idea how good an article of clothing could ever make me feel. It wasn't long after, though, that she broke up with me. It was June 10th, and I had been accepted into an early college program just the night before. This was one of the first real anxiety attacks that I had because it would mean that I wouldn't get to see her anymore. We had both been suffering a lot from depression, and for her, anxiety too. Anyways, on the 10th (3 days before my birthday, mind you) she breaks up with me. She said I wasn't good for her mental health (which was true) and that it wasn't a healthy relationship (it really wasn't healthy). I had never loved someone as much as I loved her, trusted someone as much as her, and that moment is when my downward spiral started. I came home and my mom wouldn't be there for me. She told me (notice the reoccurring theme here) that there were ""more important things to be thinking about and putting my energy into"". I spilled my fucking heart out to her and cried alone in the fetal position in my bedroom with a pillow covering my ears as she screamed at me from outside of my door about how I'm an emotional mess and how I just need to suck it up and stop crying. I cut so deep that night that its still my biggest scar I have. My birthday came and went. Another day. No friends. Just me, alone, emotionally wrecked, and nothing but my own broad shoulders (which also made me dysphoric) to cry on. 


That summer came and went. I found out that she had cheated on me with a cis girl, and it killed me. I trusted her so much. Its been the main focus of every anxiety attack I've had since. Not being good enough (only exacerbated by my moms high expectations), constant fear of being cheated on, left. I was depressed the whole summer, and had been depressed until just about 1 month ago. Everything felt so fake. I cut every single night; it was the only way I could block out everything else. I became addicted to it, and after a while it became part of my every day routine. But even as a new hope loomed in the distance (going to my new school), I feared it was only a curse in disguise. I was so anxious about meeting all new people and having to make all new friends and it all just seemed so overwhelming. It was right around then that I got my license and a car, and a job at Target to pay for it all (more on this later!). 


First day. I decided to shed my old name (AJ, short for Alexander John) and go by Alex because it was more gender neutral. Over the summer, I was so fixated and obsessed with my old relationship that when i thought about all my gender issues, it all just seemed... I don't know. Blurred? I identified as gender fluid from September 2016 up until just about 2 months ago. I guess I knew deep down that I was a girl, but I really wanted to figure things out with my emotions and stuff and it was a lot easier to just be gender fluid. Something that I wasn't. Truth is, it wasn't easier. I was miserable. Again, still with the verbal abuse from my mom. Constant disappointment, taking away things that make me happy, etc.


But then a new ray of hope. A new girlfriend. She helped me stop cutting and is always there for me, even if she doesn't understand what I'm going through or why I'm feeling the way i am at a specific moment in time. I'm still with her today!!! We became a couple on January 31st, 2017. I let her know that I was genderfluid, but that didn't seem to bother her, despite the fact that she thought she was straight. Anyhow, its about then that i grew a beard. Not just any beard. Ill post a pic. It was enormous. I looked about 11 years older than I actually was. For me it was more of an experiment. Just to see what i was comfortable with. Problem is, I got a lot of positive reinforcement from it, and while that made me feel good about the way I looked, it isn't about what other people think. Deep down I guess I knew I was girl and many nights i spent my time crying and pulling at my face because I couldn't stand the way it felt. The next year went by alot better, and by February of 2018, I went to see a therapist and she referred me to a psychiatrist who upon hearing about all the things that I was going to told me that I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD. I was prescribed Lexapro, and we switched my ADHD medication, and ever since then, everything has been so much better and clearer. I came out to my girlfriend as trans, and she took it well, considering she didnt think she was straight. Apparently she's Panromantic and Heteroflexible (shes into boobs and femininity, but not the female version of the down there areas, which is totally fine because I like how things are down there too), and my coming out to her has opened her up to all of that. In the last 2 weeks, I came out to all of my school proximity associates and my teachers, my therapist, my one trans male friend, and Target. Target was just today. I told the HR rep, and he's going to tell most everybody for me. It feels really good to have such an amazing support team :).


But then there's my mom. I bet you can guess what she said when she came out to me if you very graciously took the time to read my life story XD. ""There are more important things to be focusing on right now"". Things are a little better, and she avoids pronouns, but still refuses to call me Alex. She's kinda a TERF.....


Anyways! That's where I am right now, doing voice training every single day and trying to avoid my mother at all costs. Thank you so much for reading if you did take the time to read all of that!! If you have any questions, Id be more than happy to answer! Have a wonderful days, ladies and gents and non binaries and aliens!


Sending love and support your way,

&amp;nbsp;

Like I said in my disclaimer, I need some help sorting this matter out in my mind. For a while now, I’ve felt some frustration with trans women and crossdressers/sissies being lumped together in the minds of cis people. For this post, I’m largely going to be focusing on trans women rather than trans men and non-binary people, because a) my experience is that of a tran’s woman, and b) because “”women’s things”” are almost always relegated to the women’s domain, whereas “”men’s things”” are more acceptable for everyone. I could explain this further, but that’s a whole other topic. Though I just want to recognize that their are AFAB crossdressers, and I invite everyone to share in discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

For as long as certain groups have been repressed, oppressors have used scare tactics to maintain their power. In the case of trans folk, cis people often make baseless and inflammatory accusations that trans people are perverts and predators, trying to invade spaces they don’t belong in order to take advantage of others. It’s offensive and infuriating to know that, with enough repetition, some people begin to believe these lies whether consciously or unconsciously.

&amp;nbsp;

For this reason, I’m particularly sensitive to having crossdressers and sissy fetishists grouped in with trans women, or even under the trans* umbrella as a whole. I admit some naiveté to the exact nature of crossdressers/sissies interests, but my understanding is that a big reason both are done is for sexual purposes—as kinks. Of course there are other reasons for crossdressing, like performance (as with drag) or preference of self expression deviating from gender norms, but by and large most accounts I’ve heard from crossdressers is about sexual thrill.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t think there’s any issue with crossdressing/sissy fetishism at all, for any reason; I think people should feel free to explore sexuality and kinks in safe and consensual ways. There is probably even some importance of trans people finding their gender identity through crossdressing and the like. My main discomfort is with CDs/sissies and trans people being grouped together by a cis/het/vanilla public at large, who often make no effort to differentiate one another when forming bigoted arguments against us.

#TL;DR—crossdressers ≠ trans women, plz stop grouping us together cis people.

So my questions are:

-Has anyone else felt this frustration?

-Am I being ridiculous?

-Should be more accepting of CDs under the trans* umbrella?

-How can I resolve my frustration?",trans,Misconceptions About Trans Folk and Crossdressers,1526350263.0,"{'created_utc': 1526325063, 'id': '8jeye4', 'num_comments': 40, 'score': 41, 'selftext': '#This thread is not intended to offend, invalidate, or disregard anybody.

But I'm talking to people who are in a place where therapy and HRT is available, but due to anxiety or other factors are considering a DIY method. 

I'm not going to discuss if I think DIY methods are effective or not either. That's not really something I know a lot about and a lot more intelligent people have written about that subject. 

That was all preface. Whew. That got wordy.

The other day I was looking at some of the sites I had bookmarked on an old PC relating to DIY hormones, before I decided to go the clinical route. I noticed many of the sites were gone, and of those that were not, many were not currently stocked. So I started poking around out of curiosity, and during that time a pretty big red flag went up. 

One thing about any method, is that it needs to be consistent. If you miss days individually it isn't bad but if you go a week or a month without your supplement things stop working. Almost all of these sites are sketchy. The ones that seem legit come and go, and are often out of stock. Getting a consistant supply with DIY methods seems tricky. I'm sure some people have managed it, or found a hail mary website, but going the clinical route is so much better. They take blood and make sure the doses are right, they aren't giving you placebos or only half of what you need (T-blockers are just as, if not more important. I take 2 100mg t-blockers a day and 2mg of estrogen, for reference). My therapist is awesome, and so was my doctor. Picking up my script once a month is easy, and visiting a doctor every 3 months is something you should maybe do anyways if you have insurance? 

Anyway, I know there are reasons DIY can be the only option. But if you happen to be lucky enough to have a choice... I really recommend the clinical way of doing things.

I posted a couple of times recently about being intersex and I have to say that you all made me feel so welcome and respected - so thank you so much :) 
As I said before I am absolutely an ally, I don’t identify as trans, I identify (and was brought up as) female with certain intersex aspects (although physically I’m very obviously female etc). I’ve struggled with gender dysphoria and issues with my body image mainly because of my enlarged clitoris, which I’ve just had reduced and it’s made such a huge difference to my mental health (see previous post!) 
The only remaining thing that causes me dysphoria is my boobs. I’m slim/average sort of weight (5ft3 and about 9 stone), I’ve got hips and a bum that I’m confident about and not a big stomach. But my boobs are tiny, and sort of child like in form. I sort of feel like my entire body would be far better proportioned if I had bigger boobs, or at least with a more mature shape. The docs have said it’s basically not going to change and I’ve even asked them for E but they said it probably won’t make a difference because I’ve already had oestrogen throughout my life and my boobs have basically decided what shape they’re going to be etc. 
I know this sounds like a really minor issue and I’m probably in a very privileged position compared to what a lot of trans people go through but it does still cause me dysphoria so I hope you understand that :)

2018-05-17 14:06:38,8k4ic4,19,43,"A little backstory: I used to play pathfinder (Like Dungeons and Dragons/D&amp;D) with this group of people, and it was a blast. Things ended up sorta falling apart just before I came out because we lost our DM. I came out to them anyway, and their reactions were... less than thrilling. One of them was adamant about ""calling it like I see it"" which made me feel uncomfortable to be around him at all anymore. Another member, let's call her V, was just like ""I don't understand why you'd want to [insert transphobic bullshit here]"", and it's worth pointing out that she's really masculine and works in a field that consists primarily of men, and Idk. She just doesn't get it. But I've explained several times that I'm absolutely 100% a woman.

Well, she came into my store the other day, which happens but not often, and we talked. I mentioned that I have a wife now, and said ""Well, I am gay"" and she immediately asked when I started dating men. 

Ummm, I didn't, nor have I ever? I'm gay, I'm a woman, which makes me a lesbian, V. I still strictly like women. She changed subjects and asked me if I've ""had my penis cut off yet"". Now, I've explained this to her before, that that is NOT how that works at all. Not even close. 

I made my excuse to get back to work and I felt really shitty for a little bit after, but it's been in the back of my mind ever since. It's just made me feel like I don't pass, even though I taught myself vocal training and have a cis passing voice, no one else questions my validity as a woman, and I only get sir'd maybe 2-3% of the time.

Things ended up sorta falling apart just before I came out because we lost our DM. I came out to them anyway, and their reactions were... less than thrilling. One of them was adamant about ""calling it like I see it"" which made me feel uncomfortable to be around him at all anymore. Another member, let\'s call her V, was just like ""I don\'t understand why you\'d want to [insert transphobic bullshit here]"", and it\'s worth pointing out that she\'s really masculine and works in a field that consists primarily of men, and Idk. She just doesn\'t get it. But I\'ve explained several times that I\'m absolutely 100% a woman.\n\nWell, she came into my store the other day, which happens but not often, and we talked. I mentioned that I have a wife now, and said ""Well, I am gay"" and she immediately asked when I started dating men. \n\nUmmm, I didn\'t, nor have I ever? I\'m gay, I\'m a woman, which makes me a lesbian, V. I still strictly like women. She changed subjects and asked me if I\'ve ""had my penis cut off yet"". Now, I\'ve explained this to her before, that that is NOT how that works at all. Not even close. \n\nI made my excuse to get back to work and I felt really shitty for a little bit after, but it\'s been in the back of my mind ever since.

So here are my questions:

1) I know I can start HRT just by going to my local Planned Parenthood that uses the informed consent model, BUT I was wondering if doing so would make getting surgery more difficult later on. Not physically(HRT is HRT), but legally. Like, would I be more likely to be denied surgery, since I didn’t get evaluated by a therapist? 

2) Should I even try to get a therapist? Do they make the process of transitioning any easier legally(getting surgery, changing legal documents to reflect gender, etc.)? 

3) Could not going through a therapist effect how my insurance would or wouldn’t cover any of my medical expenses? I know this relies on which insurance I have, but just generally speaking. Do most insurance companies care if you follow a path laid out by a therapist, or not?

For me, the whole period thing growing up was a mystery. My mom had a talk with me one day that I would starting bleeding monthly and that all girls go through it. I initially thought “no that will never happen to me” and I never really felt like a girl. It’s like I just thought if I distanced myself mentally from being a girl I wouldn’t get a period.
Then I did. And honestly it was terrible. It was like “oh... my mom was right, I guess I am a girl after all.” Since then I have sort of “accepted” that this is just something my body does to stay healthy, as foreign and disconnecting as it is. My dysphoria really comes from social things, my voice, my hips, and not so much my chest cause my breasts are very small (thankfully), and my hair, as it is the first and immediate giveaway that screams to the world that I am a girl even though I am really not.

My mom had a talk with me one day that I would starting bleeding monthly and that all girls go through it. I initially thought “no that will never happen to me” and I never really felt like a girl. It’s like I just thought if I distanced myself mentally from being a girl I wouldn’t get a period.\nThen I did. And honestly it was terrible. It was like “oh... my mom was right, I guess I am a girl after all.” Since then I have sort of “accepted” that this is just something my body does to stay healthy, as foreign and disconnecting as it is. My dysphoria really comes from social things, my voice, my hips, and not so much my chest cause my breasts are very small (thankfully), and my hair, as it is the first and immediate giveaway that screams to the world that I am a girl even though I am really not.

 My wife is from California and we both live in AZ (in my home town) and while my old doc (third I've had out here due to issues with the other doctors) was recklessly overdosing me, not hearing my emotional and hormonal concerns, being completely unreachable for 6 months at a time, denying that there was anything we could do but put more and more Spiro into my system and raise my cortisol levels dangerously, making me a stressed out mess, I was losing my mind.

My WIFE on the other hand still video chatted with her out of state doctor who like...helped her. There were so many other options for my regimine and when I brought them up to my doctor she'd say something like 'well I use the original handbook for this and it doesn't call for any of that'

This resulted in me becoming so stressed from my cortisol levels and so depressed and angry from essentially going through a month long period every 30 days that I lost one of my jobs and was scaring my wife. It felt like I was turning back into the person I used to be, minus the outdated gender. Didn't I used to be happier? Calmer, since I came out? What happened?

WELL, I talked to her doc, who after getting all the details about my treatment, was appalled at what she was hearing. We have a plan to even out the periods, got me onto a T blocker with none of the side effects of spiro while we ween me off of it, and assured me that if I had any concerns, we'd look into fixing it. She said my emotions were valid and my health was important and should be taken seriously. With the new dosages and pills, I'm feeling immensely better already.

I never questioned my gender until about 6 months ago. I literally never considered it. But after leaving the all-boys secondary school I attended and now being in university living with and mostly associating with women, I’ve been assaulted by the thought that I want to be a girl almost constantly. I don’t really know what it is that I want: I can’t tell if I hate being a guy for example. When I look at myself in the mirror I’m not exactly overcome with horror or anything but I find it a little bit hard to really like what I’m seeing. Like, if someone looked like me I’d think they were fairly attractive. But for me theres something “off”. Maybe, I’m not sure. 

Similarly, I have an abstract idea that I’d love to wear traditionally feminine clothing, but I always default to very anonymous generic masc clothing because I don’t really feel like I know where to start. I know I’m bi, but whenever I imagine myself being in a relationship with a woman I think of us as lesbians (if that makes sense). My feelings towards both men and women are gay, somehow. Sorry if that’s a stupid thing to say. 

I think a lot of these thoughts first came about when I started following a bunch of trans women on Twitter. I felt like I was approaching something I needed when I spectated them, if that makes sense. Like they where on a path in life I also wanted to be on. 

All this said, I don’t feel like I really fully fit the bill for being a trans woman. I don’t think of myself as a woman (not now anyway) and I’m still not sure if a lot of this is a brief phase that’s come about just because I’m experiencing a lot of new things after having moved away from my parents.

2018-05-28 06:10:25,8mnxke,3,5,"Hello there, I'm an average American non-politically affiliated person. I just want to have a little rant about the trans bathroom debate in a place that might appreciate how I've felt about this topic for a while.

Now while I understand that it's a deep and important topic for you, I do not understand how you feel, how *much* it means to you, or anything to that degree, because I'm not trans, so I simply cannot really ""get it"". 

That being said, as an outsider, viewing this from the perspective of someone who generally spends their time observing the stupidity of all facets of American and world culture, I have a great feeling of...I think irritation might be the word for what I feel about this debate. I feel very, very irritated that in 2018, we are having huge public debates, that ultimately boil down to ""We do not want you to shit *here*."". It is incredibly irritating that with all the things in the world that are going on right now, which bathroom a person is allowed to dump their ass in is a *HOT* issue in most areas of this country. I understand that this is also about acknowledging that you are what you identify as as well, but the simple fact that society has such an issue with where you shit is unbelievable to me. The excuses I've heard have ranged from religious persecution (by the way, former southern baptist here, raised by a preacher, and I'm thinking Jesus either didn't care, or forgot to make rules about transgender people, because there's nothing there), the oh so popular ""*It* shouldn't be given special rights."", and of course ""I don't want a pervert around my children/I don't want to be in a bathroom with a man. He might rape me."". So I'd like to focus on that last one. 


If a guy is so ballsy that he's willing to rape a woman in a public bathroom, letting trans people into the bathrooms isn't going to matter one way or the other. Same with molesting little girls. Generally that happens when there are only the assaulter and the assaulted in the bathroom. They aren't going to do it with a crowd of people in there. So anything to do with rape or sexual assault is a moot point in the trans bathroom debate. If a rapist is really that motivated, trans or not, they're going to go into whatever bathroom and do it. No legislation is going to change that. Also a man might try to say that he is trans afterwards as if that was some kind of defense, but that's just the coyote trying desperately to chew it's arm off and get out of this. 

Also as a side note, the prominent bathroom sexual assaults are men against young boys. Nobody gives a fuck about that though. It doesn't fit into the conservative/regressive agenda, so it's not an issue worth discussing.

I just want to have a little rant about the trans bathroom debate in a place that might appreciate how I\'ve felt about this topic for a while.\n\nNow while I understand that it\'s a deep and important topic for you, I do not understand how you feel, how *much* it means to you, or anything to that degree, because I\'m not trans, so I simply cannot really ""get it"". \n\nThat being said, as an outsider, viewing this from the perspective of someone who generally spends their time observing the stupidity of all facets of American and world culture, I have a great feeling of...I think irritation might be the word for what I feel about this debate. I feel very, very irritated that in 2018, we are having huge public debates, that ultimately boil down to ""We do not want you to shit *here*."". It is incredibly irritating that with all the things in the world that are going on right now, which bathroom a person is allowed to dump their ass in is a *HOT* issue in most areas of this country. I understand that this is also about acknowledging that you are what you identify as as well, but the simple fact that society has such an issue with where you shit is unbelievable to me. The excuses I\'ve heard have ranged from religious persecution (by the way, former southern baptist here, raised by a preacher, and I\'m thinking Jesus either didn\'t care, or forgot to make rules about transgender people, because there\'s nothing there), the oh so popular ""*It* shouldn\'t be given special rights."", and of course ""I don\'t want a pervert around my children/I don\'t want to be in a bathroom with a man. He might rape me."". So I\'d like to focus on that last one. \n\n\nIf a guy is so ballsy that he\'s willing to rape a woman in a public bathroom, letting trans people into the bathrooms isn\'t going to matter one way or the other. Same with molesting little girls. Generally that happens when there are only the assaulter and the assaulted in the bathroom. They aren\'t going to do it with a crowd of people in there. So anything to do with rape or sexual assault is a moot point in the trans bathroom debate. If a rapist is really that motivated, trans or not, they\'re going to go into whatever bathroom and do it. No legislation is going to change that. Also a man might try to say that he is trans afterwards as if that was some kind of defense, but that\'s just the coyote trying desperately to chew it\'s arm off and get out of this. \n\nAlso as a side note, the prominent bathroom sexual assaults are men against young boys. Nobody gives a fuck about that though. It doesn\'t fit into the conservative/regressive agenda, so it\'s not an issue worth discussing. \n\nSo yeah, I just wanted to rant on this topic, because I am so irritated that society still fucks with you all in every way possible.

when i was young i thought i was trans.
i’m not.
biologically i am female, but in a sexual context i like to be addressed as a male? ik that is super fucking weird. idk if this is some weird transphobic kink... i like hearing ‘good boy’ but not ‘good girl,’ all that stuff, but in social everyday life i’m find with being addressed with a female name and being treated as female and i think of myself as female. once i start thinking about sex i sometimes get dysphoria and feel like i should have a penis. also when thinking about sex i like the thought of having another male name.
maybe it had something to do with the fact that i used to think i was ftm? idk.
does anyone else experience this?

2018-05-31 13:42:46,8nii6m,8,20,"I'm wondering if things will get ""easier"" as I immerse myself in the trans world. 

31 days ago I had the realization and acceptance, laying awake in bed, almost midnight, I should have been asleep, but instead my mind was racing and my depression was eating away at me when I finally connected the dots, finally allowed my mind to entertain the thought that I might actually be trans and I couldn't run from it anymore. 

Today is my first therapy appointment.

When I called in to schedule it one week after the day I realized, I was so anxious just to get in there and start moving along. When they told me they couldn't see me until the end of the month I started to panic, I thought of finding another therapist, or taking time off work to get an earlier appointment. I didn't know how I'd find peace with myself in the next 20 days. I needed to start moving, I'd finally accepted it, finally started gaining momentum, I couldn't lose it or I knew how easy it would be to slip back into denial and acceptance. 

Well guess what happened in those 20 days? 

Yup, slipped back into denial. 

Today the reality is hitting me...or not hitting me. I feel disconnected from the world, it's still like this is all fake and I can just keep ignoring it and it will go away. My brain's going, ""What are you doing, this isn't you, you don't do things like this, you're just a regular guy, not trans at all. Cancel the appointment. You don't need this!"" 

I'm not used to taking my time with things. I'm all or nothing. But I can't do that here. Can't be like, ""Sign me up for dick removal tomorrow or I'll stay a man for life."" 

I'm not good at this. 

A month ago I wanted to come out to the world just to get it off my chest. I wanted to tell my family and close friends, or make a facebook post, I just wanted to get all the bad things over with so I could move forward. 

Now as the reality sinks in I just want to escape it again. But I know what that would mean. I'm 28 and I don't want to be the 40 year old who comes on r/trans to tell people not to wait until you're 40 and married to make the change.

I attend a college full-time through a dual-credit program. While there are several gender-neutral restrooms here, they are few and far between, and nowhere near any of my classrooms. All indoor restrooms are gendered. 

My issue is that I continue to be uncomfortable in the women's restroom. However, it is also what I've been used to for my whole life. I want to use the men's room, but in public, I only pass with strangers something like 30-40% of the time.
