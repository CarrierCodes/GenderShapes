I'm MtF and like for many trans people my end goal of transition was becoming basically cis. It was a very unhealthy obsession. I had to always measure myself against other women. First steps are easy, to look like them, to move like them, to talk like them.

&amp;#x200B;

But then a cis girl talks to me about sex and I freak out, since I have no idea how girls talk to each other about this stuff. What role do  they think they have in a relationship? For my whole life I've seen the  whole world from a patriarchal perspective and never had those forming  years as a teenage girl to find my place in it. Heck, after 3 years of  living as a women I still don't understand why girls want to be with  men, who are stronger than them, have a more privileged placed in  society and are too often potential abusers.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is talk about a first period, which I never had and never will. Tampons, pads and comfort routine during menstruation are a part  of this secret women world I'll never be a part of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is motherhood. I cried more than I could count because  I'll never be a mother. I don't even want kids anymore but still can't hear people talking about babies without experiencing trauma. 

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, SRS. I had my first appointment with a doctor and I'll have it done soon. Boy, is this one is a huge can of worms. I'll need to  regularly stretch it, because my body will reject it and try to heal  over it. I'll have to carefully and frequently wash it, because it  cannot clean itself like in cis women. I'll need to always use lube during sex, because there won't be any natural lubrication like in cis women. And what hurt me the most, I'll lack muscles controlling it, so  even on the surface it won't function the same.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how hard I'll try, I'll always be a worse cis women, there will be something that I lack or don't understand on emotional level. It  was devastating and drove me into a terrible depression. As an enby, it also caused suppression of my identity, so gradual that I honest to God forgot I was one. Only after therapy I remembered who I was and started to get better.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is a good ending to this story and I hope it'll be the ending for anyone, who was in the same dark place as I was. I just stopped worrying about being cis, which I'll never be, and embraced being trans, which I always was. Cis women have their own shared experiences and  shared thoughts. We, trans women, have ours.

&amp;#x200B;

I was trying to be accepted as one of them and even when I had that acceptance, I always felt like a stranger. I finally found peace when I realized i was one of us all along.

&amp;#x200B;

MtF are not worse cis women. FtM are not worse cis man. We are different and beautiful and valid. If you feel good with yourself the way you are, great, I'm so glad for you.

I take her with a grain of salt, as you should too. The discussion was about ADHD. Someone mentioned how it can have overlap with other mental health issues and I mentioned that there have been studies about overlap with PCOS and ADHD. Now, some of you may know how being trans and having such a condition can be hard, confusing, and frustrating. Some may not, but that's ok. Being trans has it's ups and downs, and other conditions just make those downs more sucky at times, but that's life. 

 If you're curious to the studies, simply google ""ADHD PCOS.""

Why is this relevant to this sub? Well, Im trans. I have ADHD and PCOS. Oh, and being both trans and having pcos can get confusing and frustrating. Essentially, you're struggling with you gender dysphoria and you discover that you have this medical condition that fucks with your sex hormones. Now, are your feelings about your gender no longer valid because you have a hormone disorder that increases androgen levels and decreases estrogen? If you didn't have it, would you feel the way you do or do you feel the way you do only because that's part of the disorder? Can a hormone imbalance essentially make someone trans? Am I no longer valid as a transperson? What about if this is an intersex condition? Are intersex people not valid in the trans community? Do they really count since they are technically not cis?

PCOS is very relevant to my trans experience. The above is a snapshot of some of things I struggled with in the past or present. 

Being mixed race resulted in me being rejected by both ethnic communities. So, when it comes to queer communities, is that something Im going to have to face here as well? Am I truly valid? The answer to myself is 'yes,' whereas the answer to naysayers is 'idgaf if you disagree. Imma be me'

2018-09-03 17:44:16,9cniwy,7,11,"Hey, I should start by introducing myself, I'm 19, AFAB, and have some stuff going on my mind about gender and such.
I have started to suspect that I might be trans  last summer, I thought about it a lot for a few months, doing research etc.. and kind of conclude that Im just a masculine girl and stopped thinking about it until recently. I got a short haircut, felt very masculine, and this is coming back. (Oh and sorry for my poor English)

Some history about myself. My parents told me stories from when I was little, I refused to play with Barbies, wear dresses.. then later (6-10) I was a real tomboy, short hair, boy clothes, i lived in the countryside and played almost only with boys (and I still find it easier to befriend guys), people thought I was one and I was amused by it, but I was jealous that I couldn't do some stuff like being shirtless. I clearly remember having a dream where I had a penis and told my parents about it. (I guess I was a weird kid).

But then puberty hit, I started to dress more ""girly"" (because that's what you're supposed to do) and I hated shopping with my mom, couldn't find comfortable clothes in the girl section, I tried to be like the other girls but wasn't very good at it. I had a enormous lack of self confidence, especially with my image (I had a few difficult years where I had no friends and was constantly bullied, I was the ugly lonely kid, probably, still affect me in some ways). 
I discovered that I liked girls around 14 I guess, never was a big deal for me, felt natural.

I don't remember how and when I started to know about trans stuff, but I recognized myself in some aspects, not everything though, and that's where my doubts come from.
For example, I have pretty big breasts and it feels better wearing a sports bra to flatten it (not as much as I'd like to though), the normal bras feels weird but I still wear it sometimes because the other hurt my back. I don't hate them, just wish they were smaller so I can bind (I'm really thinking about buying a binder). I also don't hate my genitals but I wouldn't mind not having my periods and being able to pee standing! 
Concerning hrt, I can't even imagine having a deep voice or facial hair, I don't know how I feel about that. 

So it sounds like I don't really experience gender dysphoria, I'm not comfortable when people insist on how I am a girl, and so I should be like this, being called madam.. but that doesn't mean anything. I feel better with my hair short, more confident. I love wearing ""boy clothes"" with my sport bra, I would also like to try on men's underwear, but I don't know how to do it discretely.. I hate it when people (like my parents) tell me to try to be more feminine ""why don't you try makeup, I'm sure you would look great!"" ""Just for once wear a dress, I would be so happy"" that kind of thing.. but maybe I just hate everything girly because I disagree with what society wants women to be like..
I thought about non-binaries identities, and I guess agender would fit me best, but I'm not really comfortable with the word, feels like it's missing something.

Sorry I guess this is the typical kind of story that you see here all the time, but maybe this could help me see things clearer, just hearing stories about people in my situation. Do I look like an egg in denial?

I also posted this to the Whirlpool forum looking for an answer.

**TLDR version:** Does anyone know what BDM-Victoria considers to be acceptable reasons for a change of surname?

**Details:**

Hi, I'm a transgender woman who's been presenting full time now for over a year now. Last week I finally got around to putting in my name change application and I'm pretty excited about it. I didn't expect this email, however:

&gt;""During the assessment of your application, the reason you have provided for the change of name has been deemed unsatisfactory. You are requested to provide further clarity as to the reasons for the change of name, surname &gt;!censored!&lt;. Please complete a statutory declaration as to why you are requesting a change of name and any reasons behind the name you have nominated to change into.""

On my application, where I was asked to provide a reason for my name change, I simply put that I was transgender and no longer wish to be known by my former names. I can see that this reason doesn't necessarily line up with my desire to change my last name – but as I didn't think it would be an issue I kept my answer short.

The long explanation is that I spent a long time looking at different names both first and last with only one suitable candidate that I wasn't 100% sold on, so I decided, at least for now, to stick with Dannii, which is what I've been called since starting my transition.

Dannii is already very close to my birth name, Daniel, and I was hesitant taking it on for that reason. I need some more distance from my old name. It makes me cringe every time I hear Dannii in conjunction with my last name. It isn't unusual for transgender people to change their surname as they make a fresh start.

Surnames are essentially genderless, but other than this, I'm honestly not sure what the big deal is, or even if it's a big deal at all. Do you really need a ""good"" reason, or is it that my given reason simply didn't line up? What if you just really didn't like your surname, would that be enough?

Anyway, I REALLY don't want to get my application denied, nor can I afford to go through the process again so I thought I'd come here to see how other trans-people in Victoria went about changing their last name or if anyone knows what BDM-Victoria considers to be acceptable reasons for a change of surname.

Womanhood comes with the occurrence of a naturally female body, natural female puberty, female anatomy, in the vast majority of cases gynecological considerations like conditions pertaining to having a vagina, pregnancy, years spent actively preventing or actively seeking pregnancy, a menstrual cycle, breasts (no matter the size), a natural cocktail of hormones that cause their own set of tendencies and actual ""feelings"" of womanhood, etc.

I’m in my first week of college and I think I might be MTF trans. Idk if this is the right sub to put this on. I only just started thinking something was up maybe two years ago. More and more increasingly, I find myself wanting to wear makeup or try on a dress. I want to feel feminine and this is all really scary to me because I’ve always identified as a cis guy but I’ve been questioning it a lot lately. I’m definitely rambling right now but I just need to get it out somehow. I’m not some athletic tough guy, I love feeling femme but I just feel like I’m having a bit of an identity crisis. My college is super progressive about LGBTQ+ issues but my hometown is pretty conservative. My family is accepting but even they don’t know because I’m still terrified of anyone else knowing besides myself. The only other person that knows I’ve been having these feelings is my ex girlfriend. \nI just don’t know anymore.

2018-09-09 00:45:11,9e92eb,7,61,"Just wanted to share... 

I’ve been out for about a year and I’ve always felt awkward about my gender when it comes to her. I came out to her pretty soon after my mother/her aunt died and it was hard on her. There was a lot going on for both of us and I didn’t get to talk through it with her the way I wanted to. Also I felt guilty about “taking away” another female role model (I’m ftm) even though that’s ridiculous.

She went through a phase maybe six months ago where everything was entrenched in gender roles. Girls couldn’t be pirates. Myself and my Dad couldn’t vacuum, wash dishes. (“If we don’t do it, who’s going to?” I asked. Never mind that my mother was the businesswoman and I can’t remember ever seeing her do either.) I was heartbroken, but I knew it couldn’t be innate, and my Dad and I eventually got it out of her that a father of a friend was filling her head with this bullshit. We talked to her, and her parents, and she’s way better now.


Today she finally asked me *questions* about it. I’ve told her several times if she wants to ask, she can, but out of the blue today she just said, “Why did you want to become a boy?” (amusingly, mid conversation about her male classmates, who sound like maniacs. Idk what their parents are doing. I understand your confusion, cuz.) I parroted the “I’ve always been a boy, it was everyone else who was confused or didn’t know,” that I say whenever she mentions that I “used to be a girl,” and then she asked a question that I found much more exciting and interesting: “How did you know?”


“I just know.” I said. “How do you know you’re a girl?”


She thought on this for a while, and then answered; “I have long hair. But you had long hair, how did you know?”


“Well, everyone else thought I was a girl, so they told me I should have long hair. But I’ve had short hair for a long time now. Besides, I know lots of boys with long hair. Your Uncle used to have long hair!”


She nodded at this, but still seemed kinda like she was grasping the concept. I added;


“Also, if you cut your hair short, you would still know you’re a girl, right?” 


She answered yes.


“It’s exactly like that!”


I swear I saw her eyes light up like “OH!”


I love her so much, she’s always been a staunch defender of my pronouns and chosen name, the first to jump to correct someone. I’m just so happy we finally had a convo about it. If anyone else is struggling with younger family members, let them know you’re open to questions and give them time. They might surprise you.

I hope you don't mind me picking your brains a bit. I have a number of trans friends already, but many of them came out before I met them so I didn't really need to get used to ""new"" names and pronouns much (their new was always there, from my perspective). My (cis AFAB/31) older sibling (trans AMAB/33/she/they) just came out to my family as trans. They've still got some exploration to do in terms of gender, names, etc, so we're still in the very early days of this, and there could be multiple try-on names or pronouns in the coming months/years... And I've had my entire life to get used to the wrong ones. Consequently it feels like more of a big deal to get it right, be validating, not screw up their pronouns, etc. 

So... What do you wish your siblings knew when you came out to them? What gaffes did they make that might have been preventable? Feel free to focus on siblings who mean well and accept that you are the expert on your own gender (or not, if you want to vent - that's fine too).

I'm especially curious about the best way to handle talking about our shared history - many of our experiences together, I've experienced as times with my ""brother"" when he was a ""young boy,"" and I'm not sure how to handle the mismatch between the gender associated with those memories and the correct gender of the person as they understand it now.

My NP was exactly like this - I actually found it odd during the meeting that she didn't tell me to aspirate and I asked and she said ""well, yes, you can do that, but you'll almost never hit a vein if you're injecting in the right spot so it's kind of unnecessary."" so for my first couple of shots, I didn't. Nonetheless, I had always been a little paranoid about that scenario.

A couple weeks after my first shot, I was talking to another trans friend. He mentioned to me that he had developed a phobia of self-injecting ever since he pinned a vein and bled all down his leg and it freaked him out. He said he knew as soon as he stuck it in and started moving the plunger down that it was very wrong because it hurt way more than normal. sure enough, vein. he's lucky he only ended up pushing a minute amount before stopping. since then he always has his boyfriend inject him in the glute.

so about a month later, I was doing my shot. I jabbed in as usual but I noticed it hurt way more. I remembered what my friend had described. I pulled the plunger back and sure enough there was a bead of blood in there. I grabbed a cotton ball and held it there for a minute after withdrawing the needle + put a band-aid over the cotton ball keeping it still pressed against my skin in case the scab opened up and then re-stuck myself in a different spot (ideally should have used a fresh needle but I was running a little low on them - the new injection ended up going fine, not even bruised). if I hadn't already had my cotton balls and Band-Aids all at the ready I probably would have gotten a fair amount of blood on the floor, and if I had ignored the pain, not aspirated, and just injected anyway, who knows what would have happened (not good things)!

takeaways:

1. always aspirate, every time
3. always keep cotton balls/band-aids ready
2. your dose should still be good to inject even after aspirating a little blood - it's your own blood, it's only a biohazard to other people, not you. just try to squeeze as much of the blood out so you don't leave a nasty bruise. the blood stays in a little droplet at the bottom of the syringe since the medicine is oleaginous and it's easy to separate back off.
3. ideally use a new needle after sticking yourself because the tip actually dulls after using it once and needles are very cheap
4. don't panic, you can just try again, you won't die or even seriously injure yourself as long as you aspirate every time and don't be hasty.",trans,PSA for self-injection: always aspirate your syringe,1536939273.0,"{'created_utc': 1536914073, 'id': '9fqapd', 'num_comments': 20, 'score': 35, 'selftext': 'so I\'ve heard that a lot of doctors/NPs doing instructional visits for how to self-administer shots (be it for T or for E - that\'s actually irrelevant in this case) neglect to teach you to aspirate the needle backwards before pushing the plunger down. \n\nMy NP was exactly like this - I actually found it odd during the meeting that she didn\'t tell me to aspirate and I asked and she said ""well, yes, you can do that, but you\'ll almost never hit a vein if you\'re injecting in the right spot so it\'s kind of unnecessary."" so for my first couple of shots, I didn\'t.

2018-09-14 20:21:03,9fvgjb,12,2,"I won’t bore you with the long paragraph so I’ll just get straight to it. I crossed dressed when I was younger, wore my moms makeup and such. During my teens I experienced a phase where I called myself “trans-curios”. I wouldn’t say I’m masculine at all, I’m totally soft and mushy on the inside to the point it hurts. I somehow find myself in that same phase again and I’ve realized a few things and wanted to know your thoughts cause I’m not fully convinced I’m trans since I haven’t been evaluated by a professional plus I have yet to see a tans “coming of age” story that is similar to my own. So as to make things simpler I made a list: 

1. I feel out of place in my body. I may have supposedly been born with a neuromuscular disorder according to my parents but I always viewed myself as a much smaller more petite version of myself. I kinda envy androgynous guys since they can easily pass as females if they wanted to. If I could switch bodies I would definitely be a petite blonde. I’d kill to know what that’s like.

2. Me having a penis is kind of gross. Like what am I supposed to do with it? It’s s kinda like a square peg round whole type situation. I don’t mind it, it just seems like so much of a hassle to have and use.

3. Whenever I watch porn I find myself being envious of the female instead of the guy. Theirs just something about the female presence that is envious.

4. I’ve been looking into ways of subtly dressing more feminine. I want to paint my nails and learn how to do my makeup if possible. I’d love to learn how to do winged eyeliner.

5. I LOVE being pampered, I wish I could do it all the time! I’d love to get my nails done and go shopping whatnot. I detest typical guy stuff, I hate drinking and fighting. I just want to stay home with my spouse and cuddle.

6. I want to try living like a woman at least once in my life. I’m afraid to cause I’m surrounded by the wrong people but if I could get away to a new place and feel just for one day what it’s like to go out as a woman that would be amazing.

I crossed dressed when I was younger, wore my moms makeup and such. During my teens I experienced a phase where I called myself “trans-curios”. I wouldn’t say I’m masculine at all, I’m totally soft and mushy on the inside to the point it hurts. I somehow find myself in that same phase again and I’ve realized a few things and wanted to know your thoughts cause I’m not fully convinced I’m trans since I haven’t been evaluated by a professional plus I have yet to see a tans “coming of age” story that is similar to my own. So as to make things simpler I made a list: \n\n1. I feel out of place in my body. I may have supposedly been born with a neuromuscular disorder according to my parents but I always viewed myself as a much smaller more petite version of myself. I kinda envy androgynous guys since they can easily pass as females if they wanted to. If I could switch bodies I would definitely be a petite blonde. I’d kill to know what that’s like.\n\n2. Me having a penis is kind of gross. Like what am I supposed to do with it? It’s s kinda like a square peg round whole type situation. I don’t mind it, it just seems like so much of a hassle to have and use.\n\n3. Whenever I watch porn I find myself being envious of the female instead of the guy. Theirs just something about the female presence that is envious.\n\n4. I’ve been looking into ways of subtly dressing more feminine. I want to paint my nails and learn how to do my makeup if possible. I’d love to learn how to do winged eyeliner.\n\n5. I LOVE being pampered, I wish I could do it all the time! I’d love to get my nails done and go shopping whatnot. I detest typical guy stuff, I hate drinking and fighting. I just want to stay home with my spouse and cuddle.\n\n6. I want to try living like a woman at least once in my life. I’m afraid to cause I’m surrounded by the wrong people but if I could get away to a new place and feel just for one day what it’s like to go out as a woman that would be amazing.

I still have a photo of us on our first day of highschool, at a junior high dance, playing dnd at my birthday party, etc..
Point is, this guy is a pretty solid fixture in my life. He's weird, and I may not like it sometimes, but he's my rock. He's always there to tell me to get off my ass when I fall down. 

Recently, as I came out a couple months ago, I've been attempted to present as a female. He was fine with my coming out, but is seemingly *not* fine with my new demeanor and appearance. He refuses to use my preferred name and pronouns. His reasoning being he met me as ""the boy"" not ""the girl"". It's weird for him to suddenly start calling me a girl, he says, which I understand. 

More alarmingly, he's said some pretty hurtful things to me. Like when I wore makeup the first time at school, he looked at me and asked, ""What's that faggot shit on your face?"". He's said similar comments about different things as well. Maybe he's joking, but it still *really* hurts. Especially coming from my best friend. I see him every day at school and at work, and I don't know what to do, because now all I can think about when I see him is how he'll probably think I'm a freak when I transition. 
And what happens when I finally look and sound like a *girl*, but he refers to me as a *boy*? Again, not only is that just really hurtful to me and it makes me dysphoric, but it could also put me in *real* danger, outing me like that (I'm not joking. I live in the deep South for fucks sake)

2018-09-20 15:57:08,9hggbg,11,30,"Idk where to begin tbh. Just a forewarning, I suck at TLDRs so if this ends up becoming a long thread I apologize, but I appreciate it if you take your time reading this.

Only just a few months ago, I came to the conclusion that I am bi. I am AMAB 21. It was difficult to accept even though I never have had any dislike towards the LGBT community. Since then I had questioned my gender. Was I really a man? Were there any signs I might have missed out on? These thoughts had me confused for quite some time as I was trying to figure things out. Even now, after saying to myself I am NB, do I still feel cognitive dissonance about it.

I’ll be honest, I took those “what gender am I” quizzes to see if that would help. Whether I did it to confirm my own feelings, I cannot say for certain. The answer I got felt - right. And yet I can’t shake the notion I might be lying to myself. I currently identify as Androgyne, the halfway/mix between man and woman, including the mix of masculinity and femininity.

To put it into perspective, I can give you some examples from when I was younger that one might say made me an “egg”. I had to be around 4 or so. I was with my mom and we were playing together doing whatever parents do with their 4 year olds. According to my mom, as I don’t remember this happening, she told me (when I was older) that I had told her I was a girl and I was going to wear makeup. She told me I was saying it to her as a joke. Tbh, idrk. I don’t remember saying that, but if it’s true that I did, what merit does that hold?

Another time, when I was a teen (early teen years), I was at my cousins house. We were hanging out and I remember saying out loud, though idr why, but I think it had to have been in context of something we were talking about, “I wonder what it would be like to be a girl.” My mom was in the living room with us when I said that and she gave me a weird look and said “that’s weird.” At the time it was just a passing thought, I never read into it. I didn’t even know at that age being trans was even a thing. Maybe that had something to do with it?

One small part of my earlier years I also have a distinct memory of for some reason may too lay some claim. I had said to myself, “if I were a girl, I’d definitely be either bi or a lesbian.” Once again, I never read into that at all. Another passing thought at the time which I now look back to as evidence.

I’ve never felt much dysphoria. At least I don’t think I have. I’ve never been particularly fond of my body. Perhaps contempt. I knew I wanted it to be different, to be better, more muscular at the very least. But that’s just because I knew guys are perceived as more attractive when they’re muscular and I never was very good at talking to girls, much less having any prospects in the dating scene in general. So I thought being more fit would up my chances. But I digress.

I’ve thought about it since being more accustomed to thinking I’m NB. The idea of having a feminine/female body is somewhat enticing. I’ve also liked the idea of having a vagina, but I very much enjoy my dick and wouldn’t want to get rid of it. The thought of having both sounds like a cool middle ground id be down for. Ive also really liked he thought of having boobs, and getting rid of my body hair. Even before I thought I might be NB, I thought about being the girl I was having sex with while masturbating.

I can look at a female video game character and be a bit envious that I can’t have their body and some of their clothes. But then I’ll see some guys clothes and think those are pretty dope as well. Lately I’ve noticed that I’m having a pull to play girl characters in video games, and I don’t know why. I can play guy characters without a problem, but I am for some reason feeling more interested in playing as a girl.

I’ve tried wearing female clothes (my gfs). Since she’s smaller than me they don’t fit well, but it felt good to wear them. Almost euphoric perhaps, but not quite. I’m not crazy about wearing makeup. I did it before when I was in drama club in high school for a play I did. It was alright for the most part, except for the mascara. I don’t like anything going near my eyes. It was a bitch to take it all off though, so not very fond of it. Again, not sure what merit this holds. Maybe I’m just grasping at straws.

The past few days I’ve looked at myself in the mirror and felt contempt. The yearn for a more womanly body isn’t pervasive in my mind. Will it stay that way or not? I do not know. If you have any questions about anything specific u might want to know to help you with thinking about this, feel free to do so. I’ll do my best to answer. Again, I appreciate your responses.

The issues i am having are. 
A. They never had any kind of gender issues or concerns until the last year or so and even then it went from 0 to 100. So I concerned this may not be a permanent thing. I personally knew people who felt this way and as they got older grew out of it.

B. They already see a therapist due to issues with my exhusband. Is there really a difference between this person and one that ""specializes"" in trans issues? Most that I have found in my area don't strickly work with people who deal with this so I dont know if I should try to find them someone else when they are so comfortable with this person already.  
C. I dont know how to start the conversation with them on if they want to change their name or anything. The only thing that really came out of that convo was they are worried about their sports and friends and I told them to wait till we get things figured out before they worry about that. That may have been the wrong advice but they have serious anxiety issues so I needed to give them something to put that concern on hold for a minute.

2018-09-22 15:18:46,9i0fqk,4,5,"Hi,
I'm totally new to this sub, and so I'm really sorry if this is inappropriate.

I'm a 28 y.o. gay cis-male, out and pretty happy.
I have a friend, also gay, who is mid thirties and pretty miserable. He's never had a relationship and is extremely pessimistic about himself and any chance he has of one, or even hooking up.
In the past I've tried numerous interventions and pep talks, but have by now decided best I can do is be there for him. I suggested he should seek professional help a few times, but he's *very* reluctant.

Over the years he's occasionally brought up wearing make up, or putting on women's clothes, for me or for him. He's also suggested we use female pronouns. I never connected these ""dots"". Finally, he's made comments in the past that I thought were borderline trans-phobic, which would result in a big fight.

We had such a fight two weeks ago. We made up the next day, and he apologized for being insensitive. But something changed. Since then, he brought up me referring to him using female pronouns a few times. Each time I said I had no problem with it, if he wanted to. Finally, he decided we'll have a ""weekend"" in which I will refer to him as female (our language is gender heavy, unfortunately).
His reaction was incredible. He was over-joyous, he sent dozens of happy and excited emojis, he kept correcting me every time I forgot, or pointing out that I had not corrected him when he ""slipped"". He wondered aloud (via text, this is all via texting) how it would be if I referred to him using a female pronoun in a voice message. I immediately did that, and he replied with more smileys and wrote ""king"" (which is slang for me doing a great thing).

This happened last week. Since then he's backed off slightly. When I occasionally resumed referring to him as female he picked it up. But each time he ""noted"" that I did this, like he was surprised. Each time I repeated my encouragement that it was ""absolutely fine"" for me. He insists that he's a man and happily so, continuing to use the female pronoun and noting his ""pleasant surprise"" or his ""blushing"" at it... When we met face to face I dropped it in once or twice, but he didn't pick it up.

He's now calling it his ""vacation hobby"" (he's on vacation). I feel like he got scared of it all.
He's the kind of person that would be very intimidated by sudden change, and very averse to talking to anyone else about this (I'm his only gay friend). I know our other friends would be very accepting, but he won't say anything to them.

So it's just me, and I don't really know what to do. I'm pretty convinced I've now ""connected the dots"" and that this is more than a ""temporary hobby"", though I would not dare guess what exactly it is... I also feel like this connects to his (self imposed) romantic and sexual isolation...
Could I be wrong? do people have temporary feelings like this?
If not, any thoughts on how to approach this? should I encourage it? how?

2018-09-24 01:05:30,9idp2h,2,12,"Before 3 years ago I had no idea that I was transgender. For almost 50 years I just thought I was weird and permanently unhappy and tried to suppress those thoughts. Then I found the wiki definition of the term “gender dysphoria”, and all the lights came on. 

For several months I processed the concept, not sure if or how to proceed. As time went by, I became more and more certain that this was what I’d been experiencing since childhood, based on googling and forums in spare moments of the day. But I come from a conservative family in a conservative state, where even being gay when I grew up would make you a target of derision. So I was afraid, and for several months couldn’t summon the courage to take action. 

As my awareness of the dysphoria and depression increased, I did thought experiments, “what if...”. My resolve gradually increased, and I finally decided to go to counseling to further explore the possibility.  

I went to 6 one-hour counseling sessions with a “gender therapist”.  This was the sort of counselor who used the ridiculous technique of staring at you until you started talking, about something, anything. 

During this time, on my own, I began exploring wearing small bits of female clothing in public. Little things like a bit of jewelry, or extra long women’s jeans. I was so happy when I got my first women’s boots. (Somewhat gender-neutral in retrospect.) So I kind of did a little of my own RLE, just because it felt good. No, it felt awesome. But never super femme, I just started moving towards a more gender-neutral style.

Finally after 6 sessions, the “counselor” made an offhand comment at the end of the session that she didn’t think I was a “good candidate” for HRT. 

That was extremely disconcerting to me. I’d already felt uncomfortable talking to her, and now she made me feel like I was on trial, trying to prove I was trans. I’m not the sort of person who likes for other people to tell me how to live, so I started googling. Eventually I came across the term “Informed Consent”. More light bulbs came on. 

By this time I’d sort of become invested in the knowledge that I was trans. I couldn’t let it go. I was too unhappy with how my appearance was even further masculinizing as I grew older, and saw no other path forward to a happy life. But I still wasn’t certain that I should start taking hormones - what would my parents think? My friends, my workplace, my spouse? Eventually I settled on the idea that I could hide the breast growth for a few weeks (ironic in hindsight), to give me a chance to figure out those pieces of the puzzle. I was still not certain that I should start HRT.

So I started calling around to IC clinics, and eventually made an appointment. On the evening before the appointment, I asked my spouse to confirm that she really for certain did not ever want to have kids with me.

At the clinic I go to, you must first speak with a free counselor for about an hour to make sure you fully understand the consequences and are mentally capable of consenting. Then a physician comes in and you talk for another hour or so, and at the end you walk away with a prescription. 

As I drove back to my home town, prescription in hand, my level of excitement grew, and so did my resolve. I went into the pharmacy, and got a couple of puzzled glances when they read the prescription. But they gave me the pills and I walked back to my car in a slight rain, and simultaneous sunshine, oddly enough. I felt like I was floating. Then I just sat in the car, clenching the bottle in my hand, crying and thanking God for letting me reach that day. (If that sounds sappy - too bad, your problem.) I took a double dose sitting right there in the car, shame on me :)

From that point on, I never had any thought of stopping HRT. I had a very mannish appearance, but the way I approached it was to very gradually change the way I dressed, keeping in pace with the changes the hormones precipitated in my appearance. 

I was never bold. At no point did I ever dress in a way to make me feel the slightest discomfort. The only bold leap I made was the first day I carried a purse lol. This is something that INFURIATES me about the idea of mandatory RLE - who the fuck is the arbiter of how a woman must dress!!? Utter drivel. A woman can dress any way she wants to!! A mandatory RLE requirement is ridiculous and draconian. 

As I added little bits here and there, one of my friends teased me that in day I would come to work in a skirt. I said, “no way, I prefer sort of a butch style”.

Almost one year later to the day, I came to work in a skirt as he predicted, completely confident, not the slightest discomfort. I think I made a joking apology. He looked at me in the hall and said, “Kelly you made the right decision”. I’ll never forget that moment.

The reason I take hormones is not because of how it makes me look. It’s because of how it makes me FEEL. As an added benefit, I get to wear the clothing I’m comfortable in every day.

2018-09-25 05:28:23,9ipgqz,10,8,"(Sorry for the essay. I wrote a TLDR at the bottom.)

I'm so doubtful. I can't tell if how I feel is dysphoria or not because when I think of dysphoria, it's hard not to imagine intense hate for one's parts, or the inability to shower in fear of seeing them. I started questioning this a month ago, when, while talking to a trans friend, I admitted to feeling disconnected from my body, particularly in the feminine parts.

 Saying this made me remember that I used to wish I had a penis growing up (standing to pee, feeling phantom limb, etc) and that I felt... inadequate as a girl. My best friend was the paragon of femininity, (She's goth, hourglass figure, ddd or f breasts, flat stomach, long black hair, beautiful cheekbones. She behaves like a lady in serious company, and like a 13 year old boy with the crudest sense of humor imaginable when with friends.) and I was so focused on being just like her. But I wasn't just like her.

 After a while I started hating pink, dolls, girliness, anything stereotypically girl made me very upset. I would try to avoid wearing a training bra (that is until PE forced me to undress around others. I hated it, obviously. I couldn't bear for anyone to see me) until it was drilled in my head that not wearing one is inappropriate.

 I remember half-hearted attempts at things like makeup and hair care, etc. I was more interested in art and video games. 

I was obviously forced to wear dresses a lot, and I was told I looked beautiful in them, but when I'd look in the mirror I didn't see what they meant. I saw a stranger, and it scared me. As soon as puberty hit, mirrors became this new fascination for me. I'd look in them and wonder why I didn't see myself. Sometimes it would depress me, or scare me, other times I felt empty, but it was pretty hard either way.

The mirror thing changed a lot once I was allowed to cut my hair. I was happier, I thought I finally saw myself. It was a lot more feminine than I wanted, but I was over the moon. After the initial excitement wore off, I started to slip back into self-esteem issues (I was diagnosed my a child therapist as very low self-esteem and depressed) and I began a habit of flattening my breasts in the mirror.

I would have dreams of waking up with a penis, or a male body. I remember the first thing I'd do in those dreams is go and tell my best friend what happened and how happy I was about it. In hindsight, I think this is a really unusual thing for a cis ""girl"" (I really don't like calling myself that. Feels wrong now) to do.

Then, most recently, I had gotten new clothes. I was only able to get one masculine button-up, but it's quickly become my favorite shirt. Most of the others, I'm beginning to realize, show off curves, and that makes me uncomfortable. Not even 3 months ago I loved shorts and long socks, now I can't bear to imagine something so feminine. Problem is, that's most of my wardrobe, so I feel like I wish I had this intense fashion shift from feminine to masculine before I bought the clothes. I can't bear to wear half of them, because I can see my chest in them.



TLDR: Had depression and low self-esteem most my life. Grew up with neutral feelings on girliness, puberty made me hate it. I try to flatten my chest, have panic attacks when looking in the mirror naked, and wish I had a penis. I didn't start realizing this till last month, and now it's most of what I think about. I know I would be happier physically male, but don't want to look manly, though. I want to be physically androgynous (with facial hair though), but more masculine in style. Am I nonbinary or FTM? How can I tell?

2018-09-28 14:32:57,9jngor,7,9,"I'm a (nearly) 31-year-old man.  I'm unhappy with my body.  Not just your usual run of the mill self criticisms.  It's like... every freaking day I know more and more that this... this thing I'm in... isn't right.

I realized recently that a lot of women that I am ""attracted"" to... it isn't because of some sexual desire (admittedly, there's SOME sexual desire or other relationship-based aspect), but more than anything it's jealousy, envy.  I don't necessarily WANT them... I want to BE them.  

I've been dealing with this for awhile now.  It took some time for me to realize it myself.  Then to get the courage to talk to my therapist about it.  Then to get the courage to talk to my wife about it.  Then to get the courage to talk to a very few, select, trustworthy friends about it (unsurprisingly, all women).  Finally, the courage to come on here and talk to some strangers about it.

During this time every single person I've talked to has been so so so supportive and positive and helpful and wonderful.  But none of them have ever... experienced it.  You know?  None of them have ever gone through it.

What I honestly feel like I need more than anything is a sort of... trans-mentor.  Someone I can talk to about... everything: emotions, relationships, clothes, makeup, procedures, family, voice... all of it.  

My therapist recommended a sort of support group that's actually part of a major university's health department who are apparently like top notch folks, super progressive and helpful.  She says that once the time comes, I can use the network there to get connected with doctors or whoever to start the chemical/physical transition steps.

I'm hoping to also find a mentor-type person there that I can utilize.  But it's so scary.  It's really really really scary just taking that step.  Going and being in a room with strangers and talking about such a sensitive subject.  That terrible part of my brain keeps nagging at me ""what if they don't think you should be there?  what if they think you should just stay an ugly lump of a man forever?  what if they laugh at you?""  And I know that's crazy... but knowing that doesn't make it go away.

Another suggestion from my therapist (god I love her to death) was to have a theme party for my upcoming 31st birthday.  Have a Drag party.  So I am.  I've been preparing for awhile and just last night I tried to do my makeup by myself.  This sunday I'm going to try EVERYTHING on.  Makeup, dress, jewelry, wig, gaff, pocket bra with breast forms... everything.

So.  I don't really know why I'm making this post.  I just felt like it was an important step.  I posted a side-by-side picture last night on /r/drag... it seemed safer than coming here.  But here I am anyway.  Check out the picture [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drag/comments/9ji286/long_story_short_ive_decided_i_want_to_look/) if you want.

2018-09-29 08:25:58,9juynv,4,4,"Hello. Sorry to bring up the potentially sensitive topic of porn but I've been reflecting lately on how I watch exclusively gay porn, specifically twink type porn and if that relates to my gender identity and sexual identity as I identify as a(n effeminate) gay transman. I sometimes, rarely, am sexually attracted to women and occasionally look at such high quality images as the suicide girls series.   


I've been thinking about how in gay porn the guys often look better, there's a whole genre of the slender more effeminate types of guys that I like (who from my limited understanding seem to be not as sought after in the gay community?) there's always at least two guys as a given, and generally there's more of an element of equality and intimacy that is often lacking it seems in hetero porn. But being trans there is the issue as well of gender envy and not quite feeling like I fit into the gay world or community because of my plumbing. I love watching it, but I also feel a little sadly disconnected and envious when watching it. I've seen various gay men reject trans men as potential partners for this reason as well which is discouraging. Of course every person is an individual and I'm sure there are accepting individuals out there, and I can't speak for the gay community as I have no idea what it's actually like (though I'd be interested to learn more about it.)   


Anyway this post is all over the place and I apologize for that but are there other trans guys like me? Do you enjoy gay porn? If there happen to be any hetero cis individuals reading this, do you watch gay porn? Do you enjoy it? Why do you think you do if you do? (Trans)ladies this applies to you too of course.

So, I've been feeling really down lately. I'm 27, not on HRT, and struggling emotionally. The root cause won't come as any surprise; I feel unattractive and I'm afraid I never will be.

Like many I wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and see a stranger looking back. The person I see feels like a completely different person. So most of the time I just avoid mirrors.

What I can't avoid is how I feel. It has gotten pretty bad. Shaving is difficult for me, I try to take every last hair off, but if I shave two days in a row everything except my face bleeds and gets really painful ingrown hairs. 

So instead sometimes I just feel really ugly, because I can't keep myself constantly smooth shaven.

Then even when I do shave completely, dress up nicely and do my makeup as best I can, I still don't feel like it's enough. I still feel unattractive. Lately I've been trying to branch out, look for some form of validation to tell me I'm wrong, but all I've found is that people into women don't like me because I was born biologically male, and people into men don't like me because I don't identify as male.

Then there's the problem that, if I do find someone who likes me when wearing makeup, I'll never be able to see them without first spending an hour or more just getting dolled up.

I don't know what to do. I'd like your honest opinion. Am I attractive at all and should I go through HRT? I feel like I'll never be happy if I don't, but at the same time I'm afraid of therapy.

I wasn't surprised they took them but also it feels like shit. I can no longer take anything they say as the truth, to be fair I'm not sure I did before. Obviously I got angry and have texted them about it. One continues to say they had no part in while the other has not responded. Any advice?
