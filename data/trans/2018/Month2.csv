Since then, he goes by his new name and all of his friends are really supportive, which is great. Problem is, his parents are in full denial. They only call him by his birth name, won't look into the topic at all and avoid talking about it. We all try our best to support him as effectively as possible, but of course the situation with his parents weights him down a lot and lately his depression, anxiety and dismorphia have been getting worse and worse and it breaks my heart.

We've talked about how badly he wants to start HRT once but then never again because he hates that topic - he describes it as a dream that'll never come true anyway and is just too depressing to even think about. Like seeing that one bright thing that you want more than anything else in life but it's completely out of reach. 

And that's the thing, because I don't really see why it'd be impossible. He's of age and I've looked into it and here in Germany, health insurance would absorb the costs, the only thing he needs is an affirmation from his psychiatrist and a few general health checks and stuff. He wouldn't even have to discuss it with his parents and wouldn't need their approval either.

I think the point that keeps him from going through with HRT is that he doesn't want to ""disappoint"" his parents and family and he's scared of how a transition would affect their relationship. I completely understand that because their relationship has been really good up until his outing and he still loves them - while they love their ""daughter"" and he's scared of rejection. 

But it's become more and more obvious that he can't keep going like this either and I'm really worried about him.

A short while ago I was ready to be patient. I was willing to hold off on any surgeries while I let hormones do their work. I was going to wait until I was as close to fully passing as I felt I was going to get before going under the knife.


But now, I just want to move forward with things. I will soon begin the hunt for someone to do a tracheal shave and I am beginning electrolysis in mid-march.

So this is my first real time talking to anyone about or even just voicing my thoughts about being trans. I think I've known for a long time but either haven't been able to piece things together or have just been lying to myself. I guess just the usual signs of gravitating towards feminine rolls in games as a child (and video games now), wanting to do girly stuff like makeup/nails, and some crossdressing.

So at the very least I'm not in denial anymore even though I still have a slew of doubts. However I'm slightly freaking out about what to do next.

2018-02-09 07:46:38,7wby64,16,13,"hello all, i found out one of my best friends is trans (mtf) about 6 months ago. it was a huge shock, he was never feminine in the slightest. i will keep referring to him as he because he has not switched pronouns yet. anyway, he's super depressed. he's on hormones and has experimented with wigs and makeup with my help but doesn't have the confidence to go out in public that way. he's constantly caught between wanting to express himself and wanting to fit in, and at this early stage in his transition having both is pretty impossible.

at first he was so happy that people were accepting him (no family support, he hates his mother and doesn't want to tell her) but often he will message me late at night having an emotional breakdown about how none of this is fair and he just wants to be normal. how his life is meaningless. how no one cares even though i obviously do. although we live in a liberal college town, this is still the south. he is afraid for his safety.

She asked my mother for swim shorts and a surf top to go swimming in. My family is very open and accepting and we've never questioned or cared and we happily let her wear whatever she wants (as long as it's appropriate for her age, of course).

She has said a few times in the past that she wishes she were a boy and she *only* shops in the boy section for clothes. 

She wouldn't sleep in her room, that was painted purple, for years and slept on the couch in the living room. She claimed she was afraid of the dark. Her room was recently painted blue, and she now sleeps in there every night.

2018-02-15 17:36:55,7xs00p,2,26,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Please take 10 min to complete a positive response. You can find a guide and link to the consultation at

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like ‚ÄúI support trans rights‚Äù already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

I‚Äôm about 6 weeks into my trans journey and in some ways I‚Äôve been rocketing down this life-road with the gas pedal glued firmly to the floor, I am not exaggerating to say that reading about trans things has consumed 90% of my free time in the last month and a half. Yet, so much I don‚Äôt know, and in other ways i‚Äôm still recently hatched. But my current conundrum or block to progress is this:

1) I know I want to be a woman.

2) I don‚Äôt think I am a woman.

3) I don‚Äôt know if I can become a woman.

I can still call myself trans because that first one is very strong. I want to be a woman badly. In my life I have very rarely cared deeply about anything or desired/wanted things, physical or otherwise. But even in my more despairing moments if I ask myself if I still want this, the answer is always a strong yes. This answer is also why I think i‚Äôm mtf and not nb

The second point is mostly where I want opinions. As strongly as I want to be a woman, I don‚Äôt feel like I am or have ever been a woman deep inside. To be fair, i don‚Äôt particularly feel like man either and I‚Äôm still kinda resentful of masculinity as a general concept.

So my main question is for those of you who have been on this path longer than I have, how much does #2 change over time? Do you start to feel more and more like you are your gender? It seems like most people started by saying ‚ÄúI am &lt;gender&gt;‚Äù (#2) and then had to struggle to accept ‚ÄúI want to be &lt;gender&gt;‚Äù (#1) for themselves, and i‚Äôm just backwards. But this might just be the standard narrative and it‚Äôs not actually how most people experience their gender transition. I don‚Äôt know.

And #3 is mostly that when I do fem things like lipstick or clothing, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel like more of a lady. It doesn‚Äôt help #2. I do sometimes get strong emotional reactions to a bra or a dress, so something‚Äôs certainly happening deep in the back of my skull, but it's mostly crying and frustration and not affirming feelings.

So, dear internet, on the scale of one cat to all the cats. Please tell me if this is reasonably typical.

2018-02-18 05:47:22,7ycgs2,1,2,"Ever since I came out as gender fluid it has been easier for me to express that side of myself online. People just accept me as female online and I usually don't come out to them as trans because I've always noticed that even when people are cool with me being trans they don't trat me like a woman anymore. It's subtle but they start treating me like a trans male to female in little but noticeable and very frustrating ways. 

I know a lot of you are probably thinking ""Catfish!"" but I don't use this online space to lead people on. I may be flirtatious but I'm actually in a committed monogamous relationship in the real world so if anyone ever starts to take things beyond flirtation I gently remind them I'm taken. 

I've actually made a lot of friends online and we have had some deep conversations where we've helped each other with our real world problems and I do deeply care about a lot of these people. 

Recently, however, one of my closest friends actually has an opportunity, and really wants to meet me in person. And I mean I'd love to meet him too and talk but, I am stuck with this very clearly male body.  He'll be coming through the area by the end of next month and I am terrified.

We've spoken about trans issues before and he seems like a very supportive guy but I thibk that he'll react with anger when he discovers I am geneticly male . . . He'll feel betrayed and I can't blame him, I've been lying to him after all. . .

2018-02-20 17:22:05,7yxmkb,5,1,"Hello,

Very soon I will finally be able to start my transition (MTF) but there is still a problem I still don't know how I will solve: hair.

Everyone talks about lazer hair removal and electrolysis but I absolutly can't afford this, not now and not anytime soon either.

So I was wondering how I could get rid of my hair with little money.

Everything I tried yet wasn't effective:

- Trimmer: Didn't cut much
- Depilatory cream: Caused hurtfull bloody red dots on my thighs (the friction of my pants against my thighs still hurt even several days later) and left some remaining hair
- Shaving (disposable razor): Chicken skin effect and bloody red dots on my thighs
- Hot wax hair removal at the esthetician: Many more bloody red dots on my thighs. The esthetician said it would go away in 2 days, it took 2 weeks. My hair grew back by the time my legs recovered. Moreover, I can't afford to pay the esthetician every 2 weeks.

These hair remains to me the most important obstacle between me and my feminity. If some of you had the same problems, I hope you can give me precise advice.

(Pleeeeease don't tell me off for mocking dementia - I live with hers. I know. Call it affection, a coping strategy, reclamation, I don't care which.)

So, firstly, good news is that she doesn't remember me too well from the Joe days, so that when I open the door and I'm presenting female, she doesn't recognise me. My voice is changed enough that when she asks ""which one are you?"" and I reply ""Jenny, Nan! Your granddaughter"", her response is usually something like, ""I didn't realise I had another granddaughter,"" or ""Aren't you tall for a girl?"" Which yes, sisters, I am. 

But secondly, this whole ""becoming a different person to her"", might not've even been necessary. Because in her oldies singing club today, a trans lady came in and sang a song on her guitar, etc. and my mum said that driving nan home in the car, she said ""We had someone in playing the guitar today, but you know, I wasn't sure if it was a man or a woman!"" Mum took a deep breath, and said ""Yes, it was a woman, she's transgender."" ""What's that?"" ""Well, she used to be a boy, but she took hormones, surgery and now she lives as a woman."" (Simplified and possibly inaccurate version I know) ""Gosh, well I've never heard of that before"". No complains, arguments, just peaceful cogitation........ And then a few minutes later......""You know, we had someone playing the guitar today, but I wasn't sure if it was a man or a woman!""

2018-02-26 16:47:10,80eec4,13,19,"When I was growing up, I had a really really deep voice (think somewhere between Garth Brooks and George Ezra). I've spent so much time on vocal training thst my voice is indistinguishable from that of a cis woman's, in fact I'm in the higher ranges. My partner has a naturally higher voice (she is cis), and we've had people tell us thst she and I sound a lot alike, almost indistinguishable. It just takes time and methodology and constant practice.

What you're aiming for is to change where your voice resonates from. Most men, and those of us who were assigned male at birth, have resonance points in our chest. Women, and those assigned female at birth, typically have higher resonance points, somewhere between the clavicle and nose. I currently sit somewhere around my lower jaw/upper neck. You can feel this if you put your hands on your chest and neck (2 fingers works just fine, you don't need to use your whole hand. No need to choke yourself here (leave that for the bedroom if that's what you're into üòâ)

What I recommend is thst you sing along to higher pitched artists (I admit, I started off with Cher, who is very low in vocal range, but I moved up to Ruth B., Kate Voegle, Sarah Berelias, and even Jasmin Thompson).

I also recommend that you watch the videos on trans voice 101 by Stef Sanjati on youtube. ~~I don't have the links handy right this second~~, but her older one is the one I used to train my voice.

[newer video](https://youtu.be/Ah5DGHXbKmk)

I also practiced every waking moment, and I work as the main cashier in a very busy retail bookstore in the south/eastern part of the US. It took time, and not everyone was so supportive of me doing so, but that just fueled my determination. Within 2-3 months I was within normal female range all the time. After 6 months I discovered it was difficult to drop back down at all and speaking with my feminine voice was incredibly natural to me. And now, at a year and a half of self taught vocal training, it's really really difficult to drop, and I can't even get all the way back down. 

It's also very important to remember to breath properly and not sound nasally, or overly valley-girl. Just talk like the cis women around you. Pay attention to how they speak.

I do think it's worth noting that if you use someone who has a different accent than you do as a model for your voice that you could develop some words that are within that verbal accent. Because of that I say Sorry like a Canadian, Water like I'm from the UK, and a few others. You can train yourself out of it, or just enjoy the little quirks  (like I do).

I will be putting the links up shortly. I've received several messages in the past asking how I got to wear I am, and I am always willing to video chat, or just talk on discord, with any of you.

The changes are slow, and you won't notice the changes immediately, but over time it will change. Record a short video of you speaking, and then every couple of months record another one. You will be surprised the differences when compared month to month rather than day to day. This also helps you identify what aspect of your voice you should work on. Feel free to discontinue whenever you feel comfortable. 

**Now for trans men**. I recommend all the steps above but in reverse. You want a lower resonance point, and I recommend singing a long to some deeper pitched artists (start with Ruth B and Cher, and work your way down to some of the deeper male artists like George Ezra or Garth Brooks.)

I admit, I have little experience with this, but it stands to reason (in my mind) that the same can be achieved by doing the exact opposite. You guys also have the added benifet that hormones WILL help with this. It takes time. The changes are slow, and you won't notice the changes immediately, but over time it will change.

This is sort of ranty, but I don't have anyone to talk to so here I go. I'm a biological male, however, I always knew that I wasn't a cisgender person. I grow my hair out to ridiculous bushiness and puberty was really painful for me. I have always hated that I would grow a beard, and I hate my boy name now. I've had dreams of my penis falling off and dreams of me dressed as a girl. Because I live with alt-right, anti-LGBTQ+ parents, I've always been afraid to express myself. My dad has vocally called people trannies and is vocal about his homophobia (I am pansexual).

When I get haircuts, the barber always gives me a god-awful cisgender haircut. It has always bugged me but I've always been to afraid to speak up. My new recent haircut, has bothered me like never before. I can no longer look at myself in the mirror, and I have been thinking a lot about becoming a woman. I have shaved a lot of my body hair and it has eased my mind. I realize that women are treated awfully in the world (see the #MeToo movement) and that transitioning involves even more discrimination. I've been depressed for years and someday, I plan on leaving my state, never talking to my parents ever again, and starting a new life the way I want to.
