2018-08-01 01:57:02,93kq4t,11,10,"Hey everyone! So I‚Äôm an 18 year old trans guy. 
I‚Äôm pre everything and in a really rough patch of my life right now.

I‚Äôve known for about two years and came out to my parents last year, but it went awfully. They sent me to conversion therapy, and it was really stressful. I hated it, so I began pretending I‚Äôm cis. 

My parents are weird. I love them. I really do, but they‚Äôre really controlling. They tell me what to wear and how to look. I had a fever and was going to go to the day and night clinic (walk in doctors office), but my mom stopped me and told me I looked too masculine to go out. One time she drove me and my friends somewhere, and she saw they were dressed feminine and she drove me and my friends back to my house so I could wear something more feminine. It was really embarrassing. They deadname me all the time, near every sentence. 

They get me everything though. A car? Practically new (even though I didn‚Äôt ask for one). School tuition? Paid for. Laptop for school? 1400 dollar gaming laptop.  I feel awful because they‚Äôre always so great with things like this. I feel like I owe them to be their ‚Äúcis daughter.‚Äù

I attempted suicide a couple times two weeks ago. I frequently self harm because of dysphoria and guilt. How dare I want to be myself when I‚Äôve got a perfectly made life.

I want to go to college, but I can‚Äôt afford it on my own, and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd even begin to pay for any of it. My parents threatened to kick me out for being trans one time and I‚Äôm so scared of how I‚Äôd survive because I have no job experience and no further education. 

I can‚Äôt even begin to think about hrt and top surgery.

November is still a ways off, but there's a very important ballot question coming up: [Question 3](https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_3%2C_Gender_Identity_Anti-Discrimination_Veto_Referendum_%282018%29).

A **YES** vote will uphold Senate Bill 2407, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public spaces; allowing us to use the correct bathroom, etc.

A **NO** vote will repeal SB 2407 and rip away our protections from discrimination.

Right now, polls are currently showing 48-55% support for the question, with 30-35% against and the remainder undecided. **YOU**, whether you can vote or not, need to get out there and spread the word to your *supportive* family and friends, and ensure they understand the importance of voting **YES** on this question. Feel free to leave the bigots and asshats out of it; let them live in a low-information world and perhaps abstain. We need every YES vote we can get!

Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of places SB 2407 protects us:

¬∑ Hotels, inns, and motels;

¬∑ Restaurants, bars, and other establishments serving food or drink;

¬∑ Theaters, concert halls, sports stadiums, and other places of entertainment;

¬∑ Auditoriums, convention centers, lecture halls, and other places of public gathering;

¬∑ Sales and rental establishments, including stores, shopping centers, automobile rental agencies, and other retail establishments;

¬∑ Service establishments, including laundromats, dry-cleaners, banks, barber shops, travel agents, gas stations, funeral parlors, employment agencies, and providers of professional services such as lawyers, doctors, dentists, accountants, and insurance agents;

¬∑ Health care facilities, including dental and medical offices, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes;

¬∑ Transportation services;

¬∑ Museums, libraries, galleries, and other places of public display or collection;

¬∑ Parks, zoos, amusement parks, and other places of recreation;

¬∑ Child care centers, senior citizens centers, homeless shelters, food banks, and other social service establishments;

¬∑ Fitness clubs, health spas, bowling alleys, swimming pools, beaches, golf courses, and other places of exercises or recreation.

So this is a long one. I'll try not to be offensive but this has been on my mind for so long now. I really need to get it out. 

I'm currently 25. AMAB. Always been socially awkward, a ""loser"", loner but not by choice. Autsitc. Trouble making friends, even more trouble keeping them. Basically a failure in every sense of the word. [Pretty close to this.](https://imgur.com/skjcfWN)

One thing I notice is that I rarely ever find AFAB like this at all. I've made similar rants in a few other places. Some people claim they have known AFAB ""basement dweller"" types. Any I've know who came close to that- they had an excuse. Sexual assault/abuse as a child or teen. Early pregnancy and the family helps care for the child. AMAB almost never have reasons except social failure and rejection- I'd even call it social abuse, because that's what it is.

A few trans women have replied to my previous rants and said it has to do with how damaging it is being raised male. Of course, any posts pointing this out are sometimes met by cis women being dismissive and saying *""But being women is tougher!!""*. I just hate how it always has to be a competition. It's not. Can't we just post about how damaged we are from forced maleness onto us, without anyone trying to shoot down our traumatic experiences?

I've had dysphoria since I was a young child, in one way or another, but the thing is- I never had physical dysphoria badly. The thought of things like menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth were just scary to me, especially since I'm very squeamish (and yes I know not all cis women do those things). Occasionally I did have desires for breasts and a vagina, but I don't know if it was just to ""fit"" my social dysphoria. 

My most prominent dysphoria is social. I just feel like my life would be so much better if people saw me as a woman. The few times I lived near any trans groups and was able to present and be referred to as she/her, it just felt way better.

 As a socially awkward male-presenting AMAB, especially one who isn't overly masculine and doesn't feel the need to present as such, I get seen as creepy, awkward, possibly a pedo or sex offender, and I'm none of that. I'm not seen as someone to be social with. 

I understand why. I understand that many people have been hurt by cis men (self included). I understand it's perfectly reasonable to have that fear there. 

But the biggest pain is that other AMAB see me that way too. You'd think there'd be some empathy there? No, of course not. Cis men, especially straight ones, want zero fuck all to do with me. Most of the few ""friends"" I had stopped being such when I came out, or even before then for other really petty reasons.

It really irks me when cis men talk about women ""being catty"" and always fighting with each other... yeah right! Way to show off your own insecurities, *bro*. As if every male friend I had didn't leave me in the dust for the most petty reason imaginable. 

I'm not gonna say that trans/masc AFAB don't have it difficult too. I don't know what it's like. But whenever I meet people like myself (on the internet, usually), they're always AMAB. 

I have to wonder if being AFAB makes things easier to socialize and keep lasting interpersonal relationships. I'll never know. I just know that whatever I am, is not seen as someone worth any of that stuff. 

And I know for a fact that it's the way males treat each other. I'm not saying that women just sit around hugging each other. But everything from a male is always telling me to toughen up, always trying to bully me. If it is nice, it's because he sees me as a sexual object. 

Even the *supposed* advantages of being AMAB... like physical strength? I never had that! I took co-ed gym classes most of my life... I was easily one of the worst performing students, if not the worst. Would being AFAB had made it easier on me? I don't know, because even as AMAB, I could not reach what the fitness test minimum for AFAB were anyway. But, as insulting as this is, the lowered expectations would have benefited me a ton. 

When a cis woman gets applauded for lifting something heavy, meanwhile I'm expected to lift double and if I can't, I get downright humiliated and verbally abused. Any job I get (the minimum wage slave labor willing to hire me), I have all these physical expectations hurled at me. Any complaints I make about this get met with a victim-blaming *""Go to the gym, bro!""*.

Not even just that- men say that I'm supposed to be ""more emotionally stable"" than a woman? Yeah right. I'm bipolar and I'm a mess. They can go on about the supposed advantages of being AMAB- I got absolutely none of em. I feel like a failure.

The AFAB I talk to- cis women, trans men, non-binary, gender queer, all others- seem very well adjusted in life, or at least, way more than me. They have their group of stable friends, and have for a while. Most don't have trouble getting dates if they desire. Most have an actual career, or are working on getting one. They have a light at the end of the tunnel- a life set up to promise things may end up okay.

I could never even dream of that. I'll likely never have any of that. I think I'm just too damaged at this point. ",trans,Just really wish I could've been AFAB- it seems better socially,1533525055.0,"{'created_utc': 1533499855, 'id': '94us5f', 'num_comments': 9, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. The other subs seemed to have stricter rules, and I fear I would\'ve been banned for ""stirring the pot"" or whatever. If you know a better one, I\'d appreciate to be redirected. \n\nSo this is a long one. I\'ll try not to be offensive but this has been on my mind for so long now. I really need to get it out. \n\nI\'m currently 25. AMAB. Always been socially awkward, a ""loser"", loner but not by choice. Autsitc. Trouble making friends, even more trouble keeping them. Basically a failure in every sense of the word. [Pretty close to this.](https://imgur.com/skjcfWN)\n\nOne thing I notice is that I rarely ever find AFAB like this at all. I\'ve made similar rants in a few other places. Some people claim they have known AFAB ""basement dweller"" types. Any I\'ve know who came close to that- they had an excuse. Sexual assault/abuse as a child or teen. Early pregnancy and the family helps care for the child. AMAB almost never have reasons except social failure and rejection- I\'d even call it social abuse, because that\'s what it is.\n\nA few trans women have replied to my previous rants and said it has to do with how damaging it is being raised male. Of course, any posts pointing this out are sometimes met by cis women being dismissive and saying *""But being women is tougher!!""*. I just hate how it always has to be a competition. It\'s not. Can\'t we just post about how damaged we are from forced maleness onto us, without anyone trying to shoot down our traumatic experiences?\n\nI\'ve had dysphoria since I was a young child, in one way or another, but the thing is- I never had physical dysphoria badly. The thought of things like menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth were just scary to me, especially since I\'m very squeamish (and yes I know not all cis women do those things). Occasionally I did have desires for breasts and a vagina, but I don\'t know if it was just to ""fit"" my social dysphoria. \n\nMy most prominent dysphoria is social. I just feel like my life would be so much better if people saw me as a woman. The few times I lived near any trans groups and was able to present and be referred to as she/her, it just felt way better.\n\n As a socially awkward male-presenting AMAB, especially one who isn\'t overly masculine and doesn\'t feel the need to present as such, I get seen as creepy, awkward, possibly a pedo or sex offender, and I\'m none of that. I\'m not seen as someone to be social with. \n\nI understand why. I understand that many people have been hurt by cis men (self included). I understand it\'s perfectly reasonable to have that fear there. \n\nBut the biggest pain is that other AMAB see me that way too. You\'d think there\'d be some empathy there? No, of course not. Cis men, especially straight ones, want zero fuck all to do with me. Most of the few ""friends"" I had stopped being such when I came out, or even before then for other really petty reasons.\n\nIt really irks me when cis men talk about women ""being catty"" and always fighting with each other... yeah right! Way to show off your own insecurities, *bro*. As if every male friend I had didn\'t leave me in the dust for the most petty reason imaginable. \n\nI\'m not gonna say that trans/masc AFAB don\'t have it difficult too. I don\'t know what it\'s like. But whenever I meet people like myself (on the internet, usually), they\'re always AMAB. \n\nI have to wonder if being AFAB makes things easier to socialize and keep lasting interpersonal relationships. I\'ll never know. I just know that whatever I am, is not seen as someone worth any of that stuff. \n\nAnd I know for a fact that it\'s the way males treat each other. I\'m not saying that women just sit around hugging each other. But everything from a male is always telling me to toughen up, always trying to bully me. If it is nice, it\'s because he sees me as a sexual object. \n\nEven the *supposed* advantages of being AMAB... like physical strength? I never had that! I took co-ed gym classes most of my life... I was easily one of the worst performing students, if not the worst. Would being AFAB had made it easier on me? I don\'t know, because even as AMAB, I could not reach what the fitness test minimum for AFAB were anyway.

2018-08-07 20:07:33,95f3so,5,9,"TL;DR: I'm questioning everything right now and am trying to sort through the chaos in my brain.

I (25) have identified as a man for my whole life and gay since I was 19. I've always been more on the stereotypically feminine side. I've always preferred female friends over male ones, and I've always had a deep appreciation for things that, traditionally, are meant for women. I've dressed in women's clothing, and while I wouldn't have admitted it then (it was supposedly a joke), I really enjoyed it. Despite all that, I've always been a man.

That said, I've also hated my body for as long as I remember. I'm naturally pretty hairy, and I was always heavier. I chalked up my dislike to that. However, over the last couple of years, I've lost a lot of weight, and I started removing my body hair, and while that helped, it made me think even more and more about my body. I want to be pretty. I want to wear dresses and have curves. Today, I decided I wanted to look at dresses on Amazon, and I almost cried because I want one so badly, but I'm scared to admit it to anyone. I asked my boyfriend (who is bi) in passing whether he would be ok dating a trans person, and he said he would, but at the same time, he was a bit uncomfortable a while back when we started talking about the idea of crossdressing. Or at least it seemed that way. That scares me. I'm sure if it came down to it, he would accept me , but I'm not sure what it would mean for our relationship.

On top of all that, I do like my penis. It's not something that grosses me out or something that I don't feel is part of me. That makes me question whether it's really that I'm trans or if I'm just genderfluid. To be honest, this isn't the first time I've questioned my gender identity. Less than a year after coming out as gay, I mentioned in passing to a close female friend of mine ‚Äì let's call her Elise ‚Äì that sometimes I feel more comfortable with the idea of femininity. The conversation went something like this:

&gt;Me: You know, sometimes I'm jealous of women. I want to look like that. Is that weird?  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: What? Are you saying you're trans?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ... I don't know...  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: \*panicking slightly\* What?... You're not serious.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: ...  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: I can't deal with this right now.

I can't even begin to tell you how much that hurt. I worry about what others might think if I decided to transition. Where I live, it's bad enough being gay. i mean, it's not terrible here, but the amount of judgement and disapproving stares I get already is more than enough. On top of that, a trans man was beaten to death two years ago in my state's most progressive city.

There are so many things going through my mind right now, and I'm not sure how to process them. thank you, r/trans, for listening to/reading the chaos that's erupting from my brain. I'd greatly appreciate any resources you might be able to share. Let me know your thoughts.

What's the best makeup brand(s) in terms of quality, cost, and treatment of trans customers?

How do I get rid of/effectively conceal my stubble after shaving my face?

I'm very hairy naturally, so how do I shave my legs and not get razor burn?

How do I shave my groin and between my asscheeks? (Marked post as NSFW for this one. Just to be safe.)

What are good places to find cute clothes online if I don't feel confident going to a physical store to buy clothes?

And how do I make my fingers appear longer/thinner?

It was a weird overdose that I don't want to get into, but I felt like it rewired me or something. I haven't felt the same since, not just mentally but overall. Just off. It's also been since then that this feeling of dysphoria is there, and a feeling that I shouldnt be male. Like I know I've always been different, liked and got along better with girls my entire life/hated trying to get along with the majority of guys, but that just seemed like me. But I've never felt right about myself

I've thought about it for a while, sometimes it sounds like the thing I'm missing while other times I just reject it. I'll probably bring it up with a psychologist or something, but even if I did I don't think transitioning would ever be an option. If it were I'd wait for a while, at least till I finish college (got two more semesters!)

Idk if I should even be posting this here or if anyone can relate. I feel bad for having the dysphoria now since I didn't as a child, even if I was always a bit different. But I guess people change and events (or drugs) can change people.

I don't really what to say and I'm sorry if I say things the wrong way or vaguely I just to vent.

I'm very unsure of myself at the moment I'm(or thought anyways) a cis man but as a child I always wished I was a woman and would dress up when I was alone, I always felt so ashamed of myself afterwards and pushed it away for year despite how in the moment i'd be so happy. I stopped when I was 13 telling myself it was wrong and I should be ashamed of it.

I actually said it out loud and my mom looked at me with strange eyes and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs weird‚Äù. At the time, it was just a passing thought and that‚Äôs what I had told her.

I‚Äôve put on nail polish before because I thought it would be fun (early teens). It was clear nail polish and my mom had put it on for me and for my brother. I only did it once because I thought to myself ‚Äúboys shouldn‚Äôt like this I can‚Äôt do that again‚Äù or something to that affect. Sometimes when I‚Äôve jerked off about having sex with girls, I‚Äôd imagine myself in there position.

I don‚Äôt have a problem with my dick, I like it very much. But I have thought about what it would feel like to have a vagina. I‚Äôve thought about how it would be nice if I could have both, though I know that isn‚Äôt realistic (hot-swappable genitals sounds great tbh). I don‚Äôt necessarily have a problem with my body as it is, but I noticed that I don‚Äôt really like body hair all that much. I started shaving/trimming/grooming my chest (late high school) and (once again mentioning her) my mom saw and asked if I was gay (I‚Äôm bi but I didn‚Äôt find that out till later on).

I‚Äôve only recently started questioning my gender (I‚Äôm in my early 20s). Idk how dysphoria should affect me and how it should feel. I‚Äôve thought about it a good bit and think I‚Äôm genderqueer. I‚Äôm not opposed to my assigned gender completely, but I definitely don‚Äôt fit in it 100%. I‚Äôve thought about having a more feminine body. I like the idea of having curves and boobs. I like the idea of wearing feminine clothing. I‚Äôve never really cross dressed, but it‚Äôs something I want to try. I‚Äôve worn female underwear before and it felt good. I‚Äôve tried to wear some of my gfs clothes, but I can‚Äôt fit into them properly without fear of tearing them. I was in a musical once as an extra and had to wear makeup. It wasn‚Äôt that bad, but it did feel weird a little since it was my first time. That being said, I‚Äôd probably prefer more of an androgynous look with a more feminine undertone? Not by much tho.

Starting about 1 year in, I started falling for people way harder and faster if I liked them. It has gotten more and more intense as time has gone by and I don't know where the ceiling is. Now if I begin to like someone, it not too long before I just want to fall over on them and beg them to just hold me, pet me and tell me I'm pretty. Cuddling is like the best. If they aren't feeling it, I litterally have to get away from them because wanting their attention and affection so badly for long periods of time can be sorta painful. This started recently and before I could just talk myself out of it but now I can't. If I start crushing I get all blushy and just want cuddles and kisses so bad that my body starts intensely tingling all over. The only way to stop this is to leave the area completely.

You end up depressed because you can't focus on doing anything you love, you're so wrapped up in who you're trying to be and what you're trying to achieve that you can forget to just be you and do the things you love.

Ya'll need that reset so you can get back to facing life with a fresh, clear mind that's not exhausted. 

A lot of you might be like, **""How do I just stop thinking about it?""** and for you, meditation is gonna be your best friend.

I suggest downloading Headspace and using the 10 day free trial as a starter course on how to meditate. From here you can either continue on doing mindful meditation on your own, pay for the full app, or use Youtube to find other guided meditations.

Meditation will teach you to control your mind, but not just while meditating, but also throughout your day. This is integral in being able to take a mental break, otherwise you can try all the distractions you like, music, TV, video games, your mind will still find a way to get back to what's nagging it if you don't learn to silence it.

If you can already shut down negative thoughts, that's great, you need to exercise that control.

Try giving yourself assigned break days. Like maybe tuesdays and thursdays are days for you to just get away from the worries, and focus on your current day instead of what's ahead. 

- Put on some of your favorite feel-good music and blast it on the way to work. 

- Stay away from trans reddit, blog posts etc. and just focus on you. 

- Avoid mirrors or anything that could trigger dysphoria or thoughts about your image, and ignore thoughts about your appearance, let them pass.

After plenty of reading and soul searching I have come to grips that I have some deal of dysphoria around my gender, this is all well and good cause when I first realized I might not identify entirely as male I was primarily confused and scarred (and being less confused makes me less scarred).  I would see a woman or a dress, realize that what I thought was admiration was really more envy then, hem and haw until I reached a conclusion.   


That conclusion being that I desperately wanted to present as femme. However this conclusion would \*excite\* me and after a victory lap I'd realize most dysphoria and all enthusiasm had vanished. Enter a vicious cycle of excitement, celebration, and come down hang over. I don't want to get into anything gross(er) but for anyone with questions, yes I become so ecstatic at the idea of experiencing intimacy with a woman, while being a woman that I fool around. I guess I'm more pan though, cause I can see myself with guys as long as I imagine myself being desired.   


Now I have ALOT of concerns, Enough to make this long winded mess a novel, but here are my top 3 for brevity.   
1: Is this just a kink? I've read that men are generally more honest after orgasm, so that would explain it (However, does that count if I don't know what's truly true?).  I don't want to offend legitimate trans people but I am unsure of the sincerity of my feelings and desires. I guess to any trans peeps reading this I'd like to apologize.   


2: This dysphoria feels real. Alot of accounts I've read say that dysphoria isn't always feeling like you were born in the wrong body, but sometimes the gentle pull of attraction to being another gender. This scares me because I've been thinking thoughts like this for years. I remember even telling myself I wanted to reincarnate as a woman, and that I might ""be happier like that"".   


3: I thought I had a 3rd one but I guess that's it. I guess if I had to say something it'd be that I know I'll lose a lot of family and sort of friendships. I'm a pastor's child in the bible belt. I'm kind of scarred about the answer, but I want to live honestly.   


TLDR: I can become painfully dysphoric until I've climaxed, If I avoid climaxing the dysphoria doesn't go anywhere.

What's the difference between me and rain storm?? A rain storm will eventually pass.

 So I know this title may suggest I'm here trolling but I want to have a genuine conversation about passing and about the ways trans people can be shitty to each other. I personally pass like maybe 2 days out of the year. (No I don't look like a man, I just look transgender) I don't really mind it either. People are still nice to me. People still find me attractive. I still have some dysphoria about parts of my body, but that's my thing.

 If you are someone who values passing a lot and wants to attain that, that's fine and I'm rooting for you. I used to pass quite frequently. I would spend 2 hours on my hair and makeup everyday. I practiced my voice everyday. It got to the point that I could talk face to face with cis people who I knew in highschool and they'd have no idea I was trans or that they knew me from somewhere. This was before I started hormones. I just got sick of it after a while. I just wanted to relax. I was tired of working so hard just to get people's respect and feel like I was ""doing it the right way"". I kinda threw out the rule book around 8 months on Hormones.

If you too have drug the gutters online and you may have found the term HON. This is a nasty word that trans-feminine people will call each other when they aren't passing. It comes from the saying, "" You look great Hon."" used in a disingenuous way, mocking the ""everyone is beautiful"" ideology. To a degree, yes I would like people to be honest with me about how I look but I also want them to not have a head that's full of garbage.

 According to the formula for what make you a hon, I'm all of that. I have a big forehead, wide shoulders, big feet, I'm 6'1"" and I have a deep voice. Do some of these things give me dysphoria? Yes. Does that mean my transition is hopeless and that I'm wasting my time? Hell No! I'm 2 1/2 years on hormones and this is the happiest my life has been. I get treated well in public even when people clock me. On the rare occasion that someone is shitty toward me, that's not a failure on my part, that's just that person's weird  transphobic bullshit. Most people look at me a little curious but then they give me this big warm smile. Cis het men will still tell me I'm beautiful in public. What I'm saying is that I think passing is cool and all, but it doesn't make you any better or that much better off in life. You can be completely non passing and also very beautiful.

Until tonight.

I've been watching ""Altered Carbon"" on Netflix.  If you have strong/severe dysphoria I'd suggest you don't watch the show.

A major part of the show (explained in the first episode, so I'm not spoiling anything) is that a person's consciousness can be put into another body.  I've been binge watching all day, at work and at home.  And I got to the fifth episode or so and a panic attack-like feeling hit me.  My heart started racing, I couldn't think straight, everything seemed to go in slow motion for a minute, I felt like I had forgotten to breathe, and I got a feeling like a shot to the gut.

I think what set it off was the very very brief moment of obviously unfounded daydream/hope that something like that would be possible - that I could just get a new female body with all the right working parts and just have the outside match the inside instantly.

It was literally less than a second after that thought first formed in my brain that I almost started crying. I can't really explain the feeling properly.  It's like my brain went into overload or meltdown or something, and I just felt really uncomfortable and sad about having male genitalia, and having a masculine body.

2018-08-24 18:51:23,9a03bb,0,1,"While some transitioning individuals have supportive family members others do not. My family is split on the issue. Most of them support me, but unfortunately I have lost the support and love of my mother. 

All trans people face huge obstacles. When I came out at age 14 I moved in with my sibling because the tension and bullying at home with my mom was that severe.

In my life I have been to 9 schools and have dropped out of highschool twice during the time I lived with my sibling. Although it was a long, legal battle with my parents I was finally able to begin hrt at age 15. During a period of two years I had no contact with my mom, only saw my other siblings every few months, and became an alcoholic. I still had to do my best to stick to highschool for better future opportunities, but I was barely squeezing by. I encountered tons of discrimination at work and at school, but had to get my ass out of bed every morning, walk, and take 3 bus transfers to get to school.

In my junior year of highschool when mothers day came around I fell into a debilitating depression because of my non-existant relationship with my mom. I was short fused in my temper that week as everyone was asking what i did for mothers day and social media blew up with mothers day posts. My depression this week was so bad that I hadnt showered in days, i had lost a considerable amount of weight due to lack of appetite, I got about 3 hours of sleep every night, came to school every morning hungover or baked, and during school hours I just couldnt function.

I was always on time to class, always had straight A's, all of my teachers loved me. During this week one day we had a new sub in chemistry. I was so drained and was holding back tears. I didnt have enough energy to work on my assignment. The sub tried to force me to pick up my pencil and do the assigment, demanding many times. I had refused. In front of the entire class he began to scold me saying that he wouldnt be surprised if I dropped out of school soon, and with that attitude I would get nowhere in life. Then he sent me to the principles office.

I am now proud to say that I am 17 years old, I have graduated highschool early, I am now in college and working in the beauty industry. I love what I do, and now I can say that I am happy.

My family is split on the issue. Most of them support me, but unfortunately I have lost the support and love of my mother. \n\nAll trans people face huge obstacles. When I came out at age 14 I moved in with my sibling because the tension and bullying at home with my mom was that severe.\n\nIn my life I have been to 9 schools and have dropped out of highschool twice during the time I lived with my sibling. Although it was a long, legal battle with my parents I was finally able to begin hrt at age 15. During a period of two years I had no contact with my mom, only saw my other siblings every few months, and became an alcoholic. I still had to do my best to stick to highschool for better future opportunities, but I was barely squeezing by. I encountered tons of discrimination at work and at school, but had to get my ass out of bed every morning, walk, and take 3 bus transfers to get to school.\n\nIn my junior year of highschool when mothers day came around I fell into a debilitating depression because of my non-existant relationship with my mom. I was short fused in my temper that week as everyone was asking what i did for mothers day and social media blew up with mothers day posts. My depression this week was so bad that I hadnt showered in days, i had lost a considerable amount of weight due to lack of appetite, I got about 3 hours of sleep every night, came to school every morning hungover or baked, and during school hours I just couldnt function.\n\nI was always on time to class, always had straight A's, all of my teachers loved me. During this week one day we had a new sub in chemistry. I was so drained and was holding back tears. I didnt have enough energy to work on my assignment. The sub tried to force me to pick up my pencil and do the assigment, demanding many times. I had refused. In front of the entire class he began to scold me saying that he wouldnt be surprised if I dropped out of school soon, and with that attitude I would get nowhere in life. Then he sent me to the principles office.\n\nI am now proud to say that I am 17 years old, I have graduated highschool early, I am now in college and working in the beauty industry. I love what I do, and now I can say that I am happy. I look back at that experience now and it gives me a boost of confidence knowing that I proved him wrong.

He had a temper and would often call me names that internalized homophobia in me as I had to conform myself to fit in the box I thought being a son was.

It was an amazing experience. I had wanted to do this for a while now, and have thought out crazy scenarios to do it. It happened kinda by chance. I was making a late dinner to use up the mish mash of leftover ingredients and wound up making way too much. I offered him some and we ate together in the living room.

He let me know that he didn‚Äôt care what I did or how I choose to live my life, he just wanted me to be happy. I am happy. I‚Äôm so grateful to have as wonderful of a father as I do.

We continued talking about a wide variety of topics. The past, the future, aliens, pretty much everything. Most of the conversation was him rambling, as he is oft to do, but I enjoy listen to how his mind works.

The night ended with a hug and he told me that was one of the best nights he ever had. It was for me too. For most of my life it has felt like we could have been in the same room but still be miles apart. I feel like that gap has been bridged in just a few hours. I love him. I love myself.

Hi folks -

‚Äã

I am an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southern Mississippi whose research focuses on suicide prevention. Some colleagues and I are looking to collect some preliminary data to help us understand in what ways risk is similar (and different) across a range of diverse populations with elevated suicide rates. Some of these groups overlap with one another quite a bit (e.g. gun owners, law enforcement, active duty military) and some are quite different (e.g. veterinarians, first time new mothers). Our goal is to recruit enough folks to consider groups in isolation or in comparison to one another so that we can understand better how risk shifts in nature from one group to another (and within broader groups that have substantial diversity within them).

‚Äã

One group that has been getting very little attention and whose perspective has been underrepresented in suicide research is the transgender community and I am hoping that individuals who identify as transgender may be willing to take part in this anonymous survey. If you do, some of the items you answer will be ones asked of everyone and some will be unique to the group you indicate that you most identify with. Some of the items are repetitive (sorry...that's an unfortunate reality of scientific research), but we did out best to make the survey both comprehensive and short.

‚Äã

Keep in mind that, although this post is specifically seeking individuals who identify as transgender, we would be thrilled to have anyone take part. Eligibility simply depends upon whether you currently identify with one of the specific groups we are considering in this particular study.

‚Äã

I myself am not an expert on the perspective of the transgender community, but my colleague at Louisiana State University is and he developed this section of the survey. That being said, I would be more than happy to receive and pass along feedback ([michael.anestis@usm.edu](mailto:michael.anestis@usm.edu)) and hope that we are able to contribute something of value through our efforts.

‚Äã

The survey has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of USM. If you are interested in taking part, here is the link.

So I took my 15 yo transgender step brother to the barbers down the road where I always get my hair cut which I was surprised at because like him I had/have anxiety when I was that age and refused to even get my hair cut, so it was quite a big deal regardless of gender identity. 
So anyway the ride over there he got cold feet and didn‚Äôt want to go in but I somehow convinced him having not even considered unlikely scenario that was about to happen.
 
The female barber of course addresses him as a her which isn‚Äôt a big deal as he‚Äôs used to it. (Or we expected it to happed) and said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt cut girls hair.‚Äù
I replied with ‚Äúshe just wants a boys cut‚Äù
She followed by the same ‚Äúbut we don‚Äôt do girls hair‚Äù

Me being me I cut to the chase and took the barber aside and said she‚Äôs  transgender, just treat her like a boy and give her a boy haircut...okay?

She then had to fetch the other barber/owner to see if he would cut his hair. 
You can see where this is going.
He refused.
I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs discrimination‚Äù
The female barber said ‚Äúyeh sorry‚Äù
And with that we left. I was angry and embarrassed and caught so off guard by it. I really didn‚Äôt understand why it was such a big deal to some people and was amazed that something like this would happen just down the road. 
I felt like absolute shit after that emotions were fucking me up let alone how my brother felt.

I feel like a twat for taking him there.
