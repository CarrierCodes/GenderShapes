2018-10-01 00:46:37,9kbono,2,1,"So, for the past year or so I thought that I was a trans guy, but now I don’t know. Usually I’m just okay, my chest gives me a weird feeling, and so does my voice and height but that’s mostly it. But, there’s one or two guys, and when I’m around them everything feels amplified. Suddenly my voice seems 9 octaves too high and my chest seems huge and alien and I feel so incredibly girly and I just can’t function properly. I can’t talk or move right without feeling like it’s too girly, and that that’s how everyone’ll see me. The thing is though, it’s only really bad with certain people, not all dudes. And sometimes I want to rip my skin off and start over as a guy, as an older brother instead of an older sister. But sometimes I’m okay. And those are the times where I just don’t know. I’ll see a girl and I can’t tell if I want to be her or date her. Especially now, I’m going to stop growing soon and I’m short (5’8) and I feel this desperate pressure to hurry up and start T so I’m like all the other guys. But I don’t know if T is right for me.

And I have ***never*** had a problem with my penis. Not ever.

My partner is a cis-gender woman and we often have PIV sex. We've always had great sex, before and after I realised I was trans. But then, just yesterday, I just wanted to take my genitals off and put them away somewhere. I was lying almost naked on bed and the room was a bit warm. All I could think of was to take this extra source of heat from between my legs and put it as far away from my body as possible.

I chalked it off to the heat and tried not to think of it... Until today, when I sat down to work in my underwear and... these *things* were just... down *there*, you know. In the way. 

I know that—at least right now—I'd feel more comfortable if they weren't there. I don't want to get rid of them, I know that. But I'd feel better if I didn't have them attached to my body right now. 

I mean, I've heard many a cis girl say *""gosh, boobs can be really uncomfortable! I wish I could just take them off for a while.""*  This might be just like that, right?

If it helps, when I was just a girl, I'd hide my thing between my legs and pretend I had a pussy, but it was like a fun game. I liked looking at my ""pussy"". Then I'd untuck and kept being a child. I wouldn't give it a second thought.

One day, when I was like 6 or 7, I took my round paper scissors and put them round the base of my thing. I squeezed a little, but stopped almost immediately. I knew I'd cut myself and bleed if I pressed hard. I really didn't want to have a painful cut there nor to get in trouble with my mother. I never said anything to anybody until today. 

I do remember that I didn't do it over any sadness or discomfort with my penis. I don't remember thinking that part of my body had anything to do with it either. I swear I still have no idea why I did it.

I totally know that dysphoria doesn't need to be experienced from an early age to be authentic. By extension, I know this also applies to genital dysphoria. I just don't know if that's what's going on here.

I mean, I used to be so sure I didn't want SRS and now this happened and I don't know anymore and I hate not knowing things and I want to cry a little because I'm scared.

I'm sorry for the long post in advance.

So...Ever since maybe high school? Maybe before that? I began to question my gender. I kind of knew that that was normal and thought nothing of it...until it continued all the way 2 years after high school. In high school, I questioned it OFTEN. Often times to the point where'd I'd accidentally get myself into a panic attack. Constantly questioning to where my head hurts and I just feel numb all over.

I would then get my hair short and loved it. Dresses? Felt uncomfortable. Makeup? Eh. Just girly stuff in general? Always felt wrong to me. But, I thought, Hey I'm just a tomboy maybe I can get used to the girly stuff.

News flash: I still have not. I feel like it isn't even me when I look in the mirror with girly stuff. I feel super happy with the short hair and having guy moments. Dressed as a guy for my cousin's graduation and man did I feel good. Button up with slacks and shoes? Oh yes. 

Now I'm not terribly uncomfortable with a vagina. I'm just...neutral, I guess? Same for breasts but then I get days where I'm law, is this even supposed to be here? It feels alienated. My name even sounds weird. 

I've gone back and forth. I also have BPD which is the main reason why I question, due to fearing that it could be the BPD acting up or imposter disorder (I think that's the thing?)

I'm tired of always thinking about my gender and sex. I look like a man but often I just the get this urge to be something else. Maybe not a woman (I don't want any surgeries), but something else than being a man.

2018-10-03 12:12:11,9l0kr0,13,1,"Hello there, I am sure you are tired of people questioning things about your gender and having the need to explain themselves. That would tire anyone. However I am very uneducated in this area and would like to know trans people perspectives in order to better understand and coexist.

Some background: I am cis male from a small country that is quite intolerant sadly. I don't personally know any trans people, its never talked about in the media and for like 15 years of my life I didnt even fully understand its a thing (similar experience with LGBT people but I got to know some of them personally). I have never had any thoughts of changing my gender, and the only times I've crossdressed was in theater sketches, mostly for comedic effect. The only reason I am so interested in this topic is because I recently came across a youtube channel ContraPoints, which has interesting topics in general, but also touches upon transgender issues.

My questions:
1. Do you think there are two genders, and you transition from a to b or vice versa, or there is this spectrum with you falling somewhere in the middle? 
2. Are there more men who transition into women, or more women who transition into men?
3. How did being trans affect your sexual orientation? If you were a straight men and become a woman, are you still into women or does that change? Or are all trans people initially gay  but become straight afterwards?
4. Are you always thinking about gender identity, sex, etc. I noticed that LGBT people I know all seem to be very tied to their orientation as part of their core identity?
5. Is it important to you that others perceive you as your new gender in terms of appearance? If you transition into a women, do you try to be very feminine? Doesnt that just enforce gender stereotypes? I know there are trans people who take pride in having female body with facial hair, what is the term and reasoning for that?
6. Are there any trans people who arent so focused on gender at all. For example, some cis people really take pride in the fact they are male or female. Others, like me, don't really consider their gender to be very important to their sense of self. Is it possible to live as a human that is comfortable in their own skin, WITHOUT bringing up identity politics?
7. How do you feel about legislating gender pronouns. I understand that if someone used the wrong pronoun on you, you might feel like your choice of gender expression isnt valid, but should misgendering be considered a crime? Personally I use the pronoun I think when I see the person, so if you look like a female to me, I will say she/her. But if you said to me calmly that youd rather be called he/him, I will do so going forward.
8. Obviously this is one of those topics where being objective is very hard because it affects you personally. One thing of criticisim I hear is that people who believe there are two genders and no switching should be allowed are using scientific facts while transfolk use feelings and 'inner truth' as their defense. Is this assumption true? Are there any famous trans people who debate without bringing up their own feelings? 

Thank you for reading and hopefully this leads to a more coexisting society

Join the fun and let's get it trending at Number 1!!!  


The aim of the campaign is to celebrate what makes us trans, to make people feel better about themselves and their bodies, as trans people. Trans people are often made to feel such shame about their bodies and are held up to impossible standards based on normative ideas about bodies and expression — It is time that we acknowledge how far many of us have come, and that we celebrate all the things that makes our bodies trans.

2018-10-04 05:49:25,9l97jb,11,1,"I noticed my feminine traits at a young age. I remember lounging on the couch and thinking I should change my position because only girls sit like that (I don't remember any specifics beyond that). I was around 8 years old. By 10, I was overwhelmed by and ashamed of my interest in feminine things. In my mind, indulging in those interests would make me a fag which was something I was taught to fear even though my mother was ok with lesbians. One specific comment she made around then stands out in my recollection, ""See those two right there? Stay away from them, they'll turn you into a faggot."" A guy and his crossdressing partner (probably trans, but it was the 90's in rural Iowa).

I was 11-12 the first time I wished I could be a girl, ""Starlight, Star bright..."" Yeah. It was within a year after that that I started sneaking my sister's clothes to wear when I was home alone so I could see what it felt like to be a girl. At 15, I started using sexuality to feel feminine (thanks to all the pedos of Yahoo! Chat! Lol). That continued for the next 11 years. 

During that time, my sexual behavior could be called self-harm. When I finally started being with girls irl, I couldn't orgasm. So naturally, I thought I was gay and started trying guys. I didn't enjoy the sex as much as with women except for 1 thing: men loved feminizing me and it was better than in the chatrooms. I was a huge slut, and I'm damn lucky I never caught anything worse than a yeast infection.

After I finally learned to have my own orgasm at 26 (no joke) but actually found my interest in sex decreasing, I despaired for a little bit. What was wrong with me that I didn't enjoy the best feeling I'd ever had? I couldn't help but wonder. I began having sex less and less because it started making me miserable. FINALLY, I came to a realization after a somewhat dark sexual encounter: I hate penetrating. More than that, I hate my penis and the urge to penetrate with it. I hate my testicles and their need to ejaculate. I cried and wished I could be free of all that. 

So came an increase in how often I wished to be a woman, and I was even crazy enough to work out how exactly to word a wish to a genie to make it happen how I want it to happen if I ever met one. Then, I started looking at sissy porn. A sort of revisit to my feminization via sexuality. I found myself wishing I could even be one of the sissies in the porn, they might not have a woman's body but they at least had a hope of passing unlike me. If they wanted to transition, they could at least look like a woman. That's when it hit me: I want to transition, but I'm afraid to look like a she-he freak (no offense intended, just explaining the process). Who would ever possibly want to date a woman who was obviously trans? But wait... I've been single for 10 years. Who am I holding out for? Why not just do something to reduce my misery in being alive even a little? So what if I won't ever be a supermodel, it's not like I'm magazine worthy now. And so finally on my 31st birthday, I admitted to myself that I wanted hrt. The genie exists, I had just been too cowardly to make the wish. So I called Planned Parenthood and made the appointment.

I don't think I would have been so rampantly sexual if I hadn't suppressed so hard. I wouldn't now cringe from being touched by people. I wouldn't have had arguments with women I was trying to date because my lack of orgasm made them insecure. I wouldn't have experienced post-penetration rape.

2018-10-04 20:39:40,9lfoug,0,1,"Hi there I’m having an issue right now and I’m quite upset and distressed by this and I really need some advice on my situation 

So I started self medicating with hormones in sept 2017 and it was a rough ride from the begging 
I didn’t have the funds to go private and I didn’t have my appointment for the nhs ( uk based ) trans clinic for 2 years so I’ve still got one year left to wait for my first appointment 

And I just felt like I couldn’t wait 
so I found a local charity called cliniq that does all blood levels for trans women and men 

So I got my levels done for the first time in September and my oestrogen was at 70 pmol/L
Whatever I didn’t really care because it was before 
They refused to test my testosterone I have no idea why and that upsets me still

But anyways 
I had a tough ride because I was on spiro which was working fairly well to begin with felt great and all 4 mg progynova a day since the beginning until now and finaesteride 1 mg too since the beggining
I soon become sick and unwell from the spiro in so many ways I can’t explain and had to come off of that 

Soon after I tranferrrd over to cyprotone acetate 
And nothing prepared me for how much this was going to effect me really...
Quite quickly within 4 months of treatment I had become withdrawn depressed anxious and tired 
I gained weight which was good for me because I’m so skinny and changes wise my boobs were progressing with growth lol .. although very slowly ... and my body hair was almost gone all over my body

I was finishing up with laser hair removal and that had been going amazingly on my face too
Maybe one more touch up but barely needed

This leads me to about 2 months ago or so when I was just so down and low I decided to give it a go without them because I was just so depressed
I had lowered the dose and cut the pills up and still no luck
Even taking it every other day 

I never took 50 mg either only 25 mg 

No luck...

Anyways so I went off of them for a while and have just re tested my levels and when I got them today I was so shocked I cried instantly 

This is how it reads 
I need some insight into this
Btw reminder I’m on 4 mg progynova 
1 mg finaesteride 


Oestradiol : 165 Pmol/L

( free androgen index )

SHBG : 28 nmol/L
Extracted testosterone 15.0 nmol/L
Test SHBG ratio 53.0

This seems like male ranges what do I do

I'm Jamie, 26, and today I told a friend that I might be trans. She was super supportive (and an absolute babe). 

I'm looking for some advice on where/what to do next.

What I know already:

* From early teens I remember being envious of girls; the way they got to dress, makeup, boobs, long hair, even the way they walked (It wasn't a 'I wanna' bang her', it was a '*I wanna'* ***be*** *he*r')
* Unsupportive parents (for anything apart from 'normal') meant I didn't talk about anything. Dad forced me into more 'guy stuff'; fighting, drinking, making fires, proving yourself to be a man, etcc. I hated it, but it became the norm after a few years
* I've struggled with my identity over the years; in terms of 'why am I on this planet?!'
* University was my first time properly away from home and I drunk so much alcohol my liver almost failed (a story for another day - I've been sober for over 6 years!), looking back I was trying to escape my returning feelings of envy 
* Over the last 6-9 months the envy towards women has come back stronger than ever before; I've wanted to *be* that woman so many times
* I'm living with a really cool flatmate (he's also a close friend) who is basically never here...
* I've been shopping online for girl clothes, which has been exciting (like, ear to ear smiling at the thought of wearing that cute dress or top!) but also scared
* I *love* how I look in dresses, tops, etc. BUT I hate looking at my shoulders/ face (in fact I re-angle the mirror so I don't have to see it - When I catch a glimpse of my face it usually makes me straight up cry, or I just stare back at the mirror because I don't recognise the person looking back)
* I get home from work; shower, shave, and put on some of my girl clothes and relax in front of the TV, cook, etc. It's basically my routine now as my flatmate is basically never here 
* I literally have two fashion wardrobes (those ones with just the metal pole?). They're at opposite sides of my room. One is for my boy clothes and the other for my girl clothes.
* The worst time of my day is getting out of bed(!) and reaching for the boy clothes

I don't want to let myself 'forget' (read: bury!) these feelings again, I've been unhappy for too many years already... but I don't know what to do next.

I  just came out to my friend that I want to transition and she was the  first and probably only person for now I will tell. It was so hard  telling her I wanted to transition I’m scared if I told everyone they  would all abandon me. I live in a very conservative state.

I  told her and she was very accepting. It felt so good for someone to see  me for who I am. I needed to tell someone. I couldn’t hide any longer.

So  after I told her she asked if there was a name I’d like to be called  and if she should change pronouns. I didn’t really know what to say. I  didn’t think this far ahead. I just came to terms that I was trans  recently. I told her this and she said ok then why don’t we just try it  out. So she asked my name. It’s Hannah btw. So she she’s send me a  message.

That I was accepted and I  had somewhere in this hell I could relax and be me.

For  anyone that have a trans friend or even just different in a certain  way. When they know you care and that you accept them for who they are.  That means the world to them and it meant the world to me when she said  my name.

2018-10-09 05:22:08,9mmfts,2,1,"Dear Co-worker, 

Sorry I worked with you all day and legit can't remember your name. I'll get it by the end of this gig...I hope. 

I bet you feel awkward. You were being kinda awkward. The most awkward moment was when you were surprised when I called my ex ""he."" Yes, he. A straight cis gendered he. But I'm not writing this to berate you for being awkward. 

I'm writing this to thank you. 

Thank you for double checking if my name was Andrea* or Andrew* and not batting an eye when I said people call me both. I don't know how you realized I was trans. Maybe it was when I used the ""family"" bathroom during the break. Maybe it's my hair. Or my pants. Whatever it was, you didn't know, but you noticed. 

Thank you for joking all day. A lot of your jokes were offensive, and I didn't like some of them, but you did make the day go a lot faster. 

Thank you for making it so that I outed myself to anyone who could hear me. I'm not really out at work because it would be a lot of explaining to a lot of people I rarely see. But you were trying to backpedal after being awkward about my ex by making a joke about Mrs Doubtfire and pronouns. Because of the banter, I felt comfortable saying that ""I'm a they"" in front of the whole crew.

Most of all, thank you for giving me shit about my pronouns. Why would I thank you for that? Well, because you used them. You didn't tell me I was weird. Or that they/them pronouns didn't make sense. You were picking on everyone all day to make people laugh. So when you said something to the effect of, ""whatever you say, *they*"" it made me laugh. You were giving me hell the same way you had been doing all day, but you were also acknowledging me and the fact that I had told you something important. (Plus, it was impressive that you seemed to process that new information so seamlessly.)

I hope you don't think you offended me. I hope that we get to talk gender again tomorrow, and that I can reassure you that you made me feel better and more comfortable being myself. I know you're not exactly PC and that you don't get all the complexities of being queer or trans or gay. But I also know that you are open, accepting, and curious in a way that means you're willing to learn. 

So thanks dude. See you tomorrow. 

-Tree

I have my first GIC appointment next month but, since leaving school (UK) and moving to university I've been unable to tell anyone I'm transgender. Something about the idea of this person *knowing I have a penis* and possibly *making assumptions about my life and I based on that knowledge* creeps me out and makes it impossible to tell them. After three years I've figured out what works for my face and I pass in day-to-day life, more or less. It's entirely plausible everyone assumes and thinks I'm transgender, but for some reason that doesn't bother me nearly as much as knowing for sure that they know they for sure... if that makes sense. But my voice is very low, and has a grating buzzing sound to it that makes me nauseous, so I never speak, I'm entirely mute in all situations, including when I'm alone. I know that with three years of voice training I could be so much closer to a passing voice today, but I made the mistake of choosing mutism long ago and now whenever I make noise I want to vomit, probably in an attempt to fill my mouth with something other than my voice.

To hide my transgenderism I've lied a lot. Generally I don't feel bad about it. These lies have no victims. Almost all of it is tactful omission. But it also involves not using social media at all, because I don't pass in photos nearly as well as in reality, and my struggle to accept my appearance is one I can't describe without involving my dysphoria in the explanation, so I can never talk about that either. Lately I've found myself getting the urge to just *stop trying to hide it*. Not to come out in some grand gesture, but to just slowly release, to let go of the deceit, and let people find out on their own. It's tempting because it will allow me to use online dating, which I currently can't use since I'd have to state I'm transgender and someone I know might see the profile, and use Facebook/Instagram/etc. the way cisgender girls do all the time like it's second nature.

But it scares the heck out of me, because I can't talk about it with anyone even if I know they know about it. If someone mentioned seeing my dating profile, for example, I'd hate that. It would make me want to die. They'd *know*. They'd know and they might no longer perceive me as the *kinda weird-looking girl* and instead as *the transgender girl*, and that would change their behaviour. I'm scared of that change, and of everyone knowing something so intimate about me, but I also just want to feel free for once. I can feel that freedom post-surgery; once I no longer have a penis, any thoughts others have about my gender will be baseless, since by all accounts, I'm fully a woman; I have a vagina, I have breasts, they can't expect more from me.

I know all women are valid regardless of their genitals. Of course they are. And they, and I, should feel comfortable and valid in their own bodies, knowing that gender isn't related to biological sex in the way we used to think it was. But in reality, and especially in dating and sex, my genitals affect me and how others perceive me. It changes whether someone hits on me, or whether they freak out when I let them know what they're about to see, etcetera. I can't pretend society doesn't affect how I feel about myself. It always will. I guess I was hoping someone could help me figure out whether what I'm afraid of is a baseless fear, or if I should keep hiding this until I'm more confident with my body thanks to the surgeries. They could be two or three years from now and I don't know if I can wait that long to put myself on social media and dating sites.

2018-10-11 21:23:14,9ne39h,0,1,"Hi kind people. I... Am not so sure what I want to say here. I am looking for a place where I can be open and honest, and have some conversations with others. I hope I came to the right spot.

Firstly, I'm a guy. I wouldn't call myself feminine-ly shaped; I'm quite broad, hairy legs and chest, big hands and a shapeless butt. For a long time I've been a heavy metal fan, among many other genres incl classic music and Irish folk music, and have had long hair since im 11.

I never rally felt uncomfortable with myself, except that I used to and still am (although less) on the fattier side of things. But that's more for r/fitness and what not.

Although I've never felt out of body, or out of place, I have been thinking about what it's like to be a girl. It started with simple curiosity when looking through catalogues of clothing shops, and always dwelled longer on the female clothes because they're more interesting (which.. They are, i guess). I was often imagining how life would be if I had been born a girl at that time too.

Life went on and I never paid much attention to it after that. That was until somewhat recently. I talked with my now ex GF about clothes and shoes for women, she suggested I should try a pair of heels just for fun. This might sound like a big jump, but in reality it wasn't so sudden. I told her I liked seeing high heels on her, and shopping for them with her as well (foot fetish included, so that's an easy sum).

When we ordered a pair we both liked, I tried them on and it excited me a lot. Not really to the liking of her, as she's more 'traditional' in that sense, well, more old fashioned. 

Anyway. There's perhaps a time gap of 10 years in between these two episodes. In the mean time I had tried a dress of my step sister at some point, looked at porn (trans/trap included from time to time), and got to know my sexual self better as years passed.

During those years I also saw a change in myself. It started with 4chan. There was a time I was a bit down and 4chan is a distraction, not a great one at that tho, but one none the less. When you're on the random bord, you will encounter trap threads. They interested me, and after the initial denial I experienced, I started to look for those threads after a while. Then not so long ago, I realised that, yes, some are men, some are trans and see themselves as a woman, but they have a penis. And so what? What's the matter with that? There's no right and wrong in this sense. If they see themselves as a woman, then that person is a woman to me. Regardless of what's there is or isn't. 

So right now I'm at a point where I would love to go on my knees both for a nice pussy, or a nice dick. And since I'm single again now, I want to do those things, and expand on my sexuality. I want to buy myself some nice heels (I returned the ones I ordered earlier) and dress up nicely with stockings and a dress.

I'm still interested in life as a woman, but I'm not sure what that means, because I am happy with myself as I am as well.

Like I said. These are thoughts that have been going on for a long time. And it's a bit of therapy to write them down, imaging that others are listening. So. If you want to drop your thoughts in a reply, I'd like that. If you got bored reading halfway and skipped to the end for the tl;dr, I have to disappoint you, its not here.

2018-10-12 08:43:51,9nikip,0,1,"Due to a higher T count than I should have had, my doctor recently changed me over to Cypro from Spiractin.

I've had a massive decrease in sex drive and now when I do ever get aroused enough to do anything my orgasm is kind of almost painful.

My earlier T-counts had been fine, but on the Spiractin, while my sex drive went through a period of death, after a few months it came back to a really nice place - definitely better than before. There but manageable.

This was the first instance of my T count being too high - but it was kind of alarming, my levels being 20 compared to my pre-HRT levels of 29. I was happy to swap over as I was hoping that maybe the too high levels of T was what had been keeping my arms, which are still very shapely, from losing more muscle mass.

At the moment I don't have a boyfriend so this isn't really an issue, per se, it's more just something I want to keep up because of the old adage with sex drive - that if you don't use it you lose it. I'm worried that I won't have any drive at all or be able to orgasm without pain when I finally get a BF.

I don't know where my current T-levels are at now that I'm on Cypro and I'll be getting them tested next week. Is this just  symptomatic of a much lower T, or even sign maybe my T is too low now?

He loved the feminine aspect of it. Over the past month or two, he's moved towards wearing women's clothes exclusively at home and has expressed interest in doing so outside of the house, but we don't live in a super liberal area so he's afraid to. Also very afraid of our families reactions, etc.

He hasn't expressed any need to go by she/her pronouns, so use he/him is still okay. He's confused, I'm confused, neither of us knows what's going to happen. He said he doesn't know if he's trans, only very very recently has he started to feel like its more than just the clothes. He said he feels more comfortable in women's clothing, and that the idea of wearing men's clothes stresses him out. I do suspect he's had these feelings for a lot longer but didn't want to express them to me.

I'm terrified that I'm doing everything wrong here, that I'm making it worse. I don't want to make this about me but I'm so scared that I won't be attracted to him.

I watch Better Call Saul and I identify strongly with the character of Jimmy mcGill before he became Saul Goodman. Not because I'm a con artist or dodgy lawyer, but because his character arc of trying to find his place in the world and be accepted I feel matches my struggles. And his trajectory of feeling increasingly overwhelmed and hopeless and bitter is how i feel I'm becoming. What do you do when you feel fucked over every time? Become a bitter bastard? Or submit to being defeated and concentrate on making the generation kick ass?   


When I was 24, and very much an egg despite feeling feminine for many years, and I looked like an average male. Anyway, the medium seemed convinced I'd transition at 35 when I was living abroad, which was quite a surprise to me given that something like that wasn't even on my radar. They said that it'd be very difficult and they were worried for me. I didn't even get what they were saying at first and i didn't really take any of it in as being 35 seemed like a century away. Maybe they cold-read something in my demeanour, maybe they got lucky guessing, no idea. I was very secretive about my quick cross-dressing inklings, and it wasn't something i wanted to share. I'm a sceptical believer regarding the paranormal. i believe in it (due to three specific instances), but i also believe that 99% of the time there is a boring, mundane and very earthly reason to anything potentially paranormal.   


Anyway, I'm 33 now, and despite battling hairloss for six years, I've finally lost the battle. It's gone from being receding to full balding in just over a year. even the thick areas have suddenly gone thin. i had stunted growth as a kid and was fairly androgynous until around two years ago, now that advantage to being feminine has also gone. I've gone past the point as to where my physicality could have assisted a decent transition.  I've just started a new job which is dull but pays well (very much a Davis and Maine situation, for those that watch Better Call Saul). There's a sabbatical option where after two years of work i can leave work for a year, this would be possible in 2020. increasingly i'm planning to save up, leave work for the year, go abroad and transition somewhere away from family and friends (probably armed with a stockpile of HRT).   


My point is that, weirdly, never in my life has it looked like i'd transition very shortly more than now. And it'd be when I would be....35. Maybe it's a self fulfilling prophecy where I've subconsciously made everything aline to match the medium's reading, who knows. But given what they said, and what I know about the world, it does seem like a transition for me would be a real shit show in any case. So, everything up until 35 now feels like some weird prequel, where I already know the end of the story and that's some sort of difficult unhappiness being trans and nearing midlife when dreams usually decay. Not the most inspiring of potential futures to wake up to. I'd just say sod it and have kids and then be a really pushy parent so they fulfil their dreams and potential no matter what the cost to them or myself, but I think that's just as unhealthy as being selfish, not having a kid and saying that I'm not done yet trying to be who i want to be - also regarding the cost.  


Probably TDR or a niche post, and no one watches Better Call Saul, so that reference is probably lost on people, but anyway, there we go.

I'd just say sod it and have kids and then be a really pushy parent so they fulfil their dreams and potential no matter what the cost to them or myself, but I think that's just as unhealthy as being selfish, not having a kid and saying that I'm not done yet trying to be who i want to be - also regarding the cost.  \n\n\nProbably TDR or a niche post, and no one watches Better Call Saul, so that reference is probably lost on people, but anyway, there we go.\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Quite a Ride', 'created': 1539566916.0}"
2018-10-14 19:26:56,9o5jmv,3,1,"   Hey, I'm a (maybe trans) kid from a liberal part of Texas. People are pretty open and kind to most of the LGBT community at my Highschool, but there are only two transgender people I know of and they're both freshman, although this shouldn't hinder me, it does. I feel like if I ask them for help with my identity, my pride will somehow be affected. I also, being a Junior, have little to no connection to them other than that they are both in my organization. On the terms of pride, I don't care that they are Freshman, I'd just say that I feel a little bit of envy that they have their stuff together and already know who they are even though they are younger than me. I also don't know if they would even feel comfortable talking to me about it and I don't want to cause any form of dysphoria by bringing up that they are trans.
  In the end I'm just struggling alone. I do have the support of some of my friends but they all believe that I am Gender fluid Because that's what I've been classifying myself as. Recently though, my friends have questioned if I was trans and I don't have a proper answer. I'm trying to figure myself out on my own but everyone is looking for answers on account of how I've been acting lately, which I understand because I stopped dressing as I use to, I shaved my head, I dropped different friends, and I've been more defensive than usual. 
""Are you depressed again?""
""Are you trans or still the same as you were?""
""Are you feeling more dysphoric or do you even feel it at all?"" 
  It's frustrating because all I can tell them is that I really don't know. I really don't know because I don't understand what the meaning of being trans is as I've never spoken to someone with similar experiences as me. 
  So I've gone to Tumblr, Instagram and now here to ask for someone to help me define what I'm feeling or even just to talk to me about this whole thing. I know you aren't supposed to talk to strangers on the internet but that's all I really have right now so I might as well give it a try. I would appreciate if someone in the trans community could give me some advice, thank you, no matter who you may be.

2018-10-19 14:53:20,9pkjku,0,1,"So we’ve been close, but I guess not as close as I thought, since college about 11 years ago. She lives abroad, but we’ve always kept in touch and I’ve spent lots of holidays with her family when she comes home. She’s one of the first people I came out to over 6 months ago, but we haven’t seen each other since Christmas. 

I’ll be real, I could tell weeks ago that she didn’t want to hear about my transition. I tried to give her space with it, but it’s impacting my life in huge ways (got divorced, moved, changed jobs, family dynamics changing), so there’s no getting around it sometimes. I’m also just really fucking happy for the first time in years, and want to share the high points with her. I also want her to see who I really am, since I was so closeted and dysphoric and dissociative in college and for years since that I pretty much just lived according to a non-offensive, non-obtrusive script. 

Without too much detail, she came home very suddenly this week due to a death in the family, and I of course went to spend time with her. She made no attempt to use my pronouns or chosen name when referring to me with her boyfriend. I was shaken, but didn’t want to make it about me when she’s under stress. 

A few hours into hanging out, we went to a store and the clerk asked where “we” were from, evidently assuming we were a couple, and she said “I’m from out of state, but *she’s* from here.” 

I was mortified, I’ll be real. I pass, and I have been passing for a couple months at this point. I use the men’s restroom, present very run of the mill male, and no one I’m still in constant contact with misgenders me, even in private. I haven’t been called “she” in months. 

The clerk clammed up, looked down at her hands, and became pretty visibly uncomfortable. My friend didn’t correct herself and I left it alone since we were leaving. 

I told my friend after we left that I needed her to try with the pronouns, especially with strangers, since they see me as male - she acted shocked and asked when she had slipped up. I told her, but in truth she hadn’t correctly named or gendered me even once since we got together that morning. “Well I’m gonna need some time!” It’s been 6 months, but okay. 

A few minutes later, she looked at her boyfriend and said, “what do you think, she doesn’t look that different from how she looked last Christmas, right?” I was hurt, but figured maybe since she’s cis she couldn’t comprehend that I’m *happy* with the changes I’ve had, but just told her that I pass well enough to use the men’s restroom without getting a second look. “It’s the voice, then,” she said. 

That was pretty fucked up on a lot of levels, but I couldn’t react at the time. 

There were several instances of this kind of flippant behavior, and tbh there have been a lot when we’ve talked online. I gave those a pass bc it was over chat and I didn’t want to read into it too much, but it’s stayed an issue and kind of came to a head the other day. I left hanging out with her feeling incredibly dysphoric and embarrassed, bc it became pretty apparent that she’s just “tolerating” what I’m going through and wanting to act like nothing has actually changed. 

I get being scared by change, but I obviously needed this enough to gamble my whole life and livelihood on it, and I lost quite a bit in the process. It fucking hurts that she’s acting like it’s a phase and that occasionally going “mm oh, right, *he* now, I guess” equals support. It’s becoming apparent that she thinks everyone in my life is just indulging me by using my pronouns, etc, and keeps rubbing it in that she can’t see me any differently and blaming it on her being unable to see physical changes (which is also absolute nonsense, because they’re pretty major).

Long story short I've never really felt like a man, and my first thought was, ""Hey, get jacked. Use steroids."" This has done nothing but make the problem far worse.


Like I think I look kinda feminine already except for being huge. Just don't want to have to get too much plastic surgery. I think I have a great ass and feminine face.

In the past day, every single picture I see of a cute girl, I just want to be them. I want to be pretty, and have soft skin, and ughhhhhh\n\nAnd I almost feel sad that I won’t ever be like that... I really don’t know what to feel I’m super confused right now. I think I should still stand by my initial attitude of not transitioning tbh. I can probably still get these experiences without transitioning with clothes, makeup, etc. ', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am I trans? (18M)', 'created': 1540167252.0}"
2018-10-21 18:26:55,9q5tyr,7,1,"Firstly: I am not invalidating trans identity in any way. nor am i asking for clarification about the line between sex and gender. im asking a specific question about the use of the sex term 'female' instead of the gendered term 'girl' in 'afab.'

So i have a question about amab/afab - i understand how the terms are used and what they mean, but why say 'assigned' a sex instead of a gender (assigned female as opposed to assigned girl)?  

I can understand how a trans person was assigned an incorrect gender at birth.

I can understand how an intersex person could be assigned a Sex.

But a MtF trans person was not 'assigned' any Sex, they were a male at birth. They were assigned masculinity or boyhood. gender is assigned, sex is not. claiming you were 'assigned' a sex (assuming you are not intersex), isn't nearly as accurate as saying a MtF is born male, is girl, is assigned boy at birth.

I realize it seems a little nitpicky but its pretty crucial and core to the way people identify themselves. So my question is where does this come from? Am i failing to realize a good reason for this?

Makes me think of god with a pencil assigning sex: ""penis, penis, vagina, penis""

Ive been in a really great relationship with a girl whom I wouldn't trade for anything or anyone.

She's told me before she's wanted to be a guy for pretty much her whole life and that she was planning in changing her name and pronouns soon, and possibly later on start using hormones and all that.

I am unsure. Anytime I've been with men, I cannot ever do it without being a girl. I don't like the term 'crossdresser', I don't hate it. I just have incredible dysphoria about it and my body as well. I don't know. Everyone I've discussed with suggested that you will have a long road to self-discovery. So I plan to find friend to live like a girl when I can.
97% of the time I am with women here. I have had incredible female sexual partners here but I just couldn't trust the men here. Only a few times I've been with men while crossdressed and it was an incredible feeling. Truly was. But also scary. Then I tried crossdressing at home and included some exercises to keep myself as close as possible towards a feminine physique. Run, squats etc. But you know the frame from the front...ahh well.
Funny thing is that I have been the listener, and counselor to my lesbian friends over here and I have helped them liberate themselves and carve a happy future for them but when it comes to me, should I just be a normal skinny guy who is into women...and just dreams being a curvy women. Well, I guess the tough part is out of the way though.

Only a few times I've been with men while crossdressed and it was an incredible feeling. Truly was. But also scary. Then I tried crossdressing at home and included some exercises to keep myself as close as possible towards a feminine physique. Run, squats etc. But you know the frame from the front...ahh well.\nFunny thing is that I have been the listener, and counselor to my lesbian friends over here and I have helped them liberate themselves and carve a happy future for them but when it comes to me, should I just be a normal skinny guy who is into women...and just dreams being a curvy women.

Sincerely, can someone please explain to me, what rights you are asking for that are separate from cis rights? Please don’t be a dismissive asshole, or be a dismissive asshole if you need to be; just answer these questions. I’m not trolling, just ignorant in the purest form of the word. Also, it’s not like any of us were socialized as children to be ready for this debate.

It may even help me explain it to people who lean right in the future if you can break down for me, what all this is about at its core.

So, I understand that being assaulted because you are transgender is wrong, but that’s assault, so we’ve got that right covered, don’t we? What are trans rights vs. cis rights and what trans rights are quantifiably different from cis rights?  

1) Are you asking for assault if it’s because you’re trans to be considered a hate crime? 2) Is it not already considered in a court of law to be a hate crime? Educate me please. 

3) What is the big deal on the bathroom thing? Do trans women really get assaulted in the bathroom by cis men? I do not get it. I’m a cis white female. Maybe people don’t assault me because they don’t hate the very idea of me, but I have been in a men’s bathroom many a time (just breaking the rules because I couldn’t wait any longer, something like that, for example at a theme park or bar) and no one has ever raped me/hit me/punched me. Usually they smirk at my bucking the rules to begin with. Exactly what is the  on using the men’s bathroom if you’re a passing or even not passing trans female? 

4) I know this may be underreported, but even so, how many cases have there been documented of trans females being assaulted in men’s bathrooms, and are those considered hate crimes?

2018-10-24 18:00:00,9r21jw,0,1,"Hi all. Like many of us in America, I'm gravely concerned over the recent developments from the Trump administration. Even if it's just talk, it's distressing to have our legal existence be a subject of debate.

Therefore, I want to try to put the news into perspective. Right now it's easy to imagine radical changes in America such as legislation that restricts or bans transition related care, and I've even heard some people half-jokingly talk about trans people being put into camps, but (as far as I'm aware) neither of those things is likely to actually happen.

This brings me to my first question: what is the actual worst that could happen? Let's assume, since this is a worst case scenario, that the Republicans retain control of both houses of congress until at least 2020. Given the current political climate, what anti-trans changes could we realistically see in the next 2 years? Please back everything up with facts; I'm asking this to try to put the fear-based rhetoric that has been saturating our community into perspective.

My second question is whether or not I should have a backup plan. Suppose the Trump administration or congress or the courts or all 3 actually put us into the worst case scenario. At what point does it become reasonable to start considering emigration? What other options are there? What countries would be the best to migrate to? How bad would things have to get for trans Americans to be considered refugees?

2018-10-24 18:10:15,9r2551,0,1,"I've been hiding who I am for about 2 years since I started exploring my identity / sexuality. A few know I've been married to a woman before, but that ended a year and a half ago (divorce just finalized, yey?). 

I work for a university, which should be a pretty safe place to be myself, but I don't have a ton of co-workers I would consider friends. They're all mostly stable, married, have children. A few are late 20s, early 30s (my age range) but again, all are straight (as far as I know) and married. A lot of them go to or talk about church, but I haven't heard anything too conservative or demeaning from them.

However, I'm getting to the point where the little comments are starting to irk me. Like, just now, a female co-worker was kind of stretching and made a yawn sound that another across the hall thought was feminine, and they both kind of joked how it wasn't me. Little tiny things, I wish I had more examples on my mind.

I feel like some of them do get the sense I'm a little feminine or a little different, but maybe they're not trying to offend me by asking who / what I'm into and just assume I'm straight and a dude? I've been growing my hair out for a little while, it's just above shoulder length. I try not to wear any collared shirts to my office, but I don't wear like tighter jeans or make-up or anything. 

I'm getting really close to hormones (about to store sperm on Friday for the first time), and I've kind of been waiting until things get started to be like ""Hey, I'm actually _____"" and ""you should call me Carrie"", but I'm not sure if that's the right method. I wish I had someone at work I could talk to, and I'm sure some or most will accept me, they just literally don't know.

Hi, first time poster here. I'm a 21 y/o trans man, and I'm currently studying abroad in a foreign country. I'm very lucky in that I was able to have my gender marker changed to M before the move, so I didn't have an issue with getting overseas. For the past two years, I've rarely been ""clocked"" by strangers, so I'm currently living stealth (not obligated to come out as trans).

Unfortunately, when you hang around young-age groups that are entirely straight and cis (primarily cis men), they get up to a *lot* of offensive jokes. The derogatory comments are almost always about trans women - mainly joking about ""traps"", leading into gay jokes. Occasionally there's also the stupid ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" line, ""Did you just assume my gender?"" and other annoying ones like it. These are people that I share a residence with, so it's hard to avoid being around them. 

So far I've bitten my tongue, either ignored it while others laughed or abruptly changed the subject, but it's becoming more and more unbearable. I hate to be the person that makes things uncomfortable, but hearing these comments every day is making me genuinely dysphoric. 

Basically, my question is: Should I come out to them so that they'll understand why the jokes bother me? I don't necessarily want to do it as a ""Gotcha!"" where the point is to make them feel bad, but more like ""I'm trans, this is making me uncomfortable, and I'm asking you to stop"".

2018-10-25 10:41:41,9r94cz,0,1,"Background: I currently identify as cis but was trans for about a year before I decided that I felt comfortable living my life the way I am. I have identified as many sexualities and haven't ever really settled on one, and prefer not to label myself. Recently I was called out and bullied off of social media for posting that Being nonbinary doesnt make you transexual. Was I wrong for this? I have always thought nonbinary was its own group and experience. I was informed that nonbinary falls under transexuality. So the question is this. Is it not wrong to appropriate the experience of someone who has such a different life? Someone who has higher suicide statistics? Someone more likely to not be accepted by their family?
I have ALWAYS believed this, starting when I realized I didn't feel like I fit in my body. When I came out as trans, my family wasn't very accepting, they were constantly trying to explain me to family members and friends in embarrassment. Eventually they accepted me, but even then it felt bregrudgingly. 
I also felt incredibly hurt by the people I thought were my friends.

To start, I'm Flynn. I'm an 18 year old ftm guy who lives with his parents. 
A few months ago, I came out to my mom and dad as a trans guy. My dad said he'd need therapy if I pursue transition if he wants to keep being my father. He also said that, even with therapy, he doesn't think he'll ever be able to refer to me as he, and that I'll always be a girl in his eyes.
My mom, probably due to her extremely conservative upbringing, had a much harsher reaction. She firmly said she wouldn't be paying for any transition and, along with saying things about how if I transition I'll always be a freak and that my late grandfather would hate and disown me, told me that I'm not allowed to transition socially or medically while I live under her roof.
Since then, I haven't mentioned anything about gender for fear of being yelled at or even punished. She acts like everything is normal, like nothing has changed, calling me she and even frequently referring to me as 'the girl'. Knowing her, I don't know what I was expecting. I'd somehow managed to trick myself into hoping that they'd accept me, which was clearly a mistake. Looking back, I'm lucky I wasn't kicked out. We've had plenty of fights since then where my gender wasn't mentioned, but was clearly the real source of tension.
Eventually, hiding who I was got to be too much for me. Despite what my mom said, I've impulsively changed my name on my social media accounts (they don't follow me) and asked my friends to use said new name. It may have been stupid, but I don't regret it. I'm trying to keep it hidden from them, as I don't currently have the means to move out and have no idea where I'd go if I could. When my parents find out, which I'm sure they will, there's going to be hell to pay.

I'm at a loss for what to do. If anybody has any advice on how to keep my social transition hidden from them, please let me know! And, failing that, if anybody has any ideas for how to deal with them finding out, that'd be great.
Thanks so much for reading all this.

The purpose of this post is to ensure I am doing everything I can to make sure this person feels comfortable with my company and the process.

I guess I should start by saying I do not actually know for certain this person is trans. I will refer to this person as a female because that is how she presents - just a normal late teenage girl. The name on her application is a typical male name, which leads me to assume she is transgender. I have not talked to her except as a customer, and have never talked about personal details.

1. When I call for an interview there will be no acknowledgement on my part that she is anyone other than the name on the application.
2. When I begin the interview, how should I address the issue of a female standing before me with a male's name? Would it be appropriate to start with ""Do you prefer Joe or Joseph"", or should I as a more general question like ""What name to you prefer to go by""?
3. Assuming she does not say anything to me about being transgender I will proceed with the interview as I would any other applicant.
4. If she does tell me she is transgender, would it be inappropriate for me to ask any questions such as ""What is your pronoun""? Would there be any others I should ask or avoid?
5. Assuming the interview goes well and leads to a job offer, would it be inappropriate to as something along of the lines of ""What can I do to make sure you are comfortable working here""? Because I would have to deal with legal documents, would it be inappropriate to ask if she will be legally changing her identity in the future?
6. If she is working here and a customer makes a transphobic comment, would it be inappropriate for me to step in and come to her defense? My initial reaction would be to handle it the same way I would if someone was sexually or racially harassing one of my employees.

I have never knowingly interacted with a transperson in the real world. I want to be sensitive, helpful, and accommodating, but I also don't want to cross any lines that would be inappropriate. Thank you in advance for answering these questions and adding any other thoughts  which might be helpful. 

My company is very open and friendly to the LGBTQ community, but we have never hired a transgender person before. Since we are a small company there are no specific HR guidelines to guide me on this issue aside from general sexual harassment training.

2018-10-26 14:53:06,9rlerc,0,1,"Folks, I need some advice...or maybe just some solidarity. I'm in my late 30s and have been an out lesbian for close to 20 years. I've always been keenly aware of the gender divide in the world, particularly in regards to its treatment of women as a lesser class of being. Growing up, I rejected a lot of stereotypically feminine things (dresses, lace, growing up to be a ""good housewife"") but thoroughly embraced others (glitter, rainbows, animals, taking down the patriarchy). I found the ""soft butch"" label to be fairly close to describing me for a while. I strongly identified with women, and still do...just a different idea of women. Fierce, powerful, take no frickin prisoners women. I would often comment on my gender though as ""I'm just me."" This is long before public discourse included words like genderqueer and non-binary. 

Then times changed. Now we do have those words. I picked up the genderqueer label pretty quickly, and had a good friend that shared this with me. We were like twins in a lot of ways. It was the first time I had someone who I thought felt the same as me. He later transitioned to Male, but is still very queer and open about what it means to be male. Since I felt this shared identity, it sent me into hyper-questioning mode. We haven't been hanging as much (due to life, not his transition) so we've drifted a little and haven't had a heart to heart on gender in a while. But the ""who am I"" questions continue to plague me. 

I'm a naturally masculine woman...narrow hips, battling facial hair since middle school...but have DDs. I dont hate my chest, but sometimes wonder if I would like a flat chest better. Even binders don't do much, and they effin' hurt. And I've not been terribly pleased with the top surgery results I see online on bigger bodies with bigger breasts. Not exactly encouraging.  

I don't care if people refer to me as he or she ...but honestly neither fits. They feels like too much work, too much constant explaining and correcting. When the others don't bother me terribly, why go through the trouble? 

There's also the nagging memory of a brief time in college, before I came out as a lesbian, when I said I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body. Seriously I had met maybe one trans person at that point and was only newly recovering from a conservative upbringing...I hung out with a lot of gay men and honestly I could be described to this day as a little flamboyant. Not sure if it was a by product of my crew or just my unique spin on life. Also, memory is hazy, and I may be overstating the length or importance of this statement. It very well may have been only a couple weeks that I said this...and shortly thereafter met my first girlfriend. I am very rarely attracted to men, but if I am, they are effeminate or gender-variant in some way. I love all gender transgressors, TBH. 

Which is why this is so confusing to me...outwardly I have all the love for all the genders. Inwardly, I may have some internalized transphobia (see conservative upbringing). Or, I am overthinking it all and I am just me, like I have always said.

2018-10-26 20:38:40,9roeqa,8,1,"Hey Y'all, MTF  


So I came out to my parents, and it did not... really go well. I'm not disowned or kicked out of the house, but I was talked over the entire time, and I feel as though I was not heard. I'm thinking of just setting up an appointment for an intake at my local LGBT center for HRT without even talking to them. I'm currently taking some space from them after coming out, it was a very emotion fueled night, and I need time to heal, but I feel as though they should know before I even start because I'm using their health insurance (I'm 22). I'm afraid that if I don't start HRT now, it will be too late, as testosterone has already done enough damage to my body and image already.

I'm thinking of just setting up an appointment for an intake at my local LGBT center for HRT without even talking to them.

2018-10-28 21:18:05,9s6uc0,0,1,"So i just want to note, this is a on throwaway account because i dont use reddit much and i was unsure about asking this, i also want to remain anonymous 

I have a friend who is going through the transition (to female) but is having quite a lot of pain in the lower abdominal area, as well as in both testicles (she has not had surgery yet to remove testicles(genitals as well, idk if that would be relevant). Shes also has had low (and irregular blood pressure). 

When we have both talked about it, i wondered about the possibility of her having both sets of organs (a uterus and ovaries, as well as having testicles). From what she has told me in the past, testosterone did not effect her very much. Not only her puberty hitting very late (late 15, nearly 16) she only had minimal changes from testosterone, her voice changed only slightly (she sounded female before hitting puberty) and her emotions were affected but that's all we really know of. What i do want to also note is that she massively changed on estrogen, that she looks fully female now and doesn't look masculine at all. On a small side note, she also had very wide hips before puberty 

When we talked about it more and were discussing what it may be (this was before she started to have lots of pain, ill explain that later in the post) she had all the symptoms of  klinefelter syndrome (Xxy) and we were both confused by that a bit, of course not really thinking about it because it wasn't a huge concern. 

I do want to note because i believe this relates to this, she has been able to reduce how much cyproterone she needs to take (she tried reducing it as it was causing her depression to be worse) and eventually was as low as taking 2.5mg daily. Surprisingly with this she had 0 problems with testosterone and she has been taking this for months with no problems, shes only recently (about 5 days ago) increased it to try reduce the pain shes been having which unfortunately it has not reduced it 

 I do want to note, she normally takes 2mg of estrogen sublingually and has returned to doing so after this

About one month ago though she did a blood test where she didn't take estrogen for 35 hours (she did still take blocker) and then did the blood test, it showed that she had around 230pmol/L of estrogen which both of us found really odd. Since then though shes had pain that comes and goes in the lower abdomen area (where a uterus and ovaries would be) as well as in the testicles (often in the right testicle and sometimes in the left). Of course at first she didn't really say too much because it didn't bother her greatly but over time it got worse and worse and i talked to her about it

Quite recently (about 1 week ago) she was hospitalized due to the pain, and was rushed to the doctors at early morning and this is whats really gotten me concerned about her at the moment. As far as I've seen the pain is only getting worse and we still have no clue what the pain may be. While I think that it may be due to her having both sets of organs I want to ask on reddit if anyone else has any ideas as to what it may be. 

What i do want to note though is she had several tests done at the hospital. They found a spot on the liver that may be cancer but they didn't believe it to be harmful. They also tested her kidneys and bladder, as well as doing a ultrasound from her abdomen to lower abdomen to see if there was anything. They found nothing wrong with the kidneys or bladder and from what she told me, the doctor spent some extra time looking at the lower abdominal region but didn't say anything about it, they did also do a physical exam on her testicles but did not find anything wrong with them. At the moment they have only focused on the spot on her liver but we dont think it would be the cause of the pain (because we both doubt the testicle pain would be caused by the possible cancer on her liver, which hasn't spread(it was 6cm). 

My friend lives in the Netherlands and often has a hell of a lot of problems with the doctors where they haven't helped her properly or ignored her completely. So far they have completely ignored her about the testicle pain and dont really seem to be focusing on anything else other than the spot on her liver. At the moment its causing her a lot of physical and mental distress and both of us are trying to find out what it may be. I honestly am really concerned and am asking here because I wanted to see what other people thought and maybe if they can give any advice as to what we could do to try find out what it is. 

At the moment she doesn't want to go back to the doctors (and i dont want to recommend it to her either) because they have been sending her in circles and its not helping her at all, only making problems worse to the point of her not wanting to try anymore, I do also want to note that shes being treated by  VUmc and as I've said, they dont seem to help at all.

So today I was talking with my family about political stuff and at one point my mom said something about the media slandering Trump. To which I said ""The media is typically wrong about a lot of things but Trump is still a bad president"". I then quoted the whole definition of gender craziness that happened a bit ago to explain why I thought that.

This is when things got bad. My mom said something along the lines of trans people wanting too much and being unreasonable. She also said ""If a guy can say their a girl can I say that I'm 20?"" That's when I started to get a bit mad and the conversation pretty much just turned into a nonsensical argument. 

At one point my asshole of a step dad said ""So what? Are you not a guy?"" I ignored him and kept talking. Partially out of anger from the question and partially out of fear of being outted. Anyway as I was talking he then said. ""This must be a new thing. You probably have to hang out with teenagers to understand it.""

At that point I was so unbelievably pissed that I just left the room while politely saying ""Your God doesn't exist"". Yeah I guess that was kinda out of nowhere but I know that they're huge Christians and would get upset at that.

I was thinking of coming out to my mom recently but now I know that I probably shouldn't. I guess it's good to know for sure that I'm not safe rather than wondering if I am or not.

I've been planning to move out and leave the state without keeping contact soon and many people have told me that that's a bad idea and that I ""shouldn't do that to my family"". But now I know for sure that I'm doing it. Fuck my family.

I always knew they wouldn't support me.

I really want Phalloplasty with UL, however I go back and fourth UL/no UL based on the fear of complications with UL. 

My questions are (I've searched endlessly and cannot find the answer):

1) if you choose no UL, can you still have a vaginectomy, and get everything ""closed up.""

2) would your natal urethra be inconspicuous (behind scrotum)?

3) Could you still get your natal T-Peen buried within the shaft (hidden).

I guess it boils down to, if you kept your natal urethra, could your new peen/scrotum be just as inconspicuous as if you had the UL?
