The list of names was long before, with a very few unisex names, because I haven't found many that would work in Germany \(pronunciation\) and a lot of typically female ones... but I've had some expectations bound to most of those names.

If you know a few Sara\(h\)s for example and they share some character traits or you always come up with someone in your mind when looking at a name or speaking it out loud, for me, it is not easy to picture yourself behind that name.

And today it just popped up \- a name i haven't seen or heard a lot, nothing comes to my mind when saying it, and also it's unisex and starting with the first letter of my choice. 

This name is like a blank canvas for me \- which I think is really important, because this whole ""figuring myself out"" is something that is moving me constantly in new directions which I wasn't aware of before I started. I think this will and should stay a process where I can move freely in any direction without a defined goal \- without something that constraints the possibilities of which kind of person I will develop into and without defining an endpoint so the development never has to stop again. :\)

I am Daric.  
I am male.  
I am your son.  
I am your brother.  
I am your nephew.  
I am your friend.  
I am Transgender.  


I was born Thursday, April 16, 1987. A happy, healthy baby with a head full of black hair.   
The doctor handed me to my mother and said “It's a Girl.” But he was wrong.  
I grew up being told “You are a girl.” But they were wrong.  
I grew up trying to fit into the box I was told I belonged in. I new something was wrong. I didn't feel right doing “girl” things, wearing “girl” cloths.  
I conformed to what was wanted of me, what was expected of me.  
I did my school work, made friends, lived my life... all a lie.  
Years later I finally “woke” up! I knew what was “wrong”. I am a boy! Everything felt “right”. I started going by male pronouns and wearing what I had always liked wearing but was told it wasn't “lady like” and now I could wear because I was a boy. I changed my name... a few times, till I found the one that was right. I felt happier than I ever had.   
I talked to Dr.s and told them what I felt, I went and talked to them for years. Finally I was able to start hormones to change my body to the appearance I felt inside. I started growing body hair and my voice started to deepen. I started passing as male without a second look. The moment you walk up to a stranger at a fast food place and they say “How may I help you, Sir?” Sir! It felt amazing being seen for who I am.  
It's not been easy at all. Life is a struggle every day being who I am. But I wouldn't change a thing! Being miss gendered at birth made me the strong man I am today. My parents raised me the way they felt that they should and I love them for that. I do not hate my parents for calling me their “Daughter”. I was their daughter but now I am their Son. It's a hard change for them to make.   
My parents taught me to respect others. I have a great respect for woman and men. We all have struggles, everyone is different and unique! We are all human! We all love and hate. But let's Love more than we hate! Let's love our Fathers, Mothers, Brothers, Sisters and Friends! Accept them for who they are, humans.

2018-06-04 01:30:15,8odgmi,7,6,"My views on gender have become a little muddled in my brain, so I’d like to pick yours to try and sort everything out. 

I believe that gender is a social construct and doesn’t actually exist. Like, it’s all fake and there’s no such thing as “feminine” or “masculine.” Objects and behaviors only hold those labels because we ascribe them to them. 

But I also believe that transgender and gender non-conforming/non-binary people’s experiences are incredibly valid and true. There is no laundry list of things that make you trans, like you are if you say you are! And our gender identity has nothing to do with our “masculine” or “feminine” traits.

So with all of that in mind, how can I believe that gender is fake while also believing that transgender people are real and that I myself am trans? I don’t identify as male whatsoever, but when I say that gender is fake then why does it matter what I identify as as long as I present myself in the way that reflects my true self?

I’ve got myself all in a tizzy over this and have no idea what to think. Honestly it’s making my coming out that much harder because I don’t even know what to say to people. Any insight, thoughts, and criticisms would be greatly appreciated. I want to hear what anyone has to say even if (especially if) it’s critical of what I’ve said.

33/masculine male/just out of a dead end relationship

At 24 I met a girl just in a regular bar, extremely attractive, petite, well spoken etc. We hit it off and on the third real date she disclosed she was mtf...I had no idea what that meant, and not even the slightest clue that she was. I asked questions she explained, told her I was still onboard and really had no idea until she said so. In our time together she met friends, family, and no one suspected or questioned otherwise. Didn't have to adjust or hide anything other than her turning down swim/beach invites with my friends.

We went back and forth on what I guess you would call the dominant role in the bedroom, if you know what I mean. She wasn't shy with it either and expected anything she did to me I would do to her, and although hesitant at first something about being dominated in that fashion by a beautiful girl was extremely erotic, as well as the obvious what I know now is p-spot stimulation. But I enjoyed being the dominant one just as much.

We were together for about 8 months and then one day she broke the news that she had been going through alot personally and job wise and decided she wanted to move to a more ""tolerant"" area. Being in the conservative south - Louisiana, I understood but finishing school and a good job of my own I could not leave.

I often think about her, the things we did. It was just a happenstance meeting that led to it and every relationship since has been typical male female. The experience stuck with me and over the years brought up strap on use with partners, not sure if it's the being dominated aspect, or if subconsciously trying to recreate. But lately I think about it more and more, I have tried to look on dating sites etc, but no such luck other than ""professionals"" that really aren't exactly what I'm looking for. I have accompanied a female friend to a local LGBT bar to scope out and not really anything in the realm of what I'm looking for.

So I guess to get to it, where in Louisiana, specifically Baton Rouge would one find a passable trans for a relationship? Maybe its the way the internet narrows the pool, but I have looked through the subs here and see so many attractive goddesses here but in real life its like finding a needle in a needle stack. Is the issue that I am desiring something so passable that I am just assuming they are when I see them, or is it what I really think, that in Baton Rouge/Louisiana there just aren't really any here.

I did see a girl on POF and wanted to message so bad but there's a severe age difference as she is 20. Other than that I'm lost. And I also severely apologize if any terms or phrases I used were insensitive or incorrect, there's a lot of terminology that goes with this and I really don't understand most of it.

2018-06-08 12:30:59,8pjhwa,1,5,"I think I have always been trans at one point and I do not know what to do.

This could be long and messy as I express myself.

When I was young, I always hated masculine activities.  I always wanted to play dolls and do girly things.  I had a phase where I would secretly put on dresses and have had secretly wished that I was born a girl.

My parents caught me and shamed me hard, eventually I became repulsed by these thoughts.

I slowly got a group of male friends and stated to be normal.  But never really connected well with them.

I was normal til about the age 16, where I became sick and became diagnosed with scizoaffective disorder after asking a girl out...and I do not why.  I only had a small crush on her and didn't care if she would reject me or not, but talking to her made something snap in me.  

I was a mess for about eight years

Then I stopped taking the medication by mistaking and was miraculously cured.  Later told I never had scizoaffective disorder in the first place.

In two years, I recovered and started being ""functional"" again.  I didn't really enjoy any of the activities I liked before, I only did them to fit in.  (Although I still cannot hold any job, it is incredibly difficult for me to give or trust anymore even for small things.)

But then I got a girlfriend.  And I felt different then I expected.  I felt envious, I think?  

We go to the mall and I litterally throw clothes for her to try on, but is that because I want her to wear them?

I visit her relatives and I would rather spend time with the women and children there, I never connect with the men at all.

I eventually got married to her, and I was more excited about it then she was.  People were weirded out by the way I acted.

And after the wedding I felt empty, really empty.

I feel like I became what everyone else wanted me to be and gave everything to please everyone else. And when I tried to be what I wanted to be, I was considered sick and drugged up to numb he feelings.

I honestly do not know what to do.  Would it even be worth it to try?  I am way to unstable to make enough money to pay to live as is now and will probably be a monster if I try to change anyway.

2018-06-09 01:36:31,8ppfv0,0,3,"Warning for a long post!!

Hi, my name is Kia. I'm afab and am unfortunately prone to bouts of depression and frequent psychosis. I wasn't really aware of other gender identities for most of my life, partially because I come from a pretty conservative family. For a long time, I've wanted to be a boy. No dysphoria or anything at the time, I just thought it'd fit me better and I liked the pockets.

Around summer when I was 13, I was invited to cosplay with some friends at a convention. I chose a male character and, even though my friends said it wasn't necessary to act like the character, I did all sorts of research into how boys typically walk and act and talk so I could 'play the part right'. I practiced the walk and tried to lower my voice and all that, even though on some level I think I knew it wasn't for the cosplay. When the day finally came, someone I didn't know used he/him pronouns for me. I didn't get why, but it had an immediate impact on me. I almost started crying because of the sheer amount of emotion I felt, it was like something unlocked. Loosely, it felt like a punch you know you deserved. Painful, but right. At the time, I excused it as having a sudden, unrelated wave of emotion. Even though I thought it might have been a result of being called he, I excused it because it didn't make any sense. I had never even heard of the concept of being trans.

The same year, I got my first phone. One of the first things I did was record my voicemail, and I recorded it trying to sound lower. I just knew it was the impression I wanted to give off and didn't know why.

When my childhood best friend came out as a trans man, it was the first time I'd ever heard of anybody not actually being the gender they were born as. I didn't fully get it, but I stood by him and did my best to support him. After a lot of research and mistakes, I've come to understand him a lot better. We're still inseparable four years later, and he's recently started HRT! As proud as I am of him for coming this far, I'll admit I've found myself slightly jealous. I'd never begrudge him his happiness of course, but I just wish I could find mine too. 

The thing is, I've had other experiences besides these three which have made me question my gender, most recently extreme discomfort with my body that's lasted for months and won't go away. It's led to a major decline in my mental state and talking about it is causing friction with a really close friend (not the one mentioned above).

Idk what to do at this point. If I do turn out to be trans, my ultra conservative family will freak out. If I'm not, how do I fix the discomfort? I don't even want to be a boy that badly, I just want this incongruous feeling to stop and I'm pretty sure being a boy would fix it even if I can't put my finger on why.

2018-06-09 10:37:46,8prz8c,0,1,"I just want to rant here because I don't really have anyone IRL to say this too. I apologize in advance, thus will probably have no structure and might not make any sense. I just want to type out anything that comes to mind.

Ever since I was little, I've always liked boys things more than the girl things my parents bought me. I always hated dresses and girly things like make up and stuff. But my mom for some reason hates the lgbtq+ community. She uses Christianity as an excuse to justify her hate so she feels like she's in the right. I can't even officially come out as a trans guy because I'm 99% sure, that if I do then I'll be kicked out. I'm so sure because just the way she talks. She says things like ""they[lgbtq+ people] are confused people possed by demons who are controlling their lives""(actual word for word quote) and has said similar directly towards me. She even tries to indoctrinate her kids to have that same hate. I'm glad I met people at school who showed that she was wrong. It's also frustrating because she's always going on and on about how black people and women don't have equal rights but then is opposed to lgbtq+ having the same rights. And is like she's directing that towards me because I've tried changing her mind, or at least seeing it from any point of view other than hers. She knows I've always worn tomboy type clothes but now I've been buying and wearing strictly male stuff. And I think she's catching on. I was buying some mens body wash and cologne. I had to lie saying it was for my friend or other wise I wouldn't be able to bring it to our house(even though I went and bought it with my own money from my own job...). I'm finally just now getting a binder. I wanted to wait so I could get a real one to avoid any damage.
I'm almost 18 so ill finally be free to be me without her.
It's been hard since the only people I know are all strict church people, so I don't have anyone that can know I'd rather have he/him pronouns and hate being called pretty, and when people pressure me into wearing a dress or make up. It's like for now, I'll I have is the internet,  but then that can't always work out. Like because no one is face to face with you, they'll say whatever hurtful comments that they want,  because they don't have any consequences. 

Why can't people just try to listen to what others have to say. If they could then the human race as a while would be some much more unified. That's why I love Detroit: Become Human so much. Not only is there a lesbian couple in the game, but they also have a strong equality message. Of course it's the android race trying to be equal with humans but, I think people should be able to apply those messages to real world things. Also The Greatest Showman,  that had a similar message. I have no idea where the fuck this is going, I i started ranting and now I'm reviewing media. In a nutshell, I'm a trans guy who has to stay passable as a girl until I have enough money to financially support myself. Once I do I'll tell my parents. If they can't stand the idea of who I am then I'll leave and move away. If they can stop blindly believing in they're religion and except me for who I am then I'll stay or move nearby. 

Sorry again, this is a horrendous couple of paragraphs with absolutely no structure, organization or anything of the sort. My literature teacher would not be happy with this. Lol

She says things like ""they[lgbtq+ people] are confused people possed by demons who are controlling their lives""(actual word for word quote) and has said similar directly towards me. She even tries to indoctrinate her kids to have that same hate. I\'m glad I met people at school who showed that she was wrong. It\'s also frustrating because she\'s always going on and on about how black people and women don\'t have equal rights but then is opposed to lgbtq+ having the same rights. And is like she\'s directing that towards me because I\'ve tried changing her mind, or at least seeing it from any point of view other than hers.

I know people can't tell but I often find myself wondering whether or not they could, looking for every little sign I can. I don't find any signs that they do but my brain tells me otherwise. 

It tells me everyone is just being nice to me because there's no way anyone looks at what I've seen in my mirror and thinks woman... Sometimes I don't feel that way or see it at all... but lately I have more then usual.

I try to remind myself that I have nothing to worry about but it's so hard from me. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder years before transitioning.

My friend thinks it's just because I haven't been full\-time very long and she's probably right. I just moved to a new town and I'm trying to be more confident now that I'm away from those who treated me badly in my hometown and I am doing a bit better but I still want to be more confident.

I'm wondering if anyone else has felt this way. If so, how did you cope with it and what can I do to make myself realize that I'm able to just be a woman now??? Is this something that just goes away over time? Any advice would be appreciated.

Sorry if this is not the appropriate place to post this but I figured this was the best way to get an answer from people who can hopefully answer without judgement. I’m sorry if I’m using the wrong pronouns anywhere...Im still learning.

If I said “she was so talented”, I’m assuming that’s offensive as I’m using the wrong pronoun, right?

So, my boyfriends dads side of the family has acknowledged that he’s transitioning (FTM) but they still don’t use the proper name or pronouns when talking to or about him.

2018-06-12 18:36:58,8qleyr,0,1,"Obligatory nerd reference out of the way first ;)

Hi, I'm Jamie, a 28 year old woman from Georgia (in the US, to avoid confusion). I can now say I've officially introduced myself as a woman! So, how did I get here? Well, if I told you my full story it would take way too long, so let's just limit it to my gender self discovery, okay?

In the summer of '89 in Atlanta, I was born. My genitalia is an outie so they put an M down on my birth certificate, gave me a guy name, and treated me like a boy. My whole life I've been expected to fulfill this mythical calling of a man. I always felt so disconnected from that role though I never had a way to place my finger on it, didn't have the words yet to say that I didn't feel like other boys and liked being around girls better.

Well, in a moment that now was totally like a second birth but at the moment should have been the death of me (actually, it was, a start of a slow death of the boy me and the birth of the girl me) I had to wear my sister's underwear one day. I actually discovered that they were nice. I wanted her underwear, though I couldn't tell anyone, boys don't want girl underwear.

It was middle school that girl me started to come out a little more. I would experiment with my sister's clothes and spend what felt like hours in front of the mirror looking like a weird boy. What boy would stuff a bra? What boy would know to hide his penis in a pair of panties? What boy would even want to look that much like a girl? Well, it turns out that boy wasn't a boy after all. She just didn't know.

When I finally got access to the internet in the house in high school, I discovered this whole world of people born like me. I still fought it for several years later. I have slowly ""adapted"" into the ways of being a man but it feels so much like an act and is finally coming to a head. I am not a man, this role is not for me. I can't fathom growing old as a man, a husband, any of the male titles.

When I am with friends, I feel so disconnected. When I am, in rare moments, able to feel comfortable enough to express myself closer to my true identity, I feel so much more...alive. It's like all the parts of me that are forced to stay hidden are able to just flow out. When I am able to think of myself as a woman, I feel like I can visualize, to an extent, being with someone as their SO, having a home that we share, hanging with the girls on the weekend, that type of stuff.

Overall, being a man kills me, being a woman brings me to life. Being a man feels like a chore despite being easy. Being a woman, despite being hard, feels so much more of what I want. I can't see forcing my body into a more masculine path. I would love so much to just, when I'm hanging with girls, be seen as one of them.",trans,Hello world!

I could  bent her sexy ass over my car in the parking lot  but that's not very discrete lol so we went up. She sounded so feminine and was dangerously female passable. She could tell I was nervous but also super into her  , I threw my money on the table and we went to her super soft bed and wasn't long before my clock was being sucked so good my heart was racing. I started playing with her tight ass, making me harder. She then said we need lube which I never used before and didn't know how good it would feel on the bare tip of my cock, so good I almost came instantly while she used her thumb to massage the very top of my dick driving me nuts (I was also slightly stoned for my anxiety)so this had me on cloud nine while I asked her to spit more and she complied( I was so nervous about stamina but surprised myself and used my whole hour and wanted more) was not long before I needed to put my throbbing spit and lube covered cock so deep in her ass (with a condom) and she also rode me like a hometown fucking cowgirl she even had a hat to compliment, after 30 or 40 min of hard fucking  and heavy friction she told me with her pretty smile that she loved facials and I couldn't resist pulling out taking my condom of and trying to aim for her face but getting so excited with her looking righ in my eyes and came on her perfect new tits "", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'First time Trans experince !!', 'created': 1528911622.0}"

I’m a 25 year old male who has recently began having thoughts of being the opposite sex. These feelings have come as a bit of a shock because I believed the narrative that transgender individuals always knew they were transgender to some extent. I’ve always been a fairly feminine male growing up and I don’t conform to male gender roles. I’ve always disliked my body, I’m not what you would define as masculine. I always felt that the dislike I had for my body was due to not fitting into societies expectations of what males should look like physically, but now I don’t know. I’m struggling to understand if these feelings are just my general dislike for my body or something more. 

The thoughts of wanting to be female have been increasing and I feel like I may not be coming to terms with a lot of this. I’m thinking about being seeing a professional to help me make sense of some of my feelings. This may sound silly but I’ve spent the last hour uploading different photos of myself into a an app to see what I would look like as the opposite sex. The results definitely produce a feeling inside me that more than just curiosity, but I can’t define it. One of my friends put makeup on me once and it felt right. I knew something was there afterwards, but I kind of suppressed it. when I start looking into the whole process of transitioning it scares me. I know these thoughts aren’t healthy to bottle up.

I got some long board shorts from Maui Rippers that look like they're from the men's department but the also fit my big ol' hips/butt. https://www.mauirippers.com/aqualani-9/

2018-06-26 18:59:01,8u2o08,1,3,"Hi, I’d say that I’m pretty new to all this, so forgive me if this seems long winded, or rambly. I just need to vent a little. If you've heard it all before, go ahead and skip down to the last few paragraphs. 

Ok...I have Gender Dysphoria... I’ve never admitted that to anyone but myself, so why not anonymously announce it to the internet. As a little background, I'm 25 and biologically male.

Ever since I was little I was envious of girls. Not for any concrete reason that I can identify, I just knew that I wanted to be one. I would stay awake late at night thinking about what it would be like if I just woke up tomorrow as a girl. The intensity of those desires has come and gone throughout my entire life, and at times I’ve gone for stretches where those feelings seemed to go away entirely… But looking back logically they never really went anywhere, they just weren’t causing me distress at those particular moments.

My feelings really came to a head these past two weeks. My dysphoria was pretty bad, but not directly disruptive so I didnt attribute how Ive been feeling to it. I felt anxious, lethargic, moody, and depressed, but I couldn’t really put a finger on where any of that was coming from exactly. Everything came crashing down when I was with my girlfriend and, looking at her I felt the attraction I always had but it was completely washed over by envy. I felt guilty having those thoughts about her, and the resulting anxiety has actually put a strain on our relationship since then. Those feelings were definitely conflicting, and I thought doing some soul searching and introspection would help me feel better but it only sent me spiralling down a crashing wave of dysphoric emotions that are more painful than I have ever felt. I feel lost, angry, and confused at why I have to feel this way and I know that my situation is not unique. I’ve been reading up on various threads on a number of trans subreddits and I know there are many out there who feel exactly the same as me,  but despite the overwhelming support that this community shows, it only further conflicted me. 

I’m at a point where I’m not quite sure what to do with myself anymore. While part of me feels that transitioning may be the right path for me, and is open to that, another feels that I just need to be more in tune with what specifically is causing my dysphoria, and accept it as a part of myself rather than resist it. I’m also completely terrified of the thought of transitioning because:

A) I’m a pretty wide built guy, so I know I would always look masculine and 

B) It has always seemed like a very extreme solution to dysphoria which from my lurking on various threads I found may never go away. So much effort put in, so much stress, only to feel the same way out the other side just isn’t something that I feel comfortable going through. Especially if there are less invasive ways to address how I feel. 

Another part just wants it to go away and embrace my assigned gender, because all things considered I do enjoy being a man. Ok... so I may not be an expert here but I’m pretty sure that last one isn’t really an option at this point, and that itself causes significant distress. I don’t hate how I look, or any specific feature about myself. There is always just that nagging urge that tells me its not right. I’m not sure how I can better describe it at this time. I also know that I am not equipped to handle those kinds of questions on my own, and I think that therapy is likely the best bet for figuring any of this out, but I don’t really know where to start with that either… or how to explain that to my girlfriend if I start going haha.

The real reason I’m writing this today, despite that massively overwritten opener, wasn’t just to vent. I promise there is a question buried in here. Probably several! 

I want to tell my parents. I know they will be supportive, even though I know initially they may not fully understand or believe me… But I’m just not sure how to start up that conversation, or what I am looking to get out of it. “Hey mom and dad, I’ve always wanted to be a girl, surprise!”

Where am I supposed to take the conversation from there, when I’m not even sure of what I want? Is it even worth talking to them about it yet? Or is there anything I can do to keep looking inward to help alleviate these feelings for the time being? I know those kinds of solutions are temporary but I think temporary relief is all I can hope for at this particular point in my life.

2018-06-27 20:26:27,8ud1ph,4,6,"**""Free Speech"" online now mainly protects and enables harassers, bullies and copyright trolls.**

My creative genre is science fiction. You've probably heard of [Star Wars actresses](http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/star-wars-has-a-white-male-fandom-problem) Kelly Marie Tran and Daisy Ridley being bullied off of Instagram.

And then there's the [homophobic mess surrounding Millie Bobby Brown](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/millie-bobby-brown-acceptance-speech-bullying-mtv-awards-twitter-exit-1202850220/), when she is explicitly anti-homophobia and actively working to end that kind of behaviour. She was bullied so badly that she decided to delete her Twitter.

Always notable is the case of [Leslie Jones](https://www.etonline.com/news/193824_leslie_jones_makes_triumphant_twitter_return_after_racist_attacks), bullied off of Twitter by racists and misogynists after starring in the all-female Ghostbusters reboot.

These are famous, influential people. The average person can't even get media attention for the harassment they endure, much less call for change. So what happens? Most people stay quiet, disengage, or never contribute at all.

""Free speech"" online has been perverted to mean ""free to bully"".

**""Free"" means ""No one really cares -- and we're selling your identity.""**

There is no such thing as free.

On the internet, the computers that run your favourite websites need electricity. That costs money. They need technicians to keep networks running. That's expensive, too.


Who pays for all that technology? One way or another, you do. Either you pay upfront, or companies like Facebook (which owns Instagram and Whatsapp) [¹](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/19/technology/business/facebook-data-breach/index.html) [²](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/19/technology/business/facebook-data-privacy-crisis/index.html?iid=EL) [³](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/business/Facebook-Fact-Check-Doesnt-Sell-But-Profits-Off-Data-479327543.html), Reddit, and Twitter collect your personal data behind your back and sell it to anyone willing to pay. Your information is sold to data brokers -- and that data is often used to bully people, [even to the point of suicide](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/06/woman_who_set_self_on_fire_in.html). As in the case of Chloe Segal, a transgender artist suffering from severe mental health issues, [Facebook was part of the online harassment campaign that led to her death](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/chloe-sagal-suicide-cyberbullying-harassment/).

For vulnerable populations like minorities, women, neurodiverse and LGBT people, that can translate into real-life harassment, [blackmail](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/blackmail-online-sextortion-suicides-videos-photos-sexual-police-advice-a8337016.html), and even sophisticated campaigns to [manipulate the way you vote](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/3/19/1750191/-Facebook-and-Cambridge-Analytica-gave-Steve-Bannon-a-psychological-warfare-tool-to-attack-America).

Another way that ""free"" costs is in moderated communities like Reddit. When an idiot accuses you of being an ""alt-right libertarian nazi"", moderators have no incentive to ban them. Why? Because if one person gets digusted at being harassed, it's actually better for the moderators. Helping one less person is just one less hassle to deal with. Who cares if one person leaves, as long as the subscriber count still shows that your subreddit is popular? By contrast, if you're paying five dollars per month, you can tell your friends and they can tell their friends; creators of a paid service have a real incentive (i.e. money) to keep you happy.

**Creating an alternative**

The problem isn't a lack of anti-harassment tools. The problem is culture. If the culture is rotten, the burden is unfairly placed on the wrong people to constantly fix a broken system.

""Free speech"" online now means ""rules are non-existent or inconsistently enforced; harassers and bullies are free"". ""Free"" means ""no one cares and no one will help you"". When bullies brag that their victims need to ""grow a thicker skin"", their victims just leave instead. It's not because they're too ""soft""; it's because most people have better things to do than be harassed by bigoted idiots online. Think of how many worthwhile ideas are silenced by accommodating the worst and not helping anyone else.

So there needs to be an alternative.

A new project has been underway for the past few months. We have have a set of fundamental guidelines in place.

This post has already become a lengthy blog entry, so for now, here's the main question:

I'm currently 15 (turning 16 in a month) and I kinda always had the dream of being a girl, as I thought it was way more ""fun"" and enjoyable than being a boy / man.

I barely remember it, but in 2015 I got flashbacks to it. In 2016 I started really noticing things about myself. I don’t like my body. I know I’m attractive. I don’t like having a vagina. I don’t like having boobs. I’m pretty flat, but god, it sucks! As a kid I’d wear boy clothes. I’d also wear pink sparkly stuff because sparkly stuff is pretty dang cool. However, I stopped loving sparkly things and the color pink as puberty hit me. In 2016 around the same time I started questioning my gender I began to like glitter and pink again. This time I only like pale pink. I saw lots of boys wearing that color and I just wished I could pull it off like them. 

I wish I had a penis. I wish I had abs. I wish I had facial hair. I wish I was taller. I wish I was a man. Anytime I see a male celebrity or any man I feel attracted to them. It’s an attraction that’s like “I want that” and “let me be you”. I only like girls and have only ever been attracted to girls. I’ve had the same girlfriend since 2015 and we’re long distance. She knows about this and is very accepting and warm about it. She does everything she can to make me feel comfortable and so do my friends. 

I’m too small for men’s clothes, sadly. I want to wear them so bad but my grandma doesn’t want me to do this. I feel like I’m in a costume when I wear girl clothes. I would feel natural in men’s clothes. Thinking about wearing a suit or an outfit designed for a male almost feels like a relief. 

As a kid I assumed puberty wouldn’t apply to me. I wouldn’t get a period. Why would I? And when I was younger than that I thought I’d just grow a penis. I loved cars. I still do. God, I love cars. 

I’m sorry if this is messy or silly. I’m just confused. I know only I can tell myself who I am. I just need some guidance. Did anyone else haha a similar experience? Do you think I could be trans? My friends think so and so does my brother who is also trans. He’s older than me and recently started T and I’m so happy for him but also felt strangely jealous.

I've been on full HRT for 6 months (4 mg beta estradiol in the morning, 200 mg teva spironolactone in the morning, 200 mg teva spironolactone at night) and I was one just spiro for a month or two before I started full HRT. Despite being on HRT for 6 months, and seeing multiple images of trans folks pre-hrt or on hrt for only a couple months with beautiful results and who pass wonderfully, all I have to show for it are barely-A cup breasts (expected by this time), and almost nothing else. I don't notice any differences in my face, or in my skin, or anything else really. I begin uni (B. maths hon.) in sep. and start a job in a couple days, and both of those stacked on top of eachother, knowing full well that I don't pass in the slightest, just terrifies me. 

Over the past couple months, I've just been mentally feeling worse and worse. I've been crying for almost a half hour each day (a big jump from even a month ago), and I had a breakdown a couple days ago, locked myself in a car while crying uncontrollably for 2 hours, begged my father to drive me to a crisis center (none of them were open :/ ), and cried myself to sleep with a plastic bag, duct tape, and sleeping pills beside me (you can probably guess what I was planning to do with those). I fell asleep from the sleeping pills before I could do anything with the other 2. 

I genuinely believe I won't ever pass.

FFS isn't covered by any insurance, and I don't have the money to drop on it, and probably never will. I probably won't be able to take the recovery time off work either.

Every time I see someone who I think looks pretty, whether or not they're trans, I almost always start sobbing uncontrollably. 

I'm 99% sure that the only person I've genuinely loved isn't interested in me (and there's nothing wrong with that, all power to them, but it just piles on top of everything else that makes me miserable)

I'm going to be on a residence floor for girls only (since men terrify me) and I'm very very worried that I'll be harassed or given looks or not accepted.

Among a plethora of other things, I honestly have no reason that I would want to continue living. I have no idea what to do and I really just want to give up at this point, but I'm too fucking afraid of pain or being found in the act to actually off myself so I'm kinda just stuck, being miserable every single day.

So, here goes.\n\nI've been on full HRT for 6 months (4 mg beta estradiol in the morning, 200 mg teva spironolactone in the morning, 200 mg teva spironolactone at night) and I was one just spiro for a month or two before I started full HRT. Despite being on HRT for 6 months, and seeing multiple images of trans folks pre-hrt or on hrt for only a couple months with beautiful results and who pass wonderfully, all I have to show for it are barely-A cup breasts (expected by this time), and almost nothing else. I don't notice any differences in my face, or in my skin, or anything else really. I begin uni (B. maths hon.) in sep. and start a job in a couple days, and both of those stacked on top of eachother, knowing full well that I don't pass in the slightest, just terrifies me. \n\nOver the past couple months, I've just been mentally feeling worse and worse. I've been crying for almost a half hour each day (a big jump from even a month ago), and I had a breakdown a couple days ago, locked myself in a car while crying uncontrollably for 2 hours, begged my father to drive me to a crisis center (none of them were open :/ ), and cried myself to sleep with a plastic bag, duct tape, and sleeping pills beside me (you can probably guess what I was planning to do with those). I fell asleep from the sleeping pills before I could do anything with the other 2. \n\nI genuinely believe I won't ever pass.\n\nFFS isn't covered by any insurance, and I don't have the money to drop on it, and probably never will. I probably won't be able to take the recovery time off work either.\n\nEvery time I see someone who I think looks pretty, whether or not they're trans, I almost always start sobbing uncontrollably. \n\nI'm 99% sure that the only person I've genuinely loved isn't interested in me (and there's nothing wrong with that, all power to them, but it just piles on top of everything else that makes me miserable)\n\nI'm going to be on a residence floor for girls only (since men terrify me) and I'm very very worried that I'll be harassed or given looks or not accepted.\n\nAmong a plethora of other things, I honestly have no reason that I would want to continue living. I have no idea what to do and I really just want to give up at this point, but I'm too fucking afraid of pain or being found in the act to actually off myself so I'm kinda just stuck, being miserable every single day.

2018-06-30 13:08:51,8v1qik,4,1,"Hi everyone!

I’ve been scrolling through this subreddit for a while and decided to make a account as I’ve recently started questioning my gender identity and I wanted to talk about my experience - I’m a 22 year old female.

So far I’ve been doing most of my research through the trans community on youtube and a few blog posts here and there that I’ve found through late night googling

I’ve been aware of the trans community since I was around 16/17 but I hadn’t really thought it applied to me up until a few weeks ago.

I’ve always had issues with self confidence which I know is something many people struggle with. In terms of my body, I don’t feel like I hate it but when I look in the mirror it just feels like it’s ‘there’ and that’s it. I’ve never felt a sense of pride when looking at my features. I don’t mind my chest but I know I’d prefer if it wasn’t there, it just feels like it gets in the way at the moment.

Deep down I feel like I’ve never really been able to relate to girls. I was always a tom-boy, would always gravitated towards the boys clothes section or toy sections of shops when I was little, and have always picked boy avatars/characters in video games.

I’ve never felt comfortable in clothes that are ‘girly’ - dresses and skirts always seemed strange to me, and whenever I’m in a clothes shop with friends I never see the appeal of the women’s section. I’ve been shopping in men’s sections for shirts and t-shirts since I was old enough to go out and buy my own clothes. When I’m wearing a masculine outfit I’m proud of is when I feel most confident.

I’ve never worried much about shaving, whenever I’ve shaved my legs (which is usually only when it gets hot in summer) I’ve always found it quite a hassle and just thought ‘can I not just leave them like this and wear shorts anyway?”

Another factor that I’ve been thinking about is I don’t think I’ve ever had a female role-model. (I’m going to use musicians as the example for this as I’m a musician and in a band and I find it the easiest example to explain.) Whenever I would watch videos of bands with female members in I’d always think ‘oh she’s really cool, you go girl!’ But I would often look at the male members of the bands (mostly the bass players as I play bass) and think ‘wow he’s awesome I’d love to be like him!.’ I can certainly look at women and admire them for who they are and what they do but I’ve never felt like I could really relate to them

In terms of my name, I don’t dislike it but I don’t think it feels right, at least not in more recent years. I was speaking to a close friend about all of this earlier today and trying to explain my feelings towards my name and she summed it up quite well by saying ‘Is it almost just a word people use to get your attention?” and that’s exactly how it feels.

I’m sure there’s more points I could write down but these are the main ones that are coming to mind now. This is all extremely new for me to talk about so sorry if a lot of it has just been me rambling on!

I’d love to get opinions from you guys and possibly some advice too as I’m still trying to wrap my head around everything
