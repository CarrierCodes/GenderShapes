I was wondering if HRT has ever been used as a means of exploration rather than a means of transitioning when someone KNOWS they want to transition. I am really unsure of what I identify as right now. I was raised as a boy and I am at a point in my life where I feel that I may identify as a woman, or perhaps non-binary. I feel as though dysphoria may be making it difficult to tell if I don't like the way I look as a woman because of the underlying masculine features. So I was wondering, since HRT is a reversible thing if you decide to stop, does anyone use HRT to determine whether or not they enjoy being more masculine or feminine? Or is it only something to consider when you are completely in touch with your identity. Thanks! :)

2018-01-06 18:20:33,7okvd9,10,16,"(Some samples of negative mental voices in here)

AMAB. For a while now I’ve had this thought pop up in my head from time to time. “Ya know, self, you’ve never really liked your gender. You’ve always thought of it as something foisted upon you. Resented that even. Ever considered that you might be trans?” And I’d smile and nod. “Good thought, self, there are some solid points there and it warrants more consideration” and I’d put the topic aside and merrily go about my life for a while until it popped up again.

A few days ago it was cold outside and I was bitching about it to an online friend when she responded with something like “Girl, go get a sweater!”. She doesn’t know me in real life, I don’t have any pictures of my face online, and I choose not to display my gender. She might not even know that I present male and so this wasn’t a joke, I was being mis-gendered. But my reaction to being mis-gendered was not neutral, it was positive. Being referred to as a girl somehow felt good. “Hey self, why does this feel good?” . . . “OH, FUCK ME” Then a bomb went off inside my head.

Since then I’ve been a wreck. I’ve read enough at this point to realize that the resulting panic is pretty normal. Such as “Oh my god, this can't be happening. This can't be real. You can’t be serious. Stop. Just stop it.” One part of my brain basically running a slideshow of memories of all the things I’ve said, done, or thought that point towards my being trans. The other half of my brain reacting to every word from the first with pitchforks, torches, and crying sessions. In an attempt to resolve the conflict I even started logging them to a spreadsheet. First column: things that point to me being trans. Second column: place for reactionary brain to get out it’s panicking, venting, and curse words. Third column: arguments that I’m not trans. I don’t know if it helped but either way this turns out for me, that spreadsheet is going to be a very amusing read later in life.

And of course the doubts of if this is even real or i’m just losing it. But if there was no validity to the idea i might want to change my gender, then why am I freaking out. If i’m not trans, then why won’t this thought let me go. Why would I be losing sleep over this, and why is there a civil war going on inside my head.

One of the biggest hang ups i’ve had is that so much of the narrative around transitioning, at least from the outside, is ‘becoming who you really are’ and ‘leaving your old self behind’. That being trans is going to change _everything_ and you should be happy about it. But even if you’re not happy with your current life, that is a massive bucket of anomie to dump on someone. There is a fear that things won’t be better, sure, but there is also a (to me, greater) fear of losing yourself along the way. That who you are will no longer be recognizable in who you are to become.

But there is a response to that which shows up in basically every thread, it just took a while to get through to me. I don’t actually have to do anything about these feelings. That its OK to feel them and act or not act on them as I choose. That i could say, “I really love low color saturation and that’s not manly but so what fuck you”, and still also say “You know what, eyeliner is really just too much right now. No, I don’t want to do that”

I still don’t know what trans is or what it means on a personal level. I still don’t know. And part of me is still calling this whole thing an absurd dream that I will wake up from at some point. I do know I’ll try experimenting with clothing a bit. Maybe dig up my good looking earrings and nail polish.* But that’s it. That’s all. I’ve done more for a Rocky Horror showing than just that. But then it was a ‘game’ and this time its real. Does this make me trans? No, maybe, but mostly who cares. If I like it then i’ll keep doing it. If I don’t then I’ll stop. If I want to do more I’ll do more. What label people want to put on that doesn’t really matter right now. That word is no longer a threat to me.

As a bit of an aside, I think the trans community can improve how it deals with prior selves. Deadnames, dead identities, that prior selves are dead. I understand why people think and why people feel that way. I understand that for some people that is explicitly the point, or is a lynchpin in how you think about transitioning. And I’m not objecting. But at least for me and perhaps people like me, I need to be able to draw a contiguous line from who I was, to who I am, to where I’m going. So if trans is the way i’m going, and I don’t know that yet, then the current me doesn’t have to die to get there.

Just change a little.

Transgender identifies as male

There is no way, shape, or form my legal name is unisex. I've read a few places online that you don't *have* to use your legal name on a resume, but you will be required to provide it for background checks.


My chubby, baby face doesn't let me pass, but my voice has dropped, and I'm having to shave my face almost daily. So I don't want to go in to interviews with a girly name, and then open my mouth and the interviewer is like ""where is the ventriloquist??""


I don't want them to really see me as a ""trans man"" I just want them to see me as a guy hoping to get a job with their company. I don't want to get deadnamed, and misgendered. 


Then I keep thinking I don't want to """"""trick"""""" a potential employer by using a name that isn't legal (yet).


If I use my legal name when applying, when is an appropriate time to tell them ""hey, I know my name is legally this, but this will be my name and these are my pronouns""?

2018-01-13 02:44:51,7q1u6j,3,17,"I get it, you’re freaking out a bit, emotional, and you need an answer right now. So you post up a long list of all the things you think might or might not mean you’re trans, begging for validation. And the internet happily obliges. Some people will say yes, some people will say no. But please don’t listen to them because here’s the thing, no one can tell you.


Let’s play a game. I want you to ask me to tell you what your favorite color is. Say to me “What is my favorite color?” Go ahead, ask. 


I don’t know.


If I were a street performer, I would look to see if you’re wearing blue, green, or purple, and if so tell you green, blue, or purple. Because statistically most people have one of those as favorites, and if you are presenting one of those colors it’s enough to make a guess. But it’s still a guess, and you’re not happy with that answer so you tell me stories about all of the times you’ve been wearing green but saw something blue that you really really wanted. Or that your parents like it when you wear green and you liked making them happy. Or the time you took a green thing and painted it purple. And that time that you were wearing yellow and were just happy wearing yellow. So you tell me stories and stories and stories and again ask me “Please tell me, I really need your help right now. What is my favorite color?”


I don’t know.


I’m not you and I can’t see inside your head. With every story you told there’s an undercurrent of emotion and related thoughts that will never be conveyed by words alone. So the most someone can get from your stories is a shadow play of what you truly feel. Not enough to come to a conclusion. And beyond that, human memory is just kinda shitty at remembering things. Shocking, I know.


So asking us will never be able to tell you what *your* answer should be to something as fundamental as who you are. And anyone who tries to tell you with confidence who you are is just being an asshole.


But please. PLEASE. Keep asking.


Current estimates place the trans population at roughly 0.5% of the general population. That sounds small, doesn’t it. But that’s 1 in 200 people. I easily pass 200 people on my way to work each day. And when compared to the populations of regions, nations, the world itself… There are millions of trans people out there. And they all know how hard this is.


No matter how frightened or angry or depressed or conflicted you’re feeling, millions of people have stood where you’re standing right now. Millions of people have been there and know exactly what you’re feeling. And an untold number more have also questioned and decided that they don’t need to change.


So we know how important this is to you and we’re right here. You. are. not. alone.


I may not be able to tell you if you like blue or green or yellow or purple or no color or a color that we don’t yet have a word for. But I want to hear from you. I want to learn from and connect with you. Trans or Cis or LGB or anywhere in the alphabet soup, I want you to feel safe, welcome, and happy. I want to hear, *from you*, who you are.

I bought a chest binder.
I hate my house.
I hate my mom.
I'm not really feeling the ""this isn't right and I hate my body"" kind of dysphoria. I'm just really angry that this is what I have and it's wrong- most of the time anyway. Sometimes it's the other kind.
I mean, things are decent. I sleep a lot, or I want to sleep a lot. Either one. Mom tells me I'm anorexic but I'm suffering depression and dysphoria and not dysmorphia. 
I guess this is more like a journal entry... Maybe I'll make more?
I don't think anyone really gets inside a trans teen's head, just a random thought.
I turn 18 this year, I'm excited. 
Does this count as a personal agenda?
If someone tells you that they can't use your preferred name or pronous, ask then why they can't. I mean, they have a mouth, vocal cords (assuming they're not mute). They can call you what you want to be called, they just won't. Why don't you just be un-apologetically you?

2018-01-15 03:52:29,7qh3tk,13,1,"So, I'm a cis writer. I have family connections with the queer community, but no personal friends who are trans -- so I'm asking Reddit. 

I'm writing a novel in which one of the minor characters (""Jene"") is a transwoman. She's about 29 years old.  She's my main character's best friend, and they've been close since high school. 

Here are my questions: 
The story doesn't discuss Jene's transition, but at age 29 she's pretty well-put-together and self-confident. My main character, who's a cis straight woman a couple years younger, really admires Jene for her strength and certainty about life. Jene makes a few references to her past struggles, but her personal history is not the focus of the scenes where she shows up. 

So one question I have is: I'm aware of what an odyssey it is for someone to transition. Is it reasonable to present someone who is 29 years old and has really put her life together in a good strong way? Or would a person of that age inevitably still be struggling with the whole giant life-change of transition? Jene is a professional photographer, an energetic dancer, single at the moment but gregarious and pretty engaged with life. She lives in Seattle, so she's got a good community environment. 

I guess a related question would be: What are the main challenges facing transwomen who are already transitioned? Maybe dating? Or contemplating options for future parenthood? 

My second question is: My main character, Bridget, was a shy girl in high school who loved chess and sci fi and all things digital, so she hung out with the nerds. Jene (who was Gene back then) was seen as a weird kid because he was struggling with feeling like a girl, and the two of them became buddies. The friendship only strengthened as Gene transitioned to Jene. Is there any reason why this sort of friendship would seem improbable?

In general, is there anything I should be aware of in creating a trans character? Again -- she's only a minor part of the novel -- I wouldn't feel like I have the right to create a trans protagonist -- but I just want to get her right.

Some of my earliest memories are of myself starting kindergarten and crying myself to sleep at night because I felt like god (who I then believed in) had messed up by making me a boy when I should have been a girl. I can remember asking god if I could spend even one day as a girl I would trade away the rest of my life for that one day. I never told anyone about that until about two years ago I told my long term 6+ year girlfriend how I have always felt I was born the wrong sex and she was very supportive. She isnt in the picture anymore because of unrelated reasons, so I'm back to basically being the only person in my life who knows how I really feel about myself.  I'm only attracted to women, so I guess I kind of wished I could have been a lesbian in what would have been my ideal reality. I have never had any personal desire to transition to female, even though I support people who want to and if it brings them happiness then I am truly happy for them, but for myself I think it would just make me feel even more outcast, I am very masculine looking and at this point I dont think any amount of surgery would ever make me feel outside like I've always wanted to be inside. I wish that I had told my father when I was a child how I felt, my dad has always been the only supportive loving person in my life, He doesnt know about this but I know he would have understood and maybe I could have been put on puberty blockers or something until I was old enough to decide, I think that would have been the only scenario I would have considered transitioning. As it stands now though I already hate being alone and have always kind of hated who I am, the best I am currently hoping for is to find love with a woman who will accept me for who I am, on the one hand alot of the women I have been with have ended up really falling for me, especially before I started admitting to myself about my identity issues, I think due to how I tend to be very sensitive and deeply emotional in relationships but on the other hand its harder to find someone accepting of my sexual needs and desires that I attribute to my gender identity, I really enjoy getting to be submissive to the women I'm with and receiving anal play from them, and there is a stigma about guys receiving anal as being gay which is unfortunately thought by a lot of people, even though for me its been a sexual act that allows me to fantasize about getting to receive penetrative sex as a woman, its the closest I have ever come to sexually feeling feminine. 

I read once something along the lines of sometimes during pregnancy the fetus is supposed to be female but can sometimes change to male at the last moment from trauma or drugs or other factors during the pregnancy, leading to it being born a male with higher then normal estrogen levels. I've always had low testosterone levels and my birth mother had drug problems so I kind of suspect that maybe might have been the case with me. I have no way to know that for certain besides the feeling that I was supposed to have been born differently. All I know is I've never felt like I was living the right life, and I wish I could have grown up as a girl, getting to feel pretty, getting asked to dances, discovering being more attracted to other women, getting to experience bearing a child. I dont really know what my point here is, just needed to say some stuff even if no one reads its.

Sometimes, I really want to go on T, and I probably will once I age, but I don’t mind looking androgynous right now.  

I just REALLY want my boobs off, sweet lordy, they freak me the fuck out. 

I think the main off putter for T is hair loss. I want to be an old bald man, but I don’t want to be an old bald man *yet*.

I sometimes hate my voice, I sometimes don’t. 

Most of the things T gives (bottom growth, facial hair, muscle) I don’t particularly care for.

And my face is already pretty neutral + guys accept me as a cis dude even though I don’t pass 100%

My main dysphoria is with my hips and my chest. I can’t really do much about my hips, but I can get chest surgery.

Over the course of my life, I've acknowledged that I definitely feel more comfortable internally identifying in feminine ways, or as a feminine persona. Hanging around men, I have to ""put on"" a more masculine personality. My friends are by and large, mostly women. I feel much more comfortable in groups of only women, in fact as a child I always found myself in friend groups that consisted mainly of girls. I've done a few gender-identifying personality tests and they always come back predominantly female.

Lately I've been growing my hair out really long, I got ear piercings, sometimes I'll wear eyeliner or something. I like form fitting clothes, unisex stuff, cutesy t-shirts, etc. People can somewhat tell I'm not some hetero cis-male.

The thing is, I'm totally okay with knowing that who I am inside isn't quite aligned with who I am outside. It might help that others find me quite attractive (going off what I'm told). But (and this gets into some of my spiritual beliefs) I honestly think when it comes down to it that even if my soul is female, I'm happy with the male body that it's in.

2018-01-25 15:29:49,7swtda,0,4,"Today I had an appointment at a ""new therapist"" after I had a - not so good - situation at the one I've visited before. Total waste of time.. 

In advance I told them why I wanted to come and they told me that they have not much experience but they see no problem in working with me and we'll be fine. 

So I had to go there today just that they can tell me that they don't work with trans people because they have no idea of the topic and they even don't wont to work on that kind of setting...

Did I just wasted nearly two months I could have spent looking for someone suitable because they told me on the phone everything would be fine? :(

With the baseline of me beeing still very confused and not sure if transition is for me, but also with the sometimes spiking urge and feeling of why the hell am I not into the process yet - I want to live within a female body desperately and at the same time fear of making anything worse for me I just feel tired at the moment...

With all the other things I have to take care of at the moment I really have no idea what is keeping me going.

I sometimes think I should just keep not thinking about anything as good as I can and drown myself in work, games and fast food.

Sorry for this, but I have to share this with someone.

1) How do you decide that you're the opposite gender? Is it just something you feel or is there more to it? 

2) How do you feel about people who don't want to date you because you're transgender? In your opinion is it wrong for them to change their minds once they find out? In my opinion, only bi people would be fine with dating a transgender.

3) Friend told me transgender people seek validation from others, well, it's your body so you can do whatever you want, I have to problems with that, I just find it hard to understand why? What are your thoughts on that?

now for what’s bothering me. i don’t understand why i’m so unhappy all the time. i have short hair, a small chest (cup size a), boyish clothes, a boyfriend who loves me and calls me “he” and defends me in transphobic conversations about me, friends and teachers who call me “he”, my preferred name, and therapy (not for gender though). i don’t understand what i’m doing to feel so awful and sad/angry most of the time. for instance, i have a friend (i’ll call him N) who’s trans and has a very accepting family. whenever i see him, i get super angry and have really violent thoughts about hurting him or myself. i have no idea what’s going on or if i’m just going crazy but i just needed to say something about it. however, i have the same feelings that i have towards N for other people that have transitioned successfully in school. they’re taken seriously by the people they love most and are accepted fully. they actually look good and pass.
