2018-11-01 13:35:36,9t9gns,4,1,"Hello, my name is Roberto, im 15 years old and this is actually my first ever post on reddit.

Idk where to start. I'd like to know if im trans, or just weird. Im very confused and nervous at the moment, about sex, about transness (?) myself and my sexuality all that good stuff. 

I was born as a guy and I've never felt unsatisfied with myself or my body. Im sorry if this offends trans people because i feel like I'd like to be trans for the wrong reasons. This might be kind of straight forward, anyway here goes:

About a year ago i experimented a bit with masturbation and i had a kind of phase where i inserted dildo-like objects in my butt because i was kind of longing/drawn towards the feeling of being penetrated. I did this for a few months and then it passed because it wasnt worth the preparation (the whole shave your ass, wash it inside out, wash the toys, it was very time consuming). At that point i kind of started to question my straightness and my first thought was that i might be gay, but i wasnt attracted to guys so i was kinda confused. Anyway that phase passed and i accepted im just straight with a mild penetration fetish. I kept that mentality until a few days ago, when my gf and i were talking about her being slightly confused about her sexuality (in case you're interested she might be bi or lesbian we haven't figured it out yet but i support her wherever she finds comfort) and we moved on to mine. I told her I'd like to have the pleasures a girl has for example multiple orgasms or being turned on and getting wet or just one female orgasm, because apparently girls experience orgasms differently from guys. Guys have a very short intense experience, whereas girls (from what I've read) have longer, smoother and more emotional orgasms. I really like the idea of that. Even during sex i feel like i would feel better if i had female genitalia instead of male. Don't get me wrong i love sex and finishing i just feel like I'd be more satisfied if i were the one being penetrated.

I've done some research about being trans and i kind of relate but not totally. This is what has me so confused about my sexuality. I dont (think) i feel body dysmorphia, i like my body and my face. I look slightly more feminine than an average guy so i guess that might weigh into it. What I do kind of feel is a slight dissatisfaction about my penis. I feel like had it been a vagina, i would be more satisfied sexually. But then i think ""wouldnt it be weird if i had a vagina but no breasts and no feminine hormones?"" so im considering it all, and it makes me nervous and scared. I suppose i coukd start taking hormones but even thats a n enormous step. Im in the middle of puberty so i dont know if this feeling of insecurity and dissatisfaction comes from fucked up hormones and a brain going through development, or if im actually trans, to some degree. Now about the mental thing, honestly, i wouldnt mind being a girl. It sounds awesome. I also behave kind of not-so-manly so i guess it wouldn't be that big of a change to try and be a girl for a while.

I'd like to have some advice from the trans-community about the transition from HRT and how it can affect me, to dressing like a girl, haircuts, surgery, sex. Everything. Im just very confused and I'd like to hear your honest opinion about the whole thing. Thanks for reading, I look forward to your responses 💜💙💚❤️

I've always completely hated gender roles/stereotypes/norms, do whatever you want regardless of how your gender ""normally"" acts. So my issue is this: how do you support the abolishment of gender stereotypes when as a trans you sort of reinforce them?

I've looked into this question before and the best argument I've seen is that it's not about wanting to be like what you perceive the opposite gender to be, its more about literally feeling like your body is the incorrect sex; more of a physical thing than a cultural thing. This is a very solid argument, but if that's the case it brings up another issue with me: How is it different than other body dismorphia disorders? Is the trans community open to the idea of trans-racial? My experience so far is that the answer is no, trans is supported in terms of gender/sex, but not any other aspects.

I want to better understand. I'm still usually pro-trans in debates because the opposing side is usually coming from a hateful or incredibly ignorant place, instead of a cultural/scientific disagreement. I don't think trans people should be treated as poorly as they are, but I also personally (and I really don't want to offend people so I'm really sorry to hurt your feelings) see it as a mental disorder.

Homosexuality used to be in the DSM, and I can see the idea of trans being the next thing that society gets woke on and gets over treating people like they're wrong just because they're different.

Hello there! Anyone out there trans identifying or working in an organization that serves trans folks? I have some quick Qs for you that might help me work on a grant I'm am applying for to help develop awareness and and content for trans support orgs in the deep south, take as little or as much time as you like to answer--

1. What are your thoughts on the state of trans visibility?
2. How do we balance the mission of visibility with the need for safety of a vulnerable community?
3. Can strengthening our virtual community and presence be a helpful tool to connect isolated trans people, especially in the most ideologically dangerous parts of the US?

2018-11-02 08:50:30,9tiarg,12,1,"I'm doing a show as part of course, my classmates and I all wrote plays and we're working together to put them on as a collection of short pieces in about a week's time. The pieces are all pretty varied in nature and two that I am performing in are a musical fluff piece and a play about a gay man at his jewish boyfriends funeral as a sad but really sweet ending to the whole show.

 Part of the whole process for us is collaboration with the other courses in the art department such as makeup, live production (All the important tech stuff) and costume. From the first meeting with costume, one of the students decided to that she had issues with both the pieces. Lets just call her P. P's objection to the second script seemed solely based of the subject matter which was further reinforced on her dropping her complaint when she found out the author was a gay Jewish man. 

P's complaint about the musical piece was slightly more faceted. In it a teenage boy uses song and charm to make his way through a day at school. Think saved by the bell meets high school musical almost. There is a scene within this where the boy goes to the canteen to get his lunch and he misidentifies the lunchlady, apologises, serenades her and gets a plate of cookies for charming her.

B. Excuse me sir this cupcake is saggy
L: I ain't no sir, I'm a lady. 
B:I'm so sorry ms… moose, I feel like such a goose, really more of a duck, but do you really give a-
Now I didn't actually say this, what I said was actually a lot more charming and went something like this 
🎵I apologise, dear mademoiselle moose, 
I didn't know you were a female,
It's my fault, it's all my fault
You're beautiful 🎵

This was and by extension, the director (not the writer) was deemed transphobic by P and in response the director said he would speak to the artistic director and pass on the message but that he doubted anything would come of it. In her telling of the story she was told a blatant no at this point but that's just untrue. From this point on the timeline it gets a little hazy because rather than going through the proper channels to complain P would end discussions seemingly on a note of appeasement only to come back having escalated the situation. That being said I do know that these things occurred in more less this order: 

she refused to talk to my teacher, the Artistic Director (AD) with the frequently used power to make edits to the scripts or her teacher so that complaint could be handled before it was formalised. 

She emailed the course director for the arts courses a complaint which never made it to him. Whether this was a fault on her part or his was never made clear but it did seem that it was a failure on her part to send it properly.

AND THIS IS THE BIG ONE
she took a photo of his script which she obtained for use in costume design and shared it with at least 20 of her friends outside of the school on a Facebook story and urged them to complain to my school with a complaints url she attached. 10 of this were returned and have to be individually responded to 

She contacted Transgender Victoria and had them send a rep to assess the scene. 

All of this happened before P had even seen the piece by the way, she had only read an outdated version of the script, the lunchlady character was also never trans but just androgynous.

A week out from the show and during the tech runs that were already running hours over time (anyone who works around a stage knows the stress that those runs can entail) the rep from Trans Vic came into the theatre and watched the scene and afterwards myself, the director, the writer of the piece, a trans man and a non binary individual within the class who both had watched the scene hundreds of times and agreed the trope was old hat but it was never offensive went into the foyer with the course director, the AD ,P and the Trans Vic reps. Immediately into sitting down P asks it to be a private meeting. The AD tries to make her understand that as the writer, director, performer of the role and relevant “offended parties” we really should be there but relents and sends the students out of the room. 
Not only were we not allowed to speak in defence of the piece but we didn't even get to hear their complaints. 

We came back in the room as they were leaving to the conclusion that all the dialogue for the lunchlady (my character) whom we have spent months workshopping and building is cut, and that a whole new costume needs to be made for the character that's “less female”

So now we're a week from the show, there's a new load of work to do with changing the script, learning it, changing sound and lighting cues and making another costume. 
I'm a cisgendered male performer so I'm not the authority on what people should be offended by but jokes in poor taste aside the way this was handled has left a lot of people rather pissed off. Sharing his script on a social platform and calling her friends to brigade it to us feels like a possible instance of defamation and an almost certain copyright infringement in her abuse of his intellectual property. We have a lot more work ahead of us now and had she handled it through the proper channels it could've been long resolved but instead by making it about her and being the signal of virtue it's put us all through the ringer

But I didn't write this to read what I have to say so I wanted share it here. Alll through the process people kept talking about being offensive and what constituted that but during the discussion a trans person didn't even get to have their say on what they thought and P was speaking on the behalf of a community they weren't a part of

He wanted to talk to me away from the rest because he barely ever gets to talk to me (for context this is the first time all those friends have seen me in ages too- I've been barely able to afford to feed myself much less go to parties, I have reasons for being distant from my friends) and he took issue with me apparently not listening to other people's experiences enough and just talking about my experience.

He then talked about maybe being an 'advocate or spokesperson for trans issues' and it was unclear to me if he was trying to say that I should consider things other than transitioning? He also kept on saying it's good I came out and talked about communication issues with other friends. 

I'm not sure. I don't know if I'm being paranoid, I am prone to it- truth be told my mental state hasn't been good, and my critical thinking skills have been affected as much as I hate to admit. So help me out- should I be wary? Is he low-key a bit phobic or am I reading too much into things?

2018-11-02 23:43:47,9tpejq,0,1,"This is just me, someone who recently figured out that she is trans venting about events of slightly over a year ago. I’m sorry if this isn’t allowed since this is my first post here, but I just need to get this off my chest. Also, it’s late where I live, so i might reply late to comments.

My ex was a horrible person doing a great job of hiding it. He was a puppy, needed all of my attention and barely thought for himself. He was a bigot with a disdain for women and trans people. I thought we could fix that, he hid it from me instead. He was emotionally manipulative by making small things seem huge, thus making huge things seem small. He, on one occasion, exchanged dick pics with a stranger through Grindr (we were supposed to be monogamous) and gaslighted me into consoling him. He wouldn’t tell me what happened, came to my place and forced me to get it out of him. Then he drowned himself in self-pity. i had to help him get himself back together. I’m still processing that to this day, because I was robbed of the opportunity at the time. This was not the end of us though. I simply persevered like my friends advised me to. Until one day I decided to do something different: cross dressing (I was very much an egg). It felt great to look, even if unconvincingly, like a woman, but he didn’t think it was great. Long story short: he locked himself in his room until I was “me” again (as if I wasn’t me). When he finally seemed ready to discuss the whole debacle I had been “a thing out of his worst nightmares”. Something snapped and I nearly ended our relationship there. I was dumb though and I didn’t. Over time I lost my feelings for him, that former love had become dulled. I discussed this with him and we decided to take a break. I broke up with him nearly a year ago. Afterwards he quickly reverted to his bigoted self, aided by a group of horrible friends.

When I say horrible friends I want to add that this concerns a small in-group within a larger cluster of people. Those uninvolved likely didn’t know much of anything. These people, who would casually use the nazi salute (including the chant) to greet each other (I’m guilty of initially going along with it, not gonna lie), allowed my ex to be as much of a shit as he wanted. I was gaslighted into becoming friends with him again way before I was even ready to decide whether or not I wanted that. I fell for it. Until the midway point of summer we were “friends”. The group, in the period before the breakup and until at least last summer, planned a lot of activities. A constantly decreasing amount of which I was invited to. Excuses would always be made: “we planned it spontaneously” or “you live too far away” (an hour at most) amongst others. Even when a car was involved I was never asked along. The first few times I believed it, after the fourth I knew what was going on. This all came to its conclusion on my ex’s birthday. He was being transphobic (the attack helicopter thing), as per usual, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I gave him a small kick against his leg and told him to leave me alone. The group was angry at my use of violence (which I admit I probably shouldn’t have) and condoned his behaviour. I picked up my final things from his place two days later only to receive a final slap in the face. The group had banded together to buy my ex the newest iPad and I hadn’t been involved at all. I finished my final obligations to them (a funeral service of sorts) and left them.

In hindsight I’m happy I left him and that group behind, because I would have never realised my transness if I had stayed.

I’m sharing this with my non-existent followers because I need to vent about how I’ve been treated by people who claimed to be my friends, yet clearly weren’t. I gave them more than two months to try and contact me, to see if they perhaps did care, but that was futile.

I am supportive of his choice I just don't know if I should try and convince him not to go through with it or if I should push him towards his goal, Im always there for him in whatever he needs but we are quite young and to my understanding this os a 1 time decision there's no going back...

I have 2 major concerns about this and many smaller so if you read through all of what I will type in an effort to help me then you have my gratitude!

Well my first major concern lies with how long he's admitting to feeling he wants to change, he said he's been contemplating it for 2 years, on and off talking and a little research here and there, but I feel he's not thought long enough and hard enough for this life changing decision, on top of that, I fear he hasn't looked at the bad side of the change, as in what can go wrong how a huge majority mistreat trans people... That's where my second major concern comes in, he is not very mentally strong, he is very easily upset and anger etc. (we believe he suffers with a hyper sensitive personality disorder, though he needs to seek a professional to know for sure) and I seriously fear that of something went wrong through the procedure, or the negative backlash from people would possibly drive him to suicide hotlines and maybe even to suicide...

Other concerns I have include people mistreating him where I cannot help if he goes through, because if he does then our relationship will end, and like that I cannot help him in private situations...

I also worry that I heard trans people are more susceptible to STD's something that may play heavy on him...

Another concern I have is money... I am not aware of how much a full transition costs, but I would assume it is certainly not on the cheap side of things...

Around age 3 “Paloma” not the real name) began asking when she would grow a penis like her older brothers. I assumed this was just because she looked up to them so much.  She dressed like them, she was even tougher and more adventurous than them in some ways.
Parents of a MTF child told me to “get ready” as this was how their child presented. Others said “she just idolizes her brothers”.

At age 5 we moved she made a new friend (also age 5) who had recently socially transitioned FTM with a new name. She only knew her new friend had a vulva because he showed her once. So we had an age-appropriate discussion about it.

Then Paloma (who had been dressing in boys clothes for about a year) began to say things like:
“When I get older I won’t have boobs like yours.”
“What will you have?”
“Something else”

Right before he turned 6 I asked him when people say “him” did he want me to continue correcting them. His answer: No. So we stopped.

A few weeks later he asked to be called Diego. For the last 5 months he has been a boy, Diego, and enjoying it. Everyone has adjusted very well to it.

Not long after this he angrily asked me:
“Why didn’t you know I was Diego when I was born?”

I apologized. What else could I do? I didn’t know he was a boy.

3 months ago we cut off all his hair. My husband has been supportive of everything else but this was one thing he was loathe to let go of. I finally just took him to get it cut. Diego was super happy with it.

We sifted through his nicer clothes today and he opted to: keep the clip on tie my mom bought him for the last wedding we attended (he ended up not wearing it but was in “boy” clothes otherwise) and even asked to keep the few dresses he still has “in case we go to a wedding”.

The only time he chose to wear a dress was on my bday a month ago. He said that when he wears a dress like if we go eat out, to call him Paloma, but otherwise it’s Diego.

I know it’s probably easier for trans guys to transition than trans women, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. It doesn’t help that I’m short, either. If I stay a girl, which I could do without being too uncomfortable, then I’d be seen as attractive or cute by others; I always have been.

1. If a person doesn't have dysphoria then can they be trans?

2. Is dysphoria actually classified as a mental illness.

3. What are y'alls opinions on the terms 'trans-tenders?'

4.What are your thoughts on the type of person who seems exaggerated. I mean the people you see on YouTube in cringe compilations.

5. What are y'alls thoughts on people making up genders.

2018-11-05 12:21:06,9ud1m5,2,1,"Currently, I'm 22 and was born male. Back when I was 17 I started to get feelings like I wasn't a boy and wanted to be a girl, months of research and tumblr browsing (this was 2013 after all) I felt like I was confident enough to confirm to myself and a few close friends that I was trans. One thing is that my body is pretty masculine, and a defining feature of myself was a big beard, even at this age, though I often kept my hair long.

Suddenly, I end up in an LDR with one of the friends I opened up to. She and I have an okay start to our relationship but it quickly becomes toxic and manipulative, which lead to her cheating and it ending about a year later. But during this relationship, about a few months in I stopped feeling the same feelings I used to have. I figured at the time that thinking I was trans was just a phase and moved on with my life.

After my last relationship, I ended up in another relationship, which lasted 3 years and I could copy paste the last paragraph and it'd be just as accurate to describe this one as well for the purposes of this story. But nearing the end, I was feeling slight twinges of my old feelings when I'd see really cute girls doing cosplay. This surprised me since I thought that these were feelings long since buried.

Cut now to about ~3 months out of that last relationship, and all of my old feelings have come back in full. Now that I'm thinking of myself and no longer wanting to simply please someone by presenting myself in the way they want me to.

It's not been as simple as flicking a switch and I now know I'm trans, there's so many things going on in my head. As I explained it to my trans friend, I don't feel like I'm 100% one or the other, but my feminine side doesn't feel comfortable in a masculine body, but my masculine side is obviously fine with it. I believe this is why I don't experience dysphoria that much since my front facing side is masculine, but I feel this need and want to be female.

Back when I was 17 I started to get feelings like I wasn't a boy and wanted to be a girl, months of research and tumblr browsing (this was 2013 after all) I felt like I was confident enough to confirm to myself and a few close friends that I was trans. One thing is that my body is pretty masculine, and a defining feature of myself was a big beard, even at this age, though I often kept my hair long.\n\nSuddenly, I end up in an LDR with one of the friends I opened up to. She and I have an okay start to our relationship but it quickly becomes toxic and manipulative, which lead to her cheating and it ending about a year later. But during this relationship, about a few months in I stopped feeling the same feelings I used to have. I figured at the time that thinking I was trans was just a phase and moved on with my life.\n\nAfter my last relationship, I ended up in another relationship, which lasted 3 years and I could copy paste the last paragraph and it'd be just as accurate to describe this one as well for the purposes of this story. But nearing the end, I was feeling slight twinges of my old feelings when I'd see really cute girls doing cosplay. This surprised me since I thought that these were feelings long since buried.\n\nCut now to about ~3 months out of that last relationship, and all of my old feelings have come back in full. Now that I'm thinking of myself and no longer wanting to simply please someone by presenting myself in the way they want me to.\n\nIt's not been as simple as flicking a switch and I now know I'm trans, there's so many things going on in my head. As I explained it to my trans friend, I don't feel like I'm 100% one or the other, but my feminine side doesn't feel comfortable in a masculine body, but my masculine side is obviously fine with it. I believe this is why I don't experience dysphoria that much since my front facing side is masculine, but I feel this need and want to be female.

So I recently came across an article on /r/metacanada, which is a hate subreddit. It has the following title: ""Science finds 1,500 genetic differences between boys and girls, destroys ‘transgender’ arguments"" ([link here](https://np.reddit.com/r/metacanada/comments/9sra5h/science_finds_1500_genetic_differences_between/e8rqqy6/)). [Here's all the times this article has been reposted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/duplicates/9sra5h/science_finds_1500_genetic_differences_between/) A google search for the title of the article shows that various blogs have been linking it for this reason for almost a year. 

This is amusing, because the actual title of the article is ""The landscape of sex-differential transcriptome and its consequent selection in human adults"". 

The key word here is ""transcriptome"". That means RNA, not DNA. **Why is this an important distinction?** Because the transcriptome is variable. It changes to suit the needs of an organism - changes in the transcriptome can result in variations in gene expression. In other words, the impact of a particular gene is regulated in part by RNA. 

There's more detail in the paper's Background section: 

&gt; In all cases, **males and females have identical genetic information across most of their genomes, but harbor many distinct sex-specific characteristics. For example, mammalian offspring depend on maternal lactation in their early life.** ... However, genes involved in lactation are also carried by males, who do not express this trait [2]. ... It is thus expected that the vast majority of sexually dimorphic traits are due to differential expression of genes that are present in both sexes [21]. 

If literally anyone in that thread had browsed through the article, they could have had a bigger number than 1,500, too: ""... there are over 6,500 protein-coding genes with significant SDE (sex differential expression) in at least one tissue."" Although, an observant reader might notice that the next line is: ""The most sex-differentiated tissue, with 6123 SDE (sex differentially expressed) protein-coding genes, is the breast mammary glands..."" to no one's surprise. 

So, we've learned:
1. Women grow boobs.
2. This is responsible for about 94% of the sex-differentiation in the transcriptome (by number of genes).
3.

I was overwhelmed by everything that is happening in my life.

I feel twisted up inside by everything, every time I go in public I see strangers and I always try to imagine their entire lives and see them as people with as much intricacy as everyone I have known all my life, I see them from too many points of view sometimes and start to collapse within myself.

I don’t even know who I am.

I’ve started to feel dysphoric about my body and appearance recently, and I am too aware of the way other people perceive me. When I am around other people it’s like I shatter into their perspectives of the situation.
Crowds make me break up too fine.

I feel like a terrible person. I try to be totally ethical and never hurt anyone but I always hurt others.

I worried about transitioning. Whether I will ever be woman enough.

I am too much and I magnify things of minor proportions till they take up all I can see, and feel all the problems in the world and how I am doing nothing to help anything. 

You are all my heart, and I care about you all to my core.

I procrastinate too much, and I have let you and myself down my whole life.

I had my lgbt group meet-up last night and I felt like I needed to go.
I felt overwhelmed there too but for different reasons and in different ways.

I want to spend time with you all, but I don’t maintain relationships. They all seem to crumble.

I’m afraid of what you will think of me. How you will react and how I will have to react to your reacting, while keeping everything perfect and harmonious and always failing.

I want to put life down for a minute and have a break. Take a rest from myself and everything.

2018-11-09 00:14:39,9vfj38,8,1,"Hey all, finding myself in a weird place. To give a little back story, I’ve been making some cascading life changes for the past few years, and I’ve been doing a bit of healing. I keep finding myself in new(er) places in my mind and life. 

Growing up, I remember really liking female characters in movies and cartoons, especially if they were the hero and / or pretty. Being a man (boy then), I would envision I was their male counterpart.

I never fit in with most men/boys. I was usually picked on in groups of boys. I was / am pretty athletic. I am also pretty shy, though I do get nervous and ramble in group settings. For whatever reason, it’s as if I was always the outcast, though due to athleticism and intelligence, I was ‘accepted’ into the group due to being useful I guess (trying to not sound conceited but explain why groups of my own gender seemed to accept me).

On the contrary, as young as 5th or 6th grade, I had very many friends of the opposite sex. I was the first boy who sat with an all girl table during lunch (if you can recall those days). I preferred the conversation. Girls would explain things to me - friendships / relationships / boy stuff / girl stuff. I didn’t grow up in a great home. Lots of abuse and I was alone a lot. I am a proficient self learner as a result. In the neighborhood I grew up in, I would hang out with older high school aged girls. Looking back, there were definitely some “signs” I missed. Not saying that were looking to take advantage of a younger boy, but they’d invite me over when their parents weren’t home to hang out alone. I was a later bloomer when it came to puberty, so that was also a huge factor on that note. But I do feel as if I was being courted to a degree. I just thought they were really pretty and liked being around these young women and spending time with them.

In high school, my hormones raged for girls. In my twenties my bisexuality started to flourish. But in those days, my body yearned for women and their parts. I believe my early pull to having female friends at a young age helped me be successful with dating and physical relationships at that stage of life. A lot of young women at that age told me things I didn’t quite grasp - I knew how to touch them. My attention to their needs, and appreciation of their bodies and intimates made me appealing. I really enjoyed their underwear and clothes they wore. Maybe not more than other boys did, but more than a few indicated that my appreciation was different in both an arousing and fulfilling way for them. I’m not sure if that makes sense. I understand it now, but it’s hard to communicate in text.

Now I am a 30 year old man. I’ve never questioned my sexuality. When my bisexuality flourished, I did have a period of time where it was new and scary, and thus I developed avoidant behaviors. I sought therapy, and that’s when the “cascading” life changes began to happen. I became ok with liking men and women as sexual and romantic partners. I’ve now been dating both, and feeling fulfilled in relationships with both. I recently just quit a toxic job and am finally feeling some things I’ve never quite felt before in my life.

All my life I’ve never been sure of where I fit. I never developed my own “style” of appearance like some people do. I hesitate to say most, but I definitely was/am one of those people that followed trends - not because I wanted to be trendy, but because I didn’t know what I wanted so I just did what everyone else did / wore. I’ve struggled with finding things about myself or that I enjoy that I can “call my own”. Due to bottoming with men, and my enjoyment of that, I’ve learned to embrace more “feminine” things. To give an example, I was always very aroused by sexy bra and panties on my girlfriends. So once I became ok with my sexuality with men, I began to experiment with sexier cuts of underwear, but for the male anatomy. That was a huge thing for me because it gave me so much confidence in myself and I began to feel that I did something (in regards to appearance) that was “for me”. 

I’ve never really fit with men (as I stated above). And I’ve never had the type of infatuation with my penis that most men seem to have (varying degrees obviously). In fact, other than as a vehicle for pleasure for myself and my partner, I’m really ambivalent about it, truth be told. Also due to the bottoming, I’ve had the natural thoughts of - what would this feel like if I had a vagina? I feel like most people have these thoughts, so I’m not trying to be romantic. 

And then something happened to me last night. A show I’ve been watching, that I’ve honestly been sort of “meh” about as a whole, began a lesbian narrative that recaptured my attention. The scenes for the narrative were well done, and there was something about some of the sex scenes with a specific character, in the way her body was reacting (I get it’s acting but it actually was not a typical Hollywood sex scene in my humble opinion) that struck a chord in me. Then, her love interest invites her to a lesbian bar where a bunch of women were dancing. As a man, I know I’m not welcome in those spaces, even as a member of the community, but I felt very strongly that “wow - those look like my people. I wish I was there dancing with these wonderful women.”

And right there is where I went.. wait... do I want to be a woman? Have I always? Am I just confused? I started to give myself space to just exist and not over think it, and I began to realize a lot of my nervous behaviors that sometimes make others view me as odd or make them dislike me, often stemmed from me being confused as to how a boy / man should act, so inevitably I’d overcompensate. I’ve always been told by my family, coaches, professors, mentors, that I’m a leader and I need to step up and be a man. But last night made me wonder - is the reason I struggle so hard to do this because I don’t actually identify as one? I’m not trying to jump to conclusions but it was such a profound “click” in my brain that I haven’t been able to get it out. I do find women sexually and romantically attractive, but it was something about those characters. Their interactions, their clothing / appearance. The dancing. It just made something in my brain click into place. 

I’ve always tried dating trans folks and haven’t been successful. I find both sexes to be attractive. I tend to get ghosted. The last relationship I had was with a trans woman with whom I had a strong connection with, both emotionally and physically. We never did more than kiss and hand hold, but it was one of those very strong chemistry type kiss and hand holds that both parties sort of blush and acknowledge as less common, and thus more coveted. She ended up ghosting me. I found out later from a mutual acquaintance that she was in a relationship with a gay man and they were looking to become a throuple (is that the right word?) and I guess she had been trying to bring it up for some time, but kept chickening out. We spent weeks talking, and then weeks hanging out in public places (trans women experience violence from men so she was being cautious which I respected). Apparently the night in question when we were hanging out and hand holding / kissing, she asked a question along the lines of “would you ever do a three person relationship?” - I do remember this line of conversation, and I remember actually answering in my typical nonchalant overcompensating man way “no I think I’m a one woman man. Or one man man.” I felt the need as the “man” to sort of assure her. I guess I assured my way out of her life lol, but I digress. 

So my TL:DR if anyone has bothered to read this - how did you know? I’m definitely not making an appointment at a clinic for hormones. I’m definitely not ruling it out for the future, either. I’ve just never felt like being a man suited me. I guess I never considered that inside I might identify as a woman. It makes sense that I would, given everything I’ve tried to explain.

Thanks!",trans,When and how did you know?,1541747679.0,"{'created_utc': 1541722479, 'id': '9vfj38', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey all, finding myself in a weird place. To give a little back story, I’ve been making some cascading life changes for the past few years, and I’ve been doing a bit of healing. I keep finding myself in new(er) places in my mind and life. \n\nGrowing up, I remember really liking female characters in movies and cartoons, especially if they were the hero and / or pretty. Being a man (boy then), I would envision I was their male counterpart.\n\nI never fit in with most men/boys. I was usually picked on in groups of boys. I was / am pretty athletic. I am also pretty shy, though I do get nervous and ramble in group settings. For whatever reason, it’s as if I was always the outcast, though due to athleticism and intelligence, I was ‘accepted’ into the group due to being useful I guess (trying to not sound conceited but explain why groups of my own gender seemed to accept me).\n\nOn the contrary, as young as 5th or 6th grade, I had very many friends of the opposite sex. I was the first boy who sat with an all girl table during lunch (if you can recall those days). I preferred the conversation. Girls would explain things to me - friendships / relationships / boy stuff / girl stuff. I didn’t grow up in a great home. Lots of abuse and I was alone a lot. I am a proficient self learner as a result. In the neighborhood I grew up in, I would hang out with older high school aged girls. Looking back, there were definitely some “signs” I missed. Not saying that were looking to take advantage of a younger boy, but they’d invite me over when their parents weren’t home to hang out alone. I was a later bloomer when it came to puberty, so that was also a huge factor on that note. But I do feel as if I was being courted to a degree. I just thought they were really pretty and liked being around these young women and spending time with them.\n\nIn high school, my hormones raged for girls. In my twenties my bisexuality started to flourish. But in those days, my body yearned for women and their parts. I believe my early pull to having female friends at a young age helped me be successful with dating and physical relationships at that stage of life. A lot of young women at that age told me things I didn’t quite grasp - I knew how to touch them. My attention to their needs, and appreciation of their bodies and intimates made me appealing. I really enjoyed their underwear and clothes they wore. Maybe not more than other boys did, but more than a few indicated that my appreciation was different in both an arousing and fulfilling way for them. I’m not sure if that makes sense. I understand it now, but it’s hard to communicate in text.\n\nNow I am a 30 year old man. I’ve never questioned my sexuality. When my bisexuality flourished, I did have a period of time where it was new and scary, and thus I developed avoidant behaviors. I sought therapy, and that’s when the “cascading” life changes began to happen. I became ok with liking men and women as sexual and romantic partners. I’ve now been dating both, and feeling fulfilled in relationships with both. I recently just quit a toxic job and am finally feeling some things I’ve never quite felt before in my life.\n\nAll my life I’ve never been sure of where I fit. I never developed my own “style” of appearance like some people do. I hesitate to say most, but I definitely was/am one of those people that followed trends - not because I wanted to be trendy, but because I didn’t know what I wanted so I just did what everyone else did / wore. I’ve struggled with finding things about myself or that I enjoy that I can “call my own”. Due to bottoming with men, and my enjoyment of that, I’ve learned to embrace more “feminine” things. To give an example, I was always very aroused by sexy bra and panties on my girlfriends. So once I became ok with my sexuality with men, I began to experiment with sexier cuts of underwear, but for the male anatomy. That was a huge thing for me because it gave me so much confidence in myself and I began to feel that I did something (in regards to appearance) that was “for me”. \n\nI’ve never really fit with men (as I stated above). And I’ve never had the type of infatuation with my penis that most men seem to have (varying degrees obviously). In fact, other than as a vehicle for pleasure for myself and my partner, I’m really ambivalent about it, truth be told. Also due to the bottoming, I’ve had the natural thoughts of - what would this feel like if I had a vagina? I feel like most people have these thoughts, so I’m not trying to be romantic. \n\nAnd then something happened to me last night. A show I’ve been watching, that I’ve honestly been sort of “meh” about as a whole, began a lesbian narrative that recaptured my attention. The scenes for the narrative were well done, and there was something about some of the sex scenes with a specific character, in the way her body was reacting (I get it’s acting but it actually was not a typical Hollywood sex scene in my humble opinion) that struck a chord in me. Then, her love interest invites her to a lesbian bar where a bunch of women were dancing. As a man, I know I’m not welcome in those spaces, even as a member of the community, but I felt very strongly that “wow - those look like my people. I wish I was there dancing with these wonderful women.”\n\nAnd right there is where I went.. wait... do I want to be a woman? Have I always? Am I just confused? I started to give myself space to just exist and not over think it, and I began to realize a lot of my nervous behaviors that sometimes make others view me as odd or make them dislike me, often stemmed from me being confused as to how a boy / man should act, so inevitably I’d overcompensate. I’ve always been told by my family, coaches, professors, mentors, that I’m a leader and I need to step up and be a man. But last night made me wonder - is the reason I struggle so hard to do this because I don’t actually identify as one? I’m not trying to jump to conclusions but it was such a profound “click” in my brain that I haven’t been able to get it out. I do find women sexually and romantically attractive, but it was something about those characters. Their interactions, their clothing / appearance. The dancing. It just made something in my brain click into place. \n\nI’ve always tried dating trans folks and haven’t been successful. I find both sexes to be attractive. I tend to get ghosted. The last relationship I had was with a trans woman with whom I had a strong connection with, both emotionally and physically. We never did more than kiss and hand hold, but it was one of those very strong chemistry type kiss and hand holds that both parties sort of blush and acknowledge as less common, and thus more coveted. She ended up ghosting me. I found out later from a mutual acquaintance that she was in a relationship with a gay man and they were looking to become a throuple (is that the right word?) and I guess she had been trying to bring it up for some time, but kept chickening out. We spent weeks talking, and then weeks hanging out in public places (trans women experience violence from men so she was being cautious which I respected). Apparently the night in question when we were hanging out and hand holding / kissing, she asked a question along the lines of “would you ever do a three person relationship?” - I do remember this line of conversation, and I remember actually answering in my typical nonchalant overcompensating man way “no I think I’m a one woman man. Or one man man.” I felt the need as the “man” to sort of assure her. I guess I assured my way out of her life lol, but I digress. \n\nSo my TL:DR if anyone has bothered to read this - how did you know? I’m definitely not making an appointment at a clinic for hormones. I’m definitely not ruling it out for the future, either. I’ve just never felt like being a man suited me. I guess I never considered that inside I might identify as a woman. It makes sense that I would, given everything I’ve tried to explain. But what I’ve always felt and acknowledged is that part of why I struggle is I don’t know what type of man I want to be. I’ve always tried to dream up and act upon versions of the type of man I think I want to be, but it never felt right so I’d sort of just fade out from whatever it was I was trying to accomplish. Has anyone ever felt like this? I did spend time looking at dresses and outfits today and was really aroused and interested in exploring that. That was also a first for me.

2018-11-11 15:38:40,9w4on9,0,1,"Obs! I base this message of personal experiences and from what I have read in other articles.

&amp;#x200B;

It is interesting to see how transmen are not nearly portrayed in as a negative light as

transwomen. For one thing transwomen get a lot more publicity and are looked down on, and seen

as traps and fake. Yet there is a pretty even distribution of MTFs and FTMs.

&amp;#x200B;

Just because someone grows up as a specific gender biologically they are placed in circumstances

where they have to learn to be a certain way to be included and practically brainwashed. Based of

or physical appearances we are divided and taught to make these divisions clearer by being each

others opposites gender wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many transpersons live after these expectations as it is so hardly imprinted in most people's

minds that things are black and white. There are a lot of intersex conditions, and also transpeople

have been shown in studies to have underlying biological explanations, and even then there is

the emotional and energetic level humans not yet understand well through science at least.

&amp;#x200B;

A person born male but feeling the opposite will probably suppress their inner self because

they have grown up with expectation of being what they look like and we live in a society where

feelings matter less than facts. So this transwoman will have dysphoria usually but be confused about

what is up or/and try to suppress this. Both because of fear of being looked down on, rejection and

being an outcast. Their families will have a hard time seeing what has not been there physically

or visibly, and in many cases explain it away as something that is not real.

&amp;#x200B;

People who are not transgender, will not always understand that this is real and have only recently

been seeing transpeople portrayed in a negative light in movies or through media lately.

Thus thinking all these ""new"" trans people are fake and only coming to light because it is in the

media a lot more. However, the truth is, this is a movement where people will start to reveal

their true selves when they see others doing it and feel more empowered and comfortable as it is more

public. It is not a result of just jumping on an interesting new trend.

&amp;#x200B;

People who are not transgender will just see this new publicity and new found concepts in media and

think that it is just something weird people want to try out or similar(that is my understanding of

some people). They did not know about this before and think it just recently came into being.

But it has always been there. People are not used to this and to them it seems surreal, awkward, strange,

weird and they might be uncomfortable or feel like something is being taken from their gender.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are a cisperson(feeling like the gender you were born), then imagine for a second that you were

born in the opposite gender or somewhere in-between. Imagine that you somehow have a constant nagging

gut-feeling that something is wrong. It is the fact that you are not what you seem like. It is

like suddenly waking up in another life and another gender, with new memories but a sense, a feeling that

you are supposed to be something else. This is what it is about.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a transperson is not a decision, and not necessarily something you want. It is something that

just IS. Just like many people just are comfortable with the gender they are born with. It just is

a state of being.

&amp;#x200B;

With all disease existing and so on in a modern world of chemicals being used without long-term

effects in mind we can't possibly know what these things used in products, food and the air will have

as an affect on us. Maybe transpeople are partially a result of something similar. Just as some

people are born with ADHD, without and arm or impaired in someway.

&amp;#x200B;

People in general are not yet used to seeing people in-between genders and feel like there is an

invasion on their territory or afraid that they will end up with someone not being what they seem

like. We just need to get more used to things we didn't previously think existed, but actually did.

It is like the idea of using a phone today talking out into thin air would be ridiculous maybe 50 - 100

years ago. The idea of the technologic advances made today would be ridiculous 20 year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

We are adaptable beings who get used to things. Eventually things will be facts and not about

holding on to a stubborn belief.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't imagine how weird it is for you because someone close to you is ""weird"" for thinking they are

transgender and it previously seemed inconceivable. Instead imagine how hard it must be for that

person having lived a lie and try to convince or be comfortable amongst people who see this

as something opposite as normal. I thank everyone in the transcommunity for staying strong and all

loving humans who accept and love one another no matter etnicity, gender, preferences etc..

&amp;#x200B;

This is just me letting my thoughts out. I have not revised it and hope nothing is formulated in a wrong

way. I will correct anything that may be wrong.

2018-11-12 18:54:07,9wgtnl,6,1,"I started hrt 8 months ago. I didn't live with my parents when I started it, but I do now. I'm not out to anyone in my family. My tits are becoming very noticeable. I can't wear a bra because it's very very noticeable through my shirts. My voice has become very girly (multiple ppl that I'm not out to have told me that). My face has changed so much according to my sister. She also called me ""she"" the other day and quickly (un)corrected herself after. I notice my family looks at me more when I'm talking to them and their facial expressions seem to be surprised and their eyes seem to be looking at my fat redistribution (hips mostly) and boobs.

I guess my main questions are if anyone has had experience and knows if Molina actually covers transition related things (like hrt) and how hard it is to get them to cover it? And how one even gets a prescription for hormones like what kind of doctor do you go to???

Hello, everyone!

I have never posted here or even on Reddit before so please let me know if my etiquette is off! Also, let me know if any of the terms I used are offensive or outdated as I am super new!

Within the past few months, I have started to think that there is a good possibility I am trans, and I just wanted to reach out to the community to learn from people who have gone through the struggle first hand. 

My experiences so far have been fast, and seemingly out of nowhere. I was talking to my significant other about some experiences in my youth I thought were just normal guy things. When I was young, like 7-15 I would dress up as a girl whenever I was left home alone at school. Along with painting my nails and that kind of thing. I, of course, hid it, because my father is fairly, well Conservative. I was raised to be a real man's man but never really lived up to that because my interest was always in music and writing, along with science and just hanging out with my girlfriends. 

Anyway, after some discussion, we both realized that dressing up as a girl was kind of only the tip of the iceberg, as I recalled planning when I was younger to go out and get breast implants and just simply hide them forever (this was clearly asinine due to being like 10).  

My significant other btw came out to me as essentially transmasculine when we had been dating a while, because he felt as if he was in the wrong body and had done tons of research. So when I brought up the whole I wish I was feminine thing, he had seen this kind of stuff before and started to ask questions and didn’t jump to any conclusions, in fact, any conclusions I have come to at this point have been my own. 

I decided to do some research and have done some thinking and have realized that I may just be trans. I am very indifferent to how I look and behave as a male, and have always enjoyed speech patterns of females and just in general how expressive they are. I honestly have emulated that in my own life unknowingly and have been alienated from most male crowds unless I turn on hyper-masculinity which I don’t really enjoy doing as it’s a chore. I honestly just dress comfortable and have never really had any passion about looks until I tried cross-dressing like a month ago. Now I have found it relieving and I look forward to it almost every day. 

I do have some questions for anyone willing to answer, is it normal for such a sudden realization? Also, I personally have never cared how people have viewed me, as in, people calling me male pronouns just doesn’t bother me. I would rather go by female pronouns in personal life, but in everyday life, I just could not possibly care less. Is that normal or non-dysphoric?

I really appreciate any of those willing to answer some questions, and I would love to get to know the trans community better. This is all so new and honestly scary but exciting to at least confront these old issues. 

Tl;dr

I have suspicions I may be trans, because I have always wanted to behave feminine but due to my upbringing cant. I wonder if its normal for these feelings to pop up so suddenly, and is it irregular to not care about pronouns except with close loved ones? Also, I would love to get to know the community!

I'm really hoping I can find a service that specializes in this to do it better than I could.\n\nAny advice? :("", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'internet scrubbing services?', 'created': 1542343664.0}"

I know it’s a vague question but I don’t know the route I should take. 
Currently, I’m closet and only own a few woman’s clothes. I’m tempted to order some more clothing for myself, but I’m not sure I want to spend that money right now. My college (MSU) provides housing assistance to trans students, and my current roommate is more conservative. My family doesn’t know, but I think they’ll be supportive, but it’s still awkward.

The clothes I got today got rid off a lot of doubt on my gender identity, so I really think I’m doing this.

Any advice on how to approach this? Im just starting this out and I don’t know everything yet.

Fast forward to about 15min ago, long story short, my mom told me to stop referring to Caitlyn Jenner as “she” cuz she’s a “he”. While I’m not surprised my mom is transphobic, it’s definitely annoying and upsetting. 

I don’t live with my mom, thankfully, but I do rely on other family for a place to live. I doubt they’re any better on this subject. My family expects me to work for my uncle because “I have to make money like him” or else I’ll be “poor”.

So if I come out as NB, not only will that most likely alienate me from pretty much my entire family, meaning I will most likely never work for my uncle, they’ll prob say something along the lines of if only I stopped playing games and acted like a man, etc., that I would be making a lot of money and be well off. And I’m serious about that last part. They will somehow make it my fault. I can just tell.

I’m lucky to have support from my gf. She’s so amazing and so wonderful. Idk how id be dealing with this if I were on my own. Also, luckily I have a cousin who’s part of the LGBT community (and she comes from a super catholic family) who I’ve been close with our entire lives.

Before I knew I was part of the lgbt community, I never was able to fathom why it was so difficult to say you were part of it. Perhaps that’s just cuz I never saw the lgbt as anything but my equal.

But recently, she had discovered I was trans/FtM and Pan. She took me out of dance, forced me to start eating meat again, threw away nearly all my books and grilled me about my friends, trying to get me to say whether or not they were LGBT so she could tell their mothers. (I lied my ass off, btw.) 

This isn’t the first time I’ve dealt with this kinda shit before with her. My amazing older brother happens to be gay.

She berated me the whole way home and I had the first panic attack that I could clearly remember. 

These past few years, she falsely accused my dad of sexual assault towards me and my siblings. This never happened, obviously. My brother tried defending my father and she slapped him. She manipulated my little sister into hating him and she told him she never wanted to see him again. He literally started sobbing where my mother would have slapped and punished her.

I’m shaking and sobbing right now thinking about this. I feel like I’m gonna puke. I know that’s TMI but I need help. I’m gonna move in with my dad but it’ll take awhile he says. While he doesn’t know I’m trans, he knows I’m LGBT and supports it.

Hello,

	We are two transgender girls who just moved from a far away state on a simple promise, that if we got here we would have until January 1st to find a job and get back on our feet. Well, not even a month after we've arrived we're getting thrown to the curb in the middle of November. We both just got jobs but with only one car and one of the jobs having been in walking distance of the place we were staying, we are likely to lose one of them and it's going to put us both into homelessness. We don't have money to get an apartment or efficiency so if we don't get some kind of help soon, we will end up living out of our car.


	We came here to live with my girlfriend's family after being in a very abusive situation with my girlfriends dad for a year, a man who physically assaulted my girlfriend multiple times during that period. Her mom told us that if we came and lived with her that she promised we won't be homeless, said it straight to my girlfriends face after her crying on the couch when we got here over the thought that she might end up being homeless.


 It's a dangerous world, and for two trans girls living on the streets, with the murder and rape numbers for transwomen, neither she nor I feel safe. To kick us more, we're getting thrown out in winter where it get's down to the negatives here, so we'd be lucky to even survive that let alone the potential threat of rape and possibly murder that we would face living on the streets alone to fend for ourselves.


	I'd get it if we were a cis straight couple or even gay couple because they would be able to force themselves to not stand out, but we've both been on hormones for years now and we wouldn't be able to conceal our gender or sexuality very well to protect ourselves if we ended up becoming homeless and forced around people who generally don't take very kindly to people of different genders and sexualities than their own.


	So, we've come here to ask for any help we can get, big or small, to support us and repair a false promise and to ensure our survival in this cruel, cruel world. Thank you so much for reading this, my love goes out to everyone who has a heart to help.",trans,Trans and About to Be Homeless,1542956429.0,"{'created_utc': 1542931229, 'id': '9zjaal', 'num_comments': 37, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""\nHello,\n\n\tWe are two transgender girls who just moved from a far away state on a simple promise, that if we got here we would have until January 1st to find a job and get back on our feet.

To kick us more, we're getting thrown out in winter where it get's down to the negatives here, so we'd be lucky to even survive that let alone the potential threat of rape and possibly murder that we would face living on the streets alone to fend for ourselves.\n\n\n\tI'd get it if we were a cis straight couple or even gay couple because they would be able to force themselves to not stand out, but we've both been on hormones for years now and we wouldn't be able to conceal our gender or sexuality very well to protect ourselves if we ended up becoming homeless and forced around people who generally don't take very kindly to people of different genders and sexualities than their own.\n\n\n\tSo, we've come here to ask for any help we can get, big or small, to support us and repair a false promise and to ensure our survival in this cruel, cruel world.

2018-11-24 13:25:29,9zyfgx,0,1,"One year ago yesterday was when I finally accepted that I was incredibly unhappy with trying to be a man. With being seen as a man. I had realized I might be trans once before, about 2.5 years ago but I was too scared and talked myself into being ok with being a very feminine dude. I have regretted that ever since. 

One year ago I was lying in bed after a thanksgiving party at our friends house, where I had been told that I couldn't come to the girls night they were organizing. I was lying in of girlfriends arms and just couldn't stop crying. I went back and forth between sobbing uncontrollably and screaming in rage over how unfair it was that I was “born a man”. 

What followed were months and months of agonizing over who I was, over how I could find a way to actually live, to make my life worth living, to be able to love myself and turn my life around. 

I was so incredibly scared. Scared of losing my partner, of losing friends and family, of this not being the right thing for me. I didn't know what to do, where this path would lead me, if I would ever get to a point where I was going to be even remotely comfortable and happy. 

By March I had accepted myself as Laura. As a woman who had every right to exist and to be happy. But even though I experienced incredible support from friends and family and even though my partner was unbelievable supportive (I wouldn't be here today without her), I was still scared. I was still insecure, I still hated my body and was still depressed. 

I am lucky enough to live in a place where my insurance covers all my transition costs and I could get access to HRT without any problems. I have been on HRT for a little over two months, next to the almost immediate benefits to my mental health, I can already see very obvious physical changes that make me so much more confident. 

I just spend a day with my grandparents who are incredibly supportive, my relationship with my partner has never been better, my job allowed me to change my email and ID as soon as I told them, all of my friends and almost all my family has been very supportive, I haven't experienced any kind of aggressive transphobia in the city I live in, basically everyone around me accepts me the way I am. 

I guess there is no real point to my post. Yesterday, when I realized what day it was, I started thinking about all that happened this past year. I am overwhelmed by the love and support, by how lucky I have been and how much happier I am than i ever thought I could be. I wish I could tell my last self all of this, could help her get through this scary and difficult time. 

Since I can't do that, I wanna tell anyone else who needs to hear it. You are valid. You are beautiful and you have every right in the world to make the changes you need to make to be happy. No matter what those are. There will always be people who love you and who will support you. If no one else, there are always people in this beautiful community who will be there for you.

Half of that is because he's disabled and needs someone and the other half is because my life was a wreck and I would be homeless without him. Long story short, I recently decided to start HRT and stop being an alcoholic and get my life together. My dad is an old school Mississippi farm boy. There's no way he would understand and accept what I am and what I'm doing. Plus, he's in bad health and nearing the end of his life. My sister and I agreed to just let him go in peace without this bombshell of his son being a female. He is the only person in my life now that doesn't know.   
.  
So here comes the lie part. I'm going to tell him I got a job in the same industry but a state away. He knows I've had alcohol issues and depression issues. He knows I'm seeing doctors (just doesn't know I'm seeing them to get my girly pills). I'm going to tell him that it's better for my health if I move away to a new area and get a new start. He knows I've been slowly getting better. He knows I'm highly respected at my job. It will be believable and pleasant. His care responsibility will be shifted onto my sister and/or nurses.

I have to move out though. The breasts are growing. I'm slowly but surely growing my hair out. I'm buying new clothes.  I have no guilt in leaving.

2018-11-25 05:57:00,a065g9,1,1,"**If your gender dysphoria is easily triggered be warned** 

Full disclosure, I'm 23 mtf (pre-transition) who truly came out to themselves recently. This was in part due to an experience that I had recently, but I wanna share how I got there.

As a preface I always had the sneaking suspicion that I wasn't really a guy on the inside. 2 or 3 years ago I tossed around the idea maybe I was trans, but because of many other more pressing things going on I suppressed that and just distracted myself with computers and video games.

I used to view certain emotions and sensations as ""bad"" and things that should be avoided. And (partially) as a result I lived my life having very stunted and almost non-existent feeling and emotionality, with only recent months opening up to experiencing *anything*, whether it be something we commonly judge as ""positive"" or ""negative"".

A wise person once told me that it's perfectly okay to feel. To ""be fully present in your body and in this moment"". I intellectually knew this but I never truly practiced it and implemented it. That is, until this most recent Thanksgiving. Before this my focus in life was on very different things, and the idea of being trans wasn't even anywhere on it (at least not consciously).

I was sitting in my mom's car being driven to a dinner we were going to, and I decided to just put my headphones down, stop listening to music, and just sit there. I took deep breaths and just allowed myself to observe whatever was going on internally and externally. More specifically, I decided to do this while feeling like I was fully *in* my body rather just in my head like normal.

In just moments I was feeling true gender dysphoria for the first time. I felt how my penis truly felt like some weird additional appendage that shouldn't have been there. Later on I had a moment when I really felt the testosterone in my bloodstream, and the dysphoria was getting pretty intense. And now even as I type this I occasionally feel like breasts both are and aren't there (phantom breasts you could say). Most trans folk I imagine would call this suffering, but I'm actually extremely grateful for this feeling. Because it's actually a feeling that truly and fully felt with my entire being. I fully embrace it if it ever comes up.

After my initial experience of dysphoria subsided, I was (and still am) excited because I know now without a doubt. Everything is clicking into place. To really feel something with your entire being is something truly special, and something I haven't really experienced in this life until now. Sure I'd occasionally feel some type of emotion or sensation, but it never truly *came out* if that makes sense. This does, and I have this knowing that if I do begin to transition other emotions of mine will follow.

I know there will be a lot of challenges ahead, and my dysphoria comes and goes with varying intensity. But I'm actually really eager to face this, and I'd like to share some of that positivity with you all. I hope that no matter where anyone is in their journey, they will feel at least a little fired up to face whatever it is they are facing.

Most trans folk I imagine would call this suffering, but I\'m actually extremely grateful for this feeling. Because it\'s actually a feeling that truly and fully felt with my entire being. I fully embrace it if it ever comes up.\n\nAfter my initial experience of dysphoria subsided, I was (and still am) excited because I know now without a doubt. Everything is clicking into place. To really feel something with your entire being is something truly special, and something I haven\'t really experienced in this life until now. Sure I\'d occasionally feel some type of emotion or sensation, but it never truly *came out* if that makes sense. This does, and I have this knowing that if I do begin to transition other emotions of mine will follow.\n\nI know there will be a lot of challenges ahead, and my dysphoria comes and goes with varying intensity. But I\'m actually really eager to face this, and I\'d like to share some of that positivity with you all. I hope that no matter where anyone is in their journey, they will feel at least a little fired up to face whatever it is they are facing.

My SO recently started a job and at this job she has a friend named Ash. Ash is a lovely person, and I like them a lot. What confuses me about them, however, is that they insist upon gender-neutral pronouns despite the fact that everything about this person is feminine. They dress, act, look, and conduct themselves in an entirely female way. They are in a committed heterosexual relationship, they wear exclusively womens clothing (not all the time. No woman does that, but you get what I mean), and they have extraordinarily feminine features.

Let’s just say I’m nuerodivergent, so it sort of makes sense id experience some dysphoria. My question is what to do about it?

I’ll explain. 

I have gender dysphoria.
Not a lot, not enough to be my main worry, but enough to make me wonder about transitioning, and how that would work for me. Thing is I don’t know that it would?

I don’t hate my tits, so I wouldn’t want top surgery. 

I don’t like my other intimate areas, but I don’t know that it would be feasible or smart to have bottom surgery only??

Presenting as female is something mostly neutral, just tinged with negative dysphoria for me. I really like girls, so I suppose I can appreciate my body from that perspective?

2018-11-27 06:55:45,a0sf9p,5,1,"(Sorry for the wall of text, TL;DR at the end if you don't like reading long posts)

A little over half a year ago, after six long years of struggling and internally debating, I came out as a transgender woman; and about six years ago, I started questioning the very world I lived in. If I'm being honest, I didn't think I'd live this long. And holy hell, I'm not living, *I'm thriving!*

I'm not just waking up and hating myself anymore! I'm making things! I'm creating! I'm making friendships and relationship, I'm excited for the future! I made it to 18 fucking years, and I am so happy! *I MADE IT!*

I'm so happy to celebrate this occasion; not as the angry, fearful boy I used to be, but the happy girl I was meant to be. 

I envisioned my whole family being here with me, but that, sadly, is not going to happy. For the first time since I was probably born, my grandparents are not invited to my birthday party. They were like a second set of parents for me, and they've been there with my family and I every single step of the way. I still love them, to say the least. 

But after I came out, they responded to my letter to them with a letter of their own. Mine was peaceful and cordial, and I wrote it solely because I was too nervous to speak and I knew they would need some help understanding me. I soon got a letter back, which I've thrown out, because it infuriates me.

Among other things in the five-page letter they wrote back (too be fair, mine was just a long, but I didn't even bother reading past page two.), they said **""a man cannot be a woman, and a woman cannot be a man, as decreed by God""**, and that the reason I'm feeling this way (seemingly my entire life) is because **""the devil is whispering in my ear""**.

I'm not paraphrasing. I'm not summarizing. Those are their *exact* words.

Those words make me want to punch a hole in the fucking wall (and this exchange happened a month or two ago)! I remembered how worried they were when I used to be extremely depressed, or I wouldn't come out of my rooms for a day or two. They always said they'd support me, as they just wanted me to be happy. Lo and behold, I'm having the time of my life, as I'm finally starting to be comfortable with myself. And they abandoned me like trash. I guess I've expired my usefulness.

I don't know what to feel. I have a million emotions flying through my head at the moment and its 00:49. I'm sad I had to lose them over something like this, but I'm also pissed off that I resort to this just so I don't feel like a freak. I still haven't told them, but I don't know how I'm going to tell them that they're not welcome in the very house the helped build. That's all I can do really, I guess. Only one of us can change, and I sure as hell can't.

""Won't hide"" = I'm coming out. ""Come with me"" = Let's do it together, as in, do it with me, so we stand together - basically following Harvey Milk's idea of how we can normalise trans* people and build tolerance.

&gt; We're going on a ride

Moving from one thing to another - the personal experience of transformation.

&gt; We meet each day, use time to see

Stand together, let's support each other.

&gt; While we're young and almost free

Don't keep postponing your transformation, nor the work to change society towards tolerance and acceptance. We're not *quite* free from our self internalised denial/self-loathing, etc., nor the discriminatrion and hate we face from society at large.

*Chorus*

&gt; I've got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in
&gt; Got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in

I need to change - ""this skin"" is the body/gender I was born into, but it's a prison, I can't realise myself in it.

*Second verse*

&gt; Do not turn our head to see

&gt; All the things you think we've got

&gt; Do not turn or hate to see

&gt; What happened to the wife of Lot

Most lyrics on the internet say it's ""turn or hate to see"", but that doesn't make sense, unless it's a play on words, when you consider the parallel to the wife of Lot below.  
Anyway, again, this is a parallel to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where God says they're not to look back when they flee, or they'll be turned to pillars of salt. Lot's wife does it anyway, and does indeed turn to salt. Anyway, I think this could mean that we shouldn't grow complacent towards change - we still have a road ahead.

*Chorus

*Third verse*

&gt; We're alone or so they say

We're told that we're freaks, this is not normal. We're pariahs, not conforming to expected standards of gender.

&gt; We're not on our own in that way

But he's saying, that's not true. We've got each other, and we've got allies.

&gt; When we're alone it's real tough going

But it's really fucking rough when you feel like you're alone. When you feel like you're a freak for experiencing dysphoria - especially the case for a lot of young people that are not familiar with the fact that they're not alone in their experience.

&gt; We can take a part in someone else's play

But we *can* be there together, support and reassure each other.

*Chorus*

*Fourth verse*

&gt; Come with me, I thought he said

I'm not sure - this sounds like he/she thought they had a friend and an ally. But it turns out they ended up shunning them. I'm not sure, though, when you consider the rest of the verse.

&gt; But that's not him anymore, he's dead

They're not who I thought they were. I've cut ties, because I don't deserve their hate.  
Alternately, though I don't know how this would relate to the previous part of the verse: it could be another trans* who's ""died"" and ""reborn"". They've transformed from their old self, to become their true selves.

&gt; What's it like to be so free

How does it feel to finally be free from that hate? Or, alternately, how does it feel to finally have gone through that transformation, and finally, physically, be your real self.

&gt; So free it looks like lost to me

How does it feel to be free from the cage that was the hate of their ""friend"", or free from the dysphoria of feeling trapped in a body that's not yours.

---

Well, this might not be the original intention of what the song is supposed to be about. It could also be about other ways of feeling alone and shunned, or a host of other things. Though, as I recall, Joe Strummer *did* have an intersex friend and mentor in the 70's. I believe I read that, but now I can't find any sources confirming that.  
In any case, when it comes to art, while it's interesting to ponder the intent of the piece, your own experience and interpretation is just as valid. ""We Are Family"" is the first thing that comes to mind - it wasn't meant to be a queer anthem, but it's now been co-opted, the original artists, Sister Sledge, they've embraced that. I think that has value too.

I guess I should say that I'm not trans* myself, though I am queer, and a big trans* ally. When I use ""I"" or ""we"" in the commentary, it's from the narrator's perspective. I won't pretend to understand your experience completely, but I can emphasise, and try to support my transgender friends as best I can. Anyway, like I said, I haven't experienced your going through what you're going through, and I apologise if I've said anything that might be offensive, or misunderstood something. I *can* say that it's all in good faith, though. :)

Well, a bit of a long winded wall of text, all this, but it was nice for me to put down in writing, and sharing - and if any of this makes sense to someone else, all the better. :)

2018-11-30 08:03:07,a1qio5,20,1,"Hello. I am a 35 year old male and last month or two I have been struggling with the question above. I have been fantasizing about what it would be like as a female for around 20 years, but always believed it was nothing more that that. I have asked myself the trans question over those 20 years a lot and my answer (until recently) was always no. But (I think) mainly because I didn't want to be a transwoman. Mainly because of my believe that transwomen could never 100% pass (forgive my ignorance here please). And because becoming an actual natural women was not an option I always left it at that. However I have been looking at /r/transtimelines lately and I feel it has changed my mind on the transwoman option a little. So I have been thinking some more about it and here are my (conflicting) conclusions, so I hoped the lovely people in this subreddit could provide some objective advice.

**Why I think I am trans:**

* If I had a button that would permanently transform me into a natural female, would I press it? Yes
* I have been ""into"" gender transformation art (like [tgcomics.com](https://tgcomics.com)) for over 10 years now
* I am mesmerized by the female filter of FaceApp on the phone. It has created tons of cute female versions of myself
* 95% of my sexual fantasies are about me being or transforming into a woman.
* I envy woman I see in public if they have long hair or are wearing leggings, skinny jeans or a dress. Women have so much more options in clothing it's not even funny.
* If I have the option to play as a female in any kind of game (or d&amp;d), I do. And not ""so I can look at a female body all day"" or whatever that excuse is.

**Why I think I am not trans:**

* I am living a happy life. I have a wife and a son whom I love dearly.
* If I look in the mirror I don't feel anything negative, more like boredom or indifference.
* I have a male mind with male mannerisms. I have studied (as in, read a few books on the subject, not created an actual thesis) the psychological differences between men and women and I definitely fit in the male category.
* I feel way more ""at home"" in a group of men than in a group of women.
* I can see myself living a happy life and growing old as a man. There are enough things in the world that make me happy. 

As you can see I am a bit conflicted on the subject. Maybe I am trans but have learned to live with it? Maybe it's that simple?

What I also think is interesting is I have a pretty good sense of identity. I know and love who I am as a person. However being male is not a part of that. Masculinity is not a part of my identity. You could take my ""manhood"" (literally and figuratively) away from me and that would not hurt my identity at all. Maybe this is the solution my brain has come up with to handle my gender dysphoria in my teens? I don't know.
