I have stopped going to the local transgender support group.  I give myself hours and hours to femme up for it (and I even have a girlfriend willing to do my make-up for me).  But when I get to the point where I've shaved my face and showered and it's time to get dressed, I either get unbearably nervous and/or I manifest these strong headaches.  I think the headaches are a defense mechanism, my inner critic subconsciously trying to protect me from rejection.  If I'm in too much pain to leave the house, no one can see and reject my girl self.  I hate going in boy mode and introducing myself with my female name.  I feel like a fraud, especially when most everyone else is dressed and looking good.  

I would really like to be able to attend the trans events that are 90 minutes away.  Those ladies don't just have meetings.  They go out, dance, and have fun.  I got to hang with them after Pride one year.  But it's going to take a lot of baby steps to get to that point.  

I put a lot of my female self on the back burner about six years ago to deal with family drama.  And then it kept going.

This is small potatoes to some of you who are brave enough to be transitioning/have transitioned, but to me it was a big deal. I've always been afraid of the judgment and how I'd be treated if I did so.

Also, for background, I am most probably trans but too much of a pussy to go through with any actual transitioning (mainly because I couldn't bear to come out to my family, who is not really cool with that kind of thing and would disown me). So I settle for dressing up and pretending, which I've always done in private, until last night.

The place I went was a drag show at a gay bar, so pretty much the most supportive possible environment for my first time doing this. Though of course I still had to walk to and from my car out in the ""regular"" world. One of my neighbors, who hangs out on his porch all the time, saw me and did look pretty surprised... I do wonder if he'll say anything to me next time he sees me.

Overall, people paid far less attention to me than I feared. In fact, after I was starting to feel comfortable I kinda wanted more attention, because I thought I was looking pretty cute tbh! Of course, it was a gay bar, so not all that surprising.

One thing I noticed is that when interacting with others, women (who I don't know) were far more likely to physically touch me, like a light shoulder touch or whatever, which is something that basically never happens as a man. Everybody was really nice, I did get a lot of smiles, and even got called ""sweetie"" (which I liked, and also something that never happens as a man).

Holy shit is it a bitch to stay in heels for hours though! I've worn them around the house of course, but never for that long continuously before. And they were wedge heels, not even crazy stilettos or anything. That part is really gonna take some getting used to.

2018-07-05 21:44:35,8wefmu,0,2,"Hello! I posted here about six days ago. I’ve come a bit of ways between then and now. I’ve looked into gender dysphoria and have read stories about trans men and even trans women. I couldn’t relate to every single detail about trans men, but I related to over a handful of it. 

I noticed that a sign of gender dysphoria or just a sign that you could be transgender in general is having a general discomfort with life. Well, not exactly general, but you just feel so uncomfortable with literally everything. 

I’m uncomfortable with my body, uncomfortable with the way I live and where I live, and it’s just an overall feeling of being uncomfortable. It just doesn’t feel right. Nothing feels right. I’ve noticed how I feel when people refer to me as a girl and part of the time it’s like “I’m gonna act like that didn’t happen” and other times it’s like “I hate this don’t say my name don’t say that” I keep those feelings to myself though. The idea of being referred to as a male is a little uncomfortable and I’ve done it multiple times. I end up feeling scared and uncomfortable and I turn back. I believe that could be because I’m not used to it and I’m afraid that they may find it weird and still see me as a girl. 

I have a friend who is ftm and we’re very close. He always lets me ask him questions and I asked him if he felt uncomfortable and nervous about wearing boxers at first. He said yes but he got used to it and now cannot imagine wearing panties again. I hate panties and have never worn them but I think I’d wanna try wearing boxers somehow. I just wanna take small steps to see what feels the most right and what makes me feel better. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt the general dissatisfaction with life and felt uncomfortable from just existing. Possibly even felt paranoid or this unexplainable sense of dread that you’ll die. Maybe it’s the news that’s making me feel this way. I just wanna know if I’m not alone.

2018-07-11 13:17:27,8xzhkm,5,12,"First time poster. I usually spend my time on this sub looking at all your gorgeous faces and thinking “YES MAMA” and “YES PAPA” and “YES YOU BEAUTIFUL ENBY ANGEL”.

So I’ve been thinking that maybe I’m trans for a few months and then, while speaking to one of my trans friends, it just sorta clicked.

I’ve never felt particularly “manly” or that the label of “man” fit me. Since I was about 19 I started identifying as non-binary. That worked while I was studying because I could just wear and act however I wanted but then I graduated and had to get a real job. I grew a beard and started acting more masc to fit in with the kind of people I work with. (Coming out as trans at work is gonna be HELL but that’s for future me to worry about.) So the acting manly thing really triggered some dysphoria and discomfort for me. I thought maybe I just wanted to present as NB more often (I use they/them pronouns) but, long story short, I’m a woman.

I’ve come out to a few close friends and it’s been amazing. They’ve been so supportive and helpful and caring and it’s made me feel incredible. Obviously I’m a long way off HRT or any procedures, but I have an appointment with my doctor to get the ball rolling soon.

My problem is the interaction I had with my partner when I came out to her (cis woman, been together 7 years). She’s always been accepting of and comfortable with me identifying as NB but I’m starting to think that comes down to how masc I was presenting because of work and where I live. She doesn’t care that I’m trans. She is happy to be in a relationship with a woman and if I could flick a switch tomorrow and wake up a cis woman, she’s still be here and happy.

But she’s worried about our safety and how she’s going to have to approach her family. We may have to move because of the area we live in. Her family and our neighbours think I’m just a cis man because who has time for the NB conversation with obvious bigots? But I want to be an out trans woman. I want to present as a woman in public and at family events. And this seems to make her very uncomfortable. I understand the safety issue because I might have a hard time passing (big chin, like 3-foot shoulders and I have to shave my face twice a day), but I tried to convince her it’s all a long way off and I haven’t even spoken to a doctor yet. But for me it’s getting more and more real and I want things to move as quickly as possible. How do I make her feel OK? I told her I understood if she didn’t want to go through all this and that I’d understand if she wanted to leave. Her life shouldn’t have to get worse because of me, but she says “I’m gonna have to do it because I love you”. Which was nice to hear but it feels like I’m forcing her into a different, dangerous life where she might have to cut ties with her family.

2018-07-13 01:07:11,8yfjxr,12,27,"Hey all, this is my first post here, and honestly I don’t know exactly what I’m asking for apart from hopefully respectful sharing of advice and life experience. I think I’m goin through a bit of an identity crisis right now, and friends always help with that. Please read to the end for a fuller understanding of where I’m coming from.

When I got to college I did what many do with their newfound freedom, I began to push the boundaries I previously had living in a conservative home and began to form my own identity apart from my family. I was attending a Christian college on a dance scholarship. I had been dancing ballet for almost a decade at that point, which meant I grew up with people assuming I was gay. I have never been attracted to men, so that was pretty problematic. I had mostly girl friends and few girlfriends. Anyway, at college I met a girl, Mona, online. She was from California, where I was from, and we seemed to have a lot in common. The hours I wasn’t spending doing school things or playing video games or dancing, we were talking. I began to think of her as my girlfriend. The problem was she only ever sent me 3 photos of herself, the same 3, whenever I asked. I sent her many, she sent only 3. Red flag, I know, with hindsight, but I began to love that person I messaged everyday. At first I thought that maybe she had gained weight or something had happened to where she didn’t feel comfortable sending more recent or candid photos.

Eventually she began suggesting things. She maintained that she was a cisgender, heterosexual woman, however she would suggest I experiment with my roommates or ask if I had ever thought of sucking dick, along with many other things. Now, as I said, I came from a very conservative home, but grew up in the ballet world, meaning I really had no objection to anyone’s sexual orientation or identity, I just identified, at the time, as strictly hetero, and I felt like we were in a relationship together, at least that’s how I viewed it, so the thought of sexually experimenting with anyone else was out of the question. Eventually I began to connect the dots and had to confront the feelings I had. She kept suggesting trying things that can’t be done with the female body, and she would only send me the same 3 pictures over and over again. I realized that she was either very open minded and for some reason wouldn’t ever send new pictures, or that she was a trans woman or gay man that didn’t feel comfortable sharing more of themselves yet. 

To this day I don’t know what became of Mona. What I do know is that I came to the conclusion that regardless of her gender or sexual identity, whatever she looked like, I had come to know her. I loved her personality and her playfulness, her openness and how she honestly cared for me while we were getting to know each other. I came to the realization that whatever I thought my sexual identity to be, it had expanded to let her in. Whatever the whole truth was I was in love and it didn’t matter to me. But we lost contact, and my biggest regret is that I never had the opportunity to express all of that to her and that at the end of our 2 or 3 year correspondence I still hadn’t helped her feel comfortable enough in me or us for her to share all of herself with me.

That was.... 8 or 9 years ago. Since then I’ve been married, had kids, and am now separated. Since meeting Mona, from mostly my inability to fully articulate what I felt or who I was afterward, because i am most definitely changed, my marriage struggled and Ive felt so conflicted for so long. My wife was born into the same religion I was, and we had tried to practice it especially after our kids were born, but one of the biggest things that shook me with regards to my identity was qualifying my experience with what I had been taught growing up about the LGBTQ community. Homosexuality is obviously taboo with conservative Christians, and the basis for that is a terrible and completely ignorant assumption that sexual and gender identity is purely a choice for those who don’t conform to cisgender norms, and that any act outside of that very small circle of understanding is a conscious rebellion against God. In other words, they disregard the concept that any member of the LGBTQ community can love like they do. They demean every single non-heteronormative relationship to it’s basest level as purely physical and therefore immoral. But I have loved a woman, and I have loved Mona. It felt just as impactful and life changing, I got the same butterflies, and both made me a better person. 

So here I am! Completely alone after 8 years of marriage, I don’t know what to believe with regards to my faith that I really do cherish and I don’t exactly know how I identify now. I know I do believe there is a God, and I believe God loves everyone regardless of who they are, how they identify, what race or religion they are, whatever. I know that whatever my next relationship will be, whether a cisgender woman or a trans woman, I will love them with equal fervor and hopefully as a more aware and whole partner. So what am I? Where do I fit in? Who are my people? Because the things I know now are not things that the people I have as friends or family now agree with. 

This has been a whole bunch of emotional vomit....I apologize. But any advice or support or friendship would be so very appreciated. Please be kind, if I said anything offensive or ignorant, please let me know politely, I have never shared this story with anyone at all.

I just need to vent about my feelings on being transgender and single, I’m the only trans person I have in my life so it’s isolating, and I can’t talk to people I know because they won’t understand, and in many instances I’m not out.
Anyway, at this point in my life I just feel like I’m ready to find someone, but being a trans man attracted to men feels impossible.

The trans population is already small, and I’d rather date a trans man than a cis man anyway, but we are so few and far between it feels hopeless. and finding someone that fits well with me is even more challenging. Other men are so impossible to navigate as well, I’m too emotional for them, and I was raised with my sisters and mother, never had any male friends, so I don’t even know how to do that much! 😶

Always saying that no matter what I would never be a “real man”, and what I hate most is that he’s right. I hate that I can never be proper because of how I look, no matter how much hormones I take.

my youngest brother has always been more attracted to feminine clothes - one of my first memories of him actively making choices is when he was 3 or 4 and he picked a pair of dainty white dress shoes and ran around the shoe store giggling like a maniac. his favorite color is pink pink pink pink pink, he sits cross-legged, has long hair (he flips out when my dad threatens to cut it. like, flips. out.) more stuff:

* loves painting his nails, wearing make up
* once stuffed tissue paper up his shirt to make a joke about boobs, then walked around the house staring at his chest. left the tissue paper in his shirt for like two hours

I do however hold a viewpoint that may conflict with your own and I am curious to see why I may be wrong about this subject. To me , a trans person is not technically ( through chromosomes and genes) the gender they attribute themselves to be. Sure they may look, act and feel like the opposite sex but biologically even if you were to have a sex change you cannot change your genetic makeup . When I meet a man who transitioned into being a “woman” and they tell me to call them a “woman” I do out of respect for them but I also cringe inside because to me that person is not biologically a woman. That person is a man who had an operation to look like a woman and therefore I believe the term should be something along the lines of “transsexual man”. Since the man is not a biologically a woman why should I be forced to call them a woman? Can’t there be another more honest term to be used?

A long journey of pinpointing what I wanted. In the end, however, I was just running away from the truth. Too scared to face it. So when I finally came out to her she cried. For like, an hour and a half actually. 

She was upset about things changing and the huge challenges to come. She was scared just as I was but mostly worried for me. She didn't question us. She had to let go of some fantasies of how we are going to grow old together but I think she took it pretty well considering. She didn't once question my validity.

2018-07-16 23:12:57,8zfvt1,8,8,"Hello everyone.

I'm... confused. For five years I've been dealing with the secret that I thought that I was transgender, but now I'm not so sure.

I started questioning it at 12, but since I came out to my friends I started to question it. At which point I got myself into a negative feedback loop, saying over and over again:

1. The fact you're questioning it in the first place ought to amount to something.
2. But now you're questioning the questioning, that means you can't *definitely* be transgender.
3. But if I'm not, why would I still have doubts about it?

And so on. This is compounded from when I told my mum - probably not the best idea I've had - who despite believing in liberal values, has a hard time actually enforcing those values in her day-to-day life. She has an unconscious socially conservative alignment.

The friends I have told have been supportive and I'm happy I have people who do support me, but my mum's incessant questioning and repetition of things such as ""As your mother, I genuinely don't think you'd be any happier as a woman"" cuts deep but I don't know if it's because I agree or she is inadvertently shunning me.

I don't know how to feel about this - I've come here for help, has anyone had any experiences like this before? Does anyone have any advice?

For awhile I blew most of these things off as being a tomboy, but for some time now I've been feeling different.

This desire has only grown as I've gotten older. Something else that really brought on these thoughts was when I was buying some new clothes a couple weeks ago. I have always worn boys clothing now and then (I feel it suits me better), but this time I tried on a bit of a nicer mens dress shirt. I remember when I looked in the mirror I actually felt kind of happy with my appearance for once. I felt more comfortable in my own skin, something that I struggle with a lot.

Underneath

That mask it fits so snug,

When she wakes up to the day.

Sometimes it’s so easy to forget,

There could be another way.

The slits too narrow for seeing,

The wood is old and worn.

Always it keeps her from being,

The person as she was born.

She can’t feel simple contact,

The mask makes sure of that.

It even covers her emotions,

To keep her from a laugh.

But somehow no one else sees

The disguise that’s plainly there.

Do they really not notice?

Or do they just not fucking care?

What makes a life worth living

When you it is a lie?

And the mask that hides your face

Makes you want to die.

If the truth would just come out.

Her life would change so much.

The mask need simply shatter,

For her skin to feel a touch.

But heavy are the words

To liberate her life.

So quiet stays her tongue,

As her soul continues its strife.",trans,A little Creative Writing,1532088909.0,"{'created_utc': 1532063709, 'id': '90d7i0', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 5, 'selftext': ""Here's a quick poem I wrote.

2018-07-22 18:58:44,9102og,8,21,"Hey guys! So I am a lovely lesbian who has recently moved to a new state and after getting involved in the LGBT community here (in a much bigger city than where I am from) I've made a few new trans friends (yeah!). I hadn't ever met any trans people before, so I was excited for the opportunity, but now I have a question about something I've noticed!

Anyway. So these new friends are still just that, new, so we are all getting to know each other but already I've noticed one thing about the trans folk in the community that seems different than the rest of us. So with my lesbian or gay friends, we talk about sex, who we are attracted to, and swap risqué stories ect. just like what the average mid-twenty year olds do. But the trans people in our group aren't always as vocal about themselves, and the participate in the conversation only when its in involving somebody else. After talking with some people about why it seems discussing sex in the trans community almost feels like taboo, because to me thats sorta what it felt like!, most everyone said something like ""well they are going through so much physically/emotionally ect. that we never wanted to push them, or make them feel uncomfortable.""

Well I feel like not feeling comfortable to talk/ask about it amongst friends is awful!!! I love having the comfortability to just joke, or share or whatever you feel comfortable with about your sex life with my buddies.

So my question is this. What would be the best way to bring up sexuality to a new trans friend? I am getting to know these folks really well, and even if they don't want to be as vocal about sex, I still want them to feel comfortable enough to feel like they could share with me if they wanted to! I think all love is beautiful, but I also don't want to offend them by just straight up asking ""so if you are a trans man, who do you like?""

But then also part two of the question. Is there any research about the tendencies of the trans community? Like, or most trans-men gay, or straight and the same for trans-women. Just curious!

Any insight would be much appreciated!

2018-07-23 12:27:28,916men,7,2,"Hello.

I've been struggling to understand my gender identity. I am confused as to how I ""should"" express myself, whether it is useful for me to outwardly express my gender, how to deal with having an non-catered to body shape, and whether what I'm feeling is relatable to others in the trans community.   


I would like to share some of the experiences that lead me to my confusion. **I think what I'm looking for is for others who might have had similar experiences to share with me. Whether these are things they have related to, or which they may have more articulated thoughts on**. I'm particularly confused as to whether feelings of discomfort around being associated with the ""feminine"" are brought on by my being socialised as a ""lesser/oppressed"" gender, whether perhaps the role models I had or early childhood traumas shaped my understanding of my gender identity, or whether perhaps it's something more than that, (Whatever ""more than that"" even is?) or if that even matters.   


*I appreciate that there is a lot of text here that might be difficult to read, and I am so grateful to those of you who feel able to read all or part of it.*  


**To give some context, this is a bit about my family unit/society/early childhood traumas growing up: (CW: there's some racism/sexism/potential sexual abuse discussion in this paragraph)**

\-I was born biologically female, in NJ, in the early 90s. My mother was my primary guardian. Since my mother's first language was Spanish, and I grew up in a society which demonised Mexican immigrants, I think I thought lesser of my mother's intellect than she deserved. I was always white-passing, despite a large portion of my family being from Argentina. I didn't learn Spanish as a child and this made it difficult for me to connect to a lot of my mother and her family's culture. For other reasons, she had always been quite a vulnerable person and I did not think of her as somebody I aspired to be like. I did not always have a father figure present. My biological father died when I was 2, so I have almost no memories of him. My mother re-married to my step-father when I was about 5, and stayed with him until I was 11. I sometimes bonded with him over video games, outdoor activities, love of animals, and hockey games. We were never particularly close though, and hadn't kept in contact after their divorce. I didn't have any biological grand-fathers or uncles in my life, really. My Mother's family were mostly living in Italy, and my father's parent was essentially my (lesbian?) Grandmother, who's ex-man left her pregnant at 18 to go to Woodstock and live a free spirited hippie lifestyle.  I think just about all of the women in my life had been abused by their partners or family members, though I'm not sure how aware I was of this as a child. I remember my step father getting into physical fights with my mother, but I don't remember how one-sided this was or not. I had been (possibly?) molested multiple times as a 7 year old child by a male 15 year-old step-cousin, but honestly I always understood this as being kind of consensual. I was very sexually curious. I don't really know what to think about this looking back on it as it feels quite different to other's stories I've heard, but that's a bit of an aside. 

  
**Reflecting on my childhood (4-11ish), here's what I remember that sets of flags:**  


\-My mother gave me a very, very feminine name. I remember always wishing I could have a cooler nickname like the other kids.  In fact, when I moved to a new town at 11, I made up a new name for myself which wasn't masculine, but was much less ""soft"" sounding. 

\-I absolutely hated the colour pink.

\-I hated being called ""cute."" I think I might have even asked people to call me ""Beautiful"" or ""Handsome"". 

\-I tore the heads off of barbie dolls that my family would get for me. Sometimes I even play-tortured them. 

\-I refused to be a ""flower girl"" at my mother's second wedding, instead taking on the role of the ring bearer. (Which was typically a boy's role.)

\-I really liked video games and computers. My favourites were in the Mario series, Harvest Moon, Tomb Raider, Online RPG games, The Sims, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Kingdom Hearts, Star Fox. Not a lot of first person shooters. If I would be making a character in the game, I would usually make a female character that I thought was more attractive than myself.

\-My favourite TV shows were Thunder Cats, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, Gargoyles, The Mighty Ducks, and Xena the Warrior Princess.   

\-I really liked drawing and painting. This was probably one of the only things my mother and I bonded over. The focus of my drawings were most typically of natural/non-human things. Animals, trees, pokemon, landscapes... Although sometimes I would draw female characters from Disney films and things. I think my favourites were usually more fantastical, like The Little Mermaid or The Lion King. I also really liked Mulan.

\-I always had ""crushes"" on other young boys, even though I knew they would never really like me back. I was quite romantic, and lonely. I was always quite ashamed and secretive about this, though. 

\-I was very curious about sexuality from a very early age. Through having access to the internet in the 90s and online rpg games, I would seek out pornography in verbal and visual forms. I think this was probably largely female body focused pornography, and I was attracted to that. I remember having secret thoughts of aspiring to be a prostitute from as early as 7 years old or so.

\-I would find it made me feel good to go into boy's bathrooms. I don't know if this was rebelling against the norms for my sex or that I liked the ""shock factor"" of it. (I still do this, usually when I'm drunk.)

\-I was quite aggressive towards my peers at times, especially boys who made fun of me. I would bite kids ears in pre-school and have fond memories of kicking bullies in the balls. 

\-I never really followed any fashionable trends or thought about my body image until I was about 12, when I began to adorn myself in alternative clothing. (Went through Goth phase, Scene Queen phase, Grungey phase... Probably the earliest I remember of having any identity expression.)

**Teenage experiences / young adulthood / sexuality;**

\-At about 11, I started to go through puberty. I was also dealing with moving to a new town, my mother's divorce, and being separated from her due to her ill mental health. I ended up getting into a lot of trouble and generally being problematic. There are so many factors that I have no idea how much puberty and my own awareness of my changing body played into that. 

\-In my early teens, I remember feeling quite prejudiced towards most other girls around me. I didn't feel like I fit in amongst the very feminine girl groups who were into hair/make-up/fashion, etc. Although I had an interest in these things related to my ""alternative"" expression, I felt some kind of superiority to very feminine women. I assumed they weren't interested in more intellectual topics like I was. I only ever made friends with more ""edgey"" people because I assumed they might have interests more aligned to my own. I generally preferred to have male friends, but this was often a conflicting factor in my friendships because at the time I understood myself to be a straight girl. (i.e; I would make friendships which I often felt as if I was a target for romantic interest to my male friends. I felt they treated me differently because I was a girl.) I don't remember having had any obviously gender-queer or LGBT+ people around me in my early teens, although topics of bisexuality or homosexuality started to float around in the more ""alternative"" scenes as I grew into that. 

\-I had been in an unhealthy relationship when I was 15 with a man who was 19. Although unhealthy, this man helped me understand what I was attracted to in other people. I liked philosophy, the arts, and weird, metaphysical discussions of the absurdity of life. I liked people who were politically aware and ""intellectual"" types. I wrongly assumed on a subconscious level that I could not actually be romantically attracted to women because some part of me assumed this was not a feminine trait. 

\-After an extended experience of being institutionalised following psychological damage from that relationship, I suddenly found myself to be a fairly independent 17 year old.  I partied a lot, experimented with mind altering substances, and somewhere along the way ended up having a threesome with one of my girl friends and another man. After that experience, I started to pay more attention to my physical attraction to women. 

\-Typically, I dressed quite feminine albeit still pretty alternative. My aesthetic at the time was thrift shop dresses and short, asymmetric haircuts. 

\-Around the same time, I seemed to recognise a pattern of me being attracted to more effeminate men. Friends of mine would often confuse my romantic interests for gay men. (Perhaps this was related to me also be averse towards macho men or ""athletic"" people, on the more masculine side of the spectrum.)

\-Regarding my attraction to women, I generally felt this to be more physical than romantic at first. I didn't feel physical attraction in the same way to men, which led me to think that perhaps I was a lesbian. 

\-When I moved away to the UK for university, I experienced my first (complicated) relationship (of sorts) with a woman. It was a very physical attraction, and this was something that was new to me. I was attracted to her intellect as well, but I felt like the pull of her physicality was what kept me interested most. 

\-I shaved my head, and put myself on a very restrictive diet which allowed me to dress comfortably androgynous and feel expressive of my sexuality. (I've struggled with being overweight since puberty, and the effects of having a very obviously plump curvy body were unfavourable to me.)

\-After that relationship, I ended up working as a stripper. Ironically, this is when I first adapted a non-binary stripper name. It was just a way to make money for me, even though I had a largely male client base. 

\-Between 18-21ish, I thought I was a lesbian. I started hanging out in more LGBT+ communities as a consequence. I felt mostly attracted to feminine or androgynous women, though I have also had feelings of attraction towards several trans men and non-binary people during this time. 

\-I ended up in a more serious, romantic relationship with a woman in Italy for about 3 years. This was not a healthy relationship by the end of it. Towards the end I started to feel physical attraction to men again, and felt quite ashamed of this. In lesbian circles, I felt ""dirty"" for having these feelings.  The relationship ended largely because of my sexual confusion at the time.  


**Where I'm at now;**

 \-After accepting these sides of my sexuality, I think I can now comfortably say that I identity as pansexual. I have felt attraction to cis men, cis women, trans men, trans women, and non binary people. Though, I'm still not sure how I see my own gender identity or how this influences my relationships with other people. I like to think that the subjectivity of a person is the most important aspect of my attraction to them, though I feel perhaps I don't have a deep understanding of how gender identity shapes my particular interactions with partners or even friends of mine. 

\-I an known amongst friends by an androgynous name, although because the name I'm known as isn't very socially acceptable - I still feel I need to (uncomfortably) use my birth name for work/university/IDs/etc. 

\-I  happen to be in a long term relationship with a straight, cis-male at present. 

\-I have gained a lot of weight again, and as a consequence it is incredibly difficult for me to find trouser that will fit me and/or that are flattering. I tend to have reverted to wearing mostly dresses, if for nothing else because they will actually fit me regardless of my weight and height.  

\-I feel quite ashamed of my body. I think this is mostly because of my weight, though I also do have feelings of wishing that people did not assume I was a woman when they look at me. I do not feel I want to be perceived as a man, but rather that I wish it was not obvious what sex/gender I was at all. 

\-I dislike shaving, but I do shave occasionally because I feel that this is one form of ""attractiveness"" that I can control relatively easily. 

\-I take birth control (synthetic progesterone) which stops me from having cyclical, hormonal mood swings and from menstruating. The main motive for this is because I did not like how my hormones affected my mood and cognitive function. I also like that I can us this as way to feel less dictated by my female biology in general.   
\-I feel kind of misrepresented in how I express myself, because I probably come across as a bohemian looking, probably-straight cis-white-woman. 

\-I feel like I can't express myself differently because of my weight. I'm a quite curvy, very short person, and I just don't like how androgynous clothing looks on my body at the moment. I'm not exactly comfortable wearing dresses either, but that is what I have that fits and is affordable. 

\-I have grown my hair quite long, and although I dislike this, I feel it makes my face look more presentable and attractive because of my weight gain.

\-I tend to not wear make-up most of the time, but when I do, this is again one of the few ways I can feel attractive that is easily in my control.

\-I feel my interests tend to be in (typically) man-dominated areas. I'm into computer programming, games and game dev, science, philosophy, activism, and some other things. I feel less respected quite often in these circles because I present as a woman and because of the connotations around what that means. 

\-Throughout my life, I felt that my intellect was most respected and visible to others when I was thin and presented as more androgynous. 

\-I have struggled with severe ill mental health issues since puberty, and how others treat and perceive me has undoubtedly plays a role in this - I'm just not entirely sure how. 

\-Before weight was an issue, I have had some more typically feminine interests in things like acro/gymnastics/poll dancing, though I have an aversion to how looking like a woman influences how people perceive me and interact with me in these sports. (I.e, I want to be seen as strong, flexible, and self-disciplined rather than small, bendy, throw-able, and often sexualised.) 

\-When online, I take comfort in being able to refer to myself with gender neutral pronouns and not be assumed to be a woman. Although, because of my interests, people generally assume I am a man anyway and this also makes me uncomfortable.

\-Since engaging with feminist activism and philosophy, this has changed the way I think about myself and of femininity. Nonetheless, I'm not sure whether the best route to take for alleviating my feelings of not fitting the ""feminine"" side of the binary is to express in a more androgynous way or to work on empowering myself as a woman.

I\'m not exactly comfortable wearing dresses either, but that is what I have that fits and is affordable. \n\n\\-I have grown my hair quite long, and although I dislike this, I feel it makes my face look more presentable and attractive because of my weight gain.\n\n\\-I tend to not wear make-up most of the time, but when I do, this is again one of the few ways I can feel attractive that is easily in my control.\n\n\\-I feel my interests tend to be in (typically) man-dominated areas. I\'m into computer programming, games and game dev, science, philosophy, activism, and some other things. I feel less respected quite often in these circles because I present as a woman and because of the connotations around what that means. \n\n\\-Throughout my life, I felt that my intellect was most respected and visible to others when I was thin and presented as more androgynous. \n\n\\-I have struggled with severe ill mental health issues since puberty, and how others treat and perceive me has undoubtedly plays a role in this - I\'m just not entirely sure how. \n\n\\-Before weight was an issue, I have had some more typically feminine interests in things like acro/gymnastics/poll dancing, though I have an aversion to how looking like a woman influences how people perceive me and interact with me in these sports. (I.e, I want to be seen as strong, flexible, and self-disciplined rather than small, bendy, throw-able, and often sexualised.) \n\n\\-When online, I take comfort in being able to refer to myself with gender neutral pronouns and not be assumed to be a woman. Although, because of my interests, people generally assume I am a man anyway and this also makes me uncomfortable.\n\n\\-Since engaging with feminist activism and philosophy, this has changed the way I think about myself and of femininity. Nonetheless, I\'m not sure whether the best route to take for alleviating my feelings of not fitting the ""feminine"" side of the binary is to express in a more androgynous way or to work on empowering myself as a woman.   \n\n\n  \nVery open to hearing your experiences, interpretations, advice, or any other guidance you might have to help me understand myself more. &lt;3', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Confused, is this gender dysphoria or self-directed internalised misogyny?

When I was in primary school, I wanted to be a boy and I would tell people I wanted to get a sex change when I got older. My first primary didn't allow the girls to wear trousers/shorts and I was excluded from playing football because I was a girl but I always played other games with male friends. During this time I did have a girly, pink phase but it didn't last long and I started to watch boys shows and desired natural strength like boys had. When I switched school, I wore trousers/shorts and got to play football with mainly boys but I did get female friends. I wore boy's clothing outside of school too.

In highschool, I switched between trousers and skirts. However I wanted short, messy, boyish hair so I got it cut but it looked horrible and flat, it's a small thing but it really made me upset because I didn't feel boyish at all so I ended up growing it long on one side (shaved on the other side). After growing it I accepted being female and wore female clothing, I never spoke or thought much about becoming a male for a long while until college.

At college I experimented a couple times by dressing up like a guy and putting my hair up under a hat to make it look like I had short hair. I wasn't sure how I felt about it, I felt off in some way. I only like guys, I can't imagine being with women but I feel like I'm caught in the middle. I like women's clothes and having my hair long on one side but I want to look and feel stronger, have more muscles (I've started exercising). I also hate my genitals because of all the discomfort and pain they bring me, I've never liked it and I would rather have male genitals, I get jealous of my boyfriend for having them.

I want male genitals and to have more muscle mass but I don't think I want it enough to go through surgery.

2018-07-26 19:50:25,925jlz,9,9,"(posted this in asktransgender, but figured it wouldn't hurt to post it here, too)

Hi! AFAB here, age 15 (soon to be 16, *woot woot*). Recently, I've been having a lot of thoughts about transgenderism, and how it relates to me.

Ever since I can remember, I've always *WONDERED* what it's like to be a boy. I chalked it up to being curious, as every girl must be. The farthest memory I have of this is being about 3 or 4 and trying to picture my room if I'd gotten rid of all my tiaras, girly beanie babies, etc and replaced it with boys' toys--imagining if I was a boy. But, this didn't really stick and didn't seem too significant at the time. I grew up being okay with being female. I identified as female.

But, when I found out about sex, I didn't want to have a penis go into my vagina. I wanted to be the one with the penis. I wanted to play that part. These thoughts have always kind of been there but I haven't really made a big deal about them. I remember at one point, though, later in my adolescence, pretending that I had a penis really excited me. But, once again, I kind of just let these thoughts go.

Since about age 10, I've been interested in FTM transgender individuals, and really admired their transitions. I kind of envied them, at times. I, verily, gave the idea a bit of thought, but more or less without myself in the equation. I imagined what it would be like to be transgender, but more about being male in general. The strong jawline, the shoulders, the beard, the hair, the voice, the way they dress...their penises. It was less about wanting to be with one than it was about BEING one. But not me, I was sure. Not in this lifetime. The thoughts, as always, drifted to the back of my head and stayed there, out of the spotlight for a long time.

When I was about 13-14, I went through a process of trying to define my sexuality (after a LONG, ugly, depressing internal battle, I rested upon queer, knowing that I like women and men, but how much of either often changes). For awhile, I was primarily attracted to women. But, when paying mind to queer media, for some reason, I always identified more with gay men (stick with me here). While identifying as a female, a relationship with a male doesn't seem very desirable to me. I don't really like that dynamic. But, when I imagine being with a male AS a male, it just feels so...right. I get these really strong butterflies when I see two men together, almost as if I'M the one experiencing this. This is sort of silly, but at one point, I was really sad that I wasn't born as a man because I would never be able to have this sort of relationship. It was the point where I figured in some other life, I would be born a boy so I could happily be with one. As female, I'm currently with a female, but I'm beginning to question if this is really fulfilling for me--if it's what I want. I know that even if I remain a female, I will always wish that I was a man that was with a man. Is that weird????

AND FINALLY, now. How am I fairing now? Well, a few weeks ago, whilst on vacation, I watched this movie called ""God's Own Country,"" which is about a male v. male relationship. I literally felt so connected to this dynamic, to the beingness of these two cis-gendered men, that it literally frightened me a little bit. Almost if this is the narrative I'm supposed to be living, but am not because I stupidly imagined that I'll just have to be female until I die and become a man in some hypothetical reincarnation lol. I started wondering if it's possible that I might be...transgender. A strange inquisition for me. It felt funny, weird, but very exciting to ponder this about...myself? Yes, me. What if I, a troubled 15 year-old, might be transgender? YIPES idk.

Ever since I've done more reading about it, finally applying it to myself, the idea has absolutely psyched me up. The idea of being a boy is so thrilling and exciting and...*right*. But, I don't, and haven't really ever, struggled with strong dysphoria. Little bits here and there, sure, but never to the point where I HATED being female. Actually, I've never hated the fact that I am, biologically, female. It still doesn't really BOTHER me, it's just more or less something I wish I just wasn't. But, if I was never able to transition, I think I would be okay, just probably really bummed and I would most likely just fantasize about it. Does this mean I might just be projecting this fantasy onto past experiences that create this FTM narrative? I haven't ever explicitly thought I was a boy trapped in a girl's body until recently. But even now, I don't feel super suffocated or whatever. I just feel like I would RATHER be a boy, but if I HAD to be a girl, I would be okay. (Sorry for the repetitiveness, I'm a bit jumbled atm). Am I trans? Will this pass? I don't want it to, but will it? Is this normal? Am I just creating this? Please help.

AFAB here, age 15 (soon to be 16, *woot woot*). Recently, I\'ve been having a lot of thoughts about transgenderism, and how it relates to me.\n\nEver since I can remember, I\'ve always *WONDERED* what it\'s like to be a boy. I chalked it up to being curious, as every girl must be. The farthest memory I have of this is being about 3 or 4 and trying to picture my room if I\'d gotten rid of all my tiaras, girly beanie babies, etc and replaced it with boys\' toys--imagining if I was a boy. But, this didn\'t really stick and didn\'t seem too significant at the time. I grew up being okay with being female. I identified as female.\n\nBut, when I found out about sex, I didn\'t want to have a penis go into my vagina. I wanted to be the one with the penis. I wanted to play that part. These thoughts have always kind of been there but I haven\'t really made a big deal about them. I remember at one point, though, later in my adolescence, pretending that I had a penis really excited me. But, once again, I kind of just let these thoughts go.\n\nSince about age 10, I\'ve been interested in FTM transgender individuals, and really admired their transitions. I kind of envied them, at times. I, verily, gave the idea a bit of thought, but more or less without myself in the equation. I imagined what it would be like to be transgender, but more about being male in general. The strong jawline, the shoulders, the beard, the hair, the voice, the way they dress...their penises. It was less about wanting to be with one than it was about BEING one. But not me, I was sure. Not in this lifetime. The thoughts, as always, drifted to the back of my head and stayed there, out of the spotlight for a long time.\n\nWhen I was about 13-14, I went through a process of trying to define my sexuality (after a LONG, ugly, depressing internal battle, I rested upon queer, knowing that I like women and men, but how much of either often changes).

I felt a lot of guilt and shame for what I did and when my girlfriend at the time broke up with me I literally had a breakdown over the span of a year. Two suicide attempts one of which I actually died for a few minutes. High anxiety and a cocktail of medications. I've always considered myself straight and I am genuinely interested in woman but also am attracted to feminine transgender woman as well. I have never been one to judge other's be it sexuality religion or skin colour. I came on this site to see if anyone has been in a similar situation at all? And if anyone has some advice on the matter? I recently met a girl that I really like and I hope I haven't stuffed thing's up. I'm a overthinker and my own worst critic self esteem is really low and I find myself doing things I wouldn't normally do such as looking for transgender escorts online. In saying that I haven't done that in the past before ever. And I don't condone the industry at all. I've tried multiple times to quit pornography as I feel it's subjecting to all woman transgender or not. I feel low down highly anxious and depressed. I would just like to get better and try to find someone who is understanding and non judgemental. I fear that if I told this to the girl I like she'll think I'm a freak in some way.

Despite this, however, I do wish to change my name in the future once I do start transitioning. I don't actually hate when people call me that name, but I do feel great happiness when my friends always call me by my female name.

My partner is MtF (no surgery), I am cis AFAB.
For the first year of our relationship we could have sex, she would occasionally have dysphoria really bad and we would stop but for the most part she would be more into it than i was (i consider myself a strange grey area of asexual, also have a health issue that causes me extreme pain during sex) and i felt awful. My lack of sex drive due to my issues used to be a huge problem to her, to the extent that it almost caused us big problems.
We got over those issues and were doing well for a while;
but now, we haven't been able to have sex in weeks because she hasn't been able to keep herself into it, which i more than understand in my own ways so i dont hold it against her or hate her for it...im just curious as to if other trans folk have experienced this.
She can masturbate with no problem, she even watches straight cis porn to do so, but when it comes to actual SEX she can't handle it anymore.
Is this something a lot of trans folk struggle with?
I've discussed already with her and she assures me it isn't me, that she still 100% is in love with and attracted to me. She initiates half of the time and we still have to stop because even when she REALLY wants it, she can't do it.
We are thinking it could be her hormones (she recently started progesterone and is about to hit her 2 year mark for estrogen and t blockers).
Regardless, is there anything anyone can recommend that I could try to maybe make things easier for, or better for her? She isn't good at communicating and when i ask her that i always get ""i dont know"" so honestly, i'm asking because BOTH of us would like suggestions.
Things we could try, things that might have helped others who have experienced this, etc.
*
I know everyone is different but any suggestions, or even fellow trans folk reassuring her in the comments that this is a completely normal thing would be appreciated. She feels terrible every time and it puts her into this funk of insisting there is something wrong with her and that she's broken, and hearing otherwise from me only goes so far sometimes.

So this week I was on vacation from work and heading down to visit my Mom and head to the coast for the week.  I headed down to her place, and I noticed right away she seemed like she was confrontational right off the bat.

In the past she has been really supportive and invited me out as my new self a few different times,  never once did she say anything about any doubts/issues with my transition.

I brought some liquor (shes always had a drinking issue/hobby) she got kinda lit and was asking about my recent name change that I got done in court.  I updated my name and gender (Fuck yessss!) Ive been out everywhere for over a year now, and everyone uses my new name except her and my dad :(

She was upset and I told her its all so I can get my new ID. I have to still go get my social security and birth certificate updated.  That was the point she lost her stuff.  Started yelling about how I never thought about her in this whole process, and how could I want to update my birth certificate, that is totally wrong, because that is not who I am.

She screamed for hours, I just sat there in shock that she was so fully losing her crap, I called a cab and now I am staying at a hotel. What an amazing start to a vacation!

Ugh I think Ive lost 2 parents over this.  Why is this shit so hard?!?   ",trans,Mom went from Ally to Screaming enemy?
