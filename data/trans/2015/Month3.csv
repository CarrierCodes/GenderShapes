2015-03-07 18:02:54,2y9bc4,10,6,"Hi r/trans!

I recently started a job as a barista at a cafe/bakery in Los Angeles County, and will address customers as ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" if I am ringing them up or if I need to catch their attention regarding their order. 

Sometimes I will encounter trans customers and there are moments I am unsure if I'm using the correct pronouns. 

With transwomen, I feel like it is easier to use the correct female pronoun since they tend to present themselves very feminine. 

With transmen and masculine-looking women, I find it a bit more confusing because I am afraid to use a female pronoun on a transman, or a male pronoun for someone who identifies as female. I myself am a woman who leans toward androgynous presentation, so being called ""he"" would make me feel pretty giddy on the inside, but of course that isn't the case for everyone.

Dropping pronouns for all customers seems like the easiest way to combat the problem, but it also doesn't feel very polite. 

Any thoughts? Am I getting worried over nothing? I want the customer to have a pleasant experience at our store, and I don't want accidental misgendering to end up dampening someone's mood.

I thought I knew what being trans meant but it's become very clear very quickly that I have no idea where to start. Telling me was a big step for him and I don't think he's ready to really discuss it yet. I've done some research and reading about it but it hasn't really given any insight as to the mindset or what he personally is going through, and I want to know more to support him as best I can. 


I know this is separate from his sexual orientation - he still likes girls etc. but he just desires to be one? So effectively with a lesbian girl? He mentioned something about always not being sure of himself or feeling complete because he has been suppressing and as much as I am trying to empathise it's just not happening; I just don't get it. He was quite vague so if anyone could explain better what he is thinking or going through that would be immensely helpful. I saw a couple yahoo posts where people were making statements such as ""your boyfriend never actually existed"" and whatnot and I'm not sure if that's what's happening here; because because regardless of any change wouldn't he still retain his personality??? 

Am I essentially dating a female? He's been going to the gym and been trying to get ripped and all that, he has a load of what are traditionally considered to be 'male' traits so it's very hard when I try to reconcile what I already know about him with the fact that he sees himself as female.  He isn't that fussed about the physical side, but more of the identity crisis thing if that makes sense.

TL;DR SO (MtF?) came out as trans; I just want to understand what he's going through or thinking from a more personal perspective.

This past summer(2014), I was living with some people who turned out to only have offered to let me move in because they have a fetish for transgender women. A few months into living there, my sister got in touch with me, and offered to let me move in with her. At the time, she was unaware that I'm Transgender. At this point, I was almost a month living full time, preparing to see a therapist/psychiatrist about starting HRT so I can start to transition in more than just how I dress. I came out to my sister, and she told me she was fine with it, but that I couldn't transition while I was living with her and her family. 

Out of desperation to get away from the people I was living with, I accepted her stipulations and made the move. For about a month, it didn't really both me. Possibly because I was more excited to get to see my niece and nephews every day, and spend time with them. As far as I'm aware, her husband and the kids aren't aware that I'm trans. 

I've gotten to a point where I can't stand presenting as a male, and being restricted in what I can and cannot wear(dresses, skirts, flats, etc.). She pesters me to cut my hair, but I just outright tell her no. I Cut it when I moved in to appease her, but I've begun growing it back out, and refuse to cut it again.

Here's where I need help; 
I want to move out of here, and somewhere that's more transgender, and overall LGBT, accepting. I currently live in Indiana, and a lot of you have heard of the new law/bill/piece of crap that just got passed. That made me feel even less comfortable living here.

I'm in the planning phase currently, so I can figure up how much money I need to save up, what city I want to move to, etc. I Want to make sure that wherever I move, is a safe environment for me where I can transition safely and happily, and more or less start over.

I'm a married lesbian and have been very masculine presenting for the vast majority of my life. My wife is incredibly supportive and isn't really surprised by this.

I kind of am. Honestly I feel less legitimate because it's not like I hate/hated being a woman. Feminism has helped me really love myself and my body and I was content with that until this recent questioning within the last year or so.  I would say that starting to seriously lift weights, I realized I'm never going to achieve the physique I truly want - big pecs, no breasts, broad shoulders, a gnarly beard. Growing up I always saw myself as a boy, and even now I still have to sort of like, remind myself that my body looks more like the women than the men on the cover of Men's Fitness right now. And that bothers me. I have done drag with a full on beard and I LOVED being a man for the few hours I've done so. I know it's not the same, I'm just talking about the feeling I got in fooling myself that I was a man and how good it felt.

I guess I feel somewhat selfish because I know it's a lot to place on my wife and family. I don't really feel that anxiety or disgust with my genitals the way some people do. On the one hand I kind of feel like I could continue to live as a woman, but on the other I really feel a deep longing for being able to shave my face and grow a beard. I know I need to stop comparing my own situation with others to ""legitimize"" my feelings as a gender questioning, possibly transman. Also we are trying for a baby and I just am facepalming the shit out of myself for this incredibly weird timing. I mean, I never really had a strong suspicion that I might be trans until recently. I feel like a fraud for it being less of a build-up the way it can be for others. Also a teammate started transitioning and seeing how happy he is, I just saw him and thought ""holy shit that's what I want."" 

When I think about the implications of all this, it dizzies me. I have literally no clue what the future holds for me and my body. Will I transition? Will I take testosterone? The idea of having top surgery excites me like you wouldn't believe. But I have a real fear of the unknown. There are so many resources available to me, and it's so much that I almost don't even want to begin.

I feel lost. I just don't know where to even start. The good thing is that my wife and my mom both know I'm questioning. My wife is taking it amazingly well. But I'm nervous that a possible transition would wreak havoc on our marriage. She's a lot less nervous than I am. I just don't want to risk any inkling of not being with her.

When I told my mom at first she took it kind of not so well, but then within the same conversation was/is very supportive. I think she doesn't really understand. She weirdly is more okay with my becoming a man than with my current state of neither. I think she just wants to be able to place me in a box she understands and I'm not in any box at all. But I know she'll love me no matter what, she's been 100% supportive of my being a lesbian and when I admitted I was questioning she said it makes sense and that she's always felt at heart I was a boy. But I think that's her naive way of misunderstanding masculinity among butch women as trans and it's hard to make her understand the difference. 

Lastly, I do feel sad at the idea of leaving womanhood behind. It's not like I ever was super feminine at all, but...it scares me to think how some of my best girl friends will think of me as not one of them anymore. I play for a women's rugby team and I'm sad to either give that up or eventually having to play with men...ouch!

Anyway, I came here to let this off my chest. Thanks for listening. I just am curious if there's anyone else who started in the same way?",trans,"Oh boy, here I go.
