I'm 19 years old right now, FAAB, but I always knew something was different about me. I could probably ramble on about the different phases I went through up until now, of being confused about myself and thinking my masculine affinities were just tomboyish hobbies...

It was as if a puzzle piece fell into place, and I realized why I connected with the trans* population as heavily as I did.

I'm also quite fearful of passing and coming out in the future heh, as I'm sure most folks are. I've but a tiny yet curvy 5'4"" frame lol... And I have NO idea how to come out to my friends. I'm supposed to move in with two of them this Summer, so I can only hope they'd be accepting of me.

Another issue is that I can't afford to take any sorts of transitioning steps on my own, even if it means buying new clothes.

2015-02-05 04:25:55,2uu6fr,17,25,"I'm writing this post to get something off of my chest that's been a psychological burden for over 20 years.

First, a quick biography. I am, and have always been biologically, socially and instinctually male. I'm into ""boy"" things like technology, programming and gaming. I wear ""boy"" clothes. I'm not gay, I like girls wear a goatee... You get the idea, pretty basic Western Society Male™. I'm posting this anonymously because, for all intents and purposes, that's how things are going to remain.

But this would be a pretty dumb thing to post if there wasn't a hook, so, here it is: I've come to the conclusion that I suffer from Gender Dysphoria. There, I said it. It is, and has been (at least subconsciously,) for as long as it matters, my belief that I should have been born a girl.

I've always hated the fact that I'm a male, though I didn't always know it so specifically. For a long time, I thought I hated that I was human at all. Over time I was able to realise that this view was over-broad as, as a male, I only have the one perspective to go on.

At first the signs of my disphoria were slight, and easy to miss. Things like enjoying the times I could gender swap the stuffed animal character I played with my sister, or playing the girl character with friends, or ""Man... wouldn't it be simply BEST to have Ranma's curse..."".

As I progressed through puberty, I began to figure out what these things meant. I Wished I was a girl. It made sense to me then. But I kept it to myself. After all, I wasn't into boys and I didn't want to send that signal and it wasn't like I could DO anything about it. But did I ever wish... Birthday's, shooting stars, long tunnels with held breath... any excuse. I fantasised with friends about becoming genetic microbiologists and inventing clever new ways to cause mutations. He wanted wings. I wanted to change my Y to an X. Then came the video games. My created or selected characters, almost always the women and girls. Occasionally someone would ask why, and I'd trot out the party line ""If you're gonna stare at a characters ass all day... heh heh"" but inside, I knew the reason. It was a projection. A projection of what I wished I could be.

On more than one occasion I allowed my roleplayed woman characters to bleed out of the games. Pretending that there was, in fact, a woman on the other side, my side, of the monitor. More than once did that virtual relationship go beyond platonic. Only once was I discovered. The damage caused by the shattering of that illusion sours my ability to role play to this very day.

The years rolled on. I got married and had some kids, a career, friends... Yet none of them knows of the secret Me on the inside. How could they? This secret me is a person even I myself cannot accept. I admire trans/non-binary people. I admire their ability to accept and adopt their psychological gender in spite of the biological gender that was rolled for them. I admire the courage needed to publicly transition, and the strength to live with it. For I do not have these traits. How can I identify as a thing that I am not? I am not a woman. I've never been a woman. I have not, and can never fully experience life as a woman. And I hate myself for it.

I hate my male genitals.
I hate my male frame.
I hate the clothes I'm ""allowed"" to wear.
And most importantly, I hate that this is the prison that I'm forced to live in for my whole life.

To be honest I’m glad that she cope it relatively well. Even when all the questions are understandable, they are on the other hand very difficult to answer. Sometimes I have the feeling to be dissected like an experiment.

&gt; How many guys did you already had? 

*several.*

&gt; In our relationship? 

*no, before.*

&gt; Do you prefer one side more? 

*I prefer your side :) but somethimes I need the male world, the glamour, glitter, rainbows and unicorns.*

… and then there are questions I can not answer like:

&gt; How often do you want to “go out”? 

At the moment daily but I can not tell you in real life because it would break your heart so I say something like: 

*You tell me how often it is ok for you?* 
&gt; “Once every two weeks” 

and my stomach cringes.

&gt; Is it a phase? 

*It is some kind of a repeating phase.*

I’m 39 years old. Always been courious since 17. Grown up in the outback with financial problems my whole life. Some gays have committed suicide in my area becouse of bullying. I have no desire to hide anymore or to trick my fiancee. We are together since 1,5 years. I love her very much and love the sex we have. but I didn’t know until two months ago how much I miss this other life. I don’t like parking places and toilets, cheating on my fiance with guys that look like shit. This girl have some class. :) 

My fiancee has entrusted to a friend this topic, hoping to find some answers. A guy she's been once talking by e-mail and is actually in a relationship. He explained her that she must have understanding and that it is a part of me. bla bla bla aso... seemed pretty fine. 

The next day he has hit on her whether she would not like to have a real man. I could break this mother$%&amp;§ twice his nose. -.-

......................................................

So one week is over. We've been talking much I was once out ... on a monday. It was soooo boring because no one was in the two clubs where I've been. So I started to make [selfies](http://i.imgur.com/8Koi0Zu.jpg). ^ ^ It was one of the happiest days in my life. 

Before my coming out I was searching and storing transsexual porn. 
Now it's shoes and makeup.

My fiancee and I figured many points out. 

*I love my genitalia. No, I'm not gonna grow myself a pair of tits. ... not now :) Yes, I still want to marry you and I love you very much. I'm between two worlds and I feel great there* She understands that at the moment I want to live it out and go out more often. ... she made my eyebrows and bought my some cheap eyeshadow. :) ... clever girl... now she wants my expesive powder and lipliner.

2015-02-08 07:27:15,2v6ae1,2,4,"[To start, I am very sorry for the incredibly long post-- there is a tl;dr at the bottom]

I am not sure if this is the right sub to post on,  but if it isn't some kind of redirection would be greatly appreciated.

Hi there, I am a straight cisfemale, and am dating a person who is biologically male and views himself (herself?) as a woman. We have been together for a little over a year now, and they recently told me about how they feel in that regard (though I had some suspicions about it before).  

Now I am pretty new to all of this and I want to be supportive, but I am a straight woman, and not physically attracted to women at all. Obviously the personality of a person is the most important thing in a relationship, but you can't discount someone's physical appearance. If my SO were to change his* appearance to look more feminine, I don't know how I would feel about that. I am very attracted to him* as he* is now, and I am not sure the feeling would stay if he* does decide to become more feminine.

I told them that they should see some kind of counselor for a number of reasons, however aside from it being expensive, a major excuse for not going is that they are feeling overwhelmed with work, school, and have no time for themselves (which is all the more reason to go to some kind of counselor. I know they are depressed, and I honestly am not qualified to give any kind of advice. Plus I'd rather they learn some kind of ""coping"" mechanism from said counselor).

As an aside, the more he* thinks about change, the more ""aggravated"" he* becomes (for lack of a better word). Though it might not be on purpose, he* has snapped at me before for little things (driving too cautiously, inviting him* on errands then getting upset that he accepted the invitation to do errands when he* has so little free time. Just a lot of little things that if they happened once every so often, it wouldn't matter, but they do build up over time, especially as the frequency increases). And when he* realizes what he's* done, he* apologizes and insists he* doesn't mean to be so hurtful. It's rough, because I feel like I go out of my way to do so many nice things for him*, and that is the response I get. It is shitty getting jerked around like that.

Our relationship is already a little rocky as it is, and though I do love him* it is becoming harder and harder for me to find reasons to stay together (especially due to the above). I really do try to be understanding and helpful and someone he* can lean on. But he* doesn't tell me why he* is upset, hell, he* hardly tells me why his* day at work was shitty. It is so hard to be caring if he* doesn't let me in. 

I know that if my SO does decide to go take the plunge and go through with being a transperson, unfortunately it is highly likely that they will be disowned by their family.

I don't want to be a factor in weather or not he* physically changes himself* . I want him* to be happy with who he* is (but if that does happen, I don't know if I can be with him* . I want him* to find someone who 100% loves and supports him* for who he, or she, is). My SO has told me that I am a large factor in decision making, and I don't want that to be the case. 

The way I see it is that my SO really has three options: 

1. Go to counseling and get many things mentally ironed out. 

1. Don't go through with anything (or don't even try) and be unhappy. 

1. Go through with it and possibly lose me. (I do want to be supportive of him/her, but I don't know if I could stay with someone I wasn't physically attracted to. I think they are a wonderful person, but honestly I don't know if I am strong enough to do it.)

_______________

**Started using he pronoun, as that is what he currently goes with. Plus they/their is hard to keep track of.
_______________

**TL;DR: It took my SO so long to come out to me because they didn't know how I'd act. and honestly I still don't really know what to think. I have told them that they should go to some sort of councilor to talk about how they are feeling (because like many people in the LGBTQ community, my SO is also depressed) and is accidentally taking out their aggravation on me.**

2015-02-10 04:12:20,2vds44,7,3,"Throwaway account here.  But this question has been on my mind for a few weeks now and I was hoping someone far more informed than I am could answer it.

I assume most people here are pretty against the idea of gender roles:  Men gotta be stone cold, emotionless car repairmen and women have to be more submissive, prettied-up sandwich makers.  These roles and assumptions about people based on their sex is harmful, wrong, and toxic for reasons obvious enough not to be explained in this text post.

Where this comes into play with transsexualism is my question.  If, for example, I was born male, but I love feeling pretty, find being submissive more suiting to my personality and am sexually attracted to other males, I may feel like I am a woman trapped in a man's body and may consider transitioning.

My question is:  Is this perpetuating gender roles?  Should we look at a flamboyant, submissive, gay male as someone who is a ""woman"" because those are ""women things""?  Are designating these traits as those of a specific gender encouraging the roles many of us despise?  Why can't we accept that a male may very well be submissive, pretty and attracted to males?  Is this a result of gender roles and transitioning that male into a women trying to get him to fit our binary criteria of how we see the sexes?

I truly hope this question does not offend anybody.  That was not at all my intention.  I am a person who's never once questioned their gender or sexuality, and I don't personally know anyone who considers themselves trans.

I'm doing my thesis for my master's in public health on gender nonbinary people's experiences in the health care system (because the medical/health system is super binary, and there is little to no research on how that affects nonbinary people), and I've got an online survey that needs responses! If you're someone who is not a man or a woman and you've ever wanted to rant or rave about your health care experiences, this is your time to shine! If you know some nonbinary people who might be interested, please share this with them!

IN PARTICULAR, given the responses I've gotten so far, I really really need responses from nonbinary people who are people of color and/or designated male at birth (DMAB).

The survey is an online, mostly open-ended/qualitative survey, so most of the questions allow you to type as much as you want. Think of it as an online, typed interview.

What do you get out of doing this? Primarily, the chance to ultimately share your experience in the healthcare system with healthcare providers, policymakers and researchers, and hopefully affect the way that they think about the gender binary in healthcare. Secondarily, you get my undying love for helping me finish my thesis. Also, you have the chance to enter a lottery to win one of 2 $50 giftcards to amazon.com (I really wish that I could pay everyone who took the survey, but unfortunately I don't have the funding for that).

Who can take the survey? Anyone who is 18 or over, a US resident, and identifies as somehow outside of the man/woman binary. Again, I particularly need respondents who are people of color and/or designated male at birth.

Here is the survey link, feel free to share it far and wide! https://yalesurvey.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_en58ujewB485VKB Thank you all so much!

If you know some nonbinary people who might be interested, please share this with them!\n\nIN PARTICULAR, given the responses I've gotten so far, I really really need responses from nonbinary people who are people of color and/or designated male at birth (DMAB).\n\nThe survey is an online, mostly open-ended/qualitative survey, so most of the questions allow you to type as much as you want. Think of it as an online, typed interview.\n\nWhat do you get out of doing this? Primarily, the chance to ultimately share your experience in the healthcare system with healthcare providers, policymakers and researchers, and hopefully affect the way that they think about the gender binary in healthcare. Secondarily, you get my undying love for helping me finish my thesis. Also, you have the chance to enter a lottery to win one of 2 $50 giftcards to amazon.com (I really wish that I could pay everyone who took the survey, but unfortunately I don't have the funding for that).\n\nWho can take the survey? Anyone who is 18 or over, a US resident, and identifies as somehow outside of the man/woman binary. Again, I particularly need respondents who are people of color and/or designated male at birth.\n\nHere is the survey link, feel free to share it far and wide! https://yalesurvey.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_en58ujewB485VKB Thank you all so much!

2015-02-16 23:39:37,2w4s6c,3,2,"Hello, I am 19 years old probably MtF transgender. My problem lies in rather silly and maybe even unimportant detail, but it kinda eats my confidence away.

First of all, I am going to give you as short version of my story as possible, but it is still sensitive matter to me and I easily wander of the purpose to express my feelings, so I am sorry, if I start to ramble non sense.

Here we go:
I have now suffered 8 years of depression and I have finally suppressed it at least to levels where it only has minor effects to my daily basis life. I had multiple suicide attempts along the way, but as I loved my family way too much, I always pussied out of guaranteed plans, like jumping off building or shooting myself. I only took toxins and pills, but they didn't prove to be fatal in the amounts I took them and to my parents I just seemed sick.

I lived 6 years without anyone noticing my depression nor my suicidal behavior. Until once I had made a cocktail, which would certainly take me out, but then I end up crying in my mom's arms as I felt like that they deserved a chance to try to help me, since they also loved me. I couldn't speak to hear a word, but she understood somehow and there started my process towards salvation. 

In the beginning I couldn't even tell the therapist that I wasn't okay, but obviously we both knew that was a filthy lie and we kept meeting these awkward meetings for a month until I was able to crack my armor an tell her something. 

Through out the 2,5 years I have attended the therapy with multiple therapists unfortunately. I have opened up and I have gain clarity of my own actions and who I am. Those 8 years I had not lived as I wanted. I had taken this notion that I need to live for others and their set goals as mine were not important and non-achievable . I had been following same things same goals for 8 years, without once considering, if I liked these they were just things which made everyone around me happy and proud. This obviously was exhausting and it was probably reason why I run out of juice in 6 years.

Those 8 years I had suppressed my feeling completely and I had forgotten my dream, the cause of all this. It was on 5th grade when I realized that I would love to be girl. I judged it as a silly dream and I didn't give it much time to develop as I only seem to receive negative feedback from my peers and media around that time. Not that I directly ever approached anyone with my dream.
It also wasn't such a big deal since I never really pursuit my own dreams and more just went along others, as I was shy and emphatic and understanding.

I made a promise that, if my family died one day or everyone would disappear I would pursue it. There on forward I started to walk in the armor whose purpose was to make others happy. I somehow was able to erase the memory of that moment and my dream until I remembered last Christmas after really dark chapter in my healing process. It wasn't that the person was forgotten completely I still did things and actions which were more geared towards girls and enjoyed them and I felt a bit outcast among my male friends for no apparent reason, but I couldn't connect these to being girl or wanting to be a girl and I also heavily over expressed my manliness to suppress the real me, I guess, since I didn't really get anything out of it.

It took me almost an year to accept and come terms with it. Mostly since I didn't even have anyone to discuss it with, since my therapist had just switched. I have now talked with my therapist and we have good relationship now and we decided to apply to treatment as it works a bit weird in Finland.


The problem that I face now is that, since these 8 years have made my personality quite washed out to be honest, I feel like blank page, with few words on it. I do not really get this sensation that I am girl, but more like I want to be girl and with that comes notion that can I ever look or act like a girl, if I only want to be girl, but thinking my background would this be normal as I do not really know anything even about myself. All I know that my favorite color is teal and I love cooking.

Although there is alot ""proof"" of transgender-ism in my past, but I do not remember these moments in my head, so I do not know how I perceived myself back then. I used to like more ""girly colored"" cloths like red and light blue, majority of my friends use to be girls and I used to opt. to hang out with them. I had a surgery to my foreskin as it got infected, the only reason it would get infected is that if you do not wash or touch it, which could indicate that I was uncomfortable with my genitalia when I was little also, first time I touch myself was somewhere in 6th-7th grade. I also never really felt comfortable with my body was I fat or in shape what so ever.  This all was before I got depressed and wore my armor to hide everything even from me.

The thing is that all this creates anxiety over the fact that, if no one will believe me, if I can never act like girl or pass a girl even if I managed to obtain the looks. My family won't be taking me with open arms and I know that for fact.



So the question is that. What do you think of my situation and do you think I am or I could be transgender still, even if I do not really identify as a girl that much, especially around the peers around me since I feel like I can't throw away the act, but more want to be girl and be treated as a girl.
