2015-04-03 02:30:13,319md0,1,1,"Over spring break, my field tectonics class had a long field trip out to Death Valley. During the technology-free nights, I had a lot of time to think about my gender identity. I've identified as genderqueer for the last few years, but I've come around to identifying as transfeminine now. For two reasons. Firstly, I realized that I always identify as female when I can ""get away with it"". Mainly in internet personas and other text-based media where my appearance and my voice doesn't have any bearing. Secondly, I'm pretty sure the only reason I identified as genderqueer was because my university's GLBTQ community is pretty shitty.

Somewhere along the line I got it in my head that I'm not allowed to be a girl, because I have a male body and male genitals and male bone structure and facial features and I'm not in a big rush to change those things given the physical trauma and outrageous expense. I think this is because people at my university are constantly having these more-queer/trans/feminist-than-thou pissing contests and cultivate this atmosphere of ""well if you can still pass as a man you're still enjoying male privilege so you're not really a woman"". Rather than let myself be pressured to change my body physically and chemically in ways I'm not yet comfortable with, I just decided ""I guess I'm genderqueer"". But shit, I've been walking around every day wearing entirely womens clothing (jeans and artsy t-shirts mostly), light makeup, a cute purse, and other decidedly not-stereotypically-masculine accessories for more than a year. It's not my fault I still read to most people as a super feminine gay guy instead of a girl. Other people's opinions of my appearance don't make my gender identity any less legitimate, right?

So I've decided I'm trans...and I don't know what happens next. I'm just about to graduate, and I'm going to have to fall back on pretending to be a cis/het man if I want to have a chance of getting (and keeping) a job. I'm not ready (and maybe I never will be, and that should be okay unless all the rhetoric of the GLTBQ community is really just so many empty words) to start messing with HRT or SRS right now, and I'm okay with that. I'd love to go on Facebook and say ""Hey everyone, I'm trans, she/her/hers now please."", but I've too much to worry about just finishing up my degree to want to deal with the fallout of that right now.

I guess I just want someone to tell me that it's okay for me to be trans, and that it's okay for me to identify as a girl even if I probably won't ""pass"" as female any time in the near future.

And this is an awful translation made by me: 


&gt; **For the first time, they give full adoption of two boys to a trans Mom**

&gt; *The process began a decade ago in Córdoba; The children suffered abuse from their biological parents*

&gt; The civil judge from Rio Cuarto, Fernanda Betancourt, granted the full adoption of two children to a transsexual, Maria Belen Ochoa. The mother's condition (Note:  not sure if it is the right way to say in English, and in fact I'm not sure it was proper in spanish either), make it a case study in the country.

&gt; Ochoa began the process a decade ago when he won temporary guardianship of two children, a one year and three months years old boy and a 16 days old baby girl that were her neighbours. She had a warehouse where the largest used to go and stay with parental consent.

&gt; ""Parents  left them here to guard - she says to LA NACION-  Sometimes  a week passed by until they returned. Until one day, they didn't came, so I went to ask about it and they told me they were sick. As they do not bring them to the doctor, I did it with their permission. ""

&gt; At the consultation the doctor found that the boy had signs of violence, malnutrition, pneumonia and pneumonia. He ordered his hospitalization and reported the case to court. Ochoa took care of him in hospital and asked to be their temporary guardian when the possibility of put the children into the state care started to be considered as an option.

&gt; The custody was awarded until both parents ""changed their life and reorganize"" (they had addiction problems and work issues). Ochoa said they visited them for a while but then they stopped them.

&gt; She decided to move forward with the process to adopt them. It went to trough several stages of custody until in December achieved the full adoption. The court decision was not not spread until now.

&gt; ""Being a transsexual was never an obstacle. The Justice always prioritized the welfare of children,"" he told to La Nacion. Today the little girl is going to fourth grade and the boy to seconday school. She owns a store and a deli.

&gt; They both know the whole story about his mother: ""I never hid  anything from them and never was an inconvenience for their classmates or anyone. They take naturally are well and they are well and happy happy...""


I will be the first to say that Argentina is very far from being an lgbt paradise. There is still lots of discrimination, specially in smaller towns. But when the other day a read a news from 2003: http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/07/04/p-01001.htm, I definitely could see there were some big differences already. Basically, the article says tha in a small city with a population of 13.000 inhabitants (and quite conservative as far as I knew),  a trans woman was elected as town councilwoman (seems to be the translation, but I'm not sure), with more votes than anyone else. Ok, this is not entirely true, she defines herself as a travesty, and not as a trans, but first, you know most people would see any difference between the two, second second, this was more than *eleven freaking years ago*, so yeah, some concepts or way of thinking might have been different at that time. In any case, I was shocked when I read about it. 

I think that kind of culture, eventually helped to achieve this in 2012:

The mother\'s condition (Note:  not sure if it is the right way to say in English, and in fact I\'m not sure it was proper in spanish either), make it a case study in the country.\n\n&gt; Ochoa began the process a decade ago when he won temporary guardianship of two children, a one year and three months years old boy and a 16 days old baby girl that were her neighbours. She had a warehouse where the largest used to go and stay with parental consent.\n\n&gt; ""Parents  left them here to guard - she says to LA NACION-  Sometimes  a week passed by until they returned. Until one day, they didn\'t came, so I went to ask about it and they told me they were sick. As they do not bring them to the doctor, I did it with their permission. ""\n\n&gt; At the consultation the doctor found that the boy had signs of violence, malnutrition, pneumonia and pneumonia. He ordered his hospitalization and reported the case to court. Ochoa took care of him in hospital and asked to be their temporary guardian when the possibility of put the children into the state care started to be considered as an option.\n\n&gt; The custody was awarded until both parents ""changed their life and reorganize"" (they had addiction problems and work issues). Ochoa said they visited them for a while but then they stopped them.\n\n&gt; She decided to move forward with the process to adopt them. It went to trough several stages of custody until in December achieved the full adoption. The court decision was not not spread until now.\n\n&gt; ""Being a transsexual was never an obstacle. The Justice always prioritized the welfare of children,"" he told to La Nacion. Today the little girl is going to fourth grade and the boy to seconday school. She owns a store and a deli.\n\n&gt; They both know the whole story about his mother: ""I never hid  anything from them and never was an inconvenience for their classmates or anyone. They take naturally are well and they are well and happy happy...""\n\n\nI will be the first to say that Argentina is very far from being an lgbt paradise. There is still lots of discrimination, specially in smaller towns. But when the other day a read a news from 2003: http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/07/04/p-01001.htm, I definitely could see there were some big differences already. Basically, the article says tha in a small city with a population of 13.000 inhabitants (and quite conservative as far as I knew),  a trans woman was elected as town councilwoman (seems to be the translation, but I\'m not sure), with more votes than anyone else. Ok, this is not entirely true, she defines herself as a travesty, and not as a trans, but first, you know most people would see any difference between the two, second second, this was more than *eleven freaking years ago*, so yeah, some concepts or way of thinking might have been different at that time. In any case, I was shocked when I read about it. \n\nI think that kind of culture, eventually helped to achieve this in 2012: \n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/argentina-gender-identity-law-takes-effect_n_1570830.html\n\n\nSo, yeah, not bad for a third world country. \n\n', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'There is so much shit going on in my country, but I think at least in this we are one of the most developed countries in the world, surprisingly.

In your view, what would be the effect of the proposed changes on the service?
 
Although the proposed changes are much better than previously, they do not go far enough. Trans people will still regard the NSS as discriminatory and will take legal action against the NHS to remedy that.
 
 
What further changes, if any do you think need to be made to this document?
 
The NSS are still classified as part of mental health specifications. Since it is a relatively simple administrative task to relocate the NSS from mental health, this does not appear to show good intention or good will on the part of the NHS.
 
The inclusion of ‘Psychological and Emotional Well-being’ and ‘Change in Mental Health’ as process indicators is inappropriate. Anyone who is treated successfully for any condition will experience improved psychological and emotional well-being, as a global default position, and the corresponding relief of stress will necessarily improve their mental health. Specifying these items in this context suggests an attempt to psychopathologise by the back door.
 
1.1.1 ‘This will include preparation for relationships, exploration of sexuality’ should read ‘At the request of service users, this may include . . .’ Many service users regard such discussions as prurient, irrelevant, or naïve and certainly, since women having bilateral mastectomy are not automatically subjected to discussions as to whether their surgery has made them reconsider their sexuality, this is a point of direct discrimination.
 
3.2.2 The inclusion of psychiatry is inappropriate and should be replaced with counselling.
 
3.3.1.x It should be the role of the GP to assess service users’ capacity to consent. The lead provider should have no role in this unless it suspects that the service user has lost that capacity to consent, in which case it should refer back to the GP. The current wording appears to comprise a back-door to providers refusing treatment or making it onerous simply because they disagree with the service user’s decision, which breaches the GMC rules on consent.
 
3.4.1.a) ii Psychological therapies ‘must be provided if clinical need is identified’: this is potentially sinister since it is not clear who will make such an identification, on what criteria it will be based, whether patient consent is required, or what the implications of provision are. Again, this might be interpreted as a back-door to lead providers refusing treatment or making it onerous simply because they disagree with the service user’s decision, which breaches the GMC rules on consent.
 
3.4.1.a) v ‘the number of which will be determined by need’ effectively writes a blank cheque for endless treatment, potentially against the service users’ wishes. This is financially irresponsible, quite different from other parts of the NHS where the number of treatment sessions is capped, and once again, might be interpreted as a back-door to lead providers refusing treatment or making it onerous simply because they disagree with the service user’s decision, which breaches the GMC rules on consent.
 
 
Are there any other considerations not reflected in the document that you wish to draw our attention to?
 
It is most important that any psychological therapies are transparent, specified in detail, with clear criteria and processes, and are wholly elective. The major medical inequity that trans people have experienced is the transfer to them, from male homosexuality, of brutal and ineffective psychological therapies. At present, these continue to be mandated by practice in GICs simply because the Interim Specifications leave latitude for that abuse. As the repeated reports of patients confirm, many of these psychological therapies have the character of conversion therapy, setting out to change the mind and behaviour of the client, and operating as a barrier to all other forms of treatment. This is a point of direct discrimination as well as breaching the GMC’s rules on consent.
Nonbinary people are mentioned as eligible for some treatments but not others (Genital surgeries, hair removal).
The NSS requires specialists to look for consistency of identity. Instead, it should recognise explicitly that someone can be ‘consistently’ gender fluid, bigender etc and qualify for treatment.
The NSS should clearly allow different pathways of treatments for nonbinary people – some nonbinary people might need a combination of treatments that might not usually be expected to go together in a binary trans person’s care plan.
The NSS treats nonbinary and non-gendered/agender people as two separate categories with fewer treatments (only ‘gender neutralising’ treatments) recommended for ‘agendered’ people. All trans people should have access to whichever treatments they need regardless of how they identify.
The rules for accessing bilateral mastectomy are different for cis women wanting the procedure as Risk Reducing Surgery compared to those for men and nonbinary people wanting the procedure as gender-related surgery. This is direct discrimination.
Trans people of all genders can be refused hormone treatments by their GP because they aren’t approved for use as part of gender reassignment, while cis people would not be refused the same medications if they went to their GP with low hormone levels. This is direct discrimination. While the NSS is clear that prescribing is outside its remit, to demonstrate joined-up policy-making it should be explicit about the measures the NHS is taking to remedy that discrimination.
The rules regarding consent continue to be routinely breached for trans people, who are mandated by practice to undergo psychiatric assessment. This is direct discrimination.

Click Yes and on the next page, copy and paste:
 
The evidence base for psychiatric involvement is the RC Psych Good Practice Guidelines, and the WPATH Standards of Care, reflecting a ‘revolving door’ culture, in which the self-interested clinicians who wrote the NSS are part of the same networks (and in some cases the same people) as those who wrote the Good Practice Guidelines and who contribute to the conferences, journals, and culture from which WPATH derives. This is very problematic because it means that:
•       The evidence base is disingenuous and is a fabrication, just as it was for male homosexuality.
•       There is no externality to the NSS – it is solipsistic unsupported assertion.
•       Psychiatric involvement in this area of medicine is effectively unregulated and unevidenced.
Treatments for nonbinary people are described as more of a “complex clinical judgment” involving a greater number of gender specialists – this is discriminatory in comparison with treatment for binary people.
Access to treatment for all trans people should be based on informed consent and not implied gatekeeping. Nonbinary people should not be singled out for extra scrutiny. A choice and informed consent model would remove discrimination towards trans people and would provide psychiatry with an opportunity to prove its assertion that it provides a service that is valued by trans people.

I just recently saw a post on Tumblr that rather angrily denounced drag queens (no mention of kings) in the following way: (The post below is a parodied statement of what ""I love drag queens!"" really means)

&gt;I find the idea of men wearing dresses and atypical femininity funny or something to gawk at. I do not understand that “passing” as a concept is something trans women deal with for safety reasons, because non-passing trans women are at high risk for violence. Drag for me (and many drag performers) does not represent that gender expression can be fluid, but rather makes a point of laughing at people who do not 100% pass as the gender they are performing as and gasping in shock at people who do pass because we see trans and/or nonbinary people as less than human and incapable of beauty or looking anything like attractive cis people.

Is this a common position/view? I had honestly never considered this before, and as someone who has enjoyed a good many drag shows, it was kind of startling. I personally don't think of it as laughing at men in dresses at all -- it's not humorous, it's a different kind of performance.

I can see the point this is making, to some extent. It is a very binary-enforcing thing to do... but is it wrong for people to play with gender in a way that isn't addressing serious gender identity? That is, drag performance enacts gender temporarily for entertainment purposes rather than identifying with that gender in a deeper sense.

2015-04-15 14:55:13,32ov05,5,10,"My sibling ""J"" is 17, is a junior in high school. They are struggling with severe depression and our mother is extremely emotionally abusive, physically abusive (though very good at hiding this) and medically neglectful. Mom is a malignant narcissist and basically is incapable of feeling empathy, or seeing other people as people, rather than objects. Dad enables mom's abuse because he is afraid he will be subject to it if he resists or lays down boundaries. 

Last night, J came out to me as not feeling like a male person. J has been experimenting with femme dress for a couple of months, and I'd definitely had some suspicion that they would tell me this (though other people think it is just because they are ""weird"" or trying to be ""hipster""). I'm so honored that they told me, but I feel really powerless to help them or support them, because I live out of state and I'm also broke as fuck. Our parents would react really badly to this news (best case: Mom parades J as a freak to her friends, in order to show that she's the best martyr of all (/s)...worst case she puts J in a mental hospital or tries to get them to drop out of high school).  

Do you have any suggestions on how best to support J? They are very afraid that they will never be able to afford hormones/surgery and also they are generally very depressed and anorexic, also taking some kind of heavy antidepressant, to not-so-great effect.

I obviously am not going to out J to my parents, or to anyone. I am urging J to talk to a therapist, both about their depression and about the anxiety that comes along with coming out/being a non-cis person. 

My question is, what helped y'all when you were coming out / realizing you were trans? What are some good things I can do to support J (I mean, I'd literally jump in front of a tank for them)? What are things I should not do/ things that well-meaning people said or did that were not helpful?

I'm back at school now, and have been perpetually bothered by who i am and also why i'm not doing anything about it, outwardly anyway. I have about 2 years left of schooling, and currently feel like i should wait (should I?) to transition. The reasons will come with the root of the question:

I know it is terrible to assign gender roles to activities, and i wholeheartedly agree with that. However i'm not so sure the people that i would be telling have any grasp of that concept, so i will be approaching this from a societal norm perspective.

Most of my hobbies are what would be considered manly. I brew beer. I target shoot. I like cars, computers, and am really immersed in the tech world. And outside of my views on GSM, I lean pretty conservative. I used to be gung-ho republican in my earlier years but this whole experience has been eye-opening for me and now really value personal liberties and now see myself as a libertarian. The reason why I would wait to come out/transition is that due to my involvement in these circles, some of my friends are pretty religious and conservative. I cannot avoid these people for 2 years, my school is too small. I also don't want to cut out these people from my life, I still like them as friends no matter how much it hurts when they post or share transphobic things on facebook or bring them up elsewhere. I guess this puts me at an impasse.

When I came out to my mom, I saw a shrink, although it is one that I had been to before for other issues and she had little or no experience with gender issues. So when I told her how I was feeling, it almost felt like i was being judged on my perceptual ""manliness"" based on my hobbies and tendencies. Don't get me wrong, she was really understanding and all around a great person, but since then I have been pretty uncomfortable with the thought of coming out to anybody else because I feel as though i will need to prove myself, which is something i feel i cannot do.

With all that said, I feel like it is time to open up to a few of my closer friends at school, who I can see remaining my friends for a long time. These friends and I are in the prospective stage of opening a business, and I feel like it isn't fair to keep this from them, and it would be a real load off my chest.

I have never let myself express my feminine side before and I had repressed it for a few years.\n\nThe thing is that when I started to let myself do these things I felt a depression start. And a hate for my body. I knew what dysphoria is and I have had depression in the past and I realized that might be what it was. But the main problem is that if it goes away then I start to question whether I am actually experiencing it. I question whether all these feelings are legitimate. It just feels weird. Idk I guess this is kind of a rant/question. If any other people have experienced this please let me know."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""Sometimes I feel like the feelings of dysphoria I have are fake and it's really bothering me.

I'm incredibly happy for him and that fact he has been able to put everything out in the open, as was everything else, he was massively supported by everyone!

Yet 6 months on, I still struggle to make sense of the fact he is male. I understand and respect it entirely, and I wasn't that surprised when he announced he was a he, it's just my brain will not think of him as a guy. I'm not sure if 6 months is a long time, but we haven't seen each other in person much at all since then because he left his school for college, so I haven't spent much time around him 'as a guy'. In fact I just met up with him for the first time since I found out the other day. And it was perfectly fine, nothing was different to how it was before, as it should be. But when I'm referring to him to others while he's not around, it's pretty frequent for me to use female pronouns by accident still. My friends and I make an effort of correcting each other if we get it wrong, which helps a little.

And honestly, he's always been like a brother to me anyway, we've been tight basically since the day we met. I would talk to him about girls I was into, and when we hang out it was always in a friends way, never a romantic way. These are all things that help. Yet despite this, I still struggle with that final hurdle.

I'm sure this is a common problem that likely solves itself with time, but any advice to speed up that process of naturally seeing him as a guy would be much appreciated.",trans,What can I do to make it easier to view my friend as a guy?,1430371518.0,"{'created_utc': 1430346318, 'id': '34bvry', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 5, 'selftext': ""About 6 months ago, a close friend of mine made a Facebook post about his struggles with gender and let people know that he was trans, and not a female as we have grown to know him to be.
