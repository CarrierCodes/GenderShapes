I've been teaching a few years now and have met some of the most wonderful people I have ever met...and some of them are no older than 7. Because of how the program is setup, I get classes with a mix of low income inner city children, the upper middle class children. A few of the children I've taught were clearly of different sexualities and gender identities. On one occasion, a young boy (we shall call him Tim) came to class with painted nails, a tiara, and a golf skirt. A few of his classmates barely even acknowledged what he was wearing, while a few others had noticeable discomfort. Obviosly, due to my job, I can not push any personal beliefs on to the children, however, one of our main goals, is acceptance. At one point during the lesson, a boy (lets call him Bob) told Tim that he isnt allowed to wear girl clothing. Tim got upset and began to cry and I had no choice but to intervene.

I lived in Massachusetts (MA) for 40 years, minus a few whilst traveling to California (CA) and back in my 20's. During my time in MA, I was denied insurance coverage for -anything- related to transgender services. I had to pay out of pocket for anything I wanted, and got lucky with a few doctors who knew how to get me services without disclosing my transgender rationale. During this 20+ years, I gave up expectations of having any surgeries - I simply would never have enough money for any of them.

Well, in August I settled in Sacramento after battling to move out here for the past 20 years. I find out last week, Nov 5, that not only is coverage possible, but my wifes family plan (which covers me as well) has an amazing amount of coverage: 100% for all transgender surgeries, in patient, out patient, and hospital stays, as well as hormones and psychiatric visits. I called and verified that this is indeed the case.... I am still in shock.

However - I cannot find specific information about tracheal shaves, facial surgeries, etc. I know that I may be sent to Dr. Meltzer in AZ for surgeries, or possibly a doctor I cannot remember the name of in San Francisco (not Marci Bowers).

The other scary thing is that after 20 years of resigning myself to never having this opportunity, it seems I may have it sooner than I even dared to hope! I haven't been on hormones for at least 5 years, but when I was, I developed C/D cups. I have been ""RLE"" for at least the past 10 years, and have had both my name changed and my gender marker changed in MA.

What pitfalls do I have to look out for? What is likely to be covered under my plan (Kaiser - KFHP 1003 - Medicaid/cal Plan 3087851)? Does anyone have experience with this?

If I could get volunteers to look at my prototypes, and then fill out a quick survey, I would really appreciate it! The first Prototype is of a brochure designed to be handed out to Health care providers and facilities to illustrate the very basics in Trans-inclusivity. The second Prototype is a sicker (designed with transwomen in mind) that could ideally go on HRT boxes, given at functions, etc. My ultimate career goal is to help to achieve equal health care for all genders, so if you think of ways to make this sound more universal, please don't hesitate to include it in the comments section.

With the holidays coming up, I'm trying to figure out a good gift for him.  I'd really like to get him something that specifically relates to him being trans.  He likes reading, so maybe a book (fiction or nonfiction) that addresses being trans.  Anyone have any ideas or suggestions?\n\nhe's 18 and he won't tell me what he wants except that he doesn't want a packer or a binder.\n\n(cross-posted in r/ftm)"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Gift for my ftm little brother?', 'created': 1448510843.0}"

I've pretty comfortably identified as nonbinary for some time, and I guess I've been a little scared of committing to an identity I don't obviously outwardly portray.

However, I've recently been feeling majorly uncomfortable in my body. I've always been uncomfortable with my chest since developing breasts, but recently just the fact I have a female body just doesn't sit right with me. I've never sat still with my identity, and never subscribed to a binary, so I don't want to immediately say 'oh I guess I'm trans'. I don't know how long to wait until I should have a better idea of it. I get SAD, and it might be tied into my menstrual cycle, but at the same time I hate feeling so uncomfortable. I want to do something about it. 

I don't know what I'm asking for, perhaps advice? Maybe some of your ftm stories? If that's not too intrusive. I'm totally new to this.

Thanks already.

2015-11-27 20:08:56,3ui374,4,5,"I honestly don’t know what to do.  I’ve recently come out to my family and a couple of friends a couple of months ago.  Both my family and friends are supportive of it but with my family I feel that it is the elephant in the room.  I’m very apathetic around my family and I stay in my room 90% of the time when they’re home.  I rarely talk to anyone in my family.  I’m not social at all.  I don’t have any friends that I spend time with IRL but I talk to the few friends that I have online often.  I’m not in school at the moment and the only real human interaction I have is at my work.   I have yet to come out to the people at my work and I don’t know how to.  I want to shave my legs, get my eyebrows done, paint my nails, etc. but EVERYONE at my work is a complete bloke and I know I’ll most likely get shit for it.  I really want to quit and continue my transition in peace or start at a new job with a fresh slate but I need to save money for surgeries.  

I’ve recently started HRT and so far I’m loving the effects of it and am really excited of what’s to come.  The problem that I have is that I find everything so overwhelming.  I’ve never really been good with style, body language, walking and especially talking.  I find it very difficult to talk.  Words are difficult to recall and I have a very hard time controlling my voice.  It doesn’t help that I have a masculine voice too.  It causes a lot of dysphoria.  

I’ve been depressed/neutral for the past 5 years and I really hate myself.  Although I really want to transition I feel unmotivated to train my voice, learn fashion, learn makeup, and retrain my body language.  It is all feeling so overwhelming and I’m really feeling hopeless.  I just really wish something tragically unexpected happens and ends everything for me.  It would seriously make everything easier.  

Sorry if this post is really messy.  I’m a terrible writer and I’m currently sleep deprived.
