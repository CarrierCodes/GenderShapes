One being that i hope i don't offend anyone with something i say and Two being that this is a throwaway account because i didn't feel comfortable posting this on my main. Anyway for as long as i can remember I've always wanted to be a girl/female/lady (I'm a guy currently age 22 soon to be 23) and I never really thought to deeply into it except like ""okay well if that's just something i want but it'll never happen. It cant happen its impossible."" I never really knew what being transgender was before a few days ago when i looked it up. I always thought it meant that people had either the wrong genitals or both. Don't know where i got it from that's just what i thought. I honestly can't accurately describe how long I've always dreamed of being a woman. I've also been cross-dressing since age 14-15. Again something i just wrote off as okay it may be weird but it isn't anything major just something i enjoy doing. Because i do really enjoy it. I mean i don't think I've ever been happier than when I'm wearing a dress. I feel amazing, I feel pretty, I feel genuinely just happy. And as I've been scrolling through this sub I've read a couple things and I think I'm trans but I just don't quite know. I've seen people posting things close to my circumstances. And every time I've ever asked myself if i would change my gender the answer was always a gigantic YES. The question i have is AM i a transgender or am i just into some strange things because that's what I've always wrote it off as. I'm more than capable of accepting myself as trans if that's what i am but I'm confused. and i feel like this would be a good place to seek help.

Edit: So, here i am at 5:02am where I'm at. I've been unable to sleep and thinking about this post. I keep coming to a conclusion that i am in fact trans while thinking about some of the things i listed in this post. I also decided to try to say out loud to myself these words ""I want to be female. I've always wanted to be female. I more than enjoy cross-dressing, it makes me happier than I've ever been as a male."" and honestly saying those things out loud to myself has really cemented the fact that i do and have wanted those things for some time. I'm still confused on whether or not i really am trans and am still 2nd guessing myself a lot. I've been seeing a therapist for some time for some other issues I've had in life and I'm thinking about bringing this up to her. Also for whoever makes it through this post I'd just like to say thank you for reading and sorry for the extremely wordy story. Even if you don't comment and are just passing through.

2015-10-13 02:36:35,3oja7u,5,19,"Background: I'm a transgender female, pre-everything except for some counseling over the past couple years. 

Yesterday was the last day of Atlanta Pride, so my two friends dressed me up, did my make-up and took me to the parade. I wore a dark red top with these really pretty Indian style pants as well as some earrings and a necklace. I felt like a bollywood starlet!

What a great experience! My friends used my female name, and people we met and talked to used female pronouns. Getting to present and be treated as my true gender felt really liberating. I didn't make me feel ""all better,"" but I didn't have the sense of awkwardness and discomfort that I've experienced when presenting as a male in the past. 

The parade was also fantastic. The protestors shouting ""GOD"" and ""HELL"" didn't even bother me. It was a fantastic day to be LGBTQIAA, and I was sad to see it end.

Now, let me get to the two points. 

1) Having the experience of presenting as my true gender in public has taught me that I really am a woman, and there is a community here in Atlanta that will accept me that way.

2) This is the bad news; today, 10/12, was awful. After having a day to escape the discomfort of having to present myself as male, the discomfort came back worse than before. Wearing male clothes feels awkward, and although it's unrelated to gender expression, the sight my body's masculine features is now more depressing for me as well.

2015-10-13 03:34:40,3ojhaj,1,0,"Hey guys, I've been thinking a lot recently about my life and am interested in some opinions about gender related questions I have.

So currently I'm a pan male who when given the chance identifies as gender neutral. I have hated gender roles for as long as I can remember, and they have caused lots of problems in my life. Since I was a teen I have been saying if I could choose to be a girl, I would, but I'm still comfortable in my male body.

I frequently get depressed thinking about simple things like not being able to wear women's clothes without constant judgement (my GAD doesn't help D:). I envy the female body, but I don't hate my body, I just dislike parts of it. I am 130lb and 5'11, and I've been that skinny my whole life which I like, but I really dislike my body and facial hair, I shave when I find the time to deal with this.

Sorry if this all seems dull, just trying to add enough info as to not misconstrue my situation. I recently got some women's clothes and I really enjoy wearing them, but get anxious about people's reactions. There's just something about embracing my feminine side that makes me feel so good.

I don't think I want to only be feminine though, I wish I could just diminish some of my masculine traits and increase some of the feminine ones. While I'm sexually attracted to both sexes, something about the female body just clicks with me. Not in an exclusively sexual way either, it's just so beautiful, it makes me jealous in a sense. I would definitely trade this body for a healthy female body if given the chance, but as I said earlier, I don't hate this one.

I don't believe I'm trans, but maybe I am, I'm not sure, and that's why I'm asking for opinions. I think I'm somewhere in the middle, so I'll have to also ask some gender queer people, but you guys have been inviting to me in the past so I figured this is a good start.

Any opinions and help is appreciated. Asking me questions that make me question myself or answer questions myself would be awesome.

2015-10-28 01:11:24,3qi0hv,10,8,"Hey everyone.

I've had a strange past. I mentioned it in /r/gay, because at 25 I just came out. But now, I really think I might be trans, and it's starting to scare me a little bit.

Basically, I really got into drag a couple of months ago. I love it, and I started to really enjoy make-up and ""feeling the fantasy"". But, the more I think about it, and the more I play around with it, I really enjoy being a woman. I've even started incorporating more feminine traits into myself when I am out of drag. 

And it feels amazing. I love the softness, I love the elegance, and it just feels right. But at the same time, I have this weird habit of overthinking things, and just ignoring things that make me uncomfortable.

So, I don't actually know if I'm just being weird, and it's a ""grass is greener on the other side"" thing, or if I should bite the bullet and try out HRT and see how it goes. 

I'm just so confused, and I know no one can tell me who I am or what I should do, especially on the internet, because you don't know me at all, but I think I just want to talk about it, and work it out in my head more. 

I'm just scared, and I don't know how to think or feel right now.",trans,Just confused and freaking out a little...,1446019884.0,"{'created_utc': 1445994684, 'id': '3qi0hv', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 8, 'selftext': 'Hey everyone.\n\nI\'ve had a strange past.
