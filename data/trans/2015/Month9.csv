So I've been struggling with my voice for a while now... I've found videos and helpful guides and whatnot on how to self train one's voice to be a higher pitch (as I am MtF), but I always feel silly when I try to speak as such.

HOWEVER, today I had an epiphany during a class of mine. I'm a student at NYU Shanghai, and all the international students (non chinese nationals) are required to take Chinese Language classes. Just like all foreign language classes, we repeat words and read the text out loud A LOT. I realised that I don't feel at all silly when I practice my higher pitch while speaking in a foreign language, because it ALREADY feels somewhat foreign to me!

Recently, allot of repressed feelings that I've had have come back up.
When I was 13/14 (The general age for sexual confusion, puberty and hormones and all that. Blah) I used to dress myself up as a boy, it started out as a joking around sort of thing with my friend. But I loved doing it, we made a profile on that old website 'Tagged' where we would live out this other persona, and while I think it was little more than a bit of fun for my friend. For me it was something more.

Ever since then I just sort of ignored all the feelings I had back then. It was easy for me to brush it all off as 'Curiosity', because I was so young. Occasionally I would get the urge to crossdress again, but I never did.

But a few days ago I watched a music video for the song Sky Limits by Yohio. Yohio is a very feminine/androgynous male. I suddenly realised that I found that very attractive, that I liked thinking 'I can't tell if they're a boy or a girl'. Thats when I started to really dwell on my feelings of wanting to dress as a boy.

But I don't want to BE a boy. I know in my head and heart that I'm happy with my gender being female, but I also like to dress as a boy?

I'm so confused.

One moment I think I could be androgynous, the next I think that I may be gender fluid? And others I think that I'm just a girl who likes to dress as a boy sometimes.

I'm a little more stable on my sexuality, I'm pretty confident in saying I'm pansexual.

Last night someone tried to fuck my ankle up, this resulted in me having to go to A&amp;E.  Loads of blood, lots of pain.  

So as they are disinfecting it in the waiting room and putting a bandage on to stop blood flow, I mention that I'm trans and that I would prefer to be called by the right name.  No biggie, right?

Waiting room staff were lovely, looked after me very well.  I'm brought into the triage area, nurse was very lovely and very kind to me.  Added the notes to my file about pronouns etc...

So back out into the waiting room to wait to be seen by an actual doctor.

Roll on an hour...  I'm called by one of the nurses, she helps me limp into the room I was going to be seen in, not able to put any weight on my foot.  

This is where shit goes bad.  Excuse the language, but the doctor was a straight up *cunt* and I suspect something about it had to with the fact I'm trans.  

To start, she kept using the wrong pronouns.  Then, she started telling me a story about a trans person she had previously worked with, the tone was not nice.  She refered to her as a man, and admitted she didn't enjoy working with ""him"" (her.).  She was very openly hostile to me, I requested she call me by my name and to this I got a sigh and she just stopped using any name to refer to me or talk to me.  

I had to get 19 stitches and 12 paper stutres, and I was in absolute agony.  This is where things continue to get worse.  

The doctor accused me of self-inflicting the injuries.  She accused the cuts of being self-harm because of my history of ""mental instability"" (I was on anti-depresseants for 2 years when I was younger.) as well as the soft tissue damage.  Like yeah, right, I smashed a hammer into my foot and dragged nails across my foot.  Totally.  

So I ended up leaving with no pain meds, hell of a lot of stiches and just being told to keep weight off it.  

Today I'm in agony and just holy fuck if I wasn't in so much pain I'd be angry but I just can't be angry right now, don't have the fucking energy.

I\'m called by one of the nurses, she helps me limp into the room I was going to be seen in, not able to put any weight on my foot.  \n\nThis is where shit goes bad.  Excuse the language, but the doctor was a straight up *cunt* and I suspect something about it had to with the fact I\'m trans.  \n\nTo start, she kept using the wrong pronouns.

She refered to her as a man, and admitted she didn\'t enjoy working with ""him"" (her.).  She was very openly hostile to me, I requested she call me by my name and to this I got a sigh and she just stopped using any name to refer to me or talk to me.  \n\nI had to get 19 stitches and 12 paper stutres, and I was in absolute agony.  This is where things continue to get worse.  \n\nThe doctor accused me of self-inflicting the injuries.  She accused the cuts of being self-harm because of my history of ""mental instability"" (I was on anti-depresseants for 2 years when I was younger.) as well as the soft tissue damage.

I'm probably going to be dumb and ask something that at least some of you will find ignorant or offensive.  I really don't mean to, please don't attack me for it.  I swear I'm here to learn and expand my mind.

I haven't historically really thought much about the possibility of dating someone who is trans, but I recently ran across a profile of a trans guy on a dating site and I really like how he talked about himself, I felt he was attractive, and he seemed like someone I would be interested in getting to know more.  (For the record, I completely recognize that he may have no interest in me.  I just want to be a little less ignorant before I even reach out to him to get to know him.)

I have only ever dated/been intimate with cis gay men.  I am definitely open to the idea of dating a trans guy, but I want to understand what that might mean.  From his pictures, he's clearly had top surgery (he has some shirtless pictures), but obviously I have no idea whether or not he has had bottom surgery.  My understanding is that it isn't appropriate to ask, and in the hypothetical of dating someone, I wouldn't even have any idea of when it becomes appropriate to discuss that.

The thing is, I have only ever been with guys that have penises.  I don't know how I would react to being with a guy that doesn't have one.  I would feel truly terrible if I started dating someone, we reached a point of getting emotionally invested, and then it turns out to be a problem.  I don't want to waste his time or hurt his feelings if this is something that's too much for me, but I don't know how to figure out if that would be the case.

How have transguys here dealt with inexperienced partners in the past?  Are there any cis gay men that have dealt with this here that could give me some insight?  Anyone have some useful advice?

In essence, the thought of dating someone transgender makes me realize that I don't fully understand my own sexuality.  I'm gay...but I don't know if that means I'm attracted to the male gender or the male sex.  I've never been in a position to challenge that because every person I have been with has been a cis male.
