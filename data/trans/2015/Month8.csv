2015-08-07 16:25:55,3g57wn,18,4,"My boyfriend (not quite girlfriend yet) wants to have sex with other people to fulfill his girl side desires. 

This goes against my beliefs, which are that sex is practically sacred and should be with only someone you truly love. Also that I dislike open relationships. If you are in a relationship, you should be able to be satisfied by your partner. 

I thought I had been pleasing him enough, I mean I even do him in the butt sometimes and I treat him like a full on girl. I get him dressed up and use female pronouns, etc... I thought I had been doing a pretty good job at it too.

When he told me these even larger desires, I frankly got pissed and upset. Because we have different views on love (his being that sex and love are totally separate and that you can have sex with more than just the person you are in love with, mine being that love and sex are connected and that it should be with someone you truly love and trust), we have drastically different opinions on this. 

He claims to love only me and that he wants to be in a relationship for a long time, however, these words just feel empty because he tends to not back them up with his actions.

Its gotten to the point where he says he wants a break, mainly to fulfill sexual desires. There are other reasons he says, but hey, no ones perfect. 

I wouldn't be able to handle being with him if he were to take his break and fulfill himself. I'd beat myself up over it, over feeling like not good enough, and I feel that I'd end up not being able to handle it and want to just be done. It goes against my internal code, and to me.. it's honestly just cheating in disguise.

I know how sexual urges work, and I know that it is what he craves. I just think that he needs self control. If you're in a committed relationship, there needs to be self control.

I know I've put him in a hairy situation by giving him these crossroads. I want him to be happy, but at the same time if I let him be happy, it will cause me unhappiness. I told him he can either get the dick he so badly wants and loose me, or he can stay faithful and not get any dick. He is unhappy either way though...

He says I need to be more open minded about it, but I feel like I've opened my mind enough. I'm fairly sure that most people would have left him by now(due to transgender, sexual kinks, attitude), but I haven't, and he seems to not realize that.

He's going to Burning Man this month, and it has me extremely worried. He told me it'd be easy for him to cheat because it's a practically a spiritual and love festival and about being who you really are. I just feel utter despair and that he will end up doing it anyways, even though he doesn't want to make me upset.

2015-08-11 19:17:49,3gmnj5,12,11,"I have seen a number of trans people write blog posts and get angry over questions that a lot of non-trans people have. I don't quite understand why they get angry or upset... yes, people will often ask questions they wouldn't (under any normal circumstances) ask people who are non-trans, but the way I see it as this; I'd rather these people ask me strange or awkward questions and take a direct interest in the process and talk to them through it, rather than give them a cold shoulder or blow off. Every time you blow a person off because you think a question is stupid or bad or insulting, you have one less person trying to understand you. That is one less person who may have stood up for you in the future. If a question makes you uncomfortable, don't get angry or upset, just explain that the question makes you uncomfortable and avoid the rants about why its a stupid question (which would probably take far more time to explain).
 
You see, people tend to naturally understand female and understand male, so they don't really have much in the way of questions for the female/male body process so there's few questions to ask, but what many people don't understand is transitioning or the transition process... so, when they're asking these questions out of ""ignorance"", they're generally not asking them to be offensive, they're asking out of genuine curiosity because it's something they don't understand and they would like to.... which is why they are asking. For me, I'm even okay with strangers asking about my body parts when they find out I'm trans. I get it, they're curious, they want to have an understanding of the process.. and I'm okay with that curiosity. To be curious is to be human.
 
The other thing a lot of people talk about, staring.... people will often stare at trans people when they're noticed. Of course, this does make a lot of trans people uncomfortable as well... but, I think a good thing to remember when this happens is that not everyone is staring at you because they think you're strange or you're a freak... people stare when they take an interest in something or they are curious about something. You are interesting them, while they are staring at you they are thinking about you, being curious about you, and wondering about you. Not all stares come from people judging you or disapproving of you... and that's something maybe people have to remember when they notice strangers staring. Don't feel bad because they are staring... instead, feel empowered because someone is taking an interest in you. Smile, wave, make them laugh, leave them with a positive impression of you, and you of them. It'll make both your days a little brighter.

2015-08-23 15:58:34,3i391h,13,4,"Last night my girlfriend sent me this comic from the excellent ""The Trans Girl Next Door"" by Kylie Wu. http://transgirlnextdoor.tumblr.com/post/127354366269

It made me feel uncomfortable, both because of the content and how I view myself. I should explain; I have exclusively dated trans-women for the last 8 years. I have an overwhelming attraction to trans-women, to the exclusion of cis-women. I have known about this since 5th grade. While all my friends were talking about how attractive they found Cathy Ireland, I was thinking she was okay but I was extremely attracted to Tula.

The comic above paints trans-oriented men in a negative light, and in some ways that is understandable. If you look at the average guy in a club or a bar, (which is where it looks like this takes place) the single guys there will be looking to pick up women to bring home. (please note not all guys!) they aren't looking for a relationship, they are looking for sex. If you took the bottom scenario, and removed any reference to trans, it is still the same fantasy for douchebag guys everywhere. Sex without strings.

Now, I know there are plenty of trans-oriented men who are like this. But, I am going to say, to dismiss an entire group of people based on their attractions, because of a perceived stereotype is predjudicial.

So let's talk about trans-oriented men. Why do they have such a bad reputation. First, I would suggest is ignorance. Trans-oriented men through out a large part of the country, never met a trans-woman. They know of trans-women through tabloid television and porn. I am guilty as charged. Those were my first experiences with trans-women. Neither portrays an accurate or reasonable portrayal of who trans-women are. It leads to a prejudice in men that trans-women are extremely sexual. The general world at large also does not do enough to distinguish, cross dressing and drag from being a trans-woman. So if a man does seek out what he thinks is going to be a trans-space, he will go to a drag bar, where his stereotypes will be reenforced by prostitutes, and cross dressers who are looking for sex. I am not looking down on cross dressers by the way, but they are not the same as trans-women. If the bottom scenario in the comic was to happen there would most likely be a request for payment somewhere along the line.

The second is society. I have read some recent articles that say that in someways it is harder for a man to be trans-oriented than it is to be trans in this society. In my not so humble position, that is totally BS. I have seen what trans-women go through and I have been open about being trans-oriented and let me say there is no comparison. Watching a loved one being denied a bathroom in a public and humiliating way is far more hurtfull then being called faggot by a couple of kids at the mall. Still, there is a lot of fear about being different and people have such anxiety about coming out, that it does become a real issue for some people. Passability, becomes a ""need"" in order to protect the closet. So, trans-oriented people will tend to exclusively look for passable women to date, so that no one knows their secret. To be fair, in some parts of the United States, it is dangerous to be out. I would not want to go to parts of Texas and be openly trans-oriented. In someways, It becomes easier to be with a cis-woman and experiment with a trans-woman prostitute. I strongly feel that is why stories where a celebrity being caught with a trans-woman prostitute happen.

Personally, I worked through a lot of my feelings a while ago. I was fortunate enough, to have met wonderful people from all walks of life from the trans-community and I was smart enough to keep my mouth shut and my ears open to learn. I met wonderful people, who had hard breaks and were forced into sex work. I met determined people who worked hard and succeeded in their chosen field. I met people who managed to hide their status and live in total stealth. I met people who could not hold a job and were forced to live on Wellfair. I met nice people, crazy people, wealthy people, poor people, mean people, sexy people, unsexy people. In the end it boiled down to this: trans-people are people. They deserve the same respect and consideration as any other group of people. If I was truly attracted to trans-women, I needed to be fully open and honest about that. And, I came out. (hi, I'm straight!) I explained who I was and who I was attracted to in a Facebook post (my family already knew.) and I got positive feedback. I lost one friend, who was just a redneck kid who I didn't really care about anyway. Being out ment that I was able to date wonderful people, who I was extremely attracted to. I was able to be myself.

So, if you are trans-oriented, check out tsgirlfriend.com and transoriented.com. Both are great resources with articles for you to learn from. If you are looking to meet trans-people, don't do it through a gay bar or a drag club. Check out OK Cupid and answer an ad. Be upfront about who you are, but don't go looking for sex.

If you are a trans-woman, don't ignore a ""chaser"" out of hand. If you think there is some decency in someone, then at least talk to them. Chasers are people too.

Watching a loved one being denied a bathroom in a public and humiliating way is far more hurtfull then being called faggot by a couple of kids at the mall. Still, there is a lot of fear about being different and people have such anxiety about coming out, that it does become a real issue for some people. Passability, becomes a ""need"" in order to protect the closet. So, trans-oriented people will tend to exclusively look for passable women to date, so that no one knows their secret. To be fair, in some parts of the United States, it is dangerous to be out. I would not want to go to parts of Texas and be openly trans-oriented. In someways, It becomes easier to be with a cis-woman and experiment with a trans-woman prostitute. I strongly feel that is why stories where a celebrity being caught with a trans-woman prostitute happen.\n\nPersonally, I worked through a lot of my feelings a while ago. I was fortunate enough, to have met wonderful people from all walks of life from the trans-community and I was smart enough to keep my mouth shut and my ears open to learn. I met wonderful people, who had hard breaks and were forced into sex work. I met determined people who worked hard and succeeded in their chosen field. I met people who managed to hide their status and live in total stealth. I met people who could not hold a job and were forced to live on Wellfair. I met nice people, crazy people, wealthy people, poor people, mean people, sexy people, unsexy people. In the end it boiled down to this: trans-people are people. They deserve the same respect and consideration as any other group of people. If I was truly attracted to trans-women, I needed to be fully open and honest about that. And, I came out. (hi, I\'m straight!) I explained who I was and who I was attracted to in a Facebook post (my family already knew.) and I got positive feedback. I lost one friend, who was just a redneck kid who I didn\'t really care about anyway. Being out ment that I was able to date wonderful people, who I was extremely attracted to. I was able to be myself.\n\nSo, if you are trans-oriented, check out tsgirlfriend.com and transoriented.com. Both are great resources with articles for you to learn from. If you are looking to meet trans-people, don\'t do it through a gay bar or a drag club. Check out OK Cupid and answer an ad. Be upfront about who you are, but don\'t go looking for sex.\n\nIf you are a trans-woman, don\'t ignore a ""chaser"" out of hand. If you think there is some decency in someone, then at least talk to them. Chasers are people too.\n\nEdit: were not where', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Trans-oriented: In defense of chasers.', 'created': 1440370714.0}"
