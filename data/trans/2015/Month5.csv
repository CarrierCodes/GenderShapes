I have been attracted to trans women for a bit and brought it up to my girlfriend recently. I was so excited she didnt judge that I was attracted,  but she was a bit concerned about what that 'meant'.

Now, I in no way mean to be disrespectful of anybody, and want to point out that I dont like that trans girls get objectified in porn,  but thats what porn is about... and I guess who am I to judge the fine line between power and attention or whatever porn is.... but, I had sex with my girlfriend tonight with trans related porn and transition videos.

I wanted to share my experience with my girlfriend, she didnt judge me, and would consider maybe experimenting with more things like this.  She was concerned I may be gay or want to transition myself, which is not what I want.

Once again, I dont want to objectify anybody. . But honestly is there any hope in making a trans friend or finding a community or swingerss/trans party without objectifying the 3rd wheel?

What are your thoughts on transsexual prostitution?  Is that morally better or worse (better possibly because we dont want a poly relationship necessarily)

I'm not out so I was in boy mode very nervous of anyone saying something but my fears were unfounded as nobody was fazed by my presence in the slightest. Just being able to look how I want to in a public setting was one of the best feelings ever and I'm still ecstatic now that I'm home. Though the road ahead is long right now as in addition to the prospect of HRT I'm looking to grow out my hair and improve my diet and exercise as well as other goal so I can be proud of my body rather than uncomfortable in my own skin. I wanted to share my positivity and how I feel I'm on the right path for me.\n\ntl;dr: I went shopping and feel much better!    \n\n[A couple of snaps I took](http://imgur.com/a/RrwYh)\n\nI know I'm not passable and I'm still learning about what I think looks nice on me so please be nice."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My first non-online shopping trip [My first post after a long time lurking]', 'created': 1431421184.0}"

I am attracted to trans women. The idea of a woman with a penis excites me. I am attracted to them in the same way that I am attracted to a woman without a penis.

This is the part where I get into the ""I'm not racist cause"" part of the post. I have been an advocate for rights for all my entire life. I grew up in a small town, where using the word ""fag"" meant that someone was ""stupid"". I used it in that sense. 

When I hit college, and actually met some gay people, I stopped using it. I don't want a word that I use casually to ruin someone's day. I talked to my friends about it, and they have stopped using it, at least in front of me.

I identify as a straight male. I am attracted to women, not men. The masculine form does nothing for me. That being said, a penis on a woman DOES do it for me, as much as a vagina does.

I don't know how to go forward. I don't want to make ANYONE a sexual object. I don't want anyone to be more or less of a person because of a thing they have. I work hard in my life to make sure that every person gets the same treatment from me.

Thank you, so so much, for taking the time to read through this!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Names of my family],
I want to start by telling you that I love you. Your support and approval throughout my life have been important to me beyond words, and the bond we share as a family spending time together, caring for each other, is very precious to me. You might feel worried, confused, or upset by this, and I want to reassure you, before continuing, that I'm okay; I'm not sick, and I'm not in legal trouble. I'm really, really sorry if I worried you with this letter; I just want to tell you how I feel about certain things in my life, and help you understand my feelings a little better? Reading this to you is very difficult for me, so, I'd like to ask you for a bit of patience if it takes me some time to go on at any moment.

I've always been a very introverted person. You've all commented on it at some point; asked why I don't spend time with friends, or go out more often over weekends. Why I don't seem to meet a lot of new people, or keep my feelings to myself. Mom, you've asked me a hundred times if I was okay, to let you in, to tell you how I felt, and...I couldn't, for the same reason I can't tell other people the same, or talk about myself. I find it hard to show my feelings to others, because I'm afraid of being ridiculized, judged, or made fun of. Every conversation I have with people involves me showing my accomplishments to others; grades, titles, black belts, aspirations, trying to earn their approval because I feel, deep down, that they would never approve of me or love me if I didn't have any of those. I've felt depressed for a very long time, but thought I was supposed to bear it and carry on; that life was supposed to be hard, and it was like that for everyone. It has been difficult, made doubly so because I kept pushing away anyone who tried to get close to me, hid all of my feelings away from even you, my family. 

Throughout my entire life, I never felt like I fit in around the people I was expected to spend time with; that's not to say that I didn't have fun sometimes, but there was always something that didn't quite fit, something that felt wrong. I think you know that school was a difficult time for me, and I was bullied a lot; if not, I'm very sorry I hid that from you, too. I tried my best to adapt and fit in, and by high school, things were tolerable; I was never fully part of ""the group"", but at least I had a few people I spent time with, if never relaxed 100% around. I dedicated myself to my studies and my career, to become the best I could be in my field, leaving aside personal relationships and friendships, because it was easier to ignore them, to live alone, to find validation in being good at what I work on and bury my feelings inside. However, it has gotten to the point where I can't bottle this up any longer, where I can't keep going without confronting what I have locked away within myself. I want to share this with you, and be honest with you.

I'm transgender. I've felt I should have been born female for a very long time, wished I could be a normal girl at birthdays silently, even used to pray for it when I still prayed. There is a very negative image of what being transgender means in popular media, and just in case you have that impression, I want to make sure I'm being clear enough for you, so that you can understand; this doesn't mean I want to dress up because of some kind of sexual reason, or to put on an act. This has nothing to do with my sexuality, actually, or who I like, which is something I've never known because I'm completely unable to imagine myself with someone, male or female, while I'm expected to be male. This just means that I'm a woman, like half the population of the planet, and wish to be myself and live happily without having to hide who I am. I'm tired of filtering every thought I have, every word I want to say, to make sure it's something a boy would say. I'm tired of imitating people around me to try to find out how I'm supposed to act, and I'm tired of being scared all the time that someone will find out what I feel. I'm tired of hating my body, my appearance, and of having to hide that hatred.

I mentioned seeing a therapist this semester when we talked while I was away; she has been helping me come to terms with who I am, with the feelings I've hidden, but I want you to know that this is something I've come to realize on my own. It's not something I've chosen; I've hoped my entire life for it to go away, and life would certainly be a lot easier if it had, if I hadn't been born this way, but it's been on the back of my mind through both good times and bad times. I've come to accept that it's not going away. This is who I am, and it's not going away. The choice I do have, however, is whether to do something about it. Whether to continue living in hiding, or try to do something to help myself.

I'm not changing who I am. I'm still the same person, I'm still the child you raised. I still love you with all my heart, and want to make you proud. I still want to be a great engineer, and use my career to help others. I have wanted to tell you this for so long, but was terrified of losing you, of hurting you, of upsetting you. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sure we will have many conversations about this soon, and maybe you might feel upset or confused; I want you to know that I understand that this is difficult for you, too, and I'll try to be as open as I can, to be here for you as much as possible. You don't have to do anything right now, and if you need some time to process and understand this, that is okay too. 

I love you, more than I can express with words, and will never stop loving you,
[My name]

So, I am a teenager who, for my entire life, has identified as a male. Lately, though, I've started to wonder if that's how I really want to identify. I have not told anyone, even my therapist, about any of these feelings, and, for a long time, figured they'd just go away. While I did not always hate the idea of being a boy, I did always hate the idea of becoming a man. The facial hair, the deepening of my voice, you name it. Hell, when I was thirteen, I once got so nervous in public that I ran into a bathroom and literally tried to rip off my sideburns with my fingers.

I keep finding myself lurking on trans forums and googling questions about the whole ""transitioning"" thing, and I have to say, I feel right at home in the company of so many people who feel very similar to the way I do. Of course, I feel like I am in such a situation that transitioning or even so much as telling anyone would basically ruin my life. Because of this, I sometimes wonder if killing myself would relieve some of these feelings, seeing as I have no other way to do so.

**TL;DR: Identify as male, starting to feel like I should be female.**
