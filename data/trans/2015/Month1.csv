2015-01-28 12:24:14,2tyfq4,1,5,"I feel I'm at an impasse.  I'm broke, I'm jobless, I'm 28, and I'm about to lose my apartment, and all that just makes this so much worse.  I've wanted to be a girl for as long as I can remember.  I remember being 2 or 3 and my mom was cutting my hair.  She was real rough when she did that and it hurt and I was cold and I started to complain.  Her reaction was to ask me if I wanted to be a girl, as if it were a bad thing.  I said no, but even then, I wanted to say yes.  


At night, I used to pretend that me and my stuffed animals were a family and while I was ""Daddy"" occassionally, more often than not, I would be ""Mommy.""  I've known this whole time and yet, this whole time, I've been completely in the closet, hoping it would just go away.  My first time dressing as a girl, I was 4 years old.  I found that I liked it and for many nights thereafter, my mother would put me to bed and she would go watch TV in the living room.  I would then creep out of bed, go into her room, and find something I thought looked pretty and pretend I was a pretty lady at a dinner party or some such like that.  Then one night, she caught me.  She hit me and yelled as she made me strip out of her clothes and back into my pajamas and the next day, punished me by taking away privileges, for a week or a month, I don't remember, never again mentioning what had transpired the night before.  She kind of acted like she was doing me a favor that next day.  She never again mentioned that incidence, nor did she ever catch me again, but here and there, as I got older, she would make comments like ""oh, I wouldn't mind if you were gay but if you were transgender, I would be heartbroken.""  She would give different reasons for her heartbrokenness when the topic would come up, sometimes saying that life would be much harder for me as a transgirl than as a gay man.  


Not that I ever came out as gay, or ever even really thought of myself as gay.  As a man, I like women.  I sometimes feel as though my relations with women have been a way for me to live as a girl vicariously.  I have, however, had fantasies, many fantasies, of myself being a girl with a man, but never as a man with another man.  I used to tell myself that my sexual fantasies involving men and me as a girl, they were just a fetish.  That I could never *really love* a man.  But maybe I could.  I've had quite a few nonsexual fantasies involving myself as a girl with a man, more and more as the years have dragged on.  


My mother's scolding that night when I was a little boy who only wanted to be a little girl, of course, did nothing to help rid me of the desire to be pretty and girly but I think the effects of that night, as well as the way my mother and my peers referred to trans individuals, have probably helped a lot to keep these desires tucked far away all these years.  I can't fight the urge to dress up here and there--to at least feel a little like a woman, at least some of the time, but I've never come out to anyone, other than a few select strangers on the internet who I'd talk to once, maybe 2 or 3 times, and then never again.  I've never told a friend, a loved one, a girlfriend, nobody.  And now I'm getting older and broker and homelesser and I try to be hopeful.  I'll get a call about a job tomorrow, I tell myself, but even if I do, then what?  I'm still a boy.  


It's taken me a long time and I have to admit, sometimes I do still feel a tinge of shame when the desire seems to get too great, but the desire seems to come more and more often, and more and more, I feel like nothing I do from here on out matters that much because, as long as I have to be a boy, as long as I don't have the support that would enable me to enter a life of femininity, I'm not really myself.  I still feel the shame sometimes, though I know there is nothing to be ashamed about.  Of the few friends and loved ones I have left, I don't think any of them would have issue if I were to come out but I'm still not ready for that.  I need someone who at least somewhat understands what this is like.  I need someone to gain guidance from.  


I'm not just too broke, but too scared, too beaten and broken to embrace my femininity on my own.  I've tried a couple times in the past (online) but mostly I've just come across creeps, flakes, and jerks, and after a while, I just kind of gave up.  But as times have gotten worse for me in other areas of my life, the desire just comes back that much stronger.  My ideal situation?  My prince charming comes along, says ""hey, I know you're going through some rough times and I just want to help.  I'll buy you some clothes, help you with your makeup, give you a place to crash, and help you ease into this life as comfortably as possible.  Oh, and you know what?  I know of a trans-friendly business who's looking for some extra help and I can help you get an interview for next week so while we're at it, let's get you an interview outfit.""  Ideal circumstance.  I know that probably won't ever happen and maybe I won't even ever work up the courage to take the steps I need to to come out or embrace such a life.  Posting here, I guess the best I can hope for is a kind voice, a kind ear.  Venting helps when all else fails.  


I see girls when I go out, on the train, at my school, in stores and on the streets and I just want to be them so bad.  I want to dress like them, I want to walk like them, talk like them, move like them, and do girly things.  I see the way other guys look at them and I wish more so bad that a man would look at me like that, with me looking like she does.  I want it to stop more than I want to embrace it, but after almost three decades, I'm starting to realize that it won't stop until I'm dead.  Sometimes though, when I'm overly tired or my neurons are aligned just right, I'll be on my way home and I'll get it in my head that ""tonight, I'm gonna figure it out and I'm gonna go for it!""  Then I get home and use the bathroom and as I wash my hands, I see my face in the mirror and see that it's already matured into a somewhat manly shape.  And I have a slight Adam's apple.  And I have nice legs but my hands.  They're all big and veiny and oh, I could never be a woman.  And then I lose momentum and I'm sad until I go to sleep.  Then I wake up and look in the mirror and think to myself ""maybe I could pull it off, but better to not even try.  Mom was right.  It would be a hard life and life is hard enough as it is,"" and I push the thoughts, the feelings, the desires, I push all of it down as far as it will go but it always bounces back hard a few weeks later, a few days later.  


The world is harsh to us (and I don't mean just trans individuals, but everybody, in one way or another, but still, especially those who struggle with something like gender dysphoria, and, as the coward I am, I can't even begin to fathom the struggles of those who have embraced their dysphoria), but even moreso, we are harsh to ourselves.  I'm harsh to myself.  I've had thoughts of suicide throughout the years, almost attempted with pills a few years ago (threw them up immediately after ingesting).  I've had a hard life all around but sometimes I catch myself thinking ""if I could just have, at some point, rid myself of this shameful secret, this curse, would I have ever considered attempting suicide?  Would life have been as hard?""  


Sometimes, though, I wonder what my life would have been like had I been able to come out when I was younger.  Better maybe.  I would have built a base of friends within the trans community, and without, get a job writing for a magazine or periodical with a focus on trans issues or maybe get a job at a trans book store, meet a caring, sweet, and gentle man whom I loved and who loved me, save up money, freeze some sperm (so I could be a mommy!), and start on HRT, and somewhere throughout, go to school as a girl, be able to feel like a woman as I bought a squash and a roast beef to cook for dinner or just nail polish and cough medicine at the drug store or as I rode the bus home or as I rode the train to work.  Maybe it would have been just like that--a fairy tale.  Or maybe I'd have just had to deal with more shit and my mentality might have just stayed the same.  I'll never know what my life could have been like and maybe I won't ever know.  Maybe I should see a therapist.  Either way, I just wanted to get some of this off my chest.

So I actually started a post before doing a bunch of computer related shenanigans and closed chrome (with the in progress post).

Totally forgot cause I usually use Firefox and hey, what could chrome be running for right now, yeah? (Dumb)

So...

Okay, I'm 19.
19 and like 3 months-ish. I'm a guy, or at least that's what everyone tells me. (Except for my friends who joke about my long hair and call me a woman.. which both irks and doesn't irk me causeeeee..)

Okay so since I was about 12 or 10, y'know something around there-- (My memory is absolute garbage pardon, also lots of parenthesis with me going blah and stuff and words, sorry about that too)

-- I realized I wanted to be a girl. Or at least felt that way. At the time I was well versed in the use of the internet due to having one in the house for quite a while.

At the time I was pretty religious, mostly cause it was kinda shoved into my head by my parents (or at least mother) and prayed pretty daily. So I often.. prayed for some changes.

Obviously that did absolute diddly. I've long since abandoned religion (which is unrelated! but y'know it's a thing).

So for long as I could remember I've hated getting haircuts too. Parents say I kicked and fought when I was even younger than I can remember about them as well.

But well, didn't really have a choice for quite a while. Once high school started I got to keep it a little longer but the school itself was against boys having long hair and so... yeah.

Actually I got pretty horribly emotional over having to cut my hair near the end of senior year and just didn't know why.

When I was 10-12, something (sorry that this story is absolutely everywhere) made me google up body altering sorts of things. I was young, I believed in magic. 
I quickly stopped believing in magic once the internet threw proof at me. Good internet, teaching kids to not be dumb.

Annnnnyway.

Some combination of search keywords later and I ended up at a... transgender webcomic.

And I was absolutely confused.

Google against assisted in defining transgender.
And I was...  well, relieved. I think I understood what was up with me.


Let's fast forward to the present and stay there. (because the god awful memory does not lend itself to clear stories)

So for the past couple of months I've been in a serious rut.
I dunno why.

Well maybe I do, bad relationship, that could be why!
I told one of my best friends, who I've known for years (let's call him Ross) that I was bi (well really pan but explaining why I have a love of cookware just would be awkward jkbadjokeseverywhere) and trans.

And y'know, he seemed cool about it. (also the first person I ever told that I actually knew, not including random internet strangers that literally can't figure out who I am and therefore I felt safe at the time)
And then he totally changed his lifestyle, threw all of my secrets at my girlfriend of about 2 weeks... which ruined a lot.

Not at first, she seemed... okay with knowing everything (not that I wanted someone I just basically got close to to know absolutely EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFEanwaysorry..)
Ended up breaking up in part because of the whole.. trans thing. She thought it was something that could be cured, or that I could forget about (y'know technically I did for quite a while so maybe she's right..)

Anyway.

Lately I've been confrontational with my dad. I yell at him a lot for no reason (and promptly apologize because what the hell am I doing).

I don't really feel much of anything anymore.
Did share that in addition to being bi (explaining pan to a parent is probably less difficult than trans, but still), he seemed to think I was depressed (but took the bi thing pretty well!) and I kinda think i agree with him.

I'm really blank. I dunno.
Also dysphoria is actually becoming a problem. I realized that I've basically just been running on instinct and not thinking about anything at all. Which is probably why I was able to push aside the trans thing, I thought I had time. I mean I knew the earlier you transition the better to like offset ""natural"" puberty and all that jazz, but still... y'know, time.

I'm 19 now.
I've said that, and I realize I'm running out of time for a ""successful"" transition.
While I've previously said I don't really feel anymore, I just kinda.. know I'm fed up with all the pretending. I despise the stupid beard that gives away in like .1 seconds that I'm a guy. My hair's quite long now because... college, no one can tell me what to do in that regard anymore. Kinda feel like I could pass if I could just like train my voice (been trying, no success. as it stands my normal speaking voice is kinda odd too really so hey maybe it's a personal problem) and make the beard GTFO. (shaving sucks for me, I bleed a lot, oh well dx)


Anyway..

I want to come out to my parents. I need help with the actual transitioning and well.. parents are supposed to be supportive, right?

I mean my dad's actually really amazing and I hate myself for being such a dick when I was younger to him. He'd probably help if he took it well..

My mom's an absolute religious nut. While I love her, I highly doubt she'd accept me.


To anyone who's gonna say ""move out and do it yourself!""
I've thought about it.
I've got a job, however it's part time because college and I can barely manage to keep my grades together with the rediculous amount of sleep I get (2 hours a night for the previous semester), trying to get more but still.

Also I'm from fairly big city, and everything is expensive. 
So from healthcare (I have none, still on the parents plan and that is a blessing if I ever did see one) to school to... transitioning. I don't think I can do it on my own.

Not for a while.

And I want to get this done before it's gonna be half assed.

Not saying people having had successful transitions in their later years, I've seen a lot and you guys are absolutely amazing. (also when I say guys it's like the general ""all you guys"" sorta thing I don't mean you're all dudes sorry sorry words)

I just uh, I don't know if I can wait.
I mean I could but.


I'm a mess. I accept that.
I don't talk to people much about anything or my feelings(hah what feelings) or how I think but..

This is I guess the balancing out. Tell the internet! Try to get some help, ey?

So if anyone could give me ideas to coming out to my parents (or at least my dad) that'd be.. fantastic.

Or, if you'd like to talk about anything else, feel free to say.. anything else. Really I'm uh... I think I'm lonely.

Also this is a throwaway and the most interesting thing you'll find in my profile is... this post. And any subsequent replies. I think. Yes.
