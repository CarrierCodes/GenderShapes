So I've been to the doctors, had blood tests, sent out the reccomendation all fine, but as I already knew I've just been told there's at least a 3 and a half year waiting list (in the UK) for HRT and the only reason I've forced myself to come out to my parents about changing is because I'm getting more and more depressed as time goes on being male.

I know I'll maybe get advice such as ""just dress and act feminine for the 3 years theres nothing you can really do"" but I am obsessed with cute things and asian fashion, so being a cute female would be my absolute dream come true, I can't really imagine the masculine effects my body would gain in the next 3 years not to mention if I am to grow any more (I'm around 6ft now) I almost feel as if I wouldn't make it 3 more years which is quite a scary thought.

2015-12-14 16:52:23,3wsysk,1,5,"I came out as transgender some months ago and much as I thought it might not be a problem to those I'm around, I hadn't anticipated the response I got. I've been transitioning for almost a year. It's been paced, and I've been doing most of it in private, but I found the courage to come out and live life as I am.

I'm asexual and null gender to be exact. When I came out to other people, their response amounted to a mix of ignorance and stubborness, to outright transphobia. I'm male-assigned-at-birth but I don't use male pronouns and that's one of the things other people are refusing to use. I was told face-to-face that I need to accept that no-one is going to begin using the pronouns I prefer and the it got treated as though it's an exception.

I was also told repeatedly that though I might be emotionally male, that I'm physically male and so I don't need to change anything. I know that to be wrong, but I didn't argue. What's worse is that again I was told, face-to-face, that no-one I came out to is going to teach themselves about transgender issues.

2015-12-15 20:05:35,3wzdul,4,6,"As I've come to get to know myself over the past few years I've noticed these tendencies of divulging into my female side come and go in waves. They flow up on my shore and excite me, driving me to do outlandish and absurd acts, and then they ebb away leaving me confused and distraught, not knowing who I am. Each time these emotions well up inside me I find myself pushing the limits further and further, not knowing where they will take me.

As Halloween approached a couple months ago (it had snuck up on me as always) I found that I didn't have a costume ready! I racked my brain trying to think of something clever, or maybe a great pop culture reference. But as the day approached I found that I had nothing to go with and not enough time to really make something great.

When I mentioned that to my friend that I didn't have a costume she told me I could borrow her 'Brick House' costume, which was a tight full body suit that looked like bricks laid out for a wall and a foam hat that looked like the roof to a house. Cute, I know.

So, deciding I didn't want to go without a costume, and completely obsessed with the idea of going out dressed up I agreed and went to pick up her costume.

After picking it up I went with my girlfriend to a friend's house to eat Chinese food and get dressed up. I put on my costume, stuffing up fake tits and such. Then my girlfriend put on make-up and I put on nail polish. When some of our other friends arrived there was another guy who had dressed up in a nurse's outfit. I was so thankful for this because it made me feel better about going the way I was. While he was going for 'dude in a nurse's outfit', I was going for broke trying to pass myself off as a woman as best I can. I felt extreme relief that he was going as well.

The bar we went to was hosting my friend's band, so naturally I knew most of the people there. When my friends saw me they couldn't help but laugh and I laughed with them. It was funny. My female friends, however, couldn't stop telling me how pretty I looked and that with a few modifications I could be completely passable. Their compliments made me feel so good, and after a few drinks and some dancing I felt myself sink into my female side, perhaps a bit too much.

I felt extremely feminine all night which was amazing. I could feels eyes on me wherever I went. Some were curious, some confused. Some people laughed, others scowled. No matter how anyone reacted to me, it felt great. Even the rednecks who looked like they wanted to take me to the back alley and beat me to hell for being who I am... even that felt good. I loved the way being so exposed made me feel. I felt like I had nothing to really hide from. I felt like it brought out my truest self and that it showed me who was real, kind, and compassionate, and who wasn't. I may have ensconced myself in my female role a little too much, and may have shown a little too much.

Back at our friend's house while smoking jazz cigarettes on the back porch we relived the night. Mostly everyone had taken off their costumes, but as for me, I kept mine on. I wanted to live this feeling out for as long as I could while I was comfortable with it.

While talking to a friend of mine she couldn't stop telling me that she ""could only see the feminine side of me"" and that she thought I was very pretty. She was surprised in me for doing this, most people probably wouldn't expect if from me, however when they know, it makes sense. She kept asking me if I'd ever felt like I should have been a woman and a hundred other similar questions, and I was truthful with her.

At another point in the night another girl stopped mid conversation and said, ""Christina, don't you lie to me, you like this!"" Before a response from myself was delivered, the focus of everyone in the room drifted to some other topic, leaving me not having to answer.

Being 'outed' by those two girls was a moment I wish I could have gone back to. I felt so ready to just let everything about me out right then and their, but I held back and let the attention fall off of myself. I told myself in the following days that I should connect with those two girls and really tell them everything, but I never did. I felt the momentum had passed, and that I was in a lull again.

2015-12-16 10:42:18,3x2d38,5,5,"Okay... So, I'm sure this has come up before, but:

I have no idea if I'm transgender or maybe should just be diagnosed with transvestic fetishism. 

A lot of the time, it feels like dressing up (always in the house) is primarily sexual. I dress up as a woman, masturbate, then it's over. I'll do the same the next day, and so on, for maybe a month or so until the ""urge"" goes away. During this time I'll typically shave my whole body. Then, stupidly, I'll throw away all my clothes and breast forms and makeup. It gets expensive. I do all this, then find the urge coming back anywhere from 3-6 months. 

Even when I don't have an active urge, though, I find myself admiring women. It's sort of funny, because I have a dual train of thought going through my head: 1. Oh my god, she's gorgeous, I want to have sex with her and 2. Oh my god she's gorgeous, I'm so jealous of her I wish we could swap bodies. Very weird feeling. I'll usually get those pangs daily (though not always consciously).

So I guess I'm just confused. It feels like 70-80 percent of me thinks this is just a sexual thing. But the remaining 20-30 percent isn't so sure, and finds herself looking at /r/transtimelines wistfully or wishing that herbal pills actually did anything for breast growth. I got a blood test done at the behest of my therapist to see what my estrogen and testosterone levels were, it came back that I had normal T levels, and my estrogen was really high for a male. And frankly that's what it feels like, like there's a Jekyl and Hyde going on in my brain sometimes. (Sidenote: this was a few years ago when I was in the military... the urges died down and I moved, therefore the therapist and I didn't really get to discuss this for more than a few months)

Here's another thing that makes me think that it's not exactly sexual (or maybe it is, i'm no psychologist): when I was growing up, you know how your older sisters/cousins/whatever would dress you up as a girl? Well, I got very good at manipulating these girls into doing that ""against my will"" so I could keep my dignity, but I secretly loved it. In first grade I would play this game with this girl where we would go to the library and pullout the biggest books we could find and pretend we were casting spells to change bodies. I remember in the fourth grade, I went to the bathroom and tried to stick a toilet paper roll in my pants to get the ""flat"" look girls had. These things can't be sexual, right?

I tried once to get dressed up in front of a very good friend at her house and dance femininely, but I felt so awkward and weird that I didn't dress after that for about 2 years. Which makes me feel like I'm obviously not transgender. But man, there's a lot of evidence. I just don't know.

Is there like a litmus test? Something I can do? To help let me decide one way or the other. I know in the end only I can really *know* but it's so maddening and I need help.

2015-12-20 15:50:48,3xl4zw,4,7,"Hi, I'm a 22 year old Transwoman who hasn't come out yet. I'm already walking around with the Trans feeling for a long time but I keep getting closer in the need to get out.

The thing is, it's hard for me to do so, as I was a 8-year old boy I was already excited of the military, especially of flying an aircraft. This wish has always being very strong to me. Which causes me to be confused, as it is not very feminine. I know the function itself is very hard to become, as it's three in 1000, but I have done several none official tests (due education recruitments) and I score real high. I live in the Netherlands which is country where LBGT acceptance is real high. However don't know how that counts for the military and especially with flying.

2015-12-24 04:57:40,3y1rwx,5,10,"Hi there, don´t know if this is the right subreddit - but it is 6 am here soon, and I need a to rant a bit.

I am born male, and I came out as pansexual a year ago. Both my parents were livid, but fortunately had amazing friends at the time. 

I can remember all the way back to when I was 8 years old, that whenever me and my friends was outside playing star wars - I always got to be princess Leia. Just like in the movies I got my friends to rescue me. It wasn´t until much later I connected two-and-two to my sexuality. 

Now at 17 years of age, soon 18, I´ve started to grow frustrated and bitter. It is the weirdest thing. It is not envy, it is straight up jealousy of women. Whenever I read twoxchromosomes here on reddit - I get so jealous that when I´m done reading that I actually become angry. Though not sure at what. 
I could be reading an article about the vagina, and the menstruation that comes along with it - and I am still triggered. It doesn´t matter the subject.

My ex is a male, though I am currently in an relationship with a female. Sometimes when we´re having sex, this jealousy and bitterness sneaks up on me. Even in the most intimate of moments, although not always. I am jealous of her vagina, her curves, her hair and everything feminine about her. I wish I could be as cute as her and be a real girl. 

I´ve crossdressed for something around 3 years secretively at home, although I have until recently wore exclusively girls clothes everyday. I changed my wardrobe from girls clothes to male clothes because I gave up on being pretty, and realized I would never be as cute as ""the real girls"". I´ll always be stuck looking like a male, awkwardly engrossed in girls clothes. Sorry if that offended anyone, but I am led to believe that this is where some of the bitterness comes from. The fact that I will never be born a female.   

At this point I don´t even know what my question is anymore. Whenever I am alone, and truly feel free to be whom I want to be, instead of the one who society has constructed me to be; I get these thoughts. The thoughts of a life in a woman´s mind, and body. Whenever I am put in a social situation these thoughts usually don´t spring to mind. 

If I was given the ability to go back in time and be born a female, I would say yes - but the thought about losing my current girlfriend makes me terrified. We were best friends for 9 months, and at certain point in time I kissed her accidentally while thinking about doing it; we´ve been together since and we´re inseparable. 

I would really appreciate if I got a little response, and if anyone has been in the same situation it would be nice to hear from you that I am not alone. This rant is probably a mess, and if there were things that did not come fourth as clear as it should have, or you´ve just got questions unrelated to the text - go ahead and ask.

2015-12-29 08:29:19,3ymw4r,2,8,"This is going to be a bit long, but here it is:

A very close high school friend of mine is a trans woman who began transitioning about a year ago, she currently lives across the country from me (in the same city as one of our friends) and I'm very concerned about her mental health and safety. Like me, she is in her early twenties and graduated college last spring. As of right now she is unemployed, does not have stable housing (is staying with friends), and does not have a clear path out of this situation. According to my other friend, she has been getting by through the kindness of friends and by shacking up with strangers she's met via tinder and whatnot. Obviously, this is not a stable situation for her and my friend and I are incredibly concerned about this.

On top of this, my friend and I are very worried about her mental state. Last spring, she was committed to a psychiatric facility for what she described as a ""break from reality"", and my friend has stated that in person she appears to be manic, somewhat out of touch with reality, and generally not acting like herself. From my interactions with her online and over the phone, I tend to agree (based on admittedly limited information).

She has a college degree from a very prestigious school, has good work history, is very smart, and comes from an economically stable family. Transphobia aside (and that's a big aside), she is very well equipped to make a stable living for herself. My friend and I are both unemployed, so we can't give her financial support, and the responsibility to help her obviously lies with her family.

However, the problem is that (according to her) her family is totally unsupportive. Her mother is somewhat accepting, but has not accepted her trans identity; Her sister has totally rejected her trans identity; and her father has become substance-dependent and emotionally unstable because of his transphobic reaction to her coming out. As a result of her father's toxic reaction to her, her parents' marriage has been breaking down as well. 

But based on her shaky mental state, my friend and I are not entirely sure about the family story. She has had a tendency to lie in the past (including details about her family) as well, which adds to the problem. This also seems to be very out of character for her family, which by prior judgements was a stable, supportive, and progressive family (of course, abusive and intolerant family dynamics can hide beneath this veneer). This has made us question how much of the rift between her and her family has to do with their rejection of her, or her rejection of them.

We're really worried, and we want to talk to her family about the seriousness of her (tragically common) situation. And on the chance that the story about her family isn't entirely true, and they may not be as fucked as she's said, we want them to help her out (because she's their fucking child). 

I don't want to stir up the family situation any more, and put her or her family members at risk by contacting her parents about this directly (as they, mostly her father, seem to be the source of the problem). So, as imperfect as it may be, I want to talk to her sister about what the family situation is; and based on this information, make a judgement about whether or not to contact her parents). Obviously, I would want to have this conversation under complete confidentiality and I wouldn't reveal any details that might compromise my friends safety or mental well being (contact info, location, etc).
