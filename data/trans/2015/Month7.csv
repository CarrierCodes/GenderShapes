There was always a ""but"", always an asterisk, always the feeling that I'm not ""really"" a man. But that's not true. Transphobes be like ""oh you're just a woman pretending to be a man"", but no, I'm a man who finally, finally stopped pretending to be a woman. Full stop.

And I've been so, so excited about it. I feel like my entire life has changed. I'm so happy. I've cried from joy so many times this past week. People have called me ""Adam"" without me asking. So I don't blame my partner in his excitement when he wanted his parents to use the right pronouns with me.

My partner accidentally outed me to his parents on the way to their house for 4th of July. He asked them to use the correct pronouns. I was so mad. His mom knows, or must know, he reasoned. She's my facebook friend where I am basically dealing with my actual coming out. He was trying to help. 

But I hate those moments where the sentence stops and jerks at the pronoun because someone is unsure or uncomfortable.

I feel like there is an elephant in the room. I feel like I should be acting more masculine. Like they look at me and they still see and girl and go ""wtf?"" 


I don't care if you call me ""she""; because you think I'm a girl. The problem isn't the word, *the problem is you think I'm a girl*. Unless/until you can accept that's not true, then just don't try. Just use feminine pronouns and I will deal with how that feels. Whatever. Because this awkwardness, this sticking out, this feeling of every eye being on you and finding you deficient as a man is not okay. If you can't do it, then don't try unless or until you can. It just hurts. I'd rather just keep pretending to be a normal girl than feel like an abomination of a boy.

2015-07-16 01:58:43,3dgfuu,10,11,"I finally got a copy of the Summary Plan Description (I'd bet most people don't read these things) and I have this to say:

*Fuck* the transphobia of my progressive, gay-friendly employer.

Their policy extends spousal benefits to domestic partners without discriminating on sex.  There is a clear standard for who is eligible (both legally single, common welfare, shared residence), and while I can see cases of inequality (what if your domestic partner is on military deployment?) I get the sense that someone somewhere tried to do the right thing.

But, this, this exclusion is shitty:

&gt; 25 [expenses for] therapy, supplies, or counseling for sexual dysfunction or inadequacies that do not have a physiological or organic basis.

&gt; 26 [... (next paragraph) ] drugs or supplies used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, impotence, or sexual dysfunction or inadequacy [...]

&gt; 27 [expenses] for or related to sex change surgery or to any treatment for gender identity disorders.

&gt; 28 Those for or related to artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization [...]


Because clearly changing sex is one of those want-not-need things like fertility or sexual adequacy.  Next up they exclude non-medical counselling (financial, career, pastoral...), acupuncture, speech, and cosmetic treatments.

(But wait!  Bottom surgery for your intersex infant is covered.)

Fucky fuckity fuck this nonsense!  Especially since the plan is administered by Aetna, known for being not-too-terrible to trans people.

And especially after my parents taking me out of therapy because they didn't like what they were hearing.

Just venting, not ready to shame my employer (since I haven't given them enough chance to *fix it dammit*) but it's a well-loved American brand.

Feel like I might have to find trans-friendly legal help.  Gonna start with with the personnel department though.

---

UPDATE (good things!)

I missed the chance to call Personnel after work (graveyards) - was very much going to but had half a pizza and one drink and decided sleep was the right choice.  It was avoidance behavior but still the right choice: I feel *really* good with a day's sleep behind me.

Tomorrow I'm going to reenroll myself in the outpatient counselling program I had been in.  New location, new person (prolly will see someone for intake and someone else for treatment but I know the routine).  This time I'm going to make gender dysphoria my primary complaint and HRT referral a goal from the beginning.

Like, legit, I wanted to work on anxiety before (this place is not IC, but neither is it gatekeepy) now I'm pretty confident where that anxiety is coming from.

Insurance or no (they're in-network) I can afford this much and it'll be good to get the ball rolling again.

As I comment below, it looks like Aetna's policies for coverage are new and it might just be that my plan is older and slated to be updated.

I've got this problem. 
I have a very good friend whom I adore. I've known them for three years and in that time we've managed to form what I think is a very special bond. Last year, they said they preferred ""they"" instead of their assigned gender. 
I have zero problem with this. I'm transfemme myself and was very proud of their decision to declare their pronouns. (I respond to she/they/he)

However. 

I've noticed that sometimes when I've had a couple of drinks or bowls or both, I keep using their rejected pronoun! I certainly don't mean to. But somehow, in my frenetic talking, it just slips out. Sometimes I don't even know I'm saying the wrong one. 

What can I do?

When I'm sober or even freshly intoxicated, zero problems. It's all smooth sailing until I don't realize I've slipped. Then begins a downward spiral where I feel totally shitty about my participating in oppressing my friend and, though trans myself, creating an unsafe environment (As one should, imho).

2015-07-26 20:48:01,3ep1h4,0,1,"I will be cross-posting this on other trans/genderfulid/lgbt subreddits as well, the more help the better.

The Following is the first draft a letter coming out to my aunt, I am looking for advice on phrasing, ideas about other things to include (pm me if you want to know any details that help with this) grammatical help. 

And for context the bit about my mother, I was 19 or 20 and already adult, paying my own bills and paying rent to her (I did not rely on her at all other than that the rent was cheaper and I know possible roommates at the time)


(Insert Aunts Name), I really don’t know how to start this and I really apologize if this rambles, it is very hard to even think about discussing what I wish to tell you. But the following is a huge part of me and my life that I have tried my hardest to keep hidden, and hopefully it explains my hesitancy to do things with family/ my absolute need to move out last year.

	I guess starting way back at the beginning is the best way. As I am sure you are aware, I had been bullied and picked on most of my younger years for people perceiving me as gay and feminine, I couldn’t go a day without being called “faggot”, “homo”, “sissy” and those are just the least offensive things that I have been called in my life. People constantly tried to fight me, tear me down and threaten me, and this was to me at the time, unfounded and irrational and so I tried my hardest to deny those claims and things, and just ignored it, at the cost of my own happiness and self-discovery. Fast-forward to high school where I started to get an inkling of just who I was, but I still had this mental block due to the daily harassment I dealt with, I couldn’t allow myself to feel the things that I so freely do now. And top that all off with the anti-LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) attitude I got from my mother, and I was just a total mess, I was confused, depressed, angry, and resentful of a lot of people and things, but mostly of myself, because I thought something was wrong with me. But in private I would try to explore my feelings and self.

I was very confused about my gender identity and sexuality, but I have come to terms with that in last 4-5 years, which is the biggest reason why it seems like I have dropped off the face of the family. To put it bluntly, I am Pansexual ( I am attracted to anyone, no matter what gender people self-identify as) as well as gender-fluid (meaning that I feel both like a male and a female, but more so one then the other on any day) and that means that when Identify as female, it’s the whole package, clothes, make, prosthetics, the whole works, which helps me deal with the amount of gender dysphoria I feel (not feeling like your body matches your brain). Now looking back at myself through all that stuff I dealt with and subconsciously suppressed, it all makes perfect sense.
Obviously I have tried my absolute hardest to keep this from being found out by family, though as of late I have cared less and less, but it’s still hard because here comes the reasons why I am terrified to be who I am to family. Starting with my mother, we fell apart because one day while I was out she “though something smelled like it was burning downstairs right under where my closet would be” so she decided to “check to make sure my closet was not on fire” (which is absolute crap, she has always snooped in my life. Always) So she goes in to find all my female clothes hanging up (ALL of them) in plain view in my closet (it was my closet which she had no need to ever go in, so why should I hide my things) she then proceeds to not only start seeing a therapist, but started telling her close friends, all this speculation about me (people that I had to see on a regular basis) and personal stuff. In addition to that she would borrow my laptop (which I let her do) and she would look through my face book (I didn’t log out because it was my computer, and normal people log out of other peoples stuff when its left up) at my posts, my pictures, my friends posts and pictures, she would look through things that I set as privet so only one or two people could see them. I have screen shots of GOOGLE searches she performed ON ME, using MY COMPUTER, things like “(Insert My Name), Gay” “(Insert My Name), Homosexual” etc....etc.… she also found my online diary for lack of better phrase, and the more and more she saw the more upset she would get.  
Finally she confronted me about it more than a MONTH after she saw those things and was seeing a shrink. This is where it gets especially cruel, She started constantly telling me she was praying for my soul and, that “she didn’t want me to go to hell”, or she would tell me that “this is wrong, you have a disorder, It’s not right” one time I went out presenting female, and heading to my friends for a birthday, actually feeling good about myself and She was sitting on the couch as I left and said “You know what you’re doing is a sin right?” She at one point forced me to see a therapist with her (under potential threat of getting kicked out) and the first one we saw, who was not a Christian, and was not immediately mortified by me and my identity and preferences, my mother said when we were done that we were never going back, she then found a “Nice Christian therapist” who was much more likely to agree with her. What it boils down to is that my mother still makes me feel like less than human with the things she says sometimes, and I can NEVER be myself around her, EVER. All I ever hear is “god loves you” and “hate the sin, not the sinner” She refuses to accept who and what I am. So add to that the messages about non straight sexual orientations that are taught at her church, and the occasionally offensive joke or statement made by (insert aunts family's names), you get the reason why I am almost never around. I would love nothing more than to be myself around those who are SUPPOSED to be there for me, but I can’t feel that way, instead the thought of presenting female around family makes my stomach turn and makes me feel like I am trash.

I am writing this to you because I want you to hear this from me, and not from your kids, or my mother.
I have dated and loved women, men, transgendered women, none of whom I ever brought around for fear of what might be said. And I identify as both a male and female, and prefer appropriate pronouns for which gender I am presenting, if I come over in a skirt and makeup with prosthesis’s in, then you better use she/her/hers, otherwise if it’s clear I am presenting male, he/him/His, is the way to go. 
I’d love to actually talk this out in person, but a letter works until I know where you stand.

I love you (Insert Aunts name), and I really, deeply hope that you can accept not only who I am, but also my reasons for how distant I have been in recent years.

If after reading this you still care, and want to talk to me about it, just give me a call and I will come over or meet you somewhere.

So, I want to appear more like a girl and despite my hair being currently short and boyish, I decided to do the one major thing that would bring me at least a step closer to womanhood: shave all my body hair! &lt;3

I did a great job on lower legs, they feel so smooth! But I ended up leaving several razor bumps on my thighs. Ugh, I knew I should have shaved with the grain all the way through! So I'm not sure if I should keep shaving there...

Also, with all the body hair out of the way, I'm now noticing various nasty looking horizontal lines that go up my thoughts. Are these stretch marks?

Any advice on treating razor bumps and stretch marks would be much appreciated!! Also, please tell me ... does it get better? Does it get easier? Does your skin eventually get used to it? 

Ok thx in advance &lt;3 xoxoxo",trans,"Stretch marks and razor bumps on legs, ugh!!",1438347167.0,"{'created_utc': 1438321967, 'id': '3f9aq4', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ""Hai guyysss, I just turned recently 20 and I have pretty much accepted the fact that I am transgender. \n\nSo, I want to appear more like a girl and despite my hair being currently short and boyish, I decided to do the one major thing that would bring me at least a step closer to womanhood: shave all my body hair! &lt;3\n\nI did a great job on lower legs, they feel so smooth!
