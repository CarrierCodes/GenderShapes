With stone-red and grey-haunt faces presiding dutifully over tromped valleys, 
leaving only snake-coiled moss to grow in such prodigious umbrage.
The chorus from the peaks is but a small echo of the same tired voice,
left with nothing but annular logic, weary in its grayed blunt.
Stubborn heels dragging the swampy blood-clay,
the grounded tapestry left pocked and unpristine, stained.
A new normal of aeonian lucubration and recycled convictions
swirls in the tainted green-and-blue ether, oscillated by dogmatic remnants.
A crowing that attracts the flies and fills the ears of the spring,
left to either accept the tumbleweed's shit-laden bristles 
or cast aside the fading embrace of yesterday and accept the fated gale.
The thunderous, muted meaning reverberates across enervated herds,
a slog indignantly imperceptible to the purveyors of such cardinal madness.
Solicited risks knife cleaverly and wildly through the putrid, mountain fog
slicing only discontent and the hope for maybe-one-day's firmament.
The blue-hiemal lake will be broken asunder by ontological impetus.
The masked-complexion of the precipice's compressed view 
retreating back across the glacial black-ghost void, wistfully listless
while the transmuted actualization of future's permanency glamours 
as the flock fleets out of the shrouded valley and rives the palisade.
A new normal of prevailing antiquated ignorance,
where the collective laments the calendar's flip
as the sunset blinds and fosters in their permanent night.
When the sightless are muted and their screams to the heavens silenced,
thereafter all that is left to view is the morning star, the wicked devil of ages,
whose light shines much the same as Sol's before: pure.

When I was 11 for a period of 6 months or so I became intensely depressed with being a boy.
I wanted to wear cute clothes and skirts, I wanted to act girly.

Yet I was a boy, and despite wanting long hair my parents would always cut it.

I didn't tell anyone, because I thought it would pass. Not only that, but I reasoned that I wasn't properly dysphoric, that I was probably just going through some phase or something.

Life went on. Every few months the depression and longing came back. Every time I reasoned I probably wasn't properly dysphoric, and that it would be insulting to trans people if I even tried to come out with these feelings - afterall I felt I still probably wasnt dysphoric, I can't explain why I just thought my situation wasnt dire and actual trans people went through something a lot worse. My phrasing is terrible, I'm sorry, but having never recounted this to someone before it's a little hard to phrase.

At 14 I made a decision. My childhood was gone, I reasoned I was too old and thus would never be able to be brought up as a girl and thus could never fit in as one. Furthermore, the very fact that I felt uncertain about whether I would be able to pass (behavior-wise) seemed to justify to myself that clearly couldn't be dysphoric, otherwise I would know how to act girly. 

I guess to an extent, I couldn't shake the feeling that I would never be a 'real' girl. Anyway, there were 'boy' things I enjoyed too, like climbing trees and video games, so my 14yo self assumed I can't have been right.

I was in the top classes at school and felt like, for whatever reason, that this couldnt be happening to me. That there were other things in my life. That somehow, my path was already decided.

So I tried to ignore it. And for 3 years, until I was 17, it worked.

Well, Im 18. I've never managed to engage or sustain in romantic relationships. The depression and longing comes back every few weeks now and lasts for several days, yet I still can't seem to be convinced I'm dysphoric. I still can't seem to comprehend this is happening to me. That I could be a girl. Even if I was, surely it's too late? I would never fit in? 

Yet still every night I wish I had just been born as one.

I am a 15 year old male and throughout my life, I was fairly certain that I was cis. However, starting a few years ago, my certainty is wavering. Although people outside my mind may not know it, I have wonderings and feelings and perhaps even longings. 

I've wondered for years about what it would be like to be female, not burning desires, but a recurring thought I can't shake loose. I've sometimes gone into my sister's closet and tried on some of her clothes. Sometimes, it's for sexual reasons, but other times, I'll just sit there. Sit there in a dress or yoga pants or perhaps a swimsuit. Just chilling. To my surprise, it was nice to be able to chill in those clothes. I've thought ""maybe I should try crossdressing in public"" or ""maybe I should transition when I'm older"" (no way in h--l I'm even broaching that topic around my parents). or even ""maybe I *should* become a girl"". 

Even though I have these thoughts, I still don't feel as though I am trans. I just brush it off as just me being curious, as is my nature. I still am rather masculine, even though not like what I've come to expect as ""most boys"" (the only kinds of males I know in my school are either hyper-masculine sports-types or politically minded, accelerated classes intellegentsia (I would fall in the latter category)). I still enjoy many traditionally masculine things and eschew traditionally female ones. 

I don't feel like I am supposed to be a female. I don't feel like I already am one that's just trapped in the wrong body. I understand that I am a male, but think perhaps I should be female. If I were any female, I'd certainly be more tomboy than girly girl and I still find females attractive, but maybe I'm just a tomboy lesbian rather than a straight cis male. But maybe I'm not and I just have these strange curiosities.

That's why I'm here. Hopefully, you fine people here at /r/trans can help me figure things out a little. What do you think I am? What should I do about it?
