2019-05-01 03:56:48,bjcv5e,9,8,"I personally grew up on porn.  I am 20 now, and have been regularly consuming porn since the age of probably 8-9.  I found fetish porn shortly thereafter and by around 12(complete guess) I was totally hooked on what they call “sissy porn”.  After dealing with that for a long, long time I started to realize that I felt something much deeper and more significant than just arousal.  As of fairly recently I’ve begun to question my actual gender identity and explore its fluidity.  As in: in real life not just sexually.  

However, I’ve never really “stopped” finding sissy fetishism ‘hot’.  I do realize that there have been great arguments made against the fetish, and it’s ability to dehumanize and objectify femininity as a concept.  Yet, I’m not so sure I agree that is universally true.  And yes, I do like to be objectified and degraded— but that is entirely unrelated to my gender identity.  This fetishism and gender dysmorphia are only correlated for me in so far as sissy fetishism helped me to self examine and reflect upon my real gender and explore feelings which I may have otherwise repressed for longer.  But, this aforementioned correlation does NOT equal causation.  

My gender identity wasn’t made by this pornography, nor are they necessarily and contingently linked in any way.  Further, I am entirely capable of recognizing the vast differences between real womanhood as I want to present it and the womanhood shown in sissy porn.  


So, with the biographical ramblings out of the way, let’s talk about r/TGandSissyRecovery..

This sub likens itself to r/NoFap and claims to be a community that helps people out of their addictions.  Sounds good so far right?  The issue is that the “addiction” they’re trying to cure, at least in practice, sounds an awful-lot like gender dysmorphia.  You can’t be addicted to gender dysmorphia.  

If you can’t stop thinking about being a woman and your birth-assigned gender is making you uncomfortable regularly, those aren’t withdrawals symptoms! Yet they treat them as such, urging people to repress these feelings as much as they can and throw away any girl clothes or makeup they own. 

I used to be a porn addict.  I am managing through recovery with the help of my wonderful girlfriend, and ironically r/NoFap , but that didn’t take away my feelings towards sissy-play nor my gender identity.  At least not any more— I have gone through many cycles of questioning the validity of my possible transness.  In fact, some of these purges stemmed from my being on r/TGandSissyRecovery where i read that the feelings I was having about my gender ‘were actually a part of a conspiracy to get cis men to become addicted to this type of porn.’ (I’m paraphrasing here) 



I guess what I’m curious to hear is:

A: Do you think sissy fetishism is NECESSARILY evil or harmful to femininity? (Keyword being necessarily) 

And 

B: Is what r/TGandSissyRecovery does more, less or equally as harmful to the people who are exploring their gender identities— albeit through less than ideal means?

I’m going to be blunt and what honest thoughts. I’m 17f, but am starting to question my gender identity. I’m not an SJW or snowflake so don’t feel the need to go easy on me. I’m just confused and conflicted with whether or not what I’m dealing with, and wanted thoughts from people who won’t sugar coat things, and people who won’t be like “uwu” and shit. Just want some non special answers. Just real honest to god thoughts. I am not going to act on anything anywhere in the coming times, just want some thoughts on what I’m dealing with. 

I wish I was a dude. Like every day, in every way. If I was reborn and had an option to pick my gender I’d choose male. When I was younger I’d talk about wishing I was a guy. I feel uncomfortable in dresses and feminine clothing. I like makeup to make my features look sharp and angular. I feel uncomfortable and antsy when I look at my body, and wish I was less curvy (I say this from an objective point. I am a very curvy double d girl; people are always telling me how grateful I should be). I even feel more comfortable being regarded as a guy online and frequently choose that option. I want to cut my hair short, no makeup, no boobs, no thing. I just feel like sometimes just like...I don’t know. Like my whole life. Maybe it’s just me not wanting to conform to societal standards for women but I don’t even know at this point. 

I’m obviously very young and very conflicted. I know hormones and shit are crazy, and I am obviously not planning on doing anything rash on an impulse. I just would like some honest thoughts.

2019-05-02 18:45:49,bjyjl5,14,7,"Hi I (17F) have lately been wondering if these feelings might be signs that I am transsexual or just confused...

I know this might sound offensive. I don’t know. I have never felt like this before. So I have no idea how transsexuality works. How you are supposed to feel. But lately I’ve felt like I might be leaning towards transsexuality or just plain confusion.

I have and have always had extreme body dysmorphia. More so in the last 2 years than before. I am very skinny and have always been underweight (up until lately. I have a new dietitian and have finally reached a “healthy” minimum bmi, yay. But im still very frail-looking). Shortly, I’ve never felt home in my body. I’ve never felt like a woman. But lately I don’t even know if it’s just because of my frailness. I was at prom and I didn’t feel like buying dresses. I didn’t put 2 and 2 together up until now that I’m writing this. I thought it was because of my body. I always thought dresses didn’t look good on kind of uh “stick”-bodies like mine. I was dreading trying them on. My mom basically helped me pick one. I picked her favourite because she seemed so happy about it. My friend’s mother said I had gained a lot of “shape” and that in the dress I didn’t look like a stick at all.

When talking to my psych and I showed her pictures, she noticed that I wasnt content. I had spent hours on my make-up. Even gotten my hair done. She asked me what was wrong, why, why I didn’t like the photos. I couldn’t give her a clear answer. I said “I still look like a stick, kind of”. She said it’s not true, and once again asked why. I said I didn’t feel like I got the dress, the hair and preperation that I had invisioned. It didn’t click. It never did. Not even when it all came together.

I’ve always looked at women or girls my age with hips and an ass and just -shape-, and admired them. I still feel like I want to be like them but I don’t know how to explain my desire to also... be male?

I write a lot. And I write a lot about the same male character. I don’t feel like sharing much about him because in a way it feels he is “mine”...? Like he is apart of me. It makes me sick. He’s in the back of my mind when I’m shopping for clothes, when I am talking to people. I have such an admiration for guys I can’t put it to words. I want to be like them. When I see a group of guys walking through the mall I have this sickening desire to either be with one or be one of them.

Which brings me to my next point. I am bisexual, however I’ve always felt more attracted to males. When I have fantasies, they are about two males. Which isn’t strange, I feel. Girls my age ship guys all the time. That’s where it started. But I realize lately it’s been a bit more than should be? I mean, surely those girls don’t somehow “put” themselves in the situation.

I don’t know what to do with this. I feel hopeless. I feel late. Late with realizing. I also feel like I’m making it sound worse than it is. don’t feel like making hastily decisions. Immediately deciding this means I am trans and making decisions I will regret. Like I said, maybe this might also be confusion from never feeling like a woman because of my frail body?

Different pronouns and names feel gross and artificial and everything feels overwhelming, intense and wrong? 

1. The closest people in your life are the ones who you should start with readjusting, not strangers. 
This is the hardest part of pretty much the entire thing. I feel gross to just call myself something else and a different name, especially to my family or close friends. They knew me for so long and now all of a sudden are supposed to call me something else. How can that be acceptable in any way. Am I not just a gross giant men in a dress if I do that. Am I not just playing a persona like a theatre act? Well this is exactly how I felt when I used different pronouns or a different name with strangers without my closest people using it. How did I realise I have to start with my loved ones. After a shit tone of live or die mental breakdowns and crying at friends places for hours and hours repetitively and consistently trying to scream out some sense out of life on which way to go. Reminding myself that I'm literally just another human trashbag being like everyone else on this planet can be pretty exhausting when you start to call yourself a different name. Remind yourself of why you are doing this with all the power the mental torture of transition hasn't knocked out of head. Remind yourself of the beautiful things that will happen in the future once that artificial feeling is over and you feel 100% like yourself again. 

2. Self- acceptance is the absolute hardest part of transition

I know what Im talking about when I say that accepting that you are allowed to live as the different gender is the fucking worst intense part of it all. Going through an Eating Disorder myself and trying to make myself as physically small as possible has taught me that accepting yourself really is a fulltime wall to wall shitshow and easier said than done. It's the reason people decide to transition at 65 when their life is almost over. (or kill themselves during any part of the process). It's a battle within yourself that no-one sees because realistically no-one except you really fucking gives a toss. Is there anyone in your surrounding that can relate to not being able to ""just be your gender""? No? Great, cause then they won't fucking understand what it's like to hate and love yourself for transitioning anyways. They literally just want the best for you and this is when shit's getting really gaggy cause that's when you realise the battle has been within yourself the entire time. Drop it all and allow yourself to be called the other gender. Be nice to people, cause people find it difficult to talk shit about nice people, despite your appearance.

3. Not being able to concentrate on anything else and feeling shit the entire time. 

Within a relatively short period of time you literally adjust to changes that have influence over your entire life until you are dead. Aha moment!  this is why it feels like you're carrying a 50kg bag of existential crisis thoughts and psycadelic drug like emotions around you at all times. Because essentially what you are doing while transitioning is questioning your entire existence. Acknowledge the fact that what you are doing is fucking massive. It's huge. You're fucking insane and you can be so proud of yourself. Acknowledge that, without any judgement, people that are not of this experience have it easier and don't have to completely open up the depths of their psyche. But you know what, you will always have a perspective on life that no-one else has and in a way you can look a little bit further into the insanity of life than your average human being, AGAIN without any judgement or feelings of superiority. If anything, If you allow yourself to think too much about it, the trans experience makes you feel incredibly alienated, lonely and inferior. As traumatized as you may be now, you will find out that everyones value is the same, you are normal like everyone else and even if the people you love will never fully understand the crazy depths of it, acknowledge that they show compassion and support, the same way you would show them compassion and support. Acknowledge that it's okay that this massive gap you opened up within space, that makes life so fragile and raw may be visible for you but not for the majority of your family and friends. And even that doesn't have to be true because even the most tolerated group of people goes through shit that kills them and flips their life around.",trans,Don't feel like shit because you don't know what gender you are.,1556891247.0,"{'created_utc': 1556866047, 'id': 'bk5eoo', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 5, 'selftext': '\nDifferent pronouns and names feel gross and artificial and everything feels overwhelming, intense and wrong? \n\n1.

Every single day, as I browse trans-Reddit, I see the memes over and over again. TERFS suck. TERFS should shut the fuck up. TERFS should die. This is mostly in r/traaaaaaaaaaaaaans and r/transgendercirclejerk, but this post doesn't really fit the standards of either of those subreddits, and I'm assuming there's a fair overlap between this sub and those, so I'm posting here. And, I gotta say, the TERF-bashing has gotten old.

Look, I get the need for venting and catharsis. But I think the obsession we as a community have with the people who hate and fear us is more than a little unhealthy. Do the opinions of people who don't know or understand you and who operate in bad faith really matter all that much that multiple people have to publicly gripe about it *every - single - day*? 

This is part of a broader trend I see within the trans community - this overwhelming focus on the negative. Like that 'Guess I'll die' meme - what the fuck is that? Why do we have a commonly circulated meme about giving up and dying? Why are we cool with this? I could see if it was funny, but it's not. Now that's not to say that there is no place for discussing the negative. The trans experience is rough. We all know this, and these places are perfectly fine for seeking solidarity, soliciting advice, and sometimes just getting some stuff off your chest. This is what they're here for. 

But who, pray tell, do all these 'TERFS SUCK!' posts service? Us? We already know. Is it a slap in the face to TERFS? No. Why would they even be on here to see them? You're preaching to the choir. And frankly, it's a sermon that's long gone stale.

Even if you don't have anyone like that in your meatspace, they're out there. There are tons of supportive allies for the trans community. Where are the memes praising them? I see a few, you know, every now and again. Not nearly as many as the TERF-bashes though. Not a tenth as many.

And maybe, just maybe, instead of vomiting out a constant stream of lazy, recycled memes espousing entirely uncontroversial (within the trans space, anyway) opinions, maybe we should instead be spending our time looking into ourselves and creating original, insightful content that meaningfully adds to the community. Write. Paint. Compose. Draw from your own pain and suffering and make something beautiful from it. Something that will improve the day of people going through their own struggles, and hopefully inspire them to do the same.

What do you do?

My mom continues to treat me as though I'm female despite being 7 years into my transition (FtM).  I'm basically treated as disabled - for being trans.  My bottom surgery was sabotaged with post-op complications caused by caretaket mistreatment, probably so that I'd end up physically disabled (which I was, for over a year and a half), in order to alleviate her financial difficulties through claiming me as a dependent on her tax returns.  

Additionally, I am talked down to, looked at as female, treated as female, and considered disabled despite recovering physically.  Due to the mistreatment, I've been out of work for years, such that I'm struggling to gain autonomy again and am relying on financial support from her to pay bills - thus, continuing the cycle of being stuck as being used as a tax deduction.  

During this time, as a contingency, she requires that I engage in counseling (probably for 'evidence' of being 'disabled' to cover her ass for tax fraud).  It's a coercive situation and my job applications, to gain independencr, are being ignored by employers.

2019-05-05 19:24:52,bl1usc,0,2,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 26 year old male who has been confused about who he is for a very long time. My first sexual experience was with my best friend growing up. We would give each other oral and jerk off together, never any penetration. I remember our moms caught us and we would say whatever we could to get out of being in trouble because two young boys shouldn’t be behaving in that manner (eye roll). Anyway, we stopped all of that when my mother actually caught us in the act of him performing fellatio on me, causing me to run out of the house from shame and guilt. I was in 7th grade when that happened, and that was when we stopped being friends. 

I never had a conversation about it, only when my mother frantically asked me if I was gay and I responded no of course not. In my head I believed it too. Some part me of still doesn’t know what to think. I’ve always been attracted to woman, making love to them, and always had multiple girlfriends. I also would secretly watch trans porn as a teen and knew that something about these woman really attracted me. 

I end up getting addicted to drugs because honestly all of my self confusion would cause me to lash out in different aspects of my life. So I started partying and being the “cool kid” and what not. Eventually try heroin and open up an entirely new can of worms to deal with. 

While I was in addiction I was taken advantage of by someone at a program I was going to. He would give me money, knowing that I was getting high with it. I was naive about the entire situation. One night he invites me over and says let’s have a few beers and I’ll give you the money you asked for. Wanting to use, I agreed, and then was shocked when he grabbed my cock after we walked into his apartment. I pushed him off of me (first gay experience since I was a kid) and asked him what the fuck he was doing. We talk and finally he explains how bad he wants to suck me, so I let it happen. What I wasn’t ready for was how much I was going to enjoy it. And it left me feeling uncertain about myself. 

Fast forward to another program when I’m trying to get off methadone and this older guy there started teaching me about the gay community. He told me he was an otter, and I learned all these different terms and that I was a cub lol. He gave me head and I stroked his cock, and again I felt more satiated than I ever have in my life. We only did that one time, and I actually had a girlfriend at the time. 

A girlfriend who I was with for the past four years after that program who has seen me overcome heroin addiction. As my mind started to clear, I remembered this time I met my first trans woman in Brooklyn, and I was so into her, but she didn’t want anything to do with an inexperienced 21 year old kid. I knew that I wanted to explore these feelings but I had no idea how to do so, especially still dealing with the uncertainty of who I am. 

I decided to explore trans woman working as escorts, simply because I had no idea where else to look. This allowed me to identify that I know what I want. And last night I went on my first REAL date with this amazing girl. She took me to my first gay club and we had such a great time. We danced all night, drank, smoked a little weed when we got back to her place and made love several times. 

It was raining before we got in my car, and I grabbed her and kissed her for the first time in the rain. As cheesy as it sounds, it was the most amazing kiss I’ve ever had. Like fireworks went off. For once I understood what people mean when they say chemistry. 

I drove home in tears because this is the first time in my life I felt comfortable with who I am. Like I’m not living a lie.

2019-05-06 20:51:26,blhi8v,1,1,"Hello r/trans! 

Sorry in advance for the really long post, feel free to skip down to the TLDR if you'd like/

I work in a reference diagnostics laboratory that receives patient samples from hundreds of hospitals all around the country. Hospitals draw blood and mail it to us to perform whatever testing they would like (as long as we offer it), we write up a report with the findings, and the doctor will use the report for diagnostic purposes.

In the type of testing the I run, we see the sex chromosomes of the patient sample (we will find either XX in females or XY in males, and possibly both if the patient had a bone marrow transplant). 

Since we see the sex chromosomes in our testing, sometimes it's very confusing and could look like a lab error/sample mix up occurred if the patient gender or sex provided doesn't match up with the sex chromosomes we see. 

Our lab sends a requisition form to all the hospitals we work with, which asks for all the necessary patient info (DOB, name, sex, diagnosis, tests to be ordered, etc...). Our requisition form doesn't include anywhere to indicate if a patient is transgender. 

Sometimes we will see a patient with a stereo-typically male name (ie ""Steven"") and our form only asks for gender, not sex (which is unfortunately used interchangeable in the healthcare industry). For the gender, they might put female. Once we process the patient sample, we may see male chromosomes. This would lead us to think we had a patient sample mix up, or the patient had a transplant. Before releasing the result of the test, we call the ordering physician to confirm if the patient had a transplant when there was a gender discrepancy. If the doctor says no transplant happened, we have no choice but to release the results as seen. 

Because of this gap, I feel like trans patients are at a disadvantage. There's no way for us as a lab to guarantee we didn't make a mistake when we don't have all the information. Often the doctor doesn't have any information is a patient is trans, either, because the medical records don't even offer it as an option. Sometimes the doctor will ask the patient and get back to us, but I feel like that could put the patient in an annoying spot to constantly have to answer questions that patient could have given an answer to in the first place if someone thought to ask.

**TLDR: When you go to the doctor and fill out patient demographic forms, would you like the option to provide both sex and gender? Would you like to have a ""M to F"" and ""F to M"" option? Do you have any other suggestions/preferences/feedback?**

I really want to bring this issue up to our CEO. Personally, if I put myself in the shoes of a trans person, I think I would feel excluded and confused about how to fill out patient forms. However, I can see how being open about being trans could cause some uncomfortable situations in a scenario in which you came across trans-phobic healthcare providers. I don't want to go off my assumptions alone, so I was curious to know what the trans community would like to see from the healthcare industry, first. 

Thank you so much for your help.

2019-05-06 21:07:43,blhpmy,1,3,"First off:  
I asked the same question in r/NonBinary already, but r/trans doesn't allow crossposts, I hope this is okay - if not I will take it down :)  




Hi, I'm Feu!  
Non-binary, 21 years old, moved out into my own apartment about 4 years ago, working full time, trying very hard to adult my way through life.

I see my parents roughly every 2-3 weeks for a day or two. I don't really have the best relationship with my dad (we tend to fight a lot over nothing), but I absolutely adore my mother.  
She means the world to me and she is a super sweet lady and I really _really_ don't want her to feel bad because of me.

Despite being from a small and conservative village, my family is very accepting - they support me a lot in my transition.

They started calling me by my chosen name immediately after me asking them to (with a lot of slip-ups but they usually just correct themselves most of the time).  
My mum showed me that they had changed my name in their contacts to ""Chosen name (Birth name)"".

Which is making me feel a bit conflicted, I don't particularly hate my birth name - it's just super gendered. Which is also why I don't really want it associated with me...

She told me, that she doesn't want to make me feel guilty, but that she would like to express a feeling she's had ever since I told them my chosen name.  
(And I love this kind of communication - letting people know what you feel, with _them_ knowing that it's not meant to hurt them)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://deemac.bandcamp.com/album/eve-of-destruction](https://deemac.bandcamp.com/album/eve-of-destruction)

&amp;#x200B;

All parts written and performed by me, except for the horns - I composed the parts, then had others play them for me - and the backing vocals on Don't Cry for Me.  


Genre-wise, I'd define it as Acid Jazz, in a similar style to The Brand New Heavies, or early Jamiroquai, with plenty of classic soul and R&amp;B influences in there too. The songs draw from a variety of things, such as my separation from my emotionally manipulative ex, struggles with trying to have children, and of course, my own struggles with being transgender (albeit in a not overtly obvious way).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with my singing voice for a while now, and despite having everything finished except the vocals, since 2017, I've been unable to bring myself to release it. I've been able to develop a very comfortable feminine speaking voice, but singing is another story altogether. My degree was a bachelor of music, majoring in Jazz voice, whilst still in denial, and I'd always thought, seeing as I'm a trained singer, adjusting my voice should come easily for me, as I'm already familiar with most of the typical vocal feminising techniques. This was true for my speaking voice, but it turns out that changing your singing voice is significantly harder.   


I've been through a lot of stages with this album, recording the vocals over and over, trying my best to get them to sound femme. I tried plugins that would alter the timbre of my vocals, by shifting the formants, but they just made me sound robotic. For a long time, I even considered getting in another vocalist to perform the songs. Eventually I came to some kind of acceptance, that while I may one day be able to develop a more femme singing style, right now, this is how I sing, and I should own that, as I am a singer. My voice does still cause me dysphoria, but the other emotional benefits I get from singing FAR outweigh the negatives. While I'm singing, I feel free. It may hurt to listen back and hear a man, but in the moment, during the actual performance, gender stops mattering. 

&amp;#x200B;

From that, I've been trying to reframe my perspective. I may not have the voice I want to have, but it's still my voice, and I want it to be heard. It doesn't matter what it sounds like, it's still a womans voice, because it's my voice. And the songs are about FAR more than how I sound. At the end of the day, it's not about how masculine or feminine I sound, it's about the music.",trans,"Despite dysphoria over my singing voice, I'm releasing this Acid Jazz/Soul/R&amp;B album into the wild.",1557303227.0,"{'created_utc': 1557278027, 'id': 'blz0lt', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 8, 'selftext': ""TL;DR - I'm coming to terms with my singing voice still sounding male, and have decided to just release this album I've been sitting on for the last two years.

I don’t want to offend anyone by using the wrong term and want to make sure I properly articulate how badass this character is, but my vocabulary may be lacking. Would you call this character a trans female, intersex, or something else? From what I understand intersex seems to deal more with reproductive organs where trans doesn’t always include that aspect.

Normally I would just talk about the other excellent aspects of the book that I could speak more knowledgeably about (especially since the information is only revealed in the last few chapters), but as diversity and finding your tribe are huge themes - I wanted to let people know that this book has a kickass character who has found her own tribe and I don’t want to offend people in doing so.

Translation of the video description:

Brazil, due to violence and hatred, the life expectancy of transgender people is only 35 years, half of the expectation of the CGE population. This data is brutal and is the message of the film produced for the LGBTQI + Athos news portal. Young &amp; Rubicam created the campaign and invited the producer FAUNA to develop this film because of their vision under the theme. Based on its methodology, FAUNA sought to set up a team with a speech place to tell this story. At the invitation of the producer, writer Luh Maza - one of the main trans writers in activity in Brazil - joined Uni Corrêa - researcher - to develop together not only this plot, but its nuances. The verses of Forever Young's song Alphaville, which turns 35 in 2019, were interpreted in an unpublished version by the singer Liniker and became the soundtrack of a short film about the love starring Guto and Onika, a real couple and transcentrated.

My beautiful wife was so happy to start HRT, we went the fast route and did it through planned parenthood, here in Florida they will prescribe the estrogen (100mg) and sprionollactone without going through a year of therapy or doctors. After 1 week there were the usual side effects of breast tenderness and a little fatigue. But a week later she broke out into a front and back viral looking rash. We went to the ER, we did nothing, it disappeared in 2 days. She went to a primary care doctor who took blood test and found nothing. They said it was OK to resume HRT because if it was an allergy it wouldn’t take a week to show a reaction. 
Three days later, she had a different kind of rash on both legs (red tiny dots) all over, then came the really bad effects, extreme fatigue,  extreme itchiness, redness at the slightest touch of her skin, she was unable to move off the couch for several days. But her blood tests show she was perfectly fine. No fevers, no sweats. We went to the ER a second time but they had nothing different than the last time. 

So here we are 2 months later, unable to do anything additional because it takes  a month to get an appointment to see specialists. She’s still itchy, fatigued, and her skin turns red if you touch it. We have theories of drug hypersensitivity or something to do with yeast in her stomach having a reaction to the estrogen. 

She’s  so sad and this is a huge setback and a lot more money than we had planned.

&amp;#x200B;

I walk with confidence. I give the happiest smiles. I have clothes that I enjoy wearing. I feel best on sunny days. I style my hair in a way that apparently “suits me”. I have green eyes with the most delicate gold rings around my pupils that my friends find so captivating. I’ve had naturally long eyelashes since birth. The sunshine inspires my face to fill with cute, little freckles. I’m chubby but men find my “booty” attractive— “your best feature,” they say. I’m told that I’m happy. I’m \*told\*.

I feel I look my best when I’ve shaved my legs, gone to the hairdressers, used anti-acne and moisturizing creams like it’s my religion, whitened my teeth, had false nails applied, wore my favourite clothes without breaking any boundaries, and… shaved my face. I get stares when my nails are brightly decorated and my legs are bare. My family (for the most part) are politely quiet if they don’t approve. “Just one of them gay things.” My friends love my “flamboyant” personality. They love taking me to Sephora to get a makeover. I love it too but not for the reasons they think. 

For years, my true soulmate, the sister I share an existence with, the girl I love but wish would go away, sneaks out of her quiet way of being to disrupt my life. I grant her the nighttime to control my dreams and disrupt my sleep when she’s most unhappy.

Publicly being “gay” helps disguise these moments because “all them gays act like they’re girls.” My vessel-sharer screams in my ears, scratches at my arms and body, and just wants to be free. She dreams sweet dreams of being free from me. She hates me, I love her.

I want her to live her life in the light of day but that would mean my extinction. My friends and family would mourn my loss while she attempts to forget that I ever existed. Most of my family would curse her for murdering their son.

2019-05-09 10:14:01,bmhyho,2,5,"**Foreword &amp; Warning**

Incoming wall of text (grab a coffee). No tl;dr (sorry)

This is pretty long, but I wanted to write about my story, so others may find similarities and now they are not alone.

I am not a native spreaker, so please excuse some weird sentences and mistakes :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here we go**

I was born at the beginning of the 80‘s and had a pretty good and caring childhood. I never had any attempts to wear dresses or played with dolls (they creep me out). Albeit I played extensively with my stuffed animals and never liked roughhousing or the like. I was a tame and uncomplicated child. I had rarely forced gendered behaviour onto me, just the occassional big boys don‘t cry, etc.

My friends were mostly girls and I got along better with them, than with the boys.

Sometime around when puberty hit me, I became endulged with the female body and female clothing. I made myself sexy underwear that really aroused me to wear, as I was aroused by the catalogue models (back then, we had no internet).

I liked to wear this underwear and when I was around 15 I bought my first set of female clothing and hid it around the house. My luck with the ladies, was alomst non existant and the only real sexual experience I had was with a boy in my class, who also liked to experiment.

Then my mother found my stash and confronted me about it. „Are you gay? Would you like to be a girl?“ Certainly I said „no“, what else to say. „Good, so you won‘t need these things anymore, right?“

And that is how my first stash got thrown out. This happened again two or three times. After that instead of talking about it we both buried it deep inside us and just recently talked about it where she admitted, that she had no idea how to handle the situation and did not want me to be a girl.

Remind you, that was the mid 90‘s, a very different time for thing like that, and not even gayness was widely accepted.

I do not hold a grudge against her for that, but it would have been a bit easier if she had handled the situation better.

During my time in middle and high school I kept exploring further and mentally linked the wearing of feminine clothing with sexual arousal (typical crossdressing), because I did not allow myself to explore other sides of my femininity. Though I presented mostly timid and calm and behaved in subtle feminine ways, wherever I could; but was not really aware of it.

I got asked very often, I am gay. No I was not, I liked woman and occassionally a men.

By the time I graduated from highschool a lot of my friends came out as gay, but I remained in the closet about my transness and wishes. The advantage of this friends environment was, that I became fairly liberal in my views and judged no one for his or her lifestyle.

My stash grew and I purged it a lot of times, not accepting my feminine side and still linking it to sexual arousal. After an orgasm, I could not get rid of the female clothes fast enough, until the next time i was aroused. Pretty uhealthy, if you ask me.

Some of my friends knew about my habit and just accepted it.

Then came my first great love, my first time sex with a woman when I was 20. Oh boy, did I fell in love. She knew about me wearing womand clothing and was more or less ok with it „I get you naked anyways, so the clothes come of on the end.“ I loved the intimacy and it broke my heart for a long time, and to a certain extend still today, as we broke up and led a on off relationship for 5 years whenever we saw each other a few times a year. Thats a long and sad story of self punishment and breaking heart everytime we parted again.

Since that, I never had a relationship again.

Anyways, I finished my apprenticeship in a big firm and decided to go to college after that.

All the time my stash grew and grew and sometimes I wore fairly androginous clothing, took a nightly walk fully dressed up, but stayed in hiding.

When I was thirty my mental health detoriated and I had a breakdown, not necessarily related to the trans question, but more of a kind „I do not know where I am going with my life, I am desperate, I can not go on anymore, I lack a goal.“

Thats when I had my first therapy, that was more or less useless, but gave me a much needed break and insight. I quit college, or rather was forced to quit and was jobless.

By that time I never wore something else then womens underwear under my „normal clothes“, still linking it to sexualitiy.

Over the next few years I got a new job, that hs its ups and downs but I am still working it. The situation at work became in the last years very uncomfortable, arguing with my boss, coworkers, etc. I fell and fell deeper into depression.

My thoughts about beeing a woman became stronger and stronger, I wished for it to wake up and see a new female body on me. If I could push a button that made me into one, I would push it in an instant.

Then, last year the situation at work got worse and worse. Constant fights, constant mistakes, deep depression, unsatisfied and hating and loathing to get up every morning. It was all a pissing contest, about who is the alpha male and deeply inside me, i despise that male culture of competition and who has the biggest penis (I know that women are not exempt from this).

In this state I went to my GP and said, that I can not go on anymore, that I am shortly before another breakdown. She set me up on Anti-Depressants and for the first time my head felt quiet. I was looking for a therapist and glady found one in short time that helped me immensely to understand my situation better and why I behave in such ways. I mostly made the analyzing myself, but having someone unbiased to talk to is such a bless.

It was in my fifth hour, that I wanted to talk about the crossdressing. I felt it deep in me, that something had to change and boy, I took the fast lane after that.

Draining my bank account I bought a plethora of new womans clothing, banning all male stuff i had. Buying makeup, appling it (I had already practiced a bit while crossdressing). Telling all my friends, that I was trans and had a new name now, came out at work and to my relatives.

The relatives and work was the hardest part, but it felt really good afterwards.  

And I am lucky that everyone I told is very supportive.

The only downside is, tht my therapist told me that she would not feel comfortable to give me the indication, with which I could take further steps into HRT and all those things, because she has no experience with trans people and would feel uncomfortable writing me a „yes, you can“ slip.

Unfortunately there is no informed consent here in Germany, otherise I would have taken that route. That leaves me with looking for a new therapist, which is fairly complicated as the infos for trans people are very, very rare and if you find someone they are already at capacity. This is frustrating.

But I have started with laser hair removal of the beard (because I am a walking rug) and started voice training (Youtube is a good source). I would get paid the hair removal by my insurance if I had the indication, but I could not wait until someone tells me official, what I already know deep in my heart.

I am 38 now, live since three month fulltime as a woman and see now a goal to get to. It helped me immensely with my sanity, albeit I traded gone problems with new ones. But that is ok.

So, why did I write all of this? Firstly I wanted to get my story of my chest, secondly I hope I can give some people that are in the same situation hope, that it can get better, even if you are middle aged :)

2019-05-10 03:41:30,bmthar,1,10,"I have concluded with much discussion with friends and reflection that I likely am a trans boy.  
With a very transphobic family, I will not be able to do anything about it for a long time. Being that I thought I was a lesbian before, I am already prepared to be disowned and all that and accepted it as out of my control.   
But the situation gives me a lot of time to be nervous about this new information about myself.  


Though I feel that being a boy is more like myself, I am afraid of transitioning even when I'd be free to do so. For one, the medical procedures involved intimidate me greatly. Surgery scares me, needles for hrt scare me. And then there is all that might go wrong and horror stories of potential mishaps.   


Then, there are the social changes with changing who I am. I fear my friends seeing me differently as a boy, thinking me strange, etc. I know they would support me because they are all pro lgbt, but even though they support me, will they see me different when I'm not a woman?  


I also have a fear that people might not think I'm cute as a boy (shallow as that might sound.) As a girl, people actually think I'm pretty and to be honest that makes me feel better with self esteem and makes me take care of myself. I was very insecure of my body as a child and getting to the point where I feel pretty was so hard. If someone said something like, ""you were cuter as a girl,"" or that I ""ruined"" my body, I would feel so awful. I am so afraid of that happening.  


I feel oddly alone amongst my trans friends in this. Most I know dislike their body and transitioning is a way to ""glow up"" and be more affirmed of their appearance. It's hard because I do not hate my girl self. I like her, I've spent a long time growing to love her. But I do not feel like she is rightfully, actually me. I feel disconnected from her.   


Thinking of myself as a boy, I feel more whole. Me as a boy is who I feel is rightfully me- But I don't know him yet. What if I don't like him when I meet him? What if people think he's uglier or don't like him as much? Can I really be the me I want to be or will I just be a murky version of him? What if I go through the trouble of transitioning only to dislike the results?   


I'd be happiest as a cute boy. Trans boys I know and see around me are usually more happy in their appearance and body once transitioned, and I agree they look lovely. But what if *I* can't be a cute boy? Should I just ""settle"" as a cute girl?  


And then there is transphobia that I will now have to deal with. Things as simple as going to the bathroom will now be scrutinized for me. It's not entirely foreign since I'd experienced homophobia thinking I was a lesbian- But being a lesbian was easier to hide for me. If I transition, everyone will see and I'm extremely afraid to experience this new danger.  


I feel as though I've opened a can of worms I cannot close. I wish badly that there was a magical way to just turn me into a cis boy without fear or unknowing of what the outcome will be like and also be completely integrated into my life without worry. Is it worth it? Would it be better to just live in quiet distress instead?

I am new here I'm a male and pretty sure I'm 90% low key trans female ( a lesbian i guess )
I will try to make it a short as possible thank you for your patience and time

I went to a therapist last year because of a strong depression but didn't finish my therapy because I lacked money and only met him 2 times and didn't continue with him, sadly I didn't tell him about my doubts of being a trans because I was so afraid

I'm revisiting him next month because the depression is back but I am so afraid and sceptical about telling him about this subject because the main thing that triggered my thoughts is pornography by watching lesbian clips and reading bi/lesbian girls stories (even the lesbian phrase has so much impact on me)
After it I really started to envy beautiful women for being…well, them! Their beautiful faces ,eyes ,hair ( I'm currently trying to prolong it but its bad) , smooth silky skin , feminine body and hips and thighs and butts, feminine chest, beautiful smooth hands and fingers, their beautiful printed nails , their petite beautiful feet and printed toes god they drive me crazy because it a fetish for me,their lovely pheromones, theirs emotions, they're less gross and have less body odors, the power of their bodies, their clothes which they have dense variety of it and pretty much everything i guess, I try to be masculine but it doesn't really work for me.

I really find it hard to tell him all of this beside my other problems in life I'm shy and afraid of his reaction and thoughts of me :( especially i live in an Arabic country where these subjects are taboos and Haram and if he does accept it I don't think I'll tell anybody else because of the mentioned reason my mom will collapse infront of me if I do such thing and my dad oh boy I can't even imagine his reaction because i have 2 mentally disabled siblings and I'm the only hope of the family :( this is so much pressure on me i can barely handle it and I'm not good in life and I chose a wrong Major to study and I'm very depressed about it too

Hormones? Well I don't think so because it will be very expensive and I can't afford it and you guys can't imagine how much bullying I'll receive from my community which Will lead me to suicide and I'm not doing it at the moment because as i said I'm my parents only hope in this miserable life :(

But now I'm starting to wonder about that decision. I was doing pretty good and then I came out to my family and also my dysphoria is hell these days.

So what I'm wondering is how we will be able to tell if I'm unwell because of my depression / mood disorder, or if I'm unwell because of dysphoria.

It feels like it's getting worse and worse, every time I try taking a step towards transition it feels like something pops up that makes me take 2 steps back.

There are no specialists on this topic in my area, so I'm working with doctors who have never dealt with this before.

It really makes me wonder if this will work out in my favour.

I wanted to ask these questions, because I feel upset and concerned about the transgender ideology. I have studied Social Sciences and I am aware of the scientific debate and honestly feel horrified with the current situation. 
I want to point out I have sympathy for individuals and wish them well. I feel sex change should not be forbidden, but surtenly be outside of the medical sphere. 
So the questions I wanted to debate about.

A: Should we transition people without scientific basis?
B: If you believe there is scientific basis, whats the basis? 
C: Do you agree that identity is self observed? 
 

D: In case there is no such thing as Transgenderism, what do you believe should be the future of this sub-culture?

2019-05-14 01:23:52,boc8sp,0,3,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can and my descriptions of upcoming topics to a minimum for brevity, but I cannot make any guarantees to uphold those statements fully as I often feel more detail is needed if I am to seek out a specific answer.  


But first, some backstory.  
I'm fifteen, AFAB, currently identifying with nonbinary, and have overwhelming chest dysphoria. I have identified under the transgender community since I was about 12, as I first realised my dysphoria around the age of 10 or 11, though I lacked the proper vocabulary to describe how I felt until 2016, when I was 12. I used to identify as a ""genderfluid transmale,"" though that short phase quickly ended as I went back to simply calling myself nonbinary/agender, and as I've now evolved transmedicalist views, I repress that part of who I was a few years ago.  


Now that that part's out of the way, here's my real dilemma. With worsening chest dysphoria and a shift in my desire for medical transitioning - I *am* seeking counselling and hope to start estrogen blockers by the end of this year or the start of next year, though money is the main issue - I have found it harder to express myself as someone who is incapable of perceiving gender, psychologically, as that's simply how my views align (they tend to line up pretty closely to Kalvin Garrah's, but that's another topic.) Throughout childhood, I always had a fairly tomboyish gender expression, but of course, that was before dysphoria pushed its way into my life. Now, I present fairly masculinely, while retaining a sense of androgyny due to the fact that my figure is unfortunately extremely feminine as I have yet to begin HRT. My friends and partner use they/them pronouns for me, with a few of them changing it up occasionally with he/him pronouns as I've tried for the past year to test my comfort levels and have given them direct statements that I was okay with it. Being misgendered as a female in public is mentally exhausting to the point where, if it happens enough within one day, I usually find myself breaking down in my bedroom at night over it, and being addressed by strangers in public androgynously or even as a male (if I'm not seen as female, the former has only happened once before, and the ladder is more common) brings me a newfound sense of confidence and gender euphoria.  


When talking to my counsellor, who specialises with LGBT, especially transgender, youth, she seems to understand my issue regarding this, but all the conversation boils down to is ""well, we'll see when we bring HRT to the table and see how things differ then"" type stuff. Within the past couple of months, I've shifted more towards being more and more envious of cis men in ways beyond just having a flat chest and deeper voice - facial hair, a less feminine face, and so forth. On top of that, I've also been experiencing bottom dysphoria in occasional, completely random bouts, even when my top dysphoria was not so bad on days that aligned with bottom dysphoria showing up. I've tried making (and horribly failing) sock packers, which would boost my confidence shortly before it just got physically uncomfortable to wear because of how I wear jeans. I want so badly to know if I'm actually FtM, or if I'm just hypermasculine and nonbinary. The thought of starting HRT makes me excited, yet I know it's probably so far away because while my family's supportive, we've always struggled with money and insurance. The idea of a mastectomy is also one that is almost too overwhelmingly painful to know I have to wait at least three more years because of how bad my top dysphoria is. But, all at the same time, I like retaining my label as an androgynous person, one of who does not have a gender set in stone. It could be because I've used the nonbinary label for the past 3 or so years that I'm so unsure of myself when it comes to my position in the trans community, but I digress.  


I've tried going to AFAB transgender friends, all of who are around my age and in similar situations, for advice, but I got nothing solid. My partner, who's part of the trans community himself, would be the ideal person for me to seek out advice and support from, but trans topics involving heavy detail or mentions of dysphoria make him uncomfortable, so there's not really much else I can do aside from trying to avoid mentioning it around him. It's hard to deal with this in a way that makes me feel truly alone and helpless. If more information is needed, I can provide it. But first and foremost, I'd like to see what the more experienced trans community on Reddit has to say. I feel I am truly stuck between something I truly am or could be, and a version of myself that's so used to the same thing that change would be next to catastrophic. Any advice that could potentially point me in the right direction would help.

Being misgendered as a female in public is mentally exhausting to the point where, if it happens enough within one day, I usually find myself breaking down in my bedroom at night over it, and being addressed by strangers in public androgynously or even as a male (if I\'m not seen as female, the former has only happened once before, and the ladder is more common) brings me a newfound sense of confidence and gender euphoria.  \n\n\nWhen talking to my counsellor, who specialises with LGBT, especially transgender, youth, she seems to understand my issue regarding this, but all the conversation boils down to is ""well, we\'ll see when we bring HRT to the table and see how things differ then"" type stuff. Within the past couple of months, I\'ve shifted more towards being more and more envious of cis men in ways beyond just having a flat chest and deeper voice - facial hair, a less feminine face, and so forth. On top of that, I\'ve also been experiencing bottom dysphoria in occasional, completely random bouts, even when my top dysphoria was not so bad on days that aligned with bottom dysphoria showing up. I\'ve tried making (and horribly failing) sock packers, which would boost my confidence shortly before it just got physically uncomfortable to wear because of how I wear jeans. I want so badly to know if I\'m actually FtM, or if I\'m just hypermasculine and nonbinary. The thought of starting HRT makes me excited, yet I know it\'s probably so far away because while my family\'s supportive, we\'ve always struggled with money and insurance. The idea of a mastectomy is also one that is almost too overwhelmingly painful to know I have to wait at least three more years because of how bad my top dysphoria is. But, all at the same time, I like retaining my label as an androgynous person, one of who does not have a gender set in stone. It could be because I\'ve used the nonbinary label for the past 3 or so years that I\'m so unsure of myself when it comes to my position in the trans community, but I digress.  \n\n\nI\'ve tried going to AFAB transgender friends, all of who are around my age and in similar situations, for advice, but I got nothing solid. My partner, who\'s part of the trans community himself, would be the ideal person for me to seek out advice and support from, but trans topics involving heavy detail or mentions of dysphoria make him uncomfortable, so there\'s not really much else I can do aside from trying to avoid mentioning it around him. It\'s hard to deal with this in a way that makes me feel truly alone and helpless. If more information is needed, I can provide it. But first and foremost, I\'d like to see what the more experienced trans community on Reddit has to say. I feel I am truly stuck between something I truly am or could be, and a version of myself that\'s so used to the same thing that change would be next to catastrophic. Any advice that could potentially point me in the right direction would help.

Recently my friend who is very passionate about trans rights, although isn't trans himself stumbled across a list on Letterboxd - A social media for logging your film watching activity - entitled ""Shitty trans movies that woke cis people like"" The list consisted of Laurence Anyways, Boys Don't Cry, The Danish Girl, amongst several others. 

I seen Boys Don't Cry three years ago now I believe and to this day find it to be an immensely compelling and core shaking film, of what I can only comprehend the trans life must be like. The friend that found the list, knows of my love for this film, as it is a dear favourite of mine but sent in the list, without having seen the film himself and claimed that I was supposed ""woke cis nonsense"" this kind of offended me as this film really resonated with me, for reasons that I can't really define but know.. If that makes any sense. Anyways, he went on about his distaste for it by pointing out the fact that a trans man is played by a woman. Which is a criticism and problematic element of it, that I completely understand and respect where the distaste comes from based on knowing that alone. However, I find it unfair still to claim that I'm being somewhat dogmatic by loving this film, as I find that regardless of the identity of the actor, it's still a phenomenal performance and one that hits very hard. 

Is there any defenses for this or do all of you agree that the film falls in portrayal and quality based on the fact that a trans man is being depicted by a woman? He claimed it to be ""Pretty shitty"" which as said, I understand but dont feel that it's necessarily the end of the argument with it given how compelling most have found the film.

I'll do my best to keep this relatively short, but I have been know to ramble. Anyway -

My oldest child is on the Autism spectrum. They were diagnosed at about four years old with Asperger's. They are now 22 years old and have been struggling with depression and anxiety all of their life. This is pretty typical for folks on the spectrum.

About two years ago , they came out as pansexual to me and my ex-wife. My response was literally ""I am glad you told me, but I don't care who you love as long as you are safe and treat people with caring and respect"".

Roughly a year and a half ago, they started mentioning that they felt like they might want to transition to a female. This was news to me , but I did my best to support what they were saying. I asked why they felt that way and when they started to feel that way , etc. At the time, the first thing they mentioned was how awful and sad and depressed and anxious they felt ALL of the time. They had dropped out of college and stopped taking an interest in things that I know they loved. So I asked that before they got a full head of steam and got too into the transition thing , that they please see a counselor to deal with the anxiety and depression. I deal with those things myself and I know how much of a rotten existence that can be. I just wanted them to know how to deal with that stuff before they threw themselves headlong into something life altering like a transition.

This time last year, my ex wife and I got a divorce. It wasn't good. My youngest kid moved in with his buddies. He's just a regular dude, fighting early adult issues, but has a steady job , going to school , etc. We are very close and remain so. My oldest moved out with their mother and communication became VERY tough. I started to see them once a week...and then once a month...and now I haven't heard from them in almost 7 weeks. I text and call and snap and message, just to see how they are. No calls on my birthday. No visits. Nothing.

So I have since found out that my ex wife is telling folks, I've heard this from multiple sources, that I don't support their transition and THIS is why I am being ghosted. So if she telling other people this, the story I am telling myself is that she is also feeding this to my eldest child.

I just want to talk to my kid and make sure they are ok. I don't want to preach to them or even ask about a counselor or whatever. All I want is to make sure they are doing alright. Fuck man, I lay awake at night and just hope for one text or a message or something. Nothing. I miss them terribly.

Pardon the use of the generic pronouns. I don't know what their current preference is, as we haven't spoken in some time, so I went with they.

2019-05-14 22:08:16,bopaha,3,3,"Hi. I couldn't find the best subreddit to post this, so I thought I would try here. The about didn't really specify that non-trans vs post for advice.

So I identify as cisgender female, and I am in a relationship with a MtF. As a bit of background, my gf is from out of state and doesn't really have any friends here yet. She has large amounts of social anxiety and shuts down in most social situations.

We really only have 1 Trans awareness group in our area. They do a lot of support groups, and we have both been interested in going. However, GF has a lot of hesitation about going because all of the group's would separate us. There is a group for only trans/nb identities to go, and one where only spouses can go. They don't have any support groups we can go to together. 

Which would not be terrible except she is scared to go by herself and has refused to go without me. We also want to be able to find friends together, and other couples to do things with, as well as finding her own friends.

There's also a few members that have expressed that our relationship isn't valid because ""trans people only date in the spectrum"". 

I don't know if I am just being ""gender privileged"" or whatever the term is (let me know if this is the wrong term) but it kind of hurt my feelings. I'm not trying to put myself  in the spectrum, or say I deserve to go to these events because of whatever. And I understand this is what people on the trans spectrum experience every day.

They have an event coming up that is a ""queer trans dance"" and their rules don't say anything about only trans persons being able to come.

So my questions are: Should we try to go to this dance? Should I ask the hosts first? 

Is it acceptable that the line about my relationship not being valid hurt my feelings, or am I being entitled? Is this a normal viewpoint?

What do you suggest we do about moving forward in trying to find new friends in the community, both as just myself/GF, and as a couple?

Please let me know if this is not a post that should be here; or if I have used any wording that is incorrect, or offensive, so I can correct it/learn the right ways.

2019-05-15 02:57:58,bosfnq,0,1,"Hi, all: I'm a 22 year old MTF trans woman in the process of obtaining a sealed name change and gender confirmation. I want to be able to pass to the fullest and anticipate &amp; prevent discrimination/similar nonsense so I can build a safe and happy future.

I had thought sealing the court records of my transition would protect my personal information, but now I have more concerns: future employment in a mostly male field in a particularly trans-unsympathetic state; mandatory disclosure of former aliases on background checks; leaky ""private"" records that have little barrier against abuse.

The DMV in particular is my latest frustration. It seems there is no (legal) way to get a driver's license under my soon-to-be legal name/gender unassociated in record with my current (male) one, which forces me to connect dots that I assume anyone half-motivated could uncover.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/17/dmv-data-safeguarded/24886267/

This goes for other records, too; are future background checks that run my fingerprints (which I've given for an FBI background check) or my SSN going to bring up my birth name associated with old records?

I don't want to be indirectly forced to disclose that I'm trans in order to demonstrate my lack of debt/criminal history, or worse yet be vulnerable to someone who might target poorly secured databases for my readily available personal details. Is there a way to have these records (assigned-at-birth info) locked down via- or post-legal-transition? Somehow umbrella'd under your new legal name? Are there other alternatives for trans folk, or for people with specifically *sealed* name changes?

It really matters to me to be able to decide when/to whom I disclose my identity as trans. I'm lucky to be in a position of passing well, and I'm in a conservative area I don't currently wish to leave for reasons of work/family. Either way, I find it equal parts ridiculous and scary to have personal information so exploitable, especially in a way we could be uniquely vulnerable to.

2019-05-15 11:53:11,bowzeb,9,1,"Hey, I'm 19 AMAB and have been questioning my gender for a few months now. As a kid I was always weirdly naturally feminine, preferred hanging out with girls, would like pretending to be female characters when I was playing imagination games with friends, preferred playing female characters, wanted to wear feminine clothing sometimes and didn't get why I couldn't, etc.. I sort of vaguely had a thought that I might be trans when I was like 14 and then again at like 17 but I didn't think too hard about it, but recently I've come back around to the idea. There's a few things throwing me off though and I've been hella confused for ages.

I don't experience gender dysphoria as such; I experience something that may or may not be tied to dysphoria but it's hard to tell exactly. I developed pretty bad body dysmorphia around the onset of puberty and started feeling depressed, dissociated (like I had no sense of identity and was just existing) etc. but I don't know if that's dysphoria or just standard mental illness. I also get a very happy feeling a lot of the time when I picture myself as the opposite sex that could be gender euphoria, but it could just be some kind of placebo effect that I've been tricking myself into feeling. That's been one of my main doubts.

I've also been sceptical of my motivations recently. The thoughts that I might be trans seem to come and go and vary in intensity; they peaked around January ish and then sort of faded but then came back again recently. I'm currently suspicious that I don't actually like the idea of being a woman and that I actually just like the idea of being trans as it offers an answer to why I'm so depressed/anxious and gives me hope that my mental illness(OCD, depression) could be cured by transitioning. Does that make sense? I'm worried that I might just be clinging onto the idea of being trans as a miracle explanation for my mental issues.

I'm not expecting anyone to decipher what I can't and come up with some diagnosis, but I guess what I'm asking is how can I know if I'm trans?

I’m sure you’ve encountered your share of trans jokes, some funny, some offensive no matter how you look at it. I try to give the benefit of the doubt as
1.) most people I know who make those jokes don’t actually mean it in a bad way
2.) I’m aware being on HRT is making me more prone to anger
3.) I don’t want to be seen as ‘that easily offended trans person’

I’m in a group chat with friends, we all get along very well, they know I’m trans. 1 friend is even in a relationship with a trans person but this is where it gets weird.

Out of the whole group, this friend is the only one who posts trans memes from time to time. Only twice, as far as I have been aware, in fact.

The first time, I got pissed, sad and withdrew to think about my reaction, to examine if it was justified, then talked to my friend. They were genuinely sorry and said they wouldn’t do it again/be more careful.

The second time just happened. It was less offensive than the first joke but still a bit...not quite right. I asked right away if they show these jokes to their trans partner. They said, no definitely not (imo showing the partner the jokes would at least help make a good judgment of if the joke is actually funny or offensive).

Now, I really don’t understand this. If they claim to respect their partner as much as they do, but don’t dare show their trans jokes to them...doesn’t that already show on some level the friend knows the jokes aren’t funny??

Why keep posting them, then? Really?

I hate having to be on my toes, to walk that fine line between being too easily offended and calling people out on bullshit. I know I should leave the group but that’s not really an option for me right now and I’m hoping it’ll blow over as this doesn’t happen a lot.

I am a manager at a hair salon, we are registered LGBT+ Friendly but haven't really done much for the community and very much want to do more! We are thinking of hosting a class we would call In Transition for Pride Month; this class would be focused on people who are in transition and at a loss for how to style or grow out their hair, what makeup would work best for them etc. 

We would like to be a safe space where people can come and ask questions without fear of judgment (especially as we are located in a very conservative area) and we believe this class would be a step in that direction. Every single stylist in our salon is on board for this and we do not hire individuals who are not 100% LGBT+ Friendly because their worldview simply does not jive with the culture we are trying to create.

I would love for you all to share how you feel about this class idea and what it would mean to you, I have no trans people in my life nor have I ever so unfortunately I just don't have any perspective on what being a trans person in America today is like besides what I've seen in the media, I'm hoping you all can help enlighten me and that I can share your knowledge and experiences with my team :)",trans,*Not Trans and know very little about it!* Please let me know how you feel about this...,1558066361.0,"{'created_utc': 1558041161, 'id': 'bpi8e8', 'num_comments': 22, 'score': 28, 'selftext': ""Hello!\n\nI am a manager at a hair salon, we are registered LGBT+ Friendly but haven't really done much for the community and very much want to do more!

So im a straight guy, born male with no intention of reidentifying as female. Cis then, right? Maybe, but then again maybe not.

So, when i see an attractive woman, there are two simultaneous thought paths in my mind. 1) i want to fuck her and 2) i want to *be* her. Okay, not actually steal her identity or nothing, but you get what i mean.

I have a lot of conflicting behaviours. In public, a work etc my behaviour is pretty standard masculine, though sexual banter makes me feel uncomfortable. Dont like to engage with it, dont really want to hear it.
At home with my wife (straight, born female) my behaviour is distinctly feminine. I sashay around, i snuggle, i always want to be the little spoon and so on.

When it comes to clothes, i feel pretty comfortable in either male or female garb. When i was younger and slimmer id dress in drag every halloween- really put the effort in, too. Didnt want to look like a bloke in a dress but an actual woman.

Im quite happy to be man. I like my penis. I like girls. I couldnt even imagine having any surgery. However, if you said to me right now you can 100% turn into a woman, right down to the cellular level id say yes without any hesitation. Well, one hesitation. My wife isnt into girls, so maybe if i was signing up to my next life in advance.

2019-05-18 08:06:50,bq1kct,0,1,"Hi everyone!

So, I am about to finish “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness” by Arundhati Roy and I wanted to ask some questions about it if anyone has read it.

I am not trans (nor cis), so I wasn’t sure if what I was feeling was misplaced or alright. Obviously, people will have differing opinions but I wanted to ask about trans people’s perception of the book.

[MINOR SPOILER]

One of the main characters of this book, Anjum, is a trans woman. Roy has quite a graphic writing style and I felt uncomfortable reading some of the parts in which she described Anjum’s dysphoria. Given that neither she nor I are trans women, I was not sure if either of us were mistaken about something. I wondered if it was actually normal that I feel bad, given how hurtful dysphoria can be. Or whether if her language was just too “shocking” so to say.

If you have read the book, how did you find her description of Anjum, her voice, and her gender confirmation surgery? Did you feel she got some things wrong or were they spot on? Of course it’s probably a mix, so what was right and what was wrong in your opinion?

I personally was a bit offended by her saying Anjum had “two voices” after transitioning, one masculine and the other feminine.

2019-05-18 08:15:31,bq1lvs,2,1,"Worried about chances of getting pregnant which is like the most triggering uncomfortable nightmare for many f2m trans people. I also vented at the end so you can skip that if you want because this whole thing is just gross to me so I'm sure it will be to others.



So to start off I'm trans f2m, and the idea of pregnancy literally has me so dysmorphic I'd rather stab myself in the stomach than go through with it.

The reason I say it's unlikely for me to get pregnant is I may be intersex (I don't have a diagnosis yet) but I don't get a period at all. There's more to it than just that such as I grow facial hair and other things but I don't want to get off subject too much. I've never taken hormone therapy but people who knew me when I was younger (like before puberty finished) have thought I did due to my voice being deeper and having stuble. That's just how I naturally developed though.

To add to that I had a doctor want me to take some form of hormone therapy around 17 or 18 to regulate my body more but I declined because I was looking to be less female, not gain more female hormones.

Ok enough backstory here's what happened:

Just over a month ago I had a condom break right before the guy finished inside me, and of course right away I went to paranoid thoughts of pregnancy.
(Edit: I think we used a spermicide condom but not 100% sure)

Whenever I think about it I notice I feel bloaty or nauseous, but its ONLY if I think about it so idk if I'm just making myself imagine it.

I also had a small amount of spotting appear on toilet paper (one wipe only, not a lot) a few days after the incident which I read can happen when an egg attaches, but this blood spotting was also right after another round of sex that day, so idk if it could have just been from a tear or something as it was shortly after.

I'm going to try getting a pregnancy stick test from somewhere discreet within the next few days most likely, the only reason I hadnt so far was because the idea of having to walk into a store and even speak to a cashier about one makes me feel so shitty due to being trans.

On top of everything I also work in porn and the condom break incident happened with someone I was filming with. Like I don't even know his full name and he's super not my type, even aside from dysmorphia I would never want to accidentally have a child from a stranger I'm not even attracted to or would even be friends with.

When I was younger before I understood sexual health or that my body didnt quite function normally I had lots of unprotected sex with no issues, despite accidental internal finishes more times than I can count. That was from age 16 through 21. If I take my young and dumb track record into consideration I already can see how the chance is pretty low.

But what do you guys think? I will go get a test. I just want some opinions now because I'm stressing and feel totally disgusted.

And I really want to vent about this all tbh. I don't even like vaginal sex and am a dominant gay trans guy in my normal day to day life. I only do the v if its for a film. I'm planning to stop that once I get surgery, because while I didnt mind it at first it grosses me out and I have an extreme resentment for straight men in general due to filming with them and them treating me like a girl. Like as if my persona wasn't an act. Like they know it's literally just for the videos and that it's not my thing. But that doesn't stop straight dudes from thinking me, a dominant gay trans guy would be their girlfriend in real life.

1. I'm seriously not fucking attracted to yall. I like androgynous and feminine guys. Masculine guys especially those with beards make me want to vomit. (Not that there's anything wrong with masculine guys lol I'm just more saying that as a vent at specific ones who think they can somehow make me into them, make me be a girl, and make me submissive. Like no lmfao. Not happening. Ever.)

2. When the condom broke I actually did puke. It was super gross and I made sure it wasnt noticed, basically I just ran into the bathroom and already felt vomit coming up my throat just at the mere thought of someone's cumload being in that area of my body. I spent HOURS in the shower and smothering every external part of my body in hand sanitizer. But God that feeling of having to clean out the cum made me so violently sick to my stomach I can't even think about it now.",trans,Any F2M people have advice?

(Not that there's anything wrong with masculine guys lol I'm just more saying that as a vent at specific ones who think they can somehow make me into them, make me be a girl, and make me submissive. Like no lmfao. Not happening. Ever.)\n\n2. When the condom broke I actually did puke. It was super gross and I made sure it wasnt noticed, basically I just ran into the bathroom and already felt vomit coming up my throat just at the mere thought of someone's cumload being in that area of my body. I spent HOURS in the shower and smothering every external part of my body in hand sanitizer.

&amp;#x200B;

Long before recognizing i was trans, I thought I was a lesbian, so I have already come to sort of accept that it‘s not my fault that I am being disowned and that I have a right to go forth and be happy and live as I want to without hurting anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

But now it’s just the sadness of the fact it has to happen. I don’t wanna live in this environment forever so I know I have to go and leave my family one day. But i’m sort of mourning the death of a future with my parents in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time, i’ve been purposely distant to them because I know I’ll have to say goodbye some day. It’s sort of worked, but as the time to leave grows closer as i become an adult, the reality of it becomes more heavy on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know they’re going to be horrible about it and say I’m so selfish and ungrateful and I’ll never speak to them again.

&amp;#x200B;

So many milestones they’re not gonna be there for. They won’t be there when I graduate, if I get married, if I buy a house, if I die. I feel so hurt because they were supposed to be there for me no matter what. I still love them but I know if their love is conditional, they don’t love me after all.

&amp;#x200B;

I see others who have accepting families and feel really sad that mine can’t be like that. I wish I could change their minds somehow. Even if they were only quasi-accepting and deadnamed me and called me the wrong pronouns and only half tried, at least they wouldn’t abandon me and still let me live in the way I would be happy.

2019-05-20 17:33:13,bqylsr,8,19,"Aight so first off, overall positive experience, for those who are apprehensive to read these 'field reports'. 

This will be a bit of a stream of consciousness, so I'm sorry if it goes long. I don't have a point to this beyond 'what is it like being visibly trans in New England?' This weekend was essentially what I expected, trans stuff wise and is par for the course.

My wife and I attended 'Women's Gravity Weekend' at Highland Mountain Bike Park, which was a beginner / intermediate MTB clinic. Great park, good trails, and all the staff involved were wonderful. The clinic was comprised of mostly New England and Quebec residents.

I pride myself on not doing things that I feel I'm only doing due to being trans. Ex. Weekdays I shave and do makeup for work because personal grooming is important in the workplace. Weekends I skip shaving often and almost never do makeup because if I'm just doing sports or yard work, whats the point, eh? Obviously if I feel like it and WANT to do it, I'll do it, but I refuse to make a habit of it. I add this because I didn't make that much effort to present cis female. I was there to ride, damn it.

So I show up, clearly trans, (7 months HRT) small boobs, feminized facial features, some sparse facial hair, 5'11"", clearly have gone through male puberty, but also pretty reasonably obvious that I'm not a regular cis male.

I walk up to the check in booth and say I'm there for the clinic, no one bats an eye. My voice is so-so, I do not sound like a cis male but it is rather low for a women's voice and not quite there yet speech pattern wise. The instructor is very nice and processes me like normal.

We go outside and stand around waiting for everyone to file in. I test my rental and actually manage to wipe out in the lamest way in front of the group. I yell 'no one saw that!', and people chuckle politely.

We eventually get to our lessons, there's a few 'lets go around the group and say where we're from and what we want to get out of today' type things, so soon everyone had heard my voice, which is worse and more male when I'm out of breath and have a full face helmet on, limiting my jaw articulation.

We do a lot of sitting on our bikes in line waiting for our turn on obstacles, etc. So there's a lot of chitchat amongst the women. I'm included in it with no one acting like it's weird that I'm there.

We go to lunch, I sit with my wife next to a mother and her daughter and shoot the shit with them. Same deal, no one acts like its weird. I kinda feel like people are turning an ear to me trying to figure me out, but in a curious, not 'wtf' kinda way. It helps that my wife is very smooth with slipping in references to me being her wife, calling me she, etc.

After lunch we go for more practice then go for a downhill run as a group. I, in my usual fashion, bite off more than I can chew and eat it. I scrape myself up a little (nasty looking road rash, no debriding, stitches, or skin grafts needed though.) and smash my head, giving myself a mild concussion. One woman pulls ahead to the instructors to report it.

While reporting it, she keeps calling me 'he'... my wife, listening to the report, keeps interjecting 'she!', until eventually 6+ of the group of women are shouting it too. I'm giving the woman the benefit of the doubt that she was just in adrenaline mode and focusing on giving a report.

We go to the medical building, they check me out and release me. I just kinda chill at the lodge while my wife rides. Over the rest of the day and the next women from the group keep calling my name and asking if I am okay and generally just being really nice to me.

We go to our AirBnB, my wife is very nice and takes care of me, which I appreciate but isn't interesting from a trans perspective.

Next day we go out again, I'm taking it easy, do some easy trails and some fundamental practice. I only eat it once doing a jump and I just bail from that pretty well. When I was getting my rental bike for the day the teenage clerk kept calling me 'he', but everyone else in the shop kept correcting him or pointedly calling me 'she'. Honestly the kid sounded like he'd had his fair share of blows to the head over the years. Women from the group again keep checking in, saying they're glad to see us back out there, etc. 

All in all everyone was very nice to me and accepting of me in an explicitly women's only space, and I had a great time.

So I just came out to my religious(catholic) family as trans(mtf), and they were super supportive! A couples weeks prior, I had come out to them as pansexual, again, being super supportive. Over the summer, they agreed to have us start consultations so I could go see a gender therapist and hopefully start HRT. basically I have a couple questions. First, some prior knowledge. I am 15 yro, I never doubted how I felt about being female inside, I never doubted myself on the fact that I want to start HRT and get bottom surgery etc, I am 100% certain about how I feel, and I have known I felt this way since I was young(between 3 and 6). As for my transition, people say I have a more feminine facial structure and bodily structure, so I plan on slowly transitioning, allowing people to eventually call me she/her naturally, and by that point, I'd start correcting people who call me he/him.

1: Based on the given information, how well do you believe consultations would go regarding starting HRT?

2: Approximately how long will I have to wait before I can start HRT(consultations will start summer)

3: What should I expect from HRT? I already know the basics, breast growth, no increased pitch of voice, softening skin.

1. What even is gender? If gender is defined by outward appearances and cultural norms, then why is gender identification so important? 

2. Can the trans community be toxic for men and women? Many trans people tend to embrace stereotypical masculine and feminine traits/outward appearances. Are these decisions enforcing current gender stereotypes and are they simplifying what it is to be a man or woman as simply outward appearances?

3. Is transitioning the correct approach or should cognitive behavioural therapy be tried first? If someone feels uncomfortable  or mismatched with their body, could gender dysmorphia be addressed as an alternative to transitioning?

4. Is transgender always an accurate term? Is transsexual considered a slur? This seems like a more accurate term for someone who alters the appearance through surgical transitioning.

I want to inspire cis people to do some work and become politically motivated to help trans people. That includes participating in marches, rallying at local events where trans people are denied rights, and working to protect trans people in vulnerable situations by standing beside them, walking with them, and doing whatever else is needed.

Before opening this up to cis people I wanted to make sure I am going in the right direction with this. I want to ask what is really needed from cis people, what would be helpful, and how we should go about doing those things. I ask that you give some feedback in this thread as well as posting anything in the sub that you think is important for cis people to learn, to focus on, or to do. Hopefully we can use these things to take up the fight alongside you and help you gain your rights and safety.

I am also looking for moderators. I would like all the initial moderators to be trans people so they can help guide the discussions, add and remove content as appropriate, and ensure this doesn’t become a cis echo chamber. Being a mod for this sub will not be easy. You will likely have to remove many unpleasant comments, and it will take a lot of emotional labor. If you are up for it please contact me.

But I still get dysphoric whenever I see female people/ characters that look close to the body that I have/ had pre-T, and it makes me worry that I actually look like that, or that I will simply start looking like that again just because of that image. As if it was a curse or something.    

It's really annoying, and I also feel like an ass for judging women just because I can't deal with myself. Also, there's a great deal of media that I have trouble with enjoying, because of the female characters that I can't even look at, just because of that nonsense burst of dysphoria.    

It doesn't help that my dysphoria ties in with my OCD. The intruisive thoughts about ""how I'm not even really trans and that I look like lesbian or a girly and how I'm a fraud"" start flaring up, too, which makes working on this issue even more unnecessarily difficult do deal with.

My colon-vaginoplasty revision with Dr. Maurice M. Garcia at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center was successful, it was done on May 13th. The best hospital in the country. But sadly, my ""vagina"" still looks malformed. The gaping open was filled with the colon and I have 7"" of depth, but my ""vagina"" still looks like a wrinkly ball stack. I'm also now unable to reach my clitoris, it won't spread open.

I know what you're thinking, ""Oh, it's probably just inflammation."" Well no, a lot of it has come down, to the point where I see that there will be no fundamental changes in appearance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Myth #1:** *You don't have to dilate.*

Wrong. You still have to dilate, 2 times a day. If not, you will lose depth.

**Myth #2:** *It won't smell like feces.*

Wrong. If you don't douche, it does. You must douche everyday for the rest of your life.

**Myth #3:** *The discharge will eventually stop.*

Wrong. There will always be mucus discharge, which is green to yellow and is slime-like. While it may be true that it will decrease in a matter of years, it will never stop.

**Myth #4:** *The colon-vagina looks natural. You can't see the colon.*

Wrong. The colon is visible. It is dark red and covered in mucus. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have this botched and malformed vagina still, but at least now there's functionality right? I'm fucking done. All I wanted was a functional and pretty vagina. I don't understand how someone can blow off their face with a damn shotgun and get a nice looking face through cosmetic surgery, but yet my case remains hopeless. It's not fair.

I'm starting to show signs of borderline personality disorder and sociopathic personality traits. 

I'm starting to find it difficult to empathize with others. 

I have high functioning autism and I used to be very affectionate, but now the thought of it makes me physically nauseous. 

I'm starting to enjoy inflicting pain on others, it feels good to me. 

Inflicting pain on others so they can feel my pain is the best feeling in the world.

I'm having constant homicidal thoughts about Dr. Satterwhite and my former therapist. I was assured everything would be okay. I was promised. I was told it would be possible to have a pretty and functional vagina. They deceived me and then they abandoned me when they realized they couldn't help me anymore. They deserve to die. 2 years of being disabled and lied to, it makes me very mad to think about how much time was wasted. 

I was handsome as a guy, I had a nice penis size and I enjoyed my sexuality for the most part. But I really wanted to become a girl and I was told it was possible. But it's not possible. It probably never will be. It was all delusion.

I won't make racial comments, but I have plenty to say if I were allowed.

I have so much hatred in my heart now, that doesn't scare me. What scares me is that I realize I'm slowly losing my sanity. But I don't care. I plan on dying and I look forward to it. The thought of my pain finally being over puts me at ease.",trans,UPDATE: Colon-vaginoplasty revision,1558755270.0,"{'created_utc': 1558730070, 'id': 'bslw88', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 5, 'selftext': '*This is an update to my previous posts:* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/apkb4r/honest\\_review\\_of\\_dr\\_thomas\\_satterwhite\\_san/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/apkb4r/honest_review_of_dr_thomas_satterwhite_san/) \n\n*and* \n\n[*https://www.reddit.com/r/depression\\_help/comments/bmr2nt/im\\_probably\\_going\\_to\\_kill\\_myself\\_one\\_day\\_and\\_im/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bmr2nt/im_probably_going_to_kill_myself_one_day_and_im/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy colon-vaginoplasty revision with Dr. Maurice M.

You must douche everyday for the rest of your life.\n\n**Myth #3:** *The discharge will eventually stop.*\n\nWrong. There will always be mucus discharge, which is green to yellow and is slime-like. While it may be true that it will decrease in a matter of years, it will never stop.\n\n**Myth #4:** *The colon-vagina looks natural. You can\'t see the colon.*\n\nWrong. The colon is visible. It is dark red and covered in mucus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have this botched and malformed vagina still, but at least now there\'s functionality right? I\'m fucking done. All I wanted was a functional and pretty vagina. I don\'t understand how someone can blow off their face with a damn shotgun and get a nice looking face through cosmetic surgery, but yet my case remains hopeless. It\'s not fair.\n\nI\'m starting to show signs of borderline personality disorder and sociopathic personality traits. \n\nI\'m starting to find it difficult to empathize with others. \n\nI have high functioning autism and I used to be very affectionate, but now the thought of it makes me physically nauseous. \n\nI\'m starting to enjoy inflicting pain on others, it feels good to me. \n\nInflicting pain on others so they can feel my pain is the best feeling in the world.\n\nI\'m having constant homicidal thoughts about Dr. Satterwhite and my former therapist. I was assured everything would be okay. I was promised. I was told it would be possible to have a pretty and functional vagina. They deceived me and then they abandoned me when they realized they couldn\'t help me anymore. They deserve to die. 2 years of being disabled and lied to, it makes me very mad to think about how much time was wasted. \n\nI was handsome as a guy, I had a nice penis size and I enjoyed my sexuality for the most part. But I really wanted to become a girl and I was told it was possible. But it\'s not possible. It probably never will be. It was all delusion.\n\nI won\'t make racial comments, but I have plenty to say if I were allowed.\n\nI have so much hatred in my heart now, that doesn\'t scare me. What scares me is that I realize I\'m slowly losing my sanity. But I don\'t care. I plan on dying and I look forward to it.

I've been waiting to start HRT for so FUCKING long like honestly. I knew I was trans for a year before I came out. I've always been a tom boy. I started hating girly shit when I started puberty and yea. I always asked to have a pixie cut because it made me look like a guy. I hated having my glasses because they made me look girly. But anyway after 2 long fucking years I can start HRT and I am getting my name legally changed soon :D and starting HRT maybe as soon as June 5th. The name change by the new school year (Takes a bit). I'm so happy I have such a supportive family. I know I'm lucky in the sense that I only had to wait 2 years because some people have to wait way longer. Whether it be because of unsupported families or money issues. It could also be them just not wanting to come out for fear of rejection. Im so so so happy I came out though and that I'm getting help so much already in my transition. I know when I first found out I was trans I thought it would take 4 - 5 years for me to transition (Turn 18) but nope here I am 15 going on 16 in September already transitioning so close to being happy. I know I'm not taking any of this for granted like some do. I know I'm lucky that I got the family I did. Sure my grand parents weren't accepting at first hell they wouldn't talk to me. At gatherings they used my birth name whenever they could. However, now they are turning around and calling me Flea (Childhood nickname) and using they pronouns sometimes he which I think is way better then using she (I use he/him) ugh I can't explain how happy I am :DD. When they said at the doctors yesterday that I could start soon as long as my therapist approves I was jittery with joy.

I am pre-t in every sense. I'm only on birth control currently. I've been waiting to start HRT for so FUCKING long like honestly. I knew I was trans for a year before I came out. I've always been a tom boy. I started hating girly shit when I started puberty and yea. I always asked to have a pixie cut because it made me look like a guy. I hated having my glasses because they made me look girly. But anyway after 2 long fucking years I can start HRT and I am getting my name legally changed soon :D and starting HRT maybe as soon as June 5th. The name change by the new school year (Takes a bit). I'm so happy I have such a supportive family. I know I'm lucky in the sense that I only had to wait 2 years because some people have to wait way longer. Whether it be because of unsupported families or money issues. It could also be them just not wanting to come out for fear of rejection. Im so so so happy I came out though and that I'm getting help so much already in my transition. I know when I first found out I was trans I thought it would take 4 - 5 years for me to transition (Turn 18) but nope here I am 15 going on 16 in September already transitioning so close to being happy. I know I'm not taking any of this for granted like some do. I know I'm lucky that I got the family I did. Sure my grand parents weren't accepting at first hell they wouldn't talk to me. At gatherings they used my birth name whenever they could. However, now they are turning around and calling me Flea (Childhood nickname) and using they pronouns sometimes he which I think is way better then using she (I use he/him) ugh I can't explain how happy I am :DD. When they said at the doctors yesterday that I could start soon as long as my therapist approves I was jittery with joy.

So, I’ll try to explain this as quickly and accurately as I can. I’m 25.

I am AMAB. I think I would have like to be AFAB. But I LOVE having and using my penis, including penetration.

I think if there was a button to become a bio female I would press it, but I don’t think I want to transition because I (myself) will never feel like a “real girl” (this is not to say any of you are not real girls, these are just my own feelings about myself.) It just feels like since my hips are already fused and my shoulders and face are already “manly” that I would always feel bad whenever I looked at a bio woman. Like I’m not enough like a girl. I also don’t think I’d ever have the balls (haha) to get FFS.

2019-05-26 07:40:11,bt5974,3,4,"So as I said, I just want to get this off of my chest, and maybe ask for some advice, so here goes. (MtF)

Ever since I can remember, I've always been pretty feminine for a boy. Even in kindergarten I wanted to play with the girly stuff, and would always get laughed at for being that way which caused me to close those feelings off for a significant part of my life. Now that I'm finally out of high-school and part way through college, I've had these thoughts of not wanting pretty much anything to do with 'manly' stuff (aside from video games since they're too big a part of my life now) and instead, wanting to do more with 'girly' stuff like makeup, dresses, and just relaxing with friends having silly conversations (Yes I know that that's all stereotypical girly stuff, but it's all I can think of at 1:30 in the morning). My biggest problem comes in with my grandparents and aunt. My aunt lives with my grandparents, cleaning the house, making sure meds are taken, that sort of thing. Now, I doubt my grandparents would care that I'm trans, but my aunt? Oh no, I know that she would have nothing to do with me after she learned, and that doesn't surprise me considering how sensitive she is. Like she's the kind of person to get upset at nothing. My grandparents lives are already a nightmare with my aunt living with them, and I don't want to cause any further hell for them in the last decade of their lives from my aunt overreacting and 'banning' me from visiting them. For now, I'm just doing simple things such as having some slightly feminine, but could still be seen as masculine clothing that I'll wear out in public, and then a dress at home for when I'm lounging. As a quick side note, I know that the rest of my family are/would be supportive. For example, my parents and brother are in support, and I know that my uncle (one of many) would be in support, but I'm not telling him yet because he likes to yap his mouth. (Best uncle I have though that I've meet).

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I can do in secret while I wait for my grandparents to die so that they don't have to deal with the hell that my aunt would create? And yes I know that sounds morbid, and no, moving isn't an option because I'm broke. Also, is there an option for hrt that doesn't cost too much money because again... I'm broke...

Realized I was trans when I found a blazer in the woman\'s section of target and my mom wouldn\'t let me get it cause only guys wear blazers, I was upset cause I should get to wear whatever clothes and it became a joke between my friends and I that I would transition to spite her...

2019-05-26 18:45:27,btbiqk,6,6,"In April of this year, I started seeing a gender therapist due to issues with my... gender. I'm 18 and AMAB but ever since I could remember, I've always preferred being a girl and being labelled a girl. For example, whenever I would play in the playground as a child, I would always prefer to be female characters so people would refer to me with a female name and female pronouns. If there was more roleplaying, I would really enjoy being treated as a girl and I remember having dreams of being a girl (even one I can still vividly remember where I remember looking down and seeing a girls school uniform and it just felt *right*). The euphoria I feel from situations like those have prolonged to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was quite in touch with my feminine side before going to secondary school, but as I went to an all-boys school, I learned to repress my femininity in efforts to blend in and not to single myself out as someone who was different which I believe has lead me to become mostly masculine presenting now. Whenever I think of being a girl, I feel a lot happier with myself in those thoughts than I do when I imagine myself in the future as still being a guy.

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing my therapist for a few months and telling him this stuff, he said he's willing to write me a letter to my GP so that I can start the process of being referred to a gender identity clinic in the next couple of years. The waiting lists are too long so I'll probably go to GenderGP to get HRT to hold me over until I get proper treatment from the clinic. However, these past couple weeks have been absolute mayhem. I came out to my grandparents and they were nothing but supportive but I still have my doubts about transitioning. I know in my mind that I would happier as a girl, but the fact I experience little physical dysphoria is really bothering me as I do believe that in order to be truly transgender, you need to have dysphoria.

&amp;#x200B;

The dysphoria I do experience is from my body hair, facial hair, being labelled as a guy and being expected to act masculine. I don't get any genital dysphoria and my chest feels like there should be something there but I wouldn't say it causes me discomfort (Although I really dislike having sex with my shirt off and I prefer to wear a baggy shirt or hoodie). I'm 5'8"" and that did cause me dysphoria until I realised that there are loads of cisgendered girls that are as tall as me, if not taller. I also had shoulder dysphoria until I learned that they really aren't that broad and after comparing them to cis girls' shoulders I found them to be pretty close on average.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my problem is, I just don't know if I want to transition for the right reasons and the fact I don't feel this overwhelming dysphoria like other trans girls really bothers me. I'm constantly going back and forth between whether I am trans or just gender non-conforming and it's really stressing me out to the point where I can't even enjoy anything because everything constantly triggers thoughts of my gender and I just want it to stop.",trans,"I'm so confused,sad and honestly I don't know how much longer I can deal with this.",1558921527.0,"{'created_utc': 1558896327, 'id': 'btbiqk', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'In April of this year, I started seeing a gender therapist due to issues with my... gender.

i'm fully aware that a surgery like this is never going to be cheap and also one should look at quality etc more so than price but of course money is a factor so i'm just looking at options.

2019-05-27 14:05:43,btmcjj,8,18,"Wow, off-my-chest confession time.

**I have to say I've been fucking confused my whole damn life.** I am a biological male, and was bullied a lot for being effeminate, which began in PRESCHOOL. I cried too much for a boy, and my 3rd grade teacher thought I was ""special needs,"" and I think even downgraded me to prove her point. I've gotten teased for girly hand gestures, girly dance moves, girly vocal inflections. By friends, family, the works. I've had friends and acquaintances try to assure me I am gay, I must be in the closet. I had one college ""friend"" who was convinced I was gay, and so proud of her gaydar, she wouldn't drop it for 3 years. (Like, wtf? How would that help anyone?)

My college did a drag show every year, and I did it sophomore year. I had so much fun shopping thrift stores for clothes, shaving my whole body, wearing makeup, styling my long hair, and just being a woman. One of the top 3 happiest moments of my life. And then we went out for sandwiches outside the college bubble. I was like, ""Should I go like this?"" and my friends were like, ""Yeah why not?"" They were super cool, but the guy at the sandwich counter gave me the most disgusted look I've ever seen as I was reaching into my clutch with painted fingernail man-hands. All that pure happiness evaporated and I felt so goddamn ashamed and gross. I didn't do any more drag shows and went back to suppressing it.  

*I don't want anyone to look at me like that, ever.*

For the longest time, I didn't know what I was. Am I genderqueer? Genderfluid? Bigendered? Two spirit? None of these felt like they fit even. I felt like a freak. I felt ashamed to be me.

**And then the SNAPCHAT filter came out.** I don't have snapchat, but I got it exclusively for this purpose, and I was OBSESSED. Oh my god I spent an entire weekend going around taking secret selfies of myself. She looked so happy! So confident! So proud! I don't share them with anyone, it's just for me to figure out who I am. 

It also freaked me out how much I looked like my mom! But, if I really was born female, I would probably look a lot like my mom. I still look like me. And suddenly, my conflicted relationship with my mom makes a lot more sense. While I still consider myself my father's son, I am also my mother's daughter. 

**So what's the deal with me feeling genderqueer?** It's still possible that I am, and just on a week-long female expression high. Time will tell. But right now I think most of what makes me feel male is being raised male in this society. If enough people treat you like a man, you start to think you are a man. (OK ""we-re-not-transphobic-just-speaking-logical"" haters, yes I am a biological male. But the more I seek therapy, the more I self-improve, the more confident I am that I am trans) 

**Maybe I'll transition someday, but right now I'm OK presenting as a male and expressing myself in other ways.** More power to all the MtF heroines out there who are brave enough to transition. Not all women wear high heels and dresses. Also, I kinda don't feel safe to present female, I live in a very conservative area, and I suspect it may cause conflict in my career I'd rather avoid. But I'm happy enough to express it in subtle ways. I'm going to keep my girly gestures and dance moves, and there's an earing I wear that's subtle but helps me express my femininess. And writing stories with female protagonists has always been a wonderful outlet for me.

**And what's more is I'm not just done being ashamed of being me, but I'm starting to feel PROUD.** I can see all the benefits. This duality I've lived with has helped me see things from different perspectives. For example, I can see women's issues and men's issues, and how they intertwine. And being able to do that has helped me listen to others and be kind in non-political conversations and situations. There are some wonderful ADVANTAGES to being this way I didn't consider. 

**So that's it. I'm trans, and for once in my life I'm making some sense to me. Not sure what to do now but just be happy being me.**

2019-05-27 16:18:33,btnw6f,8,5,"Hello r/Trans. I'm sorry to say I've never really been here much before, but this post isn't about me. If anyone knows a better place to crosspost this, I would appreciate that information. The meat of this posting is information gathering and seeking resources.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a gamer. Haven't always been but I really enjoy it, especially when it brings me into contact with new people. About a year ago I made a friend who was a total spaz but whose company I really enjoyed. We weren't super close then, but a few months ago they reached out to me and asked if we could be closer friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

This friend, who eventually told me to call her a certain name but I will just call J, came out to me as trans. She also described and shared her severe depression, especially at the inability to come out to her family or live as her preferred gender. She disclosed that they self-harm and experienced suicidal ideation very frequently. I have talked her through and down a lot of nights where I was very scared I would never hear from her again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with online friends is and helping them is the distance. I am from Texas and J lives in Arkansas. She wrote a very long and distressed message to me this morning telling me she doesn't think she'll make it another week. I feel powerless and don't know what I should say or what to recommend she do. She fears coming out to the family she lives with will be met with resistance, denial, and even removal of access to the outside world if not outright vitriol. She sees no other ways out of her situation, and fears that even if her family does accept her she will never be who she wants because of the stigmas associated with being trans. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping anyone here with any relatable experiences could provide guidance and insight into what I can tell her to bide time while we get her some help. My only ways to contact her are through discord and [battle.net](https://battle.net).

2019-05-27 17:04:50,btoga7,8,4,"Hey guys, I've been on the lookout for a subreddit I feel comfortable asking this to. You guys seem really supportive so I'll ask you. Hear me out, if anything just to ease my anxiety with a ""hey, me too!"" Or even advice. I know this is a bit long but its heavy on my chest. Please tread lightly on my heart.

I'm 22 AFAB and I identify as trans. I prefer male pronouns, I have always disliked anything feminine since I was a kid, have never wanted to bear children, and a bunch of other little things that, looking back, I've realized was kid-me trying desperately to break free from gender constructs. Gets worse when that comes with hitting puberty at 9 and developing extremely fast. 😑

I've had gender dysphoria since I was around 16/17, i just didnt have a name for it. My senior year of high school i came out as trans, and it felt great. I was comfortable in my identity for a year or two, then a hellish night came where I was getting picked on by my significantly older brother and his then-wife. After that, I swore off my identity and tried over compensating being feminine. I started wearing makeup, dresses, tried growing my hair long, or at least keep it feminine. That ""worked"" for a few years. Any dysphoria I'd smash with being extra feminine that day. I outgrew all my mens shorts and never bought more, put all my ties and such in a box, threw out my binders...

And I'm back to being trans again. I never was not trans, but I was desperately trying to be cis. So here I am at 22, more comfortable in my weight, my appearance, my spirituality, my environment, my education, but still struggling with stifled dysphoria. I tried identifying as genderfluid or genderqueer or androgynous or just enby, but the only identity I feel comfortable in is just trans. I dont feel exclusively male, I feel more like a nice blend of male and female both. 

But since I'm trans, I feel like I can only be exclusively male presenting, so the dysphoria has shifted a bit. I bought a new binder, have lovely new mens clothes, I'm back to having a masculine haircut, etc. But I also have a lovely dark, almost gothic dress that I've been itching to wear. But since I'm out as trans again, I feel like I cant wear it. I feel like I'm ""not trans enough"" since i like a couple of the feminine things I picked up in my few years trying to be cis. I feel more like a doll on display of ""this is what it's like to be ftm"" than a human being who is by nature fluid. I feel like now that I'm out, I'm more dysphoria. I'm not out to be ""a real man"" (what a toxic term), I want to be a lovely mix of the masculine and feminine, somewhere on the androgynous spectrum as far as appearance. I want to be a guy, but I dont want to feel uncomfortable in the few feminine things I love too. I say I wouldnt ever shame a masculine-identifying person for wearing a dress out, so why would i hold myself any different? But I get so many ""you're so pretty/cute/beautiful/feminine "" comments that I legitimately want to cry. I want to be seen as a boy wearing a dress, not a girl in boys clothes. So that kills me. 

I took a chance and came out to my mom again and she was really understanding and cool, which I'm blessed for. But I'm feeling still heckin anxious that I'm ""not trans enough"" because I dont necessarily want to change my body and still like some feminine things. I know it's such a cliquey thing to feel. I just am not sure I AM ""trans enough"" to take hormone or get top surgery. But I am ""trans enough"" to feel like an occasionally feminine-presenting dude and prefer male pronouns. I'm so confused, I just need either validation or some help.

And, like i said, trans has been the only label that fits my personal identity. I never feel like a ""girl"" or ""neither"" or ""both,"" I just want to be a dude who wears dresses sometimes but I'm still a dude inside.

I always fantasised about sucking a dick *lol*

She went down the list of contacts to delete the ones that did not pertain to her life. I didn't think much of it. I've been transitioning over the last 2 years (😍👍😍). But I don't pass or ever think I will. But during all this I made contact with makeup specialist and the stores associated with all that comes with makeup. As well as surgeons associated with all things transgender M2F. Her questioning me on makeup (I don't wear any) because I think I look like a dude in makeup. Whole dysphoria trigger subject (sorry if it is for anyone else). That was the first thing questioning me on my direction (wife and I are still working on our relationship) not easy for either of us. So I get defensive for being questioned. She internalize a lot of stuff instead of talking about anything. She will ask me a question that has no good answers. Example: Are you wanting to wear makeup? Why do you think that way? It sets me on a course of self loathing. I'm months away from affirming surgeries. Will this allow me to pass? I don't know (I hope that is the case) Its her resistance to all this that is a road block. Nothing I can do but try and comfort her- slash placate. That's what it feels like anyway.

The other thing that set me off was going down all the contacts with her, just knowing that most of these connections are going to dissolve when I come out. Never mind the anger and resentment of the ignorance I will have to face. Example is one ""friend"" has said stuff like ""chicks w/dicks"" or another one has made fun of a transgender person by talking to me in front of her as an ugly tranny. I don't like to defend her or anyone because of these assholes ignorance. I DO,  ever time. It's not so important to pass. I know this I really do. But at the same time I want to pass or have a more positive look. Not the Mongo looking freak I feel I am. (Not looking for hugs) just making a point.  If I could extricate myself from the tiny minds I definitely would. Unfortunately some, not all are contacts that facilitate a task in my work life.

Today i had a thought i think its worth to work on. It's realy fresh and not full grown. 

How about thinking transition to be analogous to a software edition ""2.0"". In fact it's a new major release. Since we are all born in something like an version 1.0 we decide to do major changes, recode our live and ourself into version 2.0.

&amp;#x200B;

I know, today some devs push releases and major releases multiple times a year, but i can remember times when it was a big milestone when a new major version of a software was released. This was always a process of multiple years with often significant visual and internal changes.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's something similar with starting the own transition.

I am finishing up my Master's degree in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL).  


One thing that has continually troubled me throughout my tenure as a teacher, and in the field of TESOL, is that no one is making any attempts to teach gender non-binary pronouns in ESL classrooms.   


There are likely a number of reasons for this, none of which I feel are valid enough to continue on this way!  


That's where YOU can help!  


I have designed a short (&lt;5-minute-long) survey for trans and non-binary folx to fill out that will bolster my case that it is unacceptable to not teach 3rd-person singular pronouns that are not ""he"" and ""she.""

2019-05-30 06:59:43,buq1yx,4,6,"To clarify, right away; I *am* transgender. I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria officially about two years ago, but had been aware of my condition and angling to pass since I was twelve. It's a journey still ongoing, and although I happily pass most of the time, there's still work to be done. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I just.. *abhor* being labeled as transgender. I have no issue with other transgender people, and I *know* that it's what I am, but I've taken to hiding the fact that I even am transgender in order to avoid being called as such. I isolate myself pretty far from the community because I've never, *ever* been able to just. Identify with it? Sitting in a circle group and sharing my experience as a transgender man with other transgender people is something that makes me horribly uncomfortable, and it comes back to the same reason as before.  


I don't want to be labeled as transgender. I don't want to be known as the trans friend. I barely ever describe myself as transgender, because I don't see it that way; I'm just a boy. A man. When people ask about my gender, I say I'm a man, and that's it. Being called transgender makes me feel like I've been called out, like I'm the token queer of the group, or, even worse, people around me begin to treat me like a girl despite everything I've told them. Despite me passing *easily* as a man. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified that I'm some sort of secret transphobe. I don't interact with other transgender people often, but I've never *hated* them. I admire and respect the community for the acceptance that has been built, and for the progress made. One of my best friends is, also, transgender, and she has no problem labeling herself as such. Gender means nothing to me in relation to other people; this awkward self hatred is my first real struggle with it, outside of the whole, well. Transitioning part. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why it feels this way. I think it might be dysphoria kicking in again, trying to convince me that I'll never be a real man, no matter how much I Try; and my natural reaction, as a spiteful little gremlin, is to oppose that as strongly as possible. Even if it means cutting myself off from what I technically am, apparently.   


I don't know what I'll get out of posting this. I think I just want to feel less alone. If anyone has advice, or the same experience or anything, please comment.

2019-05-31 10:26:40,bv5u88,0,2,"So I was curious exactly how uncommon it is to uh... be a virgin at 22 because you hated your body so much you wouldn't let anyone touch or see it? Like, I see a lot of trans people like ""Oh I used to have tons of sex when I thought I was gay"" or whatever and I just physically couldn't do it, I haven't even been shirtless since I was 6 going swimming.

Similarly, I kinda forced myself into isolation to stay closeted, I only made 2 friends who aren't my brother because I literally couldn't help myself. I guess I'm secretly extroverted, which kinda makes sense. Anyway, I didn't wanna get close to people and be found out, I thought I'd either run away from home and transition or commit s**cide by 16, and neither of those happened.

Will I ever be pretty? I see so many attractive women, and my heart sinks because I've only seen a man in my reflection no matter how hard I try, and it's especially frustrating to see the few girls who completely pass pre-everything like I am. I know it's vain to think beauty matters so much, but I would sell my soul in an instant if it made me pretty.

Oh, and uh, how the hell do I ask for hormones? Like, my plan is to just go and see if the OKC Planned Parenthood does informed consent, since I finally have spare money for once, but I'm terrified to just ask outright, especially since I'd probably get shot on my way over trying to present feminine and very obviously failing, I feel like they'd constantly second guess me because of my baby biker appearance. I say ""baby biker"" because I go around in a sorta biker getup, but I am neither big nor burly and do not possess a beard or drink alcohol.
