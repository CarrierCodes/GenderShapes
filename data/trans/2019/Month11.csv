I seriously thought that Reddit was smarter than this.

SO, I started replying to the comments with an entire thesis’ worth of information. I’m a trans researcher, a legit subject matter expert on binding and tucking. I attend and am invited to attend conferences and talk about this stuff. I’m also a youth advisor from trans and gender non-conforming youth. I know my shit. I have to. It’s my job. So when I talk about how 10-20 years ago there weren’t as many regulations or as much available research in doctors hands, so that’s why we hear about a few people put on medical tracks that ended in a transition they now regret; when I talk about HOW RARE THOSE CASES ARE; how drag is just a form of performance or dance, like ballet, jazz, or theatre; when I talk about how difficult it is for the youth I work with, who are 16-18 to get hormones, even WITH their parent’s support; when I talk about my expertise; when I mention that there are REAL threats to trans kids safety unrelated to medical transitioning (unsafe binding, stress, bullying, you idiots on the internet spreading false information); when I  s p e l l  it out for them... there are more people around the corner with the same dumb shit!

I’m not sure if this is a good place for this but I’m really just looking for advice. I have a younger brother. When he started 8th grade he began to start to become friends with a lot of LGBTQ+ artsy girls. He’s never been much into girls so I had suspected he might have been gay for awhile. A month or so ago he came out as Gender Non-binary and Pansexual. He wanted to use they/them pronouns and change his name (from a very gender neutral birth name) to Serge (after some YouTuber [?]). He dyed his hair black and got his ears pierced with studs. My parents don’t care how he wants to express himself but weren’t keen on the pronouns and name thing. More recently, he decided to come out again as Trans and change his pronouns to she/her and name to Sage.. He’s been having my mom buy him women’s clothing  (like jeans and hoodies, nothing too “girly”) recently but she still isn’t into the pronoun/name change. My Dad, on the other hand, thinks he doesn’t know what he is and just wants to fit in with his friends. As for me, I’m really just confused about what to think at all. I’m getting conflicting sides and angles from people and the internet. It’s very hard for me at the moment to change his pronouns/name because in my heart I know him as my brother and by his birth name. I know that some people don’t realize they are trans until later, but he was never one to wear girls clothing or want anything to do with “girly” things as a child. Obviously I know that not all girls are like that but It just makes it more confusing for me. This all started happening when he started hanging out with his new friends and I do wonder in the back of my mind if he is really just trying to fit in with them. He won’t talk to me (or any family for that matter) about it much. When I try to ask questions(politely) he just blows me off. He’s never been very nice to me but he’s gotten way more grouchy all the time nowadays. He stays at school late with his friends, comes home and hides in his room, and barely talks to me. When he does talk to me it’s normally yelling over absolutely nothing. I’ve heard stories of people being able to express their identities and immediately being happier but all this has seemed to do is make him more grumpy and irritable. I just need help knowing how I should proceed and what I should do? Should I try talking to him about it more? If so, how? I know it’s not my place to say how he feels, gender wise, but how do I know that he actually feels this way and isn’t just trying to get attention and fit in with his friends? How can he expect my parents and I to just accept that without being able to talk about it or ask questions? If this actually gets replies, please be nice and civil.

2019-11-01 19:16:06,dq8viw,0,1,"hey everyone! I’m Mars and I’m currently learning to accept and love myself. I just wanted to share something on here and see if anyone else has experienced this or something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

basically, I’m 18 years old and was assigned F at birth, my whole life I’ve been obnoxiously straight and femme, mostly because whenever I’d be more “myself” people would tease me and call me a dyke or other mean names. for example, I would dress up as the hulk and when my friends and family would say that I’m not a boy and I can’t be the hulk I would do a 180 and become obsessed with princesses.

&amp;#x200B;

 I’ve always wished that I could be a boy but didn’t really know what that meant, so at school when I was 6 I would feel out of place when put in the girls team or when using the girls bathroom. Even in my dreams, I was never a girl, I was always a boy. I would look at guys playing and wish I could be them. But I was taught that my desire to be them was just a crush. So for years I went on buying the frilliest things, hoping to please my mom or my friends. I remember the time that I was the most like myself I got called a boy and my friends’ reactions made me feel so guilty for being “misgendered”, even though I weirdly liked it. so after that I would try and try to fit this image of a girl. And at some points I liked it. I liked the idea of having a girly room and wardrobe, but even though I liked the idea, I didn’t identify with those things. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in 2015 ish I remember watching part of a movie that my mom was watching about a trans man, and I remember thinking “wow I’m glad I’m a woman, I’m so happy to be a woman, I wouldn’t be able to be happy if I was a man”, but as soon as I thought that I began picturing what it would be like if I was a man, and it just felt so natural. But I immediately told myself “nope, I would hate to be a boy” 

&amp;#x200B;

From 2015-2018 I didn’t really get a chance to explore my gender identity because I was battling a severe chronic illness and barely had the strength to keep up with school, and the times where I did feel dysphoria and felt like ripping off my boobs I wrote it off, because “I loved being a girl”.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in the beginning of 2019 I started to accept myself as bisexual, which was already really difficult because I had already engrained this picture of myself as a cishet woman in my mind. And more recently, I’ve been feeling more and more dysphoria, and when it got to the point of me googling things like “why do I hate my boobs?”, “wanting to get rid of boobs”, “I hate being a woman”. And when all the results pointed towards trans websites and forums my immediate reaction was “oh ok, but I’m obviously not trans”, not for any particular reason but I just knew I wasn’t trans. I had planted my cisgenderness so far into my mind that it was like a law that I was trying to question. I felt so guilty and weird when I started thinking that I might be trans, because “I’m happy being a girl”, “look at my room, it’s girly”, “I love dresses”, “I’ve always been happy being a girl”. But it’s gotten to a point where I don’t think that’s enough of a reason to not be trans. I love pretty dresses, but I don’t want to wear them, cute pink girly rooms are aesthetically pleasing, but I don’t want one. And as dumb as it sounds it feels like I’m erasing an image I had created for myself. And that makes me feel like I’m faking this or it’s a phase. 

&amp;#x200B;

Deep down I’ve always known that I wasn’t a woman, so much so that I told myself from a young age that I wasn’t trans, I didn’t say that I am a woman, but I would just reassure myself that I am not trans and I was born a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I’m sorry for this ridiculously long post, I guess this is just the first time I’m getting this all off my chest. I also considered that I could be non binary but that also doesn’t feel right. My biggest fear is just that I look at my past self covered in the girliest stuff and think, “what if I want be girly again? What if I miss it?” But I never liked it to begin with. I was just forcing myself to be someone I’m not and I’m slowly learning to allow myself to be me. And it’s really difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this and feel free to tell me if I’m just going through a phase or if this sounds like what you experienced. I just wanted to share my pain, even if it’s online.

2019-11-01 23:44:13,dqch39,27,6,"Hello everyone, 

Cis male here with a question for the trans community. I have no trans friends to pose this question to and so I came here. I was recently permanently banned from the r/blackpeopletwitter subreddit for casually using the term “tranny” in a post because it was deemed an offensive slur. 

Full disclosure: the comment was a response to a word combination post regarding the “rapper” Drake. I said “drake is TRAsh and corNY... Tranny.” It can be seen here on another post I made about it in the r/banned subreddit: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/dpx7fe/have_said_and_been_called_the_n_word_multiple/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf


It was tasteless and was more a comment on my dislike of Drakes music and calling attention to the sort of pansexual air that he exudes, rather than aimed at the trans community, but I see how it could be taken as a dig at them. 

I’m old and admittedly ignorant, but when I was coming up, I always thought it was a shorthand for transvestites (crossdressers) only and not a term aimed at all groups that self identify as some sort of trans. And I never considered it might be a slur at all. 

So the question is, is it really a slur? Is this just cis activists being pissed off for a community that they aren’t even a part of? Google has conflicting answers. 

Downvotes are fine. I know this community is a place for everyone to come and not have to deal with cis ignorance, but I just really would like to know if my way of thinking on this is flawed and hurtful so I can correct it.

Tranny.” It can be seen here on another post I made about it in the r/banned subreddit: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/dpx7fe/have_said_and_been_called_the_n_word_multiple/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nIt was tasteless and was more a comment on my dislike of Drakes music and calling attention to the sort of pansexual air that he exudes, rather than aimed at the trans community, but I see how it could be taken as a dig at them. \n\nI’m old and admittedly ignorant, but when I was coming up, I always thought it was a shorthand for transvestites (crossdressers) only and not a term aimed at all groups that self identify as some sort of trans. And I never considered it might be a slur at all. \n\nSo the question is, is it really a slur? Is this just cis activists being pissed off for a community that they aren’t even a part of? Google has conflicting answers. \n\nDownvotes are fine. I know this community is a place for everyone to come and not have to deal with cis ignorance, but I just really would like to know if my way of thinking on this is flawed and hurtful so I can correct it. \n\nThanks for your time and any responses', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Is “tranny” offensive?', 'created': 1572677053.0}"

I’m not a bad looking guy but I can never get with girls that are super attractive and alpha and that I’m super attracted to. The escort I just met for, wait for it.... 20 mins. Was so unbelievably beautiful. Most beautiful girl I’ve ever been with.. she was about 5’10. Brown skin. Smooth skin. Amazing lips and personality. Clearly intelligent. Amazing legs. She worked out obviously. Then her cock. As I was sucking it and she was moaning “yesss that’s it” and I felt her grow in my mouth and then my throat. It just kept growing in every direction. Before I knew it I was being throat fucked. I never thought I’d be able to do that but it was all the way in my throat and she was fucking me. She then lay down and I kept sucking her cock which was completely shaven. She looked incredible on the bed. Her hair was so soft and long. No surgery on her face totally natural but omg her lips. She smelled incredible. Her tits were amazinggggggg. The perfect size and so convincing. Her cock continued to get bigger and I continued to get throat fucked... honestly it was huge yet felt so amazing in my throat and she was loving it. Her moans and energy were incredible. She then asked “do you want me to fuck you”, when I said yes, she stood up, quickly squirted lube on her fingers, covered my ass hole with it and slid her she cock inside me. She fucked me really hard and fast and deep. She then put both feet on the bed and fucked me like a dog saying she was going to cum. She climaxed inside me, bareback, no condom, I felt her hot load inside me and I felt her huge cock throb inside me for about 20 seconds. She pulled out and cleaned herself while loads of hot creamy cum was pouring out of me as I finished myself off. Before she finished cleaning up I came and it shot so far it hit the back wall. I cleaned up, she let another client into the other room, then she showed me the door and I left. All in about 20 minutes. I can’t get over how beautiful she was. I feel like that is the only way I can be with girls that I’m super attracted to. I’ve been with 1 female escort before and it was horrible, she stank of shit and was clearly high. This is the third transgender escort I’ve been with and they have all been nice and taken the whole thing quite seriously and with professionalism. She was so beautiful.

2019-11-02 01:40:56,dqduav,1,3,"I don't really know what I expect to get out of writing this, I don't really know that I have *any* expectations to be honest. I think I just need to get it off my chest, and when there's a 6 month waiting list for therapy, this is about as good as it gets for offloading the emotional baggage I suppose.

I don't know how so many of my brother's make this all seem so *easy*.. take, for example, my best friend. 28, been on T for 2 years, knows without a shred of doubt that he is a man.. always has been.. and you can kinda see it in his photos from life before his transition. He just did it, woke up one day and decided that was the day he was going to set his transition in motion and never looked back. He tells me all the time that I just need to be true to myself and forget what others think and while that is a beautiful notion in theory, it's just *NOT* that easy for me.

Say I did stop caring about what others think, great, I can just be true to me and not care about how that affects others around me... But that still requires me knowing who the &amp;@$# I am... It requires me being certain that *this* is who I am, that I am 100% sure that I am meant to transition. I don't know who I am. I don't *know* I'm a man, I'm 25 years old and until I was 23 I hadn't even *considered* the fact that something was different. I knew I was gay from the age of about 14 but trans? It hadn't ever crossed my mind.

Then factor in the thought of disappointing my parents.. forget everyone else, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but them? They're my life line.  Ever since I was little, I looked at my father and thought *""that, that is what a good man looks like""* I won't say I always wanted to be like him, cause I don't know that I did.. i remember when I was little I wanted to be a stay at home mom, have a husband just like my father and live a life that would make him proud. I wanted to do things he did, sure, but I don't think I ever really wanted to be a husband or anything when I was little.. I always dreamed of him walking me down the isle some day, having him bond with the person I'd marry.. and now, now that I've been questioning all of this gender stuff, I can't help but feel like I'd be robbing him of his little girl by transitioning.

I know I'm not who he dreamed I would be, none of us are really.. but the thought of disappointing him.. of making him mourn the little girl he spent so many nights rocking to sleep.. it breaks my heart. He's a good man. A great man. And I'd be lucky to be half the man he is.. but the thought of letting him down like that almost stops me in my tracks. 

My parents are old school, not rude, but not exactly progressive either.. they don't understand why so many people are coming out these days, and have openly admitted that they believe it's due to a millenial need to be a part of something special.. like by being trans, youth feel that they belong to a group or something. They basically support the notion that trenders are a very real thing and that lgbt awareness and involvement has become a social issue. That people are too quick to say I'm this or I'm that just to try and fit in.. and I can't blame them for the way they view the world, they were raised in a different time.. things have changed so much in their lifetime and accepting things they don't understand can be difficult. I get that. But it's also made it abundantly clear that they do not support the idea of people being openly trans. Which scares me. Because not only do I run the risk of making them mourn their daughter by transitioning but I also run the risk of them never truly accepting me as their son either.

I don't know if I'm trans or not, and maybe I'll never know for sure, but the thought of pushing them away.. the thought of losing the relationship we have.. it's terrifying. Even if I did know for sure.. I'm not sure I have it in me to transition and run the risk of losing them from my life. 

I just wish I could go back to being ignorant to the whole thing.. be blissfully unaware of any of it. I want this to all just go away.

 I really need an advice from all of you. Since I was a teenager, I always hated myself but I didn't know the reason why. All I knew was that every time I was dressing up with my friends to go out, I always envied them. They could wear bras, panties, really tight jeans and heels and I had to dress up like ""the normal guy"" society expects you to be (note that by that time I was heavily repressed to the point I would think that a guy doesn't have to dress up with clothes for ""girls"").

 Nowadays I'm 20 years old and discovered that I feel myself comfortable with being gender fluid, but I tend to express  more my female identity rather than the male one. 

Anyways, I have talked to my friends a lot, and I always tell them how if I were born with the female genitals, I would be the happiest woman alive, whereas I encounter myself right now scared the fuck out because I know I am transgender, I don't feel comfortable right now on my own skin, but I'm really scared of starting the hormone therapy and have the sex reassignment therapy done and say ""okay, this is not what I expected"" and end up hating myself even more for the rest of my life.

2019-11-06 18:21:15,dskb4k,2,3,"Has anyone here/anyone you know ever wanted to transition, not been able to for whatever reason, and then ended up feeling comfortable enough to accept your current form anyway?  I've had that experience, which my younger self would never believe, as I'd always wanted to have a full sex change for a long time.

When I was still in the womb, I was male, as they did a scan early on in my mum's pregnancy.  However, by the time I was born, I'd somehow physically changed during development and become female, and the doctors were astounded.  Despite the fact that I never knew this for a long time, I've always felt like a boy.  I never really enjoyed the same girl-oriented toys, products, etc that other girls did, and I hated how my mum dressed me up in frilly dresses.  Quite early on, I demanded to be able to choose my own clothes, and thankfully my mum didn't mind.  Never wore a skirt or dress again until I was way into adulthood.  I also asked for my hair to be cut really short.  People always said I was tomboyish, but that didn't sound right to me, as I genuinely just felt as though I was a boy naturally, not that I was just acting like one.  It got even more suggestive of that when I was 14, as by that point, I'd realised that I was attracted to girls.  By 15, I'd explored sexuality with girls and fully believed that I was a straight man, not a gay woman.  I hated puberty for making my female body unavoidable for me, and at that point, I decided I wanted to have a sex change as soon as I was old enough.

However, I had a lot of bad experiences between ages 16-19 that included abuse and rape by men, I'm sorry to say.  This kinda distracted me from my personal goals and things like that, and I just sort of coasted by for many years after that in a depression, knowing that I was old enough to do what I wanted now, but so depressed that I just didn't have the motivation to start such a large upheaval of my life.  I had a bad time for quite a while, but then, around age 24, I started to come out of it and feel better about things.  I'd also had a long break from sex with anyone, and had spent time getting to know myself properly and exploring the possibility of dressing in women's clothes and my adult feelings towards my birth gender, now that I had grown a lot from the child I was before.  Through having a good sexual experience with a man (for once) and finding that there were things about femininity that I did enjoy, I sort of realised that I'd come around to the idea of staying physically female and just enjoying gender exploration in my image and personality.

Nowadays, I don't really mind that I have a girl's body, as I've learnt that I can still feel comfortable with members of both sexes in the bedroom, and if anything, I enjoy playing with my image - I can be very boyish one day, ultra-girly the next, and somewhere in the androgynous middle another day.  It's quite fun.  I have to be honest, whenever I wear dresses and feminine clothing, I do feel like a man in drag, but I don't mind that, as dressing in drag can be fun, no?  I think I just became comfortable enough with myself as a person that I didn't care quite as much about what gender my body was.  If I had got a sex change, I don't think I'd regret it, but at the same time, I'm no longer pining to have one.  I think I'm just comfortable with things not being as I'd originally hoped for.

That said, I know from my trans friend that realizing a name is an important part of the gender transition and I would be supportive of that as well.

So I guess this is a general question that I did not want to post on r/askreddit, but if you had a gender-neutral name pre-transition, would you keep it post-transition?

They took this very seriously, contacted a lawyer that deals with EO policy updates to consult with, and write the new policy. So today the head of HR called me into his office and we discussed the roll-out plan as well as run everything they wanted to do past me to make sure I was comfortable with how they were proceeding. Frankly, I was blown away with the professionalism and sensitivity they showed me.

So the plan is that on Tuesday the CEO will release the new EO policy to the company then on Thursday they'll send out a company wide email announcing my transition (not an issue since everyone already knows by now and are all super awesome about it). Finally, around the new year they'll do some official training for the policy that the whole company will have to sign off on to confirm they took it.

2019-11-08 23:18:55,dtno65,5,1,"Oh boy this is going to be long.

I told her I might be trans. She was surprised, I told her I was surprised too. She said whatever I do is fine. It went fine, overall, very chill. I just wish I could know for myself. On Monday, I was writing something for English where the main character was trans, and after the character had a bit of an emotional breakdown, I was just like ""wait that's just me isn't it."" So, I had a bit of a crisis as well. It went fine. I wrote some stuff about myself and how confused I am. For a bit I thought I was most likely a trans woman. Then I went through the rest of the week, thinking about it constantly. My reccomended was flooded with trans content, I found this subreddit, I considered the logistics of various things I hadn't thought of. It's been weird. From Tuesday to Thursday, while I was thinking about it a lot, I started thinking that I probably wasn't trans. And then, late last night, I realized there was a good chance I was an egg, and if I was, I was currently in the process of cracking. And I was convinced I did. I thought I had come to an at least mostly conclusive decision I was trans, and resolved to come out bu the end of today. And then, as the day passed, I wavered again. But, I consider myself to be on good terms with my past self, and if he really wanted this, and felt he needed to tell our parents how he was feeling, I wasn't going to change my mind. So I came out, it was very casual, I was trying to be a little goofy about it, to show I'm not too distraught or that they need to worry themselves too much over this. And yeah. Now it's now.

So that's what happened over my week, I guess this next part is going to more of my internal thoughts and musings.

So, I've thought about this more lightly before this Monday, and the conclusion I came to when I did was that I don't really have a naturally strong sense of gender identity, so I just latched myself onto what was easiest and I was most used to, my biological sex. And I was happy with this conclusion for a while. Then, the English assignment came along. I didn't write a trans character because I was feeling this way, I started writing it, which got me thinking about this more and more. She was a trans girl in the 1910s (Didn't want to do historical fiction, but that was the assignment.) I knew it would be hard, I knew that I a cis boy, couldn't really understand the experiences and feelings of a trans girl. But, knowing I had thought about this and had questions about it, thought I could just have her sort of think about the same things I did, and have the same kinds of questions, and everything would be the same up until she concluded she's a girl where I concluded I was a boy. You know what they say, if you don't know how to write a character, just make them an exact copy of yourself.  There was something I noticed here. Why was it easier for me to write a trans girl than a trans boy? You'd think, identifying as male, I could just write someone like me, who was born with a vagina. My brother pointed this out too, and all I could think of was ""yeah that is weird."" This was when things really kicked off. I've thought about if I would like to be a girl. And the answer is... kind of? I think it could be nice, honestly. It would just kind of feel nice to slip into she/her pronouns, and feminine clothing, and boobs. But on the other hand, I don't really have any problems with my current gender. I'm alright, i consider myself a visually decent young man. I come on here and I see people who are moving past the life that was expected of them, showing and being proud of their true self. And I'm so happy for them, I really am. But I don't resent my current pronouns, or name, or penis. But I think it could be really nice to grow up and mature into a lovely young lady. And on the third hand, *it's so hard.* transitioning is not easy. Explaining it to people can be uncomfortable, medically transitioning comes with puberty 2, and sometimes painful surgery, if that's what you want to do, and I have *no pain tolerance.* And no matter what you do, you are always gonna get shit for it. And I don't really want to have to deal with all that, I just want to sit around at home and play kingdom hearts. I don't get the feeling other people get of being trapped in their own skin, or only ever feeling that they could have been the way they are. I'm just kind of, to put it lightly, envious of lady-skin. But I also like my skin. All skin is good. And on the fourth hand, if you think about it, what even really is my problem? I'm not trans enough? I'm too okay with my assigned gender? I'm not dysphoric enough? The more I think about it, the more my problem seems like a bullshit non-problem and I'm just complaining about nothing while real trans people are out there suffering real problems, so I just get mad at myself for feeling this way. And on the fifth hand, I get mad at myself for feeling that way because invalidating myself and my problems is not right and just makes me feel worse, and I shouldn't feel like I'm not allowed to feel like this just because others have it worse. And on the sixth hand, I might be able to completely resolve this whole thing by forgoing the gender binary and identifying as genderfluid, or agender, or bigender, but despite not really identifying strongly with either of the binary genders, I don't really identify with any of the non-binary genders. I don't want to invent my own new custom gender, cause that would just be a train wreck. My gender is a paradox, defined as the state of wanting to be both male and female, but not bigender, wanting to not have to deal with gender at all, but not agender, and having constantly shifting views of my own gender, but not genderfluid.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",trans,Just came out to my mom. Not sure what exactly I came out as.,1573280335.0,"{'created_utc': 1573255135, 'id': 'dtno65', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Oh boy this is going to be long.\n\nI told her I might be trans. She was surprised, I told her I was surprised too. She said whatever I do is fine. It went fine, overall, very chill. I just wish I could know for myself. On Monday, I was writing something for English where the main character was trans, and after the character had a bit of an emotional breakdown, I was just like ""wait that\'s just me isn\'t it."" So, I had a bit of a crisis as well. It went fine. I wrote some stuff about myself and how confused I am. For a bit I thought I was most likely a trans woman. Then I went through the rest of the week, thinking about it constantly. My reccomended was flooded with trans content, I found this subreddit, I considered the logistics of various things I hadn\'t thought of. It\'s been weird. From Tuesday to Thursday, while I was thinking about it a lot, I started thinking that I probably wasn\'t trans. And then, late last night, I realized there was a good chance I was an egg, and if I was, I was currently in the process of cracking. And I was convinced I did. I thought I had come to an at least mostly conclusive decision I was trans, and resolved to come out bu the end of today. And then, as the day passed, I wavered again. But, I consider myself to be on good terms with my past self, and if he really wanted this, and felt he needed to tell our parents how he was feeling, I wasn\'t going to change my mind. So I came out, it was very casual, I was trying to be a little goofy about it, to show I\'m not too distraught or that they need to worry themselves too much over this. And yeah. Now it\'s now.\n\nSo that\'s what happened over my week, I guess this next part is going to more of my internal thoughts and musings.\n\nSo, I\'ve thought about this more lightly before this Monday, and the conclusion I came to when I did was that I don\'t really have a naturally strong sense of gender identity, so I just latched myself onto what was easiest and I was most used to, my biological sex. And I was happy with this conclusion for a while. Then, the English assignment came along. I didn\'t write a trans character because I was feeling this way, I started writing it, which got me thinking about this more and more. She was a trans girl in the 1910s (Didn\'t want to do historical fiction, but that was the assignment.) I knew it would be hard, I knew that I a cis boy, couldn\'t really understand the experiences and feelings of a trans girl. But, knowing I had thought about this and had questions about it, thought I could just have her sort of think about the same things I did, and have the same kinds of questions, and everything would be the same up until she concluded she\'s a girl where I concluded I was a boy. You know what they say, if you don\'t know how to write a character, just make them an exact copy of yourself.  There was something I noticed here. Why was it easier for me to write a trans girl than a trans boy? You\'d think, identifying as male, I could just write someone like me, who was born with a vagina. My brother pointed this out too, and all I could think of was ""yeah that is weird."" This was when things really kicked off. I\'ve thought about if I would like to be a girl. And the answer is... kind of? I think it could be nice, honestly. It would just kind of feel nice to slip into she/her pronouns, and feminine clothing, and boobs. But on the other hand, I don\'t really have any problems with my current gender. I\'m alright, i consider myself a visually decent young man. I come on here and I see people who are moving past the life that was expected of them, showing and being proud of their true self. And I\'m so happy for them, I really am. But I don\'t resent my current pronouns, or name, or penis. But I think it could be really nice to grow up and mature into a lovely young lady. And on the third hand, *it\'s so hard.* transitioning is not easy. Explaining it to people can be uncomfortable, medically transitioning comes with puberty 2, and sometimes painful surgery, if that\'s what you want to do, and I have *no pain tolerance.* And no matter what you do, you are always gonna get shit for it. And I don\'t really want to have to deal with all that, I just want to sit around at home and play kingdom hearts. I don\'t get the feeling other people get of being trapped in their own skin, or only ever feeling that they could have been the way they are.

I read these stories every day all over the internet. Someone is at two months, four months, or even six months of HRT. They are looking in the mirror feeling discouraged. Dysphoria has done a number once again. I know for myself that, at the start of month four, I am examining myself one, two, three times a day in the mirror. I am combing my face for that new curve or measuring my boobs with my hands looking for that slight addition of mass that may have magically shown up while I was scripting at my desk all morning(after all boobs grow best with PowerShell). I have been caught in many an awkward position in the restroom at work, peering at my facial hair. In response, I have learned the art of quickly pretending to pop a zit or something.

Here is the deal. We all know this takes a while. We all have taken turns reading accounts of the significant changes accumulating around the 16 months to 2 yr marks. The problem is that we have seen enough of the “look what happened after just three months of HRT” posts to hope we are going to be those lucky few. I for one, don’t give up that hope. Let's face it, though; we aren’t helping our dysphoria issues any.

So what is an ambitious transitioning person like myself to do? After all, we put our whole lives on hold to transition. So shouldn’t it be right that we want to see results right away? Therein lies the problem. Transition is designed to enrich our lives, not to pause it. The medical transition could take up to five years if done without surgical alteration.

# The truth is we need to continue to live and let the magic happen in the background.

Why? Isn’t the point that we want to live as our genuine gender identities? YES....but…..in the meantime…..

***Explore Your New Mental Capacities***

Fact! Estrogen and Testosterone considerably change the chemical makeup of your brain and your perception of the day to day life around you. These changes happen early, so learn to take time out of each day to reflect. People often do not do this anymore because of the draw of Facebook and video games and just the hectic scheduled the modern working-class endure. I work 9 hr shifts with 3 hours of commuting. I have found that I can turn those 3 hours of torture in my car into a time to discover myself. 

Before I started HRT, I had never written anything outside of school. I hated the concept of grammar; I hated editing. I never felt I had anything to say. Now I find release in front of Microsoft Word. Sounds crazy, but to me, it's worth more than the boobs. Most of what I write never gets published. It's for me, and my release. Every once in a while, something like this does surface that I do feel comfortable publishing; It brings me great satisfaction to share my thoughts and experiences with others.

Other people find that they are musicians, or artists, or enjoy crafts and scrapbooking. Do what you discover that comes to you, experiment, you may love the results, and if you don’t, it was still worth the exploration. Trans Men and Non-Binary on Testosterone will often find that they have a new depth for logic and focused thought. Before I started Estrogen, I would spend hours inside my head, thinking about all the problems in the world and how I could solve them. I never answered the world's questions, but maybe you will. Afterall your take on life and past experiences give you a unique perspective on the condition of the world and society.

**Change the things you can control**

People often wait until after their body has changed to look at things like their weight and their voice, their mannerisms, etc. Right now is a great time to start. It's especially important to realize once you start changing, it might happen quicker than you anticipated and while your body is ready to come out, the rest of you isn’t. IF and only if you are unhappy with any of these things about yourself, this is an excellent time for self-improvement. I am choosing to work on all these things. I started at 420lbs, and now I am somewhere in the middle of the 200s. In my personal goals, I have a long way to go until I am comfortable. So instead of obsessing over my face, I can run or hit the gym.

**EVERYONE's TRANSITION IS DIFFERENT.**

There is no set weight, appearance, voice type, etc. Everyone has their own goals. I am saying use this time to figure out what they are, what needs to change, and how to change them. Then get busy. Maybe you want to be a better activist or more vocal about the rights of your community. Great. Start reading, attend meetings, learn about the politics of your region…whatever it is, step away from the mirror.

Medical transition is magical! There is no doubt about that, but it's slow, and it's frustrating. Dysphoria hates the waiting. Your life does not need to revolve around that process, find something meaningful and do it. The time will pass quickly and it will be rewarding the less time you obsess over your cup size today.",trans,"So, You are transitioning -- Don’t Forget To Live You Life!",1573351056.0,"{'created_utc': 1573325856, 'id': 'du02pk', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""  \n\nI read these stories every day all over the internet.

Comfort appreciated but not necessary. I just need to get this out.

I'm transgender (*ftm*) and bisexual (*considering pan but.... you'll see.*) I was talking to my mom about my best friend's girlfriend, who is bisexual. My mom says, and I quote:

""I wonder, in 10 years, how many of you will still identify as bisexual. It's just experimentation.""

...*what*????

She went on a rant on how ""Your generation feels the need to put a title on it. I don't want you coming out because then you'll have a new title. And what if it's just a phase? You can't erase that from your life.""

While I have had a rough journey in my sexuality through the past couple years, my mom has been there to support me. Now, when I came out as trans, she's started to slip, and fall into denial.

""You're *not* depressed.""

""You don't *need* your meds""

""**This whole trans thing** ***doesn't*** **seem like** ***you***.""

I'm getting off course.

My mom starts with ""Back in my day...""

So. Yeah.

""There was only straight and gay. Bi didn't exist. It was experimentation. And it was frowned upon.

""It seems like now, all you guys care about is sexuality. (*Not. True.*) The first thing you ask your new friends is ""*whats your sexuality*?"" (*we don't do it that blatantly. And besides, it's only so we can know what kind of teasing they're comfortable with, and what pronouns to use for fictional love interests*)

""I'm just worried that you're turning like this because you hang out with those kinds of people. (*A side note: she* says *shes not transphobic but she has been acting more and more so since my stepdad starting talking out his transphobic shit, and shes been agreeing with him. Oh, the irony.*)

""Why is your friend group mostly gay? Isn't the world statistics the other way around?""

A reminder: This all started when I *mentioned* my *best friends girlfriend*. This was just supposed to be a friendly mom-and-son conversation. Not a lecture about how I'm not the child she wanted.

I was going to the parade as a way to thank local veterans but I also thought I might try and register some voters there or get them to register to vote by mail (Florida). Never hurts to ask people if they are up to date on their registration. No sooner than I had started to set up, two women came up to me and my friend and asked us if we were registered to vote. They had the same idea as us but they were already canvassing the crowd.

Immediately, I recognized one woman as being trans. Now I don't have any issues with being out but I know that other trans people aren't so comfortable being clocked. So I didn't say anything directly to her about it. She looked fabulous too, cis people aren't going to clock her (I know for a fact that my friend did not) but my transponder is unfortunately quite good. She even had a hat on that was the colors of the trans flag that said something about mermaids. I complimented it, she only said, ""Thanks"". 

I mentioned the groups I'm involved with, including the LGBTQ+ caucus and I also had my bracelet on which is in trans colors and says ""Trans Pride"" on it. (I got this at the Trans Visibility March on Washington, I think it's pretty cool.) No reaction from her and I wasn't about to out her. 

It is so incredibly rare to meet trans people who are working on anything political, at least where I live.

My boyfriend (it’s complicated, but we were dating and are only taking a break due to mental health reasons) is trans and is going through a lot of tough things right now.

Most of it has to do with sex. Apparently he forced himself to like it due to it triggering extreme dysphoria for him to do sexual things. It also has to do with this kid who’s sexually harassed/assaulted him very recently, as he’s having trouble even showering due to the mental distress it’s caused him, and since he hates looking at himself even more.

This was about 4 months ago but the truth came out a couple of days ago.

Classic how he went through the cycle of being an asshole to me, then being almost flirtatiously sweet to me then when things didnt go his way with my young friend who is polyamorous and he hates me again and my friendship with this girl is his excuse to hate me again. It's a fucking transphobic front and I'm making sure that most of my coworkers know about his shit.
He was a real motherfucker to my friend and accused her of trying to fake when she was raped, insinuating that she had sex with him consenting and she was just trying to fuck her attacker over unfairly supposedly. I told her that shit today. I told a few people how he tried to hook up with a trans girl who used to work there before. At the end of the day he ran me though all these transphobic and misogynistic games and I want him to burn for it. I almost never wanted to see someone burn so bad! I'm angry for all of us and this is bigger than me because he is fucking transphobic misogynist pos. He needs to suffer because he wont change and his only chance is his life needs to be destroyed and fuck him anyways.

Either way I feel used.

I got some really bad dysphoria when I found out that the trans girl he tried to hook up with passed among the crew and ppl clocked me on day one because of my voice if not my appearance.(this came out in the discussion which revealed my coworker being a cowardly transphobic shit talker behind my back) I went through a day of dysphoric depression over this shit and finally put it away, just feeling vindicated that the owner of the pizza place i work at told me that basically fuck him, we put out a job ad and when we get a pizza cook he's fucking burnt crust.

They encouraged me to basically fuck him over and leave early without telling him when we were scheduled to close together, probably the coolest thing I've ever had a business owner tell me to do.

Something seems off though. I wonder if this will flip to me just looking crazy and petty even though I'm not.. I wonder but I'm not worried..
But what really bothers me is how dysphoria seems to hit in waves.
As I worked by him tonight the sense that he is entitled just was making me mad. I slammed my locker shut after being the ice queen to him all day.

Like wtf you are so fucking entitled that I'm not passing and that I'm just a faggot to you? Like I dont deservebthe same opportunities and I deserve to be isolated because I'm an ugly old tranny.....? I feel so fucking shitty even thinking about it.

Ugh! It makes me even more mad that he would keep this secret that he tried to hook up with this passing privileged girl who behaves like a fucking drag queen but I get clocked because I smoke a lot of weed and listen to trap and metal and I've been in fights, or maybe I'm just fucking ugly. Wtf is up with societies standard of passing? Am I just not feminine enough or am I just fucking ugly af or something...? Ugh!!!! Now I'm just drinking alone and I'm pissed and drunk!

(Another Disclaimer: I refer to my crush as he/him in this whole post because he has not told me otherwise, despite my suspicions. I do not mean any disrespect.)

Hey, so I need some advice from those of you who are more knowledgable in this situation. 

I have a crush on this person, he has presented himself as a guy, goes by a male name, and has a low voice and a biologically male body... he came out to me as bisexual, and spends a lot of time in the LGBTQ center at our university. We have been in a bunch of classes together, and recently caught feelings for each other, and confessed them. 

He is a very reserved person and has only opened up to me in a very personal way very recently. 

He knows I am very religious, and that I have no experience with LGBTQ culture, given my upraising. I have also recently asked some taboo questions about one of his exes, a trans masculine, not knowing what I'm doing. He got defensive. 

Today he said that there is something he's not telling me about himself that he thinks will weird me out. I think I know what it is. Maybe I'm reading too much into everything, but he told me recently how he likes wearing skirts, and I noticed that he shaves his arms and has grown his head hair out really long and sometimes wears pretty clips in it. I hope I am not doing something wrong by wondering if these are signs he is actually trans feminine. This would also fit some things he has said. 

I am not pushing him to tell me, but told him that I am more understanding than he thinks, and that I would like to get to know him better, as well as saying that nothing he could tell me about himself would change my opinion of him. He hasn't texted me back after I said all of this. 

I just want to know, is there something I can do to make him feel more comfortable to tell me (if he wants to) whatever his secret is, whether he comes out to me as trans or otherwise?

I am starting to try and educate myself on trans culture, both for my betterment as a person and so I can connect with him if this is his secret.

(Another Disclaimer: I refer to my crush as he/him in this whole post because he has not told me otherwise, despite my suspicions. I do not mean any disrespect.)

Hey, so I need some advice from those of you who are more knowledgable in this situation. 

I have a crush on this person, he has presented himself as a guy, goes by a male name, and has a low voice and a biologically male body... he came out to me as bisexual, and spends a lot of time in the LGBTQ center at our university. We have been in a bunch of classes together, and recently caught feelings for each other, and confessed them. 

He is a very reserved person and has only opened up to me in a very personal way very recently. 

He knows I am very religious, and that I have no experience with LGBTQ culture, given my upraising. I have also recently asked some taboo questions about one of his exes, a trans masculine, not knowing what I'm doing. He got defensive. 

Today he said that there is something he's not telling me about himself that he thinks will weird me out. I think I know what it is. Maybe I'm reading too much into everything, but he told me recently how he likes wearing skirts, and I noticed that he shaves his arms and has grown his head hair out really long and sometimes wears pretty clips in it. I hope I am not doing something wrong by wondering if these are signs he is actually trans feminine. This would also fit some things he has said.

I just want to know, is there something I can do to make him feel more comfortable to tell me (if he wants to) whatever his secret is, whether he comes out to me as trans or otherwise?

2019-11-12 07:09:43,dv6hmj,6,1,"Maybe it was easier when I thought it was just depression. 


I thought I had finally figured it out: I was fighting faceless internal darkness (the best kind of internal darkness). For some reason this gave me hope. An undefined enemy has undefined weaknesses, and that meant I could win. It was a fairytale and I was a knight with magic armor and a badass sword some old guy gave me. That darkness was about to get jumped by me, my wizard therapists, and a grab bag of mana crystals provided by multi-national conglomerate pharmaceutical giants. 


But then I realized I was trans, and that the darkness wasn’t faceless at all. In fact, it had my face – my real face. 


I was fighting myself.


When I turned to look at the people behind me, all I saw were monsters - People who I called family and friends and neighbors moments ago became ruthless enemies determined to kill me, as if I had discovered a dark secret of the realm.


Slowly I came to realize the narrative of my story. Now that the antagonist is defined, the truth comes out… the awful, horrific, real-life truth comes out…


I can never win. I can only fight.


I guess the good news is my character sheet says I was born fighting, and I was born to fight. Maybe it’ll be easier now that I’m not fighting myself.

I also realize now that I’m not alone. I’m not a one-off, one-of-a-kind aberration. The DM finally finished my backstory, and gave me a people. I have a side to side with…

2019-11-12 20:31:40,dvfu3z,11,1,"Hey so recently my levels were really disappointing.   


My estradiol was down at 33 pg/dL and my testosterone was at 200 ng/dL  


That basically means that my estrogen was in male range and my testosterone was climbing back up to male range.   


It was horrible and I was terrified the HRT wasn't working anymore.  I started to smell a little different, hair was growing in thicker and it was harder to get a clean shave and I was getting more uncomfortable and longer lasting erections.  I thought that it was so many different things.   


I knew smoking / vaping was bad but I didn't know that it not only substantially decreased the efficacy of estradiol but it then did something to actually turn the excess estrogen into testosterone!    


So when I got that test I quit smoking and vaping (at that point it was mostly vaping but I had been smoking for a few months before hand). A month from then I recently got a new test and my testosterone was: 16 ng/dL   
and my estrogen is up at 93 pg/DL  


Nicotine withdrawals plus a complete shift in hormones hasn't been the easiest thing but it was so worth it. If you take sublingual estrogen and you smoke you may be making it really hard for your hormones to do what they need to!

I started to smell a little different, hair was growing in thicker and it was harder to get a clean shave and I was getting more uncomfortable and longer lasting erections.  I thought that it was so many different things.   \n\n\nI knew smoking / vaping was bad but I didn't know that it not only substantially decreased the efficacy of estradiol but it then did something to actually turn the excess estrogen into testosterone!    \n\n\nSo when I got that test I quit smoking and vaping (at that point it was mostly vaping but I had been smoking for a few months before hand). A month from then I recently got a new test and my testosterone was: 16 ng/dL   \nand my estrogen is up at 93 pg/DL  \n\n\nNicotine withdrawals plus a complete shift in hormones hasn't been the easiest thing but it was so worth it.

Hello all, 

I don't know where to start.
At this point I honestly hate being trans. And I don't know how to handle it. I can't seem to get over the fact that I'll never be a ""real"" woman, that I'll never be able to give birth to a child and to never get a period. I don't know what ive done to come here but it seems that I am faking everything at this point. I'm pre everything and definitely not passing as woman/girl. And it hurts. Real bad. All these thoughts and ""facts"" made me think and now I honestly hate being trans. But it's not like I can quit because I want to be a woman, I don't want to be whatever I am at this moment. I am getting professional help hopefully soon, but I just wanted to know if you have some helpful advice for me. 

I am really sorry if this message made you feel bad about yourself, but I don't know what to do at this point. Again, I'm sorry.

I've been questioning my gender since I was around 14 and you can probably tell by the title it's not an easy time, like for most people. Especially because I live in a more conservative area with some pretty intolerant people in my group of friends. 

It's only been in the past few months where I've proper opened up about being possibly trans, my closest friends call me a feminine name which I like (for anonymity reasons we'll just say Alex for feminine and Kyle for masculine) and I've even had my college name tag changed but I feel its a big step too fast but it's nice. My closest friends are really accepting and we kinda treat it like I am 100% trans which I'm fine with but they do know u still feel odd about it. My best friend had said ""but you are a woman"" to something I said and that really got to me in a positive way. 

I do tend to use feminine deodorant and shower gel but I do prefer baths because I can shave my legs, been doing that since about 15-ish? Speaking of which I do shave my arms to and I'm not going to in to more detail about what I do shave. I do also feel a bit weird about my body, not sure if that's just image issues or dysphoria but I would like my hips to be a bit wider and my shoulders to be less wide. 

There's times where I feel a lot more confident about it like I remember telling my closest friend how I felt about 92%-ish and a couple days later I was completely unsure about myself again. Not sure if that's hinting towards gender fluidity or what but I feel it would be a bit of an ask to have people call me 2 names depending on the day, especially since a few of my friends thinks being gender fluid is made up but then again I'm not especially close with them. 

I get really self conscious as well about how other people find out and transition. Like I hear how people know from dy one, they never acted like the gender they were assigned at birth, and when i hear that I just think these people are so confident in how they feel and I'm just a mess with it all and it's a big hit on the confidence you know?

Okay, so, I'm an 18 year old FtM trans guy, I've been on hormones for three months today. The other day, I got the amazing news that I could be eligible for top surgery before I'm even 19. I was ecstatic, since my chest is where most of my dysphoria comes from. I was so excited, I got to looking at surgeons and what I need to get started.

Here's where my problem lies. I'm scared. Not scared that I'll regret it, or scared that I won't like the outcome. I know it's permanent,and I'm perfectly fine with all of those factors. But I think I'm scared that going into top surgery after only being on T for three months is too hasty.

I know it's permanent,and I'm perfectly fine with all of those factors. But I think I'm scared that going into top surgery after only being on T for three months is too hasty. I don't want to rush things, but my dysphoria is screaming at me to just do it as soon as I can. I'm not sure what to do, have any other transmasc people felt this? Any ideas?"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Nervous about Top Surgery', 'created': 1573792286.0}"

2019-11-15 00:01:57,dwibf7,2,1,"so far, i’ve only come out to one friend, and i’m working on coming out to more so that i can build a support group who will help me on my journey and hopefully someday help me get enough courage to come out to my parents and begin my transition.

however, i have two more very close friends who i can’t seem to bring myself to come out to.

one of them is a ftm who’s publicly trans and presents male all the time. he used to arguably be my best friend around 4 years ago, and now we go to different schools, but we still talk from time to time and i trust him a lot.

my other friend is a girl who’s at my school and we have a lot in common. we aren’t exactly best friends (like we don’t really “hang out”) but she’s super easy to talk to and i definitely know her better than most. she’s also been vocally supportive of lgbt+ rights and equality in the past. the friend who i’ve already come out to told me that he’s pretty sure (around 70% sure, he said) that this girl’s older sister is trans (who’s quite a bit older and is well out of college by now).

i guess i’m just afraid to bring it up because it’s clearly a sensitive area for both of them and compared to what they’ve both been through i’m worried i’d come across as fake. if i’m being honest i think that’s the only reason i’m not out to either of them yet.

at this point though, these people are probably my two greatest potential allies and i really can’t afford to stall forever. i’ve mentally formulated a bit of a plan in order to impose deadlines to pressure myself (otherwise i’d just sit in the closet forever), and that plan has me coming out to my parents in March, which means i’m hoping to be out to at least 6 (or so) friends by then.

I am fully self aware that even my post is a bit ridiculous but the deal is, we haven't met in person yet and she hasn't disclosed the reason she doesn't want to transition but seems fine with referring to the fact she has male parts but is extreeeeemly feminine. Cool.

 I'm very open minded sexually but this is worrying me slightly because I would never want to make her feel bad.   
I have been intimate with both men and woman but I am struggling with the idea that yes I can get her male parts off but....   


I'm a person who likes to know everything before I do anything and the mystery is giving me huge anxiety, I wouldn't want to ruin her date. She said she doesn't meet people often due to her status.

2019-11-16 07:03:47,dx3mb0,5,1,"Just sharing some nice news from this week!

So my classmate and I have spent a lot of this semester together. We have known each other 3 years, since freshman year of college, and I've known her as a male this whole time. She's pre-op, though she naturally has some feminine features. Since we're in two classes together, we see each other Monday-Thursday, walking from class to class together, and study together on the weekends for hours. Catching feelings was bound to happen, and so it did. 

About a week ago, my crush texted me, saying ""I like you, but if you knew more about me, you'd be weirded out."" I assured her that even if I was weirded out, I would figure it out, and would ultimately be understanding. She was concerned about telling me, since I am very religious and highly uneducated about trans culture, and had made a faux pa  the week previous when discussing her trans ex. 

After she said she was worried I'd be weirded out, I put together a lot of pieces of the puzzle and hypothesized that she was trans. There were a number of signs, in things she said and did. Guessing this and feeling convicted in my faith for not trying to understand a group of people different than me, I went to her the next day and said, ""I'm uneducated in trans culture. Can you point me in the direction of where to start learning?"" She was surprised and happy, I think. 

In a statistically unlikely turn of events, the same day I said this to my crush, a COMPLETELY UNRELATED friend, who doesn't know her at all, and knew nothing about my new initiative, came out to me as transfeminine. It blew my mind, how bold she was and how unexpected the event was. I told my crush about it, and she felt that I reacted in a good way. That day she texted and said ""Idk if you're up for more surprises, but I want to tell you something."" I was so overwhelmed with all the new information, both my friend coming out and the trans research I was doing, that I asked if we could talk the next day. She said maybe. 

The next day comes, and she's clearly nervous, and keeps putting off talking to me. I straight up say ""I think I know what you're gonna say, and I hope you know it won't change how I feel about you"". But she's still nervous. There's this tension throughout dinner, then after as we're studying, and because I'm a straightforward type person, I say ""Look, I think we both know what you're too nervous to say, but I wish we could just talk about it since this is clearly more important than this homework."" She was still reluctant, but finally, she pulled out her phone and texted it to me, even though I was right there. 
""Alright, I'll say it. I'm trans.""

Of course I hugged her, and thanked her for coming out. It was so nice to finally have everything out in the open, and now we're continuing our flirtationship with a better understanding of each other. I think she's adorable, and love who she is. She and I have different values and goals, so we're not planning on dating, just flirting a bit and enjoying each other. I am really happy that she felt comfortable coming out to me, even though she is still being reserved about things involving her gender identity, like how she is avoiding showing me what she looks like when she dresses like a woman. She still lives with her conservative parents, and they don't know, so she has a secret instagram account where she puts pictures. I'd like to see, but I don't want to push it. 

So that's how everything stands so far! It's a great development, and I look forward to learning more and spending more time with a fabulous person.",trans,(Cis/F/bi/21) my transfeminine crush came out to me!,1573913027.0,"{'created_utc': 1573887827, 'id': 'dx3mb0', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Just sharing some nice news from this week!\n\nSo my classmate and I have spent a lot of this semester together.

Dear Colleagues;

I wish to inform you of an important change in my personal and professional life.  It is important that you hear these changes directly from me, as I value and greatly respect you and our professional relationship.

I have struggled throughout my life with a condition known as gender dysphoria, which involves a disconnect between my physical birth gender and how I perceive myself.  I have managed for many years to repress my feelings and my need to express my true gender but have now come to realize that I have no choice but to be true to myself for the first time.

I am transgender and earlier this year I started the process of transitioning.  On (Date) I will start to socially transition at work.  I have legally changed my name to (Name) and am asking that everyone start referring to me by that name, and using female she/her pronouns when referring to me.  

I realize and appreciate that my gender change is something you may not understand.  Please know that I do not expect everyone to endorse my decision, nor do I expect to change your beliefs or opinions about whether my decision to transition is appropriate.  I do hope you will understand that for me this decision was not a choice; it’s who I am and have always been, from my earliest memories.

2019-11-17 01:56:28,dxgdnx,2,1," Starting off, I'm a 20M Asian gay guy who I can self-describe myself as softly effeminate, reserved and soft-spoken. Recently, I've been having growing feelings of the desire for people, mainly guys, to treat me as a straight female. The best I could explain it is with how some women wanting to be treated by their male friends like fellow 'bros' or 'homies', it's a reverse sentiment for myself, wanting my male friends and also guys in general to see me as a woman.

As a guy, I never hold many traits that I could consider masculine (never associating myself with bromance) and I feel more comfortable being in touch with traits considered feminine. For one, I crave deep-rooted intimacy with my male friends (unlike most guys) and am extremely affectionate with guys in general (when receptive or asked). I'm very open-minded when it comes to any intimacy... putting my head on a guy's chest, playing with his chest hair and listening to his heartbeat and deep breathing, being kissed on my forehead from time to time, sitting on a guy's lap to holding hands whether we're just friends or much more.

I feel like I want to be nurturing, supportive... loving. I just don't feel appreciated as a male to be in that role and I feel if I was a female, I would be treated differently and the fact is, I want to. My guy friends wouldn't have to be so emotionally distant, and I feel like they would do better in opening up to me through our friendships if that was the case. I desire guys whom I can completely trust without hesitation and be nurturing to them, to make them feel all gooey on the inside. In return, the safety, feeling of being protected and I matter to a guy is something I deeply crave.

On the sexual side of things, I find that if a guy wanted to make me or treat me as a woman, and if he would ask if it's alright if he made me wear some lingerie to make me feel feminine, exposed, make me more beautiful... I'd would like that very much. I've started to nurture my female persona by giving it a name... Cassie. I would gradually become more self-aware in my mannerisms, subtly changing them to be more feminine (e.g. waving my hands more when I'm explaining things, sitting in lady-like positions with knees closed and ankles crossed)

Most nights, I would read cheesy erotic fiction/romance stories where I would imagine myself more and more in the character of being feminine, trans/cross-dressers, wanting to escape in the fantasy of being a loving gf, and a wife... with a manly husband I'd want to wash over me with his tide of testosterone but holding a gentle and caring heart to take care of me and nurture me too. Sometimes, I would cry myself to sleep hoping it would be true in my life.

Growing up in a conservative household, my parents haven't been the most emotionally nurturing or supporting parents. In the past, my relationship between them has been heavily strained and to this day, I still don't trust them or haven't completely forgiven them for the past hurt they've placed on me. I don't think I ever will. It's not something I like to talk about in great detail.

I feel like my male friends wouldn't understand or be open-minded to what I'm feeling right now, and all I want is for a guy who can do so and won't reserve no judgment, but I want to take a step and trust at least one. I'm getting in touch with one of my guy friends soon and thinking it would be best to come out to him but I don't know how would I express it, I don't think I'm even trans enough but I would like it if people would refer to me with female pronouns and calling me by my female name, even if it meant I'm not strictly going through MtF, SRS or HRT any time soon.

Hordes of Insta models that were popping off with one thing in common : FAT ASSES

Every insta girl left and right was getting their butt done. I then realized that the greatest looks-maxxing procedure for a woman was the Brazilian Butt Lift

However, when it comes to the trans community, no one talks about it. BBL (Brazilian Butt lift) is a fat transfer procedure where they transfer the fat in your body to your butt and hips.

I hypothesized that this would be the procedure that could give an MTF the proportions of a women, being that it is a fat transfer surgery that can be done multiple times. After some research, I found that most instagram models and strippers were going to surgeons overseas to get their BBL's done for reasons such as:

\- Its much cheaper

\- they are more aggressive with liposuction and surgery - hence better results

I saw box shaped bodies with a pudgy, disgusting, waist and a flat butt turn to hourglass bodies with a tight fit waist and big round bubble butt. A real womans body.

The results from BBL's are insane.

Ex 2: [http://prntscr.com/py0fl1](http://prntscr.com/py0fl1)

With the BBL, it is now possible for MTF's to achieve the body similar to Kim Kardashian or perhaps an instagram model. As social media dictates, being slim thick is the wave.

I've been thinking, and reflecting, and reading stuff online for a while, and have come to the conclusion that I may be trans? But I'm not sure, and while I know it's something I'll have to think on for a bit and find out on my own, I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on here.

To start, I'm female, biologically. But as a kid when I played games for pretend, I was always a male lion or horse or whatever. When I write characters to write books, it's always from a male POV. I relate to male characters better, and have more male friends. I enjoy being in a group of guys and just being considered one of them, rather than being ""the girl"". Even better if someone actually mistakes me for a guy, that's very exciting. In high school, for whatever reason, a classmate threatened to call me by a guy's name and I just said ""okay"" and was secretly so thrilled that he *did*, for the next two years. I always dream from the POV of a guy (like it's him, but it's me, and it's entirely interchangeable). When I worked at a place where there was a guy's uniform and a girl's uniform, I badgered the manager into letting me wear the guy's, for no other reason than that I wanted to (they looked nearly identical, I was pretty much the only one who would notice that I wore the guy's at all). I tend to think of my clothing and shoe size in mens', and then switch to womens' when I need to. About five years ago I cut my hair really short (but not as short as I wanted, because my parents wouldn't let me) and straight up said I wanted a boy haircut (I've since let it grow back out because curly hair at an awkward mid length tends to be bad. Someday I do want to get that really short boy cut though...). I've even imagined having male anatomy at times.

SO. All that, and yet I'm not particularly dysphoric. I mean I know I said I've imagined having male anatomy, and I would really like to try a binder, but I'm also not like super upset at having female anatomy. And I know the discourse on dysphoria can get really nasty. I don't want to encroach on spaces that aren't mind. I'm worried that maybe everything I've said can be explained away by where and how I grew up and how society has conditioned me, or something. Any thoughts at all would be fabulous.

So the other day I was with my 2 cis female friends trying to find a 21st dress for one of them and the other was trying on dresses for fun, one of the ladies working at the shop was trans. 
Y'know how we can clock each other? I didn't wanna come out and say ""hey, are you trans too?"" Even though I'm FTM, I was trying so hard to convey with out speaking Me! I'm trans too!! 
Like, I've got a He/him pin and a couple trans flag patches on my bag and I kind of describe myself as looking like a halfling, facial hair, deep voice while also having a rather large bust.

On the way out of the shop I whispered to my friends, ""that nice lady? She was trans"" and they we're so shocked, they asked how I knew and I kinda went a bit too hard on my answer saying ""the only inherently trans positive media you've seen is Ru Paul's drag race. She didn't have her eyebrows halfway up her forehead and purple glittery eyeshadow, trans folks can look 'normal just like you ""  she nodded lmao.

I have been reading a bunch of stuff on reddit about different trans issues and I have some questions why do some trans people (apparently I haven't seen it myself) not disclose they are trans I don't understand all the emotions behind it as I don't feel emotions for some reason but if people get killed over this and just being trans in General why not just disclose it some people hate trans people and a lot of people don't at the same time 

This is how I look at it in my head if I go out to dinner and  I order chicken I expect to get chicken not fish with chicken seasoning I have no problem with fish I just don't want it I want chicken wouldn't you be upset if you got meat as a vegan and they tried to say it was not meat but plants and then when you dindt want it they called you meatphobic and whatever else this is just an analogy I use in my head to help me understand 

I just think there are a lot of men that are into trans people why not just be with the people who are cool with you why would any trans person try to date straight person if that person is straight the want the opposite sex and that's okay it's unfair to them if you lie about the sex you were born as  you probably believe that you are whatever sex you transitioned to and that's your right to feel that way I don't try to say anything different but they may not believe that you are the sex you transitioned to to them it's just a dude in make-up or wherever they may believe and that's also their right just because you want something doesn't mean you can lie to get it  if you have transitioned that is great and I'm very happy for you but please if you're trying to date straight  people just let them know about it you have nothing to be ashamed of it's their loss if they aren't cool with it I'm just saying if some one believes you are the gender you were born as then to them if they are that same gender they are now gay if they are attracted to you or sleep with you they aren't really but to them it's just as real as you being born in the wrong body so it probably makes them feel dirty or something like that and if they feel that way then to them it's true even if it's not so put yourself in there shoes and think about how you would feel if you had something like that happen to you

in october 2019, i was prepping for name changes at my work place. i've been socially transitioned for a while now, my testosterone date is fast approaching on november 26th. as my coworkers transitioned my name, my employers got wind of it and shortly after, i was terminated with no reason why or anything. i was kicked from the work chat, the schedule, etc and was never told a single thing. now, where i live there are ***no*** laws protecting the LGBT as a whole in the workplace, and it is a right to work state. they are legally able to fire me over it. 

we traced everything, and come to find out someone had mentioned that i'm trans the same day i was fired. it's hard to be stealth when you're pre-hormones but can usually pass as your should've been gender. 

today, i got a job offer from my university after an interview that took place on the 15th. one of my close friends got me the interview and brought up the situation beforehand.   
upon me accepting the request, current staff was talked to and was told there would be no tolerating any harassment or mistreatment towards me because of my gender identity. 

so, do not give up hope on workplaces. if you're struggling with it or have gotten fired like i have, have no fears, because there is a much better workplace waiting for you to merge into.

2019-11-18 23:50:51,dybw2p,6,1,"So this is a very specific topic for this subreddit and I don't mean to take the spotlight for it but, this thought has been plaguing me for weeks now.

I like making movies and in the past month I've been developing a story about a trans character. I don't want to give away too much but I wanted to hear from you guys because I want to make sure this doesn't suck. I'm non binary myself so this is kinda my view point although most of the character's traits are really my interpretation of them since, as I said, this is a movie and doesn't have to represent anyone's life.

This is all gonna be in fantasy land and with stop motion puppets. The premise is that this trans character is a nomad and lives off of stealing food from rich markets and just lives in the woods (one of the main influences was Diogenes). The whole movie is just different random scenes. They wear both female and male clothes (this is how it's shown that they are trans). Then sometimes they get super drunk off of stolen wine. At the end they are brutally killed by two rich kids while the main character is wearing a woman's dress.

I mean it sounds kinda tame like this, but I don't want a trans person to see this and think that I'm representing them as lazy and thieves. Also they would think what good does it do if the main character is just killed off like that, is that my fate too? Or something like that. I mean my intent is to just show the depression related to it all and some happiness that comes from defying society (stealing) and at then end just have villains kill the character off because they are seen as ""different"", which is definitely not a far fetched situation in the past (or today) for a trans person.

So my issue is, I like this story but I keep imagining ways for someone to get mad at me because, mainly, I have to put my name on it you know? I mean if it were up to me I wouldn't really care but I'm gonna be trying to show this to people for a while and also the process of making it takes a lot of time that I don't want to see go to waste.",trans,"Is my movie about trans issues ""too much""?",1574146251.0,"{'created_utc': 1574121051, 'id': 'dybw2p', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'So this is a very specific topic for this subreddit and I don\'t mean to take the spotlight for it but, this thought has been plaguing me for weeks now.\n\nI like making movies and in the past month I\'ve been developing a story about a trans character.

2019-11-19 10:08:58,dyij3z,1,1,"So, just for context, I’m a 14 year old FTM, and I’ve been out since April of 2019. It’s been 6 months, SIX!! 

Okay, I’ll explain why I’m mad. Well, more upset then mad. I fully understand that it takes time for parents to understand if their child wants to be called by their preferred name, wants to be referred to by son or daughter instead of what they were called before, etc. That shit takes time. But... it’s been six months, and she still misgenders me. 

I’m called ‘my little girl’ by my mum, she still calls me pretty even though I always politely remind her I’d like to be called ‘handsome’, as it helps keep my dysphoria away. 

I’ve asked if she can look into starting me on testosterone, and she makes up excuses despite the fact my therapist has done research on this shit, and told her...

I'm technically trans, but I can’t transition mostly because of the societal issues and money and fear of my future health (family has a lot of cancer and I’m afraid hormone therapy would increase my already high likelihood of cancer). 

I really didn’t think female technicians were still uncommon these days, but I’ve learned it still is where I’m from. I go into peoples houses alone to fix whatever needs repair, and every day, sometimes more than once a day, I get locked into a conversation that usually starts like, “I didn’t expect a woman! Wow! I’m so surprised. Good job! It’s good to see women doing these things. Women can do what men can do too! Girl power!” 

I’ve had this job for nearly 10 years, and the occurrence and frequency of these conversations have not stopped. So when people constantly point out I’m a woman and say “Wow congrats” it’s extremely hard to not want to flat out tell them to drop it.

People say it so much that I just go, “Oh yeah, haha, everyone says that,” Then I'm surprised that they're surprised that they’re not the first one to notice. I used to be really good at putting on a performance and really engaging in these conversations, but now I'm at the end of my rope. I can only really reply with one to two word sentences and forced smiles. People keep going on about it regardless, it's like I have no hope.

I realize this doesn't seem like a big issue. All my friends shrug when I complain. It reminds me of when a friend who delivered pizzas would complain about how people who would see him carrying a pizza would have a list of annoying reoccurring phrases they’d say almost like they were NPCs, like “Oh hey is that for me?” or something. So I realize this problem doesn’t seem like a problem except for those who experience it, so all I can really say is imagine your job, but every day, you’re distracted from your work to have the same conversation about something about yourself you hate. And then you’re congratulated for it. How the fuck do I manage this? Even just opinions on it, negative or positive, or maybe tell me I’m complaining over nothing. Since I’m the only person I know with this annoying problem it would really help just to get out of my own echo chamber of a head.

Those of you who dont know its a major slapstick series of movies, that did pretty well at the time, but suffered from one of the main actors being accused of murdering his wife and spending the next 20 years as the main suspect. 

Any way near the end of the 3rd movie, Naked Gun Three and a Third, their is a very annoying transgender joke. The beautiful super sluty girl thats the main bad guys girlfriend finally comes around to falling for the good guy.  So she takes off all her clothes and then boom you see a shadow of a penis. At which point the good guy, who was totally in to cheating on his wife up till it popped up between them, freaks out and proceeds to puke in to a tuba.  
    Well this annoyed me, and please note this is a movie I have watched many times, though it has been several years and in interveining years I relized that I my self was transgender. I had forgotten that scene and I can't say for sure how I felt about it back then when I watched it for the first time but it annoyed me this time. 
    Now this and the like half of the ace ventura movie,(spoilers) for those of you who don't know the main bad guy in Ace Ventura turned out to be a man who escaped from a mental institution, turned himself in to a women. Their sketching on whether they thought themselves a women or they were just doing it for revenge so I'll use gender neutral pronouns. They then proceeds to sleep with everyone they can to get ahead and kill Dan Elway.  This all ended with the big reveal that they still have their manly bits and their tucked in the weirdest way ive ever heard of. 

Any body else know any other movies out their that make fun of are use transgender persons as the butt of these jokes. 

Keep in mind while these jokes piss me off I think the rest of the movies are funny for what they are stupied slap schit.

At the end of my last therapy session, my therapist suggested I attempt to look into self compassion. As I did, I realized that fighting this feeling that I’ve been battling this inner knowledge for as far as I can remember being nearly +28 years. A few close friends have relatives that are transitioning, that started to put cracks in this wall that I had built up against this knowledge that I have tried to ignore for far too long.
 Nov 3rd, I came out to my ex-fiance (relationship ended over a decade ago), she was truly accepting and is one of my biggest supporters, a week later I came out to my roommate/chosen sister, she was just was accepting and my biggest supporter. Earlier this week my sister gave me her waist cincher, I thought I was on cloud 9 at that time and have been glowing since. My sister told her husband the following day that I came out to her, he is truly like a brother to me, he is just as supportive and accepting. He would have a happy sister than a miserable brother.
Nearly half a lifetime ago I talked to my mom about these feelings that I had, she was accepting then, today, I reiterated my future plan(4-6 years) to transition into the female that I should’ve born into, she is just as accepting now as she was then, she has a few concerns as any mother truly does. 
As I got back home this evening, my sis gave me a bag of clothes that she had set aside to donate to the women’s shelter and allowed me to pick through and set aside anything that I want to wear in the mean time. Pants, shirts, 2 dresses! She has plans to make a few gaffes for me and our close friend that are transitioning, this is where Cloud 9 is, I forgot what happiness was and what it had felt like.
As someone in their early 30’s, I am completely astonishingly astounded with how much support and acceptance that I have received, I never thought I would be able to do this and that I would have to fight to choke these feelings down for the rest of my life.
I’m planning to see where my therapist stands on this spectrum and possibly come out to them in my next session in a few weeks.

I have been on the edge of tears of happiness so many times the past 2 weeks that I have lost count.

2019-11-21 09:14:20,dzgp1r,6,1,"Just thought I'd make a post about my thoughts on this. While I'm aware this might not change a lot of minds I think someone should call out this stuff. I've seen quite a few comments saying things along the lines of xy chromosomes make someone a man no matter what. Well then I'd have to ask why do xy chromosomes make someone a man? If there's no reasoning, then as far as I'm concerned it's just an opinion. If there is reasoning then this is where I see the contradiction. The only good reasoning one can give as to why xy chromosomes are considered ""male"" dna is because most people who have them have typical male characteristics(gonads, internal and external reproductive organs, secondary sex characteristics, and hormones). Excluding chromosomes and gonads trans women can shift all aforementioned characteristics towards that of a typical woman and remove the gonads they were born with. The process currently isn't perfect but at the end of it their bodies are undenyable shifted towards that of most cis women and away from most cis men. Evidence shows trans people have brains like that of the gender they identify as. On top of this there are women born physically female but possessing xy chromosomes. The point is you can't logically consider chromosomes an important sex trait without also accepting other traits are important as well. Even if one shifts the argument to say that all said traits are important but chromosomes are most important I would have to ask why again. The line of reasoning most critics might give is that chromosomes are obviously genetic and genetics are at the base of biology. The problem with this line of reasoning is that it ignores that others traits do involve genetics as well. Reguardless of one's chromosomes, we all have the genetic information of both sexes. Sex chromosomes just usually cause the body to follow one of the two sets of dna. The idea of sex chromosomes as a ""genetic switch"" has been accepted for quite a while but seems to be ignored when it comes to trans people. The whole reason  hormone therapy succeeds at changing the body is because trans women actually do have female genetics. In theory ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, cervix, and vaginal canal with normal vaginal tissie could be grown in a lab with stem cells drawn from a transwoman without having to alter the sex chromosomes in the cells.

I am MtF 5 months HRT but I cam out as trans years ago. This opportunity seemed to good to be true they were living in an area I wanted to move to eventually anyways and they extended the offer to my partner as well. I honestly thought things were looking up for once in my life. Lets just say the last however many years haven't been exactly kind to me, and the last six months have been a complete trip and the most positive in my life thanks to my partner, who came into my life around that time.   


So I moved. To somewhere that the only friends I had I was living with, I still have no job yet and going home is...touchy subject.   


So I have been here about a month. I was finally in a trans positive household for once or so I thought. It was only two weeks before the phrase. "" You will never bleed like I do"" was said to me. It's now been multiple times that the same two people I saw as friends have now on multiple occasions tried to manipulate me against my partner. I probably wouldn't have identified this had it not been for the fact this isn't the first time I've dealt with highly manipulative people. Them trying to tell me my partner, who is trans as well, and is the last human being to ever try to gatekeep or tell people how their experiences are, was gatekeeping my new roommates period and was telling my roommate how they experience life for them. As well as I was being told my partner was insulting them for being cis. Literally this is nothing that has happened or ever would happen. It's not that I trust my partner too much. Its that literally what she was accused of is the opposite of her personal philosophies. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I tried to keep peace that night while my roommate blew up at everyone in the room and made a mess of things until I was scared to open my mouth to speak at all. Out of fear of both fear of my words being turned and warped like my partners were or literally fear of something  being thrown at me.

   
To avoid conflict. I have avoided all confrontation like the plague........until 3 days ago. All four of us went to an event. When we got back. That same roommate started confrontation and I don't know what came over me but I fell right into it as well. Regrettably I lost my temper and raised my voice. That was the extent of my aggression before I was able to walk away and unfortunately my partner and her got into it. Nothing physical but I could hear, it their voices arguing. Eventually. It stopped.  My partner came to our room, and we were quiet the rest of the night.   


Slight context five of us live in this house. Myself and my partner, we aren't on the lease. My two former friends, one of which is the house owner and the other who is his partner(the one whom most conflict has been with).  The fifth is the house owners daughter. Also MtF. All of us are 18+  


So my partner and I stayed in our room. 6 hours later. I can still here that roommate screaming at her partner. Slamming things around, Acting as though this only happened because all of us are still male and still have to act like we have dominance. Proclaiming multiple times that she is the only ""real woman"" in the house. More of are yelling and ranting included things that seem incredibly unstable.   


Frankly put I haven't left my room for the last three days while the sun is up. I can't just move out and go home. I don't have somewhere to go. Even if my partners family took us in temporarily. What would that show her parents. She's only in this situation as well because of me. Us coming back and needing to stay with them would reflect poorly on all of us and put a mass amount of tension on her and her parents relationship. As well It took weeks for her job transfer to go through and it just did. So she isn't eligible for a new transfer back for potentially months.   
On top of things I'm finally in a city where there is a pretty positive LGBT community and we can present openly in public without fear. I just have no friends here.   


I know its a long post but I don't know what to do. I feel like this is all my fault. My roommates weren't like this before. As well as long as I avoided confrontation. Everything was fine. I'm the one who suggested we take the offer to move because I trusted the people and I regret it now. I wish I would have just stayed living in my apartment I had before. My partner and I were only a few months away from getting our own place, and now I can't help but feel like I screwed everything up for us.

I was finally in a trans positive household for once or so I thought. It was only two weeks before the phrase. "" You will never bleed like I do"" was said to me. It\'s now been multiple times that the same two people I saw as friends have now on multiple occasions tried to manipulate me against my partner. I probably wouldn\'t have identified this had it not been for the fact this isn\'t the first time I\'ve dealt with highly manipulative people. Them trying to tell me my partner, who is trans as well, and is the last human being to ever try to gatekeep or tell people how their experiences are, was gatekeeping my new roommates period and was telling my roommate how they experience life for them. As well as I was being told my partner was insulting them for being cis. Literally this is nothing that has happened or ever would happen. It\'s not that I trust my partner too much. Its that literally what she was accused of is the opposite of her personal philosophies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I tried to keep peace that night while my roommate blew up at everyone in the room and made a mess of things until I was scared to open my mouth to speak at all. Out of fear of both fear of my words being turned and warped like my partners were or literally fear of something  being thrown at me.\n\n   \nTo avoid conflict. I have avoided all confrontation like the plague........until 3 days ago. All four of us went to an event. When we got back. That same roommate started confrontation and I don\'t know what came over me but I fell right into it as well. Regrettably I lost my temper and raised my voice. That was the extent of my aggression before I was able to walk away and unfortunately my partner and her got into it. Nothing physical but I could hear, it their voices arguing. Eventually. It stopped.  My partner came to our room, and we were quiet the rest of the night.   \n\n\nSlight context five of us live in this house. Myself and my partner, we aren\'t on the lease. My two former friends, one of which is the house owner and the other who is his partner(the one whom most conflict has been with).  The fifth is the house owners daughter. Also MtF. All of us are 18+  \n\n\nSo my partner and I stayed in our room. 6 hours later. I can still here that roommate screaming at her partner. Slamming things around, Acting as though this only happened because all of us are still male and still have to act like we have dominance. Proclaiming multiple times that she is the only ""real woman"" in the house. More of are yelling and ranting included things that seem incredibly unstable.   \n\n\nFrankly put I haven\'t left my room for the last three days while the sun is up. I can\'t just move out and go home. I don\'t have somewhere to go. Even if my partners family took us in temporarily. What would that show her parents. She\'s only in this situation as well because of me. Us coming back and needing to stay with them would reflect poorly on all of us and put a mass amount of tension on her and her parents relationship. As well It took weeks for her job transfer to go through and it just did. So she isn\'t eligible for a new transfer back for potentially months.   \nOn top of things I\'m finally in a city where there is a pretty positive LGBT community and we can present openly in public without fear. I just have no friends here.   \n\n\nI know its a long post but I don\'t know what to do. I feel like this is all my fault. My roommates weren\'t like this before. As well as long as I avoided confrontation. Everything was fine. I\'m the one who suggested we take the offer to move because I trusted the people and I regret it now. I wish I would have just stayed living in my apartment I had before. My partner and I were only a few months away from getting our own place, and now I can\'t help but feel like I screwed everything up for us. I just don\'t know what to do now.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Roommates Trouble.', 'created': 1574476678.0}"

2019-11-22 23:56:30,e09q80,5,1,"Hello all,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this sort of question. If not, apologies, I'm having a hard time figuring out the role of each one of the trans-related subreddits.

Cis pan female ally here. A few years ago, my (also cis) boyfriend's friend and co-worker (in their late 30s), who had identified as a cis gay man until then, started realizing they might be trans. Over the next months/years, she started HRT, got top surgery, went through all the hoops that the government was requesting to change her name and gender on all her ID and papers, and finally got bottom surgery last month.

We were there for her the whole time, supporting her every step of the way. I went shopping with her for feminine clothes and makeup for the first time, I helped her with general makeup/hair/clothing tips, and she seemed to be feeling better and better as her transition advanced, except those days when the hormones really messed with her emotional state. We supported her through her breakup—her boyfriend remains a very close friend, but in the end, he's gay and attracted to men, so the romantic side of their relationship kind of came undone. More recently, we visited her almost every day after she got her reassignment surgery. It was a rough business, she went through so much pain, and she seemed to be reacting way worse than the other patients there (the nurses said so and it was also quite apparent).

Only a week after the whole ordeal, she was already walking back on her decision. Her therapist told her it was a normal process and lots of trans people have a period of regret after the surgery, but eventually this feeling subsides. Myself, I had never heard of this phenomenon, but I trusted what the therapist said and told my friend to bide her time. After all, she had taken YEARS to transition to living full time as a woman. What was a few more weeks? But she was adamant, to the point that she told her therapist she would stop seeing them unless they told her what she wanted to hear and supported her in her decision to de-transition. Eventually she did stop seeing the therapist, I guess she wasn't being told what she wanted to hear.

When I asked her what motivated her decision, she said it had nothing to do with her identity. She still felt them same. But she said she hated the way she was being treated as a trans woman, and had a much better quality of life when she lived as a gay man, and so she just wanted that quality of life back. One month later she has already travelled back to Venezuela where she is from (we are in Canada and she lives here now), to get her breast implants removed. The surgery just happened this week. She tried to get her ID changed back to her former name and gender, but the government is blocking it for now. (I'm still using ""she"" because she says she doesn't care which pronoun people use.) I think she will have to jump through a bunch of hoops once more to get everything reversed.

I have no idea how to support her. I'm terrified of saying anything because I don't know if I'm helping or hurting her. What if she's rushing in this de-transition at a time where she's vulnerable, and by supporting her I'm only encouraging her in making a decision she might regret? Or what if this is really the path for her and by questioning her, I'm only alienating her and bringing her down? I have no idea what's the right thing to do. I'm worried for her, and I want her to be happy, and to support her. I just don't know how to best do this right now.

So my transmasc friend and I were discussing using the restroom at work the other day and we both agreed on a few things...

If you start a new job no matter what your degree of transition you should immediately start using your restroom of choice from the beginning and do not ask permission. 

When you are using the restroom it’s best if you own it. Walk in there and act like you deserve to be there. Try your best to be as casual as everyone else.

In my own experience I found that it works better if you’re not timid or shy. At least in my case since I am male to female I learned that ladies talk to each other in the restroom. Be courteous and polite and if someone engages you in conversation try to follow through. 

In my experience it’s best to just act like you’ve been doing this forever and it’s completely normal. 

You don’t need to be militant about it but this behavior may help take some of the spotlight off of you and puts the burden of acceptance on others.

2019-11-24 00:10:50,e0qmmf,19,1,"Hi! Im an 18 year old open minded.... something or other? So we all know stereotypes right and how children typically are right? Boys like blue, girls like pink right? (In general) Well as per the advice of my people on the bisexual teens reddit, kik, amino and an irl friend I've been told to experiment after spilling my guts out to them. I.e having struggling with my sexuality for a few years and frequently throughout my life question my gender though not having the awareness I do now.

Up until a year or two to go I doubled down on the idea that I'm just a straight white dude with somewhat of a wandering eye.. I wouldn't say I liked trans or men to my friends or family but there was something there. (I mean, I'd fantasise, read erotica and watch porn, research it ect). Now feel free to point this out if its stereotypical or me trying to point my finger at things I dont quite understand. As a kid (stereotypical?) And to a greater extent now I didnt and never have fit in, I was bullied because of that. I liked long hair and secretly I wanted so badly to be girly.. I loved pink and wanted to play with girls more than boys.. 

I grew up in a quite diverse area of Britiain, my friends were from all over but one of my closest friends was a pale poor-posh boy (who later turned out to be a treacherous asshole) and a jamaican tomboy (who later turned out to be a lesbian), we often played together and this is where my childhood gets very wierd. Me and the tomboy where quite close, I mean we knew each others parents names and we played out until it was pitch black. She really showed me how different I was to the other boys at my school, in fact she was more boisterous if truth be told and I always felt feminine around her. We were way too close as well, like weirdly. I had a few things, as did she, happen to me very early in childhood that sparked something quite wrong, we never 'you know' but yeah..

There were a few years were I prayed to god to make me a girl, I wanted a boyfriend and to have a baby and to be were a dress.. I even contemplated using a pair scissors to you know.. I wanted those things so much I cried but time moves on and memories and friends fade away. It wasnt until I was 14 when these things back. (Quick timeline this is messy, preschool to infantry school and junior is when most of this happened), I was in high school and the bullying was different, it stepped up a level. My friends came and went, I still had long hair and my large group of friends dwindled down to one who was addicted to xbox and a bit of a loner.

There was a girl (always is) a goth-emo hybrid who sort of became a hero of sorts in my eyes after I had a major panic attack when some people were picking on me. We never really chatted but we sat together in class and she was my real first crush, so real my heart ached every time I saw her and the few times she smiled at me. To cut things up a bit, I rarely attended school for almost two years and a bit after I was told I had social anxiety.. which only made things worse. She pulled me out of the gutter and helped me back to school. I cried on her shoulder, held her hand tight when I felt I was gonna loose it and always made an effort to be there for her. I started doing things to myself which I regretted instantly, i fell into a dark depression and she helped me stop. I took on her fashion and for the first time in years.. I wanted to be a girl.. I wanted my nails painted.. lipstick.. eye shadow.. skinny Jeans.. I wanted to be like her. My mom would straighten my hair and tell me I cant dye it black, she also had the patience to paint my nails the few times i did it before i got bullied for it.

We fell out over some stupid cunt who lied to us both and soon became Facebook friends. She has a kid now and sometimes my heart still bleeds for her. Which brings us roughly to now.. a fucking wreck. I dont know how I feel, old habits die hard, I'm struggling with everything and I'm going nowhere in life. I hate the way I look, I want and need to be more feminine, I still have long hair btw, I've been with a few men and a couple women.. but I still don't know. I've talked with gender fluid people, trans men, crossdressers. I watched countless videos and read more blogs than I care to admit. Now after this long winded, almost novel length story my question is, does any of this link up with other trans stories? Does this make sense, is this how you felt? I need to know, maybe then I can get some semblance of something to hold onto, to slowly fix myself. If you have stayed and read this long enough.. you deserve a fucking reward. I've heard a lot of people who are quite honest do say some things to get their treatment and stuff.. but i wouldn't know too much and I'd also like to say that my parents arent against anything. They wouldn't care but I fear it may change things.. my mother always wanted a girl and my dad always had boys.. but for one girl. I wasn't hurt or anything as a child but I saw and heard things I suppose children shouldn't.

I try to be active within my communities, helping to organize existing events, moderating discussion and resource groups. I have also recently started to stream on Twitch, where I share my love of gaming and singing while discussing mental health, queerness, polyamory and disability.

I plan to return to school once I am financially stable, so that I can pursue a degree in theatre; this focus would include all of the skills I'm aiming to hone, including delegation of tasks, interpersonal communication, and emotional evocation. Presently, I cannot afford the books and fees that would not be covered by the FASFA, especially because I would likely need to remain a part-time student (9 credits or less a semester). My grandfather, bless him, has been continuously growing a college fund that will pay for the direct tuition fees, granting me the ability to return to school if I can get the stability to cover the rest.

I am actively working on goals and objectives for the future while trying to make ends meet as I battle for SSI and proper treatment. My goals for when I am financially stable are as follows: 

\- Go back to university/college and graduate (made possible by my generous and loving grandfather, who can cover the tuition but additional prices, such as textbooks etc).

\- Create/produce educational programs and videos about my mental health, my snake, and how they're related.

\- Fundraise for my community (pay it forward/pay it back).

\- Organize/create community events such as TransCon Boston, Queer Spoon Cabinet, and others.

\- Advocate for consideration, recognition, safety, and fair treatment towards and within my community.

This month especially has brought significantly higher expenses in bills, student loan payments, and lack of usual DTA assistance (which I am in the torturously long process of fixing). In total for November alone, I need to raise $1007 more to stay afloat. This is a daunting, terrifying number, and one I cannot reach on my own. Please, if you have anything to spare, small donations come together and move mountains. Or, in this case, build survival rafts.

2019-11-25 15:40:50,e1hq3z,8,1,"This became more ranting then I intended I have a TL;DR at the end. 

Im 36 yo pre every thing mtf. My best freinds dad just came out as trans. This is a person who has been emotionally and physically abusive most of my friends life, we are both in out mis 30s. His dad has had major issues with drugs and alcohol, having gone through rehab and AA multiple times. They lost their job a few years ago and this sent them in to a major downward spiral. 
Now my friends dad is comming out as transgender mtf, I gave suspected it for years. She is now blaming all the problems theyve had on being a closeted trans. She says they cant blam her for any thing shes done because she was suffering. I gave sevr8ak points in this. 

So point one. I wanna call BS on that. Just because you are in the closet dows not mean you get a free pass on being an ass hole. God knows I did plenty of ass hole things befire I had my own realization, my wife will bw happy to lost them for you. This had nothing to do with me being trans it had to do with me being an ass hole some times.  Nothing nearly as bad as my freinds dad, and terry and find some one whos reached their mid 30s with our some ass hole in them.  

Point 2. I was hoping to come out to my best freind at some point.  Would have done it already but his wife is the words biggest gossip and a major terf, so I've been holding off. Now I'm even more reluctant to come out to my freind at the moment cause he seems to think all transgebder people are these ass holes. Just seems to have s negative impression of transgender. I'm hoping this is a gut reaction to the news and ut will fade in time. 

Point 3. I'm torn between being able to connect to another transgender person irl snd the fact that this person is a complete ass hole that I never really liked.  I currently
Have no irl transgender freinds are even know any all and its unlikely I'll be making any soon. I have like no free time, money is tight. Also I am like the worst person in the world at making freinds, it's a skill that's always alluded me. And here is another transgender person I can talk to and possibly relate to, but their such a horrible person in gential, also it would be betraying my freind. It's like I'm a dog and some keeps showing me a treat and pulling it away. 

Point 4. I'm pissed off this person will be starting hormones soon. Its alot easier wheb you have no job and your wife is fitting your bill for your BS life style. And I'm sitting here wondering if or when I'll be able to start cause I have a carrer I actully like. And yeah I'm a little jealous. 


So that's my struggle this morning. 


TL;DR 

My best freinds abusive father just came our as trans mtf. 
 Point 1. My freinds dad is blaming the fact that theyve been an abusive alcoholic and all around ass hole on the fact thats theyve been a closted transgender mtf. And I wanna call BS. 
Point 2. This makes it harder for me to come out because hes got a negative veiepoint/ association with transgenders now.

My best freinds dad just came out as trans. This is a person who has been emotionally and physically abusive most of my friends life, we are both in out mis 30s. His dad has had major issues with drugs and alcohol, having gone through rehab and AA multiple times. They lost their job a few years ago and this sent them in to a major downward spiral. \nNow my friends dad is comming out as transgender mtf, I gave suspected it for years. She is now blaming all the problems theyve had on being a closeted trans. She says they cant blam her for any thing shes done because she was suffering. I gave sevr8ak points in this. \n\nSo point one. I wanna call BS on that. Just because you are in the closet dows not mean you get a free pass on being an ass hole. God knows I did plenty of ass hole things befire I had my own realization, my wife will bw happy to lost them for you. This had nothing to do with me being trans it had to do with me being an ass hole some times.  Nothing nearly as bad as my freinds dad, and terry and find some one whos reached their mid 30s with our some ass hole in them.  \n\nPoint 2. I was hoping to come out to my best freind at some point.  Would have done it already but his wife is the words biggest gossip and a major terf, so I've been holding off. Now I'm even more reluctant to come out to my freind at the moment cause he seems to think all transgebder people are these ass holes. Just seems to have s negative impression of transgender. I'm hoping this is a gut reaction to the news and ut will fade in time. \n\nPoint 3. I'm torn between being able to connect to another transgender person irl snd the fact that this person is a complete ass hole that I never really liked.  I currently\nHave no irl transgender freinds are even know any all and its unlikely I'll be making any soon. I have like no free time, money is tight. Also I am like the worst person in the world at making freinds, it's a skill that's always alluded me. And here is another transgender person I can talk to and possibly relate to, but their such a horrible person in gential, also it would be betraying my freind. It's like I'm a dog and some keeps showing me a treat and pulling it away. \n\nPoint 4. I'm pissed off this person will be starting hormones soon. Its alot easier wheb you have no job and your wife is fitting your bill for your BS life style. And I'm sitting here wondering if or when I'll be able to start cause I have a carrer I actully like. And yeah I'm a little jealous. \n\n\nSo that's my struggle this morning. \n\n\nTL;DR \n\nMy best freinds abusive father just came our as trans mtf. \n Point 1. My freinds dad is blaming the fact that theyve been an abusive alcoholic and all around ass hole on the fact thats theyve been a closted transgender mtf. And I wanna call BS. \nPoint 2. This makes it harder for me to come out because hes got a negative veiepoint/ association with transgenders now. \n\nPoint 3. I'm torn between being able to make a connection with another IRL transgender women, a first for me.

2019-11-26 07:41:09,e1up1j,11,1,"I don't know if this should be here, but I'm still shocked and hurt and at least one person needs to honour her for who she was.

I met a girl online, Ashleigh. At the time she was going by a different name. I found her by accident, while looking for dirt on a particularly nasty transphobe I had to interact with. A Reddit account with a similar username to the person I was searching's account. She had posts on r/trans, and some of them paralleled some of my own fears. She worried about her family, fearing that she wouldn't be accepted. She wondered if HRT would work for her, and hoped that her body shape would help her transition. She worried about where she would live, where she would work, if the worst happened and she got kicked out of her home. So I reached out to her.

She was the sibling of the person I despised, and that immediately interested me. How could two siblings be such polar opposites? We talked, ranted about her brother, got to know each other. I hadn't started HRT at that point and I we both discussed it eagerly, her wondering where she'd get the money and me wondering how I'd get a psychiatrist's approval. I found out she served in the army, and that she wanted to sing if she could ever get her voice high enough. I told her I was helplessly afraid of bloodwork, and discussed a guy who I was afraid would think I was flirting with him. It was probably the talking that built up her confidence, she changed her online profile to be female despite the risks, while still hoped her brother wouldn't find out.

A few weeks after, her brother did. He outed her to his entire Christian family, and convinced them to deny her transition. She didn't feel safe in her home anymore, and was struggling to find work so she could move out. Things turned around when she was able to get her first month of HRT. She was ecstatic, she told me it was like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders, that a fog had cleared. Life got busy for me and she messaged me less, so our conversations sort of dropped off from there. I thought she was happy. I thought she was okay.

On the 1st of November she asked me how I was doing. I said I was fine. She asked a few other questions, and I answered, but I didn't ask her how she was. I was panicking about money, worrying I would go broke, and I told myself I didn't have time to talk. I didn't hear anything from her after that. Tonight I found out she killed herself last Saturday. I saw an offhand post from her brother, still deadnaming her, still referring to her as male, saying that she killed herself because ""people on the internet convinced her the whole world and her family was against her."" He was the one that found her, and he wasn't even able to acknowledge that he caused it.

I don't think any of her family will remember her for who she was, and I don't think she had any other friends who knew. I'm not religious, but if I could say a few words to her, I'd say I'm sorry for not asking how she was. I'm sorry for prioritising myself above others. And I'm sorry for the situation she wound up in and the monsters she had to call family. I can't bear the thought of her dying with everybody remembering her as male, so I'm writing this in hopes that people will remember her the way she wanted to be remembered.

She worried about her family, fearing that she wouldn\'t be accepted. She wondered if HRT would work for her, and hoped that her body shape would help her transition. She worried about where she would live, where she would work, if the worst happened and she got kicked out of her home. So I reached out to her.\n\nShe was the sibling of the person I despised, and that immediately interested me. How could two siblings be such polar opposites? We talked, ranted about her brother, got to know each other. I hadn\'t started HRT at that point and I we both discussed it eagerly, her wondering where she\'d get the money and me wondering how I\'d get a psychiatrist\'s approval. I found out she served in the army, and that she wanted to sing if she could ever get her voice high enough. I told her I was helplessly afraid of bloodwork, and discussed a guy who I was afraid would think I was flirting with him. It was probably the talking that built up her confidence, she changed her online profile to be female despite the risks, while still hoped her brother wouldn\'t find out.\n\nA few weeks after, her brother did. He outed her to his entire Christian family, and convinced them to deny her transition. She didn\'t feel safe in her home anymore, and was struggling to find work so she could move out. Things turned around when she was able to get her first month of HRT. She was ecstatic, she told me it was like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders, that a fog had cleared. Life got busy for me and she messaged me less, so our conversations sort of dropped off from there. I thought she was happy. I thought she was okay.\n\nOn the 1st of November she asked me how I was doing. I said I was fine. She asked a few other questions, and I answered, but I didn\'t ask her how she was. I was panicking about money, worrying I would go broke, and I told myself I didn\'t have time to talk. I didn\'t hear anything from her after that. Tonight I found out she killed herself last Saturday. I saw an offhand post from her brother, still deadnaming her, still referring to her as male, saying that she killed herself because ""people on the internet convinced her the whole world and her family was against her."" He was the one that found her, and he wasn\'t even able to acknowledge that he caused it.\n\nI don\'t think any of her family will remember her for who she was, and I don\'t think she had any other friends who knew. I\'m not religious, but if I could say a few words to her, I\'d say I\'m sorry for not asking how she was. I\'m sorry for prioritising myself above others. And I\'m sorry for the situation she wound up in and the monsters she had to call family. I can\'t bear the thought of her dying with everybody remembering her as male, so I\'m writing this in hopes that people will remember her the way she wanted to be remembered.\n\nAshleigh, rest in peace.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Rest in peace, Ashleigh.', 'created': 1574779269.0}"

I am a cis woman, I think is the term. Although to be honest I don’t like it, I would rather refer to myself just as a woman. But for clarity I will use it.

I have great empathy for trans people, I also believe gender dysphoria is a terrible thing to have to suffer and I think everyone should have the right to identify as they please. 

However I also know men and women have very different physical abilities, it’s the reason men and women’s sports is separated. I have read that this split in abilities happens during puberty. Men develop bigger muscles, bones and heart size etc 

I read that of a trans woman transitions after puberty she keeps all these physical attributes even if her testosterone levels go down to a level more consistent with a cis woman. 
Which seems very unfair to me when it comes to competing together in sports.

But at the same time why shouldn’t trans woman have the right to compete competitively in sports. Would they even be able to compete with men if they are on hormonal medication that brings down their testosterone? 

Which leaves them where? 

On the other hand I do agree with the cis woman’s argument that it’s unfair, we have fought so long and hard for rights we never had, to be taken seriously in professional sports etc and it can feel like this is another form of patriarchal colonialism. (This is just my opinion not a fact) because woman just cannot physically compete with male bodies. 

What happens if all the top female athletes in the world are trans. Will cis women just give up trying to compete?

Now trans people have also being fighting for their own rights, and they deserve them. But in this case it feels like it’s at the expense of cis women.

Which again is also not fair to trans women, because when they are also amazing and talented and should be competing and showing their skills and hard work.

I feel so conflicted about this and I only see the cis woman’s perspective on you tube or wherever I look. So I would very much like to hear the trans woman’s perspective. 

Perhaps there is no easy answer to this, but I feel like I should hear how trans women feel about it.

2019-11-27 18:04:37,e2jxn9,6,1," I'm a 28 y/o Canadian male, and the trans individuals I do know, I know as part of a periphery, not on a close or intimate level, so I have never really made an opportunity to ask. I don't mean to be ignorant, and I have done some reading but I'd like to know more specifics. To my understanding, many of life's barriers, and obstacles which face trans people stem from social culture, and lack of recognition, or acceptance. There are some examples I know whereby in the past, some statutes, policies, etc have been prohibitive and/or restrictive to the transgender community which has denied some rights:

* The shared washroom debate, and a lack of neutral restrooms
* Some militaries, (maybe police forces, and correctional facilities) prohibiting or deliberately not hiring trans people. (I was briefly an RCMP officer, there were were 2 or 3 trans persons in training, so on that front, one police force I know, is attempting to make some progress)
* restrictions, or prohibitions on access to gender alteration surgeries

Governments can, and in some cases, have addressed these. What can they do better? Overall, what can governments do to benefit your quality of life? In terms of hiring practices, my intuition is that there are few work places which actively restrict/prohibit the hiring of trans persons. The adversity faced is largely cultural and based on employer bias. The only thing I can think of to actively combat this would be including trans persons into an affirmative action-esque system which while it has benefits, is also flawed.

Politicians can attend parades, events, and speak positively on behalf of trans to set examples, as I have witnessed in the past few years.

2019-11-28 02:30:17,e2r8v6,4,1,"Hello my name is India Chung. I am a 23 year old trans woman living in Belfast Northern Ireland, I suffer an incredibly intense form of dysphoria that causes me to suffer extreme mental breakdowns where I can't stop screaming or injuring my own face. I have been suicidal for the past 15 years, with it reaching an agonizingly oppressive point in the last 6. All of my problems stem entirely from my dysphoria, which I experience at a much more intense, and chronic level than most people. I have cut my face many times in the past, but never before with my bare hands like this. I am trying to crowdfund for facial surgery but it is incredibly difficult. The first time I tried to kill myself I was 7 and I tried to hang myself from my bunk bed with my mother's jeans. When I was 16 I got admitted to beechcroft for suicidal tendencies which was a horrible experience and left when I was 17. My extreme suicidal tendencies were too much for my family and I ended up having to live in a hostel. It was there I was sexually assaulted and started to suffer very serious anger management issues, for example I smashed several of the guitars the staff had bought for the residents and got kicked out for threatening the team leader with violence and nearly hitting her. I ended up moving into a better hostel and then I got an apartment where I now live with someone else. I have called lifeline many times in the past and could continue to and nothing will ever actually change, I will still be explaining the same problem to the same people over and over again. My mother could drop dead tomorrow and I would not care. In school I used to walk around with my face covered through all school hours unless I was alone. The school actually gave me my own separate room to help with this. I am 23. It is many years later. I tied a noose and went to go hang myself several months ago but it didn't work out. As my gender dysphoria increases in intensity so does my anger and frustration, and I fear I will start to direct it at other people again. I have cut ties with all of my real life friends besides two and I have contemplated physically assaulting them both. I am also waiting for my next mental breakdown so I can assault someone and use my breakdown as an excuse. I also often fear I may stab myself in the chest during one of these moments. I feel like I could go outdoors with a knife and get arrested and still just be sent home and nothing will change. I am too scared of jail to kill someone but I have regardless very strongly contemplated murder. If jail was not an issue however, I would definitely murder someone as an outlet for my frustration. It is only through a lifetime of different psychiatrists, living situations, and help, do I know that the only solution to my problems is facial surgery to halt my extreme suicidal dysphoria, as strange as it sounds. I would return to homebase to buy more rope but I am too scared to go outside. I cannot work but I wish I could. I cannot do many things I wish I could. Sometimes I wear masks both indoors and outdoors instead of cutting my face. Suicide is the only personal agency I have to end my dysphoria. I want you to know that I believe life is worth living. I just wish I had the opportunity to know what living actually is. I am a semi-permanent danger to myself and have the potential to become a danger to others. Right now everything is fine. I have contemplated removing my face with chemical burns and have soft attempted blinding myself without following through with the plan. I could hang myself from the doorknob with a scarf right now, but I can't escape the possibility of either facing permanent brain damage or living the rest of my life in a vegetative state. This gets to me. It is very hard to kill yourself when you genuinely don't want to. I would provide details of my address to the internet publicly, leave my door unlocked and request that somebody murder me but I have another person living with me and this is what stops me.

Oh, the sky is cold. The winter slow.
The earth has a flat chest.
And I am sorry that I am feasting on the Sweet N' Low
of the peddled prison I call home.

Conjuring the villains of a flat earth revelation
where everyone is wearing the hats of their own cremation 
because we know what their candles bring.
That a princess is only pretty when she is born in pink.
It doesn't matter if the flower that disguises her soul 
is blue as the moon and covered in stone;
Get the bills printed on his hand
And he'll grow up to be a stand up man.

Sometimes I scream at the sky
That mountain's too high.
My castle weighed down by laughs.
And I, like a butterfly, drifting on this sleeping cloud.
The hurricain doesn't drown them out.

A rainbow from the storm brings golden suffocation.
The horsemen ride on flushing contemplation.
Their the reasons the mirror cracked;
Never watching where they're going, 
only looking back. 
She's throwing stones trying to crack glass walls.
Buy they never shatter
And they only talk.
It might be the crows that disrupt the worth
because he didn't use a reflection when he thought of her.

So, the waterfall has begun to stall
But it trickles on the tree roots.
I, I'm sorry but I reject the hand that tells the truth 
from the peddled prison she can't break through.

So, the HRC (Human Rights Committee) just sent me some mail. It was basically one of their mildly aggressive ""join our membership so we can fight for *YOUR* rights as a person in the LGBTQ+ community!!!"" Had a sticker, membership card, everything. Awesome. Normally I'm really happy when this stuff shows up to my apartment, which is in a different state.

Except

This mail arrived at my parents NEW address

In my DeadName

Where I no longer live or legally reside. (Due to weird laws in the state I attend college/actually live, I can't become a state citizen until I am out of college, so my legal address is my grandparents' house). My parents moved a while ago, and I've never lived in this location. It isn't my legal address. I honestly didn't even know my parents' new address, I hadn't visited since they moved and I hadn't needed to mail anything to them.

My parents are highly homophobic and often snoop in my mail. I was ***THIS*** close to being outted by HRC. Ya know, the organization fighting for LGBT rights and ***SAFETY***? Yeah, *that* committee. The committee that just put my life in danger AND almost cut me off completely from my family. I'm in the closet for a GODDAMN REASON. I live in a completely different state.

I still depend on them in some ways for food and rent due to being unable to work full-time while I'm in college. Also, I'd like to maintain a relationship with my sister, who is a minor and would probably be banned from communicating with me if my parents disowned me. Also, Idk, maybe I haven't come to terms with the fact that my parents might not really love me for who I am so I'm afraid to cut that illusion off? but D*ON'T JUDGE ME on that part, THe point is that thAT'S MY DECISION,* ***NOT*** ***HRC'S.***

A little bit of bio and opening up:

- Explored sexuality as a teen by looking porn. Discovered I reacted to trans women (not all of them) and not to porn featuring cis women (or very rarely) and not at all to men. Ditched it scared as temporary thing and probably a fetish.

- Infatuated most of the time by cis women (even with butterfly sensations).

- Rediscovered transgender women at uni when friends made fun of pictures of them and realized I still reacted to them. Again scared I dissmissed it as something temporary and probably a fetish.

- Few experience with relationships (non with trans). Most long one with a cis-woman. Felt like something was missing a bit (sexually), although we were intimate really often and there was a lot of romantic attraction and even long term plans. Break up for other reasons.

- Find secretly asking myself if my crushes are trans.

- Rediscovered trans women again in mid twenties. Informed myself better, followed blogs from women transitioning, read forums, read Reddit, news, scientific publications, etc. Tried to avoid it again. Started to have more and more fantasies about them. Ended up kind of accepting that this in some way could be my orientation, yet still avoiding it mostly.

- I keep avoiding the topic as when I read about it I see mixed opinions on the internet. People that say this is objectification, fetish, this means one likes people for being trans and not the person, etc. And people that say that trans are mentally ill and need a cure. And it all confuses me.

- I have transphobic friends and relatives.

Right now I feel confused in part due to the fact that I do realize that I somehow have some level of transphobia probably. I mean, I do admit that I react sexually to trans women when I watch erotic content, but right now I can't shake my mind from the biologic reality, which in some way makes me avoid meeting them because the very same moment I think of them as men I get repulsed. And I don't know how to solve this to be honest. another point is I feel like dating transwomen asks for a psychological strength that I don't have right now and I feel I can't convince myself to do it. I empathize with the fact that no one wouldn't like to date someone that is not ready to date with them long term. I mean I am too scared to even talk with them at a cafe and risk being seen and what could happen next (work, family, friends, neighbors, etc.). And what if I discover I don't feel attracted to real life transgender women while dating one? I don't want to hurt someone emotionally, I think they have to deal with enough things on their life to add this icing of the cake on their emotional struggles. I feel like the more I try to avoid the topic, the more fantasies and feelings of wanting to do something about it I have. Right now I am young, average looking, healthy and with good career and studies. I feel like in the future I don't want to be one of those 40+ or 50+ old dudes that repulses 20 something transwomen.

I can't picture myself using grindr or tinder. I tried OkCupid for dating cis women but become too clingy easily, and I am too scared to approach a transgender woman, to a point I just tend to swipe them left due to all the anxiety it produces me (what if it's a scam?

2019-11-29 03:11:38,e38sda,0,1,"I had a bad break up in June, and y’all gave me good advice. I’m back because it’s haunting me. I kind of want to try to at least explain myself and hear my side of the story to be heard. I’m not expecting anyone to want to talk to me or anything but it would be nice. The guilt is eating me up inside and i can’t take it anymore.

Before I get started I just want to say, I’m truly sorry and want to apologize for any kind of pain I caused, I just couldn’t take anymore of not being the true me, and some of you did not take it as well as I had hoped. I’m sorry. I hurt some of you. There’s nothing I could ever do to make up for it.

For some reason today I decided to get answers for why mutual friends I had with Claire all kind of dropped me except for like 2. I snapped Taylor, the one that hasn’t unadded me or told me they never wanna speak with me and asked her. She told me that everyone hates me because “i broke Claire’s heart, painted her as a transphobe and left without saying bye”

I understand hating me because of point 2, but point 1 I feel is unfair. I don’t understand how I’m the one that broke her heart if she was the one that said I had to choose between her or being myself. How is that my fault if she still loved me and she left me because she couldn’t be with a woman, even saying earlier in the relationship she was bi.

Looking back on it, I basically told everyone that asked “she left me because I’m trans” which is kind of true but not really? So I’ll take that one. I understand how you could interpret that as transphobic.

I left without saying bye because I saw that everyone was hanging out with her and not ever inviting me out, so I took that as they weren’t my friends anymore. To this day I can’t even see a picture of her without crying (it’s getting better tho, I’m almost to the point I can fight back the tears). So even after most of my identity crisis was “dealt with” (that’s the best way I could describe that), I did not want to see her in any capacity, especially with my friends. 

None you have to respond to this, and if you made it this far thank you for that, for listening to what I had to say, even if you think it’s complete bullshit. I have just had this guilt eating me up inside. If anyone wants me to elaborate on anything, I will. Most importantly, if this changed your opinion on me, don’t let it change your opinion of Claire. I don’t hate any of you.

2019-11-29 04:01:49,e39dvj,5,1,"Yesterday I was leaving the MAC counter at a nearby mall when I noticed a very tall woman approaching my direction. I’m a bit taller than I ever wanted to be (5’9”), so when I run into a woman taller than myself, I take notice. 

I made eye contact with her and she immediately looked away shyly. That’s when it became obvious to me that she was transitioning, and not for long. I knew, because I too had once been her. 

5 years ago, I felt unshakably certain that I could  no longer wait another day to live the rest of my life honestly. But all that honestly hurt a lot sometimes. When people would look at me funny or whisper to a friend, words that I couldn’t actually hear but I was certain would sound a lot like “look; check out that tranny in that green dress”, I really wanted to crawl up in a fetal position and cry for days. 

But I couldn’t do that. At least not in front of anyone else anyway. I was determined to ignore the mental simplicity’s of my community and just push myself to just learn something new about passing or failing every time I’d venture out into the public. 

I let my passing failures teach me. Malls were my classrooms. One of my shangri la’s was the MAC counter. I eventually learned to make that my first stop. That way I’d get one of the techs to do my face first before venturing out into stores. I’d also pick up makeup techniques every time. 

So, yesterday, I almost kept walking, not wanting to be disrespectful of this woman’s privacy. But something inside me needed to pass on some things I’d learned when I first transitioned. I wanted to pay it forward, and pass on some girl power mojo. 

So, I said “miss?” She turned, looking frightened as f**k. Then I whispered quietly so I didn’t draw attention to her, “I’m your sister babe, you and I are the same. If you want a friend, I’d be happy to show you around. If you prefer your privacy, I’m happy to leave.” 

She stuck her hand out as if to shake mine, her hand trembling, but her face was smiling from ear to ear. I just reached out to hug her which always works better for me. The hug worked. 

I walked her over to the MAC counter where I’d just left, still holding my bag of concealer, and I introduced her to the girl who regularly helps me and just said, “do you mind doing my friends makeup, I want her to try you’re brand to convince her how bad she needs to ditch her cover girl products.” That’s all it took. We found some eye shadow she liked and the rest was glamorous history. 

Afterwards, I walked with her through the mall and coached her a little more. We exchanged numbers and I left feeling like I’d cured cancer. I felt amazing. 

I’m not the most beautiful woman my mirror has ever seen for sure, mostly passable at best, but yesterday I knew, despite my own imperfections, that I needed to help her. Her shyness overtook my conscience and I knew she needed help. 

Hopefully, five years from today, she will do the same.",trans,Paying it forward,1575025309.0,"{'created_utc': 1575000109, 'id': 'e39dvj', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Yesterday I was leaving the MAC counter at a nearby mall when I noticed a very tall woman approaching my direction.

Joining the Navy has been a long time dream of mine, but she encouraged me to become a commercial pilot instead, so I could transition too. I realized what I really wanted in life, and despite desperate attempts from my family to stop me, I moved out and am now on track to live with my gf in a few months and hormone therapy. My first appointment is Dec 11th, just two weeks from now.

I'm really excited and a tad bit scared, but know this'll be a great thing for me. The past year has been a bit of a hell, but things really are looking up. Don't worry dudes and dudettes, it gets better.

Plus, I talked to my mom recently and told her how upset their unacceptance has made me, and she used my new name on a letter she sent me. I never thought I'd see this kind of day.

So a good few years back, I came out to my parents as being bi. All was well, their only concern was ""putting a label on it."" But they were fine about it, my dad is a lot more supportive in what I do though. So naturally when I stopped repressing my trans thoughts (over the course of 6-7 years or so, I had thoughts of being trans but always pushed them down and told myself to be a man or whatever.) a couple months ago, I told my dad before my mom. Again, he said I shouldn't put a label on it, but was actually helping me find a medical professional to talk to about all that. It was a hard conversation, but my dad listens much more than he speaks, and when he does speak, it's something meaningful and thought out. My mom is the opposite, she talks over me, interrupts me, and just says every thing that enters her head. Oh, and what with being depressed and all the dysphoria stuff I've had for 6 or 7 years, I've lost any semblance of self confidence. So I doubt myself a lot, in everything I think and say and do. There's barely ever a time I'm 100% sure of something. I'm really really really pretty sure I'm trans though, so I wanted to at least talk to a professional about it and see what I could do if I am. So I told my dad, yaddah yaddah, next day my mom can tell something's on his mind so he texts me to ask if it's okay if he talks to her a little bit about it. Y'know, since they're married and stuff. So I said along the lines of ""yes, but if you can avoid it, do so."" She knew at least part of it, when I got around to finally telling her last night (after putting it off for weeks because I thought this would happen) and honestly I've never felt worse about all this. I even opened up more than I ever have with them, in more ways than one. I touched upon stuff I hadn't told a single soul, and my mom just bounced it back at me with shit like ""how can you be sure?""

Now, I will admit, I'm a shut in. I don't like to be, but I'm dealing with a lot, and I thought I'd found the root of a lot of my problems. (The whole trans thing, that is.) So my mom's logic is basically: because I don't get out enough, I can't know I'm trans. So I *want* to say to myself ""Yeah, I'm sure about all this and I should stand my ground"" or whatever.

The actual post is stupid and barely related, but it sparked a flame war in the comments.

Important notes: I am not trans and have never knowingly met a trans person either in person or through the internet, which is why I wanted to post this. I also cannot stress enough that you don't go and harass this person. Sure, they're opinions are pretty dumb, but harassing him will only allow him to bury himself deeper into his anti-trans hole.

I continued by telling him that was based on nothing, but he wouldn't have any of it.

Basically, what I want is to know whether taking part in this argument was a good idea and whether I went about it correctly, having never met a trans person and not being one myself.

2019-11-30 21:07:40,e43hs9,8,1,"hello! I'm kinda stuck in a bit of a dilemma and I think advice and help from trans people is the best option
I'm an 18 year old female but since I was about 10 I always had the idea that I 'wanted to be a boy'. Any online games I'd play I'd end up making a male character, I was really into the idea of crossdressing and I was not very feminine (nor was I masculine tbh) and at times when people would give me nicknames or something I'd always go by the male version (idk how to describe it without it sounding weird but friends used to call me things like 'king' and 'dad' lol)

I never really thought about it tbh but within the past year I'd say? I've been constantly fantasizing about what it'd be like to be a boy and I've convinced myself I'd be so much more confident and happy if I was a guy. I got into more stereotypical feminine things like shopping and makeup, and from 14-16 I had no problems wearing skirts and girly clothes. Though now I feel extremely self conscious wearing dresses and I only feel comfortable wearing one skirt I own, but this is only on days I feel good about my appearance lol.
Typically I wear oversized boys shirts and hoodies tucked into jeans but I've been really wanting to buy more mens pants and appearing less feminine. I've also always been insecure about showing my breasts lol, I'd never wear shirts or things that show cleavage and always cover it up fully but idk if thats really relevant
I've started to experiment with my appearance and I think I'm going to cut my hair short.

Honestly, the idea that I might be trans never crossed my mind until recently. I feel as though 18 is too old to realise and I don't think I experience dysphoria? I honestly think I'm insecure of my body bc its not as nice as other girls i know irl and my face isn't conventially attractive but I can't stop fantasizing about being a guy.

2019-11-30 23:36:35,e45oi9,1,1,"The song Reflection from Mulan is literally such a trans anthem! I’ve legitimately nearly cried while listening to it. In case y’all don’t know, these are the lyrics: 
Look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be I'm not meant to play this part 
Now I see
That if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight, back at me
Why is my reflection someone I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When will my reflection show who I am inside
When will my reflection show who I am inside

Let’s unpack this. 
First off, Mulan sings “ I will never pass for a perfect bride or a perfect daughter.” I mean, come on. Self-doubt related to “passing”!? Sounds pretty trans🤭
Next, Mulan asks “ Can it be I'm not meant to play this part”. I see this as Mulan fully realizing the possibility of being trans.
After this, Mulan says “Now I see
that if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart.” Obviously Mulan lives in ancient China where everyone probably didn’t like trans people. Mulan knows that coming out is not an option.
Next Mulan asks “ Who is that girl I see
staring straight, back at me”. I see this as Mulan being so confused that looking in a mirror shows someone unrecognizable.
The last part goes like this:”Somehow I cannot hide who I am though I've tried.
When will my reflection show who I am inside?” This is basically just Mulan wanting so badly to be true to her desires, but at the same time knowing that it’s necessary to hide it.

A lot of the movie also hints at this, and I’m excited to see what y’all think!
