I realize I can Google most of this info but I'd rather get advice from people who've experienced estrogen HRT and or top surgery. But here's some things I'm curious about. Apologies for anything triggering.

1) I already have pretty stereptypically ""feminine"" features (softer jawline, bigger lips, rounded face, and a not very prominent Adam's apple), would HRT be redundant when I can often pass? Would I be better off just getting hair removal and some minor cosmetic surgery?

2) If I do HRT, what can I expect? I've heard about losing muscle mass and I know it makes you sterile.
I'm fairly active so the muscle mass might not be a huge issues (I do like my smallish muscles as they give me a semi-butch look). I've already determined I don't want children so sterility doesn't scare me. I figure I can freeze some sperm if I have second thoughts. 
Will I gain weight? Will it be harder to avoid belly and thigh fat as I get older? Are there emotional side effects? I assume so since hormones have a lot to do with your emotional responses.

3) If I get breast implants, will I lose sensation in my nipples? I know this might be an odd concern, but my nipples are a major erogenous zone, part of what makes me feel like I was ""supposed"" to have breasts. Losing that sensitivity kind of worries me. I've heard of cis women having issues with nipple sensitivity after a boob job, but these could be low quality procedures or urban legends. 

4) What happens if I detransition? Will my body revert to its pre-transition state? Will my chest go flat again? Will I start growing heavier body hair again? I feel kinda silly asking all this stuff, especially at my age.

5) Speaking of age, is there an ideal range for medical transition? I'm sure the older I get the harder it will be to recover from the surgical aspects, but could the HRT also give me trouble? AMAB people start to lose testosterone around their 40s right? And that's usually when AFAB people would be hitting menopause, so I don't know what that means for someone transitioning in their late 30s-early 40s.

This past month, I've managed to pull together 1100 dollars outside of what is budgeted so that I could take care of my guitar and start playing again, buy some essential toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, and maybe some bath stuff, and most importantly clothes and makeup. Part of it came from severance that was long overdue from a shitty situation with a previous employer, then from selling stuff that was important to me but was worth it to do something nice for myself for once.

Somehow, every single time I had any money in my hand, it had to immediately go right back out. I had to jump in and cover gaps because most people around me can't budget and we constantly were short on necessary funds. Moreover, it wasn't readily apparent that this would be something that would leave me extremely upset, and I had to point out and explain just why I would be so bothered by it. Like, look guys, I know I'm the one that keeps this family out of the shit and moving toward improvement and cares for everyone, but I have desires and feelings too. I know it's easy to not notice me, but come the fuck on, really? Even my romantic partners?

Between this, struggles with depression and isolation, struggles with not being able to work because of fatigue, I'm just done with this past month. I told my wife if the money situation doesn't sort itself out and the group come together instead of trying to each be an island to themselves, I was out. It shouldn't be the two most depressed members of the group carrying everyone else, while the other two callously blow money on bullshit. I submitted a financial plan for the entire house because this is not happening again, and if it does, I'm jumping ship.

I just wanted to get some fucking clothes. Do something nice for myself for once in my life instead of putting everything I have into the care of others. Just some fucking clothes with money I got on the side so as to not depend on someone else for something that serves only me. 1100 dollars.

But hey, at least I got 6 sets of strings for my guitar, a cleaning set for it, and am playing again. (Until the pots on it fucked right off soon after and I had to open a credit line to pay for a simple repair since SOMEHOW I don't have any money)

Oh, and some cheap deodorant and cheap shampoo and conditioner because I refused to not at least buy that for myself.

tl;dr - I raised 1100 dollars of money for myself to buy clothes, necessities, and a couple other things, but because of poor financial discipline of two partners in the house, almost none of it went to me, and I'm extremely upset over it.",trans,"Okay, it stopped being funny the fifth time it happened...",1567379538.0,"{'created_utc': 1567354338, 'id': 'cybuo4', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ""&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fb7cxdkkb0k31.png\n\n \n\nThis past month, I've managed to pull together 1100 dollars outside of what is budgeted so that I could take care of my guitar and start playing again, buy some essential toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, and maybe some bath stuff, and most importantly clothes and makeup.

So yeah I'm like a toddler in terms of how I should act what I should do to be femenine and all that stuff

So um first of all I always knew I was bisexual even before knowing I was trans, so it usually never gave me any insecurities saying out loud that I liked both the puss and the dicc, until recently I been seeing some comments on stuff i watch to inform myself about, well myself, and I found its commonly bad seen for a tgirl to be a lesbian, while I'm not a lesbian per say, I'm technically half lesbian, so like it feels like I'm being forced to only look at half the people I like... Not that it makes much of a difference on my dating life since I'm still a fucking virgin, although that is mostly because it's uncomfortable and really easy trying to get lost of that you're supposed to do in those situations.

So yeah, uh question 1 I guess?

 Is it alright for a tgirl to also like girls?



Next I would like tackle the little doubt I have about how far should I take it with my transition

I'm extremely lucky for I pass even without having hormones on me, I just need a good depilation and you won't know what I have between my legs unless I open my mouth, curse you puberty!, because of this I focus myself more on the voice training, the make-up and the clothes part of which I'll tackle later, but again it appears to be common that unless you get hormones for 5 years and you do the snip snap to that meaty deformed looking lil guy between your legs, cis people and elitist lgbt+ people wont treat you with the respect they would otherwise, even if when they first met you they said ""she"" because they didn't even know you were trans at all...

2019-09-02 01:53:16,cyiqc8,7,3,"Okay, quick background summary before I get into this: I'm AMAB transfemme nonbinary, and I started HRT 8 months ago, in my late thirties.

I don't expect any easy answers here, but it would really help if others shared their own experiences...? It would be really validating. 😊 I'm hoping to hear from trans women, nonbinary people, and perhaps even AFAB members decribing their own contrasting experience.

Here's what's on my mind:

--------

I started progesterone a few weeks ago, and my breast development has picked up. Part of me is happy about this, but it's also a big adjustment and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I keep looking down and asking myself “do I want this permanently?...” I like the changes to how I look, but some thoughts keep getting in my way.

The first thought is obvious: the memory of being raised in a society that says “you shouldn't have breasts!!” Sooo, knowing how people might react scares me a little. I don't even care so much what people on the street *think,* but I do worry what people will *do,* and how it will affect my professional and personal life. I'm hoping people's way of thinking continues to catch up with us, but it may or may not happen quickly enough. 😞

The second is a bit more insidious. You see, I was skinny as a rail in high school, but since then I've gained 20-30 pounds. With that extra weight came filled-out breasts. Some transfemmes *like* this, but to me they were “manboobs,” so it gave me what might've counted as dysphoria.

Consequently, when I feel my chest fill out under my arms as the breast tissue spreads, I can't help but partially associate it with male weight gain. :/ I'm hoping that continued growth — especially filling out underneath — will help me to subconsciously separate these two types of chest bulk.

Lastly, there's just the fact that they're naturally a little sore and tender during development, and that discomfort hampers the gender euphoria I'm otherwise experiencing. :/

I would appreciate your input and personal stories! ❤️❤️❤️",trans,Uncertainty over recent breast development,1567414396.0,"{'created_utc': 1567389196, 'id': 'cyiqc8', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""Okay, quick background summary before I get into this: I'm AMAB transfemme nonbinary, and I started HRT 8 months ago, in my late thirties.\n\nI don't expect any easy answers here, but it would really help if others shared their own experiences...?

Second post on here, I think it'll do better. I've seen rant posts so I kind of just want to share my experience because why not. It feels good to know that people might see this, and maybe learn from my experiences. So here it is: 

My parents suck. They just do. If I was cis, my mom would have no problem supporting me(she's said it herself. Come out as bi/les–NO PROBLEM! Come out as her son, oh man, it's all going down.) As mentioned in the parentheses, a few weeks ago, I had the semi-courage to send an extremely lengthy text conveying my wish for being her son. I realise I shouldn't have said this. I should have said I WAS her son, not WISHED to be. Aside from that, she texted back a few minutes later that she didn't understand but that she would always support me. Weight lifted off of my shoulders, right? Absolutely wrong. When I got back from my mini-vacation, my mom told me that I couldn't get my hair cut as short as I wanted to because of my father. I cried, alright, because my hair is one of the primary sources of my dysphoria, unfortunately. My hair makes me look so dang feminine with my  A L R E A D Y  feminine features. Cue some more crying and I finally re-bring up the subject of my coming out saying that I hated being a girl and I hated my name because at that point I just snapped like a rubber band. I went in the backyard and blared some of my music, as peaceful as my music is(lol). A few minutes later I got a text from my mom saying that I would always be a girl, I'd always be Magnolia, and nothing could that. She said ""I hope you'll find a way to come to terms with yourself"" and ""God doesn't make mistakes"". Oh boy, I was like a bull that had seen red after the God statement. In anger, I texted my non-binary friend, who was the first person I came out to(In a Bath and Body Works, mind you). They are a super amazing person, who I've ranted to quite a bit, had quite a few midnight convos with. Anyway, my mother came outside to a sight of me crying. Quite angrily. I was just plain mad at her. Well, she sat down and said that God made me a girl for a reason and all that(basically rephrasing her texts) and that it was still ""us against the world"" I said that it wasn't anymore because she wouldn't accept me and she just replied with ""God doesn't make mistakes you put these ideas in your head yourself"". Of course, I couldn't believe she'd take the words of some imaginary being over her own SON. That's right, for those of you in the back, I said son. So that was the final straw in me becoming an atheist, but yeah, I went inside and to my room ready to get out. To go away. I was packing my bags while texting one of my friends to ask where I could go. Well, that day ended and I didn't run away and now we're here, a little more than a month later, and I'm still enduring every misgender and deadnaming. It's hard, it truly is. I hate the stupid nickname that she calls me every time she wants to summon me. (KK is so ****ing stupid and if I hear it again I'm going to explode) I hate my dad being so transphobic. I hate every time someone in my family says that I'm a girl and I'll always be one like do you know I have the power to change that when I'm eighteen and oh boy, believe me, I will! One day I will get surgery and hormones and you're gonna feel like a dang fool ain't ya? One day I'll refuse to be deadnamed, I'll move to a different country if I have to. I wanted to join the military but well, I'm not sure if that foolish ban'll be removed by the time I'm eighteen. I can serve my country just as well as the next guy, but the people who make a bad name for us truly make me feel less patriotic. How can I be proud of us as a nation if we're reverting back to the same way we were a hundred years ago? I can't even come out to my parents(again) in fear of what they'll do. I wish they would kick me out, I really do. I have a wonderful best friend who's willing to take me in and I would much rather live with their family than mine. Why did it have to turn out like this, anyway? I'm not sure when I'm ever going to fully happy again and the adults blame it on ""teenage hormones"", which I absolutely hate. For telling the doctor my true feelings I was scolded, told to quit acting ""depressed"" when I wasn't. When ""that wasnt me"". I'm sorry mother/father, have you been in my head? Have you despised being born the wrong way? No, exactly! My parents aren't even willing to try to understand, aren't even trying to help. My mother ignored my coming out, acting like it never happened, like it doesn't exist. My father's too afraid of my hair being short because I'll ""look like a d*ke""(sorry I censored, I just find the word offensive because it's just plain rude). I try to tell him that millions of girls(although I'm not one ;)) have their hair short and they aren't homosexual. Older women? Apparently all have a raging case of gay to my father. I hate fighting wars to just be who I am. Why can't I have suits? Why can't I be myself? I am so tired of having to live life as a girl at my house and getting so much backlash for my apparently ""fake depression"" that I just want a break.  I'm not trying to flaunt ""oh uWu I'm a dEpreSSeD sM0L bEaN"", I just want to feel better and right now music is the only thing that can take me away from my drifting. I feel like I'm just drifting through a sea of seeking. I always want to be doing something, I always want to be busy. I can't help it and it eats at me constantly. I'm trapped in my small town though (with a population of 6000 or 16000, last time I checked). I want to get in my dream car and keep driving until I reach safety, until I reach acceptance, but right now the only place where I feel I'm semi-accepted is school. Funny, how much I want to be there sometimes. I'm just tired of never feeling satisfied, of always looking for something. I just want to be called a son, for the first time. I want to be treated as an individual, not a statistic(what I feel like I am in my parents eyes–just another ""troubled youth"" who wants to rebel). I just want to feel like myself.

I salute you if you've read all of this, and I hope you have a safe rest of your days. We might never cross paths, you and I, but you, stranger, have just read my feeling poured out on a body of text. You might not know it, but you helped. It helps knowing I don't carry a burden alone sometimes, (and my poor NB friend shouldn't have to listen to my ranting 24/7).

However, there are problems. I don't live with them, but my family is mostly comprised of devout Southern Baptists. I know they're still good people, but I'm certain they'll at least partly shut me out if I even begin to transition. Also, I have OCD, which causes me to care WAY too much about passing. Unfortunately, that would be very difficult for me, as I've put on substantial muscle over the years and have a natural bass voice. (I have tried voice training, but to almost no effect.)

I'm trapped between two kinds of self hatred. I don't know if I would be happy as a woman, or even an enby, but my desire to change ratchets up week by week. I see my psychiatrist tomorrow, but wait times are huge, so I probably can't see a therapist that she'd recommend for weeks or months.

I know they're still good people, but I'm certain they'll at least partly shut me out if I even begin to transition. Also, I have OCD, which causes me to care WAY too much about passing. Unfortunately, that would be very difficult for me, as I've put on substantial muscle over the years and have a natural bass voice. (I have tried voice training, but to almost no effect.)\n\nI'm trapped between two kinds of self hatred. I don't know if I would be happy as a woman, or even an enby, but my desire to change ratchets up week by week. I see my psychiatrist tomorrow, but wait times are huge, so I probably can't see a therapist that she'd recommend for weeks or months. I've decided to shave regularly and keep my hair long, but I don't think that will be enough.\n\nThank you for reading.

2019-09-02 20:03:29,cyu73i,5,1,"TLDR - question what helped you come out when you knew it was inevitable but you were still scared?

Hey I feel like I could use some advice from anyone who feels like sharing so im just going to throw this out there with minimal preamble.

So I am a 24 year old biological male who has been playing with the idea of undergoing MtF hormone thereapy. I had begun crossdressing in private as soon as  I moved out from my parents place for college but for a lo g time just figured it was a kink or just somthing I had enjoyed but not actually part of me.

 Where im struggling is that though I know there is no one box to fit all trans people in or any ""correct"" way to be trans I felt that i didnt fit into the expectations most people think about what a trans person is like. Im not attracted to men, not into pink dresses, I never felt like playing with dolls as a kid, that kind of thing so I figured I can crossdress as a hobby and everything would just be fine. However now I feel more and more that I'm having a hard time starting relationships or getting very close to freinds feeling as though is anyone got too close to me as a person they will figure out my secret and ill be be ousted as some kind of pervert or some nonsense like that.

As it stands I am coming to terms with my gender identity and trying to live more open and authentically. For the first time in my life I have been thinking very seriously about coming out and transitioning but I feel as though i am trapped somewhere between knowing that I cant keep living in secret and simultainiously terrified about how my life will change and the challenges I would face once I come out. Im sure the majority of my family would support me or at the very least be civil but im scared about work, freinds, will I be passable, can I get a feminine voice down all the standard stuff.

With that in mind if anyone out there lived a similar situaltion to mine and wants to share what was it that pushed you past the fear of coming out?

2019-09-03 04:04:21,cyzsys,0,4,"My Trans Life...
It is hard not to think about it as of late as it seems to be the only thing that ever gets talked about or recognized. I would like to say a few things about this. To all. 
I don't know how many times I have been told that I should be proud that I am transgender. I should be proud of coming out. I should be proud that I ""pass"" as a woman. Can I say that being transgender just fucking sucks? 
At least when I wasn't out, it was mine. Mine to hold. Mine to protect. Mine alone. Now that I am out I have lots to worry about. Let me say that this isn't a fad. This isn't trendy. This isn't cool. This isn't just something to be. It's hard. And it's hell. And more often than not, it is not full of unicorns, sunshine, daisies, and rainbows. It isn't always successes and wonderful transition photos. 
No, it's the sleepless nights. The endless thinking about my fears. It's the wondering if I should and can or will use a public restroom. Or which restroom should I use. 
It's the constant reminders of my childhood past and how I was treated horribly. It's the having to constantly come out to medical providers, insurance providers, bosses, coworkers, therapists, program coordinators, lovers, new friends, strangers, practically everyone I meet. It's about being asked all the time ""how did you know and when."" It's about being asked what's between my legs rather than what's in my heart and mind. 
It's losing family because their religious beliefs and personal opinions view me as a sin, an abomination, a freak, an outcast, a loser, a mistake. It's looking into my parents eyes as a child and seeing their disgust, disapproval, shame, guilt, and embarrassment. It's the acceptance of my cis friends who mean well and think it's cool but don't have an inkling of what I go through or what i've been through the last 22 years of my life. 
It's the confusion of maybe dating men because they get concerned that they will be considered gay for dating a trans woman. It's dealing with the butterflies and anxiety in my stomach when I have to show my ID and my appearance doesn't match the documents. It's the realization that I will never have the financial or insurance status to get the painful surgeries to transition my body into a woman physically, so I can at least feel a sense of comfortability in my own damn skin. It's the cold hard truth of waking up every morning in a body that was never mine to begin with and looking in the mirror and being disgusted and disappointed by what I see because it does not match how I feel on the inside. Or by the lack of cleavage or hips and the sound of my voice that always gives me away even if I am all dressed up in female attire. It's about being stuck in the middle between my birth sex and my authentic gender. 
It's about having to go through puberty and childhood again, but this time at lightning speed with no guidance but my own experience and insight. It's about being reborn and having to grow up again because I never really was out in the first place to begin with because I got stuck with a family, that no one can choose, who disowned me and devalued my worth as a girl. It's about going out everyday in this evil fucking world knowing I will never be safe or secure because I had a family and have a society that taught me and continues to teach me that their opinions and views of me are more important than my own. 
It's the worrying about the creeps that may want to feel me up or hit on me to see if I have all the parts to match. It's the constant hypervigilance of those haters that want to really hurt me or kill me for being transgender because it so happens. It's always going out with my knife and pepper spray ready to stream as to feel some sense of safety and protection. It's about the never ending and repeating of facts by society that tell me why I am not a woman and never will be. It's being told that I don't have ovaries or fallopian tubes or a vagina or eggs therefore I can't give birth to a baby. It's the knowing and constant realistic and biological reminder that yes I don't have the parts to have a baby. Therefore I will never be able to give birth to my own baby, my own child, my own blood. And know what it is like to have a beautiful person growing inside of me and to be so close to someone for 9 whole months and watch my tummy grow and be so proud of such an experience and a blessing. It's knowing that I will never be a true mom in society's or the world's eyes. It's being told that I don't menstruate or don't have periods so I can't know what it is to be a woman. 
It's the objectification and worrying about why men look at me like a sex object and thing they have every right to lok at me like that and just degrade my humanity and womanhood. It's the looks and comments from cis women or cis men and the feeling of disgust and hatred from the two things. It's being called a monster, freak, whore, cunt, wannabe, fake, tranny, fag/faggot, queer, sex offender, sinner, gay, mother fucker, etc. 
It's the always to having to have my heart guarded and guard up because I know I can't afford to be viewed or considered weak or vulnerable. It's the self-loathing and constant hate for my body and self because I was taught to hide my true self and that I should be ashamed of that. It's having to build a whole new support network through social media and LGBTQ programs to replace the lack of acceptance from those I had loved or had a fucking responsibility to love and accept me because that is what a mother and father are supposed to do for their child. It's not so much about others' acceptance as it is the struggle to love myself when my family and the world continues to tell me otherwise.
There I finally said it. It's all out. In a nutshell. This is just one small part of who I am as I am made up of so much more. This is nothing to glamorize. Because when you really get down to it, I and others like me have some battle or fight or hell or obstacle that we have to go through just to be the people we have always known ourselves to be that many know nothing about. While dealing with the same, daily, regular, life stressors as our peers in our lives. So to all, be kind and gentle and compassionate to one another.

I know of someone whose major concern with getting bottom surgery (phallo) is the crazy scarring of the grafted area(s) and how obvious it can be that you've had skin taken for something.

He's already had top surgery, so it's not like an idea like this could help him, but I wonder for people who haven't had any surgery yet, would the skin from the breast area be viable for use to avoid taking skin from elsewhere and minimising what can be very bad scarring, assuming they want top surgery and are having that skin taken anyway.

I'm sure one drawback would be that you would need to have two surgeries in short succession which is dangerous. But I've heard of plastic surgeries being performed together to minimise healing time and costs, which could be an argument for it...

I'm going to a trade school, its remote so there's not a lot going on around us, just woods. There's a gym, and a rec Hall that honest to god looks and smells like a shitty bar (only has pool tables). I've been going here for a few months. I'm the only publicly out transgender kid on campus. This in turn directs a lot of... Hate, dis-content, homophobia, Transphobia, confusion, etc right on my shoulders. At first, I was okay with explaining it all. I shared my life, my struggles and pain with the people on this campus. I was warned that I was the first open Transgender student at this particular campus and that I would be treated equally. Okay. 


Its been months now. I've been called: Faggot, tranny, heshe, ""It"" in addition to the phrases:


""You're just a nigga""

""Do you have a pussy?""

""Do you have a dick?""

""You have a dick, stop lying""

""Your a heterosexual male""

""Your confused""

""Did you get the surgery?""

""when are you getting the surgery?""

""when are you getting your procedure done?""

""Did I just your feelings?""

""I call everyone Bro""

""I say dude to everyone""

""I'm not with that gay shit""

""I'm not gay, I don't like you like that""

I got into an intimate relationship. That was one big shit show. I got into an actual relationship, and I'm happy.

She sees me for who I really am and I genuinely love her. However the campus doesn't see it that way. I look a certain way (masculine, very male). However we're both considered Females in their records, thus we both live in the female dorms. I know what they think. I know what's written into my file. ""Student keeps entering student (B)'s room"" ughhh. Give me a break. Staff member hot with the: ""No PDA"", ""We don't need anymore (School name here) Babies"". We're not slow. Sigh*. What can I do? Go outside? Maybe a stroll around the campus only to be met with: ""Get a room""  (We had one, y'all took it away because y'all thought we were fucking). My favourite ""Aw look at the couples, the cute and the ugly"" 

Bitch please. You wish you has these cheekbones. And my girlfriend is thicc two C's. 


Other girls, hate em.

This is really hard for me to talk about. I just joined Reddit so I could get help. I'm not well.

Dr. Rumer butchered me and dealing with her office to get a resolution has been a fucking NIGHTMARE. I need help NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW. I'm not ok! I need help! Please help! Let me explain...

I'm a 35-yr old trans-woman. I had bottom surgery with Dr. Kathy Rumer in May 2017. Up until July 2018, Dr. Rumer told me how ""beautifully"" I was healing when I'd see her for a post-op check-up. That seems like her go-to word for every check-up: ""beautiful."" In July 2018, I had minor surgery right in her office to remove some granulation tissue. At that time, I also told her that I was bleeding almost every time I dilate for a month. She told me I needed surgery under ""twilight sedation"" to fix much deeper granulation tissue. She told me that it's very rare for someone to develop granulation tissue like this a year after bottom surgery. A few months later, she said she never said that. I couldn't have just pulled ""twilight sedation"" out of my ass. She told me something, and then said she didn't say it.

Her office is horrible at handling insurance. I waited and waited and waited on pre-authorization from insurance. Dr. Rumer's office doesn't make outbound calls to insurance providers. I had to have my health insurance company call her office. Whenever I deal with Dr. Rumer's office, I have to be the liaison for my insurance company and her office. It's horrible. They've had so many problems processing the correct procedures codes, dates, etc. You all don't know how many times I've had to call my insurance company and then start a 3-way conference call with Dr. Rumer's office.

I have literally emailed and called Dr. Rumer's office over 100 times. I've explained to them every moment my symptoms have gotten worse and worse.

I'm not a doctor by any means. Dr. Rumer told me originally that I needed surgery under twilight sedation, then she said she didn't say that, and then she later told me I needed major surgery under general anesthesia at Hahnnemen University Hospital (which I think actually closed now!). Last time I saw her, she said she wanted to take some of my belly fat for a skin graft in my vagina, and it would take another year to heal. She said it would be like starting from scratch again, as if it was the a brand new bottom-surgery. Oh joy. That's my layperson understanding of this.

It's hard to remember, but we were starting to discuss choosing a revision date right around the end of December 2018/early 2019. Then we were supposed to book for February or March, but her office simply couldn't figure out how to handle insurance, and THEN they put me on a wait list to have surgery on July 17, 2019. I kept insisting to them that I couldn't wait that long. I needed urgent help a year and a half ago. I meed much MORE urgent help now. It's September and I still haven't had revision surgery. I honestly lost a ton of weight from severe depression. About 2 weeks before I was supposed to have revision surgery, Dr. Rumer's associate (or family member?) Teri Rumer called me to cancel the surgery because I didn't weigh enough. I've gained much of that weight since then, but it's too fucking late now. I SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS WHEN THE DOCTOR ORIGINALLY TOLD ME OVER A YEAR AGO. It's been too long. 

Below are my current symptons. This is not going to be easy for me to write, and it's really personal and gross. So, sorry in advance.

At this point, I can BARELY dilate. My dilators have 5 dots on them to measure depth. Now I can only get half-way to the first dot on my smallest purple dilator. I used to be able to get to the 4th dot on the medium-size dilator, and the 3rd dot on the largest dilator. Currently, I barely have a fucking vagina. It's a joke. It's a baby-sized vagina/wound. I'm still bleeding. I'm getting gross green discharge. Sometimes it smells really bad and I'm extremely embarrased and hate myself. I'm becoming more depressed and asocial. Dr. Rumer's office literally told me to just do the best I can and iodine-douche every 2 days. It's completely pointless. I don't have a fucking vagina. I have a mystery wound hole.

I live right near Manhattan. I'm trying to set up an appointment to see Dr. Jess Ting. I need a new surgeon. I also quite possibly need a lawyer. **Any lawyers reading this??? My symptons and complaints are WELL-DOCUMENTED in all of my emails to Dr. Rumer's office**.

Dr. Rumer completely fucked up my body. I am completely unable to have sex, and it's driving me fucking crazy.

I'm sorry if this isn't the most well-written thing, or if there are gaps in my backstory. This has been an extremely traumatizing experience for me. I'm basically winging it and referring back to old notes as I type it, but I'm not exactly the most mentally sound at the moment.

I need help.

2019-09-04 01:08:30,czdudz,1,2,"I (m18) have been having thoughts lately about my gender. Sorry if my wording is weird I’ve never posted to reddit and I’m not a good writer, but I’m posting here on a secret account of mine cuz I don’t want people in my life knowing that I’m having thoughts like this. Sorry again if my wording is all over the place, I have a lot of thoughts and Im bad at describing my thoughts.

Growing up I’ve always been a tad feminine, but I’ve just blamed that on being gay (I’m still trying to figure my sexual orientation out). I don’t remember this but my mother says I would take her dresses and put them on and say, “i am a girl”. She was fine with it but my father didn’t approve. I do remember looking at my sister when she would wear ponytails and I would kinda be jealous of her being able to have long hair and being able to design it and change it up and accessorize which I wasn’t able to do because I had short boy hair. I always wanted to wear dresses and twirl around in them because the idea just felt freeing. 

I did stop having those thoughts for a while, and I began questioning my sexual orientation in middle school. I decided I was bi/gay. I also struggled a little bit with pronouns. Sometimes I only wanted he/him, other times I didn’t really care, and sometimes I didn’t really like he/him.
(At the moment I still really don’t care that much about my pronouns to me they are just words and if someone says the wrong pronouns I’m not gonna care)

I know I like men but I don’t know about women. I’ve had crushes on women but I don’t think I’d ever be in a relationship with a women. As a male I’m not interested in sexual relationships with women, but I would love the platonic parts of a relationship with a female. As a male i like men sexually and platonically. As a female I would like to be in a relationship with a man sexually and platonically. As a female I don’t think I would want a relationship with a female of any kind besides friendship. 

When I think of myself as a male it feels normal and right, but there are times when I think of myself as a women and it feels right as well (and I mean like a woman, I don’t wanna cross dress as a woman, if I were to wear woman clothes I would want to be a woman, and not the next day be a man again). When I think of myself as trans... I don’t necessarily like it. When I look at trans people (ftm, mtf) I hate myself for it but it doesn’t feel right. Everyone has their own right to express themselves the way they should be able to and if you want to be a different gender, go ahead I will support you no matter what and defend your right but there’s a little part of me that says it’s wrong and I am so sorry to everyone because I know that part of me if wrong but I can’t get rid of the feeling. Which is why I think that I can’t be trans, but is it me just trying to deny that part of me because growing up I was told I am a boy. And having everyone in my life know that I am changing to a women would just makes me feel,... wrong. I would feel like everyone is watching me and I just hate that feeling.

Sorry if my wording is weird I’ve never posted to reddit and I’m not a good writer, but I’m posting here on a secret account of mine cuz I don’t want people in my life knowing that I’m having thoughts like this. Sorry again if my wording is all over the place, I have a lot of thoughts and Im bad at describing my thoughts.\n\nGrowing up I’ve always been a tad feminine, but I’ve just blamed that on being gay (I’m still trying to figure my sexual orientation out). I don’t remember this but my mother says I would take her dresses and put them on and say, “i am a girl”. She was fine with it but my father didn’t approve. I do remember looking at my sister when she would wear ponytails and I would kinda be jealous of her being able to have long hair and being able to design it and change it up and accessorize which I wasn’t able to do because I had short boy hair. I always wanted to wear dresses and twirl around in them because the idea just felt freeing. \n\nI did stop having those thoughts for a while, and I began questioning my sexual orientation in middle school. I decided I was bi/gay. I also struggled a little bit with pronouns. Sometimes I only wanted he/him, other times I didn’t really care, and sometimes I didn’t really like he/him.\n(At the moment I still really don’t care that much about my pronouns to me they are just words and if someone says the wrong pronouns I’m not gonna care)\n\nI know I like men but I don’t know about women. I’ve had crushes on women but I don’t think I’d ever be in a relationship with a women. As a male I’m not interested in sexual relationships with women, but I would love the platonic parts of a relationship with a female. As a male i like men sexually and platonically. As a female I would like to be in a relationship with a man sexually and platonically. As a female I don’t think I would want a relationship with a female of any kind besides friendship. \n\nWhen I think of myself as a male it feels normal and right, but there are times when I think of myself as a women and it feels right as well (and I mean like a woman, I don’t wanna cross dress as a woman, if I were to wear woman clothes I would want to be a woman, and not the next day be a man again).

This person made a point to create a throwaway, stalk my posting history and decided to attempt to bully me over DM

There primary point was to ensure I knew I had a “manhood” and assured me that I would never be a woman

They also decided to look at my entire posting history and made these judgements. 

1) I fetishize lesbians (protip I am a lesbian and I like other lesbians)
2) I am a “lonely dude who jerks off to hentai” (I’ve posted in dating subreddits during some dark fucking episodes, and I like memes from anime subreddits)
3) I am a pedophile because I complimented a trans girls outfit, who were younger than me.

2019-09-05 21:14:28,d06ydv,2,1,"Hello. I had MtF bottom surgery 2 years ago in Pennsylvania. I live in New Jersey. I never healed from my surgery and I have been having SERIOUS complications for a year and a half. I informed my surgeon of my complications around June or July 2018, and now we're in September 2019! I have made over 140 emails and phone calls to my surgeon to get my issues resolved already. I need medical revision surgery, NOT cosmetic revision. I've been in pain, suffering, and bleeding continuously for a year and a half straight. I am utterly traumatized by my experience and my surgeon's nonchalant handling of this. Everything is very well-documented. I posted my full story in the AskTransgender subreddit. Please message me if you would like a link to my original post with further details. (I have to conform to the rules of this subreddit and not include personal details here.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Up until July 2018, my surgeon kept telling me how ""beautifully"" I was healing. Then it was a sudden HUGE problem without any resolution. My surgeon literally told me that I needed revision surgery and has done nothing about it. What type of doctor says ""You require surgery"" and then doesn't perform the surgery?? I feel ignored.  I am getting worse and worse as time goes on. In fact, I'm trying to set up consultations with other surgeons because I can't wait any longer. Her medical license needs to be taken away. I'm not the only victim of this surgeon. She needs to be stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

I identify as male, which means I don't know everything about being transgender and never will know how it feels to go through the struggles trans people deal with day-in and day-out. I've always treated trans people with respect, calling them by their preferred pronouns and name. I always want people to feel comfortable around me, so I've never even questioned it. 

My best friend, Josh, is transgender (FTM). Sometimes he educates me on what it's like to be trans and how he deals with it. But something crossed my mind a few weeks ago, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.

Masculinity doesn't mean you're a male, just like femininity doesn't mean you're female. I've always been a hyper, over-emotional, overdramatic boy growing up. I've heard all the names in the book, being told, ""you're acting like a girl,"" or, ""quit being a pussy."" Because of that, I've learned over the years that masculinity/femininity definitely doesn't determine your gender. And people who call you out for feeling, dressing, or acting a certain way are just douche-bags in general.

Something else I've been told is, your body parts don't determine your gender either. Knowing your gender comes from what you feel. But that's what confuses me.

*What is the feeling you get when finding out that you're male/female/other? If it's not masculinity/femininity, then what is that feeling?*

That's something I asked Josh a few nights ago on the phone. He genuinely didn't have an answer, other than, ""I've never thought about that before.""

I'm 25 now, and live in another country, and see my family maybe 2-3 times a year. I love them a lot. It would be humiliating to come out to them but I think my brother and sister and maybe my dad would eventually be okay with it.

I probably sound crazy for asking this, and maybe it's true that I should do the right thing for ME and not care about what my mom thinks at all... except I can't help it and I do really care about our relationship and it would be devastating to lose it.

2019-09-06 14:27:14,d0hdlj,2,3,"I just have to get this off my chest. I'll try to be brief.

First off, I'm years past transition; like 15 years. I have no idea if I register as trans on people's radar or not anymore. I never get misgendered, or stuff like that. I get treated like your average woman. No better or worse. I don't even think about it most of the time. 

I'm at the bar, sipping my drink and a tall grey haired guy ponies up to the bar next to me. We start chatting and I learn his name is Vance and is an artist showing his work at the gallery next door. He takes out his phone and starts to show me pics of his work. As he and I look through his pics, several text messages appear on his screen. One say ""hey have a good time with makenzi"" ( referring to me) and the second one says "" lol going from straight to gay"". 

Vance and I are reading this at the same time. It barely registers with him. He's intent on his artwork and talking me through it. I can't hear him anymore because I am really disturbed by the text messages.

The guy who sent them (his name is Peter) comes by to say goodnight, not knowing that I saw the messages. After these two say ""see ya"" to each other, I follow Peter to the door and ask him how he knows me, and he says we met at the bar a while back. I told him that I saw the message. I said it wasn't very nice. He just looked sheepish and left.

Here's the thing. I have no memory of meeting him at all, and I certainly never shared my history with him. I never share it with anyone, and I would never ever do so in a bar. So what the hell.

2019-09-06 17:50:22,d0k105,1,9,"Dear \[REDACTED\],

I'm writing this ten years after I came out. I didn't even think that was possible. Some nights I didn't even think I'd make it through the night. I thought I'd just write to let you know that so far it's turned out okay. I'm only 24, so this isn't the end, but I feel like I've reached a checkpoint &amp; wanted to check in. This isn't an 'it gets better' letter because I always found that shit to be braggy and condescending when I was you. It doesn't just magically get better of its own accord. It gets better 'cuz you bust your ass to make it better. You work on your mental health, you find &amp; talk to therapists (real ones, not the creepy conversion therapist your mom tries to send you to). You save money and stand up for yourself and make space for yourself to blossom into the grown-ass badass being you wanted to be. You meet boys and learn to have sex on your own terms and sometimes it's kind of bad and sometimes it's so, so good.

Oh, boys. If I remember anything about what it was like to be 13 it's that I was just floating in a bubble in the sea of my desire. You're not some sicko fetishist yaoi fangirl because you read yaoi and fanfiction nonstop. It might take you a while to realize it, but you're a gay dude, and these stories written by teenage girls about Sasuke and Naruto fucking are just the only representations you have right now of what your sexuality might look like. You're gonna write some fanfiction. It's gonna be fucking cringey. Teenagers figuring out their sexuality always kind of are. Then you're gonna try to meet real boys. Now I don't plan to fill this letter with advice cuz you already know this but for fuck's sake be careful. A lot of men see a teenage baby trans boi and they think they're an opportunity to mold a girlfriend to suit them. They see a chance to 'fix' and subjugate a dykey girl that will become a more interesting wife than the average straight girl. Maybe they even see your transness as a lifeline to their own queerness that they've already suppressed. Regardless, you're no one's lifeline, and creeps like that will always drag you down. Try to stay away from them.

Of course, all of this might be easier if you like girls. It certainly would have helped me--would have helped my parents understand, would have helped me find partners, would have helped me realize I was trans and not just some kind of gay porn fetishist.

Eventually things change though. You stand up for yourself, and you keep doing it. The whole world bears down on you and you feel like you can't keep going and you hit rock bottom and then months later you wake up and there's still sunshine and birds and clouds out there and you think hey, fuck it, if I'm still here I might as well have a life worth living.

You move to Canada, you move to New York. You change your name. You finish school. You don't get top surgery but you get a breast reduction you feel weirdly about. It helps, but it's not enough. Your mom paid for it thinking it would rid you of your dysphoria and this 'phase.' You told her for years it wouldn't but eventually you decided to try anyway. It didn't. It still helped though, somewhat.

Your body is yours now. To prove it to yourself you recently got a tattoo. As the tattooer--the only woman of color you could find in rural upstate New York--carves the shaded lines into your shoulder, a sense of ownership finally blossoms in your chest. Hopefully you'll get top surgery soon, maybe even a hysterectomy one day. Either way it's up to you now and no one else. Finally you control the fate of your body.

I guess this is the point where I should mention that you get married. That probably scares you. It sure as fuck scared me. I spent my whole childhood dealing with the repercussions of my parents' divorce, watching my mom enter disaster marriage after disaster marriage. I swore that would never happen to me. I told myself that all the aunties who said ""*3o2balek*""\* at weddings and all the grandmas pressuring me were wrong. I wouldn't be married. I couldn't be tied down. And yet here I am, two weeks married.

Looking back I didn't realize how much I needed a stable queer relationship to grow into my masculinity. As a gay non-op trans dude, it often feels like your gender and your sexuality are at odds. Most straight dudes are alienated by your whole butch aesthetic, and you really really don't wanna date straight dudes anyway. Most gay dudes are alienated by your tits, and even though that feels like an injustice, there's nothing anyone can do about it. Sometimes you cover up your body to have sex, insist on only doing it with your shirt (and a binder) on. Sometimes you bare your body in ways that make you feel uncomfortable because you're so fucking horny and desperate for human contact. People will try to take advantage of that. Eventually if you're lucky you'll meet someone just as queer and strange as you are. Someone who will hold space so that the person you're blooming into can grow and flourish. Someone who loves you no matter what--long hair or none, tits or no tits.

Of course, love like that doesn't just fall out of the sky. You have to take care of yourself first. Work on your mental health, come up with your own personal style. It's only when you begin living as your true self that you attract people who are into the real you--shocking, right? But don't take this as a suggestion that you obsess over passing. I think a lot of trans people would be happier if we realized we have less control over that than we'd like to think. Maybe we don't have the money to transition, maybe we're too tall. Worrying about your height or your head size or whether your binder flattens you completely is just useless anxiety. Focus on presenting yourself in the way that feels most comfortable in the body you have. Of course, that doesn't mean you can't wear a binder if you want to. I just realized I didn't, and that I would have been way happier if I'd known from the start that wanting to be able to breathe and run and not feel my chest crushing my ribcage didn't make me less of a man. Plus, let's face it, even after breast reduction my chest is too big to bind flat. These boy titties can't be contained.

The good thing is some people will see you no matter what you look like. Despite what the last couple hundred years of Judeo-Christian-Islamic hegemony would make you think, trans people have always existed and people know that. You will have cis dude friends who see you as their brother and are willing to fight on your side. You will have girl friends who hold you up and make you feel strong--though take care not to replicate cis dudes' mistake of over-relying on girls' generosity and support. This is not a journey into the same masculinity cis dudes fucked up the world with. This is a journey out of gender altogether, and you and all our trans and enby siblings are its leaders.

I'm sure before I close this out you want to hear about the sex, though. You were always a horny little egg. Just know that gay sex isn't like the fanfiction would make you think--it's better. Fanfiction is a representation of teenagers' yearning, inexperienced sexuality and its tropes don't represent what it feels like when two boys make love. The reality is so much fuller and deeper and sweatier and scarier. Queer love takes two bodies that the world treats as alien and forges them together and purifies them into their truest essence. Queer love is something wholly of you and your lovers' making. Queer love is self-expression and self-annihilation. Also, queer love requires more attention to your rectal health than fanfiction prepares you for. Invest in a bidet.

Anyway, this letter is four pages long now and I'm sure it doesn't make any sense. I guess if I have any last wisdom to impart, it's this: you are going to grow into the person you were meant to be. It might happen soon or it might be years from now. It's a process that's both inexorable and requires a lot of hard work to get through. You can do it. After all, somehow my messy gay ass did it.

Love,

Aaron

The whole world bears down on you and you feel like you can\'t keep going and you hit rock bottom and then months later you wake up and there\'s still sunshine and birds and clouds out there and you think hey, fuck it, if I\'m still here I might as well have a life worth living.\n\nYou move to Canada, you move to New York. You change your name. You finish school. You don\'t get top surgery but you get a breast reduction you feel weirdly about. It helps, but it\'s not enough. Your mom paid for it thinking it would rid you of your dysphoria and this \'phase.\' You told her for years it wouldn\'t but eventually you decided to try anyway. It didn\'t. It still helped though, somewhat.\n\nYour body is yours now. To prove it to yourself you recently got a tattoo. As the tattooer--the only woman of color you could find in rural upstate New York--carves the shaded lines into your shoulder, a sense of ownership finally blossoms in your chest. Hopefully you\'ll get top surgery soon, maybe even a hysterectomy one day. Either way it\'s up to you now and no one else. Finally you control the fate of your body.\n\nI guess this is the point where I should mention that you get married. That probably scares you. It sure as fuck scared me. I spent my whole childhood dealing with the repercussions of my parents\' divorce, watching my mom enter disaster marriage after disaster marriage. I swore that would never happen to me. I told myself that all the aunties who said ""*3o2balek*""\\* at weddings and all the grandmas pressuring me were wrong. I wouldn\'t be married. I couldn\'t be tied down. And yet here I am, two weeks married.\n\nLooking back I didn\'t realize how much I needed a stable queer relationship to grow into my masculinity. As a gay non-op trans dude, it often feels like your gender and your sexuality are at odds. Most straight dudes are alienated by your whole butch aesthetic, and you really really don\'t wanna date straight dudes anyway. Most gay dudes are alienated by your tits, and even though that feels like an injustice, there\'s nothing anyone can do about it. Sometimes you cover up your body to have sex, insist on only doing it with your shirt (and a binder) on. Sometimes you bare your body in ways that make you feel uncomfortable because you\'re so fucking horny and desperate for human contact. People will try to take advantage of that. Eventually if you\'re lucky you\'ll meet someone just as queer and strange as you are. Someone who will hold space so that the person you\'re blooming into can grow and flourish. Someone who loves you no matter what--long hair or none, tits or no tits.\n\nOf course, love like that doesn\'t just fall out of the sky. You have to take care of yourself first. Work on your mental health, come up with your own personal style. It\'s only when you begin living as your true self that you attract people who are into the real you--shocking, right? But don\'t take this as a suggestion that you obsess over passing. I think a lot of trans people would be happier if we realized we have less control over that than we\'d like to think. Maybe we don\'t have the money to transition, maybe we\'re too tall. Worrying about your height or your head size or whether your binder flattens you completely is just useless anxiety. Focus on presenting yourself in the way that feels most comfortable in the body you have. Of course, that doesn\'t mean you can\'t wear a binder if you want to. I just realized I didn\'t, and that I would have been way happier if I\'d known from the start that wanting to be able to breathe and run and not feel my chest crushing my ribcage didn\'t make me less of a man. Plus, let\'s face it, even after breast reduction my chest is too big to bind flat. These boy titties can\'t be contained.\n\nThe good thing is some people will see you no matter what you look like. Despite what the last couple hundred years of Judeo-Christian-Islamic hegemony would make you think, trans people have always existed and people know that. You will have cis dude friends who see you as their brother and are willing to fight on your side. You will have girl friends who hold you up and make you feel strong--though take care not to replicate cis dudes\' mistake of over-relying on girls\' generosity and support. This is not a journey into the same masculinity cis dudes fucked up the world with. This is a journey out of gender altogether, and you and all our trans and enby siblings are its leaders.\n\nI\'m sure before I close this out you want to hear about the sex, though. You were always a horny little egg. Just know that gay sex isn\'t like the fanfiction would make you think--it\'s better. Fanfiction is a representation of teenagers\' yearning, inexperienced sexuality and its tropes don\'t represent what it feels like when two boys make love. The reality is so much fuller and deeper and sweatier and scarier. Queer love takes two bodies that the world treats as alien and forges them together and purifies them into their truest essence. Queer love is something wholly of you and your lovers\' making. Queer love is self-expression and self-annihilation. Also, queer love requires more attention to your rectal health than fanfiction prepares you for. Invest in a bidet.\n\nAnyway, this letter is four pages long now and I\'m sure it doesn\'t make any sense. I guess if I have any last wisdom to impart, it\'s this: you are going to grow into the person you were meant to be. It might happen soon or it might be years from now. It\'s a process that\'s both inexorable and requires a lot of hard work to get through. You can do it. After all, somehow my messy gay ass did it.\n\nLove,\n\nAaron\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*an Egyptian Arabic word that is said to every \'girl\' in Egypt over the age of 6 at weddings.

I originally saw the results of phallo and liked the size and everything but what troubles me the most is the circumcised look, which probably doesn't make sense to a lot of you but I come from a place where it's not common, and I'd feel personally more comfortable with a foreskin.

Another thing is I don't like the appearance of the skin graft for phallo and I'm concerned that the scar of the skin graft would cause me more dysphoria.

2019-09-07 00:02:35,d0otm4,5,3,"Couldn't really think of where else I could go to ask, so I'm going here. I'm going to take every answer with a grain of salt, but I will listen and consider any response. I'm trying to figure out if I'm mtf trans or just kinda psychologically deformed by sexuality... Long post ahead.....

So I've researched the topic, and I didn't necessarily grow up feeling like I belonged more with girls or preferring ""girl activities"". I grew up with only brothers, so that's just what I knew. I also didn't realize I was mixed race until I started going to public school (late elementary). I was never internally opposed to princesses and the like, but I acted like I abhorred that stuff for the sake of fitting in with the other boys. 

It was mostly shame that made me deny idea of wanting to be a girl internally. It was shameful to be a girl, or in any way effeminate. Perhaps that's fed into fetishes/kinks rather than true gender dysphoria.

I knew I was into pregnancy way before I even knew about sex. I can't remember how I reacted when I heard only women could get pregnant, but I do remember being skeptical for a bit. I think part of it was wanting to be pregnant myself, but I'm not sure.

Not too long after, I found out about the concept of being trans through some documentary or something. For some reason, my brothers and I all watched all the way through it. I think there was a CSI episode on it too. I completely misunderstood it, and thought it was a way that, if I absolutely wanted to, I could get pregnant too (I remember a story about a man who transitioned, had kids, and then de-transitioned). It kinda stuck in my head as a sort of backup plan if I wanted to abandon everything in life and start anew.

When I hit puberty, I masturbated like a girl. Like, I'd ""tuck"" and then rub it like an over-the-pants handy and that's what got me off. It was around this time I discovered my autogynophelia. It was initially the fertility, but now it's just the shape of a woman in general. There had been times since then where I thought I might be more comfortable with my body with breasts and a vagina.

I'm not always this way, though. Often times, I look down to see my genitals and just see it as my genitals. It doesn't always look wrong, but there are times where I wish it were something else.

I'm sort of a skinny guy. Not necessarily androgynous in appearance, but somewhat in build. It mostly makes me look younger than I really am. After workouts, I feel less dysphoric, and look forward to building more muscle (until motivation fades).

When I first started having sex, it was the same way, though lately, it's been weird. Initially, I'd feel more manly because like, I'm dickin this girl and stuff. But then when I'd be single and masturbate, I'd remember what a their vaginas felt like and imagine that on myself. Lately (after a multi-year dry spell) , with the woman I'm sleeping with now, I had some difficulty orgasming. I'd done it regularly a couple times, but it wasn't frequent. Last time, though, I had what had probably been described as ""female"" orgasms. It was all the way throughout my body, it lasted longer, and while I was satisfied, I was still able to keep going.

This wasn't the first time having an orgasm like that. My last sexual partner managed to get me to do that too, a couple times. I struggled to orgasm with her because of condoms, but this girl I'm with now's infertile and clean (I believe her because it's the best smelling vag I've ever eaten out, which, granted, is not a lot).

I don't talk to anybody about this. I have a lot of religious friends and some very conservative family members. But you could probably tell by the pile of word vomit here.

*I don't think I want to transition though, because here's why*:
1. The discomfort I'll feel with my body has not made me suicidal or depressed.
2. I'm in America and our healthcare is stupid.
3. I'm jealous of lesbians' sex lives, but I'm not jealous of their difficulty finding partners or how often they have to deal with unwanted sexual advances from creepy dudes (I already get that as a dude).
4. I don't know if I'd ever feel complete as a female with our current technology. I could never get pregnant. I'd struggle with my voice and my bone structure and a bunch of other stuff that, as far as I can tell, are not easy if not impossible to change. Also, TG fiction has set the bar too high for me...
5. I've seen myself in those gender-change filters and am still don't feel like I look right through their female filters, I doubt I can do much better for myself.

A cis friend of mine messaged me a few days to ask if erotic interest in cross-dressing and gender play is problematic/offensive for trans people. 

Obviously trans people are sexualized and fetishized all the time, but I'm curious if some manifestations of sexualized cross-dressing might not be problematic or offensive?

I've been thinking of my answer and so far have come to the idea that, to varying degrees, it all is because it is dependent on a history steeped in gender essentialization and strict categorization, where the erotic interest comes to some extent from taboo of breaking that. I'm not fully convinced of that though.

I think there's some space for finding genderbending attractive, but as a mostly non-sexual person, I really can't speak on the sexual aspect. Like of one of my partners who is a man wore a crop top and a skirt, I'd find that extremely attractive but more as a product of being interesting and seeing him in something new and flattering.

15yr old MtF here, 4mo hrt. I’ve been struggling with my identity for some time, maybe not as much as others, but to me it’s been a long ride. I have a difficult time calling myself a woman, even though most people I’ve asked say I pass fairly well. I have serious trouble with thoughts of never being a “real woman” and I think that has to do with internalized transphobia. I know I’ll never be cis, and it just hurts knowing that. I’ll always be “that trans girl” or “the shemale.” However, I consider myself VERY privileged when it comes to the age that I started hrt and being able to pass somewhat decently. The only thing that really throws people off is my voice, and my inflection. I try very hard to make my voice sound feminine but most of the time, I either get clocked instantly or the bass in my voice just slowly slips out while I’m talking. A lot of the time I’m just sitting there wishing I was comfortable with being a boy, or wishing I was born female. Unfortunately, dysphoria has also dictated my sexuality, I feel like I’m bi, but I only want to date men because dating women just makes me incredibly dysphoric. I’ve genuinely felt love for women but it was quickly shut down by my dysphoria. I genuinely would not wish gender dysphoria on my worst enemy, this is absolutely fucking awful. Cis people have no idea how lucky they are. However, I do think being trans has some positives, I would have never met so many great people had I not been trans. Also, a bit off-topic, but I produce music and make beats, and my emotions have leaked into a lot of my songs. And in most cases I believe have made those songs better. I mostly make lo-fi hip-hop, and most of the music in that genre is usually very gloomy/sad. Making this type of music helps me find an escape from the constant burden of dysphoria and really helps me express myself. However, (again) there are still those main points I mentioned earlier, which still affect me greatly, and I would really appreciate any advice that you all might have.

And I don't want to make this about porn or anything of the sort.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just really curious about one thing, and that is... well. After I starter on androcur, I just can't orgasm any more. I do understand how the production of ejaculate is HEAVILY reliant on testosterone, and I am glad to get ""evidence"" that something is working and going in the right way. My issue, however is mainly that... well, I do not have penis dysphoria. I have no intention of going through needless surgery to get rid of something I have no problem with.

However, the situation where I can neither get dry orgasms nor ejaculate more than a few droplets is quite stressful. Because it sort of requires me to relearn the way I think about sex, and I'm sure I'll be forced to think completely different about enjoyment. 

But before I just accept this as something I've had, but won't have anymore. I want to ask you people, is there ""a way""? Is ejaculating and orgasms a thing of the past, and there's no going back. Or are there actually some things to do? I'm sort of assuming the porn stars are getting shots of testo or something... and that's not going to be an option for me. It's not what I want. But I'm sort of clinging to straws here.

I joined this group for help in communicating with a student. Please be respectful and honest. 

I am an elementary PE teacher (among many other hats I wear and have worn, including teaching in high school and coaching) and I recently had the pleasure and honor of meeting a young boy (formerly girl- I suppose one would say) whom I feel an extremely strong connection to. His first day in class I was unaware of his situation and inadvertently used the incorrect pronoun when describing a scenario to the class. It almost instantaneously occurred to me that I may have made this faux pas. I inquired about the “girl” with a colleague and she happened to know his story because his family is friends of hers. He decided this past summer that he was a boy. I worried quite a bit that night that I had hurt him and intended to apologize the next day. 
In a glorious turn of events, this amazing young boy asked his teacher if he could come talk with me. I assumed it was about the pronoun, but it was the fact that some other boys refused to see him as a boy. He wanted to talk to me more than his teacher (who apologized after our talk for addressing him as a her), the counselor, or anyone else in the school. I gave the best advice I could and felt it was very helpful. He even hugged me after. I read George, a story about a fourth grader in a similar situation, and want to do all I can for this great kid. His home life is a bit tense at the moment and I’ve already talked to his family friend and my wife so if something goes wrong I want them to know I am willing to adopt him. I feel very close to him. 
I have had several (mtf) students in classes when I taught high school, but this is my first experience with the (ftm) perspective. My question for the group is, what advice, steps, helpful things, or anything else can I do?

Thank you.

In an attempt at explaining the title I mean that I am truly happy that he and I have formed a bond and that he trusts me.

I am currently really struggling to understand the transsexual experience, and I thought who better to ask than those who live it everyday. Specifically, I don't really understand what individuals who identify this way feel like they are a certain gender.

This is probably due to my own experience as a cisgender (think that's the right term, let me know if I'm wrong) individual, but I don't feel like I am a man or woman, the only indication to me is when I look down, and go ""Oh ok, I'm that then"". Is it that the individual feels more feminine or masculine than their peers, or more feminine than they are masculine or vice versa? In which case is this not an issue with gender roles being confining, and the expectations of men and women?

For those who have not read any of my other posts I will be working in China until FEB 2022. 

(1) The big thing this week is that I have the house to myself for 10 days. I am currently wearing Katie's clothes (They have been away in suitcases for about 4 months). HRT has for sure changed my body a little. I have a little hour glass figure going on. I have obvious breast growth so the clothes are fitting better and my butt is really nice. 

(2)  Tried to get my hair cut today and the women cut it too short, really hard to communicate sometimes. It isn't too bad but I was devastated. I was hoping for a bob style. down to my lips. instead it is to my nose. (this happened with my eyebrows too. Went to get them trimmed&lt; but don't know how to say in Chinese I want to be pretty without giving myself away LOL)

(3) I don't even know how to pronunce the word  dysphoria, (meaning I have never heard it said) I just always knew I was a girl. 10 weeks into HRT, I have been worrying about certain aspects of my face. My nose is long, I have no idea about my chin, jaw and brow ridge. Wish I could post a photo on here.

(4) Face is changing very slightly. I get glimpses of her in the mirror, some days more than others. I have been working 7 days a week since July 8TH and I do look really tired. 

(5) breasts grew really fast, no nipples but they are sore and painful to touch. 

(6) Feel like I am shrinking too, but no solid evidence yet. although my shoes are for sure feel a little big now. let's wait on this one.

(7) Laser hair removal starts in 2 weeks today. face and neck, can't get my breasts out in a Chinese hospital so I will do my chest with a home laser. This hospital does lots of stuff so I might get my nose made smaller. 

(8) This one is fantastic. I am a Manager of 15 people and since HRT I have actually become better at dealing with people. I don't mess about and tell people directly unlike before. I am actually a lot better with people skills fair and firm ....pre HRT I was too nice LOL

2019-09-10 03:55:49,d22bk6,1,7,"Hi all,

My boyfriend is FTM, and we recently explored him topping (He loved it, and now I want more for him!). 

I was looking into strap-ons, but just couldn't get past the fact that he wouldn't really feel any PHYSICAL ""stimulation."" 
I eventually found this:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MZVCPXV/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_GVXDDbE2X1DF5

It's a great and comfortable design (flexible, soft), BUT it slips out of him easily (we just slipped the shaft through his boxers to keep it in place). 

Can anyone suggest toys similar to this? Maybe that feel better or are more comfortable to wear?

Sorry if I don't know much, I was very straight/cis before my boyfriend and I connected (to put it simply), and don't really know what options we have. 

PS: I figured we could use penis enlargement sleeves on the tip that goes inside him, but he's not very tall/deep. 
The point is for him to be comfortable and still feel stimulated, and I'm worried something too big might be unpleasant (or worse, take away from the experience of topping me.)

2019-09-10 15:01:43,d28qto,3,2,"Hi, I am a straight white woman and I need advice for my cousin who is transitioning. I was always close to him when he was younger and now I still want to be close. I am sorry if this is confusing. He decided to transition a few years ago. At that time I was going through a lot and really had not had the chance to spend any time with him. He has changed his name and I have reached out to show my love. 

I felt incredibly bad for her because she has not been treated the best and all I want is for her to be happy and loved. I was able to visit with her a few weeks ago and it made my heart so happy. It was great seeing her again. But more than anything the smile on her face just made me smile. I even commented that I was so happy to see how happy she is and smiling like that. She was surprised because I guess not many people say that. She does not have much or any support from family. 

So here are my questions. What can I do to reconnect to her and is it ok to compliment her on things, or does that make it awkward? I wanted to tell her how lovely her voice sounded and how great her hair looks long. But I was not sure if that would build her up or make it seem awkward? I also want to see if she wants to go shopping and have a girls day, kind of make her feel special. See if she wants to do makeup, or we can get clothes, or nails done, basically girly stuff she may not have a chance to do too often. But I don't know if that is too much and if it takes time to get to that point. I think it may be a slow but steady process for her and she is a bit shy. But I also want to help if she would like it also. 

Basically I want her to feel loved, accepted, and happy and support her on her new journey. So anything I can do to help with that would be great. Any advice, ideas or tips will be much appreciated. Things that I should avoid, topics, or things that would have been nice to hear, that y'all would have appreciated would be great to know. We also live in the south but in a big city that is accepting of everyone if that's good to know. She is also a bit shy so I want her to be comfortable no matter what.

And since the mtf sub thought it was erotica... 

Its now been 3 months since my surgery and according to my doctor, i can finally have fun with my new vagina! On my booklet that they gave me to schedule my dilatations for the year and other post-op care information, it said : ""you will need lubrication for vaginal sex""

Ha!

As the day drew ever closer to the 3 month mark, so has the date at which i start going back to work. But even better, so has the date of my wife's birthday. And I have been teasing her for weeks about it. My wife is also trans, but has opted to keep her lovely apparatus intact seeing as she likes it the way it is and is not dysphoric about it as well.

But there is also the fact that prior to me, she was a gay guy and has never been with a woman before. I was going to be her first. Quite the shoes to fill but I was up to the challenge.

I woke up early, thinking I could get my first dilation of the day done ahead of time but something kept me from actually doing it. As I picked up my phone and started browsing Reddit (of course), some very exciting pictures came along in my feed which aroused my body to the point of no return.

I turned to my still sleeping wife and put my arms around her, and my hand in her hair. As I gently woke her up by massaging her hair, i took my other hand and started gently scratching her with my nails, all over her thigh and all the way to her nipple.

I sensed her shifting and grunting more and more as i wrapped her arm around me so I could get even closer to her. I nibbled her tit.

She loves that.

My hands start moving around more and she finally shifts on to her back, allowing me full access. I wrap one leg around hers and move my hand down some more. Our eyes finally meet.

""Good morning"" i said as i squeezed gently.

""hrmmmph.. 'rning"" as her eyes lit up slightly more.

I continued my morning greeting with more fervor until she could take no more and gasped for air.

""Is there coffee?"" she asked as i laid by her side.

""Not yet, I'll go make it... later"" as I grinned to her face. She grinned back.

She turns to her side and opens up the nightstand. Out comes the magic wand and i lay on my back. Despite my best effort, orgasms have been anything but easy for me since that faithful day in June. My wife bought the wand for herself (with attachment) but I wanted to try it out and see if I could get some amount of pleasure out of it.

As she turns towards me, she lays her head on my breast gently and puts the wand on my crotch.

I shutter as she turns it on. She then proceeds to move it around, but I am still too swollen for the wand to work on the surface. I put my hand on hers and start to guide her around as best I can, hoping for a sensation on my end. I eventually find the sensation to be pretty nice on its own and just enjoy the moment. At one point, I had enough.

it was time.

""I want you"" i blurbed out. I knew she understood me as the wand twitched as I said it. So I said It again. She then turns to me and looks at me with intrigue.

The wand is turned off and she nervously but mischievously scoots in front of me and as I spread my legs.

""Are you sure?""

I nodded.

she fumbles around my crotch area, unsure of herself but I can't blame her, I've basically got a personal flotation device instead of a decent woman's vulva.

She tries her best but suggests that i mount her instead. I obliged. We switch positions and ask her if she's ready to beleive me.

""Beleive what?"" she asks me inquisitely.

""That I was telling you the truth about how it feels to be inside a woman.""

She kisses me on the lips.

""Let's find out!""

Sadly, with little feeling around my new vagina, i struggle to put her apparatus inside of me... until I don't.

Her face lit up like I have never seen it before. She shares with me a look that resembles a mix of excitement and pain and a dozen other emotions.

I feel nothing, but I feel everything. I sense her excitement has she grabs my hips and starts to buck hers upward. If only for a moment until she collapses and covers her face in shame.

""What's wrong?""

""I'm so ashamed, i came so fast, you'd think that I bought that wand in order to help me last longer...""

I removed her hands from her face and look her straight in the eyes.

""It's your first time with a woman. And i did kinda worked you up a lot before. Plus, you think that i lasted long my first time??""

She put her hands back on her face, visibly distraught.

""This is a first for both of us. We'll both have to learn each other again.""

She nods, still with both her hands between us, and sighs.

I wiggle my butt on her crotch.

""Do you want try again?""

""I dunno, do you think so?"" she replies as I sense something hard once more.

I once again help her with the alignment but now, things are different. She's in control.

I raise myself up straight, she moans even more. I can feel her bucking more and more and her hand on my hips and waist.

She's really in control now.

So I let go.

For the first time in my life, I'm someone else's to do what they please.

it feels good to let go.

It feels good to have her in me, even if I don't feel anything. The knowledge that this is happening to me is euphoric.

My Mexican roots are so conservative and tied with Catholicism so my family didn't take it well. They shunned me out and I was on my own at 19. I struggled finding jobs/housing/school, it's genuinely been the toughest 4 years of my life. Today, I find myself happier; some days are tough but being able to live my truth out weighs any pain i've experienced over the years. I may not have the most support in my life, but i've learned to support myself. I've learned to love myself. Being on the other side, I wish I could tell my younger self that they will be okay. It was fucking terrifying, but now i'm able to be free. I'm able to be me.

I know there are so many other trans individuals who are going through similar situations. I was able to feel so confident and progress in my journey because of other people's stories. I want to be that person for someone else. I started a podcast that's all about my transition/topics that relate to transitioning. I really try to provide as much advice as I can because it's been such a tough journey for me and I know someone could benefit off the things I have to say.

2019-09-12 04:55:58,d32z92,3,1,"Hi, throwaway for obvious reasons. I also use this account to ask general dumb questions in r/Advice, sorry if this isn't the right place and sorry it's so long.

My (21F) younger sibling (19MTF - we've discussed pronouns already, he's not ready for she/her) came to me a few months ago and told me he was trans. I've done my best to be as supportive as possible. I have a few questions about being transgender, but don't want to ask him because I don't want to scare him away. I truly care about him and want him to feel good in his own skin. Please tell me if I sound like an asshole!!

1. It's already pretty established that traditional gender roles are going away. Girls can wear suits, boys can wear dresses, etc. What does it really mean to be trans then? I poked through this sub and found advice such as ""wear nail polish and makeup"", but those aren't really ""female"" things anymore. Is it because it helps you feel more traditionally female? Sorry if it sounds bigoted or asshole-y, I genuinely want to understand and could use a trans person's perspective.

2. Maybe this is more of a mental health issue, but my brother does not want to take part in any aspect of life without transitioning first, but also refuses to take the first step in transitioning. He doesn't have an ID, won't get a job, and won't go to school. In our area there aren't really options to get hormones or anything, but I've researched therapists and counselors for him and he won't initiate any kind of treatment. His reasoning is that our mother won't make him an appointment. We've discussed that he is the one who ultimately has to start and he is an adult, but he just won't do anything. As someone who has struggled with depression in the past, it really really hurts to watch him throw his life away over something as small as an M on his ID. What can I do that I haven't already tried?

3. Almost went to AITA for this one. Our mother's bathroom door has to stay closed because the dog gets in the trash. Today he left the door open and the dog tore up all of her used pads. Our mom is disabled and can't bend over or stand too long without getting out of breath, so I cleaned it up. My brother asked me why she has a trash can in her bathroom, and I said ""Um, women are a thing."" He just wasn't understanding that women menstruate. I thought about his desktop wallpaper of half-naked anime girls and all the female characters he likes because they're designed well, and for a second I doubted how he felt. How can you say you are a woman when you don't even understand that periods exist? If being a woman meant being a cute anime girl, anyone would choose to be a woman. I feel so incredibly terrible now of course, but were my thoughts that asshole-y in the first place? I could really just use someone to help me process and correct them I guess.

2019-09-12 05:05:21,d332j2,4,3,"Hello, I'm currently in a gray zone about my identity. I've had dysphoric thoughts disappear for a roughly a year, but the thoughts are back.

This is related because I haven't changed my body at all. I've tried before. I was able to get on hormones for a month. But it didn't really change anything before I was forced off.

Anyway, what I'm saying is that since my thoughts are back now, I'm thinking about how to approach this, if they stay. (Last time they were here for 3-4ish years.). I have two large hurdles:

1. My weight. I'm not fat or overweight. I'm a lil' chubby and just unfit. I just don't like it. (Plus I know sometimes people gain some weight from hormones, so I want to be prepared.) But I have many friends knowledgeable on the subject to help on that.

2. My body hair. As I am, I'm a *bear*. Nearly every part of me is covered in thick black hair. And I want it gone.

How do I approach this? Shaving takes too long and the upkeep would be ridiculous because of how fast it grows. And I really don't have money for laser or electrolysis, nor to go out and get waxed. (I waxed myself once for Halloween. Ended up being 3.5 jars of wax and 200 dollars)

School is the one place where people I'm out to can fully address me by my name and correct pronouns because I'm not out to everyone in my family yet. Everyone is respectful and trying their best to address me properly even if it's harder to some then others, at least they're trying.

He lovingly expressed disappointment in hearing that because ""I'm such a pretty girl."" Which made me feel awful but I figured it can't get worse then that. However, it went downhill from there when I told him to address me as Florian, which is a name I had already been using online for 3+ years. I was comfortable with it and I can respond to it very easily and quickly. He, however, told me he hated my name and said that until I got a name he approved of he'd just keep calling me my deadname. I did my best to convince him otherwise to no avail until I just caved and let him call me by a special nickname that wasn't my name but it was at least masculine.                                                                However, the final straw was a night ago where I missed his call because I was playing DnD and he sent me messages saying that if I didn't answer then he'd tell me I'd never be a real man. This HURT me and it took me a minute to respond to him about how horrible that is. He responded saying he knows and that he was sorry because he felt bad the moment he typed it but it took me calling him out on it for him to applogise. He's the type to joke around a lot but I'm not comfortable knowing that he even thought that telling me what my brain has been telling me for the past 6 months was a good idea. Even if he was joking. All around I still love and value his friendship because he's such a good friend but when he rarely crosses lines he polevaults himself over them and it leave me feeling horrible.

Then there\'s one of my friends who was at first super nice when I told him I was trans and I thought that since he\'s gay and therefore LGBT he\'d be a ready to address me right.                                                                                                                       He lovingly expressed disappointment in hearing that because ""I\'m such a pretty girl."" Which made me feel awful but I figured it can\'t get worse then that. However, it went downhill from there when I told him to address me as Florian, which is a name I had already been using online for 3+ years. I was comfortable with it and I can respond to it very easily and quickly. He, however, told me he hated my name and said that until I got a name he approved of he\'d just keep calling me my deadname. I did my best to convince him otherwise to no avail until I just caved and let him call me by a special nickname that wasn\'t my name but it was at least masculine.                                                                However, the final straw was a night ago where I missed his call because I was playing DnD and he sent me messages saying that if I didn\'t answer then he\'d tell me I\'d never be a real man. This HURT me and it took me a minute to respond to him about how horrible that is. He responded saying he knows and that he was sorry because he felt bad the moment he typed it but it took me calling him out on it for him to applogise. He\'s the type to joke around a lot but I\'m not comfortable knowing that he even thought that telling me what my brain has been telling me for the past 6 months was a good idea. Even if he was joking. All around I still love and value his friendship because he\'s such a good friend but when he rarely crosses lines he polevaults himself over them and it leave me feeling horrible. I want to tell him but I\'m worried that I\'ll come off wrong and I\'m the type of person that wants to avoid conflict at all costs.

I’m 15 ftm. My mom has always been super supportive of the LGBTQ+ community so I’m not particularly worried about being hurt or anything like that. 

The main reason I am hesitant to tell her is I have three younger brothers and no sisters. My mom made this deal with my dad before we were all born where she would get to name the girls and he would name the boys. Obviously she got the short end of the stick there, but she was always perfectly happy about it and loves to call me her “favorite daughter” as a joke. I am worried that it would hurt her feelings if I told her that I had decided I was actually a boy. 

Overall if I didn’t tell her I don’t think it would matter to things all that much. I don’t experience gender dysphoria about the pronouns I am called so my mom referring to me by she/her pronouns doesn’t bother me that much. I have a binder that I wear a lot but she hasn’t noticed it at all. The only thing it might matter for is when I want to take t, but at this point I think I can wait till I’m out of the house (and more sure of my decision) before I do that too.

I saw a post a bit ago about someone getting their mothers dresser, and most of the comments mention how everyone remembers going into their moms dresser and trying on her clothes. 

It really made me think about how many of us did the same things, not even realizing the significance of it at the time. 

I remember being 6 and going into my mom's dresser, she sent me into her room to take a nap. I took that time to get fully dressed in her clothes, down to panties and pantyhose. 

Around 8 I started stealing some of my sister's clothes, mainly thongs. Somehow, they made me feel more human than the underwear I had. Plus, I loved the colors. 

After I hit puberty, I kept wearing thongs, but played into the hiphop style of the early 2000's. I normalized wearing panties in my mind, ""everyone does it"" so I never really thought about it. I loved/love shoes, but many of the ones I wanted were women's. I had a connection of shoes that neared 100 pairs.

My name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

**If you are interested, please visit** [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. 

If you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M. Paz Galupo (she/her or they/them), at [pgalupo@towson.edu](mailto:pgalupo@towson.edu) 

**Transgender Research Informed Consent (TRICON) Disclosure Policy:**

**Objective:** The objective is to gain a better understanding of how gender expectations, gender dysphoria, and body satisfaction may or may not interact to impact levels of sexual satisfaction. The results of this study will help to inform clinicians who work with transgender and non-binary clients to improve their sexual satisfaction.

**Primary Investigator:** The co-PI’s are Louis Lindley (graduate student at Towson University) and Annalisa Anzani (Doctoral Student at University of Milano – Bicocca) who are being supervised by Dr. M. Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)

**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. 

**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.

**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.

**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English.

We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. \n\n**If you are interested, please visit** [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)\n\nParticipation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. \n\nIf you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M.

Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)\n\n**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. \n\n**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.\n\n**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.\n\n**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English. \n\n**Compensation:** There is no cost to participant in the study nor are there any travel requirements.

I have a student that recently identified himself to the staff (one on one) as trans. We are a very liberal, supportive school with like 99% of the staff being supportive of trans folks. He is in 7th grade and when he told me, he just said (before rollcall) that he had a preferred name (i won’t mention it but the equivalent is charlotte to Charles if that makes sense).
I’m obviously in full support of him, and one thing we do as teachers is print the school district policy on trans identification which tells the students their rights in regards to pronouns, bathroom use, etc.
My reason for posting though is to see if there is anything i May miss that maybe you experienced in middle school? What are some things that you wish your teachers would have done for you, or anything like that.
I’m a cismale gym teacher. We don’t have changing rooms or anything so that’s not an issue for us.  But if there’s anything you think i should or should not be doing, please let me know. I’d like to make his transition as comfortable as possible while he’s in my class.None of the games or activities i do in gym divide students up by gender or anything like that, i never have “boys vs girls” etc.

2019-09-15 02:03:52,d4egt4,0,2,"Hi Reddit,

I am FtM and I just turned 16. After reviewing my transcript with my counselor, I discovered that I am ahead on credits and can graduate this year! Yay! I've been really excited about college for a long time, mostly because I'm so excited to focus on studying what I really love, but also because I planned on being out in college. Right now, my situation at home isn't great. My father is very emotionally absent and doesn't seem to even know who I really am. He starts a fight or ignores me anytime I try to talk about my plans to graduate early, and my mom and I both think that he still sees me as an argumentative 4 y/o who gets into constant trouble, not a responsible 16 year old. I have tried multiple times to come out to my mom, who I have a much better relationship with, and every time as soon as I started talking, she told me that this wasn't something I could talk about and that I needed to be quiet. I know that if I try to come out to my father, he will think I am lying for attention, because he thinks the same thing every time I try to come to him about physical or mental issues. Both of my parents are baby boomers and still say the words gay and transgender with hushed voices like they're talking about someone who is dying. They have also spoken rudely about celebrities and distant family members who are LGBT. 

This brings me back to the college situation. Right now I am applying to Carthage College, University of Chicago, and possibly Cornell. I'm using the common app, and it asks your biological sex, then has a section where you can elaborate on gender identity. I originally wrote Transgender Male there, at the recommendation of some teachers I am out to. I deleted it, though, after my mom told me she wanted to come visit me often at college, such as on parents weekends, and after she offhandedly reminded me that her and my father were planning to pay my college tuition. My father is extremely strict, and has already said that he will not pay my tuition if I get any tattoos or piercings, and I know that if I come out and start to transition, he will stop paying. I also know that if I am out at college and am able to be in a male dorm/floor with a male roommate, my parents will notice when they move me in and come visit.

I don't know what to do, and I've been really worried about it. I will still be a minor my first year of college, and that means I have to abide by my parents' rules. I also know that staying in my high school will be really bad for me. I don't have any friends there and am having a lot of trouble socially. I also won't have any classes to take next year. I also know that if I go to college and stay in the closet, I'll be depressed and badly dysphoric, and I don't want that ruining this experience.

I'd like your guys's advice on what to do, and to hear what those of you in similar situations have done. Also if any of you are students at the colleges I've listed, I'd love to hear what it's like to be transgender there, especially for Carthage since I haven't find any information about their trans community other than that it exists.

I am now 38...  same dose...  I enjoy the morning wood...  but I get a rush for a week...  im meh for a week after.. and then i fizzle....   \n\n\nBUT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast inject, I went fatty tissue....  I pussied out...  I am at week 4... I didnt crash, still horney, still 'me' and frankly not bad...  \n\n\nIma do another fatty injection.  in 2 weeks Ill do my blood test...

Was just reading an article. It was about Trans lesbians and the difficulties they go through. It was written about a month ago. And all of the comments on the post labelled it as anti lesbian rhetoric. And said that we are just predators fetishising lesbians. One stated that apparently science has proven that it is impossible for a trans woman person to be in love with a woman. I first came out of the closet when I was 17. I went back in when I was 20. Was having trouble finding work and wasnt having any luck with romantic prospects. I also feared for my future ambitions when I get out of college. Because the college campus may be accepting. But I have come to understand it as a fantasy land that is nothing like the real world. I did end up finding a job. And women have approached me more. But its kind of miserable bottling who I am up. I know that its for the greater good. And that I am far more likelier to succeed if I do. But still its not great. I always had the intention to come back out. When I had enough money to go through surgeries and to be passable. But  that aricle and the comments  just makes me even more afraid to transition by fear of being labelled as a predator. I mean I'm not. I don't fetishise lesbians. I just feel like that is who I am and I feel more of a romantic attraction towards women. Im not even that much into sex tbh. I just really want a romantic partner more than anything.  IDK. Just seems like it's a lose lose situation no matter what I choose to do. And Im not getting any younger. Im 22 now. And it feels like I am just living an empty husk of a like. I rarely get excited anymore. Im not really happy. I dont necessarily feel sad. But I feel indifferent. I was much more different before I went back in. I was a young punk who had all these dreams. I dreamt of a world where everyone could live in harmony, And as I have gotten older, I see that as a fantasy. I see my decision to go back in the closet as neccessary because in this world, its survival of the fittest. And I must adapt to survive. Even if it means casting aside my emotions. I dont want to be another statisitc that you see of those trans people who end up homeless or without jobs. I wont be that. I refuse. I dont even know why Im on reddit tbh.

First off, this isn't a post to hook up, I realize this subreddit isn't for that, and that is not why I'm posting this. Please read through before judging or assuming, and mods, please don't delete,or if you do, please direct me to some place I could talk about my issues.

So, I've been with my fiance for near 5 years now (im 27 now, she's nearing 26 October) and.. we are good on a lot of aspects but there are some that bug me a lot and over time is driving me away to other avenues. Some being maturity  (on her part, I know I'm not perfect either) another big thing is sexual.

I'm very active in that regard, but not asking to do crazy things but she.. doesn't generally want it a lot. And when we do, it's the same. No foreplay, no oral etc. Never a random hj or something, anything sexual is always only insert into hole till finished (lol).

  I have tried talking to about these things many times over the years and it ends up just her saying she doesn't like it, not comfortable (some kinks I get, but be willing to experiment? I'm not asking anything crazy. I'd do anything for her just to make her happy), doesn't like the taste (oral) etc.. yet she likes oral on her (but she doesn't force or even ask me to do it since, she won't kiss until I wash my mouth out for example).




Why am I posting this here you may ask? Well.. I've been getting fed up and despite other aspects of us going well, it's making it harder to not get 'distracted'-_- if you catch my drift.

This.. is leading me to want to find someone else and I feel like shit thinking this way. I've been cheated on, a lot, and she's the first that hasn't for background plot..

I'm a normal male, no I don't plan or think about transitioning, I'm comfortable being me. But.. I'm extremely attracted to trans. (MtF-that.. well look very feminine. I guess that's after hrt? I am oblivious to terms so excuse me on this), and.. oddly enough when I think about my future, I see myself with a person like that. Not with my current partner.  

When and.. if we break about.. how would I even go about finding someone? I'm not very social but I'm not awkward. I do have a hard time talking to people at first though - I take a while to open up. So I don't exactly go to places and talk much..

Again, please do not take this the wrong way. It's asking for advice on my situation and also a question. 


I don't get why my ideal dreams of me growing old is with a trans, but it is what it is. Is it an aftereffect of the issues of my current relation and my mind focusing heavily on lust? Possibly. But the thought of finding someone and making them feel special, holding them close and just living a hapy life together makes me happy.. just imagining  it.

I think online roleplay helped me realize something was going on, because for some strange reason, I only felt comfortable as female roles. The few times I was male in roleplay, I was not comfortable with it. Thoughts started conjuring up in my head occasionally, like “why do I want to be girl characters all the time?” I even thought about scenarios about how “things would’ve been better if I were born a female.” It occurred to me I wanted to be them in reality, but I only figured out the true depth of my issue when my closest online friend said that I always did come off as “feminine,” and he assumed I was actually a girl until I stated otherwise. 

That’s when it hit me. I **wanted** to be a girl... I don’t think I’ve ever had a more shocking revelation in just about my entire life, but it felt like something in me was awoken, and it was by no means a bad moment. With this turning point also came an impending wave of absolute doubt. I started looking it up, and looked at the symptoms of gender dysphoria. I know I’ve always felt a little uncomfortable being male, but my childhood seemed totally normal, in fact pretty typical for a boy. I got all the nerf guns, rocked all the monster movies, and played baseball up until middle school! But... I began to suspect my “feminine self” is hidden under a highly deep wall of insecurities which is why I seemed so “normal” in the first place. I’ve always felt just a bit different, enough to set me at unease. Yet, somehow? I’m still ashamed of myself. Many discouraging thoughts run through my head daily.. “You aren’t feminine enough.” “Your parents wouldn’t understand.” “You’re just being selfish, with your desires.” “Are you even dysphoric? Or are you making yourself believe you are?” It crushed my confidence, for a while, and I refused to admit it to anyone until recently. I’ve been gaining *at least ENOUGH* confidence, and I’ve admitted I wanted to be a female to a couple friends in marching band now. All of them are accepting about it, and it felt like a big relief! But... I feel uncertain I’m in the right direction. As if there’s this ominous abominable wall stopping me, a block, a preventative thought. And well... That thought, is that I’m just wrong. Wrong that I think this way, wrong that I may not be the handsome man my parents want me to be, wrong that I have been willing to go this far. It’s this big mental war, and it’s really hard to tell which side is going to win. That’s why I’m here of course! So... what are *your* thoughts on all this?

I've always felt a bit different since I was younger. I'm a female, but ever since I was little I always wanted to be a boy. I always cut my hair short, I dressed like a boy, I would even try to pee standing up on a stool (this didn't go very well lol). I was always refered to as a Tom boy. I wanted to be just like my dad. I would even go shirtless as a kid before I grew breasts.

Once I got older I started to grow out of it. I grew my hair out and started to act more feminine. I've never really thought anything of it.

As an adult, once I became sexually active I soon discovered this fetish of watching guys pee. I love everything about it. It's a huge turn on and I find myself obsessing about it. 

I myself have always been so envious of men. I've fantasized about having a penis, peeing standing up, masturbating as a man. 

Fast forward to now. I've been married 8 years, I have two beautiful children. I love my husband so much. Sometimes I feel like I almost have this obsession with his penis. I love to watch him pee (especially in urinals). I always just want to hold, look, or just play with his penis . I don't think this is normal behaviour. I don't know.

I also bought this device that allows woman to stand up to pee (gogirl) and I will try and go into the locked bathrooms sometimes (the ones with both a toilet and urinal) and I'll use the gogirl to pee standing up in the urinal. I find this really exciting.

One of the reasons I'm posting this is because yesterday I came across this post on reddit talking about trans woman who take testosterone and their clit increases in size almost like a small penis. This was so cool and interesting to me.

I guess in summary I am just very confused and could really use some advise from people. How did you know you were trans?

I do like being a woman, I'm happy with my life and my family. I can't even imagine telling anyone how I feel. I'm terrified what they would think. But I can't help feeling this emptiness like something is missing...

I didn't know what to say. I still don't know what to say. He said the way I act and speak that I give a lot of signs of being trans and I just don't know. 

I'm 25 and married to a wonderful man who had already assured that no matter what he will love me 100%.

Sure, I act girly sometimes- I am most definitely baby with my stuffies and need of feetie pajamas- but in my mind I've never seen myself as a girl. To me I'm just... Me? I like the aspect of wearing heels and having an hourglass figure but at the same time I can only look at myself in the mirror and honestly love myself when I'm wearing a loose shirt that makes me look masculine. People call meSir in public and at work and it feels nice. I even pretended to be a guy fora day or twowhile working a music festival in job corps a few years back and I went from quiet and socially anxious to a social butterfly that had all the confidence in the world.

2019-09-17 03:50:04,d5blym,3,2,"Hello everyone,

my question is pretty simple! I've been taking finasteride for about a year now and seen incredible hair growth results, and have been using minoxidil for about two years. Now that I'm on HRT and Minoxidil, I was wondering if I would stop seeing the benefits or Rogaine if I stopped using it at this point. I think most of the hair regrowth I got from was from Finasteride, so I figure that stopping wouldn't be an issue. Both my doctor's said it was up to me, I'm very scared though at this point becuase my hair is finally at a place where I am comfortable wearing it without a wig and would rather not go back to that place in my life. 

thanks!

2019-09-18 04:47:59,d5ssru,1,1,"So, I'm questioning pretty intensely right now about whether I'm MtF transgender, and there are a couple roadblocks to me accepting myself if I am. First, I'm definitely not sure. I've always been effeminate, and the questioning hasn't really started until the last few months (Sporadically beforehand, but never more than a few days)  


Unfortunately, I'm a very hands on person when it comes to self discovery. I came out as bi after having been physical with both genders, but until then it was just theoretical. The problem comes in that if I immerse myself like that with the trans community, I've seen some pretty hostile behavior towards people who land on the side of the fence where they aren't transgender. In real life is out of the question since I'm not willing to take such a huge step for something that I'm not sure about.

I'm a queer person but I am not trans. A common transphobic argument I've been encountering from people is that ""Wanting to be trans is just mental illness"". I'm trying to think of the most simple and effective thing to say back when I hear that and I'd like to get feedback from the trans community so I'm best reflecting their actual thoughts. What I've thought of so far is:

""There is a legitimate feeling that trans people have for wanting to be what they are that is not related to their mental state. Mental illness is the result of trauma and pressures that don't allow a person to live as they want to. While trans people disproportionately experience these things, their motivation comes from a desire for identity, which is something more fundamental to us as humans than our mental state. Mental illness may be caused by not having a proper identity but mental illness is not an identity.""

I had been scheduled to go into Manhattan today to have the gender marker on my passport updated.  :)

But, due to this upcoming move, I'm finding myself reconsidering. I know many trans people have had difficulty with this process over the last year, with minor (or nonexistent) procedural errors being cited as justification.

If my address is changing, across the whole country, in the middle of the approval process...that feels like more than enough excuse for some bigoted State Department official who wants to give a trans applicant a hard time, right?

But then, I have a separate concern about waiting until LA (besides my impatience), which is the October 8 oral arguments before the Supreme Court re: queer folks' employment rights. 

I'm worried about my passport being in-process while this happens (I've heard the process takes 2 weeks, best-case), either because the right-leaning Court could make some farther-reaching scary determination regarding trans rights , or just because transness being in-the-news might empower some bureaucratic bigot to block me up.

I'm probably overthinking this -- and I'm realizing now that SCOTUS decisions don't happen \*right\* after oral arguments, though I'm unclear on how long that wait usually is -- but, of course, I'm worried about the possibility, however remote, of winding up without a passport. For unfortunately-obvious reasons, I place a high priority on maintaining the option to leave this country.

So I want to start with I haven’t told a single soul, online or otherwise, that I may be trans (FtM). I’ve sort of thought it for years, in an r/egg_irl way, but the past 6 months or so I’ve been coming to terms with it amongst myself. 

I don’t know how to tell my boyfriend. I don’t want to keep it from him, because he deserves to know. I know he’s not a transphobe, but I don’t think he’d be comfortable dating a man because he identifies as straight. We’re 21 and have been dating for over two years. I love him more than anything and he loves me. We’ve discussed marriage. I want to lose him like I want a hole in the head (that is, not at all).

2019-09-20 14:57:36,d6w3mh,0,11,"There's a trans YouTuber I discovereda few months ago because she did some nice reviews of anime and manga (some rather obscure or old) with trans characters.

Unfortunately, she hit on some hard times and lost internet access (and possibly a place to live, from context). 😞 Although she only has a couple hundred subscribers, I suspect it has been a source of catharsis to be able to post these reviews and other videos, so losing that (possibly on top of living place stability) must have been very hard.

I've been very concerned for her. She has been extremely self-deprecating in text posts in the past. I invited her to join us here on trans Reddit, hoping it would be a supportive environment, but she didn't respond to the invitation. She seems extremely depressed.

Here's the worst of it, though:

Recently I decided to check out her Twitter, and 3 days ago she made two posts saying she was going to commit suicide one way or another. 😰 Worse yet, no one responded (until I did today).

I'm not sure how it works, but she seems to have had direct messages disabled on both Twitter and YouTube.

I could really use some reinforcements here for a trans sister. She's a really nice person and needs to know that she has value, something that many people have apparently been denying. Here are her YouTube channel and Twitter page:

So I've finally decided to take the plunge and go to therapy in hopes of one day starting HRT, however I'm a bit apprehensive about a few things.

Mainly, absolutely no one knows that I'm trans. Hell, I refused to truly acknowledge it up until recently, which leaves me in a situation where when asked why I want to go to therapy, namely by my parents, I tell them it's for 'some personal things' and that it's 'no big issue'.

Should I out before I begin therapy? During? After I (hopefully) get the OK to transition?

2019-09-21 15:21:50,d7btu2,9,1,"Hey everyone!

So, I have a topic that I think is gonna get a lot of hate. I hope I am proved wrong. But, I am going to add a little disclaimer here. 

*This is not meant to target or offend anybody. This post was made in good faith in hopes to address a problem I have seen in the trans community. Everyone is their own person and this does not imply that all trans people are easily offended but rather that a sizeable portion of our community may be easily offended by content not meant to offend. To clarify even further, while it's fine for us to be offended by something the concern I have is when we aggressively respond to someone who said or did something in good faith.*

  
**Do us trans peeps get offended easily?**

So, it's a stereotype that trans people get offended easily. Now, if it were just a stereotype alone I wouldn't care but I've repeatedly found significant evidence of this in my experiences. Exhibit A is my local LGBTQ Outreach Center Facebook Group. I've seen trans people go absolutely off on other trans people for a difference in opinion. This caused and continues to cause many trans people seeking help to leave the LGBTQ community due to this toxic behavior. 

I'm not talking about posts meant to offend. I am talking about posts made in good faith. All it takes is one person to be triggered and then there is a storm in the comments. I've seen people's status as transgender questioned, I've seen people told insultingly to ""stay in the closet,"" I've seen a lot of toxic behavior from how some trans people treat other trans people over differences in opinion. These arguments are typically political. Now, there are many politicians that want to dehumanize trans people, minorities, just bad politicians overall. I think some of us, if we see someone with conservative views for example, automatically assign all the worst qualities of conservatives to that person without taking into account that they're a human with a complex belief system and most of the time they're not a stereotype.

I heard somewhere that one trans person said that just because they were trans they got the reputation of being the ""easily offended"" person in their friend group and that really sucks. We as trans people are a persecuted group around the world. We have many different things to be offended about like transphobes trying to invalidate us. But, possibly because of this persecution and the fact we're on the butt end of many transphobic comments and jokes that we are more likely to be offended at something. But, I find that often we're offended over dumb stuff. I made a post a little bit ago that was a basic trans validation meme but the meme format had Pewdiepie in it (the one where he is pointing to a screen or a board or something). That got a little backlash because I posted a ""fascist"" on a trans meme. While I didn't do too much research into this, I asked in the comments why Pewdie is considered a fascist. Nobody gave me a good reason. Most people pointed out the iron cross on his collar. Which, depresses me because this alone shows one of the reasons they hate Pewdie and regard him as a ""fascist"" is based out of ignorance.

The iron cross is a common symbol in today's society and doesn't have racial implications. However, the implication they perceive dates back to Nazi Germany where the iron cross was a symbol of the Wehrmacht (I'm a bit of a history nerd). Which... doesn't make him a fascist. The Iron Cross is still used as a symbol of Germany's army today, which proves that there were no hateful implications seeing how Germany did a total wipe of Nazism and now makes the display of the nazi flag and presumably other Nazi-related symbols illegal in Germany. I've seen beautiful photos of Germans being arrested for doing the Nazi salute. You could also make the argument about that incident regarding the Fiverr incident where he got someone to write on a sign ""death to all Jews"" or something similar. While this wasn't tasteful at all and people can make the argument that by even joking about something like that they're normalizing it, at the end of the day it was meant as a joke.

We cannot forget that people are human with flaws. We do not all share the same knowledge. We've taken many different paths in life and come up with different opinions and character traits. We're united together as all being trans. But, trans or not, we must remember that we're all human. I get it. If someone dehumanizes us and you dehumanize them... I am not blaming you. But, we cannot dehumanize people for simply having different opinions.

I'll touch on one more topic that I think might be a factor in this issue. **Validation.** As I said earlier, there are many who want to invalidate us as people. It's good to have some validation but remember, no matter what, science backs the existence of trans people. People who attempt to invalidate us are on the wrong side of scientific facts. Why am I mentioning this? Well, I feel like it *might* be a possibility that insecurity regarding validation and how the world sees us put some of us on the defensive and thus more easily to be offended by something.

I could be totally wrong with the reasons why I think this might be a problem. One thing is for certain though, you are human. I am human. We're all trying to get by on this Earth. We shouldn't waste minutes of our life feeling angry at something that wasn't intended to offend anybody. We shouldn't invalidate or fight with ourselves when we are having a hard enough time with transphobes and the such. I don't want to be treated any differently because I am trans. Being trans is not my personality. And, I definitely don't want my friends to think that they have to tiptoe around eggshells when they're around me. The ability to make fun of yourself a little is a good trait and puts people at ease. It's okay to be offended, but it's not okay to treat someone badly when they didn't intend any harm or offense.

I hope I am proved wrong. But, I am going to add a little disclaimer here. \n\n*This is not meant to target or offend anybody. This post was made in good faith in hopes to address a problem I have seen in the trans community. Everyone is their own person and this does not imply that all trans people are easily offended but rather that a sizeable portion of our community may be easily offended by content not meant to offend. To clarify even further, while it\'s fine for us to be offended by something the concern I have is when we aggressively respond to someone who said or did something in good faith.*\n\n  \n**Do us trans peeps get offended easily?**\n\nSo, it\'s a stereotype that trans people get offended easily. Now, if it were just a stereotype alone I wouldn\'t care but I\'ve repeatedly found significant evidence of this in my experiences. Exhibit A is my local LGBTQ Outreach Center Facebook Group. I\'ve seen trans people go absolutely off on other trans people for a difference in opinion. This caused and continues to cause many trans people seeking help to leave the LGBTQ community due to this toxic behavior. \n\nI\'m not talking about posts meant to offend. I am talking about posts made in good faith. All it takes is one person to be triggered and then there is a storm in the comments. I\'ve seen people\'s status as transgender questioned, I\'ve seen people told insultingly to ""stay in the closet,"" I\'ve seen a lot of toxic behavior from how some trans people treat other trans people over differences in opinion. These arguments are typically political. Now, there are many politicians that want to dehumanize trans people, minorities, just bad politicians overall. I think some of us, if we see someone with conservative views for example, automatically assign all the worst qualities of conservatives to that person without taking into account that they\'re a human with a complex belief system and most of the time they\'re not a stereotype.\n\nI heard somewhere that one trans person said that just because they were trans they got the reputation of being the ""easily offended"" person in their friend group and that really sucks. We as trans people are a persecuted group around the world. We have many different things to be offended about like transphobes trying to invalidate us. But, possibly because of this persecution and the fact we\'re on the butt end of many transphobic comments and jokes that we are more likely to be offended at something. But, I find that often we\'re offended over dumb stuff. I made a post a little bit ago that was a basic trans validation meme but the meme format had Pewdiepie in it (the one where he is pointing to a screen or a board or something). That got a little backlash because I posted a ""fascist"" on a trans meme. While I didn\'t do too much research into this, I asked in the comments why Pewdie is considered a fascist. Nobody gave me a good reason. Most people pointed out the iron cross on his collar. Which, depresses me because this alone shows one of the reasons they hate Pewdie and regard him as a ""fascist"" is based out of ignorance.\n\nThe iron cross is a common symbol in today\'s society and doesn\'t have racial implications. However, the implication they perceive dates back to Nazi Germany where the iron cross was a symbol of the Wehrmacht (I\'m a bit of a history nerd). Which... doesn\'t make him a fascist. The Iron Cross is still used as a symbol of Germany\'s army today, which proves that there were no hateful implications seeing how Germany did a total wipe of Nazism and now makes the display of the nazi flag and presumably other Nazi-related symbols illegal in Germany. I\'ve seen beautiful photos of Germans being arrested for doing the Nazi salute. You could also make the argument about that incident regarding the Fiverr incident where he got someone to write on a sign ""death to all Jews"" or something similar. While this wasn\'t tasteful at all and people can make the argument that by even joking about something like that they\'re normalizing it, at the end of the day it was meant as a joke.\n\nWe cannot forget that people are human with flaws. We do not all share the same knowledge. We\'ve taken many different paths in life and come up with different opinions and character traits. We\'re united together as all being trans. But, trans or not, we must remember that we\'re all human. I get it. If someone dehumanizes us and you dehumanize them... I am not blaming you. But, we cannot dehumanize people for simply having different opinions.\n\nI\'ll touch on one more topic that I think might be a factor in this issue. **Validation.** As I said earlier, there are many who want to invalidate us as people. It\'s good to have some validation but remember, no matter what, science backs the existence of trans people. People who attempt to invalidate us are on the wrong side of scientific facts. Why am I mentioning this? Well, I feel like it *might* be a possibility that insecurity regarding validation and how the world sees us put some of us on the defensive and thus more easily to be offended by something.\n\nI could be totally wrong with the reasons why I think this might be a problem. One thing is for certain though, you are human. I am human. We\'re all trying to get by on this Earth. We shouldn\'t waste minutes of our life feeling angry at something that wasn\'t intended to offend anybody. We shouldn\'t invalidate or fight with ourselves when we are having a hard enough time with transphobes and the such. I don\'t want to be treated any differently because I am trans. Being trans is not my personality. And, I definitely don\'t want my friends to think that they have to tiptoe around eggshells when they\'re around me. The ability to make fun of yourself a little is a good trait and puts people at ease. It\'s okay to be offended, but it\'s not okay to treat someone badly when they didn\'t intend any harm or offense. We should treasure logical and reasonable debate over Facebook arguments that take years off of our life.\n\n***I am interested to see civilized discussion in the comments below regarding this issue.

# Hello all,

I recently had Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS) done on May 28th, 2019. I had the procedures done in Guadalajara, Mexico by Dr. Lazaro Cardenas and the [TransOp.com](https://Transop.com) team. The procedures I had done are:

* Hairline Lowered
* Type III Forehead Contour
* Brow Lift
* Rhinoplasty (Nose job)
* Upper Lip Lift
* Fat injections to Lips
* Chin Contour
* Jaw Contour
* Chin Implant
* Buccal Fat Pads Removal (Cheeks)

It has been 3.5 months since the surgery and I feel great. I had no complications whatsoever (thank god). Honestly, at this time, it is difficult to see any major changes in the face on what was done. As much as I may personally struggle to see the differences I must say that the dysphoria I had with looking in the mirror is all but gone. The biggest changes I noticed already are a slight puff to my lips, my nose is completely different and my brows are more shaped. I still struggle to see differences in cheek, jaw and chin areas but don't really have any complaints about it, though I may have wished the surgeon to be a bit more aggressive on the areas. There is, of course, still swelling in all the areas, particularly the nose, but I feel I can get a good understanding of what my face will look like down the coming months. All surgeons advise to wait and see a full year after surgery for the final results though so hopefully it will only get better :).

I will add more photos in the future detailing the differences of the side profile. 

# Why Mexico?

  
There were several reasons why I finally decided on going to Mexico for the surgery. The main reason was the price. Healthcare in Mexico is much cheaper than America and thus less expensive for cosmetic surgery. Several of the surgeons I really liked the work of and had consults with, including Dr. Spiegel in Boston, varied far too much from patient to patient. Part the reason I really liked transop was that they were transparent with the prices and everyone pays the same for the same procedures. I was quoted well over 30-50k+ USD for all the procedures listed by various surgeons in America that I had in person and skype consults with. In the end, I was quoted roughly 20k USD for transop and paid about 25k with tax, plane tickets and other various unexpected expenses (additional prescriptions, compression garments etc). 

Another reason was that Dr. Cardenas during the Skype consultation actually talked me out of some procedures which significantly reduced the price. It was a little reassuring to see that he wasn't just after the money and going to suggest a bunch of unnecessary things. Aside from chopping off several procedures entirely, he said he could get the same results I wanted while doing other, less invasive procedures or while doing another unrelated procedure. I mainly refer to the fact that my right eyelid/brow was slightly lower than my left. One of my biggest hangups when looking at myself in the mirror. One surgery told me I would need a procedure just for that. Cardenas was able to correct that simply during the brow lift by lifting the right side slightly higher than the left. This saved me about 2-3k that could have been wasted on. A simple fix for the thing that bothered me the most!

# The Facility

  
I have been to over 15 plastic surgeon offices and even had surgeries at different hospitals in America and can still, without a doubt, say that the Innovare Hospital that the surgery was done at was by far one of the most advanced, clean and modern medical facilities I have ever been to. I know Mexico tends to have a bad stigma when it may come to cleanliness or at least that is the general consensus it seems many Americans have about it. If you ever look to transop for surgery this is absolutely going to be no concern. 

# Dr. Cardenas and the TransOp Team

  
From my Skype consult to Surgery was about 1.3 years apart. I was pleasantly surprised again at how well Dr. Cardenas spoke English and had no trouble understanding or explaining what I wanted or needed. During our consult, he actually convinced me not to go for some procedures as he thought it wouldn't achieve what I wanted or that he could get the same look with something less expensive. Before the consult, I had a quote from the website for about 26k. After, it was down to 18k. I opted to go for an additional optional \[to me\] procedure when I got to Mexico which bumped it up to around 20k. 

The team themselves were very professional and friendly. All the doctors seemed to speak English, some better than others. The anesthesiologist was intent on making me laugh before putting me under (she succeeded). There were 4 doctors that I could tell performing the actual surgery. Dr. Cardenas' wife is an ENT. She did not perform the Rhinoplasty but her \[fellow?\] was in the surgery and I believe he did. He was the one who took care of all my post-op visits regarding the rhinoplasty aftercare. Before leaving my last appointment I met with his wife to get my nose checked out one last time. 

The only downsides I have experienced and heard from others is that he is not aggressive enough with Forehead Contours (not my main concern anyway) and Jaw/Chin contours. If you go be VERY CLEAR AND PRECISE with what you want it to look like and how aggressive he should be. Do not skip on the details with your one in-person consultation with your surgeon! I literally brought a picture of the nose I wanted. And that is exactly what I got and am extremely happy with the results. 

# The Recovery House

  
The recovery house is SUPER clean. There are two women here who cook and clean daily. The house would regularly smell faintly of cleaning products because they clean everything at least once a day sometimes twice. The beds are changed daily and laundry can be done if you choose to pay for it. They regularly left the windows and doors to the backyard open. It was late May - Early June and there was little to no bugs around. The temperature varied from 70-90 F but was not uncomfortable as the location is the high altitude and didn't have much humidity until I left around mid-June. It was still much more tolerable than where I currently live. 

Vincente runs the recovery house and is an absolutely amazing man. He will pick you up from the airport, drop off and pick you up from appointments, pick up prescriptions, and drop you off at the airport when you are leaving. He was sweet, funny, caring and spoke English very well. *He has two doggos - Lucas and Luci who are the sweetest doggos*. They honestly made the recovery that much easier as they regularly would come sit with me on the couch when I was resting in the common areas and let me pet them. 

***Food*** \- I am a very picky eater myself. The two women who work here don't speak any English but Vincente would often ask if there was anything particular I wanted to eat. They did their best to accommodate me. The morning would have some cereal, bread, donuts, and other pastries. The afternoon lunch/dinner would have just about any variety of food you could ask for. After surgery, I mostly ate soft bread, apple juice, ice pops, and pasta.

***Rooms*** \- When I asked how many rooms there were I believe he said he could have 7 people total staying there. There were 2 rooms with two single beds and another 2 with double beds. I didn't explore the entire house though so this could be a bit wrong. I went with my mom so we had the largest room that had 2 single beds, a TV and a loft area that didn't seem furnished at the time. It had a balcony and its own bathroom. I believe two of the rooms had their bathroom outside the room. There were no other girls staying at the house while I was there until my last couple of days. There was a German girl who came in in the middle of the night and had surgery shortly after. I was, unfortunately, unable to meet her since she was recovering and I didn't want to disturb her. 

# Pain

  
As someone who has fairly low pain tolerance, I must say that all the procedures I had very little pain. I would just describe it all as intense discomfort for the first few days. After the straws came out of my nose and they cleaned it up it was much easier in the coming days. Swelling reducing meds were far more effective than painkillers. I did have to ask for sleep pills though as the swelling/discomfort did keep me up at night and because my sleep schedule was all messed up.

# Final Tips

  
If you do plan to go keep in mind the following:

* Get your passport well in advance. Do not wait for the last minute.
* Try to avoid the Mexican airline if possible... I believe Delta or American Airlines fly out of Guadalajara and I am sure you will enjoy it more for the additional money. 
* They will only accept credit/debit. They regularly have to turn people away because they are unable to pay due to credit companies thinking it is a fraudulent charge or credit limits not high enough. Call your card companies before leaving. Sooner if you are leaving on a holiday weekend/time frame. 
* Use a card that has no foreign transaction fees if possible. Otherwise, account for the increased payment for the conversion USD to Peso. 
* Take into account a 4-5% tax to be added onto your totals. This is not accounted for in the quotes.
* I am not sure if this was intended to be included or an addon charge but I had to pay about $1200 for the hospital stay. This was a separate charge but I am not 100% sure if it was intended to be in the original quote since I added additional procedures after I got to Mexico. 
* Keep $500-700 cash on you for emergencies. I didn't see any place I needed to use cash but I can only imagine. I also tipped Vincente and the two women who worked at the recovery house. Some local shops accept USD but you can have it converted if you plan to look around the city. 
* Again, be extremely precise with your surgeon on what you want done and how aggressive you want it to be. Bring pictures (it couldn't hurt).
* Bring someone with you if you can - aside from the plane ticket, it is free to stay for them!
* If you are American - Register with the US Embassy's website for Guadalajara before you leave.

# Final Thoughts

I do believe that I expected to see more aggressive results but I am not dissatisfied. I am content with what I got and paid for and do not have any regrets. Overall my dysphoria has gone done quite a bit. In the end, it is not for others but myself and as long as I am happy. :)   
I hope this may help anyone who may have been unsure of going to a foreign country for surgery or anything. I still am a firm believer in telling people that have consultations with many surgeons and pick who you feel the most confident in. Do your research. Dig deep enough and any surgeon is going to have some bad reviews. If surgery is on your mind it is up to you.

I hope this helps someone, even just one person :)

Tell me what you think! Do you see the differences in my face as well? Please feel free to message me or ask ANY questions :)",trans,FFS Review Dr. Cardenas - Transop - Mexico - Before and After,1569161337.0,"{'created_utc': 1569136137, 'id': 'd7n40q', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 9, 'selftext': ""&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Blue dress Nov 2018 - Plaid Shirt \\(light makeup\\) Sept 2019.](https://i.redd.it/a264w6asx2o31.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Hello all,\n\nI recently had Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS) done on May 28th, 2019. I had the procedures done in Guadalajara, Mexico by Dr. Lazaro Cardenas and the [TransOp.com](https://Transop.com) team. The procedures I had done are:\n\n* Hairline Lowered\n* Type III Forehead Contour\n* Brow Lift\n* Rhinoplasty (Nose job)\n* Upper Lip Lift\n* Fat injections to Lips\n* Chin Contour\n* Jaw Contour\n* Chin Implant\n* Buccal Fat Pads Removal (Cheeks)\n\nIt has been 3.5 months since the surgery and I feel great. I had no complications whatsoever (thank god). Honestly, at this time, it is difficult to see any major changes in the face on what was done. As much as I may personally struggle to see the differences I must say that the dysphoria I had with looking in the mirror is all but gone. The biggest changes I noticed already are a slight puff to my lips, my nose is completely different and my brows are more shaped. I still struggle to see differences in cheek, jaw and chin areas but don't really have any complaints about it, though I may have wished the surgeon to be a bit more aggressive on the areas. There is, of course, still swelling in all the areas, particularly the nose, but I feel I can get a good understanding of what my face will look like down the coming months. All surgeons advise to wait and see a full year after surgery for the final results though so hopefully it will only get better :).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Albums:\n\n[Before and After](https://imgur.com/a/3x5201m)\n\n[More Before](https://imgur.com/a/jMn0wYe)\n\n[More After](https://imgur.com/a/V3uQ1tc)\n\n[Post Surgical Pics (A bit gruesome)](https://imgur.com/a/ojcjRDT)\n\n[Recovery House and Guadalajara](https://imgur.com/a/jGBwzBn)\n\nI will add more photos in the future detailing the differences of the side profile. \n\n# Why Mexico?\n\n  \nThere were several reasons why I finally decided on going to Mexico for the surgery. The main reason was the price. Healthcare in Mexico is much cheaper than America and thus less expensive for cosmetic surgery. Several of the surgeons I really liked the work of and had consults with, including Dr. Spiegel in Boston, varied far too much from patient to patient. Part the reason I really liked transop was that they were transparent with the prices and everyone pays the same for the same procedures. I was quoted well over 30-50k+ USD for all the procedures listed by various surgeons in America that I had in person and skype consults with. In the end, I was quoted roughly 20k USD for transop and paid about 25k with tax, plane tickets and other various unexpected expenses (additional prescriptions, compression garments etc). \n\nAnother reason was that Dr. Cardenas during the Skype consultation actually talked me out of some procedures which significantly reduced the price. It was a little reassuring to see that he wasn't just after the money and going to suggest a bunch of unnecessary things. Aside from chopping off several procedures entirely, he said he could get the same results I wanted while doing other, less invasive procedures or while doing another unrelated procedure. I mainly refer to the fact that my right eyelid/brow was slightly lower than my left. One of my biggest hangups when looking at myself in the mirror. One surgery told me I would need a procedure just for that. Cardenas was able to correct that simply during the brow lift by lifting the right side slightly higher than the left. This saved me about 2-3k that could have been wasted on. A simple fix for the thing that bothered me the most!\n\n# The Facility\n\n  \nI have been to over 15 plastic surgeon offices and even had surgeries at different hospitals in America and can still, without a doubt, say that the Innovare Hospital that the surgery was done at was by far one of the most advanced, clean and modern medical facilities I have ever been to. I know Mexico tends to have a bad stigma when it may come to cleanliness or at least that is the general consensus it seems many Americans have about it. If you ever look to transop for surgery this is absolutely going to be no concern. \n\n# Dr. Cardenas and the TransOp Team\n\n  \nFrom my Skype consult to Surgery was about 1.3 years apart. I was pleasantly surprised again at how well Dr. Cardenas spoke English and had no trouble understanding or explaining what I wanted or needed. During our consult, he actually convinced me not to go for some procedures as he thought it wouldn't achieve what I wanted or that he could get the same look with something less expensive. Before the consult, I had a quote from the website for about 26k. After, it was down to 18k. I opted to go for an additional optional \\[to me\\] procedure when I got to Mexico which bumped it up to around 20k. \n\nThe team themselves were very professional and friendly. All the doctors seemed to speak English, some better than others. The anesthesiologist was intent on making me laugh before putting me under (she succeeded). There were 4 doctors that I could tell performing the actual surgery. Dr. Cardenas' wife is an ENT. She did not perform the Rhinoplasty but her \\[fellow?\\] was in the surgery and I believe he did. He was the one who took care of all my post-op visits regarding the rhinoplasty aftercare. Before leaving my last appointment I met with his wife to get my nose checked out one last time. \n\nThe only downsides I have experienced and heard from others is that he is not aggressive enough with Forehead Contours (not my main concern anyway) and Jaw/Chin contours. If you go be VERY CLEAR AND PRECISE with what you want it to look like and how aggressive he should be. Do not skip on the details with your one in-person consultation with your surgeon! I literally brought a picture of the nose I wanted. And that is exactly what I got and am extremely happy with the results. \n\n# The Recovery House\n\n  \nThe recovery house is SUPER clean. There are two women here who cook and clean daily. The house would regularly smell faintly of cleaning products because they clean everything at least once a day sometimes twice. The beds are changed daily and laundry can be done if you choose to pay for it. They regularly left the windows and doors to the backyard open. It was late May - Early June and there was little to no bugs around. The temperature varied from 70-90 F but was not uncomfortable as the location is the high altitude and didn't have much humidity until I left around mid-June. It was still much more tolerable than where I currently live. \n\nVincente runs the recovery house and is an absolutely amazing man. He will pick you up from the airport, drop off and pick you up from appointments, pick up prescriptions, and drop you off at the airport when you are leaving. He was sweet, funny, caring and spoke English very well. *He has two doggos - Lucas and Luci who are the sweetest doggos*. They honestly made the recovery that much easier as they regularly would come sit with me on the couch when I was resting in the common areas and let me pet them. \n\n***Food*** \\- I am a very picky eater myself. The two women who work here don't speak any English but Vincente would often ask if there was anything particular I wanted to eat. They did their best to accommodate me. The morning would have some cereal, bread, donuts, and other pastries. The afternoon lunch/dinner would have just about any variety of food you could ask for. After surgery, I mostly ate soft bread, apple juice, ice pops, and pasta.\n\n***Rooms*** \\- When I asked how many rooms there were I believe he said he could have 7 people total staying there. There were 2 rooms with two single beds and another 2 with double beds. I didn't explore the entire house though so this could be a bit wrong. I went with my mom so we had the largest room that had 2 single beds, a TV and a loft area that didn't seem furnished at the time. It had a balcony and its own bathroom. I believe two of the rooms had their bathroom outside the room. There were no other girls staying at the house while I was there until my last couple of days. There was a German girl who came in in the middle of the night and had surgery shortly after. I was, unfortunately, unable to meet her since she was recovering and I didn't want to disturb her. \n\n# Pain\n\n  \nAs someone who has fairly low pain tolerance, I must say that all the procedures I had very little pain. I would just describe it all as intense discomfort for the first few days. After the straws came out of my nose and they cleaned it up it was much easier in the coming days. Swelling reducing meds were far more effective than painkillers. I did have to ask for sleep pills though as the swelling/discomfort did keep me up at night and because my sleep schedule was all messed up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Tips\n\n  \nIf you do plan to go keep in mind the following:\n\n* Get your passport well in advance.

So, is it normal to be so jealous of other trans women? I know that is a silly question.

There is no way I could EVER be that pretty. I feel like there is some exclusive club that I missed out on, and now I have to be this manly looking woman forever, and I just can’t take it.

But I want to get over this. I just feel like this jealousy could be turned into something positive if I knew how to overcome it.

I'm sorry, I just have to vent about this.

I went home today and saw my parents and sister and visited with them for a while. I'm working on gathering the courage to come out to them at some point so that I can start on HRT. I'm 20 years old and my college provides free gender therapy and has a clinic that provides free hormones for HRT, so it isn't so much a matter of getting my parents' permission as it is knowing that eventually they'll find out one way or another and I'd rather they hear it from me before I start transitioning. They'll also need to know because I'd like to freeze some sperm to have kids down the road, but that's prohibitively expensive without financial help from my parents at the moment.

Now, my parents have never expressed any sentiments that would lead me to think they were transphobic, but they're certainly uneducated about gender theory and the like. My mom and sister have both made it clear multiple times when we've had casual conversations about gender stuff that they think being gender non-conforming is a choice that people make, and that people just ""decide"" they want to be another gender, and my dad is very anti-PC, so he's basically in the same boat.

I had a long debate with my dad today about gender stuff (we have friendly political debates pretty often, him being a libertarian and me being a liberal) pertaining to the recent addition of the singular ""they"" to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, partially because I wanted to sort of probe his reactions and see a bit more clearly how he might take it if his son came out to him as, well, a daughter. His arguments basically boiled down to non-conforming people wanting to make others live in their made-up reality in which they are some gender they weren't assigned at birth. From how I understood his argument he sees gender non-conformity as a delusion on the part of the non-conforming. 

Issues like these don't interest my mom and sister as much, but like I said, that's kind of resulted in them being pretty uneducated and thinking some pretty incorrect things. I will say that when I eventually come out to family it's going to be to my sister first, since she's been through her own alienating experiences with my parents in the past--namely, converting to a different religion, which my parents were none too pleased about--so hopefully she'll understand in a way that my parents can't. 

I guess the biggest wildcard in all of this is how my parents react when this is an issue that affects someone in their immediate family. I worry that I'll explain the situation to them and they'll brush it aside or dismiss it out of hand, a la ""we think this is just a phase"" or ""just decide to be a man again,"" like it's that easy. I definitely think the chances are slim that they'll pay for any sort of surgery, sperm banks, or HRT out of pocket, as they're pretty money-oriented people too. I'm just scared they won't accept me for who I am, or if they don't, then I'll be forced to either cut them out of my life or live as someone I'm not. That last possibility scares me a lot, because my parents have always loved and cared for me, and that's the one bridge I'm the most scared to burn in my process of coming out.

Cw: eating disorders, self harm, dysphoria

When I started college (three years ago) I was struggling to figure out my sexuality, which is when I found out there was a difference between romantic and sexual attraction. I was very uneducated on everything LGBTQ related because I have a pretty conservative family and my mom can be slightly everything-phobic. So coming to college I only knew that I wasn't straight. I knew vaguely of trans people but I never understood it and as time went on, I got more and more fustrated at my lack of knowledge of everything. Right around that time, I fell into a pretty diverse friend group and really started understanding myself more in general. I added a second major, got an on campus job, found a new passion, and joined a great organization on campus. I was also getting more in touch with my spirituality and I was feeling great. About a year ago, I became really close to a few FTM people and one MTF person. They were all so open about their experiences and open to helping me educate myself which I am still doing and greatful for. This past summer one of my friends came out as nonbinary and I started researching it to make sure I could be as accepting as possible when I got back to school. That's when I started cracking, but in reality it was like someone threw my fragile egg self onto the floor.

I had always had issues with the way I looked, I remember looking in the mirror in elementary school and feeling gross. I developed an eating disorder relatively early on because I noticed my body changing and I hated it, but I didn't know why. I gained weight despite hardly eating anything, and slowly began to develop like every other ""female"" my age. I remember going shopping for my first ""big girl"" undergarments and feeling sick, my mom told me it was just that I had to adjust to being a girl and I'd be fine. As I got older, the disconnect I had when looking at or trying on any clothes became unbearable at times, especially when I needed bras. Even before I knew what being trans was, I knew I really hated my chest and wanted to have it ""fixed"". I never really felt ""girly"" or ""boyish"" but I just thought that was normal. It wasn't until I became friends with the trans people I'm friends with today that I even realized that people feel gender. I truly thought it was just I have this body part so I am therefore this gender, because I was so uneducated. My ed had gotten bad in the early parts of this year, after being in recovery for a while. Over the summer someone really close to me came out as nonbinary and I had no idea how to support them because I had never heard about it before. As I started looking into it more online, here, and in other places I quickly started identifying with a lot of the things that I was reading about. I started looking back at my life and realizing that x time I had experienced dysphoria, and x thing was because of this or that. 

As I mentioned before,  over the last few years especially I got significantly more in tune with my spirituality, and although I dont have a lable for it, the best way to describe it is that I'm a pagan but I also just believe that everything happens for a reason and the universe has a plan.  Ive been working on trusting that belief which is one major thing that got me out of some really dark times, while also allowing me to honor those. So when I started connecting times in my life to dysphoria or to being moments where something felt disconnected and wrong regarding who I was, I asked myself if I could possibly be nonbinary. The second I asked that,  and thought yeah that is a possibility it felt like a huge weight was lifted off of me. The days of compulsively thinking ""I need to be skinny"" and feeling like the only time I was mre was when I was hungry almost instantly just left and were replaced with ""this is me and I can take care of this"". I felt like i was whole, like this part of me was just missing and I needed to have that one thing and now I did, it was something to identify with that made sense to me. Before I thought that to myself, I thought I was broken since i didnt have the urge to do girly things all the time and since I hated my chest it had the ocasional what if I was born a guy moments (I know how the hell didn't I know sooner is beyond me but I blame it on the lack of education). 

I've come out to a few of my closer friends, and asked all my friends to call me by a shortened version of my name. I'm not sure if I'm going to change my name or anything, partially because I have a rare name and partially because comming out at home isn't possible (which I'm 100% okay with because it's for my safety and as much as it sucks I know as long as I honor who I truly am for myself thats enough for me to be happy). But with realizing this, and the fact that I went through a really depressive part of life I need the change so I can fully be happy with myself again. I also decided that I'm going to talk to my doctor about having a breast reduction surgery (it's something I've been concodering long before I knew I was nonbinary because I have an uneven chest and it also causes back pain so yay fun times... but I also dont completely hate having a chest.) The last two and a half months have been intresting and while it's not what I expected I've had amazing people surrounding me and it feels really good to know myself more than I ever have. Especially having so many of my friends, most of whom have no idea what I'm going through being so acomidating and accepting of the whole name thing has been amazing. I'm still working on pronouns since I've been feeling more disconnected from but they/them also doesent feel right (I've been looking and trying out shi/hir  since it isnt a large shift from she/her especially since i can't come out at home but we shall see...) 

To me being nonbinary is just being a human. It's more of a lack of feeling for me than a specific feeling. Like I don't and never have identified with masculinity or femininity,  but I know I'm not lacking gender and I don't feel like I move from gender to gender. I just kinda am, like a rock in the middle of a river or something. 

But ever since I started questioning and realizing this, I've just really apreciated everyone more. Were all just trying to figure ourselves out and whether were just starting or we've known for years, we all just want to live and be happy. So I hope that's what we can all do, if not now than someday. I was inspired to say all this because I've seen so many posts about people wondering if they're trans or nonbinary and questioning what it feels like and stuff. I know that this is my own experience but I also felt like it was something I needed to get off my chest. 

TL;DR: I realized I'm nonbinary really quick and were all amazing and I hope you realize that. This was basically inspired by the amount of am i trans or questions about being and feeling nonbinary but idk...

This was basically inspired by the amount of am i trans or questions about being and feeling nonbinary but idk... \n\nQuestion: What is gender to you and how did you come to that explanation?

Several months ago, after a lot of thought, I came to the conclusion that I identify as non-binary. I identified as enby for a long time before I came out as a trans male and started taking hormones, but I think I felt a lot of societal pressure to really prove myself as ""male"" in order for the people around me to take me seriously and so I could get onto hrt faster and achieve the effects that I wanted my body to have, to feel more comfortable.
But as I've gotten more in touch with my non-binary identity, the things that I used to love about testosterone now cause me a considerable amount of dysphoria, namely the body/facial hair. I have a loooot of it and it grows so quickly that it gets hard to manage. 

Testosterone has been integral in helping my mental health and making me more comfy in my body and I don't believe I would ever want to completely stop taking it however I've been tossing up the idea of going onto a lower dose of testosterone but been wondering about a few things and I guess would appreciate some feedback and help. 

I've been curious about if going onto a lower dose would even do anything in terms of slowing hair growth? Am I just stuck with all of this hair? 
What other effects would it bring? Would it change my voice or anything else? 
I'm currently taking 130mg every two weeks subcutaneously

Additionally one big thing I've been nervous about is that if I do go on a lower dose, my period would return until I finally get a hysterectomy. 

I could probably deal with a period as it's happened before when I had a messed up dose switching from intramuscular to subq, but how would being on a lower dose affect my hormone levels if I do choose to have a hysterectomy? (I would likely be keeping one ovary so I would still be producing some estrogen)

At the same time it’s important for the play that the trans actor in question be male presenting. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time auditioning for a role that’s not right for them. 

I just want to make sure I’m both clear and tactful with the audition notice. 

Secondly, I know that casting trans characters (especially by cis actors) is an issue. What are your thoughts about opening up auditions for people who identify as non-binary/gender queer?

So first off, let me introduce myself. My name is Tyler and I'm FtM. I am 19 years old, 20 soon and have known that I've been trans for a very long time now. I have been in a straight relationship with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now. No one but my internet friends know about me being transgender.

I've been thinking about coming out for the past 2 months now.
I want to come out as soon as possible now, for the sake of my mental health which has been declining.

To start off, I live with my boyfriend and have for 2 years.
I'm not sure on his stance of transgender people. He's made jokes about them multiple times and I'm not sure if he's transphobic or not.

I want to come out to him first.

If he chooses to not continue our relationship, I'd understand but I'd have no where to go since I was recently fired and my parents live far away. 
So it's risky. But would improve my mental health either way. Sure the blow of losing a loved one will be incredibly hard for a while but in the long term we'd bother be happier...

And my parents? They're on really good terms with me. We never used to get along but since I moved out, our relationship had improved dramatically. 
I know they're semi transphobic and homophobic. 

I need to come out to everyone. I need to be me. I can't continue being female as my mental health is just suffering greatly.

2019-09-24 20:58:13,d8tc49,1,11,"I've questioned my gender for about four years now, and for most of that time I've considered myself genderfluid. Deep down, the entire time, I've pretty much viewed it as bargaining with myself. The idea is that I'll never be a ""real woman"" so the next best thing is to be a ""part-time woman"". The more I think about this, this thing that I've buried so deep in my psyche, I realize that I'm probably just a woman. But I don't know how to feel okay about that. I am very accepting and supportive of other people, but with myself it's just different. I'm very superficial with myself. I feel like since I'm fat, deep-voiced, and hairy, I will never be even half decent as a woman. My first question is this, for those who have felt the feelings I am feeling or are familiar with this sort of situation, how do you improve it?

Also, even if I do go full in on the female thing, I feel a lot of hesitation when it comes to hormones and surgery. Now, I know you don't need these things to be a female, but I feel like if I do embrace this I would want to feel more physically feminine. But at the same time, I'm very afraid of the side-effects of hormones, mostly the heart disease/weight gain part because I'm already heavy and I don't think I could handle it if I got any heavier.

The more I think about this, this thing that I\'ve buried so deep in my psyche, I realize that I\'m probably just a woman. But I don\'t know how to feel okay about that. I am very accepting and supportive of other people, but with myself it\'s just different. I\'m very superficial with myself. I feel like since I\'m fat, deep-voiced, and hairy, I will never be even half decent as a woman. My first question is this, for those who have felt the feelings I am feeling or are familiar with this sort of situation, how do you improve it?\n\nAlso, even if I do go full in on the female thing, I feel a lot of hesitation when it comes to hormones and surgery. Now, I know you don\'t need these things to be a female, but I feel like if I do embrace this I would want to feel more physically feminine. But at the same time, I\'m very afraid of the side-effects of hormones, mostly the heart disease/weight gain part because I\'m already heavy and I don\'t think I could handle it if I got any heavier.

2019-09-25 19:40:27,d98eiv,4,9,"I'm going to start off by apologizing if this triggers anyone, and for writing what I'm sure will be a novel size post by the time I finish. But I guess it's just time to get it off my chest.

With that being said, let's dive in.

I'm 25, currently publicly identifying as a cis bisexual female, although I do have a handful of people who are aware that I've been questioning my gender over the last year. 

I started questioning my gender just over a year ago, prior to that I had never once even considered the fact that I was unhappy with my gender. I knew I liked girls, I knew I felt more comfortable hanging out with the boys, but I never really thought about *being* one. In fact, I wore make up and dressed rather feminine right up until I was 23. 

I remember when I was younger, having a fascination with the girls I spent time with, I loved watching them do cartwheels and get giddy over the cutest boys, I never really understood why though because I wasn't like them that way, I didn't really care how cute the boys were... I just wanted to catch snakes and salamanders, and play with worms and snails.. I definitely spent more time with the tomboys than I did with the girly girls... But all the same, I was in dance classes.. (although, I don't particularly remember *ENJOYING* them... I just really loved my instructor.)

I was never great at sports. I hated gym. I loved the spice girls (although, if I'm being honest, I think that had more to do with having a crush on them than it did with wanting to be like them.) I never hated wearing feminine clothes or anything, not that I remember anyways. I mean I remember my mother dressing me in this god awful velvet dress one Easter but I hated it because it was itchy and the sleeves were too tight... I didn't really care that it was a dress. I mean I wore a lot of track pants and t-shirts but that was more my parents decision than mine, I didn't care what I wore as long as I could be out playing.

Flash forward a few years, I remember always being sort of curious about other girls and wondering if they had the same... Um.. undercarriage?.. as what I did. It wasn't like this obsessive thing, it was just kind of a curiosity I guess. I couldn't understand why men could stand to pee, and could literally pee ANYWHERE... and I had to sit down, and sometime fall in, a toilet bowl just to pee. It didn't make sense. 

Another few years pass, at this point I've got a brother, my dad starts moulding him into a proper little boy, takes him in the Jeep, takes him fishing, tapping, wants to take him on his first hunting trip.... My brother hated all of it. He hates hunting, hates sports (unless it's wrestling) he just didn't want any part of it. Me on the other hand, I begged. I wanted to go be in the blind! I wanted my first deer, I wanted him to see that I could shoot just as good as any old boy and could do better! I got out in the blind once. Never seen a single deer. He never took me again. That's the first time I really remember feeling hurt that I was a girl, because being a girl meant dad didn't want me in the woods.

Life stayed pretty normal though, I started dating boys when I was 14.. my best friend wanted me to date her boyfriends twin brother, so I did, y'know, young... Niave.. lol.. it was the worst decision I had made, have made. He was my first brush with abuse. Physical, mental, emotional, sexual.. you name it. He broke me. But, I decided a lot of our issues stemmed from the fact that I... Was a lesbian. I started dating women when I was 16. 8 years later, I had stayed with women, 5 of the 8 being with one amazing woman.. and that brings us up to date.. or well.. almost.

My fiance and I split up in the summer of 2017. I was devastated, but decided it was a new lease on life for me to do whatever the hell I wanted and not have to worry about how it effected anyone in my life.. all of my decisions were run past her when we were together.. so for the first time in years, I had no one to run things by. It was just do, or don't do. 

I cut my hair and bough my first pair of men's jeans. I had always been jealous of the Butch style lesbians because they seemed like they had it so easy... It was minimal upkeep to almost always look amazing. They were always comfortable, and still managed to look good. So, I cut off my hair and started dressing more masculine, but it was strictly for comfort. 

What I didn't take into account was how I would feel the first time I got called ""young man"". My heart stopped, and then pounded so fast it was like a snare drum pressed against my ear. It came up into my throat, and then immediately, sank to the pit of my stomach. Excitement turned to dread in 3 seconds flat. Lesbians do *not* get excited over being misgendered. At best, they are indifferent towards it.. right?.. 

So I knew something was off. And started to question if maybe I was something other than cis. I mean, I've always envied a good beard, strong muscles.. I've envied a man for his body more times than I can count but not to the extent that I felt discomfort in my own.. until.. I started questioning. Then it hit me like a sack of bricks. Dysphoria went from 0-100 real quick. And then it's like I slammed the brakes. I couldn't be trans. I can't be trans. I'm not trans. Because being trans, means coming out.. again. Only this time, it's not who I love but who I am. This time, it's not my sexuality, it's my identity. It's who the world has known me as for 25 years, gone. My family would never accept that. I mean, I can barely consider accepting it myself... I know them.. they wouldn't be able to handle that.

Next thing you know I'm wearing make up, over sexualizing myself, and for the first time in a decade... I threw myself at men. I needed to know that men found me sexually and physically attractive EVEN if I had short hair. I went off on a bender... Craving the affection and affirmation of men that I was a good enough woman.. that I was exemplary even. 

And now.. now I have no idea who I am, or what I'm doing, where I'm going.. all I know is I'm lost, I'm in pain, and I feel like I don't fit. No matter where I turn, no matter what I do.. I just, don't fit.

If you've made it this far and haven't given up on my tirade at this point, thank you. Thank you for listening to me throw a fit. Thank you for giving me the time to just get it out. I appreciate it. 

I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of posting this... I guess I just needed to get it out. Let my chest be a little less heavy for a moment.

2019-09-26 00:05:00,d9bqxq,4,1,"Hey guys, first time in this thread so bare with me please. 

I'm 21, and I thought I have been genderfluid. I identified as a man for more than two years and I was even on testosterone for maybe for maybe two years on and off. 

Last year, about to be be two years now. I was sexually assaulted at a mental health facility by a nurse. I am not going into details because I can't re traumatized myself, I hope that's okay. She r**** me while telling me to be a cute girl again over and over while doing, yeah... When I left the facility I told everyone that I wasn't a guy anymore, got off T and just suffered.. 

I got back on to T for six months after one point but I just started remembering the incident and it hurt too much so I got off again. I hated it. I want to be on it so bad, I was happy when I got things like a little amount of facial hair and a deep voice. 

I was so conflicted I told everyone I was genderfluid because of how much I was flip flopping. I do like wearing dresses but it feels like cross dressing or cosplay to me. It isn't necessarily me but I like to dress up and just, I really really hope people understand. I am not saying dresses aren't for women but I am saying how I feel when they are on me. I see my best friend who is a trans man in dresses and skirts and I just, I want that for myself too. 

Hell, even when I got a hysterectomy for an unrelated medical issue a few months ago I was so happy. Even though I didn't have cycles in the first place it still felt amazing. I even tell everyone how I'm still going to get a double mastectomy because how I hate my chest. I wear my binder to seem masculine and I want to wear it all them time. 

I am rambling, but my point is that.. this absolutely scares me. I don't know what to do. I am not a place in my life where I can tell my family where I am a guy for sure. I am scared to tell my therapist tomorrow! If I even can!!

I told my girlfriend and best friend after I move out I'm getting a name change without telling my parents or family knowing at the same time as my girlfriend. I want to get my gender marker changed too because that F kills me and even the thought of an X kills me. 

What am I going to do, how am I supposed to tell everyone, how do I explain please I don't know what to do and I'm just scared. I hate that trauma has messed with me so bad that I can't get this figured out anymore. How do I even tell my girlfriend? I don't know what to do if she reads this before anyone else does..

1) how did you transition at work? Was it super awkward.

2019-09-27 19:19:49,da55j4,2,2,"This may sound presumptuous since I can't read his mind, but I think my (AMAB) partner may be trans and in denial. At the very least he's gender non-conforming but feels worried about expressing it. Being a trans person myself, I pretty much know gender euphoria when I see it (and I believe I've seen it in him). Also he's told me how much he wants to wear feminine clothing and ""look pretty"", and seems to have a strong desire to be ""mistaken"" for a woman by the people around him.

There are a lot more details contributing to my belief that he might be trans - basically many different experiences that have all added up over time. I would prefer not to describe everything excessively though since it would take all day, but just know that I have thought about this in great depth, and this issue has been ongoing for a long time.

It seems like my partner personally doesn't believe he's trans because he doesn't have full on body dysphoria. In my experience he does seem incredibly uncomfortable with his body hair, and tries extremely hard to hide it whenever he does dress femininely. Regardless of whether that's dysphoria though, I am a believer in the premise that people can be trans without dysphoria, and also that social dysphoria and gender euphoria are real things.

Mostly my struggle right now is that I want to encourage him to be himself, but not push the issue and cause him to retreat more into his shell. Mostly that ends up with us not talking about it at all, though, and I feel like I'm not doing enough. On top of that, I've been dealing with this uncertainty about him for about three years now, and selfishly I kind of want to just KNOW so I can react according to reality and not just speculation.

Does anyone have advice about what I should do? I try my best to make him feel loved in general, but should I be doing more? To use an analogy, I know that when it comes to baby birds hatching, you shouldn't force their shells open, you just have to wait. But the current uncertainty and not addressing the ""elephant in the room"" just... kind of sucks.

(P.S. I would prefer not to argue about the needing/not needing dysphoria issue in the comments - I know it's a divisive topic but as a trans person I've long since made up my mind on the topic.)

So I came out as trans about 4 years ago, and since then have been binding, packing and have kept my hair in a male style (I go to a barbers so it looks more manly), but I don't know if I'm actually ftm or not. I recently moved from a small island called Jersey in the English Channel to the UK, and started going to an all boys school that started going coed last year, and I'm in stealth there. I like hearing myself being referred to as a guy, with he/him pronouns and my sister calling me her brother and all that, but the main thing that bugs me is my name. 

I chose the name my parents would have given me if I was born male, but I don't know if it fits me. I know I don't like my dead name, wether being referred to by it or just generally hearing it (which is difficult coz it's a very common girl's name), but I don't know wether I feel 100% happy with my current name. I like wearing some femanine clothing like skirts over jeans or this shirt I got which is sheer but covered with velvet flowers, and I like my hair a little on the longer side even though the fringe doesn't reach part my nose at its longest. Sometimes I feel ok-ish with my chest, but I can't live without my packer, and to me my face shape looks too round but I like my high voice. I'm very musical and artistic and have never really been into the stereotypical 'manly' things. I currently identify as gay (man loving man btw) but have been mistook for a butch lesbian many times. I love BTS, Harry Potter and Marvel, and my main hobby is writing books.

I guess my main fear is that I'm not manly enough to be a trans guy, and I'm scared that even though I want to go on testosterone, I'll end up regretting it. And I don't want to be one of those people who thinks they're trans when they aren't and they were just going through a phase.

1) I'm pre T and want to start it, but I'm oddly scared of needles now. Like doing heroin was fine. But now that I've taken a step back I have such a negative connotation with needles! I know theres a gel but I believe the dose it lower. I also know you dont mainline hormones, which actually feels scarier. Like if your not shooting a vein where does it go? Does it just bubble under your skin??? That sounds weird and uncomfertable.


2) even if needles weren't your thing, I feel like life in sobriety is what helped me realize this truth. Like the thoughts been there for years. Sometimes I knew I was getting high, and acting so hyper feminine just to prove I'm a valid female.  But now that im sober I feel so much more comfortable Male presenting.

I'm a 6'1"" male that lost \~200 pounds about 7-8 years ago. I met with a surgeon this week to discuss excess skin removal.

The doctor is great. He specializes in weight-loss patients and has been doing it for 20 years. His pictures look amazing and the facility is great.

Good outcome: she respects me and calls me my preferred pronouns while we aren't around other people and she let's me look more like a boy when it comes to my hair/clothing while NOT telling my dad about my gender until I'm ready. 

Neutral outcome: she doesn't hate me but she doesn't support me either. 50/50 chance of her telling Dad.

The point of this post is not to offend anyone, but to maybe help someone realise that they don't need to transition, if you've already transitioned this post is probably not for you and I'd advise you not to read it.

TL;DR: LSD made me feel comfortable in my body for the first time ever, cancelling my belief that I was transgender.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always felt uncomfortable in my body and I never really felt like I connected with people of my own gender, this peaked in my late teens and I started thinking it was due to me being trans. The signs were there from the early unconsciousness of childhood. I had had dolls and ponies and I remember being confused when my mom wouldn't get me a bathing suit instead of swimming trunks, I also had long hair. I never though that these were strange things for a boy to like, I just liked them.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately (or fortunately as it would turn out) I put these pieces together after my puberty ended and I was already fully grown with very male features. There was no way I could transition and pass, let alone even have the courage to tell anyone that I felt this way. I was convinced I should have been a woman, but I did nothing. For almost a decade I lingered in this limbo like state, due to my situation I felt like life had nothing to offer, I got dealt a shitty hand and I was just passing the time waiting until I was so miserable that I would have to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mid 20s I got interested in drugs thanks to an ecstacy experience, I was blown away that one could have such a radically different experience of the world and I started doing research on other drugs. LSD was my next adventure, with basically a nonexistent harm and addiction profile it seemed like a no brainer to try it, and it saved my life.

&amp;#x200B;

LSD blew away any preconceived notions I had regarding my own identity. All the thoughts, ideas, and stories I told myself of who I were just vanished. For the first time in my life I felt comfortable in my body, not only that but for the first time I felt like I was my body. My body was no longer some abstract thing that I owned and had opinions about, it simply was me and whatever wants and wishes I had for it were irrelevant to reality; it was male therefore I was male.

&amp;#x200B;

I started thinking about why I thought I was transgender and I wasn't that big of a mystery now that I felt comfortable in my body. 

1. I had grown up with a single mom and very little contact with adult males, leaving me with only a female role model to emulate. 
2. I was extremely averse to any physical activity and exercise, we only really get to know our bodies through our use of them, just sitting around playing computer games all day long is a sure way to feel like an alien in ones own body. 
3. Transgenderism for me was a very escapist utopian idea. ""Me and my life is shitty and it must be because I'm in the wrong body, if only I could be my chosen gender then everything would be a paradise""

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't just slip into male existence at once, but now a couple of years after this initial LSD experience (and many, many additional ones) I feel very happy in my body and it almost seems like a mystery how I could ever have felt transgender.

2019-09-29 21:07:29,db19ax,0,2,"Hello everyone, I hope you have a grate day/night. This won't be a quick one as I think I need to cover a lot of ground.


I am trans FtM [17], It's still hard to accept that I am. I have a problem, I always think I fake things. Like depression or anxiety and of course being trans, I always fear am faking it and that's why I stay in the quite to myself and try to make myself think otherwise. But now I am more ready to accept it then ever.


As a child I was always drawn to boyish thing's, would deny the girl things before I even knew that they were for girls. My parents put it off as me being boyish and that I got it cos I grew with two older brother's. And would say me hanging out with other boys' ment me being around potential partners. My dress style didint change much as I grew, I was drawn to more and more masculine stuff, I started to buy my own clothes and my mother would take my opinion into consideration. Would take brothers stuff. So my closet ended up being only guy clothes. My mother always put it off as me having a phase I will grow out of.


I want to come out to my family, but it would be dificult since they wouldn't even understand what ""transgender"" means. My mother has views that are hard to change and always tought that trans people are just people dressing as other gender, and found it disgusting. She suspected that I am gay, and that's why I am more masculine. And said that if I were, she would accept that. But I am very not certain about transgender. She said she would love me in any shape or form. But the issue is- my mother always wanted a daughter. My two brothers were born first and she was dissapointed that she did not get a daughter. When she got the news that she is pregnant again, she hoped it would be a daughter, but the doctors said it will be a son. She was dissapointed. My father imeadiatly said to do abortion, since he did not want a third son, but it was to late. She talked to me like I was a boy for 9 months, until I was born as female. She was happy and excited, her dreams have come true. She always wanted to braid my hair, dress me up into pretty dresses. But since young age I would deny her the pleasure. She grew more and more dissapointed in me and would show the dissapointed quite often. She started to become in denayal, saying that it's just a phase. I don't want to dissapoint her even more. 


My friend, who is trans as well, he and me have this big plan of leaving to another country where he can transition. I did not come out to him, and was in denayal when he was coming out to me. As I said am still scared that I am faking it and that he will lose respect for me if he questions me and think's I am fake. My friend decided to cut of ties with family, since they are toxic, but said he would allow communication if they want to communicate. I am not certain about doing the same. As my mother would simply not understand what does it me that I am a male. And just simply cutting her off would make her think that I hate her and that she failled as a mother or that I don't need her. I wouldn't be able to live with this guilt. And I did not even think what my father would think, would he accept me. Did not think about my two brothers or my grandmother. 


I don't know what to do. I just simply wish I was born as a male, removing every detail of my life and me being known as female. Even if it fucked my life over even more, even if my father would love me less cos I wasn't his first princess. I don't know what should I do with mother, what should I do with my friend who is trans. Maybe I should live my life suffering, just to not hurt the other's. Please help. 

I will appreciate any opionin and suggestion. I am having a turmoil for the longest time.

I am trans FtM [17], It's still hard to accept that I am. I have a problem, I always think I fake things. Like depression or anxiety and of course being trans, I always fear am faking it and that's why I stay in the quite to myself and try to make myself think otherwise. But now I am more ready to accept it then ever.


As a child I was always drawn to boyish thing's, would deny the girl things before I even knew that they were for girls. My parents put it off as me being boyish and that I got it cos I grew with two older brother's. And would say me hanging out with other boys' ment me being around potential partners. My dress style didint change much as I grew, I was drawn to more and more masculine stuff, I started to buy my own clothes and my mother would take my opinion into consideration. Would take brothers stuff. So my closet ended up being only guy clothes. My mother always put it off as me having a phase I will grow out of.


I want to come out to my family, but it would be dificult since they wouldn't even understand what ""transgender"" means. My mother has views that are hard to change and always tought that trans people are just people dressing as other gender, and found it disgusting. She suspected that I am gay, and that's why I am more masculine. And said that if I were, she would accept that. But I am very not certain about transgender. She said she would love me in any shape or form. But the issue is- my mother always wanted a daughter. My two brothers were born first and she was dissapointed that she did not get a daughter. When she got the news that she is pregnant again, she hoped it would be a daughter, but the doctors said it will be a son. She was dissapointed. My father imeadiatly said to do abortion, since he did not want a third son, but it was to late. She talked to me like I was a boy for 9 months, until I was born as female. She was happy and excited, her dreams have come true. She always wanted to braid my hair, dress me up into pretty dresses. But since young age I would deny her the pleasure. She grew more and more dissapointed in me and would show the dissapointed quite often. She started to become in denayal, saying that it's just a phase. I don't want to dissapoint her even more. 


My friend, who is trans as well, he and me have this big plan of leaving to another country where he can transition. I did not come out to him, and was in denayal when he was coming out to me. As I said am still scared that I am faking it and that he will lose respect for me if he questions me and think's I am fake. My friend decided to cut of ties with family, since they are toxic, but said he would allow communication if they want to communicate. I am not certain about doing the same. As my mother would simply not understand what does it me that I am a male. And just simply cutting her off would make her think that I hate her and that she failled as a mother or that I don't need her. I wouldn't be able to live with this guilt. And I did not even think what my father would think, would he accept me. Did not think about my two brothers or my grandmother. 


I don't know what to do. I just simply wish I was born as a male, removing every detail of my life and me being known as female. Even if it fucked my life over even more, even if my father would love me less cos I wasn't his first princess. I don't know what should I do with mother, what should I do with my friend who is trans. Maybe I should live my life suffering, just to not hurt the other's. Please help. 

I will appreciate any opionin and suggestion. I am having a turmoil for the longest time.

I have also never acted like a girl. I liked cars, dressed in male clothes, liked Star Wars, etc. 
I have no attraction to dolls or handbags and dresses. 

I don’t feel any dysphoria for any part of my body. I don’t hate my body, but I like a female one a lot more.

Or is it just that I’m straight and like girls, but somehow my view has been twisted to want to be one.

Is this just because I’ve recently started using reddit and have discovered a new part of the internet? Is it because of how LGBT people are finally rising up and I subconsciously want to join the bandwagon? Is it influences from the internet? 

I don’t know.

2019-09-30 15:18:48,dbd2yq,5,2,"Hi. I’m 18 years old and I’m questioning mtf. I’ve had on and off thoughts about transitioning for the last couple of years, and ever since I was 4 I’ve had thoughts about wanting to be a girl. I remember even pretending to be at a doctors and having my male parts removed and tucking them between my legs and pretending I was a girl. As soon as I found out what being transgender is, I’ve been intrigued by it and haven’t been able to stop thinking that I’m trans since. The want to be a girl is pretty much constantly on my mind. I came out to my girlfriend a few months ago and she was supportive but I also came out to my mum and although she supported me, I got the feeling that she didn’t believe me and I felt very guilty and awkward. Because of this, I shut my feelings away all summer but they eventually came back. I decided to book a therapy session with a gender therapist but the day before I cancelled because I was too scared that I was making the wrong decision and that I’d be wasting my money. 

The reasons that I think it could be a fetish is that I get excited by the thought of transition or whenever I put on girls clothes. I’ve been told this is probably because of gender euphoria and I do get that but I’m not sure. Also, whenever I masturbate these feelings go away for a short while and I feel really guilty again and think to myself that I could’ve made a big mistake and that I’m just going to be a boy from now on. However, my strong desire to be a girl always comes back. 

Maybe I’m just stuck in denial because I’m too scared about what could happen if I did come out e.g. losing friends, being made fun of etc. I just don’t know what to do because I’m stuck in this loop of wanting to be a girl, worrying it’s a fetish, pushing it out of my mind and then all over again. 

Sorry if this doesn’t make much sense I’ve typed this out really quickly and just tried to get all my thoughts down. Any help would be really appreciated :)

2019-09-30 17:10:09,dbeq1g,29,0,"Howdy folks.
This is my first ever Reddit post, so go easy on me.

I decided to create this post to and try see if there are other Trans, or even LGBT people like myself — in a world that’s dominated by, what I like to call, the “crazy LGBT side” — who don’t want to be affiliated with the “community” because of how inane they are.

I am a 22 year old FTM trans man, and I’ve been transitioning since I was about 3 years old. I consider myself a “trans OG”

Anyways, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed — as everyone else probably has as well — that the “community” has turned into nothing but overly aggressive “MTF” (i put quotations because I’m honestly convinced most of the MTF community are just fetishizing being trans.) and non binary people spouting hate.

Examples being: Hating almost every “cis straight male”, hating police officers/military, promoting anarchist behavior, and all of this other ridiculous shit.

It actually makes me want to vomit with rage, especially how these kinds of people get their panties in a bunch over “not being respected”, but their entire lives seem to be on a mission of disrespecting EVERYONE that isn’t MTF, FTM or “non binary”

I'm hoping this type of post is welcome here, but if not, please let me know and of course I can delete :) 

Also, wasn't sure if I needed to put a trigger warning for this subject as I know it can be very uncomfortable. 

I'm a cisgender woman, and recently I've become good friends with a trans/genderqueer person. I have never actually met anyone before who isn't cis. When we first met, I wasn't really sure of their pronouns, so I stuck to using they/them when talking with them. HOWEVER, stupidly, when I first saw them, I assumed they were a girl - I know, this is ignorant of me and something that I'm really trying to work on - so when I was messaging another friend about them (before I spoke to them) I sent messages like ""she's really cute"" and ""I'm afraid to talk to her"". This is absolutely my bad. 

After I became friends with them and heard them talk, I just asked their pronouns as it seemed like the best thing to do and seemed like they would be comfortable with me asking. They were happy I asked, and told me their pronouns were they/them or he/him. I updated my friends and family, whom I had spoke to about them, just in case they ever met.

Then I made a mistake. I was talking to them about the texts I sent to my other friend, where I had used she/her, and I accidentally said this outloud. I panicked, said a quick ""I'm so sorry"" and continued with the conversation. 

So, I'm hoping I can get some advice from people who have been misgendered before - what should I do? Should I just not mention this and obviously NEVER misgender them again, or should I bring it up again and apologise properly? Or something else?

So, right now, I’m a male; born and raised. But, I’m starting to not really want to be. It’s mainly about gender roles. Everyone expects me to be attracted to women, want to be super buff, and I’m not supposed to like “feminine” things like cats or having long hair. Recently, I’ve been fantasizing about being a girl. Most of my interests and hobbies would be more “accepted” if I were female. Idk I guess I’m tired of guys getting uncomfortable whenever they find out I’m gay and people thinking I’m weird by being feminine. If I were a girl, things would be “normal.”

Anyway, the main problem is that I don’t think I have dysphoria. My existence isn’t pain, and I don’t hate myself. I see a lot of people describing gender dysphoria as hell on earth or a fate worse than death. I can go on living as a guy, but I feel like my life would be very different and probably better if I were a girl. What should I do?
