**TW: thoughts of suicide, gross big ball of dysphoria**

So I'm very much in the closet but out to people who i trust/think will accept me.

I went with a friend of mine to a new years thing with a buncha queer people, in the house of a trans guy, and like only my friend knows im trans. So i kinda was like if it comes to it imma come out idc if they know, also cmon its a trans guys house they're all accepting of trans people and don't judge right? 

I was feeling pretty femme and adorable too.

So we go there and we play board games and listen to music and shit and one of the girls is like ""you look like Tom Holland"" and i got really really uncomfortable and said, yo, that makes me uncomfortable, and she's like nonono he's super cool and handsome, and I said well i don't like being compared to men and she totally ignored that.

Then someone called me cis and i was like im totally not cis, again, everyone totally ignored that. Trans guy started calling me a man and said we're the only men in this room, and i was like please don't say that.

Then girl compared me again to tom holland and i was like please, don't compare me to men, and tyey totally ignored that.

And then i made a remark that im totally not straight and they assumed i was a gay man even though i said right afterwards that i get crushes on every girl that's taller than me. 

And i got compared to tom holland for a third time and i again said I'm really really uncomfortable with being compared to men, everyone totally ignored that

And like at some point i realised that nobody is really listening to what im saying at all and there's no reason to even be here cuz i whatever i do/say is totally ignored, plus I'm perceived as a man and nothing i say makes a difference anyway and i probably look super man and gross, I felt as if these femme vibes i saw the last few days in the mirror were just me deluding myself that i look like something i am not. I went to the bathroom and saw a manly man staring back, when a few hours ago i had seen a really androgynous girl looking person. i just went to bed and cried for half an hour. 

I felt super ignored invalidated and like everyone sees me as a man, the femme feel i had got replaced by hyper intense dysphoria and it was absolutely terrible.

I felt like absolute dysphoric shit and thought about suicide this morning too, but I'm better now.


But likeeee how does one deal with this? Like i could have just yelled out yo bitches im a fucking trans woman but with every shit comment and every ignore i trusted them less and less and got less and less comfortable coming out to them. 

Plus like people I'm out to say i look feminine and like a woman but obviously that's a lie since nobody even thought i could be not a man even when i told them, yo I'm not cis at all.

Frankly, she is gorgeous and of amazing potential, cute, beautiful, kinky at times. I absolutely adore her personality, her looks.

The problem I face is that he is a low self esteem, gay community in where I am
From dislike trans (most Grindr users dislike them, gay clubs etc...).

So I thought of a club where trans go and get clients and get laid by customers who adore them and she is frankly loving it.

Last time, she was overhyped about going on a Friday and it turned out to be closed and I for the first time saw her crying.

These surgeries mean everything to me in terms of ridding me of this dysphoria and crippling anxiety and fear I experience every day. 

It would mean the world to me having the users of Reddit for support during this. 

If you can't donate that OK! But sharing my campaign alone spreads awareness and physically makes a huge difference in my life.

Peak of that when I slowly cracked all my fear and my protective shell to be brave another to confront you and let you saw me slowing changing on my transition to be ""exactly who I am"" as a ""woman"", as a girl, as a female you found yourself shocked and I know especially when in year by year, my appearance became clearer and clearer enough to make you notice at least my changing in dramatically way and there's no chance to deny the way I know I'm now representing about all your miserable as parents who failed to raise a kid to grow up to be just normal like other kids with their match on their sex or gender.

I'm not going to talk about how your expectations got me destroyed by labeling as a stupid kid who disappointed you guys not having a good GPA for years just because I didn't want to bring my homework to do with you because afraid for how you guys always turned to be aggressive on how I didn't understand the match or how I can't write ABC and that's how I spent 6 grades in trashy rank of competition I knew I never win and I knew you thought I was the big fail and the mistake you ever had and disappointed you.

But as I remembered many times when I did all chore clear and clean and forced to be real life Cinderella since 6 who did all house work like I was your maid or slave while you guys just sat there, digging all shit about my grade and HOW I DESERVED TO USE MY BODY ON WORKING HARD to replace what I never been excellent like studying. But I remembered when I hit the good grade at high school with A+ and B+ but never ever receive any compliments from you and how did you appreciate me, especially you father, you told me many lies about you'll give me the prize ""of trying"" but I never saw it's coming. And I hope you know why I did have trusting issues when I'm 27 now.

I know I'm 27 now and I never called you on the phone daily and I never come home in every 2 times a month and sorry that I never gave you any money as you expect and want me to do it as a GRATEFULLY CHILD, of course because you think you made me. You think you created me. But like if I have a chance to say that I never want to be owned by you, I didnt want to be born to live this miserable unworthy life and feeling like garbage living in this world.

At least, I know in your eyes I'm still a male child to you where you both even try to understand how hard I'm living my life as a transgender woman who has a real woman stuck inside this ugly body. And has to fight against hatred people give me the whole to just ask me could I just die? because I am different.

Even how I got discriminated by people not to give me any job even I never committed any crime or even I have skills and abilities and my patience to work and improve but I ended up rejected and wasted my time. And now you both said the same about ""JUST MAN UP, PRETENDING TO BE MAN AND WORK"" at least in that casino where you'll be a boy and serve, why? ""because we thought you have ability""

I said ""mom, my ability is better and far away then just that casino""

But that shows me now do you guys think of me especially when you never know I'm suffering of living my life under shadow.

I never want you again in my life,
I better have no families.

**Question:**

Is there a way for someone, who is in particular into that in-between part, to find someone, without being disrespectful to them? I don't feel comfy bothering someone who is trying to change to become themselves to stay in that middle ground, because I like it the most. Are there some people out there who stick to that middle ground to?

**TL;DR** 

I'm into Femboys and similar male androgynous types and don't desire to be disrespectful towards those meeting that requirements (MtF) but are actually up to a further journey. How to find the right ones and handle the ones I don't suit to properly

**Background:**

**About me:**&gt;!I'm a guy, and as my profile may show I got some tendencies to femboyish or other types rather than guys or girls. In the game second life, that I discovered 5 years ago when I was 18, I never had played as a guy. At first as a girl, then (that's the ingame title of that gender/role, not my invention) shemale, and since a few years now as femboy. I love everything about it. The whole subculture, that is pretty deep and rich. But its a game on the internet rather than the real life. And there is not really able to go for that. I'm tall AF, quite, but not extremely masculine and more, so going for that look is something I keep in that place rather than take it out. !&lt;

&gt;!I have been toying with the idea to find a SO that meets my preference of being androgynous or similar. I know it's not that easy since in the most part, cross-dressing and stuff still sadly something most people rather not show off too public (at least according to those I talked to in person. They keep it in safer environments, but that makes it hard to spot them if you don't frequent those), and looking for someone that is trans from MtF for example would most likely not enjoy to be reduced on the status quo and move on to fulfill their goal of finishing the transformation, as far as I can tell. !&lt;

**Problem:**&gt;!Running into someone in the wild was always a quite rare occasion, so the by pure luck method is kinda hard to pull off. Looking out in particular for some type would require some knowledge, how to properly handle the topic. The community in SL is pretty raw and bloody honest about stuff and quite upfront, but I can't really say that for my RW experiences. The few people I met so far tended to be rather shy about the topic and it took a while to even learn about it.!&lt;

**Naive Bonus Question:** 

Are there places to meet such people more likely or is it normally distributed among the typical places people who search to go and meet, such as general bars 'n stuff?

2019-01-04 04:17:11,acecpt,7,1,"I made a lowkey dysphoric post almost a year ago and got memed on egg_irl for it, and ever since then I’ve been thinking more and more about the idea of transitioning. I think I have some very real reasons not to pursue it though. I really just want whoever is listening to let me know if these reasons are just bullshit or if I’m making some sense 

1: I definitely don’t fit into the common narrative. From the trans people I’ve spoken to to what I’ve read online it seems that most of the time the experience is “I knew I wasn’t *Assigned gender*, and I was never going to be able to be mentally healthy without transitioning.” I don’t really feel that way. I would definitely much rather be a girl than a guy, but being a guy is not making me seriously miserable. It’s more of a bummer in my life, a minor inconvenience, than something that is making me profoundly unhappy. 

2: My family would absolutely not be supportive.  I’m not close to my father, mother, or stepmother anyway, and my grandmother (my only adult family member I’m really close to) would support me anyway. What worries me isn’t that though, it’s that I would almost surely be cut out of my much younger sibling’s lives (for reference, my sister is 9, my brother 4, and I’m 17). I’m also relying on my parents to pay for college. My career and education are definitely my biggest priorities (more on that in #3). It’s very likely my parents would stop paying tuition if I were to come out and start transitioning. 

3: My ultimate career ambition is to be a politician or otherwise work in public policy. The vitriol and hatred that trans people receive is already horrifying, and I couldn’t imagine trying to be a transgender public figure. Not to mention the fact that just now we’re getting the first transgender people in elected office, which is to say that it would make being a politician a hell of a lot harder. I’m not sure I have the mental fortitude for that, and frankly, my career goals are my life goals. I feel, at least right now, that I’d rather be unhappy with my body than fail at my career goals. 

4: I love my girlfriend, and I don’t imagine she’d still be interested if I were to transition. (Not that I’m necessarily blaming her, she’d be supportive just she’s straight) 

5: I’m used to not being happy with my body. I’ve been overweight since elementary school, and I figure if I’ve never taken the simpler efforts to make me more happy with my body (as I’m eating healthy and working out), why would I do something INFINITELY harder (transitioning)? 

6: Being transgender is a huge, identity defying thing. For people that know about it, it’s one of the first and biggest labels assigned to you in their perception. I have other parts of my identity that are more important to me. I don’t feel like my mild desire to be a girl is such a big part of me it should overshadow other aspects of my identity. 

7: Y’know, all the regular societal reasons people don’t transition. (Being worried about using the bathroom and having no legal protection are large barriers)

2019-01-04 07:20:51,acfs7t,0,1,"Back story. My childhood best friend is FTM. We met in middle school. He started T around 2014-2015. Prior to identifying as male, he engaged in sexual activity with cis-males. At this point in time, you could call him bicurious and then bisexual (began experiencing with cis-females) shortly thereafter. After this, it escalated to lesbian. Then dressing like a male and strictly dating cis-females (still identifying as female at this point in time). Next was identifying as male and using male pronouns. Then of course starting T shortly after that.
Due to multiple relocations, my friend has been on and off T. Sometimes for months at a time because of the difficulty obtaining a prescription. We had a discussion about that at one point in time and I expressed my disapproval, but he informed me he believed he was fine because his ""body was auto producing testosterone now."" Obviously, not true. Not to the milligram needed, anyway. Regardless, he soon found a doctor in his town willing to prescribe and the doctor even increased his dose by 0.5MG. Well, due to unforseen circumstances, he had to relocate back to our hometown recently and was seeing his initial T prescriber again. The doctor basically told him that he will not be increasing the dose like the new doctor. End of story. If I remember correctly, he is currently without health insurance at the moment and/or has decided that T is not enough of a priority to spend finances on. During this time, he has cheated on his girlfriend as of 2 weeks ago and is an alcoholic. He is also now romantically involved with a male he met online. I didn't ask if the male was cis-male or not because it did not seem important at the time, but now I wish I had because his behavior is incredibly out of character lately and I think it is attributed to having stopped T and potentially experiencing bouts of dysphoria. The reason I wished I had asked is because, historically, he is attracted to women. Always has been. Just because that person may identify as male, perhaps in my friend's mind they're still female to him? Only he could answer that. I don't know. There are some other things going on behavior-wise in addition to him experiencing normal life stressors such as finances and strains on relationship. I'm not saying there is something unusual about an FTM being in a relationship with another FTM or cis-male, but I was honestly just taken aback by these confessions because I know my friend and all of this is unlike him. Is it possible that now that we're adults, this is just simply the person he has grown into? Or does anyone reading this find any of this concerning based on all the information I gave? I'm just really worried for my best friend's mental health and poor judgment lately and want some input on how I should approach this if you think that would be an appropriate thing to do. I thought the best thing to do would be to come to a trans community for answers just in case anyone here has had a similar experience with being off T or maybe you know someone who has.

- It won’t feel right. Aside from the gender neutrality seen above, a lot of the names just don’t feel right. Honestly I’m scared I’ll never find a name that fits me. Maybe this is linked with the first reason but it’s still hard to choose a good name.

2019-01-05 03:15:18,acq4cm,16,1,"Vent post, warning for internalised transphobia

I (19M) went out with my (mostly cis lesbian) friends tonight to a gay club for the first time. 

I can’t really dance and I don’t drink so clubbing is always weird, particularly because I’m always trying so hard to act masc and not be “caught faking,” but tonight I was... hoping for something, I don’t know what I fucking wanted. I was distracted all night, because wow, *guys kissing, guys dancing* whereas usually I don’t even let myself fucking look at guys when I’m out because I’m trying to act like I am one, so I guess I take advantage of having so many female friends who like to grind on me and try to act like I’m het. But even tonight I caught myself feeling fucking guilty for looking at them because I’m not a *real guy,* right? They didn’t come here for a straight girl to check them out. (I’m not one, I’m not one, I know I’m not but when I got back to my flat and looked in the elevator mirror... I tried so hard when I was heading out- new jacket, even fucking... stole Dad’s good aftershave- but no. No.). 

I just. There were gay guy friends with us too and I don’t know. They can dance and they’re all so fucking tall and I got misgendered so many times. I know I don’t pass, especially when it’s been this many weeks since I’ve braved the barbers, so I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking. It just really hurts. Like physically, I feel it in my fucking throat. I want so badly to be wanted. I feel like I’d give anything for someone, *anyone,* to look at me like I’m worth their time, even for ten minutes. 

No-one has ever liked me- well, two people thought they did- but they were both closeted and they liked the idea of me, because I was already out and open and a safe inbetween where I’m not a real guy so it’s not that gay and I’m just so “confident and comfortable with my identity!” (Hahaha yeah fucking right.) I rejected both on that basis and lo and behold, they confirmed it was transference after they came out and got real boyfriends. 


I’m nineteen and I’ve never held hands with a guy, or been on a date. So it’s probably especially bad to be thinking that I’d take anything from anyone as long as it was based on just *want*, but it’s how I feel. I’m just sick to death of being “the cute soft boi” to my cis friends. I didn’t ask for the big eyes and the long lashes and the extremely snappable wrists and the height that’s the first fucking thing anyone who gets told I’m my father’s son comments on (“I thought you’d be taller!” I get it, you’re an asshole!) 

Sorry, this is stupid and unclear. I just feel like everyone has someone and it hurts. I want to do something stupid, like find someone random to hook up with on the internet just to prove that someone would. I feel like I can’t relate to other trans people because they’re all so proud of it but I just want to be cis so bad. I wouldn’t want to be straight, but I just want to be cis. Both gay and trans is too hard. I’m so lonely and it just fucking aches and there’s no way to fix it, not when lgbt spaces in big lgbt friendly cities make me feel like a fucking outsider too. There’s nowhere for me to go. It’s like getting a fucking glimpse of Eden through the gates. It’s perfect out there, but there’s no fucking ticket for the likes of me. No fucking ticket.

I rejected both on that basis and lo and behold, they confirmed it was transference after they came out and got real boyfriends. \n\n\nI’m nineteen and I’ve never held hands with a guy, or been on a date. So it’s probably especially bad to be thinking that I’d take anything from anyone as long as it was based on just *want*, but it’s how I feel. I’m just sick to death of being “the cute soft boi” to my cis friends. I didn’t ask for the big eyes and the long lashes and the extremely snappable wrists and the height that’s the first fucking thing anyone who gets told I’m my father’s son comments on (“I thought you’d be taller!” I get it, you’re an asshole!) \n\nSorry, this is stupid and unclear. I just feel like everyone has someone and it hurts. I want to do something stupid, like find someone random to hook up with on the internet just to prove that someone would. I feel like I can’t relate to other trans people because they’re all so proud of it but I just want to be cis so bad. I wouldn’t want to be straight, but I just want to be cis. Both gay and trans is too hard. I’m so lonely and it just fucking aches and there’s no way to fix it, not when lgbt spaces in big lgbt friendly cities make me feel like a fucking outsider too. There’s nowhere for me to go. It’s like getting a fucking glimpse of Eden through the gates. It’s perfect out there, but there’s no fucking ticket for the likes of me. No fucking ticket.

When she came out to me it took all of 2 seconds for me to say “ok, that’s cool” or something like that. I knew that nothing would change the experiences that built our friendship, and I am very accepting of people for who they are at the core. I did say that it will take me a little while to get pronouns correct all the time, and that garnered a chuckle. I could tell she was relieved, and nervous at first to tell me. A few weeks prior we were at the movies, and towards the end of our post movie contemplation conversation about the word, science, and our friends/family she had said in not so many words that we were going to have an awkward conversation another time. 

I was able, and excited, to start calling her by her new name as soon as she had picked it out. My wife and I were thrilled for her that day that we got to meet Her! I still get pronouns wrong once in a while, and correct myself right away. After 10+ years of using masculine pronouns, I knew it would take me a little work And apologized ahead of time. 

I’m pretty good now, and only get them wrong when talking about our past exploits. For the most part my friend was referred to by her last name in our group of friends. We had several of us with the same first name, so we all went by our last name. Made things easier. 

So now to my first two questions on this sub. 

1. What is the correct/best way to talk about my friend when I am talking about our past before she transitioned. 

2. Birthdays. Do we celebrate her original birthday or the day we met Her as the celebration.

2019-01-06 05:10:22,ad2m4g,8,1,"I hope this is okay to share here. 

Awhile back, a dear friend of mine - we’ll call her Jen - came out to me as trans. (For clarity: She was born with male parts, but I refer to her here now as female.) Nobody else knew except for my husband and Jen’s spouse. Jen married a woman a few years ago (we’ll call her Anne). Anne did not take this news well - understandably so. 

Jen and I talked a lot over the following weeks about her worries, her journey to this realization. She asked me questions and I made it very clear to her that I loved her regardless of her name or how she presented. I told her she could be a dinosaur and I’d still love her. Jen experimented with a new name for a bit. We send fun girl memes to each other. I told her that as she was figuring herself out and how she ultimately wanted to proceed, and I told her that even if she decided she didn’t want to transition or maybe wasn’t trans after all, she was free to be whoever she was without judgement from me. 

Jen’s wife discovered that she had shared this all with me and was very angry. She felt I was undermining her and working against her, trying to ruin her marriage. So with Jen’s blessing, I reached out to Anne to say that I loved her too (the four of us were pretty close) and was here for her, and wanted her to know I wasn’t pushing Jen to do anything. That my main goal was to make sure Jen felt loved and not alone. Anne told me to “mind my fucking business” and a few other surprisingly cruel things, demanded I never speak to her again and blocked me on every platform possible. It surprised me, I’ll admit. I expected some misdirected anger but it was more than I anticipated. 

Jen and I continued chatting and remained close as always. She kept saying how thankful she was for me and how I’d helped her to feel like she wasn’t alone. And then suddenly Jen went MIA. It scared me. I feared the worst. Finally she told me she just needed some space and I said okay. We spoke a few more times when Jen initiated and then over the last 6 months I’ve reached out a couple just to let her know I was thinking about her and hoped she was well... She replied a few times, and a few times not at all. 

It’s been a few months and today I send a text. It appears my number has been blocked. 

In a way I’m not totally surprised. But I’m still really sad. A quick perusal of social media shows that Jen and Anne are still together, which I suppose I’m happy for, and Jen appears to still present as male. No  judgement or anything there.

But I’m really heartbroken. Jen and I were friends for nearly a decade. I viewed her like the family you choose. I suspect Anne may have demanded Jen cut us off and that is really sad if so. 

I’m here because I thought you guys might have some more perspective to lend here. I’m trying not to feel heartbroken about this or focus on how unfair this feels to me. It’s not about me. Jen’s the one going through something significant. I suppose I have to just accept it for what it is and move on, but I’m struggling to do so and not feel somewhat bitter. I’m trying to remind myself that it’s not about me, but I’m having a hard time with that.

She replied a few times, and a few times not at all. \n\nIt’s been a few months and today I send a text. It appears my number has been blocked. \n\nIn a way I’m not totally surprised. But I’m still really sad. A quick perusal of social media shows that Jen and Anne are still together, which I suppose I’m happy for, and Jen appears to still present as male. No  judgement or anything there.\n\nBut I’m really heartbroken. Jen and I were friends for nearly a decade. I viewed her like the family you choose. I suspect Anne may have demanded Jen cut us off and that is really sad if so. \n\nI’m here because I thought you guys might have some more perspective to lend here. I’m trying not to feel heartbroken about this or focus on how unfair this feels to me. It’s not about me. Jen’s the one going through something significant. I suppose I have to just accept it for what it is and move on, but I’m struggling to do so and not feel somewhat bitter. I’m trying to remind myself that it’s not about me, but I’m having a hard time with that. \n\nThank you for reading.

I've only ever told one person about this before, and I know that I wouldn't be accepted by my family if I were to tell them about this; it was difficult enough for them to accept that I came out as lesbian last year.

My problems started back in secondary school when I was 15. I would sometimes feel a lot of discomfort in being a girl, it just didn't feel like ""me"". I have to say that these feelings weren't 24/7 - they'd come and go, so I thought that maybe it was a phase and they'd go away eventually. Up until I was 17, these thoughts remained in my head, and I never acted on them. I then began dressing in my dad's clothes in secret, which I still feel a lot of shame about. The feelings had gotten much stronger and this was the only way to make them ease. I then left home and started University, and I still feel the awful confusion that began years ago, but still intermittently, which is the main source of the confusion for me. I never explicitly feel ""like a girl"", I only feel less uncomfortable with it at times. And at other times, like now, it's almost unbearable.

I don't seek answers from Reddit as to whether I am trans or not, I only hope for advice or comfort from others that have struggled through questioning their gender.

I would sometimes feel a lot of discomfort in being a girl, it just didn\'t feel like ""me"". I have to say that these feelings weren\'t 24/7 - they\'d come and go, so I thought that maybe it was a phase and they\'d go away eventually. Up until I was 17, these thoughts remained in my head, and I never acted on them. I then began dressing in my dad\'s clothes in secret, which I still feel a lot of shame about. The feelings had gotten much stronger and this was the only way to make them ease. I then left home and started University, and I still feel the awful confusion that began years ago, but still intermittently, which is the main source of the confusion for me. I never explicitly feel ""like a girl"", I only feel less uncomfortable with it at times. And at other times, like now, it\'s almost unbearable.\n\nI don\'t seek answers from Reddit as to whether I am trans or not, I only hope for advice or comfort from others that have struggled through questioning their gender.

2019-01-07 12:33:44,adh96i,2,1,"So I'm in a crazy, lonely spot right now and I need to get my feelings down. And I need to put them out there and think that maybe someone will read them and understand. I've been lurking on similar subs for a while now (traaaannnnnns, egg\_irl, etc.) but I thought this would be a better place for this jazz. Ignore me if I'm stupid or babbling. I just want to put my shit out there cause I don't know what else to do right now. Anyway, let's get started. I've been wearing women's clothes in secret since I was very young, maybe eight, nine-ish? I was an awkward kid and had trouble expressing myself so I hid the habit, obviously, but the thoughts never went away. Fast forward a few years and I hit puberty (ugh), and discover the wonderful world of internet porn. Somehow, someway, I find myself reading pages and pages of (terrible) erotic fiction about boys my age dressing up as girls. I'm sure some people who read this will guess that I ended up trapped in the whole sissy thing, and they will be right (please don't judge, I feel enough shame as it is). Years pass and I struggle to handle what has developed into a sickening addiction that keeps coming back over and over again no matter how hard I try to stop. But then one day something in me cracks, and I realised this fetish shit is covering up something bigger, pushing it down so I can't get to it. I realised that my real desires were being warped by my porn addiction. I adopted the personal mantra that 'maybe the things I'm ashamed of aren't the things that are wrong with me'. I pledged to embrace and explore my obsession with 'crossdressing', and examine earnestly what it meant to me... if only it were that easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Weeks pass and I'm knee deep in books of all kinds - basically anything related to gender. I feel better-ish but shame and confusion still crop up from time to time, feelings strained by trying to explore all of this while living in a long term relationship. Oh yeah, I should mention that I've also come out about all of this (sans the porn angle) to my de-facto wife at this point in the story. She didn't take it well and while we managed to carry on happily enough the whole thing ended up staying a personal journey. I talked to her about it sparingly sometimes, but she didn't really want to confront it, which made me withdraw. So now I'm dressing up every single time she leaves the house and laughing with glee in front of the mirror like a real silly-billy. This goes on for a few weeks and I begin to get depressed because I can't make sense of it or express it as openly as I'd like. I plunge myself into online games and alcohol and forget about it, developing a smouldering angst as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Life goes on and I'm lurking on the crossdressing sub and I stumble upon a comment linking me to egg\_irl. This is where shit gets blow open for me big time. I devoured everything on that sub, relating to everything all the while. I began taking quizzes, filling out anything and everything that billed itself as a kind of 'trans test'. I couldn't stop. And, I admit, I think I was looking for things that confirmed this burgeoning feeling within me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm signing up to reddit and actually creating content and interacting with people (this is BIG for me; I don't socialise online EVER). I've begun to think I might actually be trans but the thought absolutely terrifies me. And yet I can't stop thinking about being a girl, can't stop combing through my personal history like some kind of mental detective, isolating every little thing that seems to point towards this fact I never even considered until recently. I keep stopping myself from believing its true but at the same time I'm just as scared that it might not be true. Lately I've been asking myself if I could go back in time to my childhood would I choose to live it out as a girl? And I really feel like my answer is yes. My whole sense of self has fallen apart in a few short months and I am so confused. I feel like I'm walking through a haze. I can't focus. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I feel queezy all the time and my heart feels like an empty cavern. And to top it all off I'm trying to figure all of this out while going through a slow and painful separation.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my mum (amazing woman) about seeing a psych the other day. I didn't tell her the real reason why but she just thought it was because of my failing relationship. She's been a social worker for a long time and I trust her to point me in the right direction. Anyway, she hooked me up with a place that I called up a today. I don't know if they're the right place for my situation but I figure that at the very least they'll be able to help me find someone more appropriate. Now I'm on a three week waiting list and I know it's not actually that long a wait; but with the way I feel right now three weeks seems like an eternity. This whole thing feels more real to me than anything else I've ever done in my life and every day feels like more wasted time.

2019-01-07 15:39:29,aditaz,24,1,"I wrote this to someone on r/rant.  (Yes it will no doubt be removed, because you will all spit your dummies out, and report the OP).  All I have to say to that is grow up!  

So, I’m just gonna say what I want to.  And it will not be liked by some.

Gender is a false construct.  It’s purpose is specifically to bring about the destruction of biological sex distinction. So people can do the bloodly hell what they want with their bodies, whatever the consequences for themselves or others, or society. 

It is radically selfish.  

It’s radical individualism.  To the extreme.  It’s a refusal to acknowledge reality and it’s a retreat into an ivory tower of seclusion from reality itself!! 

It’s utterly staggering and profoundly sad.

From the trans ivory tower, a person is totally secure.  Because everybody else is to blame for everything.  Nothing is the persons fault.  They can do no wrong.  These people are mentally ill, often severely mentally ill and have suffered trauma from a young and very young age, that they may not be aware of, but controls every aspect of their lives.  Their suffering is severe.  

But, it’s no excuse for their actions.  

Trans people a victims par excellence.  The manipulation of others is reprehensible.  The damage that this dogma is doing to trans people and potential trans people and society is alarming!!!!! 

So, I’m now going to talk about it from a Christian perspective, which will probably piss a lot of people off, I don’t know.  But the truth hurts, even when it’s spoken in love.  

So, ultimately, trans people are sticking their V’s up to the creator of them.  And in rebellion saying, you made me, I’m going to remake me.  So there.  I want absolutely nothing to do with you God, I hate myself and everything.  And I’m going to lock myself up in this ivory tower and throw away the key.  (What you don’t know is, God can easily get in that tower, people are so stupid) 

It’s radical rebellion.

But their decision, in-fact cuts them off from reality, itself, and any possibility of any help at all to overcome their almost insurmountable inner anguish and turmoil. 

And the truth gets harder now.  Trans people may change their sex in this life.  But they won’t know this.  But every human is an eternal creature.  And when after they die, and God raises them up on that final day.  (Google it, or read revelation, in the bible) 

They will be given new glorified bodies and that body will be the body they were born in.  They will inhabit that body forever in eternity.  (As an adult) In one place or another.  There are only 2 places to go after death.  

And have people read about the founder of modern gender theory.  A man who said paedophilia is ok!  

I’ll post some links.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money

Just read about John Money, and what he did to one boy/man.  And how both brothers committed suicide and the parents blame John Money.  

A theory and a whole framework of belief and understanding about something that isn’t true was set up by this despicable man.  (in my opinion).  And is being propagated and propagandised around the world!

We need to stand up for the truth.  And stamp this awful doctrine of death out.  By telling the truth lovingly to others. 

Because otherwise, your child might be next.  

And I have had a horrendous life, suffered unimaginably.  More so than probably most trans people.  So I know the depth of their suffering. 

But they still need to hear the truth.

And it is possible to recover and even overcome severe early childhood trauma.  But sadly, because it’s staggeringly difficult to overcome.  Lots of people give up.  Throw their hands in the air, look for the easy option, oh I’ll be trans.  And then your lauded by every idiot under the sun.

It’s not societies fault you are trans.  It’s your choice.  

You know why the trans lobby is winning.  Because our education system is so dreadful, generally.  People have lost the ability to think for themselves.  And they are just regurgitating pathetic tropes about inclusion, equality, tolerance, acceptance.  You’ve heard the nonsense.  

Sex change is being encouraged to youngsters all around the western world.

If anyone even mentioned trans to any child of mine in school.  I would have them removed immediately if the school wouldn’t take my concerns seriously and change its policy.   I suggest you do the same to.

Your children’s lives are at stake!  

I would encourage Carl’s family to be loving but firm!  With him.  And if his behaviour continues. I suggest they cut him out of their family.  

These people are destructive and hell bent on destruction.  Whether they know it or not.   (I’m not making the point about them going to hell here, I’m saying this is their attitude in life, to others, it really is) THEY ARE THE HATERS!!!  Of everything!!! And they say others are haters.  Oh the irony.  Wake up people.  

You might as well put an M16 in each trans persons hand and send them into a shopping mall with and endless supply of ammunition.  For all the damage that they are doing to others and society.

This is the stark truth, people.  

(And none of this is abusive!  And if I get banned or blocked from this site for this message, I will take it to the highest level through all the proper channels) 

I am not transphobic.  There is no such thing.  That word was created to demonise, those who often lovingly and despairingly may want to help these people.  And to keep the trans people safely locked up in their ivory towers.

If you want to live in your ivory tower in unreality.  Then go and live there.  And shut up and leave us all alone.   We are completely sick and tired of the utter, staggering ridiculousness of it all.

If you can’t even realise that no one was born in the wrong bloody body.  Then there is absolutely no help for you at all.

Goodbye.  

And I would/will not use pronouns, I will not call you by anything but your biological sex name.  And so should all other people do as I would/will do! 

Go have your pity party somewhere else. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  Get back to reality.  And get help for your mental health issues.  

And the cost to the tax payers for all transgenderism treatment is making everyone else poorer!  🙄

It’s just childishness.  It’s like an adult trying to have a conversation with a very wounded 5yr old.  

Do you trans people know how utterly exhausting it is to even think about you or have a conversation with you.

I had one trans person, purposely message me on here with the intention of starting a fight with me.  Look through the comments, the trans person actually messaged several people and picked fights with them.  

Trying to spread their unreality, hate and harm people. 

I went out of my way to be gracious with said person and they just stonewalled me.

But the truth hurts, even when it’s spoken in love.  \n\nSo, ultimately, trans people are sticking their V’s up to the creator of them.  And in rebellion saying, you made me, I’m going to remake me.  So there.  I want absolutely nothing to do with you God, I hate myself and everything.  And I’m going to lock myself up in this ivory tower and throw away the key.

This is a pretty minor thing, but I have an issue with the terms MTF and FTM. When I read “MTF,” the letter that sticks in my head the strongest is the very first one. M here means the person’s sex pre-transition is male, and since we’re talking about trans people, it means the opposite of their gender. But the acronym makes it a little harder for me to keep track of what they’re actually saying their gender is.

Anyways, today we were doing that, and my Mom tried to call my dad to see if he wanted to talk to me. Dad did not, and it turned into a phone argument between my mom and him.

The reason I'm writing this post is because he claimed that ""nobody is on his side."" Which I found to be strange, I thought everyone in my Dad's family group would be on his side. Most of them are Republican and pretty religious. But either way, a lot of people I thought would be totally against this aren't, actually.

So turns out I'm so unlucky that out of all my family group, the one person who's transgender coincidentally has the dad that is the least trans-supportive. (Like even if I wasnt trans and wanted to wear girly clothes he would say no).

Idk this is a dumb post but it made me think a lot.

2019-01-10 18:10:43,aelo98,14,1,"So about a year and half ago I started dating a girl.  At the time I had just started poking my head out of the closet but I was still not sure where I stood on the gender spectrum.  I was heading more down the path towards MtF but I felt the need to attempt a relationship/sex with a ciswoman because I never had much experience.  I'm also into kink but wasn't sure if I was a dom dude or a sub girl.  So I started talking to this girl and we went on a few dates.  After a couple dates she came over to my place and started having issues that ended up with me needing to take her to the ER.  Nothing major, she just wasn't eating enough and it was causing issues.  She really had a lot of issues which weren't immediately apparent to me.  She grew up with a mom who abused her in many ways and had no support network.  

So then we start dating and less than a week later she tells me that she had a falling out with her roommate and didn't have a place to live (and no where to go since she had a crappy job and no support network).  So of course seeing her in trouble i wanted to help and offer her my place until she could get onto her feet.  Then the next week she lost her job and suddenly I had to support the both of us.  She went 8 months without a job.  Spent a lot of time sleeping all day and watching TV (she said she was applying for jobs but she's so picky).

When I started dating her I thought that she was a sub and into kink but as it turns out (I basically told her), she's actually a little which is not at all what I'm into.  Furthermore I don't think I could be a dom even if I wanted to.

I've tried to break up with her before and it didn't go so well.  She gets panic attacks and starts acting irrational.  She tried to kill herself one time and had to spend 3 days in the mental health clinic.  She started getting some assistance at that point but it didn't make much of a difference for me.  We share almost nothing in common.  She has essentially taken me away from my family and friends, effected my job performance, is fiscally irresponsible with my money, and even worse I'm pretty sure I'm MtF and she's said in the past that she doesn't like Tiffany (my chosen female name) and that she feels threatened by her (and thus I haven't been able to be Tiffany except for once or twice for an hour over this time.  She even knew about this side of me a long time ago because on our second date I showed her a picture of me and told her I'm unsure of what I want.

I don't know 100% why I'm posting this but I guess I want some advice and encouragement on how I can get out of this toxic relationship.  I'm very afraid to confront her at this point as I don't trust her to react rationally.

TLDR:  I've been dating a mentally unstable girl who is a little for the past 1.5 yrs and we have nothing in common and I just want to end it and be able to explore being Tiffany and I'm very scared of ending the relationship because she hasn't reacted rationally to previous attempts to breakup.",trans,I made a horrible mistake and have been living with it for the past year and a half and I don't know how much longer I can take it.,1547169043.0,"{'created_utc': 1547143843, 'id': 'aelo98', 'num_comments': 14, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""So about a year and half ago I started dating a girl.

2019-01-11 13:34:27,aevez6,2,1,"Hey...

today I realized that I can't take it any longer. I have to finally take my life into my own hands. But there are some things preventing me to do so... A little backstory... 

Two years ago I got to the conclusion that I have Gender Dysphoria, that I can't live on the way I am. Always being good with my family I thought they would probably support me, so I asked my dad, who was upstairs at this point, if he could come down to my mother because I would like to tell them something. He didn't want to until I told him what it's about. Still feeling like he would support me as good as he can, I did it but had soon to realize it was my greatest mistake... 

As I told him how I feel about who I really am, how I just can't live on the way I am. He said nothing at first, didn't flip out or anything. He did something far worse. He put the greatest emotional pressure onto me, telling me about how he fears to be sick, though he didn't want to tell me what it is, however he made clear that he needs me the way I am to get through this. He basically told me „You'll kill me when you do this“. I just couldn't, just couldn't anymore, I locked myself in my room and started crying. He knows I love him, that I would never want to hurt him and he drops something like this at the moment I'm most vulnerable? Telling me how he could be dying? Basically hitting me with both fists directly to the face I just couldn't understand the world anymore. He said he needs me the way I am, the thing is that this is NOT who I am, that was the whole point behind our conversation... 

But I couldn't just couldn't. Despite how hard it was, how I felt about me, my body and my life, my future, I couldn't bring myself to be so egoistic to risk someones life because I put myself over them. 

It's actually funny when I think about it out loud, how I've basically been told that I would kill him by doing that but it's the only way to stop whats slowly getting me more and more sick and not far from killing me... He basically does what I can't. I don't know how he feels though and hearing he may be sick is extremely hard to bear as he told nobody except me at this one point. But how can he even think that I can endure this when he tells me something like this in a moment like that? How can he think I wouldn't be there for him in the time of need? Does he even think that? I have no idea... 

I couldn't continue and even though it hurt I also couldn't flee and do this on my own, he needs me, he said it himself, so continuing to be what he wanted me to be he stayed supportive in any other matter now only occassionally throwing in passive agressive „My SON“'s. Everytime it hurt more... 

He has been such a great father, supporting me everywhere he can but this? Why does he do this? I always thought him a great man, was I really so wrong? I knew I couldn't keep this play up for long and today is the day I finally want to end it. I can't look into the mirror without disgust anymore, everyday I feel like throwing up and crying and screaming, I can't dream of something else anymore, if I sleep at all. I pushed everyone I could call a friend away from me. It's basically all or nothing for me now... 

I have no doubts I can do this alone, be happy again and find new people to be around, but the fear gets the better of me. The fear of what might happen to my father, I still love him so much despite what he is doing to me, I can't be so egoistic and end up risking his life. The fear of what happens to my family, what if I break it apart by doing that? My brother is so short of finishing his school, this would ruin him. At this point I have the feeling my life doesn't belong to me anymore. 

I have no idea how to get out of this, what I'm supposed to do or if I even CAN do something about it. I can't take all of this any longer... I want to flee, I want to end this play, but I can't just can't. But what should I do?

2019-01-12 07:26:40,af568x,1,1,"Alright so I'm an 18 y/o trans girl in southern United States and I've been friends with a group of people in this Discord server (a trans Twitter friend owns it and it contains a bunch of her friends) since around May 2018. I've started talking more intimately with one of the other trans girls in the group, she's 21 and currently resides in Denmark.

We added each other on Snapchat and talk regularly, this goes on for a few months. Then she admits to me that she has feelings for me, then later asks if I think we could ever be ""more than friends"". After this she suggested we watch Netflix together while in a Discord call. We do this every day now. She's made further hints at being interested in a relationship with me, first starting with playing ""36 questions"" which is a set of questions which I found out after a quick Google search is mostly meant for couples. Then earlier tonight, she sent me a screenshot of a message that a mutual friend of ours sent her, where they said they think we'd make an ""ideal couple""

Now I'm not sure where I should go from here. Normally in an IRL situation I'd be like ""hell yeah sign me up, let's go on a date"" but this is different. Here's a few issues I have...

She hasn't seen much of me, just a few very carefully selected pictures that look particularly nice. (I've seen plenty of her, I know she's adorable)

I'm not particularly attractive right now, HOWEVER, I'm (probably) only going to look better with time. I'm losing weight quickly and I start HRT in a few months, after that I'll be getting laser hair removal and doing some other things that are going to make me look a lot nicer

She's far away. I can handle a long distance relationship for a little bit, but I want to be in a situation where we can be together/near by as soon as possible.

Now here's another thing, I can't really imagine there being a much better time than now (or soon) to pop the question. So... Does that mean I should just say fuck it and do it? I'm super confused.

So i've wanted to be a female ever since I was a kid. When I say that, I mean I had a DEEP desire as a very small child to be a girl. So deep that I actually came out to my parents when I was 7 or 8 years old. That took a ton of courage because my parents are country folks (they are wonderful parents, but...) it took a TON of courage to do so. They didn't really know how to handle it, so I just said ""i'm kidding"" to de-escalate the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see, the thing is that I thought it would pass. I was very mature thinking for a kid, and I decided to just keep the feeling to myself and bide the time. Eventually it would dissipate, right? WRONG. Here I am at 24 and It has not only gotten stronger, it is starting to affect me negatively. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want you guys to get the wrong impression, I am Texas strong and I work very hard and go to college. I'm not one to get slowed down by emotional tolls. But this (I guess Gender Dysphoria) is so strong now that it is slowing me down and hurting me both mentally and physically. It's almost like grieving. It doesn't make any sense. I have tried and done everything to ignore and get over it, but it comes back stronger and stronger.   


Finally, and I speak for myself and myself ONLY. I don't want to transition fully. The reason why is because I wanted to be biologically female. I wanted to bear children and breast feed, and grow up as a female. But I can never and will never have those experiences. So I feel like me wearing women's clothing and ""transitioning fully"" would only deepen the void. (like I said, this is me speaking for me, and how I feel about MY feelings.)

I am so excited that a play centering on trans live  has been chosen for the VAULT Festival programme, but it also feels  alienating as the only play on the bill about trans people.

VAULT  Festival are currently running a competition with Stagedoor in which  the most liked/saved plays on the app will be given a lot of marketing  help, help that we couldn't afford otherwise, and help that would  transform whether people came to see the show or didn't realise it even  happened.

If it is possible, it would  mean the world if you could download the Stagedoor app and search 'Dead  Reckoning' (the name of the play) and save it to your events. That's all  that is needed - you dont have to commit to anything except saving the  event, and it would help get the only trans play on the programme seen  by others. I think theatre is still lagging behind with trans  representation, and we hope just by being at a festival like VAULT we  can play a small role in disrupting that.

First of all, my surgery will be on Thursday (Jan 17th) with Dr. Eric Bensimon.
Today’s a weird day. Remember as a child being so excited for a family trip the night before? So magical yet so frustrating. You just can’t believe how amazing tomorrow will be. That’s how I’m feeling. I’ve been waiting for this for so so long! Today I’ve been staring at my face in the mirror on and off. I swear a demon will appear in it soon! Also, I’ve been patting myself on the shoulder for finally reaching the finish line. I’ve always been thinking as myself as a sperm (weirddddd Allie!). It makes sense we’ve been in horrible situations to ensure our transition and survival and it seems like I’ve reached the egg and have to just wait a little for my body to fully form and burst outta that womb! 
I’ve already got my plane tickets for me and my bf from Toronto to Montreal. Planning on getting back with a train (I’m an anxiety gal and I’m not about to be walking around with a beaten up face in an airport!) I’ve been contacted by Brigitte from the doctor’s office to get everything done. Now, there’s a language barrier since she primarily speaks English but we got the work done and I’ve done a surgery before and know how to prepare for it. But if you live in Canada, I recommend making sure one of your French speaking relatives are available! (Every Canadian has one I’m sure of it haha). I think you can ask to speak to someone who’s very fluent in English. I didn’t bother to ask. But she has been very kind, patient, and helpful. 
I’ve decided to Airbnb my time there and they’re relatively like super cheap! Hotels in Montreal aren’t that expensive either. Make sure you book a place around the surgery centre not the actual office! It’ll save you money on Uber if you’re not driving. 
I’m getting my a complete forehead reconstruction and a rhinoplasty. My face is already semi feminine and I’ve always been out with makeup and people always gender me right (also don’t forget, Canadians are very nice people haha). But I’m really hoping for FFS to help me to get out of my home with a lot less anxiety and makeup! Also, FFS will not get rid of your dysphoria entirely. You might still look at the mirror and see a boy. But generally I think that because your brain picks up on your hard tissues as a way of facial recognition, FFS and directly altering the bone structure will help a lot. Also, hormones happen gradually but FFS is literally overnight. So, if you’re getting FFS be a lot excited for it! But still not a magic pill. The greatest help is from within. So if you have or are gonna get it and still aren’t happy with your results, there’s a chance that you might need to get some psychotherapy (also, sometimes nature is crueler to some of us and some doctors might not give us what we want). But, I assure you what you think is masculine or feminine is a lot less noticeable by others. 
Overall, I just wanted to give you a lil backstory before I get on the plane tomorrow. I’ll definitely be writing more tomorrow night!

Planning on getting back with a train (I’m an anxiety gal and I’m not about to be walking around with a beaten up face in an airport!) I’ve been contacted by Brigitte from the doctor’s office to get everything done. Now, there’s a language barrier since she primarily speaks English but we got the work done and I’ve done a surgery before and know how to prepare for it. But if you live in Canada, I recommend making sure one of your French speaking relatives are available! (Every Canadian has one I’m sure of it haha). I think you can ask to speak to someone who’s very fluent in English. I didn’t bother to ask. But she has been very kind, patient, and helpful. \nI’ve decided to Airbnb my time there and they’re relatively like super cheap! Hotels in Montreal aren’t that expensive either. Make sure you book a place around the surgery centre not the actual office! It’ll save you money on Uber if you’re not driving. \nI’m getting my a complete forehead reconstruction and a rhinoplasty. My face is already semi feminine and I’ve always been out with makeup and people always gender me right (also don’t forget, Canadians are very nice people haha). But I’m really hoping for FFS to help me to get out of my home with a lot less anxiety and makeup! Also, FFS will not get rid of your dysphoria entirely. You might still look at the mirror and see a boy. But generally I think that because your brain picks up on your hard tissues as a way of facial recognition, FFS and directly altering the bone structure will help a lot. Also, hormones happen gradually but FFS is literally overnight. So, if you’re getting FFS be a lot excited for it! But still not a magic pill. The greatest help is from within. So if you have or are gonna get it and still aren’t happy with your results, there’s a chance that you might need to get some psychotherapy (also, sometimes nature is crueler to some of us and some doctors might not give us what we want). But, I assure you what you think is masculine or feminine is a lot less noticeable by others. \nOverall, I just wanted to give you a lil backstory before I get on the plane tomorrow. I’ll definitely be writing more tomorrow night! Talk to y’all later!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My FFS experience :)', 'created': 1547593437.0}"

My parents forced me to come out after finding some feminine objects I had in my room like clothes. To sum it all up, it went horribly and left me in ruins.

I’m a very dissociative person in general but I don’t know how to stop it anymore.

I don't know if that makes any sense. Just little things here and there that felt 'off' -- she was a bit too obsessed with ""boys do this and girls do that"" and would come home from preschool in tears be wise she was doing ""stuff boys aren't supposed to do"" and spent some time trying really hard to only do things boys did. 

So, we're driving home from school and she drops ""I'm a girl"" on me like we're discussing the weather. I didn't want to say the wrong thing, so I asked some questions like 'How long have you felt like this' and stuff, she's felt like this as long as she can remember. Feels out of place in her clothes and in her body. She never really seemed to care too much about what she wore, her dad got her mostly like sports shorts and t-shirts, but recently ish I tried to help her find her 'style' since she was starting kindergarten. Turns out, she hates all the 'boy' style clothes I had picked out. 

Me and my boyfriend took her to the store and she picked out two cute dresses -- there were a few she chose initially that were just too short and we had to say no, which kind of hurt her feelings -- and then I offered to help her do her makeup or style her hair. She's not really interested in makeup, which I told her was okay, and she wants to grow her hair out to braid it.


I'm just -- I don't know what to do. I want to do the right thing, I just can't even imagine what that is. I'm being as supportive as I can, it's just as someone who is and has always been cisgendered, I can't even imagine what her needs might be right now. I looked up information on ""your child has expressed they may be transgender, now what?"" and it's all been very catered to post-puberty age groups, or like 10-12 years old.

It's all very much been just ""I'm not comfortable in my body"" with my baby. 


I did some reading about how most people knew from a very young age what they were inside and how they felt it didn't match their anatomy, which I can't even begin to try to comprehend how difficult that must be, so I don't know what words to use to support my baby through this.

My first conscious memory is of being at a friend's birthday party and wanting to examine her barbie doll. It wasn't anything sexual (I was 3), I was curious and the packaging looked neat. Someone at the party swatted my hand away and told me that the toy was for girls.

Ever since then I have experienced this dull, tearing, omnipresent pain in my soul. It's comparable to what I imagine it feels like when a surgeon leaves a utensil inside of your body.

It felt like a demon, and I did what you are supposed to do with demons, you seal them. In my late teens, the demon had grown too powerful... I was dying.

It was then that I realized that floral colors suited me. That alleviated just enough of my suffering to seal the demon away again and it returned to being that dull, tearing pain.

9 years ago I got married. My wife always found it interesting because she has never really been attracted to men before. I wasn't the first man she felt attracted to but she'd never really experienced ""passion"" toward a penis-haver.

Telling me this put a crack in the seal. It wasn't an emergency, I patched it up and was good to go.

4 years ago she realized that I wasn't an anomaly. She realized that she wasn't attracted to me in spite of me being a man. She was attracted to me because I **wasn't** a man.

As time went on, the now imperfect seal started to degrade further and further. Early this past December I admitted to my therapist that I experienced gender dysphoria.

This is how the seal shattered.

Ever since then the pain has gotten worse and worse. My sex drive has basically self-annihilated, I can't bring myself to leave the house, the more I think about it the worse it gets and I can't stop myself from thinking about it.

I don't know what to do. I'm in too much pain to do anything. I'm afraid of taking any steps forward but going back feels like suicide. I want to do all of these things but it's so big I can't figure out where to start.

when i look at my thighs with clothes, or when i have to wear tight clothes (with a binder, so you can sort of still see my chest), i cringe. so i guess if this is dysphoria, it’s mostly in relation to social situations, and how others perceive me.

I have one trans amigo I talked with about this but my intuition has been bugging me to ask someone else. I got reminded of a discord server called ""Transpeak"" and I wanted to ask for someone to hear me out there but I'm so anxious I just couldn't join the server. I don't want to give details as I don't want more people to hear my experience. All I will say for now is how I always was indifferent towards my male gender and how I actually feel pretty darn positive towards the female one.

  I probably am not trans though. I have no dysphoria. My emotions have been numb for a long time and I don't really understand myself well now. When I first flipped the switch for good I felt really euphoric for 1.5 days which is something extreme for my current emotional level.

Gender and transgender identities are not legitimate. Gender is nothing other than a dangerous and oppressive social construct.

* makes me personally uncomfortable,
* has increased divisiveness in our world, 
* has provided fuel for the violent backlash against the left,

2019-01-20 09:42:03,ahw3xd,0,1,"I apologize in advance for the lenght:

I started having Gender Dysphoria, when I was in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend about 3 1/2 years ago. Before that I was already very insecure about myself - not that fundamental - but regarding my sexuality. 

In the relationship I noticed that sex mostly is more work than pleasure and started having strong sexual fantasies about a friend of hers, who would always hit on me. I carried that around with me for a few month until I decided that it was killing me and im going to break up with her. Shortly before the breakup I startet having these thoughts that it might go deeper than just what gender(s) I'm attracted to.

At this point I was already severly depressed, because I cancelled my psychology study and had no point of orientation. Also I felt very guilty for breaking her wolrd, since she was very dependant on me and showed strong reactions. I started having panic attacks, when driving and felt all around miserable. I talked about this with my mum, but she couldn't really offer any help. She was not fully antagonizing me, but was surely not believing. Hence my parents pressured me to start something new, although I was in shambles.

Idiot that I was I started a study of mechanical engineering. I was not in a good place to start with, hence it was difficult for me to find a flat and so I had to sleep at different airbnbs for a few month until I got a place at the university dorms. Somewhere I knew, I wasn't really there to study, but to flew from my old home town situation. That's why I didn't apply for state support ( Germany ) and only had some savings left and the 300 € CP my mother sent me. That was not enough to live so I had some financial problems. I got more and more suicidal. I was scared that I would really reach the point of self harm, so I went to a psychiatry, where I stayed 2 month, but didn't talk about the gender dysphoria until my last theraphy session. I mentioned it and broke down and cried. The psychiatrist just said ""we might be on to something"", but since it was the last session I was just released without further help. After that I hung around at the university dorms until I decided it doesn't make any sense no more and applied for social care. I found a nice single flat and with some exceptions dwelled in it for several years until I reached the point where I told myself, it's not going to get better. You have to find a job. Money is not going to erase your problems but make them far more bearable until you know what you want.

I was not very confident in my skills, so I applied for an apprenticeship as a dietician in a different city, where I already had some friends. The outlook of having somewhat of a future, friends I could meet more often and fleeing that old flat, that I dwelled in, gave me a giant boost of energy. 

Well turns out my friends aren't really helpful with that problem either and the field of dietetics is somewhat interesting, but the apprenticeship is more for people who have less life experience. Also there are a lot of women in my course and I get constantly reminded that I am a man in a woman's job ( fucking flat heads ). 

So here I stand: I'm not really auto aggressive anymore, I stopped looking for the reason I have so little success in life in myself, but still don't really know what I want in regards to my identity. Can't apply for state support anymore, so studying is out of question, am 24, growing bald, have little moments of joy and insomnia without medication. 

Many TS I met are kinda sexist, so I'm still not sure wether I just want to match a picture but this time the female and not the male one or if this really makes me happy. I'm too much of a coward to try going out as cross dresser first. Besides people will see me as a cross dresser and not as my intended gender. Money would make this far easier, because I would be able to afford a taxi/ own car, clothes and make-up. No idea how to get that though. Not sure either what I wanted to tell you with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you got some ideas for a good paying job I can apply to or learn with a fucked up cv like mine. I thought about programming as you can teach it to yourself with little financial effort in about a year, but I find it rather dull and boring.

2019-01-21 22:28:36,aifu7m,0,1,"Hey. So, this might be a weird one, but I’ve got to vent, and this is probably the best place to go. 

I’m so tired of this online culture so many of us have. It’s like we look for any excuse, any character flaw, *any* misstep to cancel a person. I see people talk about it with AOC, for instance, as if they’re just waiting for her to say one wrong thing, and then she can just be ‘cancelled’ and it’s all over. 

And I get it. We’ve been betrayed by a lot of people, and a lot have really let us down. But this isn’t a way to live. Like, it makes me miserable being tangential to it, and I know the people who do that — who feel this way, they *have* to feel miserable. 

Like, I want to like things. I want to enjoy media. I want to like artists. I want to Stan a politician who might not be perfect but who’s a breath of fresh air and gives me hope. I wanna do those things without being afraid that this big fringe group is gonna leap on me, and lecture me on how problematic so many things are.

She invited me to her apartment to drink a glass of wine, with the expectations some friends might join later. Nobody ended up coming.

We had a great conversation, where, throughout, she casually indicated that she was lately pursuing relationships with other queer/trans women. She also noted that she wished she would be able to flow more in that moment as she was feeling my flirty attitude. It wasn't tense at all, I wasn't expecting anything to happen that night beyond meeting a cool local artist.

But wine flowed, and at one point she sat in the sofa and said something that I understood as 'I just want that person to sit here with me and make out.' I approached, sat, and leaned in to kiss. Big no no. She was taken a back and demanded to know why I did that if she had not clearly indicated clearly that she wanted me to do so. She is right of course, I didn't read the situation right and looking back saw the trail of comments that, had I been more observant, would have told me to stay clear (I have been abroad for 10+ years, and we were communicating in our mother language). I also think that her comment in the sofa was in relation to a specific person she mentioned earlier in the night versus any person. I misunderstood ""That \[person\]"".

I tried to apologize and she told me she would not feel sorry for me. We left her place and we parted ways. 

Appreciate any advice on how to approach the situation, but do want to be able to communicate my apology with the hopes of keeping communication open. Our home country has been experiencing high levels of violence against women - particularly trans women - so I want to be extra careful as I imagine that this could've been seen as a serious breach of trust after she invited me to come drink wine.

Thank you all.

2019-01-23 17:36:47,aj26lm,20,1,"Let me start by saying I am not very educated on this topic, so my apologies in advance! 

I recently married an amazing man with 3 absolutely perfect children! His youngest daughter is 8 years old. When she was around 2 years old she asked her parents to stop calling her a boy because “I am a girl”. 

I just want to say- she is so freaking adorable! The absolute highlight of my life! She is the epitome of a girly girl! She has bright pink hair, loves to dress up, is OBSESSED with unicorns, she is the sweetest kid anyone could ever meet! I adore her (and her siblings, let’s not forget about them!). 

Last night my husband and I were discussing our concerns for her future. Right now she goes to school in a small town and everyone there knows and loves her. Here are some of our questions and worries:


1) What will happen in a few years when all the other girls go through puberty? How can we support her through that time? 

2) When is the appropriate age/time to begin hormone blockers or HRT? And what should we expect once that begins? 

3) Would it be appropriate to set her up with a therapist and if so, is it to early to start that now? (We want her to have as much support as possible)

4) What about dating!? I know she’s quite a ways off from this, but we all know how cruel kids can be! She hasn’t shown any interest in either sex as of yet (while my son, who’s only a year younger, has already had “girlfriends”). What is the best way to support her through that time? 

Currently, we pretty much let her direct us. She tells us what she likes and wants and how she feels and we encourage her to just be herself. But right now she’s so young, so it’s all pretty easy. 

What are some good resources for us as her parents? Are there any books we should read? 

I want all the best things for all 5 of our children, as any parent would. What can we do to help guide and support her and be the best parents we can be?

People who could have been like me that are younger have their own experiences. I cannot yet believe that I truly am a woman, though I have felt it every day of my life. Depending on the family, there are children now who are embraced as soon as they can express themselves.

It's beautiful, yet alien to me. Ten years ago the support groups I attended in a liberal bastion in the Midwest were all tears. Strangers in safe spaces would treat me as a rare bird. ""I don't know what to make of you,"" was a common refrain. 

Now the groups are love and laughter. Nobody has to apologize for coming out. We have terms for our foes and their tactics, and allies no longer fear for their own lives simply because they expressed our right to exist. For the first time I can *talk* to therapists and doctors and stylists without having to spend 20 minutes of my paid time giving them a tutorial in basic rights.

I love this new world, but the leader of my country is not of this new world. I can't turn off the news because it affects everyone I love, but without that surface level of jerks using us as a scapegoat to rile up the stupids life would be more than tolerable for us.

The dysphoria is monstrous, but now that I've embraced myself it's my Navi, my annoying little guiding light telling me where I need to go to advance the plot of my life. The truly wretched parts of my life aren't mine now, it's the fear of dumb hicks who listen to the radio drunk and horngry rather than getting therapy. 

The parts of my world that I have control over are fine and getting finer, but we cannot tolerate these institutions that perpetuate hate for a buck any longer.

I was born cis, and I consider myself lucky to have had other women around to help me learn how to do makeup and develop my own personal style while I was growing up, but I recognize that a lot of trans women may not have had that kind of guidance or support from others in their family. That upsets me, because although I dont feel anyone needs to wear makeup or be traditionally feminine to be a woman, I believe everyone should have an opportunity to learn and at least have some help and support available from close friends and family. So if you want help, or have any questions about anything, just DM me. No pressure though. I enjoy the conversation and it would be even better if I could use my skills to help someone be more confident in their body."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'If you need any help with makeup, I can help', 'created': 1548363417.0}"

2019-01-24 22:10:00,ajhwru,2,1,"Hi everyone! 

I was hoping I could get some help on gender inclusive language for a women's professional group. Basically at my workplace we have a group to promote women in the workplace. It's open to all genders and even some men join, but our mission statement just says women since we are only focusing on women's issues. Some are concerned that if we expand on that it will lose sight on the fact that it's about women's issues so I need to craft some language that makes it really simple. There is a pride group that is equal to the women's grout that is actually made for promoting queer and gender folks on the workplace, so this group is specifically for folks identifying as women. Otherwise I would just say something like ""women and gender non-conforming individuals."" But GNC doesn't mean woman identified so that's more like erasing their whole imagine. 

The sentence in essentially: ""To create opportunities for women to thrive"" 

So I graduated college fairly recently and in college we used ""womxn."" Is that still a thing?

Or should we say ""To create opportunities for women (cisgender and trans women) to thrive"" 

Or should we say something else? 


Clearly I'm just talking myself in circles here. I tried Google and it got me no where helpful. Any help appreciated here! Also, it's worth noting we don't actually have any one in the office who is openly transgendered. This language is more to set the mindset for cis-women. 

Thank you!

2019-01-25 22:44:42,ajuovi,2,1,"So I was reading through a Reddit comment thread the other day and saw one of those all too common, ""being trans is a mental illness!"" Comments. Now I should mention at this point that I actually have a mental illness, (Pure O OCD) 
Contrary to what many people think, OCD can be a miserable condition, and also manifests itself in many unpleasant ways, outside what is often portrayed in media.
So where am I headed here? Well when I read this comment about trans people being mentally ill I had the thought, ""so what?"" It really shouldn't matter if being trans is a form of mental illness or not, in general I believe people don't have a firm enough understanding of mental illness in mainstream culture. It's often seen as being a bad thing, only criminals and creeps are mentally ill. 
The reality is that having a mental illness shouldn't be seen as being indicative of having a bad nature, and if being trans is a mental illness then y'all have something I don't, and that's a cure! Many mental illnesses, including pure O, don't have cures, you just have to deal with it, therapy, anxiety/depression meds, etc. and you just hope that as you get older your symptoms might fade. If I could have a surgery, and take some hormones to make my pure O go away, that would be great!
I guess what I'm trying to get at is that, ""Being Trans is a mental illness"" is something that trans phobes have latched onto as an argument for why trans people are bad, when the truth is that it's a non issue, something being a mental illness doesn't necessarily make it evil, nor does it mean that the person afflicted with said mental illness is a bad person, it just means that there is something different in how their brain works.

But i usually did it for purely sexual reasons; not necessarily to be a woman, but I got off on the fact that I looked hot in girls clothes. I loved the way I looked as a girl sexually and wanted others to see me as a sex object, but I would rarely go in public. As a teenager, I dated girls and enjoyed having sex with them for the most part. I love the female body and really enjoyed having female sex partners, which is confusing because I really want to be the girl when I'm having sex, but I still would pursue females because I wasn't sexually attracted to men physically, just mentally in my fantasies. I would always fantasize about a man having sex with me as a woman, or a woman having sex with me as a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm getting at is, my trans feelings are tied up in my sexuality and not necessarily in my wanting to live my life as a woman. I'm worried that I'm only having these feelings because I want to experience sex as woman, not because I want to live a life as a woman.

To summarize, I live life as a man and have sex with a woman most of the time, but I fantasize sexually about being a girl and having sex as a girl. I have gone through crossdressing periods where I have gone out as a woman and really enjoyed it, but purely from a sexual point of view. I liked thinking that other people were viewing me as a sex object and a woman. I go through phases in my life where I really embracing the crossdressing and buy beautiful clothes, and then I feel shame and throw them all away. I've done this for 25 years on and off and i'm now in a crossdressing phase and I want to just embrace it fully, but I'm worried that maybe I'm only doing it to get off, not to actually be a woman for real. All day I dream about having breasts and a pretty face, but is that just so I can feel sexy or do I really want to be a woman? Also, I have a wife who knows about my crossdressing but is totally opposed to any of it including even roleplaying in the bedroom. She is not supportive at all and actively discourages any of my crossdressing sexual urges in bed so I have to hide everything from her which makes me feel more shame and guilt.

Me and S have always been close despite only seeing each other at big family parties. About a year ago he said he needed to talk to me and told me he was a boy. S asked me to refer to him as female in front of the family till he figured out what to do. We talked about it for a while and he said he wasn't sure if telling his parents was a good idea and in light of more recent events I see why. 

He ended up telling them shortly after and they were super unhappy with him. They dead name him, rag on him, go out of their way to mention their 'daughter', etc. It really hurts him. He told them he was having major mental health issues and they told him that he was also making that up. His girlfriend of 3ish years also broke up with him and trash talks him at school. 

All of this is especially infuriating because S's father's brother killed himself because of mental illness a few years ago. So you'd think S's parents might take that a little more seriously. 

Christmas was hard for him I think. We have a very large family and everyone found out, not by S's choice. His parents were doing the whole 'our lovely daughter' bit. A lot of people were using the wrong pronouns and shit. Our elderly grandpa said something along the lines of 'hes obviously better as a boy than a girl', one of our aunts agreed and after that people sort of dropped it until after dinner. I made sure to use his name and he him pronouns and I corrected his sister once and she was like yeah whatever.

I texted him after and was basically like rough night huh? I text him every other week or so to check in and a lot of the times he just says yep parents still suck, yup still depressed. I encouraged him to maybe seek counseling through school since his parents are being so weird about that but hes too depressed or afraid. I understand that feeling. I told him I started counseling and it really helped me but I don't wanna push too hard because another point of stress seems like the last thing he needs.

2019-01-31 10:51:33,alobpb,5,1,"So, as a kid (age 6-10) I vividly remember telling my parents every now and then I wanted to be a girl. I dressed up in dresses all the time at home, my friends were all girls and I was into all the girly stuff and hated the boyish stuff (we're talking about the 90's here so those things were pretty much playing with dolls as opposed to soccer. Still hate the latter by the way!). As I remember it, I basically was a girl except for exterior appearances. My parents never thought much of it but still were sweet enough to allow me to dress up like a girl every now and then at home. But surely, puberty hit me in the face and suddenly my attention shifted to totally different things, like trying as hard as possible to be normal. The thoughts of being a girl almost completely faded away and didn't bother me for a long time after that. The only thing I tried every so often was wining a towel around my head and blurrily looking into the mirror to see how long/female hair would suite me. Silly me.  

Until recent years, that is. Every now and then the thought would come up, not thinking much of it. However, in more recent times the thought has been coming up more and more, and I cannot so easily discard it anymore. I even had a conversation about it with my boyfriend, which of course was quite emotional for both of us. The ""conclusion"" from that conversation was that I'm simply not sure enough to do anything with it.

But that answer might simply have been an answer out of fear; it's such a big step, maybe the biggest one one can take in a human lifetime. I've got the utmost respect for people who took the leap, I truly look up to you.

I dressed up in dresses all the time at home, my friends were all girls and I was into all the girly stuff and hated the boyish stuff (we\'re talking about the 90\'s here so those things were pretty much playing with dolls as opposed to soccer. Still hate the latter by the way!). As I remember it, I basically was a girl except for exterior appearances. My parents never thought much of it but still were sweet enough to allow me to dress up like a girl every now and then at home. But surely, puberty hit me in the face and suddenly my attention shifted to totally different things, like trying as hard as possible to be normal. The thoughts of being a girl almost completely faded away and didn\'t bother me for a long time after that.

Though I was still horribly depressed, I felt such a relief that I could finally be ‘me’, something I’d never felt before. I’ve been through sixth form and my new college as a Male and I’ve felt no doubt or problems (apart from obviously dysphoria and passing). 

Now, I recently received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and a T prescription through gender care. I was due to get the shot a couple of weeks ago. On the day I remember i was really excited in the morning, I then saw my therapist and talked it out the nerves etc , and then I went to meet my mum for lunch . When I met her I suddenly felt a gut feeling like it was the wrong thing to go and I think she was feeling that too. It was almost as if I just wanted to run away and scream “NO STOP!” . But , instead , ignoring those feelings I went to the nurses office to get my first shot of T. I had to wait an awfully long time as they’d forgotten to sign me in , so I ended up seeing the nurse 2 hours later than I should’ve and spent that time feeling anxious in the waiting room. Throughout that whole day I swung from being so excited and happy , to so nervous and sad. Eventually I entered into the nurses office and she asked me if I was excited then out of the blue I just burst into tears and I said to her I’m so scared and I keep thinking is this really the right thing for me ? She told me she’s not going to do the injection today as I showed some hesitation and told me to come back when I’m ready - fair enough, I thought. 

I went home and I was full of relief , I was actually happy with relief . I felt like I was happy that I didn’t have the shot . But , I felt awfully confused, I felt like I didn’t know who i was anymore. For the next few days I woke up almost worshipping my female body thinking ‘thank god I didn’t ruin myself’ , ‘thank god ive still got this body - I’m not a man!’ And I almost became anti- trans and told myself that that wasn’t me and I brainwashed myself. It was like I was fine having a female body . So wierd. SO confusing. Anyways, a few more days go by and I end up feeling as I usually do, masculine and wanting T and I was annoyed that I hadn’t had it that day. I became excited again. I rang up the nurse and asked for another appointment next Friday and I was so happy!

However, today I am back to being doubtful and full of anxiety again. I start reading the effects and people’s time lines and my mind starts saying ‘no no no I don’t want this’ , despite wanting it a few days ago. I thought I could just have the first shot that lasts 28 days and if it’s the right thing I’ll know , but I won’t know if I keep waiting. But even then its still freaking me the f*ck out. It’s like half of me wants it half of me doesn’t. But for the last however many years and years of my life I’ve always yearned for the day I start T. It almost feels like I’ve got this female in my mind that creeps out whenever I’m about to get T that doesn’t want the body to change - it’s very strange . 

Before someone asks if I’ve been to therapy, I have . I spoken through my feelings , had a diagnosis of gender dsyphoria from a professional and the NHS, despite telling them of my doubts I have occasionally, they always say I’m an ‘easy case’ , in other words , clearly trans.

So, what I really want to know is if this is normal ? Has anyone else experienced this before , to this extent ? I always thought it would be an easy process.
