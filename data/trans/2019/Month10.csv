2019-10-02 08:57:57,dc7kze,3,5,"This is going to sound like a load of first world whining, but bear with me. 

I stopped having parties when I was thirteen, upon realizing that my extreme comfort came from a nasty dysphoria. I hated being called a girl, gifted makeup and nail polish, asked about boyfriends, etc etc. 

My parents pushed, but ultimately relented when I reminded them how their families viewed queer folk. Fighting them on my sixteenth birthday was hell, but they left me alone even then; I know they’re ashamed of me, and it works to my advantage, here. 

Well. Usually, at least. 

My mom decided, in deference to my recent graduation and upcoming birthday, she was going to hold a party. A huge party, with “a surprise you’re gonna love”, and invite the infamously transphobic side of the family. 

She’s not supportive, not really. I think she tries, sometimes, to use the right name at least. Mostly, she just pretends that it’ll go away if she ignores it hard enough. 

The last big surprise was name brand makeup. The last time I saw this side of the family, I had to hide in the bathroom stall for hours, crying and bleeding because my cousins decided they could beat the sin  out of me. If I see a banner with my deadname on it, I’m going to lose my fucking mind.

A huge party, with “a surprise you’re gonna love”, and invite the infamously transphobic side of the family. \n\nShe’s not supportive, not really. I think she tries, sometimes, to use the right name at least. Mostly, she just pretends that it’ll go away if she ignores it hard enough. \n\nThe last big surprise was name brand makeup.

2019-10-03 20:07:50,dcwcut,8,4,"Hi everyone!

Please let my know if this post is not allowed or disrespectful and I’ll delete my post. My intentions are only good.

I am a screenwriter looking to write a shortfilm about the struggles of a young trans girl in middle school.

I am very passionate about transgender rights and acceptance which is why I want to write this film.

I’m from Denmark and here it’s still a battle to get people to see that sex and gender are two different things. Every once and a while a news article will pop up with parents defending and supporting their trans child and every single time people come after them, saying that it’s unethical to cross-dress a child etc. They simple don’t understand what being a trans person means and that there is a gender and sexuality spectrum to just name a few. And it outrages me as I’m - like I said - very passionate about spreading the understanding and support of all kinds of people, genders and sexualities across my country, if not the world to the best of my abilities. Simply put, I want this film to matter and hopefully make a difference.

So I come to you, humbly asking if you will guide me. Tell me about the struggles you face or have faced throughout your life.

I’m particularly interested in hearing the trial and tribulations of those of you who at an early age discovered that you were trans. How did you find out? How did people and your parents react? Were you accepted or shunned? What’s your life like today?

But all stories are welcomed. I’m sure I can learn a lot from all of you.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I hope to hear from you soon and you are free to DM me if you’d prefer your story to be private.

Have a good day/night.",trans,Screenwriter looking for trans people to help my research.,1570158470.0,"{'created_utc': 1570133270, 'id': 'dcwcut', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 4, 'selftext': 'Hi everyone!\n\nPlease let my know if this post is not allowed or disrespectful and I’ll delete my post.

2019-10-05 07:34:54,ddk3fp,10,7,"I'm sure this question has been asked a million times, but I hope it's okay for me to ask it again anyway. I wanted to add a little personal detail, so here's my story in a sort of brief summary:

I started crossdressing when I was around 12 or so. I don't have any sisters, so all I had available was my mother's clothes. It was around that age when I first started being allowed to be home alone and whenever I was, I'd rush straight to my mom's wardrobe to dress up. I loved those times! Later, when I was around 18, I moved out to live on my own. I didn't have any female clothing, so there wasn't much dressing happening in that period of time.

A few years later still, when I was around 20, I moved in with my girlfriend, who I am still with today. It didn't take long before I started dressing up in her clothes whenever I was home alone. That went on for years, with me dressing up occasionally, when I had the chance. It could be months without dressing, but I always got back to it eventually.

It wasn't until about 5 years ago, when I was 28 or 29 that I finally came out to my girlfriend. There was some rough weeks after that, where she had to think things over, but we stayed together. She just didn't want anything to do with my crossdressing. She accepts that I do it when I'm alone, but she doesn't want to see or know about it. I had been buying some female clothing on my own before coming out to my girlfriend and have bought lots more after coming out, but it's all still hidden behind my male clothes in my wardrobe.

Now, the thing is that it can still be months without me dressing and then there can be months where I want to dress up all the time. Usually it's during the summer that I don't dress up, both because I'm a bit shy of showing myself with shaven legs in shorts as a male, but I've been thinking if it's maybe also because I'm happier during summer? I like summer and enjoy the long, bright days. When autumn comes, I start shaving my body again and dressing up more, so maybe crossdressing is just something to keep my mind happy during the dark days of the year?

On the other hand, when I look at all the beautiful women over at r/transtimelines I can't help but to think: God I wish that was me! I'm sure most here have had thoughts like that, but does that make me trans? Again, it can be months where I hardly think about it, but then at other times, I feel sad and almost depressed (not a word to use lightly, I know) about it. I'm really in such a period now, for sure. I just feel uncomfortable in my own skin and hate the reflection I see in the mirror. Shaving my body helps, as it takes some of the masculinity away somehow, but I still - obviously - see a man in the mirror when I'm naked and that makes me sad.

I've often thought about transitioning, starting hormones and such, but I don't think I'll ever have the courage. Maybe that makes my question pointless, but I'd still like to know how those of you who *did* start transitioning found out that it was the right thing to do. Maybe it's inevitable and the fact that I haven't done it yet is proof enough that I'm not trans? It's also just really rough for me right now, when going through this period where basically all I think of is wanting to be a woman. I just can't help but to think that if it hadn't been for the internet and seeing all these other trans women, I would have never had had these thoughts to begin with? I don't mean any offense to anyone by that, but maybe, if I hadn't know transition was an option, I wouldn't have even thought about it?

2019-10-06 06:38:45,ddzn7o,3,2,"It's 1:16 A.M. I'm tired, sad, and dysphoric.

About 1-2 months ago I came to terms with me being trans. I was on extreme denial. It wasn't until yesterday that I had told anyone about it though. And while I have literally no way to present as femme, I'm happy ive at least acknowledged it. It explains alot in my life.

At the moment I'm 16. I live with my parents, both transphobic, extremely conservative individuals who live in the middle of nowhere in rural, racist country. They don't respect my free will when it comes to my body, and seem to believe that material objects make up for emotional neglect.

I can't go to therapy (when I almost committed suicide they just screamed at me for doing so and proceeded to do nothing else), If I get any grades under their standards I'm just booted away until I fix it, exc you know what the issue is here. 

Well, to test the waters I tried to explain to them about 2 months ago that I'm bisexual. Yeah, didn't go well. Made it for 13 hours with that whole ""We'll always love you"" speech.

The highlights of our fight include: being told I've never been in a ""real"" relationship, being told all my friends are deliquents, that all the LGBT kids at my school should be killed in some way, being told that I'm not old enough to make these decisions, being yelled at for ending things with an outwardly transphobic asshole of a ""friend"", and the whole ""biological grandchildren"" speech garbage.

As well as the constant reminders every week or so of how much it upsets them, but whatever.

Well, now we're here. Obviously I can't say anything until I move out. But here's the issue. For one thing, I don't know any way to get to college short of earning a degree (which is possible) without financial support from my parents. If I do this, obviously I will be disowned, or cut off, exc. And I'm not going to wait any longer. I'm moving out as soon as I'm 18, and I'm going to get myself set up with a doctor. I won't pass up my 10 year puberty window for their stupid fucking ideals.

As well as that, I want to move away. Like, far away. And I don't know if any jobs in my area will accept me as a worker if I'm trans. Everyone is an asshole. So I don't know how the hell I'll get money to do any of this. My job I'm working at now is only minimum wage, and I think all I can get working there is around 30,000 once I'm done with it *if I'm lucky*.

Hell, I don't even know where to go to get hrt, bottom surgey, exc.  And at the moment I'm doing some extreme weight loss in preparation (I weigh alot.) And it's stressing me out. I don't know what to do here..

And while I have literally no way to present as femme, I\'m happy ive at least acknowledged it. It explains alot in my life.\n\nAt the moment I\'m 16. I live with my parents, both transphobic, extremely conservative individuals who live in the middle of nowhere in rural, racist country. They don\'t respect my free will when it comes to my body, and seem to believe that material objects make up for emotional neglect.\n\nI can\'t go to therapy (when I almost committed suicide they just screamed at me for doing so and proceeded to do nothing else), If I get any grades under their standards I\'m just booted away until I fix it, exc you know what the issue is here. \n\nWell, to test the waters I tried to explain to them about 2 months ago that I\'m bisexual. Yeah, didn\'t go well. Made it for 13 hours with that whole ""We\'ll always love you"" speech.\n\nThe highlights of our fight include: being told I\'ve never been in a ""real"" relationship, being told all my friends are deliquents, that all the LGBT kids at my school should be killed in some way, being told that I\'m not old enough to make these decisions, being yelled at for ending things with an outwardly transphobic asshole of a ""friend"", and the whole ""biological grandchildren"" speech garbage.\n\nAs well as the constant reminders every week or so of how much it upsets them, but whatever.\n\nWell, now we\'re here. Obviously I can\'t say anything until I move out. But here\'s the issue. For one thing, I don\'t know any way to get to college short of earning a degree (which is possible) without financial support from my parents. If I do this, obviously I will be disowned, or cut off, exc. And I\'m not going to wait any longer. I\'m moving out as soon as I\'m 18, and I\'m going to get myself set up with a doctor. I won\'t pass up my 10 year puberty window for their stupid fucking ideals.\n\nAs well as that, I want to move away. Like, far away. And I don\'t know if any jobs in my area will accept me as a worker if I\'m trans. Everyone is an asshole. So I don\'t know how the hell I\'ll get money to do any of this. My job I\'m working at now is only minimum wage, and I think all I can get working there is around 30,000 once I\'m done with it *if I\'m lucky*.\n\nHell, I don\'t even know where to go to get hrt, bottom surgey, exc.

I hope that this is the right place to post this.  I saw this film tonight at the BAMPFA in Berkeley, California, and thought it might be of interest to folks here who might want to see it.

For those unfamiliar, Les Blank is a widely known and respected documentary filmmaker for ""Garlic is as Good as Ten Mothers"", Gap-Toothed Women"" and ""The Blues According to Lightin' Hopkins.""

Les' son Harrod has continued his father's work, most notably with the art car documentary ""Wild Wheels.""

Harrod's latest film is a portrait of Rusty Tidenberg, a brilliant car mechanic and professional racer until he came out at 53, getting breast implants and openly wearing women's clothes.

""What Can't I Be Me? Around You"" examines Rusty's struggles to be herself, to be accepted as herself and to ultimately find love.

Screenings are pretty limited, and this wonderful film needs all the attention it can get.

Here is the current schedule:

Oct 11 9:15 pm at Colligan Theater, Santa Cruz Film Festival

Oct 12 at 8:15pm at the Lark Theatre in Larkspur, part of Mill Valley Film Festival

Oct 12 at 4:45pm at the UCSC Communications Bldg., Santa Cruz Film Festival

I don’t know where else to turn at this point. I don’t have options, so hopefully you can help.

I am transitioning in Scotland, we are pretty forward with these things, but I’m also a teacher.

It’s fucking hell. It’s a nightmare, it’s everything I hate about myself. “Hi, I’m Mike. I’ll be teaching your kid, oh my GG tits? Just ignore them please.” 

It doesn’t work, I’ve had to leave the school, I can’t bind, they are too big and it’s agonising. Because I can’t be present in the classroom, I can’t afford my surgery. My mental health has just taken a nose dive.

All I ever wanted was to be a teacher, to support kids and help people achieve what they deserve. It’s an extremely hard job, it’s taken it’s toll on me and now I can’t handle it anymore. 

I’m on the edge Reddit, and I am desperate for advice, for support, for anything. Being a transgender teacher is the hardest thing I’ve ever done, I don’t know who I am without that classroom and I can’t be who I am in it.

I’ve exhausted all my options to fund my surgery, I have to have it before 2020 summer or I can’t renter the classroom.

Anything you can do or say or help me share this so I can finally be who I am suppose to be and get back to doing what I love in education.

They\'ve decreased the amount of messing with me because they\'ve started being afraid of me thinking I might hurt them if they continue ( like school shooting). I don\'t really care if anyone bullies me what so ever but this means I have no chance of being accepted as trans in school as well.

The passage, while not really unsupportive of trans people gave an uncorroborated anecdote about getting banned on /r/ActualLesbians ""for not wanting to fawn over 'girldick.'"" 

Now maybe it's just me, but I've never found this to be true. It gets brought up now and again, but every time someone has asked ""Is it okay to call myself a lesbian if I'm not interested in trans people?"" the consensus was ""Yes, it is!""

Nonetheless, all of a sudden it's a *thing* and I guess I never noticed it was a *thing*. Anyways, now people are getting cheerfully invited to /r/GenderCritical and /r/TrueLesbians.

Like:

&gt; [I was just banned from /r/AL]. I expressed that it is an expression of rape culture for lesbians not to want to date women who have genitals of biological men. I think problematic trans women in the community are forgetting that they were raised as biological men and thus subject to sociological conditioning to feel entitled to women sexually.

In other words:

&gt; I was banned because I think that all these vague and unsubstantiated strawmen think they can do whatever they want to a woman and believe they deserve to be able to rape women and why aren't we doing anything about these people that definitely exist!

There's more genuinely awful shit in this thread that I really shouldn't be reading. What bothers me is that, generally speaking, everyone is agreeing with a pretty reasonable and vague concept. Yes, nobody is expected to date me for any reason, even if they're attracted to women. But it's the attachment of all these pro-lgbt communities and strawmen that make it out like there's some sort of oppressive ""rape culture"" in the LGBT community that is kind of freaking me out.

For example, when it first happened for me, I started to feel as if there was something wrong with me around the sixth grade, however there were obviously signs of it before then. I preferred friends of the opposite sex, didn't want to play games or sports that were considered 'masculine' or mostly associated with boys, a lot of times I had dreams or fantasies about suddenly changing and becoming a girl, and around the time that puberty was in full swing, I cracked and realized I wasn't comfortable as a boy. 

After sixth grade, the desire to be something else, something more, just, strengthened. It progressed to longing to change my sexual organs, grow breasts, and have a more supple/feminine face. I was only really comfortable in the presence of persons of the opposite, or I guess the same, gender. 

Except it progressed beyond mostly physical reasons. With the subtle and major differences in culture between men and women, I noticed there was something off about how I felt. I enjoyed femininity, I always preferred and looked up to female characters in media, I always had more of an interest in female-oriented fashion; despite hiding this all from family.

2019-10-07 20:44:51,deph1s,2,4,"Today I had the bravery to go and buy a bra (I measured myself before going there and I acted like sameone told me what to buy), I hid it and I waited to be home alone.
Im the meantime my dac called me (my parents are divorced) and, probably because I was really excited to what I had done, I decided to Teel him that I was thinking about myself and my life, and that he didn't need to worry if I acted strange when we meet (I started to grow my hair, my nails, I shave a lot more and I will buy a kit for waxing).

Than, when I was alone, I started to get every minute more excited, I couldn't stop thinking about it, so when the moment arrived, all my excitement vanished.

In that moment I was extremely worried, questions like: 
what if I look dumb and I did all of this for nothing? What if I don't like myself? Sterted appearing in my mind while I was putting it on, I started to shake a little, I don't have clothes for women, but I have things that can be somewhat used as unisex (kinda) but I choose the best I could think and finally I put socks in the bra.

And then I got in front of the mirror.

The first thing that hit me was how all my anxiety was gone, I was completely calm and concentrated on my reflection.
Then a surprisingly sense of normality came.

It was like I always had breasts.

It wasn't strange. It wasn't the euphoria that I read other people experienced. It was just like ""oh yeah, they look like they always belonged there and have always been"".

I was shocked about that.
Of all things I expected, that was the one I didn't thought.

So I started looking for my look in general.
It was fairly normal, like I dress almost every day, but in that moment I noticed how the sweater made me look more fat because it dropped in a strange way on my stomach, how the pants made my legs, that I am really proud because they look like one that a girl would have, look way bigger on the tight that they are.

And than I almost jumped out of the mirror.
I started to though what I felt and why, but without noticing I went on my bed without taking off my bra. It felt so normal that I sttil have it on right now.

But if before I wanted to see how it would look on me, I now don't want to take it off.
I want real girly clothes and long hair and want to look like one.

I feel so happy now, now I understand what I want to look like and my objective is a lot more clear, but the path is still foggy.
I hope that this experience will help me through this journey

2019-10-08 04:52:49,devc6s,3,4,"Hey. I'm 19 and still trying to figure shit out. I apologise if this post is confusing, English is my 2nd language. This is going to be a little long and I'd be really grateful if you gave me your thoughts.

A year ago, I started going to therapy because of some personal stuff and depression. My psychologist suggested that the reason I feel disconnected and demotivated is because I don't have a sense of identity and community. I don't know what I like, dislike, what gives me pleasure, angers me, etc, which is true, so I'm trying to understand myself better. One of the things that is bothering me now is how I'm not sure about both my gender and sexuality.

I've always been perceived as a girl and I've always been ok with it. I never stopped to think about it until recently, so no, I don't experience any body dysmorphia. Now that I'm learning more about gender, however, I'm identifying a lot as agender, but as it would be more of a rational choice to identify myself this way, I don't know if that would make me ACTUALLY trans. I don't know how to explain this, but I think you get it. Also, I sometimes think it would be unfair to people that suffer with dysmorphia to put myself in the same place as them, if that makes sense. Being called a girl never bothered me before, but it is starting to make me uncomfortable now, but it'because I'm super confused more than anything else, I think.

Sexuality wise, I'm even more confused. I'm sure I like men the most, but I liked some girls in the past in a romantic way, but never in a sexual way. So I guess I'd be androphilic and biromantic? But isn't that weird? I don't know if there's a reason for that.

I apologise if this post is confusing, English is my 2nd language. This is going to be a little long and I'd be really grateful if you gave me your thoughts.\n\nA year ago, I started going to therapy because of some personal stuff and depression. My psychologist suggested that the reason I feel disconnected and demotivated is because I don't have a sense of identity and community. I don't know what I like, dislike, what gives me pleasure, angers me, etc, which is true, so I'm trying to understand myself better. One of the things that is bothering me now is how I'm not sure about both my gender and sexuality.\n\nI've always been perceived as a girl and I've always been ok with it. I never stopped to think about it until recently, so no, I don't experience any body dysmorphia. Now that I'm learning more about gender, however, I'm identifying a lot as agender, but as it would be more of a rational choice to identify myself this way, I don't know if that would make me ACTUALLY trans. I don't know how to explain this, but I think you get it. Also, I sometimes think it would be unfair to people that suffer with dysmorphia to put myself in the same place as them, if that makes sense. Being called a girl never bothered me before, but it is starting to make me uncomfortable now, but it'because I'm super confused more than anything else, I think.\n\nSexuality wise, I'm even more confused. I'm sure I like men the most, but I liked some girls in the past in a romantic way, but never in a sexual way. So I guess I'd be androphilic and biromantic? But isn't that weird? I don't know if there's a reason for that. Unlike the gender situation, I've questioned my sexuality multiple times before, but never thought it was that important, so I'd just stop thinking about.

I am open to all ideas, and I want clarity on the topic of transgenderism. Below is a comment I left on a youtube video about the science of transgenderism that explains my current view and invites everyone to tell me what I have wrong, and show me what science I am missing. This is NOT a transphobic post, I just want to see what I'm missing. Since the video I left this comment on is over a year old, I thought this would be a better place to find a reply.

Here is the comment:

I have a genuine question:

I was born into a Christian family, raised being fed dogma and lies propagated by the bible and modern Christianity. As a direct result of my conservative Christian environment, I was taught that the LGBT (I know there are more letters in the acronym now, but for the sake of brevity) community was sinful. After leaving my religion 3 months ago due to the mounds of empirical evidence pointing to ideas contrary to the Bible and the lack of evidence for god, I realized that the homosexual community was harmless and Christianity was disgusting for saying the contrary (I already knew it was harmless as a Christian, but I still thought it was a ""sin""). Since de-converting, I've kept my mind open to all ideas be they political, social, or moral, as long as they had sufficient scientific evidence to back them up. And I changed my mind on a lot of things. One thing I have not fully addressed, however, is the idea of transgenderism. I searched ""the science behind transgenderism"" on YouTube to look for evidence to back it up, but this was the only video I could really find on the topic. I found the evidence in this video unsatisfactory. The fact that a person whose assigned sex as a child was male but their brain structure slightly more resembles the female brain doesn't necessarily mean that they are justifiably a female, just that they might have tendencies society has stereotyped as ""feminine"". A male can be feminine in quality and in certain realms of genetic code but still be a male. After watching this video I thought that there must be much more science behind transgenderism with how accepted it has become in the mainstream, including extremely educated scientists. So here I will lay out my current view on the subject, and I invite anyone and everyone to show me any flaws in my current view and point me in the direction of science to back up the validity of transgenderism.

1. A person is a male if they are born with an X and Y chromosome (they have male genitalia) and female if they are born with an X and Y chromosome (they have female genitalia). These are the definitions of male and female.

2. Sex and gender are synonymous. I have heard it espoused that sex is the assigned label at birth based on genitalia and gender is what the person identifies as, but I question the latter.

3. A person's identifying themselves as a member of the opposite sex is misled based on the interests and tendencies they experience which society has taught to be landmarks of the opposite sex. For example: a male liking makeup, or certain types of fashion, etc./ a female liking sports, lifting weights (which fuck yeah, I'm a powerlifter and I'm all for women busting those gender role stereotypes) etc.

4. I DO NOT think a person is less valid for being transgender, only they came to the wrong conclusion because of societal labels. By the way, the conclusion I'm talking about is injecting hormones into your body to become more like the opposite sex and/ or mutilating your existing genitalia because you identify as not having those genitalia.

5. I am hesitant on the topic of pronouns. In my mind, pronouns are based off of sex, aka chromosome status/genitalia at birth. Claiming you are of neither sex (and thus claiming the pronouns they/them) could only be true of a hermaphrodite, and to my knowledge there has never been a hermaphroditic human. I know there are men with micro penises and women with enlarged clitorises, but that is still not neutral.

This is not a hostile assertion against the trans community, just a curious inquiry to those who may have more insight on the subject.

I know there are men with micro penises and women with enlarged clitorises, but that is still not neutral.\n\nThis is not a hostile assertion against the trans community, just a curious inquiry to those who may have more insight on the subject.

I recently found out from one of my friends that another friend is Transgender, entirely by mistake they didnt mean to out them. My friend who is transgender, he hasn't told me but he knows that I would be accepting. I'm gay and we talk about LGBT topics often, I know I've made it clear that I'm 100% fine with transgender people.

I know he isn't obligated to tell me, I'm just bringing up that I know that he knows that I'd be okay.

But pretty much, I feel weird knowing that he is a guy and still referring to him as a 'she'.

Is there anyway I could approach this or ask him about it in a way that's okay? Or should I just wait until he comes out to me.

Obviously I'm NOT the victim here but It's just odd that I know. 
In my opinion, if I was him I would want someone who knew to tell me they knew, it would be heartbreaking to come out and find out that they already knew.

What is the best thing to do in this situation because I do want to be supporting him as well and it sucks that I can't y'know.

2019-10-08 20:18:03,df5kgp,2,0,"Hello there, cis woman here. Firstly I just want to preface this text to say that the intent of this post is not to be rude, offend or satire or anything other than really trying to understand more. Sometimes it is difficult to convey tone in text - so just in case I wanted to clarify. 

I live in Ireland and have only ever met 2 Trans women, both at work and both lovely! I chatted to them both about normal stuff but didn’t want to make them uncomfortable asking questions out of nowhere. They both have since moved jobs.

Firstly, could someone tell me the difference between Transgender and Transsexual? I have looked this up on multiple sites and don’t always seem to get the same answer. When people say just ‘trans’, is this referring to both Transsexuals AND Transgenders?

Secondly (this is more of a thought, but please correct me/point out where my thinking is wrong), is having an ‘assigned’ gender really a harmful thing? (When I say harmful, what I mean is that you sometimes read things where people say it is inappropriate to say your newborn is a girl or boy, as they have not yet chosen their gender.) My view is that, why would we not encourage our children that they were born absolutely perfectly (genitals and all) and regardless of these genitals, they can; be, do, dress, think, act, work and play in any way they see fit? What I am trying to get at is, rather than perform surgery on/give hormones to otherwise healthy children/teenagers to remove their breasts, penis, testes or vagina and replace them, surely they are better to keep what they were born with and instead put all our efforts into reassuring they are exactly enough as they are and then parent them to be whatever they want to be (gay, bisexual, straight, pan sexual in terms of sexuality, any ‘look’ they want, any career they want etc).

Since I stopped shaving, she keeps saying things like ""oh you have a colic in your leg hair!"" (witch I do, and I don't like it) And ""Jesus Christ your legs are hairy"" over and over, like I didn't already know. It's making me feel really bad about myself.  My dysphoria kicks in when ever I have my legs out near her.

I've already tried to make her stop, but she's the stubborn type of person, and won't listen. I finally decided to shave just to make her stop. It feels really weird and I don't like it, but it's better then her being mean. 

My sister's not much of a good person either way. She's really nosey and looked through all of my stuff when she came back from collage(including letters from my ex to me), then told me it was fine because ""I don't tell her enough things,"" using us sharing a bedroom as a reason why she should be able to get the code to the lockbox under my bed.

She used to say it would be cool to have a trans brother, but now that she does, I don't know if she likes it. She's really condescending towards me, like I'm lower then her.

My mom knows about her behavior, and we've tried so many times to make her be nicer to me, but she doesn't listen.

2019-10-09 18:21:40,dfl37q,1,1,"Okay, so I’m technically 5 months into taking estradiol (and either a year or more on Spiro). First month I had the kind you dissolve under your tongue, then I switched to injections and lost two months of progress due to an issue I had with doing the injections. So I’ve been on it regularly with no issues since April.

But so far I haven’t noticed a whole lot. I know it’s only been a little over 5 months now, but a lot of people I’ve talked to have at least seen some things happen by that point. But the only things I’ve noticed really are a lowered sex drive and everything that comes with that. But I’m pretty sure that’s just from the spiro because for a few weeks (maybe 2ish months) between April and now, I had been really inconsistent with taking spiro daily and my sex drive and stuff had been pretty normal during that. I’m taking it more consistently now, so it’s fine I guess.

The only things I can think of that are keeping things from happening are that I’m overweight and maybe it’s just harder to tell what’s happening?

There’s also the inconsistency in the spiro which could have screwed some stuff up maybe.

And then the last thing is that maybe I’m just not doing the injections properly? I feel like I am, but I’ve questioned that a lot during the past 5+ months since that 2 month mishap that happened.

I go to planned parenthood if that sparks any ideas. They’ve been pretty great though so far. And at the end of August they did give me the highest dose of estradiol that they’re able to prescribe which I think is a little higher than normal, but I’m not sure.

Sure she's not educated on trans issues, sure she says some things that TERFs might like to take and use as ammunition against us, but HOW THE FUCK is it that a community of people who have, in many cases, experienced so much pain can be this disrespectful to a person struggling with confusion about their identity is beyond me.

I just found out about this through a yt channel I follow, which is usually very positive but in this case was so extremely invalidating of a person who is clearly taking their first steps into figuring out who they are.

2019-10-09 21:35:11,dfntif,0,0,"Okay, so clearly this is a controversial topic amongst the trans community right now, and it's clear to see why. I figured it might be nice to give/get the opinion of someone who is currently questioning and has seen the video and or the multitude of reaction videos in the YouTube universe right now.

I want to start off by saying that I WILL be using they/them pronouns to refer to Trish, only because I do not want to be offensive if they truly are questioning and not just trolling the community. I am aware that this may not be well recieved as they clearly are ignorant to what being non-binary/gender non conforming is.. but it seems that these would be the best suited pronouns to avoid being hypocritical in the event that Trish truly is in a questioning period in regards to their gender.

With that being said, I must say I found the whole thing quite confusing. That being said, I believe a lot of people found it rather confusing. 

As an afab questioning person myself, I started questioning when I decided to present more masculine, in this way I can KIND OF relate to the parts where they mention feeling ""happier"" when presenting more masculine and having envy over the ease of presentation as a masculine presenting person when they were feeling they had to present feminine. I decided to present myself more masculine because I always envied how ""butch"" women could often make themselves look good with little to no effort if they so choose. They didn't have to worry about having long, annoying, straggley hair.. they could dress for comfort over style and still be attractive.. I'm sounding incredibly vain, I'm aware, please don't judge, just give me a minute to get to my point... Lol 

I STARTED presenting masculine for all of these reasons, but never once questioned my gender because of my decision to dress for comfort over style. Never once did my decision to cut my hair, or dress in traditionally masculine clothing make me feel like it was because I was trans. 

But as butch women often experience, dressing in a more masculine way, presenting myself as a more masculine woman, I found myself getting misgendered. And it made me feel things I never expected. The first time someone misgendered me, my heart came up in my throat and I felt this ""aha"" moment.... I wanted to cry happy tears.. it was like this light switch I didn't even know existed, suddenly came on. And then continued to come on EVERY time after.

It sent me on my journey down the rabbit hole if you will, looking back on my life, looking for other hints or clues I may have overlooked or passed off as being cis-normative behavior.. and I found a good bit, however I still have trouble deciphering if they truly are signs of being trans, or if they're just experiences I've noted that somehow fit the typical ""trans narrative"".. 

I struggle with believing that Trish truly is trans ftm, but I don't know that I believe they made the video maliciously? Like, I believe they may be confused about the terms they've used and what they truly mean, and maybe genuinely are blissfully ignorant on the topic and they're just kind of trying to find where they fit? Idk.. 

Anyways.. I'd be interested to see if anyone else who is questioning has seen the video and what your opinions are, did you find you could relate at all? 

Also this isn't just me looking for other questioning people, those who have found themselves fully and are comfortable in their gender identity, I'd love to hear your opinion as well!!

2019-10-10 12:41:48,dfxg99,6,5,"I tried to kill myself in early August. Just a week before my 31st birthday. I’ve been suicidal for most of my life so I should have known better than this, but I tried to slit my wrists in the shower. As I sat there waiting to die, I cried and screamed. I didn’t want it, but the constant pain of being alive was even worse. I was a selfish monster and was simply committing one final selfish act — then everything would be fine. Once I realized I did it wrong and I wasn’t going to die, I was too scared to keep cutting. So I just sat there and cried. I wanted my wife to find me there and pick me up and hold me and tell me everything was going to be okay. She didn’t. I had told her I was trans and needed to explore it and I thought she’d accept it and support me. Instead she told me I was a selfish monster who was going to destroy our family and fuck up our child. She was so angry. She was going to leave me and take my daughter and I didn’t know what else to do. Eventually, I took it back. Just told her I was confused, but that my trans feelings were gone. I really thought they were, but they weren’t. They were just hiding. Just until the danger passed.

I’m too old. I’d transition just in time to become an old crone. I’ll never find anyone to love me. No one ever really has. Not true unconditional love. I dream about meeting a girl who will accept me as I am and make me believe in soulmates again. I dream about becoming myself and finally rediscovering my creative spark. That I will write and paint and play music and do everything I used to love before the world shattered me into a million pieces and I began drifting through life in a dissociative haze. I dream that I can bare my soul to the world and be accepted and loved. But those are just dreams. In the most manic of highs, I believe them. I believe them and know someday I will spend every day dancing in starlight and everything will be beautiful. But then I fall back into darkness. Out of fantasy and back into reality. Ever since I was a small child, my birthday wish every year has been for everything to just “turn out okay.” But nothing is okay and nothing will ever be okay. They’re just dreams and wishes. I have a lot of wishes.

I wish I had understood sooner my family didn’t love me and that it wasn’t my fault. I wish I understood what my father was doing was sexual abuse. I wish I understood it wasn’t normal to be so afraid of your parents that you regularly hid under your bed. I wish I knew what my father did to my brother to make him grow up to molest children. I wish I could have protected him. I wish I had understood my mother wasn’t connected to reality and that when she screamed at me, and strangled me, and threw chairs at me, it didn’t really have anything to do with me. I wish when I blacked out and strangled that boy at school, my teacher had asked what was happening at my home instead of yelling at me and then just dropping it when I couldn’t remember doing anything. I wish someone had said something when every single square inch of my arms were covered in obvious self-inflicted cuts. Something other than “faggot” anyway. I wish I hadn’t given up on high school and dropped out because it was apparent my father was never going to let me leave that awful house no matter what I did. He didn’t want me to grow up and live my own life. He wanted me there, telling him how wonderful he was and becoming a little copy of him. I had to fight tooth-and-nail just to get my foot out the door.

I wish I didn’t have to learn to be such a good liar just to keep myself safe. I wish I didn’t have to teach myself how to smile in the mirror as a child. I wish I had been allowed to be myself. I wish I hadn’t stopped being vegan because my family was starving me. I wish I hadn’t given up on my dreams to travel because they said it was unrealistic. I wish I hadn’t stopped writing fiction and creating art because my parents mocked it relentlessly (while still bragging to everyone about what an artistic, gifted kid they had). I wish I hadn’t stopped being an anarchist because I was told I was stupid. I wish I understood when they asked me what I wanted to be, they were really just asking how I wanted to sell my labor. I wouldn’t have answered so honestly and earnestly. I wouldn’t have been so vulnerable. I wish I’d run off the moment I turned 18 instead of hanging around and thinking I owed these people something.

I remember the cold distant anger of my father when, as a little boy, I said I wanted to be a girl. I wanted to skip and dance and play with the other girls. I love skipping. I didn’t like rough-housing with the other boys. I wanted an E-Z Bake Oven more than anything. I wanted the pink Barbie Power Wheels, but I wasn’t sure why. All I ever got were baseball cards and CDs of music my dad liked. I wish I hadn’t buried all that. Buried it deeper than anything else about myself. I buried it so deep I forgot it was there… until it clawed its way out like a furious lich seeking revenge. On fire and screaming and demanding my full attention.

I wish I recognized myself in mirrors. I wish when people asked if I was gay (oh god, I’ve heard that question countless times) and I’d said no, I’d have realized an unprompted ten minute follow-up monologue about identifying as male despite not being super masculine was probably worth examining. I wish when my first girlfriend offered to let me try on her skirt when I was 19, I had done it. I was afraid I’d like it. No. I knew I’d like it. I so desperately wanted to wear it and twirl with wild abandon. I was afraid of what would happen next. I wish I had listened when my other girlfriends suggested I was… different. But I’d deny it and they’d be relieved. If I became a girl, it would be a “waste of a good cock” they’d say. I wish I had better taste in women.

I wish could redo everything. I wish I knew better back then. I wish I knew to fight back. I wish I knew I had been a wonderful person with a bright future who was worthy of love. I wish I understood the people who abused me and tried to destroy me were monsters. But it’s too late. I’m just an empty shell now, worthy of nothing. 

I wish I had died in that shower.

I wish I didn’t have a feminine self to apologize to when I told her she had to stay locked away.

She’s beautiful. I know it. She’s beautiful and loving and confident and everything I’ve ever wanted to be and I am her and I wish I was her. She isn’t afraid like I am. She doesn’t cry like I do. She doesn’t shut down and sleepwalk through every day. Every year. She’s vibrant and alive and every fiber of her being is infused with creation. She loves herself and I love her.

I just don’t want to be alone. Somebody please tell me I’m not alone. I feel like my life is rapidly coming to an end and I never spent any of it living. I just spent it trying to survive and scrape together some semblance of the stability and safety I never had but so terribly needed and now it’s all over. All that’s left is a yawning expanse of decay and withering until I finally gratefully thankfully die. I did everything “right”. I cut all the toxic people out of my life, I got the steady work-from-home job that pays almost six figures, I bought the house in the suburbs, I got married and had a kid (who is the most wonderful, innocent being and I’m sorry I inflicted existence in this terrible fucking world on her. She deserves better. I’m ashamed of myself), I started going back to school for creative writing, my first love. I went to therapy and put all my childhood trauma behind me... at least, I thought I did. I did everything I was supposed to do and I did it all with a brain that only half works thanks to autism and “depression” which I’m now realizing is bipolar II. Why aren’t I happy? I’m supposed to be happy now. All I want is to sit in a dark closet with a bag over my head and wait for the end.

Tell me there’s still time. Or tell me I’m not like this. Tell me I’m wrong. Tell me I’m cis.

I don’t know what to do.",trans,I don't know what to do.,1570736508.0,"{'created_utc': 1570711308, 'id': 'dfxg99', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'I tried to kill myself in early August. Just a week before my 31st birthday. I’ve been suicidal for most of my life so I should have known better than this, but I tried to slit my wrists in the shower. As I sat there waiting to die, I cried and screamed. I didn’t want it, but the constant pain of being alive was even worse. I was a selfish monster and was simply committing one final selfish act — then everything would be fine. Once I realized I did it wrong and I wasn’t going to die, I was too scared to keep cutting. So I just sat there and cried. I wanted my wife to find me there and pick me up and hold me and tell me everything was going to be okay. She didn’t. I had told her I was trans and needed to explore it and I thought she’d accept it and support me. Instead she told me I was a selfish monster who was going to destroy our family and fuck up our child. She was so angry. She was going to leave me and take my daughter and I didn’t know what else to do. Eventually, I took it back. Just told her I was confused, but that my trans feelings were gone. I really thought they were, but they weren’t. They were just hiding. Just until the danger passed.\n\nI’m too old. I’d transition just in time to become an old crone. I’ll never find anyone to love me. No one ever really has. Not true unconditional love. I dream about meeting a girl who will accept me as I am and make me believe in soulmates again. I dream about becoming myself and finally rediscovering my creative spark. That I will write and paint and play music and do everything I used to love before the world shattered me into a million pieces and I began drifting through life in a dissociative haze. I dream that I can bare my soul to the world and be accepted and loved. But those are just dreams. In the most manic of highs, I believe them. I believe them and know someday I will spend every day dancing in starlight and everything will be beautiful. But then I fall back into darkness. Out of fantasy and back into reality. Ever since I was a small child, my birthday wish every year has been for everything to just “turn out okay.” But nothing is okay and nothing will ever be okay. They’re just dreams and wishes. I have a lot of wishes.\n\nI wish I had understood sooner my family didn’t love me and that it wasn’t my fault. I wish I understood what my father was doing was sexual abuse. I wish I understood it wasn’t normal to be so afraid of your parents that you regularly hid under your bed. I wish I knew what my father did to my brother to make him grow up to molest children. I wish I could have protected him. I wish I had understood my mother wasn’t connected to reality and that when she screamed at me, and strangled me, and threw chairs at me, it didn’t really have anything to do with me. I wish when I blacked out and strangled that boy at school, my teacher had asked what was happening at my home instead of yelling at me and then just dropping it when I couldn’t remember doing anything. I wish someone had said something when every single square inch of my arms were covered in obvious self-inflicted cuts. Something other than “faggot” anyway. I wish I hadn’t given up on high school and dropped out because it was apparent my father was never going to let me leave that awful house no matter what I did. He didn’t want me to grow up and live my own life. He wanted me there, telling him how wonderful he was and becoming a little copy of him. I had to fight tooth-and-nail just to get my foot out the door.\n\nI wish I didn’t have to learn to be such a good liar just to keep myself safe. I wish I didn’t have to teach myself how to smile in the mirror as a child. I wish I had been allowed to be myself. I wish I hadn’t stopped being vegan because my family was starving me. I wish I hadn’t given up on my dreams to travel because they said it was unrealistic. I wish I hadn’t stopped writing fiction and creating art because my parents mocked it relentlessly (while still bragging to everyone about what an artistic, gifted kid they had). I wish I hadn’t stopped being an anarchist because I was told I was stupid. I wish I understood when they asked me what I wanted to be, they were really just asking how I wanted to sell my labor. I wouldn’t have answered so honestly and earnestly. I wouldn’t have been so vulnerable. I wish I’d run off the moment I turned 18 instead of hanging around and thinking I owed these people something.\n\nI remember the cold distant anger of my father when, as a little boy, I said I wanted to be a girl. I wanted to skip and dance and play with the other girls. I love skipping. I didn’t like rough-housing with the other boys. I wanted an E-Z Bake Oven more than anything. I wanted the pink Barbie Power Wheels, but I wasn’t sure why. All I ever got were baseball cards and CDs of music my dad liked. I wish I hadn’t buried all that. Buried it deeper than anything else about myself. I buried it so deep I forgot it was there… until it clawed its way out like a furious lich seeking revenge. On fire and screaming and demanding my full attention.\n\nI wish I recognized myself in mirrors. I wish when people asked if I was gay (oh god, I’ve heard that question countless times) and I’d said no, I’d have realized an unprompted ten minute follow-up monologue about identifying as male despite not being super masculine was probably worth examining. I wish when my first girlfriend offered to let me try on her skirt when I was 19, I had done it. I was afraid I’d like it. No. I knew I’d like it. I so desperately wanted to wear it and twirl with wild abandon. I was afraid of what would happen next. I wish I had listened when my other girlfriends suggested I was… different. But I’d deny it and they’d be relieved. If I became a girl, it would be a “waste of a good cock” they’d say. I wish I had better taste in women.\n\nI wish could redo everything.

I'm 30, recently out as a trans woman, 3 months into hrt, and all's been well on that front. No idea if I'll ever pursue any surgery, but I know I want my facial hair gone. Bums me out to shave it every day.

I moved from New York to Los Angeles earlier this month. I had been pursuing hair removal options in NY, but held off b/c I was intimidated by the prices (I did one laser consultation and it seemed to be \*way\* out of my budget).

So now I'm looking for options in or near LA. Probably just electro, but I'm open to re-exploring laser if I can find a much cheaper clinic. I've reached out to a number of electro clinics, and looked up a lot of people's individual experiences, but the prices and number of sessions seem to be all over the map; I've read accounts of people who got a dozen sessions, and people who got hundreds and hundreds of sessions. Makes it very hard to estimate cost, among other things. Pretty overwhelming.

So I was wondering if anyone could help provide some clarity or narrow my focus on this. I'm on a grad student budget, uncertain if I'll have an income a year from now, so price is a major factor (not that I have any idea what is or isn't reasonable). One clinic recommended I go to the electrolysis school ([https://www.aielectrology.com/](https://www.aielectrology.com/)) down by Santa Ana for cheaper prices.

[im sorry if this may be triggering how I explain things I’m very new to this and I’m super confused pls don’t hate]

Me: Shawn He/Him
Scrawny boy, gay, has anxiety

Them: Benji He/they (was Lindsey she/her)
Long-ish hair, almost +sized, feminine body, large breasts

[both 15]

So we both have super religious poor parents. we both go to the same super religion high school. At the first day of school we got our IDs with our photos on them everything’s great we both have two new friends: Kayla &amp; Saundra. On one day I check out group chat to tho see Lindsey coming out as Trans saying that she’s scared about her parents. We say we’re proud of them and everyone (expect me) goes on with their day. I’m scared tho! 


Why I’m scared:

 • ID has them looking rather girl-like and her body looks like a normal girl. 
•We’ll probably not be able to change our ID photo through those 4 years oh high school
• everyone knows her, calls her Lindsey, using she/her pronouns
•her parents would never support them
•my parents would never support them
•idk what pronouns to use when they’re not near my because if I say he or use the name Benji everyone will be confused and ask questions
• not used to calling them Benji
•I feel like I’m betraying them if I say Lindsey or use she/her behind her back
•pretty much only their friends will support him
•their parents are too poor to pay for any surgeries they might want
❗️❗️• I’m scared that this might be a phase and that they’ll do permanent mistakes❗️❗️

2019-10-11 20:52:11,dgl4i9,2,2,"Honestly this is a question I’ve been think about a while now, is it worth it to live as me. You might say of course it’s worth it to live as yourself, ur always worth it or it gets better etc same shit, but honestly I don’t see the point to go through all that to end up in the same place as I would if I live when I’ve got a rope and a tree. 

If I carry on identifying as my natural born gender I could probably keep going a few years if I keep going downhill at my current rate. I didn’t really get any disforia till recently, and even then it’s barely anything though I’ve known about my identity for a while, I don’t have crippling depression or anxiety, I got to an all girls school, I have friends, some who are also trans, I try and ask but we end up talking bout some useless shit. it’s not the disforia that gets me, it’s the ability I have to just carry on till I suffocate, the choice I have, I know it won’t get better, but I don’t really know how bad it will be and somehow that lets me carry on to the edge. it also makes me feel like a fucking fraud, like because I ain’t slicing my wrists or punching holes in walls I don’t count, I’m just somehow craving attention in a twisted way, it makes it worse I have people who are trans around me cause it also feels like if I come out tomorrow everyone’s gunna think that too and how I am so different in there experiences but so different. 

I have a lot of walls up, it sometimes stops me from feeling things I should, sometimes stuff gets through and it’s like a knife, I don’t know how things are going to hit me, like this, I’ve known for a while but it’s just starting to wiggle through, the better things get the worse I become. If I were to transition in to who I am, I will have stigma, bathrooms, higher murder rates, coming out, waiting lists, just life etc etc I’m sure ur familiar, it just all that shit to deal with and it’s like why, I commend people who do it anyway, I have nothing to look forward to, nothing to live for, no reason to be myself, I could say a lot of time and money with 50p to buy a few packs of paracetamol, except if I did that I’d have a few people potentially coming with me.

The question of is it worth it to transition carry’s nicely onto the point of life but with a demented twist, I don’t think I will ever find it, I’ll probably be alone forever due to my fucking asexuality, just another deformity in my brain, actually just everything in my life’s fucked up, there’s always a problem after the next, I laugh and joke but I don’t even remember the last time I felt happy, I’m almost 15, god was my childhood that depressing. I could leave a video explaining it all to send to the people who care about me and move onto whatever’s next, I almost want to for curiosity’s sake. till then I’m doing drugs at the weekend, maybe I’ll find what I’m looks for, probably not, I’m just there for the ride. 

As I’m reading this back I’m kinda truly feeling what I’ve written, when I say I’m not depressed it’s not within the conventions of that mental illness, I just live, I think a lot about life but tend not to dwel. still weighing up my life is a serious consideration, I just see one way a way and I hate it, I see another way and I know I’ll miss out and others will hate it but at least I’m at peace, I dunno which is worse.",trans,Is it worth it?,1570852331.0,"{'created_utc': 1570827131, 'id': 'dgl4i9', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Honestly this is a question I’ve been think about a while now, is it worth it to live as me.

There are many discord servers out there that already do this and do this well, but I was hoping that people in the Discord server I'm making might also assist with their own knowledge from the rest of the world so that I could add that to the website too.

Roleplaying games have been a big part of my life for years and even before I realized what was up, I always played women to the point where I would avoid games that didn't at least give me the option. Not because I thought the games themselves were bad but because they completely failed to engage me in any meaninful way.

It got a little more serious when I started joining online groups. One of the earliest ones was the RP server for Star Wars: The Old Republic and I interacted with people in character as a woman. Still didn't connect the dots for at least five years but that's besides the point.

Fast forward to present day and I've been playing on one of the private servers for Conan Exiles. I've made great friends there and seen a long and interesting story unfold between all our characters. We've gotten to know each other as people over the months we've spent together.   
What happened was that a previous administrator of the server takes over after over a year of being away. Not the original owner of the server or anything like that but I digress.

He decides to reset the server. Not for any technical reasons that would require a wipe, which we all understand happens from time to time but because he's unhappy with the direction the server has taken. Namely people not really caring much about the aspects of the lore he has written for it. Not ignoring it, as it is cannon on the server, but simply not showing much interest in it and rather continuing the stories we've all been crafting with friends and strangers alike.

He declares years of stories to be null and void as he wants to bring it more in line with his vision.  
Point being, a lot of us feel robbed of some of the best experiences we've had in the game and decide to leave.  


In a discussion about this on a discord server for a lot of the people I know from there, I snap. I feel unreasonably hurt by this and I just ramble on (much like I do now) about how much I do not agree with this. The character I played on this server was the one outlet I had at the time for being me. I'd realized I'm trans before this happened but it was still nice to put things aside for a time and just really be myself through this supposedly meaningless online character.  
Prior to all this very few of them knew much about my life out of the game and generally, they assumed I was a woman.  
I told them about how deeply hurt I am about something so seemingly meaningless and how the game itself is just a game but the stories we made together was among the only times I could feel like I was really me. I told them about how I'd been struggling with my identity during the time we played and how nice it was for me to just put my worries aside for a while and just not think about it. Give myself some time to rest.

Not a single person in that chat had anything but understanding and kind words to give. Many said that the game didn't mean nearly as mych to them as that, but that they could at least sympathize with me, if not understand.

You'll have to look elsewhere.' And they always talk about their private counseling. They don't take insurance, but they have a 'sliding scale' and can 'work with you on prices.' When I looked into getting counseling there, I didn't have a job, and I tried to work with them on prices. The absolute lowest they were willing to charge was one hundred and seventy five dollars for a single session. And that's just the first session. After the first session, it went up to two twenty five. That place doesn't care about the LGBTQ+ Community. They just want your money. Shittiest place I've ever gone for support. Save yourself the horrible experiences and deterioration of your mental health and just never go there. So yea it's not a good place to go. The people there aren't allies in the least bit. They just want to conduct social experiments and get paid to sit around and do nothing. Never go there. I've had nothing but terrible experiences there."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Avoid the resource center in Dallas AT ALL COSTS', 'created': 1571137551.0}"

2019-10-15 06:05:38,di3kfk,0,1,"Hi, I posted this elsewhere but I feel like its kind of getting buried there and at the moment and feeling pretty anxious about this and don't really have an outlet.  


I am posting here today as I am totally new to this and a bit confused and just not sure how things are going to proceed. Or even really how to go about this.

Without going into too much detail about my past and growing up. I am 29 years old, biologically male, recently have been coming more and more to terms with me not being very happy in my current body.

Growing up I was always kind of on the feminine side of things, while still also being very much a boy. But to this day pretty much all of my good friends are girls, and tbh I dont really bond or get close to guys on the same level. I have always been obsessed with cute things, I can remember butting heads with my mom as a kid over certain t-shirts and how no those are for girls, having certain toys that were most definitely meant for girls etc.

In my teens I started dressing more cute and effeminate while still staying strongly on the male side of things. Growing up I did have an attraction to female clothes, cross dressing etc but tbh I didnt really think much of it. As I became an adult I definitely starting having moments where I would see girls in public and be envious that I could not dress that way and be perceived as cute or wear cute clothes. Once at the bus loop I saw two tiny asian girls in matching pastel pink shortalls (tbh I love a lot of cute ""childish things, I have tons of stuffed animals etc in my house, also mad that this is way more acceptable for girls than guys) and being very envious. Me being a 6 foot 3 white guy, although very slim and all leg with very high hips I was sad I would never be adorable in that way.

Around age 19 I started to get into heroin, not long after I got into the skinhead scene (nothing to do with racism the punk rock music etc scene) I was shaving my head and comfortable looking masculine although definitely there was always the same undercurrent but it and some of my other issues and desires got pushed way down as I simple did not have the energy to deal with them.

On October 4th 2015, my 25th birthday I got clean off heroin. Not long after I started going back to wanting to be cute, feminine etc more than ever. Grew my hair back out etc. This kind of floundered a bit until the summer if 2018. I had been removing all my body hair for awhile, although ive never really liked it. I started wearing jean short shorts, shortalls etc with shaved legs in public, cute animal backpacks, while not really crossdressing definitely pushing the limits on what most people would consider acceptable male attire past the age of like 5 hahaha.

I made friends online, started kind of considering myself more of femboy. Whereas I dont really have an overwhelming desire to be perceived as female if I had the option I would change to a female body right now. I am very very very frustrated that I just turned 29 and feel like I am finally dressing and presenting myself the way I want to but feeling like I have very few years left of being happy with how I look. I thought I had a fear of getting older, which I kind of do, but a trans online friend of mine asked me if I had a fear of getting older or a fear of getting older and becoming more masculine as a man and it kind of got to me.

I know I want my body to be as feminine as possible. At the very least trying to hault me from becoming any more masculine. In a perfect world I would have a female body even though I dont really feel the overwhelming need to be categorized as female I dont really want to be male either. I get intense gratification when I see pictures of myself dressed feminine or flat our girly and being able to look cute but not necessarily having to full on pass. If I knew I would be happy with the end result I think I would want to go all the way, but one, I don't know if thats realistic, and two,I work as a mechanic in a very masculine work environment. I fear how becoming too obviously feminine could effect my career, not so much at this job, but if i ever did have to find another one in the field. I dont see myself being very successful. I dont know if this is making any sense, all I know at this point in time is I would like to do what I can to be moving in the direction of a more feminine body rather than male. I get a mental image of me in a few years trying to wear certain things and looking like my dad and it makes me want to cry. I saw a picture online of like a 50 something year old man in shortalls and it spend me spiraling into some serious self introspection as dumb and stupid as that sounds. I do not know where exactly I stand in terms of being trans, but I know I am not going to be happy if I get even 1% more masculine than I am now, but would be more happy if I woke up and found myself to look more feminine.

Last november I reached out to a place that seemed like almost a one stop shop for everything. I wanted HRT so bad and wanted to move forward. They emailed me back to let me know they no longer offered doctor services and every other avenue seemed to be way too overwhelming and confusing and I just couldn't handle it.

Recently at the urging of another friend I dug up the email and followed one of their recommendations of contacting transcarebc and getting a personal health navigator. They replied to me on friday and I am eagerly awaiting their response to put me in touch with a counsellor etc.

I was also hesitant because I felt that unless I basically told them I wanted to identify as female and go all the way hrt would not be an option. However a new friend I made a few days ago told me that no that is not true and it is possible for gender non conforming type people who want to look feminine to get hrt.

I feel like if I had been tackling this when I was 20 maybe I would say fuck it, Im transitioning. Now I feel like I would be more comfortable closer to the middle ground at least to start but im not sure if this is realistic. I also feel like if it comes down to it and my options are down to continue life as a man, or have to completely transition I feel like idk I would be more happy trying to live as a female than I would be aging and getting more masculine every day. I feel like I wasted so much time on heroin and that of all the things it took from me it may have put me a decade behind or even stopped me from becoming who I really want to be.

I am really not sure whats going to happen next, if there is things I should say, things I shouldnt say? Things I should do or see first? I have very supportive friends etc, I have zero interest in getting my family involved however. I am not very well versed in this scene, hrt, trans people etc. However I did make some friends online, and I made an alt facebook account so I dont have to maintain a 90 person block list every time I want to talk about these things and a lot of friends of those friends have added me and all seem super nice and cool. Also, judging by the amount of weird men from foreign countries trying to add me every day based on a picture where you cant see my face and I have no tits I must not be doing too bad of a job of looking cute!

&amp;#x200B;

and because I am proud so far of the change ive had in my looks since getting clean here are some kinda crappy pictures, im hoping that I will be able to be even happier with how I look soon!

I don’t know what to do, everything about the shots make me uncomfortable. I’ve been doing this for 7 months now, and I messed a shot up once, my leg has been hurting nonstop for the past month, it’s a light tolerable pain but I absolutely can’t stand it anymore. I’m scared of messing up again and now I have insertion fear &amp; anxiety. 

I told my doctor about it and he told me it’s fine, but it’s just getting worse. Because of the 2 weeks (biweekly shots), more fear builds up progressively after each week passes and I focus too much on the shot dates, when I just want to live normally and not sob the days prior to my shot.

I feel so much better mentally, I’m so much happier, but no matter how much I tell myself all of this is worth it, I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT stand this process. I used to have 100% no fear of needles or ANYTHING, I did my shots by myself just fine, but over time this has made me develop a legitimate fear. My shot is today and I’ve been sobbing for the past 3 hours.

My family members offered to do it for me but before they insert the needle I get aggressive and push them away and start freaking the hell out because I’m afraid they’re gonna mess up and I’m gonna bust another vein.

I’ve pushed back my shots a total of an ENTIRE WEEK + 1 DAY because of how scared I am now, if I stuck with my shot days I would’ve taken it last week on Monday.

From what I understand, a core idea of truscum ideology is that gender dysphoria is required to be trans. It seems like this idea is frowned upon, but I’m not quite sure why. What would it mean to be transgender and not have gender dysphoria? What would be the reason for transitioning then? I don’t mean these questions in an accusatory way, I’m genuinely confused.

The first thing I think I would like to tackle is a beard transplant. Does anyone have experience with this?

I have very thick hair on my scalp and am not worried about losing it as there’s virtually no baldness in my family history. 

Also, I’m not sure when I should get the ball rolling on phalloplasty (or how). I am very certain about wanting to go that route, though.

2019-10-17 06:17:18,dj2a70,2,5,"So I'm finally ready to come out to a large group of my friends--namely, the trumpet section in my college marching band. There's about forty of us, and I've already got the message typed up and ready to copy/paste whenever I decide the time is right. I'm already out to two of them, and I trust almost all of them to be mature about it and to be encouraging and supportive and accepting once I come out to the rest. 

Here's the problem. I trust *almost* all of them. There are three people in the group who I really don't trust with this information. They're all more conservative-leaning. 

One is a straight-up white supremacist, so I imagine his views on LGBTQ+ issues are about as primitive as his views on race.

One is a regular old conservative Trump apologist, though he insists he doesn't like Trump. He's told me to my face (not knowing I'm trans, of course) that he thinks gender non-conformity is a mental illness and trans people need mental help instead of being allowed to transition.

And one is my roommate and one of my best friends, but has told me before he supports Trump. He makes a lot of gay/trans jokes, and I really worry that when he eventually finds out it will complicate things for a number of reasons. For one, we live together. He's sleeping in a bed about fifteen feet away from me as I type this. If he doesn't accept me, and isn't comfortable with sharing a room with a girl (even though I'm still very much only attracted to girls), not only will things become incredibly awkward between us, but I don't know if he'll look into switching into another dorm, or making me switch into another dorm. This is a bit of an extreme, worst-case scenario, but I still worry. 

Should I let three people likely not accepting me stop me from coming out to the other 35ish people who I anticipate to either support me or just not care (which, frankly, is better than actively despising me)?

I'm currently in the process of coming out of the closet completely. My friends know and most my family knows. There are a few holdouts because I know they will not take it well at all. 2 of these holdouts are my grandparents that only come to town once or twice a year but always for Christmas. I was planning on telling them after the Christmas festivities were done this year. I feel like this is the only time I can tell them face to face before I'm to far along on hormones which I start mid November. 

My question is should I wait and tell them over the phone which my mother is suggesting or should I go with my plans and tell them at Christmas time.

2019-10-17 14:17:22,dj70i8,3,3,"Hello! This is literally my first post on Reddit ever, so I hope I'm in the right place. Apologies if I'm doing it wrong! 

I'm looking for advice on how to give my sister the best support and encouragement that I can.  I should also add that most of my trans terminology is dated, because I looked up most of this stuff when I was like, sneaking my then-girlfriend my birth control as a teenager and boy howdy all of this stuff has changed! I'm a den mother to a bunch of trans kids in my city now and I've picked up a lot from them but I know that the terminology is important and I want to get it right.

For background:

My sister (35) has been on HRT for a few years now, but she  still dresses in masc clothing, doesn't wear makeup, etc.  She's pretty much a homebody and hasn't been working for a long time, but she has a few IRL friends that she is comfortable around and who are supportive of her. (She and I live in different countries, so I can't give all that much IRL support.) My family knows that she's trans, and they claim to be supportive, but nobody has seen her for a few years because we're all pretty far-flung. 

We're all meeting up for a big family reunion at my brother's (47 cis M) house. It's around my nephew's third birthday, so there will be lots of little kids around and their parents, who may not share anything in common with my brother's family other than ""has a child of approximately 3 years of age.""  My brother seems accepting of our sister, but he's also pretty traditionally heterosexual and macho, and he lives in an part of the country that is full of rich Republicans.

Anyway, my sister is going to be dressing femme for the first time around my family, and I can tell she's really nervous about it. One of the problems is that she's big and tall, and she doesn't ""pass"" very well. (I know that ""passing"" is bullshit, and fuck being ""one of the good ones,"" but it's going to affect how much static she gets.)  My sister is also one of the most sensitive people I have ever met, and it's one of the things I love about her the most, but it means that any transphobia hits her really hard. 

Anyway. 

I want to know how I can support her the most in this time. I've asked her how I can help, and given her the ""I got your back"" speech, and said, [if it sucks, we can leave](https://twitter.com/dasharez0ne/status/1125839557352742913?lang=en)! I also can do makeup and can bring a wig and all that.  

Is there stuff that she might not think to ask for? Is there more I can do?  I just want to do the best for my sister. I know I can't protect her from all of the bullshit she's gonna get but I want to be able to be as proactive as possible.

I have several trans friends. And all of them basically do the same thing.

When we meet new people or go to new places the conversation always ends up at their trans and that they used to be a different gender. it's almost like they are advertising to people that their trans and their introductions.

if trends people want to transition to a different gender why do they always remind everyone that they used to be a different gender? why not just tell people that they're a boy if they used to be a girl but never mention the fact that they used to be a girl.

A lot of my transfriends get very very upset when they get misgendered. yeti don't mind telling everyone that they used to be a different gender and show pictures.

I'm sorry, but I just don't understand. If you want to be a boy why not just declare yourself a boy. Why do you have to bring up the fact that they used to be a girl? 

If you want to be identified as a boy, or as a girl.

So before we get into all hahaha the stuff below here, a bit about me! I'm 35, work as a writer in a big city and am somehow perplexed that I made it work out. I came out about 13 years ago and started HRT around 2007/2008, going full time shortly after 2009 and, for various reasons I'd rather not get into, went stealth a few years after that. Had my surgery (Class of Brassard '12), and have mostly been living my life contending with some serious depression and CPTSD that has, haha, been such a god damned delight. 

ANYWAYS. After something like nine years or so living stealth, I'm starting to reevaluate my feelings on that. Admittedly it's really...painful to hear a lot of discussion about trans issues happening all over the world and being unable to speak up too much about them out of fear of outing myself and being unable to bring my own personal experience into things (because haha I went stealth for a number of reasons, safety being one of them). No shade to anyone who chooses to go stealth, but personally at this point I'm starting to feel the constraints I put on myself and I'm...regretting it.

I also really freaking miss the sense of community. The sense of belonging I had with my trans brothers and sisters. Thanks to a fun mix of depression and the industry I work in, most people I know IRL are cis and...that's not fantastic.

Anyways, I don't know where this is going, but I just thought that something I'd like to do is...well...reconnect with more supportive trans people so I don't feel so alone. I've been a lurker on a few subreddits here, but I guess this is my ""long time listener, first time caller"" moment. It's scary, I'm worrying that I'm a bit too old to be in these spaces anymore, or if I'm even welcome. But here we are.

Hello! Name’s Maxy and I prefer he/him but okay with any pronouns. I’m a Filipino so you might have an idea of my family. It was a long exhausting battle for me but I had hard time trying to find the right time to come out to my family and it took about 6 years to tell them. I told my family this August with my boyfriend’s support and they accepted me (through text because I was in college). I cried so hard on that day. My college just accepted who I am since I never want to hear my birth name again. It felt like the weight on my shoulders was lifted.. 


Since then, I do want to change myself and did plan to get binders but another time. I wanted to get a haircut but I don’t want my hair to be pixie cut but I often enjoyed having a haircut and it’s silly but on internet, they called it ‘bisexual hair’ so you get the idea of what my hair looked like. My boyfriend and I still struggle to find the right haircut lol.. Time will tell.


Even though my parents accepted me as male, they never used my name or anything at all. I feel like they’re stuck to their old ways? They still call me by birth name and she/her... My boyfriend correctly wrote a message with right pronouns and name to my mom and she didn’t oppose which is fine. But I just wish they’re not joking around and hurting my feelings. 


Any ideas? I love my family very much but I wish they didn’t put my identity as a joke. Bonus, I don’t think they told their families about me so big ouch.

2019-10-20 02:31:31,dkdoip,1,4,"(content warning: I talk about dysphoria , issues with being percieved as female by others and ""passing"", and other bad feels which may be all too relatable, read at your own risk)   


A bit of life story for context. I transitioned in my teens. My transition was kind of a gradual thing, at 13 I started growing my hair out, at 14 I started to straighten my now shoulder-length hair (I will never forget the euphoria I felt when I straightened my hair for the first time), started wearing make-up shortly before turning 15. For a while, I was presenting female, long hair, make-up, etc. but I identified as an androgyne/ gender non conforming male. At 16 is when I did the whole name and pronoun change process, and at 17 I started spiro and estrogen at 19 (I bitterly regret that gap- I really wish I was self-aware about being trans much earlier)  


My biggest regret is that my body went through the changes of endogenous testosterone and not being aware of the more physical aspects of my dysphoria until it was too late. Initially, the euphoria of having long hair and being able to express my feminine side with make-up kind of blindsided the physical aspects of my dysphoria, but as time went on and testosterone did more damage, I found that hair/makeup/clothes were no longer sufficient to make me look like a girl, and that the ""guy underneath"" started showing through even with all the feminine presentation, so that is when the physical dysphoria and awareness that I am trans and not gender non conforming hit me like a brick. I also hated the effect high testosterone levels had on my libido, it felt so evil and completely alien to me and was actually traumatizing. It felt like I was being violated by my own body. I am still traumatized by that.   


Now-a-days, I have been on estrogen for 7 years and a few months. HRT has been the only part of my physical transition, since I cannot afford things like surgery or electrolysis.   


I got off very lucky in the sense that my skeletal frame below the neck was pretty much immune to the effects of testosterone- although I am tall for a woman at 5'9"", I have a very proportionately small frame and have very narrow wrists, ribcage, small hands/feet, narrow shoulders, etc. I know many cis women who are like 5'2"" who wear an equal/larger shoe size than me, have thicker wrists, ribcage, wider shoulders, etc. so I am very fortunate in that sense. My breasts/hips are pretty small, but thanks to my small frame, they really stand out.    


Unfortunately, I didn't fare so well above the neck, and have a fairly prominent Adam's apple, facial hair, large forehead with an ""M"" shaped hairline, large nose with a hump, long midface, etc. I at least have good eyes and cheekbones, which help a lot when I put make-up on. My voice used to be extremely deep, has improved a lot with training, but still has more husky undertones than I would like, especially when I am sad/tired and have a ""frog in my throat"".   


This puts me in a situation where people perceive me incredibly differently depending on my presentation (and mood, because that affects my voice resonance a lot- I sound more masculine if I'm in a bad mood due to the ""frog in my throat"", which often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy if I am clocked).   


If I am wearing full make-up, hair done to hide the ""bad"" facial features, have a good skin day for shaving with minimal razor burn, make sure to keep my head tilted at an angle where my Adam's apples is less visible, am in a good mood and am easily able to speak in a bright voice with no husky resonance, etc. I am percieved as a cisgender woman, and even sometimes an \*attractive\* cisgender woman. I have become pretty good at make-up over the years, and I have figured out how to do my make-up in a way where I am able to make my ""good"" features (eyes and cheekbones) look very prominent while using contouring and highlighting to make my face appear softer and more feminine, so I can make myself legit look pretty good if all the conditions are right. As long as I take 2 hours to get ready in the morning and remain in a happy mood, I am nearly unclockable.  However, all it takes to ruin this is something as simple as talking once negative emotions put a ""frog"" in my throat and fucking up my voice, or staying at someone's house overnight, or inclement weather- the transformation for the worse from just one night of sleep or a windy/rainy day is immense.   


By morning, my hair becomes thin, greasy, and stringy after just one night without washing it. It no longer frames my face well, and my masculine facial features become prominent. By the morning, even if I may not have a 5 o'clock shadow per se, my face begins to feel like sandpaper and it just starts looking ""off"" even though my facial stubble is blonde. I've had times where people would touch the lower half of my face at times like this and completely lose my shit. Even if I keep my make-up on overnight (which I like to avoid since it's bad for the skin), I no longer have baby soft/smooth skin due to the facial hair coming in which ruins everything no matter how intact my make-up is. No matter how well I was passing the night before, those things usually clock me by morning.   


All this makes everything \*still\* feel like this performance, or disguise, that I am putting on. Even if I may have become exceptionally \*good at it\* to the point that people initially think I am an attractive cisgender woman, the fact that it can all be taken away if I wash my face and buzz my hair short makes it feel all so inauthentic. It really messes with my head.   


I am very well integrated socially, everyone that knows me thinks of me as nothing but female. But knowing what the ""real me"" still looks like underneath all the hair and make-up, I still feel like this is some kind of disguise or performance. It made sense during the early parts of my transition for me to feel like I was ""pretending"", since it was still new and everyone was getting used to it, but for that feeling to persist now after all these years and with social acceptance is really disappointing to me. I hate that I still feel like this. **I feel like being a woman is still something that I \*want to be\*, rather than something that I actually \*am\*.**   


It really sucks because the pressure to meet those cisnormative, feminine beauty standards is almost making me feel like being female is becoming this inauthentic goal that I cannot achieve. This really sucks because in the past, being male was this inauthentic thing that I could never correctly play the role of, yet as a female, I don't feel authentic for different reasons. As a male, my personality betrayed me, but as a female, my body betrays me.   


I have thought about whether maybe I am non-binary and perhaps the reason this all feels so inauthentic is maybe because I should embrace some of the more androgynous or ""in-between"" aspects of myself and not feel so pressured to meet this standard of femininity that I put on myself. But it's like so confusing, because what is this problem is actually because of very persistent binary dysphoria? 

I really wish I could afford facial hair removal, FFS, trachea shave, etc. so that I can get to a point where I can still look female even with no make-up and a buzz cut and no longer feel like I have to put all this effort into being authentic. As long as I need to put any ""effort"" into it will always feel like being a woman is something that I \*want\* rather than \*am\* and it will feel like some sort of disguise or 24/7 drag.",trans,Imposter Syndrome- I still feel like I *want to be* a woman instead of actually feeling like I *am* a woman,1571563891.0,"{'created_utc': 1571538691, 'id': 'dkdoip', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 4, 'selftext': '(content warning: I talk about dysphoria , issues with being percieved as female by others and ""passing"", and other bad feels which may be all too relatable, read at your own risk)   \n\n\nA bit of life story for context.

Since before I even knew what trans was or that is existed, I always longed to be a girl and even came close. My mom said I surprised the doctors when I came out with a penis since the ultrasound they gave her months ago showed a girl. At a young age, I already decided my birth name wasn't for me but I just shorted it and treated my full as a dead name before I even knew what that meant.

Highschool came with many struggles, but by then I learned more. At the time, I just thought I could just try to be a feminine boy at heart, despite how ugly I thought I looked. All my close friends were coming out or already came out, most of them realizing that they were trans...but I couldn't accept myself. My mom is supportive but i still can't tell her, else the church will know, my unsupportive family will know and I'll be ridiculed.
At 22, I'm now coming to terms with myself despite struggle. I've already thought of names and kept browsing r/egg_irl because I was always in denial. I've seen my friends change their names, some by He and others by They and I'm so proud of them, but I couldn't accept myself. One of my closest friends to me wrote a poem inspired by me as well always wished we could swap bodies so we could be true to our hearts. That pushed me to take a step, and Friday, October 18th 2019 I changed my named.

Why is this hair growing, why am I not pretty like the girls, why do I feel so wrong in my own skin? I already knew I liked both boys and girls, but I didn't realize my full identity yet.\nHighschool came with many struggles, but by then I learned more. At the time, I just thought I could just try to be a feminine boy at heart, despite how ugly I thought I looked. All my close friends were coming out or already came out, most of them realizing that they were trans...but I couldn't accept myself. My mom is supportive but i still can't tell her, else the church will know, my unsupportive family will know and I'll be ridiculed.\nAt 22, I'm now coming to terms with myself despite struggle. I've already thought of names and kept browsing r/egg_irl because I was always in denial. I've seen my friends change their names, some by He and others by They and I'm so proud of them, but I couldn't accept myself. One of my closest friends to me wrote a poem inspired by me as well always wished we could swap bodies so we could be true to our hearts. That pushed me to take a step, and Friday, October 18th 2019 I changed my named.\nMy name is Xylia, and I'm going to start loving myself."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Finally Coming Out (to my friends) [Pre-E MtF, 22]', 'created': 1571635963.0}"

Also, I apologize if anything I say offends anyone. This is not intended to offend you or be malicious in any way. This is just how I feel. (Context: I am 18 years old, biologically female.)

Ever since I learned about the existence of trans people (Caitlyn Jenner coming out when I was in middle school) I have been struggling to block out thoughts of identifying as trans myself. I have done extensive research on it for years in an attempt to prove to myself that I am definitely not trans, and that I don't have to identify as anything other than my birth gender to be happy. That I can just accept that I am a more masculine female and be happy. But I know that the truth is -- and has been for as long as I have been alive and capable of introspective thought -- if I could, I would 100% choose to wake up tomorrow as the opposite sex.

I have always had an unexplainable desire to wear baggy clothes to hide my breasts (even before I knew about transgender identities) and present as masculine as possible in both looks and actions. This has always been specifically because I subconsciously want people to think that I am boyish -- I don't know where this desire comes from. I have also always, with absolutely no exceptions no matter how hard I tried, preferred to play male characters since I played pretend with my stuffed animals as a preschooler to acting in school musicals as a teenager; I would be extremely uncomfortable playing a feminine character. If I understood why I did these things I would change it in a heartbeat. I struggle with these weird desires and more related ones every day.

But the thought of identifying as transgender scares me more than anything ever has. For one thing, I worry that I am perhaps getting swept up in a social trend. (In the context of a social trend, it is one that I personally find a little overwhelming, and I would probably be uncomfortable with being associated with.) I don't know what I would do if I ended up regretting this later. I also am unsure about my sexuality and worry about the possibility of being a trans man who is also attracted to men. Personally, I don't see anything wrong with that in itself. But the thought of disappointing my parents and family and friends with what could be described as a one-two punch makes me nauseous. And if I transitioned, that means that I would not be able to get with straight males, who are the only people I have ever considered dating. (Yet both of my relationships have ended due to my being uncomfortable, for most likely gender-related reasons that I have tried not to think about.)

The other thought I have is this: if I am being told that I should unapologetically be myself and love myself for who I am, shouldn't I not transition? Shouldn't I just accept that I am not a typically feminine girl and own it and not change anything, rather than transition? This seems logical to me -- yet the subconscious yearning to be seen as male as possible makes this very difficult to carry out.

I have no access to a gender therapist, but even if I did I'm not sure I would go. I am extremely ashamed about the fact that I probably should go see one in the first place.

So... can anyone relate to any of this, or can give me any advice? I've been stuck in this same cycle of thought for about 6 years and I don't know what to do to stop it, but I need it to stop. I can't take it anymore.

And if your answer is that transitioning gives you gender euphoria, isn’t that just the flip side of the same coin? I want to emphasize that by gender dysphoria I mean both social and body dysphoria, and anything else that would fall under “feeling distress at the incongruence between one’s gender identity and one’s sex assigned at birth”.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'What’s it like to be trans without dysphoria?', 'created': 1571784114.0}"

A bit of background first. (Im 17 mtf btw)

I changed to a different doctor a month ago because I moved into a different town and wanted something closer.  (before it was a 2 hour trip)  So they were doing their routine tests, and drew my blood.  They also wanted to check my private area, but we all know that's a big nono, so I refused.  My mom griped at me for it, but I didn't care. 

About a week later the blood results got back.  My doctor claimed my estrogen was way too high even for a female.  But I'm very skeptical of that, since not only do I not notice anything to back that up, but it was very obvious I was trans.  The doctor referred my to an endocrinologist and a month later here I am.

Now to today.

I woke up around 9am  having only slept 6 hours the night before.  I got ready and left around 11am.

The place was very far away, and took over two hours to get to (I live in the middle of nowhere).  But also, my mom got lost more times than I can count, and we got there an hour late.  But they managed to get me in despite that.

So they did the whole questions, height, and weight, and got me with the doctor.

He had a really heavy Indian accent, which I like, and explained a lot of things about hormones that I didnt understand.  He said they would have to do a lot of tests, which I didn't like.

They insisted I have my genitailia inspected, bt again I refused.  I was never informed about this beforehand, and I dont take surprises well, even if good...  They kept on, and my mom kept trying to convince me, but I couldn't.  I hope you all understand, since I think it's common for transpeople to be sensitive about that?  I also have *severe* anxiety issues where just being around others is painful.

About 10 minutes later, and I start crying, unable to convince my mom in my favor.  Of course I should have, and I knew that, but I couldn't do it.  It was humiliating and dehumanizing just to think about it.  

The doctor was really nice, which made me feel bad about refusing, and made sure to inform me he was pro-trans (which is rare af in my country).  Meanwhile my mom was griping me out nonstop.

After a point I just broke.  I went off into my own fantasy land, staring into the corner and blanking out for what may have been hours.  I ignored everything everyone said and did.  Every so often I'd come to, reposition myself a bit, and go right back into my self-imposed solitude.

I did hear at some point that my doctor had lied about having such high estrogen.  The endocrinologist looked over a copy of the blood work and said it was barely abnormal.

Eventually they gave up, and I feel really bad about wasting their time and energy especially since they were so nice.  He just did other tests, like feeling my neck, which I just ignored.  They also did an xray if my hand for some reason and drew blood.  After that I could go.

But I felt horrible after.  Not only do I feel like a piece of shit and a waste of time and resources, and an ungreatful bitch, but I also wasted my whole day for that.  Maybe the blood work they did will do something good, but I'm just fucking screwed.

2019-10-23 04:33:12,dlu5g5,0,5,"I started transitioning june of this year, I was very uncertain and ashamed of myself at first and wasn't out for a while but in early september I came out. Since then I've invested in more fem outfits, worked on makeup, my voice, and pursued hrt and other surgeries. 

I've been out to almost everyone at least everyone excluding my family. Basically I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that my parents will disown me and my life could be at risk at that point. My culture is extremely homophobic and even more so transphobic. 

My father would rather kill me than allow me to transition. I've never had a good relationship with my parents but when my mom came back from being abroad, we got closer. I had crashed her car over the summer and got really hurt. 

During that time I made it my job to get her money from insurance and I did but when she came back we found out that someone had stolen her identity using tax documents from the car. The doors were broken and someone rifled through but we only found out when she cameback stateside and by then it was too late. 

After all the shit I put her through, she told me that no matter what happened no matter what she lost and no matter how depressed she feels, she said that she's grateful to god that she didn't comeback to my body. I couldn't hate anything about her at all, that was the most loving thing I've ever gotten from everyone.

I truly miss my sisters and I miss my mother and I even miss my father. Since then I've done my best to help my mom get her identity and money back, we both paid bills together and took care of each other to rebuild our lives. I've been wanting to get braids for my hair to make me feel less dysphoric but my friends advised me against that because I can't hide braids from my mom and that might lead to issues with our relationship. 

My mom said she would be leaving in January and my friends told me to wait until then but that only makes me sadder. All that means is that one day I will no longer be able to hide myself and I will lose my connection to my family. It hurts the most that I felt so loved near the end. 

I want to toughen my heart and be cold and not care but that's not who I am. The person I was before transition was cold hearted and unhappy, I don't want to be that. What's the point of transitioning if it isn't to be happier, to live a life that is a reflection of who you are. To be loved for who you are. I want to believe that my mom and everyone will still love me but I've grown more doubtful as I see how people in my culture treat me. 

I just want to know why my happiness has to mess up everyone else's happiness? I want to know why I can't have something as simple as hair? Why can't I have what I need to be alive? Why can't I get the space I need to breathe, to even move?

2019-10-23 07:11:11,dlvm7c,6,3,"Hey everyone!

I am a straight, cis, white male. I consider myself an ally, but am recognizing more and more that I don't know much at all about trans issues. This is actually true of a lot of leftist issues, but as someone who is living paycheck to paycheck, I at least have a very base-level grasp of those issues, unlike trans issues which I'm largely ignorant of outside of surface level familiarity that I've managed to gain from my internet habits.

So onto my actual questions. I saw Lindsay Ellis post a thing on Twitter defending Natalie Wynn (of Contrapoints), saying that she didn't always agree with Natalie's views or actions, but that she was her friend, and she wouldn't be bullied into disavowing her.

At first glance, this seems reasonable to me, and actually kind of resonates with me; I struggle with how divisive and self-cannibalistic leftist communities can be sometimes (but not always!) so Lindsay's message of holding someone to account but not casting them out in total spoke to me.

But I also recognize that a lot of the people upset are trans, and knowing that I'm not well-versed in trans issues, I figured I should make an effort to understand. Here's what I do know:

-Natalie is a trans youtuber who speaks to a lot of leftist issues on her channel. My understanding is that she's not always the favorite of the trans community due to various comments she's made. But I don't know much about it.

-She recently featured Buck Angel on her show. He's a trans porn star, but apparently is something called a ""transmedicalist"" or something but I don't know what that means. I'll be googling it after I post this. This guest appearance pissed off the trans community again, I'm guessing because of whatever TM is.

2019-10-23 12:46:50,dlysvj,3,2,"So my cousin and best friend since we were little has always been like the one person I could depend on to understand me, (whether it was my jokes or my sort of goofy attitude) said he ""didn't agree"" when I came out to him. I don't even know what he really meant by that wording but it's pretty clear he doesn't support me in being trans. For background I'm a bit of an introvert, I like hanging out with people but it can be mentally draining to have to try and read social cues but around my cousin I never felt drained. We can communicate on an almost nonverbal level, and just understand eachother most of the time, but now he's rejecting this entire part of me and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm afraid he might never come around and I don't know if I can handle losing a friendship like that. I've always known that he was more conservative than me but I always thought that he would put family over any political beliefs he had. I just feel lost and I don't know what to do.

I seen my doctor today and they prescribed me spiro.

Sorry if that sounded all over the place I'm kinda a mess. I just really hope I can speak femininely consistently in the future and that HRT will he all I need.

2019-10-24 00:36:26,dm8nsk,2,8,"So, I have been feeling really sick lately. Abdominal pain, nausea, meteorism. I went to a gastroenterologist to, well, have a check up and see what's wrong. I enter the room and she starts speaking. ""hello - mr deadname-, how may I  help you?"" I kindly greet her,  and correct her, explaining that i am trans, and I am on HRT, then I explainedwhat I was feeling.  She interrupted me and asked ""HRT? What for?"". I stared at her, dumbfounded, and said ""because I an trans?"" she replied with an ok and told me to keep explaining her.

Once I was done explaining, she told me that it was the hormones' fault. Like, she didn't even checked me or asked if I had an ultrasound, a tomography  or a blood test (which I had because I was hospitalized because of the abdominal pain). I told her that there was no way that was possible because I spoke with my endocrinologyst and he told me - TL;DR - hormones have nothing to do with what I am feeling, and all my organs are perfectly fine, so I shouldn't worry.

She gave me a special diet called ""FODMAP"" for 15 days, and told me to take ezomepasol before breakfast.

One week later, I visited her again, told her that I have beem strictly following her instructions, but still felt sick.and after she felt my abdomen, she told me AGAIN that it was the hormones' fault and told me to go see a therapist.

Okay, so I stayed calm and told her again it has nothing to do with the hormones. So she told me I had to do a feces exam and an endoscopy.(I had to stop taking hormones for three days and let me add, I felt as bad as always.)

Today, I went so they could do the endoscopy. Once the exam was done and I woke up from the sedation, the doctor told me that I was fine, that the organs were fine and that I had to wait for the results for the H. Pilori. 
And guess what? she said that it was most likely the HORMONES' FAULT AGAIN. AND THAT I SHOULD GO SEE A THERAPIST.

2019-10-24 04:25:35,dmb9rv,5,2,"I'm honestly so over the amount of judgement within the trans community.  Specifically, the trans masc community (I can't speak for what goes on in trans femme groups).  There is so much judgement and hyper criticism of how other trans masc people go about their transition, how masculine or not they choose to present, their choice to birth or not birth children.  It gets pretty old.  

If you join a group for binary trans men or straight trans men it's almost a guarantee that the group will be 95% insecure guys fairly early on in their journey shitting on the choices of other trans masc people.  They will claim that these ""not really trans"" or ""not adequately trans"" trans people are the reason cis people hate us, or are the reason for gate-keeping, or whatever new bullshit they've come up with to hate on other trans people.  I always want to ask them:  ""Do you want trans care to go back to what it was until about a decade or so ago, when you had to be the most hetero, the most masculine, your mannerisms, voice patterns had to be perfect or you didn't ""want it enough""? Some of you likely wouldn't meet that criteria.  Is it about legitimizing yourself to cis people? If they don't understand trans people they aren't gonna understand you unless you have a specific narrow narrative that not even all binary trans people have. Do you think it's gonna make you money or get you famous? ...LOL Do you believe that people should get an opinion on YOUR identity? No? So why do you think that you should get an opinion on other people's identities?""

Maybe it's because I've been around the community for nearly 15 years, 10 of that in transition but it's old and tiring.  I'll be honest, I used to be like that, I tried to police people, I was a bully, I was an asshole, and being that person I was being, a lot of the self hatred I had, it wasn't able to escape, because I was living a life of hatred. I couldn't heal myself because I was too worried about what everyone else was doing. Once I learned to let go that belief, realize that other people living their lives fully and happily wasn't impacting me, and moved away from the toxic communities I was in, where we were all feeding on each other's hatred, I became a different person. Lateral aggression in marginalized communities is a real issue. We spend so much time being shit on by the majority that we feel like the rest of the community aren't doing their part, they aren't playing the game of being an X minority right, ""if trans people would just x, y, z then cis people wouldn't be so shitty to us."" That's not true, see my earlier point. There are always going to be people that dislike us because we are trans and they feel it's abnormal/unnatural/sin/fake/etc. You have to learn that other people are going to do what they do regardless of what you think, so holding onto negative feelings towards other trans people because they don't meet your expectations isn't healthy and is actually damaging to you, not only due to the physical effects of stress and anger, but socially as well.

We FaceTime, Talk on the phone, text, snapchat, DM etc. We live 2 hours away from one another. He’s a trans Male (female to male) and I’m a Cis Female. We met online and he identified as a male. I didn’t know he was born a woman...... still in pre transition. &gt;


Anyway as of lately things have not been the best. We can’t talk without having a serious conversation. I like to call it arguing because he’s not listening and I’m forcing an explanation to somethings I shouldn’t have too. He is still a virgin and I’m not. I talked about waiting to have sex until he completely transitioned. Not because of me not being comfortable with him having a vagina (which I am) but because he thinks sex will keep me in a relationship. To me he doesn’t sound ready at all or comfortable with himself. Saying he wants to stay fully clothed and not allowing me to touch him. When I brought the suggestion up he completely went into a “why are you with me” conversation. Saying things like “if you know I’ll never be good enough why be with me?”. Or when I try to explain what I mean he begins to get sarcastic saying things like “congratulations you were born with the parts your comfortable with.” Or “your sooooo lucky to be who you feel you are.” 

I completely support my boyfriends decisions with everything he does. Not once have I intentionally or ever tried to make him feel less than a man. I don’t see him as anything else. When I mentioned to him that I was just getting tired of the back and forth and just needed to maybe take a break he said it’s his”dysphoria”. When he says things or does things that are d***ish he blames it all on his dysphoria. He tells me to treat him like a normal guy and I try but to be honest any normal guy would have already gotten a we’re over text. 

I really love my boyfriend. (Yes even though we haven’t physically met) I just think that maybe he doesn’t understand how draining it is to deal with smart remarks or argumentative comments. Even when I tell him I love him he asks me “am I sure” or “do you really love me”. I tell him and show him as much as I can that I do and I don’t mind repeating myself but 6 times in a 2 minute conversation is a bit much. He likes to say it’s “reassurance”. I’m already stressed between work and school and he is my only safe place to relax and just enjoy my time but it’s starting to become just another dreadful task. Im not sure if this is normal or if maybe I should try and take a break in our relationship or what. One thing I do know is that it’s pushing me away.

2019-10-25 06:55:00,dmtmq4,0,1,"Tonight has been a rollercoaster of a ride. Hold on while I give you the long story.

When I was a little kid, I grew my hair out long and pretended to be a girl. I liked it better and felt like people were nicer to me. I exclusively hung out with girls, and was always labeled as too “sensitive” or “passive”. I can’t tell you how many discussions I had in elementary school with my parents that ended in “man up” or “stop being so sensitive”. 

I kept my hair long through middle school, but was bullied pretty badly. Went I entered into high school I still looked very androgynous and people mistook me for a girl all the time.

Everything changed my sophomore year. I ended up with some very masculine friends I found playing sports, and ended up with a girlfriend. I cut my hair very short and started dressing with flannels and jeans and typical menswear. At this time I felt like I needed to adopt a sexist attitude towards women to “fit” the male mold. I’m not proud of that at all, but toxic masculinity really pushed me into that space. I ended up very depressed. I became suicidal senior year. I had to get a circumcision at 17 for medical reasons and I remember wishing that they could have taken the whole thing.

Then I moved out of my conservative hometown. I started spending time with people who weren’t crushed into gender roles and really didn’t seem to “care” about their gender... they just lived. I remember cross dressing there at parties a few times and feeling so free about it. I realized at this point that I was bisexual. My body dysmorphia continued at this point and I felt uncomfortable with having male genitalia. The (as I just learned) famous “button” question  would be a daily occurrence. 

Tonight I was browsing the internet as one does and stumbled across r/egg_irl. I guess some of the posts really resonated (I know, this is ironic, it’s a meme subreddit) with me and I started questioning.

Questioning everything.

And I realized: all these years, ever since I was a little kid I haven’t fit into this male model. Biologically speaking I don’t feel like I have body dysmorphia to the degree many individuals in the trans community do, but I certainly wish my gender was physically different. And I most certainly have never fit into what is socially or psychosexually male. 

A huge lightbulb has gone off in my head. I don’t know if I’m trans or just gender curious, but I do know that I am going to go out tomorrow and buy a beautiful dress (I’ve always loved the idea of dresses) and wear it around the house. I’m gonna try makeup. I’m gonna give myself a damn close shave. I’m going to walk around like I always do and not care about the “feminine gait” comments I always get. 

This is so exciting, and scary at the same time. This is one of the first nights I’m going to fall asleep NOT in a depressive mess and I’m so glad for it.

Hopefully I can talk to my psychologist about this revelation soon. I want to make sure this is about body positivity and not the sexual shame I’ve experienced in my past. 

I am very confused but also very happy and I thought I would share. Have any of you had similar “epiphany” moments like this?

Most of the time im incredibly feminine but i do have short periods where i feel less feminine and i will act and be less feminine. Im only out to 3 people at the minute none of which are my family so transitioning could be fairly difficult because i live in a small town so when i start properly transitioning word will spread between former freinds and former classmates. Im trying to subtly hint that im trans to my family by attempting to feminise my voice (it still needs so much work), wearing more androgynous or feminine clothes and wanting to have really long flowy and frankly feminine hair but im scared to come out to my mum. Not because she might not accept me but because throughout me figuring myself out ive told her im genderfluid about a year ago and i only the other week told her im nonbinary but since then with the help of reddit and my freind ive realised that im a trans girl. I initially said i was nonbinary because i was still figuring myself out and i was just using it as a wide term showing that im definately not a cis guy (ewwww the thought of that makes me feel ill) and i knew i was leaning towards the heavily feminine side of the gender spectrum. I had a really in depth and understanding conversation with my trans freind who has transitioned (hi jamie if your reading this) which started by me saying that i think i might be trans and ended with me being reassured that what i was feeling wasnt weird but was just who i am. Another thing thats making me not want to come out to my family is that i havent found a name that suits me yet and i want to wait but it would mean waiting longer to be evaluated for hrt. 

What do i do. Im having a bit of a breakdown about this right now and thought i'd turn to all my fellow trans and trans allies for help.

2019-10-26 05:44:13,dn9slo,13,0,"As a trans woman, I watched the premiere of Watchmen with some interest to see if we were represented; and if so, how so.

There were certainly many clues that some of the characters may be transgendered; and many subtle sex jokes.  There are many allusions throughout the first episode to voyeurism, from the little body staring through the hole in the wood (""wood""), to the numerous references to ""watching"" (""who watches the watchers?  we watch."" or ""WATCH this boy"", ""WATCHmen""), fisting jokes (""give me five"" etc), etc.

The only character I can say pretty definitively is trans would be Sister Night.  She more or less openly states so in the classroom with allusions to bottom surgery, (""The doctors had to pull me apart to get out the ""bullet"").  This has necessitated adoption, which is why, unlike her and her husband, the kids are not African American.  Note the squid poster in the background during this scene.  Also note the discussion of ""eggs""; quite apart from egg white representing semen, pretrans women often refer to themselves as ""eggs"", because once they hatch they become ""chicks"".  She works in a ""bakery"", which is a place where there is a ""bun in the oven"".  She carries rosary beads, but they are obviously refashioned anal beads.  During the scene in which numerous cows are shot, keep in mind that cows produce milk; these symbolize the destruction of her reproductive capacity.  She refers to her nose for ""white"" supremacy, which smells like ""bleach"", although she certainly won't be producing any without her ""bullet"".

&amp;#x200B;

I also consider the possibility that the sheriff is a trans man.  There are numerous subtle behavioral cues, but I like most of all the fact that he is the only police officer to not wear a mask.  Since he has taken his off (""come out""), he refuses to ever wear one again.  He has become a ""hung"" man.  Where he tells his officer to pull down the mask, he refers to it as a ""face""; this is an indication that he spent a long, long time in the closet, so long that his own mask became his face until he took it off for good.

&amp;#x200B;

For the mask colors, it may be instructive for you to look up the 70s hanky code.  It is no accident that Panda is ""dirty"".

&amp;#x200B;

Sister Night's code is 1985.  Apart from the obvious, this is certainly revealing; I hope my cleverer readers can answer this one?  She also mispronounces ""cavalry"" as ""calvary""; whereas the former is a military unit, calvary is where a man was penetrated with wood.

&amp;#x200B;

The show has constant allusions to the race against time for transition.  As trans women like me know, every day waited past puberty delays the success of ""passing"".  Even the Cavalry shout, ""TICK TOCK"" in their video.  But see also the ""Minutemen"" ad, ""The countdown ends"" etc.  The Cavalry deftly point out the position of transgendered people in society, ""We are invisible"" and even put in a penis joke ""HOSED out"".

&amp;#x200B;

I have numerous more examples but I don't want to become too prolix.  However, the show has made me prouder to be a transwoman than any other media I have consumed and I am very excited for the second episode.

{TL;DR: I identify more with the female gender, but am horrified of the medical dangers of transitioning and the long term effects. I've found that identifying as non-binary has brought me some ease, but I fear that I may just be suppressing my dysphoria again as I have for the last 14 years.}

 I cannot relate to my male anatomy, and I feel a strong sense of gender euphoria when associating with the female gender. I also feel somewhat at ease or at peace when associating with neither, however, there is less euphoria with this.

Now here's my predicament, I feel that my dysphoria strengthens when associating with the female gender while not physically being female. I have not transitioned in any way shape or form, and I am personally scared to do such. The reason being is that I feel like I'd be harming my body (mainly with HRT), and thus myself, to me there is no difference. I personally cannot bring myself to do anything that I know would harm myself. 

I know there are ways to treat certain problems that can arise with HRT, but there is so little information on long term effects and quite frankly I don't want to take that risk. Still I do not feel comfortable with my male anatomy, I never have. 

I have found that utilizing They/Them pronouns has been an easier route, it isn't perfect, but it is still better than being called he/him. I do not relate as strongly with the non-binary gender as I do the female gender, but this seems to be slightly easier on my mental health for now.

2019-10-27 01:47:51,dnn3dg,5,4,"I’m almost 17 and I’m assigned female at birth. 
For the past 4+ years I’ve wished to be someone that I’m not. 
For a year or so, I went by a different name by two of my friends, which was actually rarely used, sadly. 
For the majority of the past 4 years, I’ve been wearing men’s clothes and wearing men’s deodorant. 
I try to deepen my voice, make my presence bigger and carry myself and sit like a man. 
I cut my hair as short as my mother would allow me to, which was only to the length of my shoulders and no higher. 

On a regular basis, I dream that people think I’m just a man. That’s it. They don’t suspect that I’m originally a woman, they just think ‘oh hey that’s a male man doing his job in male guys clothes’ and that’s it.
That’s the dream. 

Being Bi hasn’t really made the gender questioning harder. It’s just Bi. So I don’t have to worry about saying straight or gay. Besides when I’m with family. With them they think I’m 100% into manly men. Menly man. 

So you’ve read those 3 paragraphs. It seems pretty simple and straightforward, right? I’m totally trans. Male through and through as much as I can get away with while living with my family. But what if I told you that right now, at this very moment, I’m in bed with mascara smudged under my eyes like a panda because I couldn’t be bothered wiping my makeup off for one night. 

What if I told you that since I started sixth form, I’ve been wearing makeup more often, being a makeup model for family and colleges and I’ve been getting more womanly clothing in my wardrobes. 
I’m going by my original name, but as a double barrel too, so my name is extra girly. Different, but the same. 
I look in the mirror with my makeup on, feeling better about myself because I hate my face and my body and the only way I can feel a little better about myself is to slap on some heavy contour and concealer and lipstick and just smile at myself and everyone around me. 

Fake it until you make it. 

My longer hair is a nuisance, but I still style it for it to go over my semi-flat chest so people don’t notice how small it is. I don’t bind. My body just doesn’t like carrying boobage. 

And the thing is, I don’t know if that’s a curse or a blessing. 

I’m asking for perfume and makeup for Christmas. I’m trying to get push up bra’s to woo boys but then deny them because it would be amusing. (A dick move but boys my age just think about sex so who cares). 

So you’ve read the recent few paragraphs. So clearly, I was just a confused teenager and I’m slowly confirming to the roles and expectations of my assigned gender. 
I mean, it’s still happening their very moment. Makeup, pink pyjamas and painted nails with the remnants of my  perfume still barely hanging in the air. 

You can’t see the problem here, the whole gender ordeal has sorted itself out, I’m clearly born and mentally supposed to be a woman. I mean, that would be lovely but that’s not exactly what’s going on here. 
The whole girly makeup cisgender ordeal only started last month in September. But still, it’s sorted out, right?

Well there’s this feeling I have. 
Right now, I’m me, Marcey*. Right now I’m a woman. Me. I’m a whole person. 
But I feel this tugging in my heart when I see men that the Markus* me resembles closely to in my minds eye. 

I feel a connection and a deep understanding when I see posts, stories and videos of ftm people. I know their struggles with it. But I don’t. 

For about 4-5 years I’ve been... someone else. That someone else is Mark. He was trans, came out to my friends and controlled my day to day life because he was me and he was part of my mind. You get me?

While he was there, I was sat inside my head on a chair. I could see the world and everything Mark was doing and saying but it was through a glass window. Everything was muffled too, because of the glass window which was my eyes. 
I was unaware of this, just accepting my place in the basic void. I was in and out of it throughout my whole life anyways. 

For some reason, 2 years ago I became self aware. I saw me sitting in my chair watching Marks actions and the consequences that followed. I watched the self harm he caused and heard his internal arguments on whether he should just end this vessel’s life or not. It was tough. 

He tried to bind with sports bras and he’s the one that tried to pass as a guy as much as he could without the family being suspicious. 

He was just another depressed, suicidal, reckless and confused trans kid. He needed support and to this day we still have none.

But since February 2019, this has all been getting better. I’ve been taking more control, we’ve been clean since Feb 27th and I took proper and full control in September. 

It’s been hard to be one person in one body bur it’s been worth it. I’ve been healthier and my friend has told me I seem happier. I’ve only actually felt real happiness for the first time this year when the depression finally lifted. 
(And yes, I’ve never actually been able to experience actual true happiness even in childhood because of reasons that I don’t want to share but trust me I’ve been in a depressed haze and I haven’t known who I am since early early childhood. Like at 4 years old. Y’know, the age where you don’t know who you are and don’t have a personality anyways? Yeah try try tell me that once upon a time I wasn’t damaged because honey, I’ve always been damaged and no I’m not being an edgy bitch, I seriously mean that I’ve been fucked up for literally all of my life.)

Anyways, yeah. Since I’ve been actually me for the first time truly ever, I’m seriously good. 

Back to the original question; am I transgender? 

Even as my cisgender self, I share the same dream and hopes and being and passing as male but I’m okay with who I am at the moment. 

I can feel him starting to come back though. Slowly. It’s odd and I hate it. I used to be so paranoid all the time thinking that people were watching and spying on me. I used to see and feel demons in my home. I used to see walls melt and people fade to the background as the bus I was on was submerged in dark water. 
I don’t want to be messed up again. 

Anyways, what’s your verdict on the matter? 
Trans? Not trans?

This has been my TED Talk. 
Thanks for reading and sticking all the way though.",trans,What even is this; a confusing trans talk,1572166071.0,"{'created_utc': 1572140871, 'id': 'dnn3dg', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 4, 'selftext': 'I’m almost 17 and I’m assigned female at birth. \nFor the past 4+ years I’ve wished to be someone that I’m not. \nFor a year or so, I went by a different name by two of my friends, which was actually rarely used, sadly. \nFor the majority of the past 4 years, I’ve been wearing men’s clothes and wearing men’s deodorant. \nI try to deepen my voice, make my presence bigger and carry myself and sit like a man. \nI cut my hair as short as my mother would allow me to, which was only to the length of my shoulders and no higher. \n\nOn a regular basis, I dream that people think I’m just a man. That’s it. They don’t suspect that I’m originally a woman, they just think ‘oh hey that’s a male man doing his job in male guys clothes’ and that’s it.\nThat’s the dream. \n\nBeing Bi hasn’t really made the gender questioning harder. It’s just Bi. So I don’t have to worry about saying straight or gay. Besides when I’m with family. With them they think I’m 100% into manly men. Menly man. \n\nSo you’ve read those 3 paragraphs. It seems pretty simple and straightforward, right? I’m totally trans. Male through and through as much as I can get away with while living with my family. But what if I told you that right now, at this very moment, I’m in bed with mascara smudged under my eyes like a panda because I couldn’t be bothered wiping my makeup off for one night. \n\nWhat if I told you that since I started sixth form, I’ve been wearing makeup more often, being a makeup model for family and colleges and I’ve been getting more womanly clothing in my wardrobes. \nI’m going by my original name, but as a double barrel too, so my name is extra girly. Different, but the same. \nI look in the mirror with my makeup on, feeling better about myself because I hate my face and my body and the only way I can feel a little better about myself is to slap on some heavy contour and concealer and lipstick and just smile at myself and everyone around me. \n\nFake it until you make it. \n\nMy longer hair is a nuisance, but I still style it for it to go over my semi-flat chest so people don’t notice how small it is. I don’t bind. My body just doesn’t like carrying boobage. \n\nAnd the thing is, I don’t know if that’s a curse or a blessing. \n\nI’m asking for perfume and makeup for Christmas. I’m trying to get push up bra’s to woo boys but then deny them because it would be amusing. (A dick move but boys my age just think about sex so who cares). \n\nSo you’ve read the recent few paragraphs. So clearly, I was just a confused teenager and I’m slowly confirming to the roles and expectations of my assigned gender. \nI mean, it’s still happening their very moment. Makeup, pink pyjamas and painted nails with the remnants of my  perfume still barely hanging in the air. \n\nYou can’t see the problem here, the whole gender ordeal has sorted itself out, I’m clearly born and mentally supposed to be a woman. I mean, that would be lovely but that’s not exactly what’s going on here. \nThe whole girly makeup cisgender ordeal only started last month in September. But still, it’s sorted out, right?\n\nWell there’s this feeling I have. \nRight now, I’m me, Marcey*. Right now I’m a woman. Me. I’m a whole person. \nBut I feel this tugging in my heart when I see men that the Markus* me resembles closely to in my minds eye. \n\nI feel a connection and a deep understanding when I see posts, stories and videos of ftm people. I know their struggles with it. But I don’t. \n\nFor about 4-5 years I’ve been... someone else. That someone else is Mark. He was trans, came out to my friends and controlled my day to day life because he was me and he was part of my mind. You get me?\n\nWhile he was there, I was sat inside my head on a chair. I could see the world and everything Mark was doing and saying but it was through a glass window. Everything was muffled too, because of the glass window which was my eyes. \nI was unaware of this, just accepting my place in the basic void. I was in and out of it throughout my whole life anyways. \n\nFor some reason, 2 years ago I became self aware. I saw me sitting in my chair watching Marks actions and the consequences that followed. I watched the self harm he caused and heard his internal arguments on whether he should just end this vessel’s life or not. It was tough. \n\nHe tried to bind with sports bras and he’s the one that tried to pass as a guy as much as he could without the family being suspicious. \n\nHe was just another depressed, suicidal, reckless and confused trans kid. He needed support and to this day we still have none.\n\nBut since February 2019, this has all been getting better. I’ve been taking more control, we’ve been clean since Feb 27th and I took proper and full control in September. \n\nIt’s been hard to be one person in one body bur it’s been worth it. I’ve been healthier and my friend has told me I seem happier. I’ve only actually felt real happiness for the first time this year when the depression finally lifted. \n(And yes, I’ve never actually been able to experience actual true happiness even in childhood because of reasons that I don’t want to share but trust me I’ve been in a depressed haze and I haven’t known who I am since early early childhood. Like at 4 years old. Y’know, the age where you don’t know who you are and don’t have a personality anyways? Yeah try try tell me that once upon a time I wasn’t damaged because honey, I’ve always been damaged and no I’m not being an edgy bitch, I seriously mean that I’ve been fucked up for literally all of my life.)\n\nAnyways, yeah. Since I’ve been actually me for the first time truly ever, I’m seriously good. \n\nBack to the original question; am I transgender? \n\nEven as my cisgender self, I share the same dream and hopes and being and passing as male but I’m okay with who I am at the moment. \n\nI can feel him starting to come back though. Slowly. It’s odd and I hate it. I used to be so paranoid all the time thinking that people were watching and spying on me. I used to see and feel demons in my home. I used to see walls melt and people fade to the background as the bus I was on was submerged in dark water. \nI don’t want to be messed up again. \n\nAnyways, what’s your verdict on the matter? \nTrans? Not trans?\n\nThis has been my TED Talk. \nThanks for reading and sticking all the way though.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'What even is this; a confusing trans talk', 'created': 1572166071.0}"

But the other day I had a discussion where someone made me out to feel like a bigot. The basic premise of my point of that discussion?

That I feel nowadays people are conflating personality traits and personal ways of expressing themselves as genders or sexualities when it would just be easier to...not do that. 

So essentially what I mean is that I don’t personally subscribe to the idea that there are “over 76 different” genders. 

If you were born male but identify as female, that’s fine. Great. Do you. Vice versa? Awesome. 

 But if you were born male but don’t identify as male but also don’t identify as female but also identify as both but only a little bit more fem than masc but sometimes neither, that’s not a “gender”.  That’s just YOU.  And I think it’s undermining to the plight of the transgender community when people start bickering over something as simple as penis vs vaginas/ what makes someone a gender. 

I feel that applying a label to everything requires way more time and effort than anyone should even be allowing.  This convo came about partly because I was saying that while I am bisexual and have feminine tendencies I’ve never really felt i identify as a woman even though I would be into things like wearing high heels or traditionally female clothing. I was told to consider that maybe my gender is so this/that and I should explore that I’m possibly something mildly in between male/female.

No matter how much I try I can’t seem to ignore it, distract myself, or do anything about it. 
I talk on a weekly/biweekly basis with a college therapist about various things but have never mentioned the dysphoria.

2019-10-28 04:23:11,do3zhf,6,13,"Hi, folks. In the last few weeks, I've been thinking about some aspects of my sexuality and identity, and some doubts arose in the process.

A background: I'm a young man who has never been uncomfortable with my male body and identity. However, since I was a kid, I had the odd feeling that it was somehow weird I wasn't a girl. It's not easy to explain, but I've always thought that I would fit more neatly into a female body. This feeling never disappeared. It's not that I don't feel I'm a man, but I've always felt that, if I had the option, I'd rather be born as a woman. Since I was a boy, when I was home alone, I'd borrow some clothes and lipsticks from my mom and wear them. It felt good. I didn't know the word crossdressing back then, but when I first heard it, I immediately said to myself this is what I am, a crossdresser. There have been some years since I last wore female clothes, but I've decided that, when I live alone or have my own family, I will buy both male and female clothes. And no, crossdressing does not have any sexual connotation to me, I just feel good when I do it. Sometimes I think about how it would be like to transition. It is not something I really want to do, but I have some pleasure imagining how my life as a woman would be. At some point, I started to think a little bit more seriously about transitioning (since I like to imagine it a lot), but I have come to the conclusion that, to me, the drawbacks of the process would far outweigh the benefits, since I'm not really uncomfortable with being a male.

Nevertheless, despite all these feelings, I had never thought I might be transgender until now. To me, a transgender was necessarily someone with strong dysphoria. And I thought transgender and transsexual were synonymous. But I've been reading more about trans people because a close friend of mine came out of the closet as a trans man. I said to her (I'm using ""her"" because she still uses female pronouns) that I kinda get what she feels because I have this feeling that it was somehow strange not being a woman. This is not the same as being trans, I said to her, but I think I have a glimpse of your feelings. But after that, I started to question myself. Maybe being cis or being trans isn't something binary, I reasoned; maybe there is a spectrum between being a 100% cis or a 100% trans, and I'm closer to the cis end, but not totally cis. I don't know if it makes any sense, or if it sounds right to trans people. In a Reddit thread, I saw a trans person saying they believe that, contrary to what most people (trans folks included) believe, gender dysphoria is not a precondition for being trans. Maybe I'm a trans person without dysphoria, I said to myself. And then I discovered that transgender and transsexual are not the same, that transgender is an umbrella term with a wider meaning than transsexual.

So, I've decided to consult trans people, to see what they think about my situation.

My younger brother just came out to me as MtF. It’s not the first time we’ve discussed this (a conversation happened last year) but he had said things had changed and he no longer felt that way. However, I got a text this morning from him telling me how he’s feeling now.

I responded by saying that I’d be there if he needed to talk, and that his happiness is what matters most in this situation (as we talked about our parents’ reaction). While we’re best friends, we’ve never really had that “outwardly loving” sibling relationship, so that’s the way I’ve told him I’m there for him. 

I’m just wondering how else to proceed, and what are things you wish had been said/done when you came out to family members. Even though I had some ideas about this, it’s still a bit of a surprise (especially to get as a text, I guess). It’s kind of hard too since I’m away from home right now, and will be until Christmas time (like, across the ocean away).

Even using he/him pronouns in this post seems weird - please excuse that, I’ll make adjustments in the future! But really, I just wanted to reach out to the trans community and get some insight. What are the best ways to be supportive and validating as a sibling?

2019-10-28 13:33:25,do8w4m,1,1,"So, I'm not really a regular on reddit, I just made this account now because I wanted to ask a question in a trans-oriented community and this was the only one that sprang to mind. I'm a 22 year old pre-HRT transgirl (I plan on starting HRT in January when my medical benefits kick in) who first became aware of dysphoric feelings and made the decision to start transitioning last January.

I wasn't able to sleep last night, so I spent most of it watching Thought Slime videos, and in the last one I watched he related a personal anecdote about a mental illness-related experience which he previously thought to be a uniquely shameful aspect of his personality, only to have a friend offhandedly mention that it's actually a pretty common occurrence among people with mental illness and was nothing to apologize about or feel ashamed over, and what he related struck a bit of a chord with me about a particular pattern in my own experiences over the past 9 months or so (which is to say, since I initially identified the emotions I've been feeling as being dysphoric)

Essentially there seems to be a sort of irregular cycle where I'll feel really intensely dysphoric for a while, and then it'll recede and I feel mostly alright for a while, to the point that I can hardly remember what it felt like to get hit with the dysphoria stick like that, until it inevitably happens again

The thing is when I hit the ""feeling okay"" part of that cycle, there's a part of me that feels, like, embarrassed or guilty, like maybe I'm blowing this whole thing out of proportion since clearly I'm capable of functioning fine at least part of the time in my current state, and at times I'll start to doubt the legitimacy of my dysphoric phases

Obviously on a rational level I know this is absurd, especially since there's such a clear pattern of the dysphoria returning eventually, but it's just this irrational feeling down in my subsconscious that I'm somehow less of a ""real"" transgirl because of these periods of feeling kind of okay; What I'm curious about is whether anyone here has had a similar experience?

I am a cis hetero middle school Spanish teacher who is very LGBT friendly, but admittedly I am a newbie when it comes to certain things. Today in class, one of my students disclosed to me privately (and with much trepidation, bless him!)  that he is in the closet FTM trans. He felt the need to tell me because we are doing a project on personality traits and adjectives in Spanish have gender, so he wanted to know if he could submit his project privately and have permission to use masculine adjectives. 

The initial interaction was quite brief as it occurred at the end of class, but I quietly told him that of course he may do the assignment this way. I smiled and that was it. I walked out of class with a bit of a shock to the system as I was not expecting him to tell me this and I was incredibly touched that he felt he could bring this to me. 

During my planning period, I reached out asking for him to see me at the end of the day. I discretely pulled him out of study hall and told him that I wanted to follow up about what he had told me. I asked him if he was out as I assumed he was not. He confirmed this and so I told him I will continue to use female pronouns and his current name so as not to tip off his fellow students and teachers and that was mostly the extent of the conversation. However I am now thinking it is very probable his parents/the school counselors do not know about his being trans and so I think it would be good if I could find some online resources for a student his age. He is in the 8th grade. Of course I will do my part to be a support system but I do not have many trans people in my life and do not at all feel an authority on the subject.

2019-10-30 02:34:23,dp0nty,15,3,"Hello! I am a straight woman and I have been wondering why are trans people trans? 

Disclaimer!!!
I genuinely do not know anything about the trans community except the difference between a trans Male and trans female so I DO NOT mean to offend anyone with my question I would just like some insight and understanding. I am not looking for a debate or to bait anyone or anything like that so with that being said here are my questions:

1)Basically I want to know why someone would become transgender...so for instance if a woman decides to become a man are they doing it because they dont like the rules their society has placed on female and male roles? But then how does that differ from a tomboy and just saying you dont like the things typically associated with a woman?

Would trans people exist if we lived in a world without gender roles?

2) What is the purpose of surgery and or hormones?

2019-10-30 05:00:53,dp277m,7,6,"Hi. My name is wren, and I'm 16. I'm MtF and came out to my parents around 7 or 8 months ago, but I was speaking to my therapist about it in January and have felt this way for a long time. When I came out to my mom and dad, I sent them a 12 paragraph email explaining what gender dysphoria was, and how it affected me day to day. I have done my best to educate them (mainly my mom) about hormone blockers, socially transitioning, and ways of alleviating dysphoria. When explaining why I was telling them now rather than some other time, I said that my body image issues and feeling like I was in the wrong set of skin was getting in the way of me being happy. That it was important to me, urgent, and something that I couldn't afford to not address.

I was struggling with depression a lot last year, and this year, things seemed to get a little better. But I was still just scraping by and taking things day to day. As a result of that along with my gender identity stuff, my parents sent me to a therapeutic wilderness program. They, along with my ed consultant decided that it would be the ""best therapeutic fit"" for me to be placed in the male group, even though I was presenting as and identifying as female. It ended up being a wonderful growing experience for me. All of the staff, and pretty much all of the students, were extremely supportive and were able to create an environment where I felt welcome. It did feel more than a little invalidating being the only girl in the group though.

After 3 months in wilderness, I was transitioned to a Residential Treatment Center in Utah. It was pretty good at addressing gender dysphoria, and allowed for students to stay in the dorm that aligned with their gender identity. But my parents and ed consultant chose to place me in a male dorm again. It felt heartbreaking to me, because I was surrounded by people who were wondering why I wasn't in the girls dorm. There were like 3 trans guys on my hall who were allowed to start on the male dorm.

I talked to my therapist there, Phyllis, about it and she said, ""I don't know why you are in the male dorm. I would have expected you to start on Rise (the female/ nonbinary dorm) but your parents must not have pushed for it."" 

I was also told by my parents that they felt they couldn't safely lead me down the path of transitioning, and that anything with hormones would be put on hold for a little while. 

I got pulled out of that place after a few weeks (average stay is a year) because of physical sexual harassment and intimidation. One of the guys ended up jumping me and busting my lip open while his friend taunted and called me a faggot. A few days after that people were making fun of me for how I got my ass kicked. I ended up telling my parents that I couldn't take it anymore, and that I was going to kill myself if I had to be tormented every day. 

Now I've been home for around a month. Even though my experience at a residential was awful, I've been able to start getting back on my feet again pretty quickly. Wilderness has really stuck with me, and I love carving spoons and knives, along with helping my father with trapping and making a fire pit to cook on. But one glaring thing is still stressing me out.

My family just isn't there yet. While my mom is trying, and her side of the family has been surprisingly supportive, my sister doesn't even want to be seen with me. She wont call me Wren or she/her, because she feels like she's loosing her big brother. No matter how much I tell her that I've always had her back, that I'm the same person I've always been, and that I'll continue to love and support her no matter what. She still can't accept it. She's afraid of having her friends find out about me, and it hurts like nothing has ever hurt before.

And my parents still haven't even scheduled an appointment with an endocrinologist. We live in West Virginia, so traveling plus the six month wait can be a pain, but knowing that it's not even being worked on drives me up the wall. I feel like they're just expecting me to sit here and grow a beard and one day say that I'm not trans anymore. Hell, I've had a full psychological evaluation where the psychiatrist was hammering in the message that I am genuinely identifying as female and that it's not something that I can help. BUT THEY STILL WONT TREAT MY LIKE I'M THEIR DAUGHTER. I'm not mad at them, I'm just frustrated with the situation. Because it feels like everything just goes in one ear and out the other, and that they're never actually going to see me as female. 

If they actually believed me, why would they be worried about even starting me on blockers? It should have been LITERALLY THE FIRST THING that they did after having the appointment with my therapist in March where I came out to them and she explained that I have gender dysphoric disorder. It's so irresponsible to put me in a position where I'm looking down the barrel of irreversible changes that I don't want to have happen to me. I could get it if they weren't comfortable blindly rushing down the road of HRT without sperm banking first. That's okay and I understand it. I can even understand their anxiety around the current situation. 

I love my parents so much, and at the same time they are putting me through the most stressful limbo imaginable. I'm sorry for ranting. I just really need some virtual hugs, and people telling me that they have been in the same place.

A KY state representative is trying to prevent transgender children from being able to obtain the healthcare that they need with blatant misinformation about the case that happened with Luna, the 7yr old trans child who was shoved into the media and made a political pawn for right-wing news organizations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where we come in, I do NOT at all condone harassment or any sort of pointed or angry language at this woman. We need to explain ourselves in a way that isn't accusatory or hateful.

&amp;#x200B;

All we need to tell her is;

&amp;#x200B;

1)What our childhood was like growing up as trans\* and seeing the changes that happened to our bodies,

&amp;#x200B;

2) Why transgender youth need medical transition available to prevent suicide in kids who are denied the chance to prevent a mentally damaging puberty.

Link articles with statistics if you can.

&amp;#x200B;

3) If you have time, write about Luna and how her case was distorted by news organizations. You can watch a video about Luna's case here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvjHn6QEgh4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvjHn6QEgh4)

2019-10-31 02:05:09,dpgxlp,0,3,"Hi, I’m Sarah. I’ve always been positive that I was a girl. I was always aware that people could be trans and I always questioned “what does it even feel like to be *blank*?” It never occurred to me that I could be anything other than a girl. And it stayed that way until about 11 months ago. Around that time I realized hmmm, I don’t like my chest. When I tried on clothes they always stuck out somehow. They felt wrong and suffocating. (Is that dysphoria?) It’s not a consistent feeling though, it comes and goes. I ended up getting a binder and I cried when I first put it on. And from there they just kept coming. 

I wasn’t sure if I liked my name. Or even my pronouns. I was so positive that I was a girl and then it just hit me. Am I? I was thinking maybe I’m non binary, but now I don’t know if it’s that or even I identify as a guy. 

Within the proximity of the past two weeks  I’ve had some realizations.
1.  The guy I thought I had a cute crush on? I’m envious of him. I want to look like him and be his friend. I want to be a part of his friend group. This also makes me question my sexuality (I’m pan). 
2. I don’t like my genitals (?) warning. Imma talk about it and masturbation. I just recently started realizing I might hate having a vagina. I’ve always loved the idea of sex and the idea of masturbation. But every time I try to masturbate I immediately get turned off. And I’ve ALWAYS hated being vulnerable. I don’t like being touched on my chest or down there. But I love being the tougher. The very idea of being penetrated in any way makes me die a lil bit on the inside. And I’ve always been envious of how easy guys have it. Then I learned about the term “phantom penis.” I think I have that? Every once in a while it feels like I have a penis and then I move my legs and I’m made hyper aware that I don’t have one. 


Anyway. Question time.

2019-10-31 03:21:23,dphu9q,2,5,"Traditonally, how often have you heard cis men say cis women are a mystery, impossible to comprehend or decipher? And how often have you heard cis women say cis men are from another planet or emotionless or unable to communicate? Obviously these are stereotypes, but it sort of hit me how for cis people, the opposite gender is often something hard for them to understand. 

And then, within genders, often some cis women feel they cannot understand other cis women. Hence, ""I'm not like the other girls."" Same with cis men who can't understand a man who gets anywhere near something feminine unless it's done as a joke. Or even how there are just so many different brands of femininity and masculinity that cis people will judge each other for.

So then, why do cis people think it's so weird that they can't understand transgender people or non binary people? Cis people cannot even understand each other's concepts of gender. And same for transgender people. Why would a transgender person think being unable to understand someone else's gender, like a binary trans person being unable to understand a non binary person, why would they then decide it makes the other person's gender not real?

And sometimes I wonder, can ftms and mtfs really understand each other? Like yes they can, on a lot of levels, but at the same time, it can feel like the differences can be as wide as between experiences of cis men and cis women. Because they are on paths in such opposite directions. In shared meme subs for example there can a bit of an awkward divide when the same meme that makes one group euphoric makes the other group dysphoric, you know?

But still, women and men, both trans and cis, and non binary, can still have more in common with each other and more differences within groups. Everyone is an individual and not defined just by their group categorizations.

But I just think no one really understands gender or the experiences of various others and this even happens within the cis binary. As well as in trans binary.

Not that understanding doesn't happen between very different people, it happens a lot and it is great and should be cultivated.

But if someone lacks understanding of another person's gender, that person who can't understand shouldn't be surprised that they can't understand and just immediately invalidate them. They maybe should take a step back and realize that maybe the universe is much wider and more diverse than the scope of their own understanding.",trans,A long rambling thought about gender,1572517283.0,"{'created_utc': 1572492083, 'id': 'dphu9q', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Traditonally, how often have you heard cis men say cis women are a mystery, impossible to comprehend or decipher?

2019-10-31 15:08:05,dpoulj,0,3,"I feel terrible this morning because I was reminded of somethings that happened when I first started dating. Well I dated a bit as a teen but my gender and sexuality issues caused me to always break things out or flat out say no to any romantic anything, I do love romance but I just don’t think sex is hot in anyway. So when I got in my first real relationship it was definitely pretty abusive, there were a few times during sex he would grab my penis despite me saying before we ever even went on one date that I am never ever ok with that. I’d stop everything and I’d say *what the hell? You know I’m not ok with that*. And half the time he’d fake cry and swear he’d never do it again. There was also tons of emotional abuse, insulting me and breaking me down but I just wish I didn’t stay because I feel like such an idiot putting up with it for any length of time. I found out after we broke up he’s a TERF (like a feminist but bigoted against trans people) that was trying to convince me to identify as a feminine gay man instead of a trans woman. When I dumped him he told me he’d never do it again and cried, maybe even not fake that time. 

Then a few months after that I went on a few dates with a very attractive guy to test if I was asexual because I’d begun to realize, I’m in my 20s and never once got off to the thought of sex but having only been with one person I thought he was just bad at it. So eventually I had ads with this guy and I hated it, even though he was hitting the right spot physically and had a pretty big dick. That part I consented to, I wanted to know if I liked sex and I don’t. What I didn’t consent to was him sneaking snapping photos of my penis while we were having sex. It was the first time I’d gotten fully naked in a sexual context as I always wore underwear to cover the front with my ex. I just believed this new guy that he wouldn’t touch it, which he didn’t but the picture taking was about as bad if not worse. I feel like there’s a huge issue around trans porn and it treating trans women as a fetish, like it’s such a novelty to him that I have that. I want someone to like me in spite of my penis, not because of it. It feels like having a skin condition or self harm scars or something and rather than people ignoring them they like you because of it and want to focus on it a lot. Not all guys I’ve dated were like that but too many of them were what we call *chasers*, they chase trans girls a lot and are creepy about it. Anyway, this guy was like 6’7 and I was in his house so this one I don’t know how I could’ve stood up for myself other than leaving as soon as I felt like it was safe to do so. I was afraid of him because he was so big and tall. 

Last one I’ll talk about, I went on a date with this one guy who seemed really nice. We chatted for weeks online before meeting up, when we met up he was completely different.

Well I dated a bit as a teen but my gender and sexuality issues caused me to always break things out or flat out say no to any romantic anything, I do love romance but I just don’t think sex is hot in anyway. So when I got in my first real relationship it was definitely pretty abusive, there were a few times during sex he would grab my penis despite me saying before we ever even went on one date that I am never ever ok with that. I’d stop everything and I’d say *what the hell? You know I’m not ok with that*. And half the time he’d fake cry and swear he’d never do it again. There was also tons of emotional abuse, insulting me and breaking me down but I just wish I didn’t stay because I feel like such an idiot putting up with it for any length of time. I found out after we broke up he’s a TERF (like a feminist but bigoted against trans people) that was trying to convince me to identify as a feminine gay man instead of a trans woman. When I dumped him he told me he’d never do it again and cried, maybe even not fake that time. \n\nThen a few months after that I went on a few dates with a very attractive guy to test if I was asexual because I’d begun to realize, I’m in my 20s and never once got off to the thought of sex but having only been with one person I thought he was just bad at it. So eventually I had ads with this guy and I hated it, even though he was hitting the right spot physically and had a pretty big dick. That part I consented to, I wanted to know if I liked sex and I don’t. What I didn’t consent to was him sneaking snapping photos of my penis while we were having sex. It was the first time I’d gotten fully naked in a sexual context as I always wore underwear to cover the front with my ex. I just believed this new guy that he wouldn’t touch it, which he didn’t but the picture taking was about as bad if not worse. I feel like there’s a huge issue around trans porn and it treating trans women as a fetish, like it’s such a novelty to him that I have that. I want someone to like me in spite of my penis, not because of it. It feels like having a skin condition or self harm scars or something and rather than people ignoring them they like you because of it and want to focus on it a lot. Not all guys I’ve dated were like that but too many of them were what we call *chasers*, they chase trans girls a lot and are creepy about it. Anyway, this guy was like 6’7 and I was in his house so this one I don’t know how I could’ve stood up for myself other than leaving as soon as I felt like it was safe to do so. I was afraid of him because he was so big and tall. \n\nLast one I’ll talk about, I went on a date with this one guy who seemed really nice. We chatted for weeks online before meeting up, when we met up he was completely different. He was trying to run his hand up my skirt multiple times and I pushed his hand away and said no, then after that he took out his dick and was asking me to blow him.
