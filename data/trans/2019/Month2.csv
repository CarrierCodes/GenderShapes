I’m 17 and a junior in high school. I’m also in the closet about being mtf trans (sorta). So last year I came my mom and she was pretty supportive but also kept trying to convince me I’m not trans, saying things like “maybe you’re just metro sexual or...” . She also kept asking me a ton of questions like “do you want to be called her” or “ Do you want to wear dresses” every time my answer in my mind was yes, but for some reason all I could ever say was maybe, I’m not sure. After a few days of constantly being bombarded I just gave up and told her not to worry about it, we are moving soon so I can’t do anything now anyways. 

Now after almost a year, I’m back on the topic( I never really left) and I really want to start transitioning. Currently we live in the south though where it is very conservative, and that makes me nervous. However, my dysphoria gets worse as time passes and I can’t take it for much longer. So I think I’ll “come out” again soon and try to get into therapy or something. I probably won’t go full time or anything like that anytime soon but I want some of this pressure off me.

And for me, who does not hate or dislike their body, the answer would neither be yes nor no. Which makes this already difficult to explain topic of being trans even more difficult. But I found a way to explain it to people that works at least for me, and I am curious what you people think of it.

I would describe my relationship with my current body and thus, gender, kind of like a person and a car (mind, not counting in like these massive car-nuts. they would ruin this comparison). Everyone has one, knowing how to use it is more or less common knowledge and there are a plethora of different types. The problem with my car is that I can't see it, but everyone else can.

2019-02-01 15:34:28,am36ww,4,1,"when you say that you're transitioning from male to female and viceversa you're basically saying that you were a man/woman or even ARE right now just because you don't look/act as what is associated with a man or woman. 

if you're a trans girl, that's it! you are a trans girl, and not an MtF. you have always been a girl regardless of when you noticed it or your genitalia.

if you were born with a penis, you weren't born a boy, you were assigned male at birth.
being amab (assigned male at birth) doesn't make your genitalia male, if you identify as a girl your whole body is female. or isn't it ridiculous to say that someone's ears are female or male? so it is with trans people's genitals.

and same thing with trans boys.

side note: i didn't include non-binary people here because there is no term such as MtF or FtM for them (or i don't know any).

also, some trans people don't like to dress up or act as they are supposed to do ""according"" to their gender (socially) and it's okay too, and not because of it they're less trans.

and more thing, transitioning is different for each person and for some people it may be just changing name and pronouns, while for some others it may be changing their look, taking hormones, getting surgeries... and they're all equally valid and trans! so please respect that some trans people don't want to take hormones or get any surgery and don't press them.


back to the main topic, instead of using those terms (MtF and FtM), why don't we use AMAB and AFAB (Assigned Male At Birth and Assigned Female At Birth)? it's inclusive for nb people and it's not transphobic!

2019-02-03 03:49:19,amlze7,11,1,"I’m 39, and just now realizing that I’m trans; mtf. Ever since I was a young kid I’ve been fascinated  with putting on women’s clothes. It all started with a one piece bathing suit in my sisters bathroom- after that I found tights and skirts and would play dress up by myself and look at myself on the mirror. 
As a teenager, I experimented with more girl clothes and got more comfortable showing others and presenting as a female , but only at night when I had a buzz.  During the day I was a boy and I dated girls. I’ve mostly only had sex with girls, but I would always fantasize that I was the one being penetrated. What’s weird is that I’ve always been sexually attracted to girls because I love the way their bodies look and I want to be them. I had many bad experiences with cis sex where I couldn’t get it up because I wanted to be the girl not the boy. Like I wanted to be passive but I was expected to be the aggressor and I couldn’t perform. 
Usually when I’m having sex with a girl, I visualize myself as the one being penetrated and that’s how I get off. 

Anyway, my life went on and I continued cross dressing in secret and hiding it from my girlfriends because I was too ashamed of myself. I felt like it was just a weird fetish and not something intrinsic to my sexuality. I would go through phases where I would collect women’s clothes and wear them in secret and take pictures of myself. Then I would get afraid and purge all my clothes and throw them away, but I inevitability I would end up buying more a few months later. 

Fast forward to now and I’m married with kids and I always think my cross dressing days are behind me because I’ll have periods of time where it’s not that ever present in my thought, but then out of nowhere I’ll start the whole cycle again. I’m at a point now where I’m actively cross dressing again but I feel shame and am scared. 

I told my wife about 7 years ago about my cross dressing and she was not supportive at all. She thinks it’s gross and doesn’t want anything to do with it. She did allow me to go out as a girl for a summer, but never would allow my to be a girl around her. She finds the whole thing troubling and thinks it’s some deviant fetish that I should absolutely not tell my kids about. So that’s where I am now. After 5 years of little to no feelings of dysphoria, I now find my feelings stronger than ever and I want to stop feeling shame about it. I just ordered a bunch of clothes and boobs from Amazon and I want to wear them out. I also just shaved my legs and I have to hide it from everyone because I know my wife will react badly. But I really like the way I look as a girl and I want to just embrace my feminine side and wear eyeliner if I want to, or wear parties every day.

2019-02-03 19:08:45,amsr3r,0,1," Hiya doods! I hope this is a good place to ask this. I saw transgender identities and depersonalization coexisting with plenty of people so I decided to ask here. 

I recently realised I might be trans to some extent. The thing is, for quite a few years(4-5 I'd say. Blew up about when I entered puberty) I had symptoms related to depersonalization but I didn't know this was a thing until today or yesterday. Because of that, I'm even unsure where I stand on that trans scale...

 Even me realising I'd like to be a girl more happened in an odd fashion. I had a dream that brought a little flame for a few hours, then followed by a few more events I realised that. Until I actually talked with a friend about this I didn't feel any emotion apart from a bit after that dream. Felt a bit of fear before I started talking about it but that's to be expected. Even that self-discovery only filled me with goodness for 1.5 days and then I went back to my old emotional numb self. I really wish the woman voice was stronger. It's just so passive and I don't feel much about it either. It feels really wrong and I feel even worse than I do normally due to my emotional numbness. I say I feel worse but this is more of what my heart says I should be feeling. I'm still numb regarding that.

 Those 1.5 days I mentioned brought me more positive feelings than I got in years. I was so happy I could've burst. I do feel like I have this disorder. My intuition also tells me I have it, and I always listen to it. I just feel like it's not real and I wanted someone to help me figure it out.

Now that I feel like I summarized my condition decently enough, I'll talk a bit about my symptoms:

-Emotional Numbness. Besides negative thoughts coming from art and the good feelings I get sometimes when meditating on my girl identity I feel absolutely no emotion.
- Feeling as the world is flat and lifeless
- I feel I am like a robot, who's just going through the motions. I almost always am this way at school. It does happen at home when I indulge in what I want too though but not all the time
-I feel disconnected from life and people

 There's probably a few more things I didn't think of mentioning. These are the heavy hitters though. I felt really lost ever since I figured this trans thing out. Realising I have this disorder too makes it worse. It keeps me further away from feeling anything towards me as a woman and I feel like this hurts me most now. I really want to nurture this further but this thing is keeping me away from that. 

I'd really appreciate if you people could tell me if those signs are enough to diagnose myself with that. I also don't know what the root of the problem is. Could it be caused by depression or maybe the fact that I could be trans? My intuition kind of points me towards the latter but I'm not sure. If anyone knows of any tricks to lower the power of this disorder, please let me know. Also, sorry for beating around the bush so much. I always feel anxious when asking for advice here.

1970s - There was a mondo film called *Let Me Die a Woman* that showed trans women and surgery exist, but it was a fringe phenomenon.

1980s - Tula was on the cover of Playboy.  Being exposed ruined her career as a woman, but it exposed young people like me to the concept of transition.  I thought she must have been very lucky to have parents who understood and encouraged her, but, no, the reality was nothing like that.  In fact, Tula only found out about transition through her involvement in the gay subculture.  Meanwhile, there were ""shemale"" porn ads in Hustler, which puzzled and intrigued me.

1990s - Drag queens.  Divine.  RuPaul.  There were female impersonators, but it was all a show, gender performance.

2000s - Early Internet Age.  There were websites about transition, and there was a whole lot of ""shemale"" porn.  Transitioning still seemed crazy and not really an option.

2010s - Internet Age.  Now teens are transitioning and transgender women are a *lot* prettier.  It's no longer some strange phenomenon in foreign countries and, get this, people accept them as their preferred gender.  A revolution seems to be happening.  It's okay now to come out, and HRT is readily available to anyone.  People are still saying transgender = mental illness and enforcing a rigid concept of the gender binary, and people on the other side of the issue are saying things that don't stand up under scrutiny or that push an ideological agenda, but the overall cultural trend is towards being transgender being okay.

That's pretty much how I experienced history.  There are non-linear jumps, but I think the timeline is pretty accurate.

I hope this helps you understand why non-passing middle-aged trans women are coming out now and maybe sometimes seem to hold transphobic beliefs.  The current trans culture is just completely new and unlike anything that happened before.  In the past, you'd have to be lucky enough to be attracted to men and engaged in the gay subculture to even think about transition, and still today it's fairly unthinkable for an AMAB to transition without desiring to be fucked.  The new paradigm is totally new.

In case I come off as a homophobic transbian, I want to note that getting fucked did enter my prepubescent fantasies.  I just grew up dating women and learned to love penetration.  Even when you hate your genitals, you learn to enjoy what they do for you, and for me putting my penis inside vagina was very pleasurable.

Hi. So I'm new to Reddit, as well as what I'm about to talk about. I decided to make a Reddit account mostly to vent because, well, I have many friends and family on my other social media accounts that I can't necessarily come out with a lot of what's going on in my head right now. Especially since much of my family is homophobic, as well as transphobic.

I've been dealing with identity issues since I've finally gone to college, and to be frank, I'm slightly terrified of this whole ordeal. Going to school in a big city is terrifying, and now that I'm here, it's weird to even consider myself the same person I was, possibly about 5-6 months ago. In high school I was the weird kids, maybe in some ways, I guess I still am, but that's besides the point.

Ever since I've gone off to college, I've felt much different about myself, and I realized that, maybe I'm not the butch lesbian I thought I was, just when I thought I was so certain in myself for the first time. I'm starting to feel as though, physically, yes, I am a woman, but instead of being a woman mentally, I began to realize I might feel more comfortable with being a man rather than a woman.

To be honest, this terrifies, and excites me at the same time. Though I totally respect those who are immediately accepting of themselves when it comes to changing identities, I'm slightly scared of this new change because it is change. Not only that, but also because I have a fear of possibly losing friends, ruining relationships, and stressing out familial bonds, like I had the first time I had come out as a lesbian.

It was about a month ago that I told my girlfriend that I felt this way, and to my luck, she just cracked a dumb joke about being bisexual, and told me that she'd support me no matter what I did. Which, of course, I cried because I'm a big softy when it comes to that kind of stuff (haha), but I just am really glad she's accepting me for who and what I want to be.

I want to lose weight, learn how to say 'no' more often, become the man I want to be, and maybe someday, when we're both out of college, I want to get an apartment with her and just..make her happy. We're currently in a 115 mile distance distant relationship (which, isn't as far as some, I understand. And I am visiting her this Friday as of posting, which I'm beyond excited about. It's been about a month since I've seen her, and we've been texting non-stop about it. As well as seeing her. I get to meet up with some high school friends I haven't seen in forever as well.) and it sometimes is hard. It makes me happy, though, to be able to see her more often than some long-distance relationships would be.

I'm just happy she's here for me, and I know I'm so beyond lucky to have her.

(Sorry if this is just a huge wall of text. I really need to get my feelings out to someone, and since I don’t have a Therapist, I guess Reddit will have to do for now. Thank you for reading this. I can’t even begin to tell you how much I appreciate it.)

Holy shit I feel really fucking nervous posting this. I’ve thought about not posting this all day until I eventually said fuck it. Who knows. I might delete this later

I think I am trans. I’ve been wrestling with my gender and sexual identity for 2 years now, and I would be surprised if this wasn’t the the case. 

However this post isn’t really about that.

I feel so alone. For reference. I am a 17 year AMAB senior in high school. I live in a small town in a conservative state with conservative parents that I am certain are very transphobic. I have very few friends that have varying opinions on trans people ranging from not really caring to thinking the “whole trans thing” is stupid and ridiculous to actively calling people traps. I really don’t have anyone to go to and tell my feelings to. The crappy thing is that I would try to go to a therapist, but as far as I can tell. Out of the very few therapists in my town. None of them seem to be trans friendly. I can’t even go to school councilors due to them having outed a gay kid to their parents before.

And the thing is, I’m not even sure I should even transition. I want to go into music education. Specifically vocal music, and I’m not sure if I can ever achieve a female vocal range. I’m going to college on a vocal music scholarship, and I’m worried that trying to transition during college may get that taken away from me. 

Should I wait till college to start transitioning? Should I keep it a secret from my family? Should I continue to pursue vocal music if I am trans? Where should I start? What should I do? Who am I? Questions like these keep me up at night. I don’t know the answers, and I don’t know if I will ever get the answers. I feel lost, alone, and isolated from the people around me. Because I think that I’m trans, and that’s not acceptable where I live.

I hope things will be better in the future. Maybe I can finally have some clarity on where my life is going. I might have to make choices that are hard, such as leaving my dad who I have a good relationship with, and considers me his favorite son since my other two brothers have ignored him as soon as they moved out. I don’t want to leave everything behind if I transition, but that might be what I have to do.

I just wish I had someone to talk to

2019-02-06 04:43:04,ann4bk,6,1,"Let me try to make this as brief as I can:

My whole life I’ve spent with a nagging feeling in the back of my head that told me I’m not supposed to be this way.  That I’d be happier, or more content, or fit in better if I was a girl.  This feeling was with me as long as I can remember.  Mostly I would suppress it.  Sometimes it would come out in little subconscious ways.

For instance, I’d sway my hips when I walked or stand in a way that others would describe as feminine, or even my voice would occasionally refuse to stay in the lower registers where it belonged.  I could hear it in my thoughts, I could see it in my face, I could feel it in just the way I carried myself.  It was everywhere and yet nowhere.  Impossible to pin down.

Sometimes it would come out in larger ways.  I would wear women’s underwear and clothes as a little boy.  Before I even knew what sex was, I’d wear these things simply because I felt comfortable and right.  I remember playing dress up a lot and always somehow being the female character when I’d play.  When I watched TV or movies, I (still to this day) have identified with the women and girls more than the male characters.  Even as an adult, I wear women’s clothes around the house only shopping for clothing that looks comfortable rather than sexy.  I’ll stay in that outfit all day and never once have a sexual thought about it.  I wear a bra and panties under my street clothes when I go out.

That I’d be happier, or more content, or fit in better if I was a girl.  This feeling was with me as long as I can remember.  Mostly I would suppress it.  Sometimes it would come out in little subconscious ways.\n\nFor instance, I’d sway my hips when I walked or stand in a way that others would describe as feminine, or even my voice would occasionally refuse to stay in the lower registers where it belonged.  I could hear it in my thoughts, I could see it in my face, I could feel it in just the way I carried myself.  It was everywhere and yet nowhere.  Impossible to pin down.\n\nSometimes it would come out in larger ways.  I would wear women’s underwear and clothes as a little boy.  Before I even knew what sex was, I’d wear these things simply because I felt comfortable and right.  I remember playing dress up a lot and always somehow being the female character when I’d play.  When I watched TV or movies, I (still to this day) have identified with the women and girls more than the male characters.  Even as an adult, I wear women’s clothes around the house only shopping for clothing that looks comfortable rather than sexy.  I’ll stay in that outfit all day and never once have a sexual thought about it.  I wear a bra and panties under my street clothes when I go out.\n\nThroughout my life, I’ve been in a kind of denial about these things.

I'm 3 years in hrt now and while it needed some time, after 12month or so there were very markable changes and I had atleast half of the time a good passing. 24 months into hrt I passed most of the time and was really satisfied with where I got. Sadly over the last months it all broke down, to where I am now.
My passing is just miserable, my face is more ""square"" and overall masculine, I lost alot of hair, my skin isn't as soft as it was, my boobs shrinked a little, I got some tiny blonde hair over my whole body, even on places I haven't had any before hrt.
I started with 20 as an rather androgynous boy and puberty hit me a little late- even back then I passed better than now.
It's not just me, it's everyone who knows me and it's also very very obvious through photos ( I may share after work). My hormone tests were all right, only shgb was high and e2 only in the last bloodworks ( 600, but I used the gel only about a hour ago, so my endo said its nothing to worry about), testosterone was and still is very low.

So what could it be?? I got problems at work and I slowly begin to be very depressed. For over a year nobody new here and now it's so obvious. My endo hasn't any answer, as the Internet--isn't here anybody who has gone through sth similiar?

The Dysphoric Beast- by Joslynn T-H.

What is strange is the mercurial aspect of dysphoria. It consumes you, and then leaves. 

It is like a monster in the woods. You know it's there. You can hear its breathing all the time and you know it will be coming for you. 

Then it does and you have to run. 

You have to run fast and hard, because if you do not, it will eat you bit by bit. 

Piece by piece you will see what's wrong with your appearance. It will chew up a hand and make you see it's too big or too small. It will chew up your chest and you will see left over parts or the smallness of what's left. 

You will see hair so thick its fur and flesh so smooth it forces you to shudder. 

You will see its beard or lack their of on its many faces. 

What is left in its wake is broken and crying, knowing it will come again before too long and that you can only run so far. 

The Dysphoric Beast lurks and hunts and will never stop. 

It is the pain of  toothache that you can just barely ignore or the tingle of a sunburn across your flesh, making every moment you sit touching something uncomfortable. 

It's a million inconveniences and a thousand awkwardnesses. 

The worst part of all, all of its faces are your own.

2019-02-07 20:13:34,ao804a,8,1,"Pardon any spelling or wording wrong, mobile sucks, and my mind is racing

I came out as genderfluid in 2013, then in 2014 as ftm. Until 2016 I dressed masc and binded. 

In 2016 I started to wear feminine clothing again, grow my hair out. Wear makeup. (Those last two I never stopped doing.)

Some days, I literally look like a cis girl. This is weird because consistently since 2014 I've gone by Dan, and used he/him. My family doesnt care how I present, they call me what I want. They just ask I nicely correct if they say she bc of my looks.

And lately, Ive been being called ""transtrender,"" ""tucute"" by transmeds and what confuses me is that I have diagnosed gender dysphoria. Thats medically trans. Theyre just judging me based on how I look. I'm also told I just want to be a trans guy so when I date a man its gay bc I dont wanna be straight. I'm dating a trans man so...also I'm bi. Thats such a confusingly dumb argument. 
I dont want to discourse about this stuff. I'm just mentioning it because it gives me major dysphoria and anxiety and makes me wanna go back in the closet.
My opinion is that no one can tell anyone else their gender. Or their sexuality. Despite if you think theres requirements to be trans, you cant tell someone who they are. You're not them.

I id as nonbinary right now, I feel afraid to tell anyone my gender I align to.

I have reasons why I dress like this.

1. I feel like when I dress masc its very hard to get myself to look exactly how I want, otherwise it just gives me more dysphoria.

2. I like 'girl' things. I see people praise miles jai, Jeffery star (masc identifying people who dress feminine/similar to me daily.) yet when a man without a penis has this lifestyle/fashion...its not ok? That seems transphobic to me.

3. I literally dont want to give a fuck. My dysphoria hits me based on my natural body not being ""man enough."" Am I even fully male? Most people desire surgery and hormones for this (not saying I dont.) but the perfect scenario to kill my dysphoria would to be to accept my body as it is, that I am who I am without surgery, and change it if I desire to.

(Those last two I never stopped doing.)\n\nSome days, I literally look like a cis girl. This is weird because consistently since 2014 I\'ve gone by Dan, and used he/him. My family doesnt care how I present, they call me what I want. They just ask I nicely correct if they say she bc of my looks.\n\nAnd lately, Ive been being called ""transtrender,"" ""tucute"" by transmeds and what confuses me is that I have diagnosed gender dysphoria. Thats medically trans. Theyre just judging me based on how I look. I\'m also told I just want to be a trans guy so when I date a man its gay bc I dont wanna be straight. I\'m dating a trans man so...also I\'m bi. Thats such a confusingly dumb argument. \nI dont want to discourse about this stuff. I\'m just mentioning it because it gives me major dysphoria and anxiety and makes me wanna go back in the closet.\nMy opinion is that no one can tell anyone else their gender. Or their sexuality. Despite if you think theres requirements to be trans, you cant tell someone who they are. You\'re not them.\n\nI id as nonbinary right now, I feel afraid to tell anyone my gender I align to.\n\nI have reasons why I dress like this.\n\n1. I feel like when I dress masc its very hard to get myself to look exactly how I want, otherwise it just gives me more dysphoria.\n\n2. I like \'girl\' things. I see people praise miles jai, Jeffery star (masc identifying people who dress feminine/similar to me daily.) yet when a man without a penis has this lifestyle/fashion...its not ok? That seems transphobic to me.\n\n3. I literally dont want to give a fuck. My dysphoria hits me based on my natural body not being ""man enough."" Am I even fully male? Most people desire surgery and hormones for this (not saying I dont.) but the perfect scenario to kill my dysphoria would to be to accept my body as it is, that I am who I am without surgery, and change it if I desire to.

Also, if there is a better subreddit to ask this question on, please direct me there. Thanks in advance. 

Also, on mobile, formatting may suck. 


A few months ago (November), I came to accept that I am trans (MtF), but I have recently (past week or so) been coming to question if I was correct in that. The biggest reasons that lead me to realizing that I was trans initially were:

1. I know I would prefer having a female body to a male one. This is especially true when it comes to sexually. 

2. In many ways, I identify better with female gender roles, such as a preference for female fashion, makeup, and others I can't think of at this moment in time

3. I am much happier when I am referred to by she/her pronouns and my new name than my ""deadname"" (more on why that's in quotes later)

4. I often fantasize about being a woman instead of a man

5. Before coming out as trans, I came out as Bi, and I struggled with accepting that as accurate for a long time, but when I accepted I was trans, I realized that a large part of *why* it was difficult for me was because I'm not nearly as Bi as I'd be if I were a woman (hard to explain, happy to expand on)


However, recently, I've been thinking about how there are definitely plenty of things where I am 100% okay with being a man - I don't actually experience any *dys*phoria in those cases. I would even argue that I can't *really* think of any times that I do experience gender dysphoria, just a preference for being the other gender in specific cases. Additionally, I am totally fine being a guy in many ways that don't really fit with my current understanding of what being MtF is. Examples follow:

1. While I may wish I had the other set of body parts instead of my current ones, I am also totally OK with what I've got. I don't hate my parts, I'd just rather have the other ones.

2. I don't dislike my ""deadname"", or being called by it. It doesn't bother me at all, though I do get upset in groups where I have repeatedly reminded people that I want to go by my new name. This is less about dead name being wrong than about just being upset when people don't call me by the handle I prefer - it's the same when I change usernames, etc

3. I don't dislike it when people who don't know the *right* pronouns use the wrong ones. If I'm called by he/him, it's totally fine most of the time.

4. If I were to fully transition, I'd probably end up dressing the same, not wearing make-up, etc, because I like the casual look, and I like the clothes I have now (they're comfortable).

5. I actually like my facial hair.

There are probably some other things that I can't remember right now.

My overall goal in this post is to ask this: with the information above, and any clarification through comments, am I right in that I am MtF, or is there another term that may better define what I am? I love the trans community so far, and I identify so well with so many people that I have had the joy of interacting with, but I don't know if MtF is right for whatever I am. And before it is asked, the reason I'm looking for a lable is because labels help summarize a certain aspect of you so that you can find others with those same feelings and dilemmas, and join communities around such.

A while back I was having a lot of doubt about my trans-ness and posted in this sub about my experience, basically asking ""Does this sound like I'm trans?"" In my story I mentioned pretending to be sailor moon as a child, repressing feminine mannerisms as an adolescent / young adult, and identifying more with the ""female experience"" / womanhood in general, to which a few people responded that what I was describing had more to do with gender roles than it did my ""actual gender"". These comments kind of stung at the time and, being more sure of myself now, were extremely invalidating in hindsight. There seems to be this lack of cohesion in the individual narratives everyone cites for their ""trans awakening"". For some people there's more emphasis on the physical aspect of dysphoria (I wish I had a man / woman's body etc) isolated from any aspect of their personality, while for others there's more emphasis on the internal (I 'feel' like a man / woman, I identify more w masculinity / femininity, etc) and for others it's a combination of both. Now, I'm well aware of the fact that men can be feminine and women can be masculine. Even though I identify more with the concept of femininity as it applies to myself, there are also ways in which I'm more stereotypically masculine than even some of my male friends. But it IS the fact that I identify more with femininity and being conditioned to repress that as a child that MAKES me trans. I never really experienced physical dysphoria until recently as I've been changing my appearance to meet more of the feminine ideal than the masculine, and the limitations of my male body don't allow me to ""pass"" easily and live up to the cisnormative beauty standard that a lot of CIS women can't even live up to, but I've since chalked this up to the fact that the standard itself is the source of my dysphoria and that I should just carve out my own standard of beauty for myself with what I have to work with. This isn't to invalidate those who seek surgery / HRT because I feel like I get it, there are times when I look in the mirror and wish my facial hair would just disappear, but there are a lot of CIS women with facial hair! They're just as harmed by the binary as I am! Anyways there just seems to be this new narrative where people refer to their gender as if it were in a vacuum and are like ""I just knew"" while invalidating other trans people for not having the ""right"" feelings about their gender. If you ""just knew"" then HOW did you ""just know"". Anyways, it's not my intention to invalidate how others experience their gender but rather address the different vantage points we seem to be coming from related to this topic and hopefully reach a consensus through discussion.

I never really experienced physical dysphoria until recently as I\'ve been changing my appearance to meet more of the feminine ideal than the masculine, and the limitations of my male body don\'t allow me to ""pass"" easily and live up to the cisnormative beauty standard that a lot of CIS women can\'t even live up to, but I\'ve since chalked this up to the fact that the standard itself is the source of my dysphoria and that I should just carve out my own standard of beauty for myself with what I have to work with. This isn\'t to invalidate those who seek surgery / HRT because I feel like I get it, there are times when I look in the mirror and wish my facial hair would just disappear, but there are a lot of CIS women with facial hair! They\'re just as harmed by the binary as I am! Anyways there just seems to be this new narrative where people refer to their gender as if it were in a vacuum and are like ""I just knew"" while invalidating other trans people for not having the ""right"" feelings about their gender. If you ""just knew"" then HOW did you ""just know"". Anyways, it\'s not my intention to invalidate how others experience their gender but rather address the different vantage points we seem to be coming from related to this topic and hopefully reach a consensus through discussion. Please share your thoughts and feel free to negate my opinions / anything problematic you feel I may have said, I\'m open to having my views challenged.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Differing conceptions of gender among trans ppl', 'created': 1549656285.0}"

2019-02-09 09:41:30,aoqxpi,1,1,"It all began with ""Star Wars: Galaxies."" A strange place to consider a starting point for my journey, but it was the first time I had the real desire to be a woman. I created a female character named Arietta Phoenix and decided I wanted to roleplay not only her, but roleplay a girl playing her. So, for more than a year I lived in the game, made friends, and socialized as a woman. It was the best time I had in so many years. I felt awkward being courted by boys in game, but didn’t want to out myself or keep outright lying. So, I married my real life friend in game (the only person who knew the truth). As time went on, our guild purchased a voice over IP program and my secret was out. I lost a few friends that day because I lied about being a girl, but the fear was gone. I wished I could have stayed a girl longer.

&amp;#x200B;

It was shortly after this time that I was crippled with depression and anxiety. The cause was mostly stress over finances, difficult school courses, and the loss of my dog. I had to move back home for several years. After five years or so I returned to college, got my degree, and ran into the same triggers in grad school. I moved back home and became a recluse--entirely dependent on my family. I struggled with suicidal thoughts and planning for years, and I all but gave up on trying to be happy. Over that decade and a half, I occasionally wished I was a woman. I wished there were more complete transitioning methods (DNA modification, transplanting my mind, cybernetic bodies a la “Ghost in the Shell,” Genie wishes, reincarnation, being a changeling, etc.). I didn’t want to be who I was.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost never questioned that I was transgender, until I did some research on gender labels three months ago. I started the research to find out why I didn’t fit the typical male stereotype and if there was a better label for me. In the end, I realized most of my gender leans toward feminine, but I had been repressing it since I was twelve. My stepmother chided me for being too sensitive, and the fear of homophobic violence led me to repress everything. Now, all the years of wanting to be a woman made sense, because I wasn’t just curious or thought of it in a sexual way: I might be trans.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I had doubts. I spent 35 years as a male, so why did I want to change now? I spent three months reading trans people’s stories, and almost every story had similar notes to my own. There were even many that transitioned around this age. Every time I began to deny it, I would find too much in common to be coincidence. I tested another hypothesis: perhaps I was just bigender. In the end, the desire to be a woman and not a man didn’t fit with any other labels. After exhausting every possibility, the only label remaining was trans. After a bit more irrational fighting myself about it, I accepted that I am trans.

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing what I could to feel more like a woman stealthily, which wasn’t much without money. I used my Christmas money to buy some jewelry and fell in love with it. If I was going out, I would always put on a couple bracelets and a necklace. I wanted to have more jewelry including rings. I couldn’t start makeup or change my wardrobe without serious funds. I started growing out my hair and claimed it was out of laziness. I shaved my beard because “it was itchy” (really, it made me feel gross). I wanted to get rid of a lot of my body hair, but I thought my family might notice. Oh right, my family would have to know I am trans someday.

&amp;#x200B;

I started dropping news and jokes on them to see how they react to LGBTQ+ ideology, and got a negative reaction. They’re all religious, and believe all of it is a sin. Coming out to them will likely cause a tremendous amount of stress that I can’t handle.  Before I can come out, I have to be ready to deal with the pressure or be able to leave. So I must wait for the next decision on my disability, or move into public housing without it. However, there isn’t much transitioning that can be done without an income. So I wait for my chance at independence and to begin transitioning, like many of the young trans people’s stories I studied before. I wait: not to get older, but to get stronger.

2019-02-10 19:52:09,ap7ly8,3,1,"So...yeah. I have a pretty confusing profile. I'm a 46 year old biological male who's insanely attracted to girls and not at all to guys. I've wanted to be a girl since around age 8 or 9 and it's never abated. I have some of the dynamics that have sometimes been associated with transgender, crossdressing etc. -- abusive upbringing, horrible relationship with father, never being validated by the opposite sex and therefore feeling no positive association with maleness (as well as always being intellectual, cerebral, analytical, artistic, sensitive, not-tall, not-fit, not into typical boy interests - all things that make boys invisible to girls). 

As a guy, I have never had a scintilla of interest in touching another guy. As a girl, I would totally be physical with guys and date and flirt and be submissive and all that...but don't know that I would ever feel compelled to have a relationship with a guy or love one. Despite my horrible fortunes with women, I've managed to have some relationships, and an exciting sexual component in a LTR with basically my dreamgirl, a gorgeous, young, smart, cool, huge-hearted Latina. She was the first person to ever make me feel attractive and halfway normal as a male...but to this day I can't really be sure that any girl has ever truly found me attractive. 

Things broke down with us financially and emotionally (my entire life has always been a trainwreck in every way), and at some point in the LTR, as a function of my dysfunction, we started playing with cuckolding -- she was super hot and lots of men in her life wanted her, and I was super turned on by hearing about her being dominated by guys who were actually attractive and dynamic and masculine. This eventually led to her hooking up with a guy who she would get pregnant by and marry within months; part of this happened because our relationship had gotten toxic and she needed escape, but I'm sure it was also incredibly sexy for her. We're actually still close and even fooled around off and on after they were married, and she's said several times that she still loves me and has never really felt it with him. Long story there and I digress. 

Point is that I've somehow had a few somewhat-functional relationships with women, and absolutely enjoyed it, but I don't really ""work"" as a guy for the most part and so have continued wanting to be a girl even when getting validated by one...and I even envy these women and fantasize about being THEM. In fact, the bulk of my sex life is masturbating while pretending to be a girl and being really girlie and submissive to guys. I've fleshed out that fantasy world by having phone sex with men (I can sound/act startlingly like a girl) or even calling girls' clothing stores and asking salesgirls with help picking out outfits for dates -- I ADORE girltalking with actual girls about all the stuff girls talk about; it feels very natural and welcome and inclusive. 

Then when this cuckolding dynamic emerged, things got really twisted -- I started not just inhabiting the role of a girl, but that of my ex-girlfriend (the one described above and then the subsequent one, who came along 8 years later in 2015...in that one there was no cheating or cuckolding, but she did move on to several new boyfriends within a couple of months of ditching me). I would tell some strange guy/phone sex partner the whole story, perhaps slightly embellished, and we'd play out scenarios stemming from things I went through, except now I was my own ex-girlfriend, and my ""ex-boyfriend"" whom I'd cuckolded and/or dumped was ""him"" (but was really me). As much as it hurt me as a guy losing my girl(s), as the girl doing the cheating and humiliating, it was hot and liberating. 

So I still really want to be a girl, but I don't necessarily feel disgusted by or incapable of living as a guy; I'm probably more disgusted living as THIS guy, the guy I am. But ultimately I do think I would be happier as a girl and that my personhood would make much more sense as a girl. Fwiw, when I talk and present as a girl over the phone, everyone I engage with (male and female) loves me and treats me so nicely. I come off as sweet and happy and girlish and I can totally hear and feel how charmed people are by me. And even though I'm not instinctively attracted to boys, I'm 100% sure that if I were able to date as a girl and have a boy treat me like a real girl he's into, I would be totally into doing all the things girls do with boys. 

I wouldn't physically transition, but I've thought quite a bit about basically living as a girl, dressing and acting and socially identifying/presenting as one. The problem with THAT is I'm very overweight and not remotely pretty or feminine-looking. If I had to have a guy want to engage with me ""despite"" my looks or butchness, it wouldn't be very fun, I don't think. But I can't go on lonely and isolated and frozen in place, and it seems like this is the time in our society's history for someone like me -- whatever the hell I am -- to feel confident and safe trying to be whatever tv v bill 0",trans,Help?,1549853529.0,"{'created_utc': 1549828329, 'id': 'ap7ly8', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'So...yeah.

Tl;dr: my trans friend said she would ID me as gender fluid and I don't know if that's something that suits me.

I identify as a cisgender woman, but I occasionally like to cross dress for entirely non-sexual reasons. Sometimes I just like to be in male headspace and present as male.

It threw me for a loop. I've had serious conversations with myself about gender and very strongly feel female. Even when I'm in that male space it feels like a temporary hiatus from being my female self.

To be brief, trans-identity has been explained to me in the following way: a person is born male, say, at a certain point they begin identifying as a trans-woman because they feel their behavior and disposition is primarily feminine and on the inside, so to speak, they feel like a woman. Isn't this kind of thinking in a sense anti-feminist? To say one acts in a feminine fashion, is to confirm or support stereotypes about how a woman is supposed to act, right?

Hello fellow reader! My name is Ryder and I am currently 14 years old, and biologically male. I have been having cases of gender dysphoria for many years now, probably about 3 by now. I’ve had dreams about being a girl and have even worn girl things in secret. If possible I’d like to seek advice and explain my story to you all.
To start off, I grew up as someone who has been ahead of all of their peers physically. I had an early onset puberty that started at 8 or 9 years old and today I look like some 18-20 year old when really I’m only 14. I have more hair on me than my dad and my voice is VERY deep. Cutting to the chase, I hate it. I hate being a guy. I want to be a girl. I want to be a girl mainly because I could finally express who I really want to be. I no longer have to be held back by my masculinity and be expected to either take charge or act tough. To be honest, I’d much rather be a weak person who looks cute, not a person who looks overly masculine and “manly”. I’ve hurt others on complete accident because of my body, and I’ve had enough of it. I’m disgusted with what my body has become. (To give a visual for you all, it’s not ugly or anything. I’m pretty skinny and thin, and some muscle in my upper torso, but I personally don’t like the way I look.) I also don’t like my deep voice, I’d love to have a soft light voice. I’ve also trained my voice to partially speak higher pitched, but it doesn’t always work well.
I’ve told my closest friends about this, and they’ve supported me, but by now it doesn’t feel like they do. To me, it feels like they’re toying with me when it comes to it. My friends are finding it irritating or questioning it when they know it’s true. It makes me get really depressed. One of them though is pretty relaxed on the matter and supports me, heck, I’d say I’ve actually sort of fallen for him now (not because of that though). But he’s already got a GF so that won’t really work. I just feel feminine and have started to act a little more feminine than usual.
I’ve wanted to tell my parents, but my dad is scary and his view on the trans community isn’t the greatest. He’s even forced me to change outfits several time because they look to “feminine” or “non-manly”, and has even harassed me over “gender rules” because I said something about it he disagreed with. You have no idea how many times I’ve wanted to hit him, but of course, I won’t, it’s his opinion but he’s trying to force on me it seems. Screw being manly, let me be who I want to be!
My dream is to become a girl named Ryleigh and become a female Artist, mainly art in the anime department of things. Artists like Kamiya Yuu (No Game, No Life) and Sayori (Nekopara) for example. I’m pretty skilled as it is in it and maybe hope to produce a novel series or even contribute to a game series with my artwork. 
I also want to be a girl because...I’m scared to be a guy. Ever since the #MeToo movement started some women have been taking advantage of that and have been framing famous men for stuff they haven’t done. Don’t get me wrong, I will support those who speak out, but whether I’ll believe you or not depends on if your lying or being truthful. I don’t want it be a grown man who makes a famous series then gets accused of something I never did. I’d have my career ruined and everything for something falsely made up! This is only a minor factor though, I really don’t wanna grow up as a guy anymore.
To sum all of this up, I want to be a girl because of past experiences as a guy, gender dysphoria factors, and wanting to be the real me. I’m held back by social norms and cannot escape the bubble society has placed me in. I’ve had lots of time to think about this, and I had reached this decision about a month ago after 3 years of deep thinking and depression. 

I don’t want to put all the details (I missed a lot after reading over it) down just because it would take me probably and hour or two to right everything down. I’ll end it here and just post this.

I’m held back by social norms and cannot escape the bubble society has placed me in. I’ve had lots of time to think about this, and I had reached this decision about a month ago after 3 years of deep thinking and depression. \n\nI don’t want to put all the details (I missed a lot after reading over it) down just because it would take me probably and hour or two to right everything down. I’ll end it here and just post this.\nAdvice would be helpful, and some encouragement. With this jumble of words it’s probably really hard to comprehend.

2019-02-12 20:39:08,apxy0y,0,1,"Hello, here is my most recent advice for changing name and gender marker specifically in WA State (could likely be easily adapted to other states, especially the info for SSA and Passport as those are federal services)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

Start by gathering a few initial forms:

1. A name change petition [(link for adult)](https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/courts/DistrictCourt/pdfs/petnc.ashx?la=en)
   1. On this petition there will be a reason for name change, a great option is “It more accurately represents who I am”
2. A Social Security Name Change Request Form [(link)](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)
   1. On this form in box 8, mark your correct sex, not the one assigned at birth
3. Change of Gender Designation Request for the Dept. of Licensing [(link)](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/520043.pdf)
4. An Application for US Passport, if applicable [(link)](https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds11.pdf)
   1. You need an application for a new passport, not renewal, regardless of if your current passport is valid or not; because you’re changing information

Ok, now, before you even start filling out forms, send your doctor an email. Unfortunately to change your gender marker you must receive “appropriate clinical treatment” which is defined as “Your physician determines what appropriate clinical treatment is according to acceptable medical practices, standards and guidelines, and certifies that you have had appropriate clinical treatment for transition to either male or female. Surgery is not a requirement to get a U.S. passport.” The doctor who writes this letter **must be an M.D. or O.D.**

A sample email to send your doctor is:

“Hello ***Dr.’s Name***,

I am writing to request the writing of a letter to change my sex marker on my Passport. Attached below the template for it from the Dept. of State website. Just for your recollection, I have been taking ***Drug One Name*** (currently: ***Dosage*** mg/day) and ***Drug Two Name*** (currently: ***Dosage*** mg/day) for approximately ***Total Time on Medications***. Also if it's needed, I attached my most recent blood work. ***(If you have it)***

For your reference I have copied and pasted the following from the Dept. of State:

Medical Certification

A signed, original statement from a licensed physician must be on office letterhead and include:

* Physician’s full name, address, and telephone number
* Medical license or certificate number
* Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate
* Language stating that:
   * He or she has treated you, or has reviewed and evaluated your medical history
   * You have had appropriate clinical treatment for transition to male or female, or are in the process of transition to male or female
* The statement must include, “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true and correct.”
* Medical certification requirements are the same for a minor as an adult.

Your physician determines what appropriate clinical treatment is according to acceptable medical practices, standards and guidelines, and certifies that you have had appropriate clinical treatment for transition to either male or female. Surgery is not a requirement to get a U.S. passport. 

Thank you so much!” 

Also attach [this template](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/passports/content-page-resources/Physician%20Letter%20Example3.docx) with any blood work you have.

Now it’s the exciting day! Name change day!!

1. Find out what time name change petition must be filed with the court clerk and head to the courthouse with some time to spare, the only 3 things you need are:
   1. Name Change Petition filled out
   2. Current ID with soon to be legally dead name
   3. $207 in **cash**
   4. Note that courthouses are secured places, you will go through a metal detector and bags through an X-ray, so don’t bring anything you wouldn’t take on a plane.
2. File your petition, pay the fee (**this must be done with cash**) ask clerk for 3 copies
3. Hang out till the hearing. (If you’re going to the King County Courthouse in Seattle there’s a public law library on the 6th floor that is a great place to wait
4. Go to your hearing at the appropriate time and stand before the judge, nothing to stress about, they will likely ask no questions other than confirming you’re not doing this to commit fraud.
5. Smile like a giddy school child and thank the judge and the clerk will hand you the 3 copies of the court order to change your name.

Next, you must pick up the letter from your doctor’s office, and while you’re there, ask them to sign off on the DOL Change of Gender Designation Request.

From here you’ll go off to the Social Security Office, take with you:

1. An original of the court order to change your name
2. The Passport (yes, passport) letter from your doctor to change your gender
3. Current ID (yes, it will still have your dead name on it)

There is no fee for this filing, just the 3 hours of your life you’ll spend at the SSA. I recommend going right when they open, and the one at Aurora and 135th is much faster and more pleasant.

Now, go to the DOL, again, not the downtown one, or it will take forever. You will need:

1. A current ID
2. The Court Order to change your name
3. The Change of Gender Designation Request, completed by you and your doctor
4. The fee’s are crazy and hard to understand, I’d recommend getting an Enhanced ID it will either be about $24 or $113, depending on how much longer you have until your current license expires
5. To get all spruced up if you’d like for your new license photo (just remember your hair will have to be out of your eyes)
6. While you’re all spruced up you might as well swing by Walgreens and get your passport photos done (for $16.50)

Next you go off to the Passport Authority and take:

1. A Court Order to change your name
2. Application for a U.S. Passport
3. Passport photos
4. The Passport letter from your doctor to change your gender
5. This will likely cost $165, I have no idea what lowers the cost, though the website say’s $0-165

Congratulations! With these documents you should be able to change your name everywhere you need!

Costs:

Court Ordered Name Change

$207

New License

$113

I really can't imagine myself leaving him as a girlfriend or as a friend in general, but I know that transition can be strenuous on both whoever is transitioning and those close to him. I know certain -needs- may change but nothing else really. So, trans-men and trans-men's partners, how did his/your transition affect your relationship?

2019-02-13 07:37:50,aq44iy,19,1,"but I'm a straight man not driven by a fetish or a preference.  The odds that I encounter a trans woman with the right personality before meeting a cisgender woman of equal appeal are slim.  I find trans women potentially appealing because of how their struggle likely refined the value they place on a relationship and the acceptance they receive.  My own personality is half as rare as transgenderism, so I'm not a complete stranger to alienation and a sense of rejection, and my two marriages have been with toxic cisgender women.  I can't imagine surviving a third under those terms.

I'm principled and completely burnt out on drama.  Hook-ups have no appeal to me.  Sex is a distant secondary interest to a quality relationship.  Otherwise, I doubt a transgender woman would be my preference.

I'm focused on college and my son.  I'm not exactly in a rush for a new relationship.  I'm still recovering from my last marriage, which did not end in divorce only because my wife passed from cancer first.  Trans women were not on my radar screen until I met one online with a very compelling personality, and I did some serious soul searching as a result.

I am putting this out here as food for thought.  You can call straight men transphobic all day long and change nothing.  Gender constructs can be nuked completely and nothing will change.  Straight men are attracted to female bodies, female gender, or a combination of the two.  I discovered, my attraction is by far to the female gender.  To even consider a trans woman could make me pan I guess, but that's ok.  Straight is the better description.  Pass-ability is likely nearly essential, but perhaps a strong and developed gender identity can overcome more than I imagine.  I have no personal experience to base it on.

Regardless, I'm happy to be an ally, and it just may be by becoming active locally for the community I meet a ciswoman ally who's support for the community reveals she has the character I seek.  

I can't stress enough that people don't seek out identities for partners.  They seek out people who they are attracted to and can fall into love with.  There are amazing transgendered people who have progressed in their transitions and emerged as remarkable people.  I encourage everyone to purpose to reach that point and be careful about becoming hardened against people.  No one will ever know who you are if you lose yourself along the way.  Community and support are awesome and necessary, but to find love at some point you have to do you.

I'm not trans, and I have never questioned my gender, but I have just finished a paper analyzing an argument made by a brilliant trans man, and he completely demonstrated the power of finding a real purpose for his writing and his approach.  That is the wisdom I am passing on when I seem to counter popular sentiment at times.  I care about you all as people and the community comes by default.  I also bring the perspective of a good person once opposed ignorantly but innocently to the broad acceptance you seek.  Please take this to heart.  There's more to accomplishing what you seek than just ""us verses them.""

Anyway, the prospect of being essentially a miracle to someone vs just another relationship is appealing, but with more time for those thoughts to settle, I find little interest in attempting to make it happen.  There doesn't really seem to be a promising way to pursue such a relationship with these motives anyway.  Personality can impact how I view someone's appearance but appearance has no bearing on how I view someone's personality.  So I encourage anyone who's seeking someone with something other than a fetish to resist being defined by rejection and to determine instead to be true to themselves in every fresh encounter.  Let the people you meet reveal who they are and ignore the odds that would prevent you from ever having a chance to know when you meet the person who is different.  There is nothing about me that would suggest I would respect a transgender person.  I'm a conservative Christian who lives in the country with guns, tractors, and chainsaws.  I'm not surprised getting to know someone transformed my opinion on the issue, but the passion has been a complete surprise.  The next person you meet could have the same ally potential.

One more thing.  You aren't all the same.  Some of you are indeed women born into the wrong body and vice versa, but not all.  There are others who are much closer to the predominant cis perspective of the entire community.  Your experiences will be unique and so will your appeal, especially to straight people.  It's all the more reason to be true to yourself and to guard against a self-defeating perception of the dating pool.

Some are of less importance that it wouldn't be too concerning to a Doctor(ie. RBC counts for gals is between 4.0-5.5million/uL, guys is between 4.5-6.0million/uL). Others are significant.  For example: a positive ""pregnancy test"" for a birth female means they're pregnant, where a positive Beta-HCG(pregnancy test) for a birth male means they probably have testicular cancer.  When trauma victims are given uncrossmatched blood, women(of child bearing age, 0-50 years old) are given Rh-negative blood so there is no risk of them developing antibodies to the D-antigen found on Rh-positive donor red cells(development of anti-D can cause serious disease of future pregnancies.  It used to be one of the main causes of gestational and newborn mortality).  Men are given Rh-positive blood in a trauma because they don't have a uterus.  This has been a debated topic in my blood bank for some time as we await the administrators to tell us(they don't ask us for input) how folks that don't identify as M or F(in the traditional sense), will be registered and what will we see on our computer screens for a sex or gender.

Like most guys would just walk up and talk to this girl. There are many of these situations for me. So what I'm trying to do is be more man cuz I don't want to be a woman inside. I don't like it. Any suggestions on how to change? "", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I'm broken inside"", 'created': 1550204765.0}"

2019-02-20 15:52:30,aspvrf,8,2,"Hello everyone ! First time here.

I sometime went on reddit because I saw a lot of wonderful posts and saw good advices or heartwarming stories, but today I need to share something and I hope you could give me answers.


First of all I'm a 30 years old French that use to consider herself as a trans woman.
Since my childhood I always knew I was a girl, I loved to share secrets with my girl friends and felt so well with them. I'm also very feminine in my way of talking or in the general manners. And for nearly every activities I was really attracted to girl things. I heard about the real thing at 13 and it all made sense. I just knew it.

Also I'm romantically pansexual but when it comes to sex I think I'm really attracted to men. I was kind of impatient to make a transition but for some financial and professional reasons I decided to wait again and again... maybe too much.

Also I'm feeling not that bad with my body of course I would largely prefer a woman's body but it's kind of ""ok"" I guess. The only hard pain I've got is that I know I would never be pregnant. But, well I'm not the only one... Well that was about me.


Anyway, here is my bad experience :

I do not live in a big city or in a very ""open"" place, so I'm not in contact with people like me. Hopefully my best friend is a amazing girl that happens to be lesbian, so it is the only person I can really talk to and she's very great. But I wanted to know more people like me so I looked on Google and found a transgender group on a 2h roadtrip from my place.

I went there saturday and I'm heartbroken since. First of all the fact that I was dressed in totally casual clothes and that I had short hair seems to have atracted strange looks. I personally think that they all seemed amazing, all 5 of them were at least on HRT and looked really great. I was in admiration in front of all that courage.

They talked a bit and then it was my turn. I told them about my feelings. They asked me about my dysphoria and I told them that luckily I had none. This created some kind of strange atmosphere, I think one of them laughed at me at that point. Then one of them asked what I was doing there, and if I was sure I was at the good place. I just didn't know what to say. Finally a second one told me that I shouldn't consider myself trans because I was androgynous. And the first one did let a muffled laughter.
I NEVER felt so bad in my entire life. I just stood and left. I cried all the way home. I'm kind of depressed since.


I'm not sure what to think anymore. Did I said something wrong ? What should I do ? Help me please.

Firstly background
She has been my friend for my whole life (19 years, she's twenty two) and let's say our childhood was, difficult. My father commited suicide when I was seven and I went moved about 21 times until I was seventeen, as a result I only kept her as any form of friendship throughout my life. Her life was probably even shittier, her parents had an extremely rocky relationship until the got a divorce when she was 14(?) And she tried to kill herself when she was eight. Roughly a year before my dad.

So, the main problem I'm facing is that she has told literally everyone in my personal life that she is trans, from my mother to my girlfriend. All before me, and I only first met my girlfriend three years ago. I have been told that she is afraid to tell me, and I do defintely get that, it is terrifing to imagine the concept of your bestfriend hating you for who you are, but I feel that this secret is going to burn inside of her until there is nothing left.

So I was hoping to get your guy's input on the matter, I was thinking of getting her to a private place (like her house) and gently bring up the topic that I know she is trans?

2019-02-22 18:31:49,atl1yw,4,7,"Hi,

I'm 3 years in hrt and this is not the first time I bring this up- sadly I was mostly ignored in the forums or here on reddit when I asked and my endo just told me “well uhm, yeah, this just happens sometimes, you know? genetics blabla"", he also told me e1/ e2 balance doesnt matter at all and never tested me on both, just on total estrogen.
I havent got the worst passing, but sadly it depletes. My face and overall my body appears harder, because of loss of subcutaneous fat tissue, my breasts shrinked a little, my hair thinned and I have little blonde hairs all over my body. vellus, not terminal hair most likely, but still they werent there before.

I was a rather feminine boy before transition, even kinda androgynous and so the first year of hrt nearly granted me a 100% of passing. but this changed sadly and mostly bc of my face, when I dont have make up on, I started to have been recognized as a trans quute often and this just got more over time.
I was on 6mg of estradiol pills ( sadly I  havent gotten these, you can take sublingually) and my estrogen levels still always were very low. so he switched me to gel, from which I had normal to high levels  last time I was tested even super high levels ( 3 times the recommended), so he lowered my dose. ( still I took the gel only about 2 hours before the bloodwork)
I was on 100mg of spirinolactone for most of the time and switched to 10mg of cypro recently, because I got regular headaches.

I also had an opiate addiction and got methadone for a few months, now 4mg of buprenorphine. beside of that I dont smoke, dont drink, eat a very healthy pescetarian diet and am quite active. my endo also means, that opiates could affect hormonal levels in cis people, as they alter the gonade axis, but in trans people with their exogen hormones that'd be highly unlikely. sadly there isnt any proper research about this to compare.
my thyroid also seems to be ok.

what could this possibly be? 😔

I, a bisexual cis woman, love him so much. He’s my whole world and I plan on spending the rest of my life with him. I’d love nothing more than to see him blossom into the person he really is after years of confusion. I want to support him every step of the way. 

That said, I have to admit I am devastated. I fell in love with this rugged, bearded, broad shouldered man and to me, his body is perfection. He already started to remove hair and wear dresses sometimes around the house, he’s an ABSOLUTE cutie but with every step he takes towards full transition, my heart breaks a little bit. I feel like I’m losing this beautiful man piece by piece and it’s so hard eventho this other part of me is extremely proud of him and finds him absolutely beautiful. 

I don’t know who to talk to about how I feel, I really do not want to interfere with his transition, i don’t want him to feel guilty. I feel like he doesn’t need to hear the devastating emotions I’m going through cause he already has more than enough on his plate. I feel like crying almost all the time and I feel absolutely horrible for feeling anything else than positive emotions about this. I’m also so scared of how it’s all gonna affect our sex life... He already has little to no sex drive these days and, this is just a guess, but I think he’s not always comfortable with using his penis but he doesn’t want to tell me... He’s really interested in HRT and I have no idea if that’ll just kill his sex drive. (I basically know next to nothing about HRT. Feel free to educate me!) 

I’d love to hear other people that lived through a similar experience. how you dealt with the situation without forgetting about your own well being, who to talk to, how to support him better etc... any advice is welcome. I just wanna be a great supporting partner but I’m scared I’m gonna loose myself trying to stay strong.

2019-02-25 02:57:41,aug2r9,7,1,"First of all, I am not transgender, but my younger brother is. 
He told my family this from a very young age and is currently (10+ years later) almost fully transitioned to male. 

I mention this because I believe that growing up with him has given me a fair amount of exposure and (indirect) experience with the topic.
He does share this question with me.


That said - I simply cannot understand how one can claim to be transgender without experiencing gender dysphoria. 

My brother’s trans status is defined by dysphoria, the feeling that his body is not his. There are/were obvious sex characteristics: breasts, a vulva, feminine bone structure, etc. that did not align with the wiring of his brain and the resulting masculine view he had of himself. 

These feelings are understandably accompanied by the desire to be seen as and addressed as a male - with the socially accepted male name and pronouns.

He does wear typically masculine clothing, a shorter haircut and enjoys more stereotypically masculine things (like sports and video games) - BUT so do many women!!

This is why I believe it’s problematic to call this last facet “gender expression.” Without the sexual dysphoria, I would have a tomboyish sister. This label of gender expression as an aspect of being transgender just seems to further the divide of socially enforced gender roles.

Which is why I can’t comprehend what would prompt a person to identify as transgender without experiencing dysphoria.

What inspires someone to identify as a man without the desire for male anatomy? How can you separate lifestyle from anatomy?

Why would one desire to be “seen” as a male with pronouns etc. without also feeling they should have the body of a male?

^these apply to both/all genders.

Some have said the problem with this view is that it’s “gatekeeping” the trans community or telling someone you know their gender better than they do.

I have no intention of doing this at all! But biologically and scientifically, I just don’t get how it’s really valid?

Thanks! :)

2019-02-25 17:03:25,aunh5r,8,7,"Hi! Not trans or nb at all, but just curious.

The definition of transgender that I see used the most is that they are a person who identifies as a gender that they were not assigned at birth. There are a lot of people I see who identify as nonbinary but I am almost certain that no one is assigned nb at birth, it is something that they come to identify with and eventually declare themselves. 
I always see the word trans applied to mtf or ftm trans identities but no other types of genders, specifically nb, despite the fact that nb is a gender identity that an individual was not assigned at birth. 

why is that? Is there a difference between being born female and eventually identifying as nb, as opposed to being born female and eventually identifying as male? Is one more trans than the other?

Thanks for any clarification! 
Also, I dont mean to offend or invalidate anyone, I'm just genuinely curious.

2019-02-27 08:32:34,avb6oc,0,7,"i (mtf) have wanted to transition for a while. i first met a transgender person in my freshman year and it like, clicked. then i realized how much dysphoria i had, and realizing it made it worse, and i've struggled with it for four years now. but, during my senior year, i met this girl. she told me she'd date me if i transitioned and told me all these nice things.

but this is a story about me not coming out, so uh, she lied. a week in i basically, out of fear of losing this girl, who i love deeply, decided to silence myself. i struggled to keep my personality and mannerisms in check (everyone always pins me as a gay guy because of how i act and talk aha) and like. i just kept it down and tried to pretend i was ok being a boy. thus followed the most suicidal times i ever had since i realized i wanted to be a girl. i'd already came out to all of my close friends, so because of this girl, i felt uncomfortable talking to my friends and made her and my very closest friend into my entire support system. this was because i felt like, if i talked to people who knew i was trans and would talk to me supportively about being trans, i'd have a harder time surpressing it, and it was like cheating to me. looking back i was mentally destroying myself. i never pictured myself going to prom in a suit, or not coming out my senior year, and now i worry that i'm not trans enough. all of the thoughts running through my head lately have been this worry that i'm a trender or whatever.
and i'm not sure where that comes from because i have dysphoria with my chest, my face/head, and with my er, dick, and also major social dysphoria, but i just keep thinking i'm not valid enough idk.

I see trans stuff on the news and like... it's great that it's getting more coverage, but we're always represented as a strange, alien thing that should be studied. Is that just me that notices that? Even positive coverage has a lot of this. It feels like everything I do becomes politics and that I can't exist without being an activist of some sort. I just want to live a normal life, not be flooded with questions and considered some strange animal or smth. 

I have so much internalised transphobia. I feel terrible about it, but I can't stop it. I never wanted this but now I'm stuck in this situation I hate. Don't get me wrong, we have a wonderful and vibrant community and I want the best for my trans siblings. I'm always excited to offer advice and help out, but there's a toxic branch, is there not?

I'm talking about tucutes who insist on using ""spivak"" as a pronoun. We just want to live, be normal, and some people, desperate for attention insist on dragging us down cause they think it's cool. 

I digress a bit with this, but I gotta know if other people feel it too:  I've been on reddit for a while, but avoided trans and LGBT safe spaces deliberately. I've always veered away from community. I go to pride, I'm not ashamed of who I am, but I don't want it to define me. I don't want to be a snowflake but I find myself questioning whether or not things are offensive. I feel the need to push back against transphobia I see, but I don't want to be labelled an SJW, and I don't want the abuse that results from it. People watch their mouths around me cause sometimes I'll jokingly say ""that's homophobia"" but because I'm trans they expect me to tear their heads off for every mistake; I do not. I am very chill and ignore most shit, even getting misgendered (mainly cause I don't wanna cause a fuss, especially if it's someone I won't see again)

I'm feeling like shit and didn't know where to put this. I'm sure I'll lose a fuck ton of karma, but alas, whatever. If you disagree with me, call me out!

I’m the lead for the LGBTQ+ inclusion network at my workplace and a trans employee recently brought up her concerns to me about the lack of policies on transgender employees. While HR was supportive and respectful, they basically just asked her what she needed instead of being proactive. 

Today I brought it to the attention of a very senior gay executive. The Ontario Human Rights Commission states workplaces should have guidelines and policies in place *before* an employee approaches them. 

Does anyone have any experience with this and have any advice I should be aware of going forward?

Many thanks :)",trans,Canada: Supporting a trans employee at work,1551396241.0,"{'created_utc': 1551371041, 'id': 'avsykz', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Hi all!
