Yea I'm not sure what i am. I spend as much time thinking about how much i would love being a girl and would feel more comfortable and valid that way as I spend appreciating being a guy. Makeup is my guilty pleasure and I want longer hair than I have to feel more feminine yet I love shorter hair and the little bit of facial hair I have. I feel like myself as a guy and scared I only wished I was trans when I had less control of my life to give me some control over myself but now that I'm picking my life back up the thoughts keep coming and don't feel any less real. I'm happy as a guy, I feel comfortable as a guy, but if I were born a girl or somehow could transition in a day with everyone in my life being accepting and loving like if i said i liked an unpopular band or something and it wouldn't change anything about how they view me or act around me I'd be much happier and I'm almost sure of that. I don't know why I wanted to rant here or what I wanted to hear or not and I might delete this after a bit since I'm terrified of someone finding this and pinning it to me from my post history or something idk.

I was born a man and until just a few days ago that was always who I had convinced myself that I was comfortable with being. That was until I was exploring some online chatrooms. I needed a place to vent about my deep innermost thoughts and where just a few kind souls would listen. I started a vent by talking about some online roleplaying I do (it helps me develop and get feedback on characters) and an odd trend that I noticed where I was playing almost exclusively female roles. I wanted to diversify my cast and that's where the first phrase of interest came. ""I just kind of struggle imagining myself as a guy sometimes"" I said. The conversation began to delve deeper. people asked a few questions. and eventually we got to phrase two. ""I just don't really like playing men anyways."" And that's where two specific people in the group chat took particular interest in me. One firmly believed from that moment that I was trans already. And the other was planning on playing devils advocate (as to not bias my mind). The conversation began with just these two from here on out and that's when the final nail in the coffin was lay ""I am just not comfortable as a guy"" this sentence was said just two days ago.

I‚Äôm on a wait list for hormones, pass very well as is, getting divorced (unrelated to transition, he‚Äôs bi, got a girl pregnant, it‚Äôs like, totally done), and have been casually dating a cishet man for 6 weeks now. We‚Äôve both come to the conclusion that we‚Äôd like more out of this than we ever thought we‚Äôd find on Grindr.

I am understandably apprehensive about this!! This guy and I have a ton in common, more than I ever did with my husband (I got married when I was 18, lesson learned) and we are both looking to take things slow, it just feels like it‚Äôs time for the next step.

He‚Äôs great in every conceivable way thus far. He treats me very well, respects my boundaries, we show each other new things both SFW and NSFW, we‚Äôve gone out every weekend since our first date. It‚Äôs gotten better each time. That said, we are both insecure as all hell. He has had some fucked up relationships and has been going to therapy to work through that and is making good progress, evidently. I‚Äôm still anxious as can be though.

Basically, I‚Äôm very very concerned that he‚Äôs going to miss cis girls and leave me? He has dated a couple trans girls since high school and by his account the one sort of serious relationship ended mainly because of distance. He has also got a way of phrasing things where, although his heart seems to be in the right place, it makes me feel insecure even though they‚Äôre compliments? He‚Äôs very attracted to me which is great but he‚Äôs like amazed at how smooth I am which is cute because he rubs my legs but I immediately cringe at the fact that I shave my entire Italian bear ass body two hours before he comes by. He says I look incredible despite being ‚Äúall natural‚Äù (meaning pre-HRT) and says it‚Äôll only get better for me re: dysphoria but also me becoming more attractive because hormones are magic, and my mind immediately goes to losing sexual function and therefore losing all of my niche fetishized appeal even though he has not actually said anything to make me think he‚Äôs fetishizing me!

I‚Äôm listing out all of the bad and I shouldn‚Äôt. We have endless things to talk about while he‚Äôs here, he calls me to say goodnight and we talk for hours more often than not, it seems like the beginning of something great. But when I was with my husband I constantly felt like he was looking for something I couldn‚Äôt readily provide (vaginal intercourse hello) and now, despite the fact that this new guy is very much interested in all of my body, I feel like eventually he‚Äôll get bored of me and knock up his coworker like my ex did.

I've been with a female as a man for a few years now and things have been ok. This year something really changed with me and my urge to come out was too much. So I did to my gf. She was supportive at first but now I'm realizing she doesn't understand. She thinks I just want to be a man in a dress and has reiterated several times that she is not attracted to females. I should also mention we have been db for a looong time which is especially hard considering I am very sexual person. (Please no dirty dms, I'm not a desperate slut) I cannot go on any longer living like this. Feeling alone, lost, confused and borderline suicidally depressed I went in search of support.

Now I just feel like a piece of trash floating around on some stationary current of sorrow and displeasure. I feel so sad today. I woke up crying because I feel so lost.

I know it feels like it turns your world upside down and I know how much that scares you. You might feel at some point like you're forgetting who you really are. I want you to know that you're never losing who you really are. 

First off: these feelings have probably been there for a longer time than you think, except they were covered up by some good ol' repression or you didn't really notice them because your environment just accepted you being a tomboy, for instance. If you look back, you might discover that these feelings really didn't come out of the blue.

But the other things that make you *you* will not. Think about your taste in music. The shows you watch. The things you are passionate about. Those will probably not change. And what's more, your personality won't change. The delightful way you laugh at a dumb joke. The endearing way your eyes light up when you talk about something interesting. The lovely way you love those you hold dearly. Those will probably not change either.

And even if they do change, it's because that's who you (apparently) truly are. It's not like you're transitioning into a new person, you're transitioning into who you were inside all along. Transitioning into the person that you were meant to be all along.

2019-04-03 20:51:19,b93jk8,0,1,"So basically I've realized since I've started dating more that I'm typically more attracted to trans girls than cis girls. (I am a pansexual cis girl if that matters) I'm not 100% sure why this is but I have a few ideas. First, I've had better experiences with trans/nonbinary people being non judgemental towards my body type, most likely due to their own experiences with body acceptance. I also happened to have a crush on a trans girl at a very formative point in my journy of queerness and that might play a role. Those ideas sound ok to me. The third thing however is that I do think I'm more sexually attracted to penises, so when a girl happens to have one it works out in my favor. To me this doesn't feel like a fetishy thing because, even though it is about genitals, I would never discriminate one way or another based on genitals, I would never be embarrassed to date a trans girl publicly, and I don't see the person as only being their genitals. It just feels like any other physical and/or sexual preference to me (it's no be all end all). I really don't want to be problematic though and I'm really trying to be cautious and aware of my feelings and what they mean. I'm scared this may be seen as being a chaser and if so I'd want to change it about myself so I'm not a bad person. Idk if this makes a lot of sense but I wanted to get some perspective from people who are trans because I know this is probably a topic that cis people really don't have a place having an opinion on.

I really don't want to be problematic though and I'm really trying to be cautious and aware of my feelings and what they mean. I'm scared this may be seen as being a chaser and if so I'd want to change it about myself so I'm not a bad person. Idk if this makes a lot of sense but I wanted to get some perspective from people who are trans because I know this is probably a topic that cis people really don't have a place having an opinion on. Any advice or opinions are appreciated! Thanks!\n\nTLDR: I find myself more attracted to trans women that cis for a few reasons. I don't feel as though it's a fetish thing and is instead just a simple preference but I definitely don't want to be problematic so if it is problematic I want to change."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Is it ok to have a preference for dating trans people?

So, I got a few tidbits of, uh, astonishingly bad news last night... So I was talking with another trans friend, and she was wondering what my levels were. So I told her, ultimately... My T was at 226 (hers at 10) and my E was 38, and hers was 121.

So big fucking ouch. I felt like my drugs were doing nothing for me. That is a BULLSHIT high number for T, and I wanted to cry and cry and cry. The only real difference, and she had started after me, is that she‚Äôs on injections. And I‚Äôm on pills. My dosing is currently Spiro 200mg/day (I take it at night, if that means anything) and my Estradiol is 10MG (2 tabs AM, 3 PM). 

Seems like something isn‚Äôt working. Not sure what to do...

I was also wondering if anyone could possibly lead me in the direction of an insurance company that covers HRT a bit more than, uh, not at all... My insurance will not touch any of my HRT...

So, I finally started E and Spiro a few days ago, and it has been quite wonderful knowing things are changing! So woot for that! 

Anyways, while my Doctor was talking to myself about the side effects of Spiro, she mentioned my potassium intake. And how, and I quote, ""...shouldn't eat four or five banana's a day"". Now, I have no problem with that. But what concerns me is that fact that I have an incredibly high metabolism. Like three to four thousand calories a day. As far as I'm concerned, anywhere from 3500mg to 4700mg of Potassium should be consumed daily. The concern is that even with just the basic consumption of food, I'm getting very close to those 'limits'. Now, I'm by no means flipping out about this, and in retrospect I should've inquired further. However much I didn't realize how prevalent potassium is in food.

So with that, the title comes back into play. How much potassium should one consume? Anyone experience any side effects?

2019-04-06 05:56:57,ba1crb,9,8,"I am AFAB. I really feel as if I'm transgender (FtM). My problem is that my experience doesn't seem to fit the classic formula and I'm afraid I'm just kidding myself. 

When I was little I always wanted to watch Pokemon and superheroes and action movies. I wanted to play with hot wheels and play videogames. I preferred bugs and reptiles to horses and cats. 

But, I also watched Barbie and Bratz. I used to dress up and play princesses with my cousin, though I never dressed up as a princess outside of those occasions. I remember preferring the masculine things more, but it's not like I didn't enjoy the feminine things as well.

I didn't have a problem with puberty. In fact, I didn't care about my body image at all or what puberty entailed. It just didn't really register as anything special. I also had a period where I constantly wore makeup and girly clothes and would hardly be seen without them. In fact I still find makeup fun to do to this day.

But, my friends and I used to be super into roleplaying when we were younger and we'd have huge texting conversations dedicated to a roleplay. I can't ever remember playing a girl in those scenarios. I always play a boy when I can, whether it's the male version of myself or a character. Even now when I play D&amp;D I have much more fun when playing as a male. 

I stopped wearing girly stuff and started wearing baggy sweatshirts and pants to try and hide my body shape. I shaved off most of my hair and cut it down. I stopped wearing makeup for looks and have taken to only doing it for fun now or if I need to get dolled up for interviews and things. 

I've created this image of myself in my mind and it's a male now. I don't feel comfortable seeing myself as a girl and I dissociate with my body to keep from feeling dysphoric. That or avoid the mirror. I don't feel dysphoria often, but when I do it's so intense that I break down crying and choose not to go out in public, since I'm already feeling dysphoric and don't want to be misgendered as well.

When I think of my body I imagine having a man's body. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable to think of my genitals as female. In fact I can't remember the last time I used the proper feminine terms for my body, instead choosing to use male descriptors and finding them much more suitable. I used to be able to read ""x reader"" fics and enjoy them, but having the character that is supposed to be me referred to as female feels so wrong now that I can't read them anymore or I have to find the male versions, which are much harder to come by. 

In gym class or any class when they would sort boys and girls, I always hesitated and felt gravitated towards the boys side. I wanted to be on the boys side. I always felt like I was being shamed and forced into a role over something as simple as splitting up the class between boys and girls. When asked on forms what my gender is or what pronouns I prefer, I don't know what to say. I know that I want to say male, but for fear of being discriminated against, I write female.

I want to transition and would in a heartbeat, but I'm terrified that no matter how much surgery or treatment I get, I will never pass. I'm 5' even and my body is incredibly curvy. My face is far too soft to be masculine and my voice is a whole other story. If I could have been born a boy, I'm sure I would be much happier with myself and my body, but thinking of going through a full transition only to not pass terrifies me to the point that I put the thought away and convince myself I'm fine being female.

Similarly, I'm not good at asserting myself, so I'd have a rough time enforcing my pronouns and correcting people if need be. I hate to be a nag or feel like I've said something too many times and have gotten annoying with it. (Not saying that this is how I perceive other trans people when they correct me on pronouns, but it's how I feel I'm being percieved.) I don't mind female pronouns, but it always feels so much better when people refer to me with male pronouns or mistake me for a boy. I like it when I hear a kid ask their mom if I'm a boy or a girl, because it means I'm close to passing. I love when I work customer service and the customer calls me ""young man"" or something of the sort. I have even been going by a male name for 4 years now.

The problem is...I want a male body. But, I want to still wear girly things and makeup. I want to look like a boy, sound like a boy, and have a male body, but I also want to be able to wear makeup and a wig from time to time. I try to tell myself that that stuff doesn't mean I'm not trans, since I can wear makeup and dresses now, but I hate the body underneath. I want to look girly on rare occasions, but I don't want to be a girl.

Can I really say I'm transgender if my ideal image of myself is a male body who occasionally wears women's clothes and makeup? 

I mean my main style is graphic tees and baggy pants, but I'd miss being able to do makeup if I transitioned and I don't feel like that should be something I have to give up, but I also feel like...I'm just kidding myself.",trans,Am I just kidding myself?,1554555417.0,"{'created_utc': 1554530217, 'id': 'ba1crb', 'num_comments': 9, 'score': 8, 'selftext': 'I am AFAB.

 We don't have that much money to spend on me to transition unless I take out a loan from the bank, and that's not for a long time. Another thing is, I don't know when to transition.

A few examples are When I am 23 or 25 (Basically after I finish high school) and I also want to become a famous youtuber or twitch streamer (Which is hard and is like winning the lottery)

but if I do become a youtuber or twitch streamer I'm not sure whether if I should transition before or after starting an online career. 

The fear with both of these options is, If I start out transitioning while starting a youtube career I'm afraid of not becoming popular and no one paying attention to me, but if I get popular on youtube and then transition I'm afraid people will not look at me in the same light as they did once before.

People would still support me, it would be very different though. I know there is a lot of shitty people out in the world, and that is what scares me the most. Being hurt or killed because I'm misunderstood.

I know not everyone would support me being trans, but I feel like we would have to go 100 years in the future just to be able to be happy and live our lives the way we want to. 

Also, there's the other problem about finding a girl that is okay with me being trans and stays with me and is also loyal, but at the same time having an open marriage so we can both be happy and explore our sexualities. 

&amp;#x200B;

(My parents also love and support me so they would help me any way they can, not knowing what to do is the problem)

Another thing is, I don't know when to transition.\n\nA few examples are When I am 23 or 25 (Basically after I finish high school) and I also want to become a famous youtuber or twitch streamer (Which is hard and is like winning the lottery)\n\nbut if I do become a youtuber or twitch streamer I'm not sure whether if I should transition before or after starting an online career. \n\nThe fear with both of these options is, If I start out transitioning while starting a youtube career I'm afraid of not becoming popular and no one paying attention to me, but if I get popular on youtube and then transition I'm afraid people will not look at me in the same light as they did once before.\n\nPeople would still support me, it would be very different though. I know there is a lot of shitty people out in the world, and that is what scares me the most. Being hurt or killed because I'm misunderstood.\n\nI know not everyone would support me being trans, but I feel like we would have to go 100 years in the future just to be able to be happy and live our lives the way we want to. \n\nAlso, there's the other problem about finding a girl that is okay with me being trans and stays with me and is also loyal, but at the same time having an open marriage so we can both be happy and explore our sexualities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(My parents also love and support me so they would help me any way they can, not knowing what to do is the problem)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Also is it just me or does anyone else feel like we get hate because we are misunderstood or not the cis version of that gender?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll be back in a day on this post to see what people say. Thank you for taking the time to read and post by helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(P.S sorry if this post looks like a cluster fuck, idk how to paragraph) xd"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I'm a 17-year-old male and I need help."", 'created': 1554575598.0}"

I‚Äôm watching season 2 of The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina on Netflix. There‚Äôs a trans girl named Susie/Theo. I‚Äôm going to use her as my example. 
So Susie is now a boy who goes by Theo. Theo wears ‚Äúboys‚Äù clothes, has what is a traditionally ‚Äúboys‚Äù name, wants to change in the boys locker room, and his main conflict in the show is trying to get onto the boys basketball team. Theo is ridiculed and bullied. He feels he‚Äôs being denied his right to be a boy.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. Theo, formally Susan, now has a ‚Äúboys‚Äù name, wears ‚Äúboys‚Äù clothes, and wants to change in the boys locker room.

So Theo doesn‚Äôt feel like a girl. He feels like a boy. As he states in the show, he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable in ‚Äúgirls‚Äù clothes. He feels more comfortable in ‚Äúboys‚Äù clothes.

I‚Äôm a male. I am a man. If I grew my hair long, wore dresses, went by Susan, wore makeup, shaved my legs, and started dating men would I not be a man? It seems backwards to me that someone who changes these aspects of themselves ascribes to an outdated idea of what a man and women are.

2019-04-07 06:31:47,badmvq,4,4,"Howdy! I'm a 19 year old cis male living in Canada. I've lived cis all my life without any problems, always felt male, liked to look male, etc. However, all my life I've acted more typically feminine than my male friends - I like to sing Disney, I care more about organization and manners, and I think dyed hair, make-up, and jewelry is super cool (of those things I've only dyed my hair, though); and little thoughts would pop into my head, telling me things like ""but it would be cool to be a woman"" or ""I wish I was more feminine."" They mostly left my mind within minutes, though. But within the past 6 months I've been looking back on these thoughts as I begin to struggle with my identity.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with a Snapchat filter (yes, really). One my my friends thought it'd be funny to use one of the filters that made you look more feminine - eyelashes, lipstick, thinner jaw, etc. I laughed when she showed me, because that's what it was supposed to be. But internally, looking at the picture, it made me feel something different. That night I downloaded Snapchat just for the filter and had a mini-photoshoot in my bathroom. I even eventually talked myself into using rolled-up hand towels as fake breasts! (My pants were too tight to do the same for a bigger bum, though)

I did this a couple of nights before the need to be like that faded, and I assumed it was just a weird faze. But it didn't stop me from questioning it for the next few months, thinking about it. ""I'm not trans, though!"" I'd tell myself, ""I hadn't struggled with this for 19 years!"" It didn't stop the voices.

This past week the feelings came back a lot stronger. I tried to ignore it, but that didn't really work. So, to satisfy this feeling, I tried to photoshop a picture of myself to look like a lady (but I don't know how to use photo-editors very well, so that didn't work) I was desperate. The need to be different was exasperated after I saw a video online of someone stuffing balloons down their shirt to look like (clownishly large) breasts. Last night I tried the ol' towel method again, but it just wasn't enough.

So I went out to my local party store - it sells party stuff like streamers, candy, costumes, and - what I originally came there for - balloons. I went to the costume section and bought a cheap wig and some red face paint I had hoped to use as lipstick (the stuff was only $2! much cheaper than real lipstick), and then a pack of balloons (a 30 pack, in case I wanted to try different boob sizes)

I just got back from my little transition party in my bathroom mirror. I had never applied lipstick before - and the stuff I got didn't coat my lips well - but it was passable when I didn't wear my glasses. After trying on the wig, I immediately gained more respect for people who wear their hair long, because that was a mess to deal with. The balloons worked as intended, though I had to be extra careful with them so I wouldn't wake up my family.

After looking at myself in the mirror, finally getting the hair to cooperate, and striking many a pose, I felt sexy. It felt good. I was happy with it. (Though I'm still trying to figure out what to say to my mum if and when she finds the random wig and red paint, but oh well)

&amp;#x200B;

I was originally going to end this off asking you guys if this actually meant I was gender fluid, or what. But as I wrote it, I felt more and more comfortable applying the term to myself. If you've read all this, and you figure that that's wrong, and it doesn't make me gender-fluid, please make sure to tell me (you are the experts, after all!)

2019-04-07 15:36:11,bahgoo,1,3,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the title more than strange (or ridiculous) of this thread, it was a moment that I wanted to post here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few months ago I watched a movie called ""the Danish girl"" starring with Eddie Redmayne . As I quite appreciate this actor and as I was also curious about the story by itself ( a Danish painter who considered himself, by time to time, as a woman).  It didn't take long for me to choose this movie for my ""*Netflix-couch-potato-night*"". 

And even if I have to admit that the movie by itself was quite entertaining, I was really disappointed by the main character for which his complains was quite a pain in the a\*s. And to be honest I was clearly more concerned by the other character as I considered the behave the main character as quite selfish and destructive both to himself and to his close relatives. 

At first, I was quite like ""... *meh surely that the actor wasn't correctly leaded and that the script was kind of crappy when it comes about the main character*"". And perhaps this very first conclusion was right or at least was part of the answer of why this movie did not  touch me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still I am not really convinced by my own explanations and I 'm wondering if my lack of empathy was not, instead, due to a lack of knowledge about what transsexuality is.  I mean, I'm a man, with a functional ""*wee-wee*"" and questioning myself about my biological gender is not a thing that I do nor I did. And even if I would surely appreciate having more muscles and a being a little less chubby, I nether considered myself as under a treachery of mother nature who gave my a wrong body. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order to make a link to this title, in France we say ""*√™tre comme une poule devant une fourchette*"" which literally means ""being like a chicken in front of a fork"". And it is exactly my very feeling when it comes about trans people : I see it but still I can't understand it. Therefore, as I haven't got the foggiest idea of what transsexuality is and what trans people have to face it everyday, I don't have any position about it. 

As my mother always told me ""sweetheart you're dumb but fortunately clever enough to realize it"" I decided to create this thread with a simple but ambitious purpose : try to have a better understanding of what trans people have to struggle with on an everyday life but, even more importantly, to discuss with all of you on the most gentle way, full of dignity and mutual respect. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in order to sum-up : please, let me be less dumber by answering to these questions that did cross my mind as I write it down this thread : 

* How did you realize that you were in the wrong body ? Is it something you always knew of is it something that you realize after a specific situation ? 
* It is quite difficult for me to distinguish a person who have dysmorphia from other peoples who, for examples, simply rejects the gender ""etiquette"" or even from transvestite people. What is the difference ? 
* Still on the gender subject, when I think about transexual people I always have an image of a over-gendered person (eg. an an oversampled woman or a too muscular guy etc.) Is it a remarks you had or have to deal ? 
* In France, transsexuality seems to be dealt through a (very) long medical and psychiatrical process. This seems to be quite an issue fro many trans people but, on my mind, I think on the contrary that such process avoid any irreversible decisions made to quickly. Is such approach the same in other country ? 
* During and after an hormone therapy did you notice change (food tasting different, change in the mood and behaviour) etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before answering to these (surely stupid and overheard) questions,  I have some important things to say before laying down my (surely stupid) questions : 

1. Please notice that English is not my mother tongue. Many misspells , grammatical errors or even vocabulary clumsiness will certainly occur. Do not hesitate to correct me, I will greatly appreciate your corrections in order to improve my English skills. 
2. I will be honest : I'm fully ignorant but I surely know when you're into quite a sensitive subject and I'm quite sure that this threads have its foots fully into a world of sensitiveness. So if some of you consider my word as quite offensive or if you disagree with me, then let me know. 
3. This thread will be under the banner of courtesy and decency. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again thank you for your answers. I'm not sure that I may be able to fully understand you, but at least let us try ! :)

this is a small snippet from my stories that I feel would be pretty fitting here

for context: I write superheroes The gentleman is a villain in my stories that can disable the powers of supers, due to this, conflicts with him are either not conflicts at all and are more like debates.

Quinn has an assistant at his lab named Gloria, and Gentleman has an assistant that lives with him named George. Everything physically about all of them is the same, except for a few minor differences, but Gloria notices that George looks much different from her.

The gentleman was sitting in his penthouse. Quinn and Gloria had both broken in and Gent had caught them. Their powers are disabled and he was doing a big ole monologue when this moment began.

Gloria pointed to George. ""so wait. . ."" she said, her expression hidden behind her flat white mask. ""I was born a man in your universe?"" she seemed incredulous. Quinn and the Gentleman looked so similar, and yet George and Gloria looked nothing alike. George began to stutter slightly ""w-well I uh. . .

2019-04-08 14:05:31,bau7i3,0,4,"Hey everyone! So I don't usually post this kind of thing on Reddit, but I was talking to a trans friend of mine and explaining more or less what my stance on being non-binary was. For context I consider myself to be genderfluid existing between agender and demi-girl and I'll explain exactly what I mean by that in my chart.

https://i.redd.it/012wr70ko1r21.png

So I don't know if this idea has been proposed before or not (like I said I don't visit this subreddit) but this is pretty much what I came up with when trying to describe my understanding of gender. I'd like to know what the community thinks of it and see if they have any critiques or if this triangle leaves anything out that I wasn't aware of. Listed in the upper right corner I have some green symbols which are meant to represent methods of categorizing yourself on this chart. Don't take the symbols literally and only use squares or something they are just meant to represent a boundary.

&amp;#x200B;

So I mentioned earlier that I see myself as genderfluid and this is more or less what I envision when I say that.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1frlw0pap1r21.png

So note that I consider myself to exist somewhere within this area as indicated by the shape being filled. This pretty much means to me that on any given day I can be anywhere in this general area. I have gender flux listed as a highlighted area without this filled in section. That pretty much just indicates that your gender would land on the corners of the highlighted area to signify the extreme shifts between gender. Also important to note that this highlighted area doesn't have to be a triangle it can be a straight line if you want it to be, my reason for using a triangle was that it makes it easier to tell the difference between gender fluid and gender flux.

So my friend aligns herself with binary female which I envision as existing somewhere near the corners of the triangle overall. I don't really know if I consider agender to be a binary gender or not given that it is the lack of a gender, but I wanted my chart to reflect people who do transition between agender and something else so I do think it should be included in the chart. I also wanted the chart to be pretty simplified because I think that has more mainstream appeal than saying there are 2,000+ genders. I more or less see it as there are 2,000+ combinations for defining yourself on this chart and it really all comes down to how specific you'd like to get in terms of defining your dot or highlighted area. This one seems easy to understand for most people if they are at least open to the idea of a male/female gender spectrum. I should also note that I feel that more people in the world would identify as non-binary so take that as you will. I just see gender as a very nuanced thing as with most aspects of life. I don't know what I would consider the cut off points of where binary ends and non-binary begins though so... That's up for you all to decide I guess. I just made a chart and wanted to see what people thought of it. Thank you for taking the time to read and consider these ideas if you have. Also feel free to poke any holes in my chart or even propose a better chart if you are aware of one.

So I don't usually post this kind of thing on Reddit, but I was talking to a trans friend of mine and explaining more or less what my stance on being non-binary was. For context I consider myself to be genderfluid existing between agender and demi-girl and I'll explain exactly what I mean by that in my chart.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/012wr70ko1r21.png\n\nSo I don't know if this idea has been proposed before or not (like I said I don't visit this subreddit) but this is pretty much what I came up with when trying to describe my understanding of gender. I'd like to know what the community thinks of it and see if they have any critiques or if this triangle leaves anything out that I wasn't aware of. Listed in the upper right corner I have some green symbols which are meant to represent methods of categorizing yourself on this chart. Don't take the symbols literally and only use squares or something they are just meant to represent a boundary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I mentioned earlier that I see myself as genderfluid and this is more or less what I envision when I say that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1frlw0pap1r21.png\n\nSo note that I consider myself to exist somewhere within this area as indicated by the shape being filled. This pretty much means to me that on any given day I can be anywhere in this general area. I have gender flux listed as a highlighted area without this filled in section. That pretty much just indicates that your gender would land on the corners of the highlighted area to signify the extreme shifts between gender.

¬†
I wanted to send out a brief email in case you haven‚Äôt heard. I recently came out as transgender. To my friends and family outside of work ‚Äì my name is Veronica, Roni or Ronnie for short.
¬†
I realize that most people don‚Äôt know any trans people, or at least they don‚Äôt know that they know any trans people. I‚Äôm open about myself and my story if you ever want to talk outside of work.
¬†
Basically, what this means is that although my birth certificate and physiology indicate that I‚Äôm male, I‚Äôm actually a woman. I‚Äôve known since I was a kid, but I‚Äôm just now finally at a place in my life where I felt safe sharing this with the world. That‚Äôs kind of my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for starting this journey and sharing it with all of you ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a great feeling to carry around a secret like that every day!
¬†
Anyways ‚Äì I will be changing my name to Veronica. If you all could make an effort to refer to me by that name or by ‚ÄúRoni‚Äù that would be very appreciated. In addition, if you could start using female pronouns (she/her/hers instead of he/him/his) it would mean a lot to me. Slip ups are going to happen ‚Äì it‚Äôs habit, it‚Äôs normal, it‚Äôs not a big deal ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to apologize if it happens. It will also probably get easier as my appearance changes.
¬†
I haven‚Äôt yet shared this with candidates or clients yet ‚Äì but will be doing so in the near future.¬†
¬†
I‚Äôve also included a handful of resources (attached) if you‚Äôre interested in learning more.
¬†
Looking forward to continuing to work with each of you as a more complete version of myself,

2019-04-08 22:12:48,bazwr2,0,4,"I‚Äôm turning 19 this year and for the past 2 I‚Äôve been questioning my gender. I‚Äôve always been pretty clear on my sexuality but gender has always been a bit of a grey area in my brain; now looking back I think my sexuality is also linked to my ‚Äúgender doubts‚Äù. I‚Äôve always had the internal fight between the ideologies that ‚Äúgender is just a dna-thing and we can express ourselves however we want to‚Äù and ‚Äúwe live in a society where gender has a great impact and I can‚Äôt ignore that‚Äù - hence I define myself as Pansexual bc I couldn‚Äôt care less about genitals and I‚Äôm open to always respect my partner. 

Onto my actual gender... it‚Äôs a bit of a mess and I was hoping I could find someone with similar experiences! 

When I was a kid I never cared about clothes and just let my mom pick for me, resulting in a very feminine looking mini-me. Around ages 12 to 14 I picked what was in style at the moment for girls, as that‚Äôs what other people my gender did; but I never was ecstatic about my clothes and never considered it a way I could express myself through. I actually grew up to be a Tom-boy, resenting everything feminine and with the reputation of hating going shopping. I didn‚Äôt care at all about my appearance, although I didn‚Äôt hate the body I was in, just kind of accepted it. On the other side I love working repairs around the house with my dad and anything with wheels I could ride. To add to that, since I was little I‚Äôve loved to daydream and all of the stories in my head feature a masculine protagonist that I impersonate. 

Around age 16 I realized I had a bit of an obsession with anything masculine- I loved how the male body looked and felt a mixture of admiration and wanting to be like that. 

Around last year I let my brain actually listen to it and tried to explore the reasons why I never cared about how I looked and why I didn‚Äôt seem to want to express myself through my appearance (I‚Äôm a very artistic person and I love putting my weird twist on things I own). The conclusion I came up with is that I want to look more masculine. I went shopping without other people‚Äôs judgement in mind and actually enjoyed myself and found peculiar clothing I love (and other people think it‚Äôs ugly but I don‚Äôt care! ) BUT sometimes I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to buy something bc it made me look so female.. and I hate that. Sometimes I wish I could flatten out my boobs ( and I love boobs, just not on me all the time!). I‚Äôve also come to kind of hate my hips (I think they‚Äôre too wide to be androgynous) and how short i am, as I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever pass.

I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm really confused about what I‚Äôm feeling: is it repressed misogyny, disphoria or did I ignore my wishes to be androgynous for too long and now I have to deal with them all at once?

Are all genders classified in relation to the binary of male and female? To elaborate I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs only two genders , there are many but my observations have seen most are related to the binary to define them . 

To explain you have female and male genders, other genders are defined as Agender ( a lack of gender presentation) or Non-binary ( acknowledging a gender presentation strictly restricted to female or male genders) some of which are NB masc or NB femme or adrogyne, other cultures I‚Äôve looked at like Two-spirits in some but not all Native American cultures relate their gender towards this binary.

The main question I wanted to pose is, is their a gender identity not related to the binary of male and female? If not it would be possible to represent gender as a gradient with male on one side and female on the other , Demigirls, Demiboys, and Nonbinary would be spread through the middle likely overlapping with each other and a dot outside for Agender ,  i don‚Äôt know if such a graph would accurately represent all gender presentations and would likely need refinement regardless, but it would greatly help explain gender visually,

So I'm trans, f2m, and am thinking of transitioning. However, my main concern is if I can start taking T: I'm suffering from what is probably stress-related heart problems that surface whenever my school/work life gets too stressful (things like too much caffeine, loss of sleep and bad nutrition over lengthy times give me some slight symptoms which I can counter pretty well by taking generally good care of myself and exercising). 

The pains/symptoms are kind of like an aftermath/echo from a 2-year period when I was not taking good care of myself: learned my lesson and am now giving my body back the healthy lifestyle it needs. There are no heart diseases in my family that I should otherwise be worried about. I don't have any mental illnesses either that could explain the symptoms, and the tests taken with doctors haven't revealed anything severe in neither blood tests or the EKG.

So my question is pointed to those of you who have experiences of using T (especially if you might have heart or respiratory conditions or lowered physical condition by other means), what kind of health symptoms/effects you might have encountered and how severe the symptoms/changes have been.

I don't have any mental illnesses either that could explain the symptoms, and the tests taken with doctors haven't revealed anything severe in neither blood tests or the EKG.\n\nSo my question is pointed to those of you who have experiences of using T (especially if you might have heart or respiratory conditions or lowered physical condition by other means), what kind of health symptoms/effects you might have encountered and how severe the symptoms/changes have been. All answers are appreciated. I'm also interested in the respiratory symptoms because I've read that you might have symptoms like difficulties in breathing or even develop asthma, but apparently this is a very small percentage of people."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Experiences about T on your health', 'created': 1554853855.0}"

2019-04-09 19:44:31,bbcdvi,18,6,"I had this encounter at a university recently.  I saw someone who seemed, to my eyes, to be an extremely graceful, lovely woman. I was sort of taken aback by her sense of style (which was very resident with my own).  As I normally would, whenever I encounter someone who I think looks beautiful, or is dressed in a pleasing manner, I told her she looked very pretty.  It was only when I made eye contact with her that I happened to notice how tall she was; only then did I realize that she was likely trans.  I probably wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't looking for it, or there hadn't been any obvious cues.

Well we were speaking, I saw this *look* in her eyes; in an instant, we'd had this ""exchange of awareness"".  She realize that I had identified her as female organically- that I might have even assumed that she was born that way, and was fairly relieved.  All at once I saw joy, sorrow, hope and fear and her expression, and she very nervously started to ask me a question, but trailed off. It *seemed* as though she was starting to ask me whether or not I had realized that she was trans, and then decided against it. I questioned her on it, since she was mumbling and I didn't realize at first what she had been saying, and in a somewhat deflated tone she said ""never mind"".

I couldn't help but wonder if the reason she didn't want me to know that she was trans was because she was afraid of potential judgment. It seems more likely that she was anticipating a shift in my attitude- that she assumed I was only friendly toward her because I apparently didn't realize that she was trans.

In that moment, I wasn't really sure what to say. What would've been more reassuring? To directly acknowledge that she was trans, and therefore be one of the people who supports her/someone she is able to potentially relax around? Or to leave it alone? What might've been more hurtful? Yet another reminder of the fact that she wasn't born female (ie: ""where you about to say that you're trans?""), or if he ambiguity of wondering whether or not she was expected to *hide* this aspect of her being?

2019-04-09 20:13:10,bbcqmv,6,3,"So, I recently began to question because I have noticed that when doing sexual activities, I always image myself as a female. wanting breasts and curves and everything a woman has. I usually experience body disphoria after this. However, any other time, I am a functional male and I don't think about it. I'm happy with my life at the moment, but I'm beginning to notice increasing thoughts of being a girl in different aspects of life. for example, feeling envious of girls talking about leggings, wanting to have breasts and, when going to the toilet, feeling uncomfortably aware of my genetalia.

This has been occurring for the past few months now, and I'm scared. I'm content with myself but I'm not sure if identifying as trans would make me feel any better or worse.
Thing is, I don't really want to do ""girly things"". I just sometimes want a body of a woman, and wear some feminine clothes.

My confusion has also been twisted by social media. for example, seeing a picture of a fit dude makes me feel like
""damn, he is good looking... I could try and work out to look like him and I'd feel good about it.""
but I could say the exact same about a picture of a girl.

I wouldn't mind taking HRT to feminise myself but firstly it's almost impossible for me to get and I'd be scared of people noticing the effects, especially my family.

I've heard of a phrase called ""autogynephilia"" and I'm not sure if this applies to me or if the whole thing is just not real.

sorry if this was a waste of time. just kinda needed to let this out somehow.

Hello. I‚Äôm a 17 year old trans guy. A have a bad and abusive relationship with my mother, who is a bigot, and a good relationship with my father.

My dad is already suing my mom for custody and has a court date tomorrow. I know you might be thinking. It‚Äôs pointless and expensive to try to get custody of me at my age. I don‚Äôt need that lecture as he‚Äôs already doing it and set on doing so.

Here‚Äôs the thing: he doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm trans. And he wants me to help him compile a list of ‚Äúgrievances‚Äù against my mother so he has a better chance of getting custody.

I‚Äôm unsure that I should come out to him. Part of me feels like he would have a better chance of getting custody if the judge knew I was trans and that my mom is really bigoted towards trans people. But another part of me worries that the judge will be transphobic too and think I‚Äôm lying and just trying to live with someone who will ‚Äúenable my disorder.‚Äù

I‚Äôm also worried if he doesn‚Äôt get custody. Then my mom will find out I‚Äôm trans as well and probably tell the rest of my family, who are also transphobic.

There‚Äôs about 17 hours until the hearing, and I can realistically come out to him no later than about 11-13 hours from now, and I‚Äôm still undecided.

If you have any advice, or have been in a situation like this before, could you share? I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I just want to know what other people would do in this situation. Just support is also appreciated.

I'm currently studying psychology of gender and it's fantastic, I used to think that wanting to be transgender was a product of gender dysphoria - as in the desire to be of a different gender was due to pathological reasons. Now.. I think that was incredibly ignorant of me and that there is nothing abnormal about the desire to be a different gender. 

All of this information I'm learning about is coming from my cisgendered professor, and I would greatly appreciate your views.

While regularly doing weekly IM injections without missing a dose, somehow, while around people who didn't accept me as a man, my facial hair randomly thinned, I became less vascular, my hair became soft instead of coarse, the hair on my ass disappeared, my voice became less deep, and my body shape went more feminine.

It has been horrifying, to say the least.

I had bloodwork done that showed my hormone levels were both at nearly 0, like a dead person (?), and so I started topical testosterone; after 6-9 months, I had bloodwork done (2 months ago) and my testosterone is half of what it used to be, while the estrogen is, thankfully, low.

The bloodwork didn't explain the changes, and nobody is taking me seriously, from community to healthcare, despite having picture evidence.

This is a sad rant

Just went for a haircut to trim up some bad hairs. Was going fine until she took down the pins from my hair holding it up, and gave me a mkrror to see what she was asking me for. There, right smack dab in the middle of my head, was a bald spot. I feel I have beautiful, wonderful hair, and it's just... Going away.

I beleive you, Melissa, and sorry for ending the haircut early, but you probably have no idea what I'm feeling right now (I paid for her work, I promise).

Even better is I lost my job a couple months ago, I picked up another but with only 20 hours a week at minimum wage, behind a lot on my rent, and I'm not even close to starting therapy and counseling, let alone bloodwork, HRT, and hair replacement whatever.

So I'm AMAB, and started actually questioning my gender very recently after having spent a long time convincing myself I'm cis. There's a lot going on in my head right now, but there's one specific thing that I think I want to talk about, because I'm not sure of its implications.

Right now I identify as straight, meaning I'll probably be a lesbian if I transition. This is relevant to the Thing I'm about to talk about, which is a thing that may have been 'Trans foreshadowing', or it may not have been.

When I was a few years younger than I am now (I'm still young now, whatever) I used to have these, daydreams I guess, where I would wake up in the body of a girl I had a crush on at the time. It wasn't always the same girl, you know how crushes are.

Now, the thing with these fantasies was: they were usually somewhat sexual in nature, often involving masturbation. Because of this fact, I don't know if these fantasies were the result of me wanting to be a woman, or just me being a straight male teenager.

On top of that, the fantasies frequently involved trying to switch back, but I think that was more of a ""returning to 'me'"" thing than a ""returning to male"" thing.

2019-04-13 15:30:53,bcrnzo,1,4,"Sorry this is a shitty story, I just had to share it cus it happened last night and I am still angry and sad.

Went to my favorite bar last night, not an lgbtq+ bar, but I know a lot of the bartenders and they are good people and most know what I am trans and are supportive, for cis people.  Bartender says I look pretty and complements my hair. Then he says that he is excited I am transitioning and tells me that he's there for me if I ever need anything.  He seems drunk but is super nice, I am feeling great.  Then he says he has a trans niece who is 15, and asks me if she can call me.  Naturally I tell him I can help in any way and there she can call or text any time.  Seems like she has just came out, but her mom was being supportive and he sounded supportive.  I was psyched, I wanted to be there for her any way I could and help her get through stuff since I assume coming at 15 would be intense and people at school are really shitty.

Next thing I know he is not working and come up crying, I take him outside the bar and he just looks at me with this face I won't forget and says that she's gone.  That she killed herself.

I was always so sad that I missed out growing up female.  I came out recently at 29 and it's been pretty easy for me since I have already chosen good people as my friends who have been supportive so I haven't really experienced much transphobia.

Now I don't even know how to feel.  I'm fucking pissed, how dare these people she went to school with make her go this far and feel this way.  Why is this shit still happening?

I don't really have much to say, just needed to vent this.  I want to do something to help in some way to keep things like this from happening, but I don't know how.

2019-04-13 23:58:58,bcwz1l,4,2,"Hi, I‚Äôm reposting from another sub because I haven‚Äôt received much advice and I‚Äôm quite desperate. (18 y/o trans guy, out since I was 15).

I made this post (/r/asktransgender/comments/az5o4s/am_i_really_transgender/) some weeks ago because I started to question whether I was really trans. After the positive messages I felt better and stopped thinking about it, but now I‚Äôm back at it and it‚Äôs worse than before.

My mind keeps insisting I‚Äôm a woman, I keep misgendering myself unconsciously and even going as far as labeling my attraction for girls as ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù and my attraction for guys as ‚Äústraight‚Äù. It‚Äôs horrible and it distresses me to no end, but at this point I can‚Äôt even truly consider myself a real man/male, because my body doesn't feel appropriate. I know I‚Äôm a man, or so I want to believe, but I can‚Äôt fight back the other thoughts and it makes me confused.

I look at other guys and wish I could be like them. But then I look at girls and wish I could be like them too.

I‚Äôve been reading detransition stories, but I can‚Äôt really relate to them. It‚Äôs all about butches who define themselves as being confused, ‚Äútransitioning‚Äù to escape gender roles and avoid judgement for being masculine, or stories about wanting to escape patriarchal oppression and internal misogyny. I‚Äôve never been stereotypically masculine and I don‚Äôt believe in gender roles, so I know that‚Äôs not a problem. I‚Äôve never been exclusively attracted to women, so it‚Äôs not about being ashamed of my sexuality. I‚Äôve never felt being a man would make my life easier (it sure would, but it‚Äôs not something I care about), but maybe I do have internalized misogyny? I don‚Äôt know. I look at muscled women, masculine women, lesbians, bisexual girls, physically androgynous women and any other type of women that aren‚Äôt ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù and I think they‚Äôre pretty cool. In a way I wish I could be like them, but I know it‚Äôs not possible because I don‚Äôt feel like a woman.

Before coming out I had a period of hyper femininity and it wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been thinking of trying it out again... It scares me though. If it wasn‚Äôt for me and I went like that in public I‚Äôd freak out, and dressing up like I used to in private wouldn‚Äôt really tell me anything.

Is my hatred for my body even real? What if I‚Äôve just convinced myself I‚Äôm trans and therefore, to pretend discomfort? Could it be possible being happy with your assigned gender while desiring being the other sex? At this point I even wonder if I really dislike my body and if I‚Äôd just rather have a male one, or if I‚Äôm a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù who simply wouldn‚Äôt like to be treated or perceived as such (like he/him lesbians and all that).

As a side note, I‚Äôm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but I started completely skipping my meds since December (bad decision, I know, no need for lectures). I tend to expose myself and participate in political discourse too, which means I often read transphobic things. Could this be influencing my feelings? Am I genuinely confused/questioning, or is it the dysphoria (no longer suppressed by meds) and internalized transphobia that is fueling my fears and doubts? In case of the latter, any tips on how to cope and stop invalidating myself?

I avoid looking in mirrors everyday and seeing pictures of myself disgusts me. 

I‚Äôm scared I might have either gender dysphoria or body dysmorphia. I don‚Äôt know a lot about either so I‚Äôm incredibly unsure, and I feel like assuming it‚Äôs one when it might not be is a horrible idea.

2019-04-14 04:52:26,bczdyp,5,3,"Hi there,

So here's my situation: I'm about to go to Spain (flying out 4 days from now) to get FFS with FacialTeam. Based on the results I expect, I'll be outed pretty much within seconds of coming back. There's a good chance that my voice will MOSTLY pass (hopefully I'll be far enough out from surgery that this won't be an issue) but that's it. My body is maaaybe decently well passing if you ignore the mediocre boobs. I have a limited wardrobe but it'll do for work - I'll have some time to pick up a few extra pairs of good jeans and that sort of thing. I'll hopefully know some basic makeup by that time, too (I've got an in-person course scheduled + already done some research).

Essentially, this is gonna be tough. Most likely, I'm walking into being a non-passing visibly trans cashier. Oh boy.

But I do have some advantages going for me. My employers/employees already know I'm quite feminine - I'm also very open about being bi to a 100% positive response so far. I'm also not bothered with being misgendered early - it's just the direct hostility I'm not sure I'm ready for.

As I see it, I have a few approaches to this situation.

1. The nuclear option: I don't tell anyone and just show up to work looking all purty with a new face.
2. The stealthy nuclear option: I don't tell anyone and just try to get away with being androgynous while I cover all the rest of my bases.
3. The totally-what-I-should-do-but-dreading-this-email option: Email my boss, and show up to work in a pride pin and some dope clothes, and let the world come at me.
4. The wuss-out-but-also-reasonable option: Email my boss, dress androgynous, answer questions directly, and try to be a little less conspicuously feminine so fewer customers give me shit.

2019-04-14 16:35:34,bd4krv,0,1,"I started transition 11 years ago. I've gotten a lot of attention, mostly from men, but from some women too. Most of them want the same thing from me: to top them. I kind of look like an amazon so I guess it makes sense that that is the attention I am getting.

The problem is that I've never really stuck my junk into someone else and I have had very few sexual partners or intimate experiences because I haven't wanted to top and I guess I have needed a more emotional connection to feel like it's worth it.

I'm only getting older, though, and I don't want to miss out any more. I've been wondering if I just have things backwards and that really, in this current age, sex comes before emotional investment. I've been struggling with the idea of actually using my junk to stick into someone and I don't think there's any way to do it without dissociating. Maybe I can make some people happy and not be considered such a prude.

Am I worrying about this too much? Is dissociation actually more common and not that big of a deal? Is it what I *should* be doing anyway because having a happy partner should be more important? Does it actually work?

I really don't want to hear things like ""you shouldn't be dissociating"" and ""it's not good for you"". Yeah, ok, I get it. Whatever. I'm also alone and have been my whole life. Maybe I just need to get over myself, bite the bullet, and think of England. Maybe it's just the price I have to pay to not be alone anymore.

2019-04-14 16:58:42,bd4tle,5,0,"hello people of r/trans im a curious 18 year old cis male who is trying to write a commentary or at least a clear explanation of various topic. ive been working on it fo about 5 month now and i plan to finish it when im probably 25 because of well the depths of the subjects i talk about and how much in depth i want to go. 

one of those topic is the subject of gender identity and sexuality. so i have a couple of questions regarding the trans perspective and the effects of others who do not share this perspective on the behaviours of these people. so if u people will have me i have some questions.

1. Does the aesthethic of a ""male"" or ""female""  matter to u in terms of helping u pass and if so to what degree?

2. Various people in ur life will say u dont meet the perceptional cues needed to consider u male enough or female enough ( whatever those definitions may be) what weights does it have in ur eyes? and how does this affect u playing into the aesthetic i refered to in the previous question?

3. Various people have different weights on what these perceptional cues are, so are they justified in saying the trans individual doesn‚Äôt meet said standard?. 

4. If the answer to the question \[ii\] is yes then does that then mean that certain perceptional cues have more value than others? If yes do we list them? And which ones have more value and why?

5. If you answer to the question \[ii\] is no then how can we reconcile with these individuals in their wrong doing? Do we still need to define the specific cues that matter and why? Do we need to reconcile with the perceiver in his value of the cues or with the trans individual in the expression of the right cues?

some of the questions may be open ended or may seem obvious but i dont belive the answer is always clear cut. and im trying to create a stable unchanging/reliable standard. i dont mean to offend anyone with the questions. im simply trying to create at least a fair describtion. if some of the questions are too open ended or too vague u can point out how and ill do my best to clarify. if u outright dont understand ill also try to explain further. if its stupid then im sorry for asking stupid questions lol.",trans,I have some inquiries about the trans perspective.,1555286322.0,"{'created_utc': 1555261122, 'id': 'bd4tle', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'hello people of r/trans im a curious 18 year old cis male who is trying to write a commentary or at least a clear explanation of various topic. ive been working on it fo about 5 month now and i plan to finish it when im probably 25 because of well the depths of the subjects i talk about and how much in depth i want to go. \n\none of those topic is the subject of gender identity and sexuality. so i have a couple of questions regarding the trans perspective and the effects of others who do not share this perspective on the behaviours of these people. so if u people will have me i have some questions.\n\n1.

As far as the social aspects of being a woman there\'s definitely parts I\'d enjoy but they don\'t make up the bulk of my ""desires"" I guess.\n\nI guess I\'m not sure how to feel because autogynephilia seems like it\'s the closest thing to me - I like the idea of being a woman but it ebbs and flows and I\'m probably idealizing it. But part of me thinks it may be more than that. Guess I\'ll put it in the same boat as my sexuality which seems to be ""good luck figuring that out"".\n\nSorry for the rambling but I\'ve had a really stressful week and for some reason these feings are hitting me now that haven\'t been present in months.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Is autogynephilia a thing?', 'created': 1555329587.0}"

I am the president of a collegiate student organization that advocates for and spreads awareness of issues affecting women and women identifying people around the world.  To do this we operate in committees corresponding to particular issues, one of them being Women‚Äôs Health.

Currently, our executive board is having a discussion about renaming our Women‚Äôs Health Committee to just the Health Committee. Previously this committee was called the Reproductive Health Committee but we changed it to its current title because not all women have reproductive abilities and wanted to be more trans inclusive. 

Now the discussion has shifted to dropping women from the title all together since some health issues that typically affect cis women can also affect trans men. I have no problem with incorporating trans men and other AFAB individuals into the dialogue if we‚Äôre doing an event on a typical women‚Äôs health issue that affects them as well, however, it‚Äôs really important to me that we stay focused on our mission which is to advocate for women and women identifying people.

My position is that we should limit the scope of the committee to women and women identifying people and include AFAB people in dialogue when it‚Äôs appropriate. I feel like if we drop women from the title of the committee it not only deviates from the focus our mission but it also can create the dangerous assertion that trans men or other AFAB people are actually women by proxy and want to avoid

I just want to ensure that were being inclusive and sensitive to trans folks while still staying true to our mission of advocating on the behalf of women and women identifying people. Since I am a cis woman can provide no perspective on how this actually affects the individuals that are the subject of the discussion, I wanted to get some thoughts that are fare more valid than my own.

2019-04-16 23:48:59,be0ywp,0,5,"I swear, the question of whether or not I should get bottom surgery drives me up the damn wall. The previous concern of ""I don't know if it will feel like I think it will,"" is basically gone. I honestly don't care about how it feels, so much as I care about functionality and appearance. What I have is annoying, ugly, doesn't fit the body I wish to and damn near already have, already kinda ruined because previous Christianity, and useless outside of making it slightly quicker to urinate (not that that matters in public bathrooms where hurrying up is actually useful, and standing up can potentially discomfort others). And while I guess it isn't the end of the world if I have it, I still kind of really want it gone. That being said... It's basically impossible. Getting a surgery before graduation is impossible because it's illegal (and it would be stupid of me to consider). Getting it soon after graduation would also be stupid because I won't have any money, and it would require taking months off of college, which is basically throwing money down the drain. Getting it soon after I move on to bigger jobs would be difficult because those jobs in question require constant attendance, and frankly I want to get my big projects started by the time I'm 40. Getting it while doing my big projects would be ESPECIALLY stupid given those require even MORE constant attendance. And once I'm retired? Well, that, just kinda sounds too little too late. I'll be damn near death. I will have reluctantly tolerated the hand I've been dealt with not enough of my life left to make that final step worthwhile.

The previous concern of ""I don\'t know if it will feel like I think it will,"" is basically gone. I honestly don\'t care about how it feels, so much as I care about functionality and appearance. What I have is annoying, ugly, doesn\'t fit the body I wish to and damn near already have, already kinda ruined because previous Christianity, and useless outside of making it slightly quicker to urinate (not that that matters in public bathrooms where hurrying up is actually useful, and standing up can potentially discomfort others). And while I guess it isn\'t the end of the world if I have it, I still kind of really want it gone. That being said... It\'s basically impossible. Getting a surgery before graduation is impossible because it\'s illegal (and it would be stupid of me to consider). Getting it soon after graduation would also be stupid because I won\'t have any money, and it would require taking months off of college, which is basically throwing money down the drain. Getting it soon after I move on to bigger jobs would be difficult because those jobs in question require constant attendance, and frankly I want to get my big projects started by the time I\'m 40. Getting it while doing my big projects would be ESPECIALLY stupid given those require even MORE constant attendance. And once I\'m retired? Well, that, just kinda sounds too little too late.

it's too late to start calling courts and city halls right now so im trying to start the process to see if ANYBODY has any information. i've already changed my name legally and ive been on hormones for 3 months, but i want to help my boyfriend who is frustrated and left in the dust by the people around him who wont support him.

if anybody has ANY information about mississippi state laws, how he can file a petition for a name change, any fees as well including filing fees and newspaper publication fees, that would be so helpful. if you could spread this to any trans people in mississippi and the surrounding states to see if i can get any insight on the process there, that would also be great. being in massachusetts it's significantly easier, as ive had an LGBT support group behind me the whole time along with several helpful workers and therapists.

One of my best friends' dysphoria has evidently gotten very bad the past few weeks and I just found out yesterday. It is now to the point where he literally cannot function without his binder on. His general body image issues are also not helping, as he is not a very masculine-presenting guy despite being a transman and societal pressures on what ""male"" looks like make him feel like shit because he just flat-out doesn't have that body type. He's not allowed to get top surgery (the only surgery he wants) or even start a GoFundMe for it until puberty is over because of his mom not understanding and not being willing to try to understand. Same with getting testosterone. 

What's more and worse is that he has a history of self-harm. He's been ""clean"" for awhile now and got rid of his blades and stuff but he's now starting to feel the need to start doing it again. He promised me he won't because he doesn't have anything to do it with, and I take his word. I'm family-friends with our town's police chief and many of the officers, so I can get a detail out to his house in an instant if it was really dire anyhow. 

But my question is: how can I help? I'm the only person he is comfortable ranting to about all this (that's sort of my role through my whole friend group), but I feel like all I can say is ""That sucks"" or ""Everything's gonna be OK"" and I know that's not enough. As a cis man, its tough for me to really understand what he's going through and i want to be able to help, but with his mom pretty much not giving a shit about his mental health it's very tough. What can I do to help him? 

P.S. We are both teenagers so that limits his options further. If there's any more info that would be helpful, please let me know.",trans,Helping friend with dysphoria,1555619530.0,"{'created_utc': 1555594330, 'id': 'bellkw', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'Crosspost from r/lgbt.

I am coming here to bring a question that I've pestered many friends and otherwise with for probably 5 years now. I may be transgender, but I don't know how to know. I am born male, and currently am biologically, but over the past years through high school I have really came in touch with my feminine side, and for the past 4 or 5 years of fascination, have always been juggling with the idea that I could be trans. Now I want to say I have no problem with the fact that I could be, but I really dont want to jump the gun. Ive struggled with depression for a little longer than what ive had these thoughts, but while many of my issues came and went, this gender disconnect had always been there. I want to say this dilemma is the current cause of my depression, along with my anxiety. I have recently over the past year really been trying to explore that side of myself, through crossdressing and whatnot. I am affectionately the ""trap"" of my friends group (a term i used first, and one we all use lovingly and kept separate from trans people), and while we all like to use that sort of trope, they also understand that it does go deeper than just being a crossdresser and they have all been incredibly supportive. Theyve encouraged me to feel comfortable and dress around them and they were the first group ive ever crossdressed with, and it felt wonderful, and fun, and exciting. Additionally ive also been playing with using she/her pronouns, and when someone does use them for me it makes me light up tbh. I love getting ma'am-ed by accident bc of my long hair, or when people say they thought I was a girl... But I'm not sure if all of that is because I enjoy the attention? Or maybe the illusion i give off? Or is it because I really am a girl at my heart? Ive consulted a lot of friends and have done a lot of soul searching... But idk how to know...

&amp;#x200B;

just an hour ago i had a meeting with someone who was helping me with community resources, and asked her to help me decide via saying the names out loud as though greeting me.

I've never really been comfortable being myself and in that body and it got to boiling point where I didn't understand what I was and I couldn't bear to be out for too long at a time before I just couldn't. (Luckily my school has a sort of place you can relax/study if you need it, I'm so thankful for that) The pressure of being that persona to everyone was to the point where I couldn't breathe or concentrate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at the same time I had nearly no contact with my girlfriend because not only had I not seen her in a long time, I had no phone/computer to text and the calls kept becoming more and more sparse and short. (Which I regret so god damn much) I couldn't handle talking to her because she knew me as what I was not and talking to her brought out the feeling of what I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned however that not talking at all made it worse between us and I couldn't really progress at all due to talking to her as someone I'm not and not getting help from someone who is really close to me. I told her exactly what was going on and she understood very well, and has supported me so much.

&amp;#x200B;

She offered letting me be referred to as she/her for a day which I took straight away. She gave me suggestions for female names which made me incredibly happy. She helped with feeling more female. (Shaving, clothing, she said we're gonna go shopping for panties and bras) When we were talking about going out she said that she's gonna go out with her **girlfriend.** She said that and it made me so crazy happy I couldn't stop crying.

I feel like I'm just making up my ""dysphoria"" because I want to be edgy. I've cried over this confusion many times.

I wonder if this is due to societal expectations of what a woman or a man is and should look like etc.

The only difference aside from biological between men and women are the genders that society created. Isn't gender supposed to be a societal construct? Then why do trans people exist? If there were no societal constructs for gender, would there be less trans people or none at all because we'd just be people, not men and women?

I want to know your experiences and why you first thought you weren't the gender you were born with. What was it that made you think that? I want to know what I am.

I hope I didn't phrase this in a disrespectful way, I'm genuinely curious and want to know.",trans,How much does society influence your decision to be trans?,1555851846.0,"{'created_utc': 1555826646, 'id': 'bflvc6', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'This question may sound stupid and offensive but l just hear me out for a moment.\n\nThis is a serious question I have.

2019-04-21 23:32:55,bfv5ge,9,9,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm gonna try to condense this as short as I possibly can so bare with me please. I‚Äôm currently 25 years old and live in Southern California. For years I‚Äôve been what I considered to be a ‚Äúfeminine boy‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt really have a name for what I was to be honest other than that. I went with boy because that‚Äôs what I was assigned at birth. Now for a little back story. As a child I always saw my idols as being women. Sailor moon was someone I looked up to greatly. I wanted to be like her so bad. Wear a cute outfit and fight evil. I was so intrigued with the idea of being a powerful girl. Since preschool all my friends were girls. I started to become very shy around males (I still am till this day) and would get anxiety when I would be put in groups with them.  I was also really interested in makeup. I didn‚Äôt really care for the clothes though. Growing up it was evident I was not even remotely close to being masculine. I would hate having facial hair (which btw I really want to get removed via laser still) and would constantly shave everything. Also a red flag for me was when I started being referred to as a ‚Äúman‚Äù by my family. I would shudder at that thought. I even remember telling my mom once to just please call me a boy as if a boy wasn‚Äôt as bad as a man in my head. Still till this day I absolutely hate it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a man at all. The thing is I don‚Äôt (know) think I‚Äôm a woman either. Yes I love generally feminine things but I don‚Äôt necessarily care for being a women but the thing is I don‚Äôt think or care for being a guy. I think the proper name is non binary or non conforming I‚Äôm not too sure? I recently finally went to a therapist because I was over being stressed everyday. See I‚Äôm the type of person that researches a bunch and is really introverted so not a lot of people even know. Anyways I see this therapist and I tell him how I‚Äôm feeling and he looks so confused. I told him I thought I was trans and how I wasn‚Äôt necessarily a girl but not a guy and that I wanted to keep my genitalia but start hormones.

For some background on my situation, here's an older post I made (sorry if links aren't allowed, I just don't want to copy-paste it into this, or type it out again as it's pretty long to cover all the crap)[https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/alya8y/in\_need\_of\_advice/efkt0ck/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/alya8y/in_need_of_advice/efkt0ck/?context=3)

I was going to post sooner, however, I did have a major crisis and got out of an inpatient stay for my other mental health problems at the end of February. More has added into this story, and I'm at a loss. No worries, I'm not in crisis or anything that would require a medical professional. I'm now terrified of my situation.

Changes worth noting:

\-I have landed a full-time job

\-I now have a vehicle, however, it needs a lot of work done and I cannot use it to travel long distances (meaning for me around 20 miles)

\-I never moved out, but I'll get into that a bit more.

Just to save myself later on - I'm no longer even socially transitioning due to other beliefs coming to life by those around me. It's eating me alive and I'm working on budgeting in a psychiatrist to hopefully help me. I'm also moving in with my SO who keeps re-enforcing that they're not going anywhere, despite everything. I'm still insanely uncomfortable there and it's only gotta worsen with some family issues that has happened within that household. I'm pretty sure other members in the house have started using meth again, and it's extremely crammed as is with space. One that's a major issue's room is actually right next to mine and my SO's, he's someone with a severe learning disability and acts very lewd around me and others constantly. I do have a past with abuse of the same nature. I would move out completely, but now my family has told me I'm not allowed to move out.  
Another major thing is my grandmother has now bluntly said, word for word ""all these transgenders should be murdered, they are a disgrace and deserve to be punished by death.""

I'm not safe anywhere, and I know my mental health is only going to get worse at this point. I don't know if I should give up, bite my tongue, and start acting in the image my family/SO prefers, or really what to do. I've had more bills come up, I'm being garnished, and I really don't make enough to survive alone. I bring home maybe $900 a month so saving up and moving away just isn't an option.

One Halloween back in college, a girl friend and I swapped clothes and dressed each other up as the other's gender as a costume. She did a really good job, straightening my hair and doing my makeup, to the point where people at parties who didn't already know me (and even one who did) just thought I was some girl who didn't get dressed up as anything, and it turned out, that made me really happy. 

Whenever I see women on TV or out in public or basically anywhere, my first thought is always, ""I wish I looked like that"". It's a pang of sadness every time, but every couple months, it'll send me into a deeper funk for a few weeks, and I'll go back to reading about transitioning and considering whether I should be doing something.

2019-04-24 14:33:56,bgvc9u,19,10,"Hi guys. 

I really need to figure out if I'm wrong or not. (TL;DR below)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been through my ""phase"" when I was younger with depression lasting from when I was 8 to 21. (Only thing that changed was my girlfriend)

Although I was diagnosed with Asperger due to my depression and my passion for music + my social skills when I was young. (I'm extremely extrovert now and can't live a day without socializing)

&amp;#x200B;

I came out to my girlfriend about my dysphoria and that I've always felt like a woman but never appreciated my body or the way society wants me to be like (the standard guy meets girl, marriage, do guy things and such).

She was extremely supportive and has been helping me the past weeks until I had an appointment with my doctor to get through the system with ""diagnosis"" and hormones...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I was at the doctor today and he said it was common for people (especially cis men) with Asperger to be questioning their gender and have gender dysphoria despite not wishing to transition... He was very reluctant to send me further to a psychiatrist that would do an evaluation of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a hundred percent sure that I'm a woman inside and that its want I want to do but I'm afraid they will judge my Asperger Syndrome and not judge me on my wishes and dire need of help.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him everything, that I was suicidal in periods and that I literally think that without the treatment, I'll do something harmful to myself because I can't stand to live in this situation any longer and that I want treatment within the next year.

2019-04-24 19:12:57,bgyohl,2,3,"Sorry if this isn't the correct place for this post and I'm taking up space. This is my first post to reddit. I joined earlier today.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bisexual cis? woman? and I'm feeling extremely confused and hoping members of this community might be willing to help. I recently became good friends with a trans woman and then developed some extremely, inappropriately intense feelings for her (especially inappropriate because I am married to a man I love). I've had crushes before but this is the first time I believe I would have actually gone through with anything physical if she'd felt about me the way I feel about her. It was unbelievably intense, she pushed back, we talked about it, I also really really like her as a friend and a person so we kept hanging out.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on some conversations, primarily although at the time unconsciously initiated by me, I think it's possible that the reason my feelings were so intense was because it felt like we had a lot of shared experiences in terms of how we felt about ourselves and our bodies. My feelings mellowed a bit and lost the crazy intensity but I was still pretty into her. I also was daydreaming at some point and picked a name that would be my boy name although obviously I'm not a boy, but I told her and she started using that name and it felt AMAZING. Hearing (seeing in texts) myself referred to by that name gave me intense feelings, literally physical sensations. We also went shopping and I put on a men's shirt and tie and wow it felt really good. We hung out with some friends, I got drunk and I'm not exactly sure what happened but I think she saw me looking at her and figured out that I still have pretty strong feelings so we're going to take a few weeks apart so I can sort myself out, which is definitely the right choice and honestly I'm ashamed this is a boundary she has to set. I love my husband and I have never come particularly close to anything like this before. I need to get over it and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

So the problem is, I don't know if the feelings are because I like her so much or if I am so intensely drawn to her because of something in me. One hard thing is since we're not talking for a few weeks no one will call me by my other name but I can't tell anyone else and I probably never will. I don't know if I liked hearing it because I have such ridiculous feelings and her having a special name for me tapped into that, or if it's the name itself. I've also spent the last few days feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I actually don't think I'm trans. I hate my body but only because it's fat and disgusting and hairy, not because it's female. I don't hate my boobs and I like painting my toenails and I've enjoyed wearing makeup sometimes, and I don't think I want to be physically male. I really don't think I want a penis. I think I like attention and talking about myself, and that's probably also why I'm posting this. I think I've played up some of this so that I'm more interesting to a pretty girl I really like. I am interested in the idea of identities and changing myself, like when I was a kid I'd dye my hair a lot, so I think I'm just playing with this idea now because it's interesting in the abstract. I'm pretty sure I'm cis and talking about this is just a fun game to play, and then I think about how I felt when she said the other name. I felt giddy and tingly. I'm feeling panicky about posting this question and I don't know why I'd feel panicky if I weren't afraid to learn something I don't want to know, but I'm still pretty sure I'm cis.

&amp;#x200B;

It also doesn't matter. I'm not male and, even if I were, I'm married to a cishet man with whom I have a life. I love him more than anything and I can't believe how crazy I've gone for this woman, but I have. I can't believe I'm posting this question, but I'm scared and confused and I have no one else to ask. I also miss my friend as a friend and I feel lonely not talking to her even if it's the right thing. I'm terrified to post this because I'm afraid of how people will respond and that it might confirm something I don't want to be true. I also honestly, truly don't think it's true, but then I wonder why I can't breathe properly. I would really appreciate any feedback people have.

This is my first post to reddit. I joined earlier today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a bisexual cis? woman? and I'm feeling extremely confused and hoping members of this community might be willing to help. I recently became good friends with a trans woman and then developed some extremely, inappropriately intense feelings for her (especially inappropriate because I am married to a man I love). I've had crushes before but this is the first time I believe I would have actually gone through with anything physical if she'd felt about me the way I feel about her. It was unbelievably intense, she pushed back, we talked about it, I also really really like her as a friend and a person so we kept hanging out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on some conversations, primarily although at the time unconsciously initiated by me, I think it's possible that the reason my feelings were so intense was because it felt like we had a lot of shared experiences in terms of how we felt about ourselves and our bodies. My feelings mellowed a bit and lost the crazy intensity but I was still pretty into her. I also was daydreaming at some point and picked a name that would be my boy name although obviously I'm not a boy, but I told her and she started using that name and it felt AMAZING. Hearing (seeing in texts) myself referred to by that name gave me intense feelings, literally physical sensations. We also went shopping and I put on a men's shirt and tie and wow it felt really good. We hung out with some friends, I got drunk and I'm not exactly sure what happened but I think she saw me looking at her and figured out that I still have pretty strong feelings so we're going to take a few weeks apart so I can sort myself out, which is definitely the right choice and honestly I'm ashamed this is a boundary she has to set.

2019-04-25 04:32:42,bh4hv8,2,1,"Long post, tl;dr at bottom

MTF, I've been living with my parents since graduation (2015). Currently I'm almost 7 months into HRT. I would have preferred that I started when I moved out, but depression and a series of low-paying jobs never got me the job that would get me there, despite AS and BA degrees, so I didn't want to delay myself any longer. I've had a suspicion that my mother somehow knew that I was trans a while ago, but she never questioned me on anything.

Last Friday I wore a women's blazer that I thought was gender-neutral enough for me to wear without question (black, light-weight, nothing fancy), and because I thought I looked good for the first time in a long time. However my mother noticed right away before I left early to help with Good Friday service. When my mother came in, it was clear that she had been crying; wiping eyes, father's hand on her back. She sat on the opposite side of the church, not next to me, who was visibly sitting by the doors.

She didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and following morning. Later she told me that if I wore a women's blazer to a job interview (like I had mentioned earlier) I wasn't really serious about getting a job. I reluctantly went to my next interview in a men's blazer, but our relationship hasn't been the same. Her adamant disapproval at wearing a blazer, and not being able to even sit next to me caused me to distance myself from her, and she's been stand-offish at times.

I understand that as a parent she's worried for my well-being, and her crying could be from the fact that she now *definitely* suspects I'm trans. I never wanted to tell them until I was off on my own so they wouldn't worry, and it might feel weird in general. However it feels like we both know the truth, and neither of us want to say it for various reasons. She asks if there's anything I want to tell her, and that she worries about me. I've already came out to my brother in fear that they'll tell him first, but should I just come out to them?

She sat on the opposite side of the church, not next to me, who was visibly sitting by the doors.\n\nShe didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and following morning. Later she told me that if I wore a women's blazer to a job interview (like I had mentioned earlier) I wasn't really serious about getting a job. I reluctantly went to my next interview in a men's blazer, but our relationship hasn't been the same. Her adamant disapproval at wearing a blazer, and not being able to even sit next to me caused me to distance myself from her, and she's been stand-offish at times.\n\nI understand that as a parent she's worried for my well-being, and her crying could be from the fact that she now *definitely* suspects I'm trans. I never wanted to tell them until I was off on my own so they wouldn't worry, and it might feel weird in general. However it feels like we both know the truth, and neither of us want to say it for various reasons. She asks if there's anything I want to tell her, and that she worries about me. I've already came out to my brother in fear that they'll tell him first, but should I just come out to them?\n\ntl;dr- 7 months into HRT, living with parents, mother suspects I'm trans, but no one is talking about it.

2019-04-25 13:08:08,bh8f9q,9,37,"I went from cracked a few weeks ago, to getting an appointment with a therapist(not a gender therapist just a normal one. In my country I need a referral from my GP to go to a clinic), where I had only a single goal: to tell another living person that I was transgender. I felt nervous as hell, as I've always been deeply shameful and secretive about that part of myself, and whenever I could gather my thoughts long enough, I'd rehearse the conversation over and over. I explained how I could basically trace every mental block, obsessive behavior, lack of fulfillment, and so on, back to this issue. How it makes so much sense when viewed with being transgender in mind, when before nothing made any sense whatsoever.

She was very understanding of my position, obviously, and I was very pleased she didn't try to force some theory or another on to me, or worse, be dismissive of it. Even if she didn't necessarily have any specialized knowledge, she really helped me see how my inner critic - the one who makes sure i conform to others' expectations and don't step out of line - works, and how that too, is not something I should try to get rid of, but instead embrace it as a part of myself without letting it keep me from realizing myself. It's an inner voice that's only been trying to keep me safe from rejection from others, and that included making sure this part of me never saw the light of day. These 2 opposing sides within me, have been in a constant struggle for 15 years, constantly building on one side only to be matched on the other, until I myself was completely drained from energy. This concept basically convinced me once and for all that I have to seek to embrace every part of myself and gather the fragments to make a whole person, regardless of how this inner voice thinks others are gonna react to it. All in all I was very surprised by how far we got in just 50 minutes.

This was the biggest single step I've taken in all of my 28 years of living regarding this. Next step is my appointment with my GP for a referral to a gender clinic in 2 weeks time for further psychological assessment and possibly HRT if I pass their criteria.

Thanks for reading, and to all of you for your stories I finally built enough courage to go through with this. I hope mine can somehow contribute to that even a tiny bit for someone.

To  be clear I'm not confused about my gender or sex. I'm a ""CIS"" Male or  whatever. I was born with a penis and I'm happy with it.

I'm a little confused about my sexuality and what is currently considered conventionally acceptable.

I'm  writing this as I think it out so I'll do this in parts. I might throw  the terms feminine or masculine around please don't crucify me, I'm  fairly new to the community and its absolutely not my goal to step on  toes.

A: Some context: I'm a 20 year old, bisexual college student, it's the annoying part of finals week  where i have enough free time to kill time but not enough to make time  for work. I've had a lot of time to think and browse.

B:  One of my main kinks/fetishes is the whole ""dominating sissies"" deal  (I'm aware that sissy doesn't = trans, be patient with me) and recently  I've been given a few reasons to think a little more about that.

C:  Earlier this week I met somebody on a sissy subreddit who got me  thinking a little more in general about me and who/what I'm attracted  to. (Its possible that she browses this page, if you see this don't freak  out I'm not finna confess my undying love or something)

D:  I realized after some...research... that my domination kink extends  beyond sissies to cis males, females and I assume everything in between.  What's left in the sissy fetish after you strip away the domination  part of it are males/trans who present themselves in a feminine way,  physically and emotionally.

E: So now I  know that I'm particularly attracted to Male genitals on feminine  forms, inhabited by ""feminine"" personalities. This doesn't mean that I'm ONLY attracted to what I described. I think of it like this; I like damn  near every kind of ice-cream but my favorite flavor is strawberry. Given  a choice of ice creams I'd probably choose strawberry. Would I ignore  offered Ice-cream just because it isn't strawberry? Probably not. (As I right this it comes off chill, hopefully its not actually like super f\*cked up and I just couldn't tell\]

So  having got all that out of the way, my question to this community, as a  semi-ignorant individual, is this: Is there anything wrong with being  attracted to what I described and is there anything unsavory about  pursuing individuals that fit that description?

If not what am I even describing?

My name is Kristen. A friend and I are starting a semi-custom bra company. We are called, The Hubbub. Our goal is to treat the body as a whole, but each breast as an individual. The current lingerie market does not account for asymmetry in bras. In fact, the original structure that is still used in bras was designed in the 1930s and 1940s. Also, the market does not cater properly to the average woman let alone, cancer survivors who have lost breast tissue after treatment, those in the LGBTQA+ communities that may have different fitting needs, and those with limited mobility in their arms or hands due to mobility or physical impairments (stemming from congenital disorders, amputations, and arthritis).

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 14, lots of people told me it would get better. My egg had cracked a little less than a year before and I was so miserable. The environment I was in was absolutely horrible- my parents, along with fighting all the time, would rage at my siblings and me, especially my father. He would throw things at us, scream about the smallest things, and make our lives miserable. I couldn't dress or act in the way I wanted and needed to- I couldn't even have LGBT friends without a lot of shit from my parents- and I felt out of control. Due to my dysphoria, mental health problems, issues at school, and family situation, I turned to self-harm (which I had been doing since the age of 12) and starving myself in order to take control of my life and, in the case of my anorexia, try to lose any feminine parts of my body such as curves and breasts. I was *so* miserable. One day, my mom found something with my preferred name on it and freaked out, and so did my father. I'm not going to get into details about that specific night because it's honestly just too painful to think about, but due to their reaction, I attempted suicide and failed. That was the peak of my mental instability, and all throughout it, people kept telling me it'd get better. My friends consoled me with ""just hold out for a while, this will get better."" My trusted family members told me ""you won't have to deal with this forever."" I didn't believe them. When I was going through all that junk, self-inflicted and inflicted upon me by my situation, I physically could not ever see an end to the misery. When I would try my hardest to keep my sobbing at night quiet so as to not anger my parents, I cursed those who told me that my life would ever be better. How could it ever get better? I was stuck. They just didn't understand. Nobody would ever understand. I felt so... alone.

A year passed from my suicide attempt and we didn't discuss my gender. I started to gain some mental stability, and convinced my parents to let me cut my hair a bit shorter. I started to recover from anorexia, and everything was going pretty ok for me. Then my mom found another red flag that I identified as transgender. I decided with my therapist to come out to her officially and it went... horribly. She told me many horrible things, such as my identity making her want to kill herself and that I could have destroyed our family if she wasn't so strong. She told me she'd never love me as much as she loved my siblings. I fell back into depression, hard. I almost turned to starving myself again. People told me, again, that it would get better. I couldn't believe them- it had gotten arguably worse for me. I just held out as long as I could, trying to survive until college when I could be myself.

After a few months, my aunt caught on to what my mother was doing to me. She said she was horrified and disgusted. She intervened and made my mom take me to a gender therapist, and suddenly a light opened up at the end of the tunnel. It's now been about 9 months since that light opened up, and I'm so thankful I survived. My life has changed so much. My parents got their shit together (when it comes to LGBT stuff- they do still fight and yell and all that but I've become desensitized to it) and my mom especially became one of my greatest allies. I was able to cut my hair how I wanted, I'm going on puberty blockers soon, and I exclusively shop in the men's section of stores. I'm slowly coming out to the people in my life and we are working on a social transition. Dysphoria is still hard, and I face a lot of challenges in my daily life, but for the first time in so many years, I can close my eyes and think about a happy future. I can feel safe in my own home, and among my peers. I still have my share of problems, and am far from my ""happiness goal,"" but now I see that when I cursed the people who told me to hold out, that it would get better, I was just blind- by no fault of my own, of course, but I was blind. All I could see was misery because that's what's easiest for us to see. But even though I gave up hope for my life to ever be tolerable, much less happy, it did get better. I am so excited to get out into the world and live. After coming so close so many times to never getting the chance to live to adulthood, I'm going to take full advantage of the life I've been blessed with. 

Not everyone will be as lucky as I am. I know that. But I came from a situation that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy (there were a lot of things I did not get into in this post due to personal reservations), and now I'm on the road to a happy life. I'm so grateful to everyone who's supported me along the way, but especially for the fact that I never succeeded in giving up. Something or someone always forced me back onto my feet. So, if you're in a time in your life when people are telling you incessantly that it will get better, to just hold on, just step back and put some trust in life. I know how hard it is to see over the wall that's keeping you from happiness, but I promise you from the bottom of my heart that something or someone, whether it's yourself or someone in your life, is going to help boost you up. 

It does get better, I promise. I know, because it got better for me in ways that I could never have imagined.

I‚Äôve read about something within the trans community, or at least an outside observation; that in order to be classified as transgender, you have to have existing gender dysphoria before you take HRT. 

How I understand ‚Äògender dysphoria‚Äô(keep in mind that I am using information provided by this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/MitqjSYtwrQ ): When humans develop in their mother‚Äôs womb, around 7 weeks your gonads develop based on the existing X or Y chromosomes that is combined from the fertilization of the female ova (X chromosome) and the male sperm (X or Y chromosome). But sexual differentiation occurs differently for the brain than the gonads, as when the nervous system is being built sex-specific hormones and chemicals in the womb can affect the development of the brain, gynogens and androgens specifically (progrsterone, estrogen, testosterone, etc.). In the video they further explain how the developing human brain &amp; nervous system, when exposed to these hormones, result in physically different brain sizes and surface areas (as to reference cisgender brain scans). For the case of transgenderism, the hormones that your body‚Äôs gonads produce‚Äîwhen exposed to the brain through chemical distributions and neurotransmissions, if the hormones are not compatible with the brain‚Äôs receptors then it results in the person suffering from ‚Äògender dysphoria‚Äô.

I will try to explain using a chart:

XY body + XX brain = Transgender female
XX body + XY brain = Transgender male

XX body + XX brain = Cisgender female
XY body + XY brain = Cisgender male

I know that I have not used every detail shown in the video, and that the subjects of non-binary and intersex were not explored in the video. 

I do not expect anybody in this community to agree with my findings, as an outsider looking in; I cannot help but see that people use philosophical discourse instead of biology to better understand how and what being transgender is‚Äîthrough scientific research and understanding. Of course, I understand that science does not excuse any sexual and gender minority from social blights, but at least it helps people understand how it occurs in nature.",trans,Controversial finding (dated?),1556418466.0,"{'created_utc': 1556393266, 'id': 'bi2mjn', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'I‚Äôm probably gonna get shat on. \n\nI‚Äôve read about something within the trans community, or at least an outside observation; that in order to be classified as transgender, you have to have existing gender dysphoria before you take HRT. \n\nHow I understand ‚Äògender dysphoria‚Äô(keep in mind that I am using information provided by this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/MitqjSYtwrQ ): When humans develop in their mother‚Äôs womb, around 7 weeks your gonads develop based on the existing X or Y chromosomes that is combined from the fertilization of the female ova (X chromosome) and the male sperm (X or Y chromosome).

Been reading recently about the genetic influence on gender dysphoria. I've come across multiple articles and studies (such as the one linked below).


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22146048


Most of these studies find in pairs of identical twins where at least one twin is transgender, only about 30% if the time, both twins are transgender.


Given that identical twins are born with the same DNA, does this prove that gender dysphoria is mainly caused by environmental factors? Or do you still believe it's a biological condition?


If there was a cure for gender dysphoria (outside of transitioning) would you accept it?


I don't mean to offend anyone or anything, I'm just interested in your opinions on the topic, so I apologise if I come off as harsh, transphobic or whatever.

\- i have physical dysphoria around my voice and height over everything else, but also wish i had a flatter chest, even though i'm already very small chested (i'm getting a binder soon)

2019-04-28 23:31:18,bihj0z,22,0,"So my best friend in the world is a concert pianist and is playing for a benefit of the transgender community. My views having radically changed over the past few years to the point where I was probably transphobic in retrospect. But I want to learn.

So what changed my view to this poiny is a job I had I developed a friendship with a coworker. She's really pretty and often got hit on a lot. Over time, because of discussions I had, I began to realize she may be trans. And over time, my friendship with her began to be more accepting of the realities of what it truly means up be a trans man or woman. While I never confirmed whether or not that was the case, it doesn't truly matter because it affected my views all the same.

Now, I still have some views that clash with the trans community and I really want to begin asking direct questions to further my understanding. These views may be transphobic so I don't want to hurt anybody by bringing up the painful views but I hope you understand that I genuinely want to, again, understand.

Bare in mind I firmly believe in everybody being happy. And what it means to be trans does not affect me personally so I hold no reservations of changing my mind.

Where I am now: If you are a trans woman, you are a woman. Same with being a trans man. I do not even begin to deny this as your identity is your identity and that's all the proof I need. However, if you were born with the xx or xy chromosome, does that not mean that biologically you will not always a retain a part of you that was born into the sex you do not identify with?

Next, I don't understand how it is not a mental illness. I do not mean this derogatorily. The vtopic I am most passionate about in the world is avocating for mental illness and what ever you are diagnosed with does not mean you are lesser in any way. I, myself, am bipolar. It is a constant struggle and, personally, I currently find the notion that something as life and identity changing as wanting to physically transition your biology to reflect your true gender identity impossible to not consider an abnormal mental condition, not that I find anything wrong with that. At all.

Next when it comes to competitive sports. When trans women competes in, say track, isn't it truly unfair to biologically ciswomen and trans women usually blow them out of the water? I find that wrong in a competitive level. Can somebody explain if they find that opinion wrong?

Next when it comes to my personal sexual preferences. If somebody was to ask me if I would ever consider dating a trans woman I would say no. I'm just not attracted to a non cis woman even if they are beautiful. Same goes for that I would not date a short woman as I am extremely tall. Same goes for other physical attributes. So I'm not singling out trans women.

I hope I did not offend anybody to the point where they find me unreasonable. I do want to better understand the transcommunity, especially before going to this benefit so I have a better understanding if it comes to the point where I am asked my views there. I don't like anybody feeling hurt or ashamed.

That's all I have to ask for now. Thank you in advance for partaking in this discussion with me.",trans,"Going to a trans benifit but I have.

Tl;dr Boyfriend came out and is getting loads of abuse and I would like help thinking of ways to cheer him up.

So my now boyfriend (17) came out to me (17) as trans a week or two ago and has been really happy with it so far, his family have been really accepting n stuff as have his online friends.
Yesterday was his first day back at school after easter and he felt awful. 
He tried to come out to his friends and they just either blanked him or ignored him for most of if not all of the day. 
Today has sadly only gotten worse and I'm currently trying to comfort him as he is sat on the floor of one of the bathrooms crying as some of the people he told have given him so much shit for it. With several people still deliberately and actively calling him her and one apparently saying that because he was non-binary before and still kinda wants kids that he isn't trans.

This is honestly awful to hear and I'm trying my best to be supportive but we go to seperate schools and theres only so much you can do when you aren't there to actively try to stop it.

First time here, very long post, sorry ...

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know if I should really post there, still haven't figure it out if I am agender or a trans Afab. Just wanted to share this with you. 

I am shit scared to be honest. Cutting the crap after realising I  was never going to ""succeed"" in being a girl was a huge step but telling myself I might actually be a boy is very frightening. See, I always knew deep inside I wasn't feeling like my body, and I hated it. Once I just put some of my brothers clothes for couple of hours and I took the train with them. It felt weird because it didn't feel weird. I looked like a boy, people didn't look at me like I was some  kind of freak. Having monstrous boobs ( bra cup F, seriously) for a tiny and skinny body I often told myself I couldn't be a boy, because my feminity is so visible people won't  see anything else. But that afternoon proved me wrong, I managed to hide my breasts and I could totally make people see me as a boy if I wanted too

It was 4 years ago and I freaked out.  So I told myself, from now on I would only wear ""feminine"" clothing, wear dresses, make up, high heels... I hoped somehow it would make things easier and ""save "" me from even more problems as I was already coming out as a lesbian and my mom being homophibic it  wasn't easy. 

So for a  years I was in total denial, wearing dresses to prove myself I was a girl, like a gay dude having sex with  so many girls to"" prove himself"" is straight.

&amp;#x200B;

But today I realised, being trans has absolutely nothing to do with clothing or my physical appareance. I don't know why I don't feel like a girl, I mean I have a ""girly"" personality if you stick to stereotypes. I don't know why I don't feel like a girl, I just know I don't. And I am tired to find myself excuses for not being who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I always loved the name Raphael. Never considered changing name before,  not planing on doing it yet. But whenever I feel down I tell myself ""Come on Raph, you can do this"". And it feels great, in fact it gives me a lot of strenght.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to take things very slow because I don't want to pressure myself at being the perfect man like I did at being the perfect girl. And I  still don't know if I am trans. Raphael is just a pretty name, a far away dream, not an identity yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, I just realised how toxic my narcissistic parents are, and that they never allowed to be myself making me believe I was crazy, evil. If I was lesbian and not ""feminine enough"" it was because I was sick, traumatized by a very violent sexual assault that happened to me when I was a child.

But I have read a lot on the subject and I know gender identity and sexual orientation have nothing to do with trauma. I am the way I am, it wasn't my choice and there is no changing or ""fixing"" me.

&amp;#x200B;

All I want to do is learning how to be myself no matter how scary and out of my comfort zone it might be. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, yeah, I am Raphael.
