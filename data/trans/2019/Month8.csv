2019-08-01 10:34:16,ckmmh2,1,1,"Hey, I know that Reddit is not the place for this kind of thing, but I'm still waiting on my therapist responding to my assessment and I need answers, maybe y'all can help.

I've been on hormones for a year and happily (as much as one can be in this transphobic af culture)  identify as a trans woman, but I'm having this crisis of identity.

I feel like I just ""decided"" to be trans. Like for sure there was prescedent- I identified as non binary for years since late high school, shaved my legs, always have been uncomfortable being topless and disliked changing rooms etc... But until quite recently there wasn't really an idea of being female associated with any of that. I disliked my body and had issues but I never thought of myself as at all female. I feel almost like it's some fantasy I've picked up as an idea and put onto myself for various psychological reasons, because there's like... It feels like I wasn't trans before, and then I decided to be trans. I hate this feeling, I feel so insecure in myself but I just don't know how to connect my past and who I was and how I understood myself with my present and future and how I see myself now, and that conflict is messing me up.

I've been understanding this as being because it was made unthinkable for me growing up- like trans people were objectified and vilified, I heard about ""the guy who had a sex change"" in high school, I certainly wasn't going to associate myself with anyone spoken of like that. But why didn't I?

One thing that makes me really uncomfortable is this idea that I'm transitioning to make myself attractive. Like I remember wishing to have been born female as a teenager in a sexual context, and that has been one of the most consistent places for that. I kind of rationalise that as being one of the main places where biological sex is visible and matters, but could it just be a sort of fetish thing? Do I just have a sexualised view of female bodies and femininity, and I'm just transitioning to allow myself to think of myself as a sexual/sensual being?

This all got stirred up by the fact that I am male in my dreams. This always makes me uncomfortable when I wake up because it feels like my subconscious isn't catching up to the fact that I'm trans, and is just sticking to what it was taught. The thing is though, it's been a year of hormones, and even longer since I came out, so why is my mind making me male? Who I was in the dream, like how I acted and the role I took, was very me, but my body and gender were an adult man- something I don't and haven't thought I've identified with.

It's so hard to think about though. I feel like I don't want to be a man, but I can't get a clear understanding of that. I keep asking myself ""why do you feel that? What's underneath that?"" And all I can offer are random, almost academic in their detachment, guesses. I just want an answer that *feels right*. But male, female, non-binary, agender, nothing has the emotional certainty that I'm craving. I feel lost and confused.

It's probably made more difficult by the fact that I *really* don't want to de-transition. Even that word makes me uncomfortable, and I'm not totally sure why. It feels invalidating. I like looking feminine, but I'm not sure if that's something deep-rooted or just a way to escape my body confidence issues. 

I think part of it might be that I don't feel that I really can successfully transition because of my jawline, shoulders, and other masculine features. I know that that's silly and I shouldn't, but knowing that doesn't stop me feeling invalid, and no amount of people hollowly insisting that I'm valid and a woman takes away the image of myself I see in their expression.

Like for sure there was prescedent- I identified as non binary for years since late high school, shaved my legs, always have been uncomfortable being topless and disliked changing rooms etc... But until quite recently there wasn\'t really an idea of being female associated with any of that. I disliked my body and had issues but I never thought of myself as at all female. I feel almost like it\'s some fantasy I\'ve picked up as an idea and put onto myself for various psychological reasons, because there\'s like... It feels like I wasn\'t trans before, and then I decided to be trans. I hate this feeling, I feel so insecure in myself but I just don\'t know how to connect my past and who I was and how I understood myself with my present and future and how I see myself now, and that conflict is messing me up.\n\nI\'ve been understanding this as being because it was made unthinkable for me growing up- like trans people were objectified and vilified, I heard about ""the guy who had a sex change"" in high school, I certainly wasn\'t going to associate myself with anyone spoken of like that. But why didn\'t I?\n\nOne thing that makes me really uncomfortable is this idea that I\'m transitioning to make myself attractive. Like I remember wishing to have been born female as a teenager in a sexual context, and that has been one of the most consistent places for that. I kind of rationalise that as being one of the main places where biological sex is visible and matters, but could it just be a sort of fetish thing? Do I just have a sexualised view of female bodies and femininity, and I\'m just transitioning to allow myself to think of myself as a sexual/sensual being?\n\nThis all got stirred up by the fact that I am male in my dreams. This always makes me uncomfortable when I wake up because it feels like my subconscious isn\'t catching up to the fact that I\'m trans, and is just sticking to what it was taught. The thing is though, it\'s been a year of hormones, and even longer since I came out, so why is my mind making me male? Who I was in the dream, like how I acted and the role I took, was very me, but my body and gender were an adult man- something I don\'t and haven\'t thought I\'ve identified with.\n\nIt\'s so hard to think about though. I feel like I don\'t want to be a man, but I can\'t get a clear understanding of that. I keep asking myself ""why do you feel that? What\'s underneath that?"" And all I can offer are random, almost academic in their detachment, guesses. I just want an answer that *feels right*. But male, female, non-binary, agender, nothing has the emotional certainty that I\'m craving. I feel lost and confused.\n\nIt\'s probably made more difficult by the fact that I *really* don\'t want to de-transition. Even that word makes me uncomfortable, and I\'m not totally sure why. It feels invalidating. I like looking feminine, but I\'m not sure if that\'s something deep-rooted or just a way to escape my body confidence issues. \n\nI think part of it might be that I don\'t feel that I really can successfully transition because of my jawline, shoulders, and other masculine features. I know that that\'s silly and I shouldn\'t, but knowing that doesn\'t stop me feeling invalid, and no amount of people hollowly insisting that I\'m valid and a woman takes away the image of myself I see in their expression. That sounds like regular dysphoria, which makes me feel validated in my identity, but that loops me back to the issue of feeling like is manufactured and reactive to the idea.\n\nI don\'t know what to do and I can\'t make any sense of myself.

2019-08-01 23:02:28,ckvs7o,6,3,"Hi.

I am Trans. I have known I was in the wrong body from when I first understood gender. Growing up in the late 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs I did not even know there were others like me until I saw a documentary on someone transitioning then it all made sense.
I never decided to transition probably mostly due to my extreme social anxiety and the fear how those around me would react.
Then recently I found out about gender fluid people who labled as trans also.
This confused me as to me Trans is very clearly knowing you are in the wrong gender body.
You feel ignorant on this. I know someone who I have known a long time come out as trans particularly gender fluid. But they have shown no sign. We have tabletop role played for a long time and I always played female characters they never have and always played male. So there were no signs.

Several months ago my dysphoria started getting really bad. My girlfriend was very supportive and encouraging at first. We began experimenting with it some and soon it turned into a lesbian relationship. We began going out in public more with me in girl mode. 

Eventually it began to fall apart. The dynamic of the relationship changed. She fell in love with a man who she did not love as a woman. There was not enough support for her, and what she could get often stoked her fears and insecurities. Eventually it kind of turned out that she was a bit of a TERF. That was really difficult.

I've begun coming out slowly to other people. Parents, friends, coworkers, boss.... surprisingly I have received nothing but love and support. Especially strange being in the belt buckle of the bible belt. Everyone has been very accepting, although very inquisitory. So much so that it's almost unnerving. Like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

So now I'm in this weird fucked situation because of being kicked out by my girlfriend where I'm staying in a pretty unhealthy living situation temporarily until I find a place to rent. I have started going to some support groups, but i have not yet gone to see a counselor or begin HRT. 

Last night i went for a walk around the park. It was nice, and i needed to occupy my mind. At the end of the loop, some bros rolled into the parking lot in their dodge charger and I heard the passenger say ""OH MY GOD IS THAT A MAN?!?!?!?"" It was pretty difficult. It made me just feel like a dude in a dress.

She still lives at home with my mom (she‚Äôs still entirely dependent as she has been slow to learn how to function as an independent adult given her difficulties as an autistic individual) and therefor is surrounded by being referred to incorrectly. I do not visit the family home often so I am not aware of the dynamics, but I am on vacation together with my trans sister and my mom, and am shocked that my mom is still blatantly not accepting my sister in that way. My mom is very sensitive to our emotions so this is incredibly surprising to me, especially given she is a counselor. I am going to talk to her the next time we are not around my sister and grill her about how awful that must be for my sister.

My dysphoria is pretty questionable. My childhood memories are very vague, but I know I do remember having ""little inklings"" as a kid. I had some moments of dysphoria, but I tolerated it, and I could live as a girl to an extent. I attempted to mimic many things my dad did and I was always questioning other people's identities at a young age.  Soically, I hung out with boys and girls and was happy, I was pushed away from hanging out with boys and was told only girls would be appropriate. It felt wrong though. Around only girls I was taunted and teased. I never shared a lot of their interests, and it wasn't fun without a balance of boys and girls around. I ended up being left out of everything.  I am mildly autistic as well, so maybe it contributed.

Fast forward to middle school. My discomfort and misplacement took off like wildfire. I felt like the things that were happening to me were all wrong, and it wasn't me. I remember when my ""friend"" convinced my mom to get me my first bra I had a meltdown, and I felt panicked. That whole day I locked myself up in my room and sulked. Same thing with the later things that came with my body. In locker rooms I always (and still do) hide and change in a stall. I didn't want girls to see my body was like theirs, and (not to sound creepy) but being faced in front of other female bodies in that way made me depressed and reminded me that it was my fate to be like that. At this point, I talked to boys every now and then and still eventually got pushed away. As a result, I tried repressing everything to become as feminine as possible. I had mostly female friends, and I adapted well. I really only enjoyed spending time with one of them though, who had nerdy interests like me. I was happy around her, but I was still upset with myself. I wasn't living my life like how I wanted it to be. It made me upset that I couldn't chase after a lot of the things I liked, and that I couldn't be me. 

In about 9th grade, I slowly rebelled against this and dressed more masculine, and opened up my personality a bit more. I was at an all girl's school so all my friends were female. I felt great, and refreshed in masculine attire, I felt like me. However, I also got scared. I felt trapped in a social world that I couldn't always relate to, because of both dysphoria and autism in my opinion. I couldn't stand that females were the only people I could ever talk to (not in a misogynistic way) and I got upset. I purposely alienated myself, I stopped talking to them and I gave up. 

In 10th grade, I transferred. I now have a mixture of boys and girls as my friends. I'm slowly growing into myself (dressing in men's attire, acting in a masculine way non purposefully, etc) and it feels wonderful. I feel like I can finally be free, it feels like I've been suffocating for years and I can breathe now. I'm starting to ease in and talk to more men again as well, and I feel a lot happier doing that. Women are great friends as well, I just haven't felt allowed to talk to other dudes for ages. I talked to older relatives about it, and they told me to wait, I'm too young to know if I'm trans, and it's probably just autism and depression, not dysphoria, so I have my head in my ass. My therapist told me that I have gender dysphoria and should get immediate help, however. I'm really confused. I want to know myself if I'm just a freak or if these feelings I have are genuine.

2019-08-03 19:33:05,clmsix,1,2,"Hi, this is kind of a long story and I want to apologise for being in a throwaway because I am not ready to be open to everyone. Only 19 persons know it from my surroundings and I want to throw everything out for once.

NSS-TL:DR
Came out trans lesbian and my friends are so supportive that I am too emotional from times to times and can't wait to tell more and more people from every good words I receive from everybody since I stepped big on my life this summer.

I will start from where I got the kick in the butt to awake me that I couldn't lie to myself anymore.

It was at the BBQ of my workplace when one of my coworker brought her daughter and start saying:
*""She only goes along with girls even if there are more men and if there is none, she will be asociale""*

But from afar, with my 10yo dreads, I was tickling her and we were laughing because I am good with kids and during the evening she asks for being sat beside me on a 2 feet tall wall of brick and start tickling me with an herb.

Her dad shouts ""You are the only guy I ever saw my girl having fun with."" Then to her to answer ""I tickle you because I love you.""

My bong rip before shower achieved in my brain every connection in the world from all the calls I ever wanted to flee.

The fact I never really loved my body and felt like my ineffective weapon of self suffering was too much... Could go deep on this one and I am not ready for that personal detail yet.

My mono-breast that developed and the fact I regret having it removed due to mom's pressure. I personally think it is too late for me to do the transition because of that. As I ""banned"" my own nature as I could have had at least one real breast... Then it would be like to ask for a rewind... And I am worried about my future spawn as I won't be able to give birth.

The reason I shaved myself at 8 but got surprised by my dad.

My youth's taste, activities and affinities.

I don't want to be attention whoreing and having you believe I'm crazy so I will end here. 

Thanks for your time!
Be a better version of yourself, every tomorrow.

2019-08-03 21:30:22,clo4nl,1,2,"I really don't know if this is the right place to ask for help on this and if not I'm really sorry I'll go somewhere more appropriate. I also want to apologise in advance if anything I say sounds insensitive, I'm not very good with language and though I'm trans and gay, I'm not very involved in the community and don't always have the right terminology. I mean no offence so please correct me if I say something wrong. 

I just came out to my Mother. It was completely unplanned. I never planned on coming out to my family. I've been struggling lately with dysphoria and depression and she asked me what's been bothering me so much. I told her I couldn't talk about it but that I'd be okay and she shouldn't worry. She said she just wanted to help with whatever was bothering me. I said I knew that and appreciated that but I couldn't discuss it. She asked why. 

To explain my answer, first I should say that I have never planned on coming out to my family. Ever. They're very traditional and we come from a very traditional community. I would not be accepted or safe if I came out in this community, with the exception of my Mother who is upset but understanding. I plan on relocating to another country in the future and transitioning there. As for returning to visit my family I figured that I'd cross that bridge when I came to it or try to disguise my transition as much as possible when visiting. At least I'd be self sufficient and have a home in another country to return to if things went wrong. I thought I could disguise it as I've always been quite androgynous. I've always been fairly flat chested so I doubted they'd notice top surgery (ftm). I'd never have reason to show them bottom surgery. As for hormonal changes... well. Harder to hide but maybe a close shave? None of the born male relatives in my family have a lot of facial hair so maybe I won't either? I've been deepening my voice through vocal training for years so maybe the hormonal changes wouldn't alert them? The point is, for years, I've been thinking about how to hide my transition from my family and hometown friends when I get to go through with it. 

Anyway, back to my accidental coming out. When she asked why I couldn't talk about what was bothering me, I said that I had a secret that was a fundamental part of myself that I could never change and I was upset about it. She asked me to explain. I said that it was a secret I'd been keeping and it was a secret about myself that can't ever be changed but it will never hurt or affect her so she shouldn't worry. I said it was nothing for her to worry about because I've made peace with myself and how my life is going to be. 

She said it sounded like it was something awful and she was worried. So she started listing different things, starting with are you a serial killer? which was admittedly pretty funny, until about twenty minutes later she got to the truth. I didn't want to confirm but it was fairly obvious by the expression on my face and she got a little upset. She started to cry and asked me not to tell my Father because she was scared about how he'd handle it. I agreed- I know my Father would disown me and that really is a best case scenario. 

She told me that she loved me but she was so worried for me. I told her I was never going to do anything about it- she told me that she didn't want me to be unhappy. She asked if I had spoken to a professional. I said no, because I'm not going to medically transition. She asked if I'd be happy to live my life that way, without changing my body. I said I wasn't sure. She said that I'm a girl repeatedly. I said that I wasn't. She said that physically, I am. I said yes, I can't deny that. She assured me that she loved me no matter what but admitted that this wasn't what she'd want for her child and she didn't know enough about it to help me. I told her I understood that and I was sorry if this was a disappointment. She said that I wasn't a disappointed as a person but she wished that this wasn't the case for me as she sees this as an obstacle in life and she feels that I won't live a normal life. I said yes, I understood that. She said she was worried about what this would mean for the rest of my life. I said I was too. 

We discussed it for a while longer and she expressed once again that my Father and some siblings wouldn't be accepting and wouldn't allow this. She also asked if I'd ever get married. I've always doubted I'll ever find a relationship if I transition, so I didn't know how to answer the question. I know there are countless other trans people in relationships but I'm not sure I ever will be, so I didn't know how to answer. I just told her I don't know. She was quite upset by that. She said she just wanted me to be happy in life, that she'd always love me, but she was terrified for me. She also asked me not to end my life. I have no intentions to. She said that she doesn't know much about what it means to be transgender- she didn't use that word she has very basic language when it comes to this- but she did know that lots of people in this situation end their lives. I said that some do. I didn't want to explain that that tends to be in cases where people repress their situation, etc. I didn't want her to worry because at the moment I am repressing my identity.

Now, I feel guilty. I don't know why I feel guilty, I know I've done nothing wrong, but I'm so sorry to have hurt my Mother. I know this isn't what she wanted for me and I hate making her cry. I know I have her unconditional love and she's reminded me that I do no matter what. I'm grateful for that and I've always known my Mother loves me deeply even if she doesn't understand me. I'm so lucky for that. But she's also told me that she knows the rest of our family won't accept me and she's confirmed that I shouldn't transition here if I ever do. I went through a lot as a child and teenager and put a lot of stress on her so now I just feel incredibly guilty for putting more stress on her. I didn't want this to become her problem, I wanted to deal with this alone. I wanted to make her proud of me in life and I want her to enjoy her life without worrying for me. 

Now, she's upset and it feels awkward between us. She's tried to make conversation and I've tried to return it normally, but there's an obvious tension between us and she's clearly very upset. I don't know what to do from here. Do I just return to normal and act as if I never told her? Do I give her some resources to read? I'm not sure how to make her feel less worried. She is very very sheltered about LGBTQ+ issues and she doesn't understand the community at all. This isn't hatred on her part but she's never had to learn about it. She has no hate in her heart and she's a kind woman, just sheltered. I do feel loved by her but I don't know what to do to make her feel better. She's going away for a work trip soon and she's expressed that she doesn't want to go because she's scared for me. I've told her that nothing has changed, she just knows my secret now, nothing is going to happen to me, I'm fine and safe. She told me that she's always worried about me and she can't help but worry more now. I don't want this to ruin her trip.

I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I feel awful and guilty and sad. I wish I hadn't told her. I wish I'd told her nothing was bothering me. If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it. If not, I just feel better for having shared somewhere.

Though I dislike it, I am not upset at them and understand it is not a right away thing and they are putting forth the effort (and sometimes correct each other).

**Summary of the UK Equality Act: 'sex' and 'gender reassignment'**

Under the UK Equality Act,  sex and gender reassignment are both, and separately, protected. In UK law, ‚Äòsex‚Äô is understood as binary, with a person's legal sex being determined by what is recorded on their birth certificate. A trans person can change their legal sex by obtaining a GRC. A trans person who does not have a GRC retains the sex recorded on their birth certificate for legal purposes.

So this means that there are data points for both 'gender reassignment' and 'sex', by means of a ""legal"" sex and a sex ""assigned at birth"".

**Legal self-ID (not social)**

In social terms, everyone should have the right to self-ID; to not be misgendered nor mistreated in terms of their sex or gender. The UK Equality Act aims to protect this right. 

In legal terms, it seems important to have an objective measure for how we determine 'sex'. In the UK Equality Act, this can be determined by either the assigned sex at birth, or the legal sex. 

In this article, I read a paragraph that stunned me:

""‚Ä¶The prioritisation of self-declared gender identity within policy-making represents a departure from the key principles which have underpinned advances in women's rights, and carries significant implications for how female inequality is addressed. As [**Stock (2019)**](https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/scot.2019.0284#) argues, the dismissal of sex as a relevant policy tool ‚Äòleaves us with no adequate language to describe a politically important feature of material reality‚Äô, undermines our ability to ‚Äòtrack actual facts about sex, as it operates across various social groups, practices and discourses‚Äô, and describe the effects of sexism and misogyny. From a legal and policy perspective, the argument that a transwoman should be treated as a woman sits uneasily with the [**Equality Act 2010**](https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/scot.2019.0284#), as it renders sex irrelevant as a protected characteristic‚Ä¶ while the Act does allow trans people access to single-sex services, this is not unconditional and single-sex services providers may exclude trans people providing certain tests are met.""

In British Columbia, Canada, the requirement for surgery to change the birth certificate gender marker was removed in 2014. The BC Human Rights Tribunal (BCHRT) is currently facing a case that presents a key difficulty: whether the waxing of a woman's base, shaft and scrotum is discrimination for any business that offers ""Brazilian waxes"" to women. This case is difficult to resolve for many reasons. For example, training courses for women's waxing has not historically included the base, shaft and scrotum.

[https://globalnews.ca/news/5698337/bc-human-rights-trans-waxing-case/?fbclid=IwAR1DVKOsX6mnN5KaRsgkVwcTklCu4FNY-skuGv6hPG0Yy\_8mS29FKF8-kFs](https://globalnews.ca/news/5698337/bc-human-rights-trans-waxing-case/?fbclid=IwAR1DVKOsX6mnN5KaRsgkVwcTklCu4FNY-skuGv6hPG0Yy_8mS29FKF8-kFs)

There are other concerns in self-ID that relate to sports, prisons, etc. 

**Transgender is distinct from DSD**

Within this discussion, it seems important to maintain a clear distinction between DSD and trans people because DSD is, by definition, about atypical development of a person‚Äôs body. DSD is defined by the medical community as ‚Äúcongenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal or anatomic sex is atypical.‚Äù

Although it is certainly possible that a child born with DSD will eventually identify as a transgender person, it is also possible for children born without DSD to eventually identify as transgender. Most people with DSD are not transgender, and most transgender people have no identifiable DSD.

**TLDR**

TLDR; I am extremely concerned that a legal self-ID will have a radical and negative impact on the UK Equality Act. I am seeking reassurance and evidence that a perpetrator's legal self-ID would not be **unconditional** in times of significant discrimination, harassment and abuse. I recognize that the significant majority of instances of a legal self-ID would cause no harm.",trans,[UK Equality Act] Would a legal self-ID render sex irrelevant as a protected characteristic?,1564960330.0,"{'created_utc': 1564935130, 'id': 'cly1os', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'This is a genuine question, and does not intend to cause distress.

How do you be sure? I'm not sure if I want to be mtf or not. Here's some things I feel/notice:

First of all - nearly 16 (16 in March)

Don't mind being a boy, but I *think* I might like being a girl more? Not sure if that's dysphoria or what.

Have longer hair, just made it cover less of my face and looks slightly more feminine?

I enjoy using more feminine Snapchat filters, but I'm too embarrased to show it to anyone else.

Feel like I'd enjoy having female parts more?

Haven't tried dressing up or anything, too embarrased and don't know how I'd try without people knowing as I souldn't be able to buy clothes or anything without my mum knowing

Recently (for a few days) feel I want to try to be more feminine, but I'm embarrased and don't know what people would think of me (hence the not sharing snapchat filter pics)

I think I wan't to be more feminine/""cute"", but don't wsnt people to judge me. (Feel like I can't express my more feminine side? Dunno.)

So overall I don't know if I really want to be trans or not. I don't want to ztart some sort of treatment or surgery, then to realize it was a phase or something. I feel I'd wsnt to be more feminine but I don't know how others would react. 

Are there questions I can ask myself? Ways I can try things without people knowing? (At least at first) Also, what methods of becoming trans are there. (Like surgeries, hormones, etc)

And those ‚ÄúWould you press the button to get money, but also you‚Äôd have to change genders‚Äù were always a super easy answer for me. ‚ÄúHell yeah, why wouldn‚Äôt I?‚Äù

I‚Äôve had this feeling of wanting to be a cute girl for as long as I can remember. I never spoke to anyone about it, but I always thought, ‚ÄúMe, a cis male, is thinking these things, therefore it must be a normal thought that other cis males have.‚Äù 

I recently learned that it definitely not the case. 

I stumbled across r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns and r/egg_irl and I never felt more at home. 

Everyone having the same thoughts as me, I‚Äôve been a ‚Äúcertified egg‚Äù for the longest time, but I was talking to a friend earlier, explaining my feelings and it hit me. 

As I was typing out some thoughts I wrote, ‚ÄúWould I want to be a girl? Yeah! Do I still want to be a boy?‚Äù And at that point, I could answer it. I realized that I didn‚Äôt. I realized that I don‚Äôt like who I am. I felt this massively overwhelming feeling of almost relief. 

I don‚Äôt want to be a male. 

Reflecting on that, and everything else I‚Äôve felt throughout my life made me break down into tears. 

I know what I want, for once in my life. 

I feel almost complete. 

I feel a sense of pride. 

I told my friend what I was going through at that moment. She asked me what my name was going to be, and I wasn‚Äôt sure. My shortened name is unisex, so I said I could just stay with that. That way it‚Äôs less confusing for everyone else. 

She said, ‚ÄúFuck that. Girl, it‚Äôs about you‚Äù

Girl. 

The tears came flooding back

It felt so good to be called that

I felt pure bliss at that moment 

She sent me a picture of some baby shower decorations that said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a girl!‚Äù

I‚Äôve never felt that type of happiness.

This is who I am now, this is me. It‚Äôs so overwhelming. 

But now the hardest part is going to be letting people know. I have massive fears about what other people think of me. My anxiety has been rampant when I told a few of my friends. But they‚Äôve all been supportive and happy for me. 

The issue is my ex-wife. 

I haven‚Äôt told her yet. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to, but we have a kid together, so I‚Äôll be subjected to being around her more often than not. 

As is, when I came out as pansexual, she‚Äôs poked fun at me. It‚Äôs like she won‚Äôt let me be me. I can‚Äôt feel comfortable when I‚Äôm around her. I can‚Äôt be who I want to be, and it‚Äôs killing me. 

That time will come. Eventually. 

As for now, I have my other friends who are here for me, and are going to support me through this whole thing. 

My next move is to find a counselor or therapist that I can talk to. I need professional help with dealing with all of these new emotions, and hopefully I can start a conversation about possible transitioning. 

Im hoping this is the right place to post this, I just really needed to get this off my chest to other people. There‚Äôs only a very small select number of friends I‚Äôve told. I chose them because I knew they‚Äôd be okay with it. It‚Äôs a start. And I‚Äôm so very glad I have them in my life. 

Do anyone have any advice on how to deal with this newfound epiphany? Any tips on how to deal with people? Where to go from here?

TL;DR I was born male, and now I want to be female. Some friends are supportive, but I fear telling others. But regardless, I‚Äôm happy with this new choice of mine.

I don‚Äôt necessarily want to, but we have a kid together, so I‚Äôll be subjected to being around her more often than not. \n\nAs is, when I came out as pansexual, she‚Äôs poked fun at me. It‚Äôs like she won‚Äôt let me be me. I can‚Äôt feel comfortable when I‚Äôm around her. I can‚Äôt be who I want to be, and it‚Äôs killing me. \n\nThat time will come. Eventually. \n\nAs for now, I have my other friends who are here for me, and are going to support me through this whole thing. \n\nMy next move is to find a counselor or therapist that I can talk to. I need professional help with dealing with all of these new emotions, and hopefully I can start a conversation about possible transitioning. \n\nIm hoping this is the right place to post this, I just really needed to get this off my chest to other people. There‚Äôs only a very small select number of friends I‚Äôve told. I chose them because I knew they‚Äôd be okay with it. It‚Äôs a start. And I‚Äôm so very glad I have them in my life. \n\nDo anyone have any advice on how to deal with this newfound epiphany? Any tips on how to deal with people? Where to go from here?\n\nTL;DR I was born male, and now I want to be female. Some friends are supportive, but I fear telling others. But regardless, I‚Äôm happy with this new choice of mine.

When I was younger, it was because of my slightly transphobic family and my religion, but now it's even worse bc I've been volunteering with my religion for the past two years under tight restrictions and constant supervision.  Pretty much everything I do has to happen late at night after my roommate is asleep, and I'm constantly dealing with stress bc if I get found out, pretty much my entire life is screwed over.  Nonetheless, I've been pretty successful thus far.

It still sucks though.  I love the euphoria when I do wear almost all feminine clothing, but the dysphoria of knowing that I've still got to be in boymode even when I do such and that I can never realistically transition has me feeling like I'm just lying to myself.

Tonight has been weird because of it.  I lowkey ordered some more feminine clothing on Amazon and it came in today (along with some other stuff so it wasn't noticed), and the feeling of trying it on was amazing.

However, I think the pair of joggers that I bought to wear as pajama bottoms are a size too big, because they are definitely baggier looking and feeling than what the listing made it look like.  And this isn't really that surprising, since I'm still figuring out sizing on things, but I am still really bumbed about it bc I ordered my jeans size and everything and it's just not what I was hoping it would be.  And I'm too scared to return them and order a smaller size, because then I'd have to bring more attention to them and the smaller size might end up being too small?  idk.

Gosh. It's times like this when I'm emotional mess.  And I make myself miserable.

2019-08-06 05:08:07,cmmbxb,2,0,"hello. 
why do i feel like this?
i fantasize (non-sexually, obviously) about being trans. i know it sounds weird. for more background: i hate my feminine name but i don‚Äôt hate my body, i just like it more when i‚Äôm binding/look masculine. i can appreciate my body objectively, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like me. i like being seen as either a boy or something between a girl and a boy. i feel like my life hasn‚Äôt started yet, and i‚Äôm just waiting. when i think too much about my gender i feel a panic attack coming on and i put it off. i feel a sense of disconnect between my life and my subconscious. often i feel homesick for somewhere i‚Äôve never been. i hate (feminine) women‚Äôs clothes for the most part, i hate being called a girl or pretty, and i hate being seen as/ called a lesbian. 
but anyways, i often fantasize about coming out as a trans man. i think about telling people my new name and pronouns and dealing with people at my school and just existing as a trans man. i obviously want to be seen as a man but i also want to talk about my transition. this sounds weird. i want to wear a trans flag and be proud of who i am. sure i look up to cis men and want to be them and i‚Äôd be much happier if i woke up one day as a teen boy instead of the freak i am now but i fantasize about having a trans experience.

After looking around a bit I figured I had some sort of gender euphoria, which I think explained my situation well. However, I'm not certain I should commit to anything major as of yet (nor come out anytime soon), but I figured a good place to start would be to try cross dressing.

I have a very passable idea for an excuse as to why I would have female clothes (gender-bender themed party at college) in the meantime, which could also be used to diffuse awkward confrontations in stores buying fem related stuff (buying bra related stuff would still probably be lethally awkward). I do not know what to buy or how to determine what kind of makeup to buy or what bra and/or breast substitute to look for.

There is someone at my college who someone recommended to me who could help with at least the makeup, I know she's LGBT+ friendly but I haven't spoken to her much so it could be a tad odd just coming out of nowhere and asking for help.

Another issue is I feel some of my facial features are quite masculine, i.e.: large nose bridge, more angled jaw.

tl;dr: Newbie wants to dip his toes into trans by cross-dressing, needs advice on what/how to buy.

2019-08-06 19:59:05,cmvg2v,3,11,"I've always felt something along the lines of ""if science could give me a prostate, I'd immediately switch"" but dismissed it as a combination of hating how society treats women in general and just deeply wishing I was someone Not Me.  I never gave it too much thought because I'm pretty happy with the life I have (husband, kids, straight privilege) and my husband is extremely straight.  But *now,* everything in my marriage is bashing repeatedly against the rocks, so there's no reason not to chase this idea down further.

I don't hate the femaleness of my body, but the sort of dark pleasure that I've derived from seeing it become less and less ideal due to aging, pregnancy, weight changes, etc has a certain tinge of self-destructiveness?  I do loathe the way women fit into society and at times deeply resent male privilege.  Similarly, I was always baffled why anyone would *want* to be a woman (I've gotten over this bit of bigotry, fortunately) which is another hint that maybe my hangups around gender are more than just frustration with the unfairness of it all.

But on the other hand, I don't want to be male so much as I want to be a teenager of the dude persuasion.  Which, uh, isn't exactly a gender identity as much as it is an escapist fantasy.  My own teen years were filled with a lot of obstacles, restrictions, and difficulties tied directly to being a girl &amp; meanwhile, my curriculum choices sort of automatically filtered me into having mostly male friends.  So there's a long history of being on the outside looking in at all the greener grass. (Lookit, I made the metaphors match!)   My fondness for PG Wodehouse books and boarding school narratives doesn't do much to dispell this perception that being a young man with a bit too much time on his hands with a few too many friends with low impulse control must be the most fun thing in the world.

I dunno.  I really have always felt that if transitioning was as easy as flipping a switch, fuck yeah I'd flip it.  But I don't know if that opinion is due to an active desire to switch genders or if it's due to a sort of background loathing of societal restrictions on women.  And with regard to dysphoria, seeing my body become more womanly over the years has actually been sort of satisfying‚Äîbut it's been a sort of morbid fascination with how much my female body has been distorted and ""ruined"" by living a standard feminine life.  

Is there anyone else who struggled with these sort of ambiguous feelings?  What pushed you into deciding ""yup, I'm trans"" as opposed to writing everything off as hating the patriarchy?  What pushed you into feeling like actually transitioning was worth how much more difficult life would be?

I do loathe the way women fit into society and at times deeply resent male privilege.

I'm a MtF nonbinary person. When I came out to my partner almost three years ago she was very supportive, but we've since had a tough time engaging in important conversations around my gender. I've remained almost entirely closeted at home because of this and lately my dysphoria has gotten worse.

2019-08-07 20:28:52,cnb6li,2,2,"This question is ideally for college age folks or above in the sub who can speak from experience. I teach as an assistant professor at a medium sized regional uni in the South and had a student in an upcoming class email me about using their preferred name and using she/her pronouns, which I've made a note of in my roster, but I had a few questions since I plan on doing additional training as an LGBTQ+ ally on campus and this is my first MtF student.

Are there things professors tacitly or maybe unintentionally do that could be construed as discriminatory or hostile to you?

2019-08-09 02:30:31,cnw0fp,0,1,"I'm not trans\*. I've been in a relationship with a trans\* person for over 8 years. I'm a cis, straight-ish hetero-flexible man.  I'm here because I feel lost.

My partner and I have a healthy open relationship. He's been non-binary (identified as gender-flexible at the time) from day one. The combination this, the fact that he has some Asperger's tendencies (as he'd say), the way he looked, the fact that we met at the  kink scene all hit in the right places. I didn't know how long it's going to last, he sure as hell didn't know it's going to last years (he tried to get rid of me, but as he would say, kept coming back for more... hehe) and well, here we are living together in the same apartment and it works. I'm his first move out of his parents' house, and he got his first real job (able to pay his own rent, which he's very proud about as he should be) in the last couple of months since we started to live together. It's a good relationship, we support each other, we love each other, and the sex is great. 

And that's the big problem. I wish, god I wish sex would NOT be such an issue for me. I hate how low, flat and boring this is. I hate how awful this is. I'd seriously consider an operation to remove my balls if it wasn't a part of me that I like, and sex is just too fucking good. He does not have my sex drive, but we manage. 

So now that you have the information filled in, I think the rest is painfully familiar. I know that I'm not going to be as attracted to him physically as I am now when he transitions. He is the most attractive long-term person I've ever been with, and our chemistry is awesome. The fact that he's going to transform feels like the equivalent of him telling me he has cancer: he has some time left to live, after which he would be gone. He will still be there, yes, but a different person. I want him to do it. I want him to transition because he wants it. It's who it is. I understand \*I\* don't want it, and I know this is \*my\* problem, but that doesn't help jack shit, he's still going to be gone. It doesn't help that he is the only one I'm physical with -- even though  I'm in an open relationship, being close to 40 means it's not easy to find attractive women with the same mindset (please don't tell me to try to date, I've been doing nothing but for the last 2 years, no one worth the time is seeking someone ""taken"" who doesn't want kids). So that's what I meant earlier about cutting my own nuts. I mean what's the point? It gives me nothing but pain, like a drug addict who can't get a fix no matter how hard he tries. And I hate it. 

We talked about this before, to an extent. He knows I'm scared he's going to become ""a big fat bear"" but it's not even that. I'm just afraid of losing someone I love. Someone I can't replace and don't want to replace. I am afraid that I can't be with him if he transitions because I will be a shadow of what I used to be to him. I love him too much and I won't leave, but I will be more of an empty shell, a shoulder to cry on  perhaps, that sort of thing. And autistic tendencies or not, he knows. he will know. And it will hurt him. And I can't bare the thought of hurting him. He's innocent, he's sweet, and all he wants is to become more of who he really is. And I'm the damn asshole in the way because I need sex. 

So I'm sure you've heard this story  or versions of it many times before. I'm sure many of you are on the other side of this fence, you've been pushed out of your families, out of relationship, been casted out and rejected constantly. I don't know how this is like in that regard, but I know enough that I never want to do this to him. But at the same time, I don't know what to do. I'm lost.

I went into his bedroom room to try and retrieve my phone and bag he then tries to hit me the cane multiple times saying I cant have my phone he then grabs my bag throwing it down the stairs, he then grabs my phone and shuvs it in my face trying to hurt me so I slapped across the face out of self defense breaking two of his teeth.
On another occasion we was in his room where he forces me to strip naked after an small argument I do as he makes me we makes me go on his bed where shortly after another argument occurs where he accuses me of cheating for some reason. when the argument begins to die down he grabs me by the neck hard and forces him self onto me and precedes to rape me.

On top of this he¬† would also try to make me change my preferred name to something he picked usually something from an anime like attack on titan. He also associated my preferred name at the Mili with the abbuse towards me causing me to change it to Laura when I started to try and leave. He would also mock me for having at the time sort hair even starting arguments about it if had to get it cut.

He wouldn't let me leave my house to the point I had to sneek out to do basic stuff such as shopping and college. He also said that if we was to get a house he would keep me tied up so I couldn't leave and I could clean and cook and ""he could fuck me when he wants"".

I shut off my phone because I didn‚Äôt want to cause more trouble.

My other friend interjects (let‚Äôs call him J) and said that he should ‚Äústop typing in all caps‚Äù.  Z and J converse for a while, with Z saying that I was ‚Äúbeing ungrateful‚Äù.

She even called me up one day after I ranted about how she doesn\'t accept me, and she said ""I accept you, \\[insert dead name\\], you\'re just not trans"". I know that dysphoria works differently for all trans people. Wearing dresses set off my dysphoria  (is that how I should put it?) but wearing makeup does not.\n\nI\'ve learned to cope with her not accepting me by reaching out to all my friends about my gender and such, and the first person that I came out to actively participates in this thread, so, thank you man!

2019-08-14 19:50:21,cqevbt,7,2,"Hello, I'm Dwyn, and I'm genderqueer/genderfluid. I fluctuate between binary masculine and binary feminine, and agender/neutrois. I don't consider myself non-binary, since my gender experience is on a binary or just a complete ""fuck you"" to gender altogether.

I've been having a lot of dysphoria lately, in an agender phase, and it sucks. It sucks so much. All my clothes suck. Nothing makes me feel okay. Binding is as close as I can get to getting rid of the dysphoria, but it's still painfully obvious that I'm not comfortable. I never know what to wear, and ironically, it's easiest to just lie wrapped in a blanket naked.

I keep trying to remind myself that my body is not my gender, but it's really hard when the world genders me based on my body. I get it, I have a biological sex and that means something, but it's not the same as my gender and right now I'd rather not have any gender at all. My brain is going on about gender being useless and unnecessary, just something to divide us and make us separate, based on reproductive parts and then extended into a bullshit dichotomy that serves as a foundation for so much pain.

I know that surgeries won't help with the dysphoria, and I feel like a bad trans person for that. I can't take hormones either because the dysphoria for one gender will just be replaced when I switch into the other gender (like taking HRT to be more masculine will fuck me up when I feel more femme.) There aren't really any problems I have with my body anyway, on my own. It's when I go out and about and people gender me that the dysphoria hits the hardest so I've been really agoraphobic and not going outside when the agender phase arrives. Maybe if I looked more androgynous, people wouldn't gender me so starkly, but I don't have the means right now to do that and don't know how to achieve that or if I would even be comfortable with an androgynous gender expression.

When I feel like a girl, I feel very much like a girl, and when I feel like a boy, I'm very much a boy. Once I thought I was demi, but it's much more euphoric to really sink into the gender and express it that way. But the agender phase is the worst because I don't know how to express it without going into silly androgynous looks that will still make it hard for me to pass as agender.

I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm transgender (FTM) or not, but here are my reasons.

While I was growing up I was always super feminine and loved pink and girly things, such as hello kitty and Barbie dolls. Now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôm questioning my gender identity.

During the middle years of my life I was a classic masculine girl. Tomboyish. Never had short hair but acted sorta like a guy. I wished I could be a guy.

A month and a half ago I started feeling uncomfortable being called a girl, pretty, beautiful and uncomfortable on how feminine my body and face looks. (Mainly my chest) My desires to be male grew intensely and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs gender dysphoria or it‚Äôs just me being stupid. I looked into it more about when I first started questioning and it sorta made sense.

I‚Äôm having a hard time believing I‚Äôm trans ‚Äî or not trans enough because I was super feminine as a young kid and I don‚Äôt think my parents would believe I‚Äôm trans because of that.

Please excuse me if I say the wrong thing here. I‚Äôm trying to learn as much as I can. 

From the time my son was little I always had the suspicion he would not be heterosexual. As he‚Äôs grown (he‚Äôs almost 10) he‚Äôs given a lot of hints as such - his stuffed animals were boyfriends, he kissed a boy in second grade, etc. Last year he started painting his nails with a lot of frequency (he got nail polish from a friend since I don‚Äôt even have nail polish). My husband and I have never been bothered by this at all because we just want him to love who he is and be happy with himself.   

Last year at school he tried to kill himself. With little knowledge of self harm thankfully he was not even close to danger. 

Since then we have put him in counseling. My son and I have a very close relationship. For some of his sessions he asks me to join him. A few weeks ago he told his therapist he has always felt as though he should have been born a girl and feels more female than male. I‚Äôve never heard him express that before and although I was surprised it didn‚Äôt hurt me at all. 

Ever since then though I‚Äôve been stressed with worry. I‚Äôm worried for what he‚Äôs going to go through at school, with his life, etc. I want to protect him from the hate, the cruelness he may encounter, etc. We have not even told the family of this since some grandparents will not be supportive and they may start treating him differently from our other children. 

How can I/we be supportive of this? 

What kind of things should I be looking out for that there‚Äôs a potential problem with a bully at school? 

What have your experiences been growing up? 

When did you feel different at your birth gender - is it normal to be this young and feel that way? I know anything can happen but will it change back because he‚Äôs so young? 

Sorry for the barage of questions - I just want to be supportive of him (he doesn‚Äôt want me to call him her and likes his name - which ironically is used as both a male and female name). I‚Äôve never had any trans friends - not because I‚Äôm not open but because I can‚Äôt say we have a large population of trans people in our area.

Gender has never really mattered much to me and I've never strongly identified with my assigned gender- this isn't too unusually or so I have been told. In the past, I had wondered if I was perhaps genderfluid, but this was during the- for lack of a better term- the anti-SJW 'shoot down transtrenders' stage of the internet so I never allowed myself to really explore that as a possibility. Mostly out of fear of ridicule.

Now that that has been moved past for the most part. I really do want to have a serious discussion regarding that.

I sometimes find myself just wishing to be different than how I am already physically when it comes to how I present myself to others- but idk if thats just me being insecure and/or dysphoric.

The first post I made on this account was on this sub, and mostly talked about my experience after accepting myself. The truth is I've never done that. I've never gotten to a point where I've been definitely able to say I'm trans. I know that's the case for pretty much everyone. It's never definite. In fact I know it's that very thought that is used against the trans community when trying to get ahold of HRT or reassignment surgery and other helpful medical things. When I say it's not definite I mean that I'll have times where I feel very comfortable accepting that maybe I am trans (MtF btw). Then there's the rest of the time where I reject that idea completely. Like there's no way I am. The thing is even when I'm rejecting the idea I still get bothered by male pronouns being used, or I get nervous when the trans community is brought up in conversation, like I'll out myself or something. One example of the irrational fear of outing myself is at school. There's one fully out trans person in my school (saying ""fully out"" because idk if there are more). They're FtM. Every time I talked to them last year I had this irrational fear that they'd ""figure me out"", and I'd get super nervous around him. Any way I don't want to ramble on about that. It's a hard feeling the describe, but I'm sure plenty of you feel it. The feeling like you are the opposite gender, but then you don't feel like you are, and even when you don't feel it you still do (it's quite confusing I'm sorry). This feeling has stopped me from doing one big thing. If you look through my post history there's a post to r/traa where I say that I was going to come out to my mom. I didn't. I was planning on it, but doubt took over and I deleted the letter. I don't regret it though. My life has gotten so confusing that I don't even feel like I know who I am. I feel like I'm in a rush to figure it out. I'm 16, which is very young I understand that, but I'm dealing with male puberty and have been hating almost all of it. Even though I hate it I still doubt me being trans. I just don't understand anything going on. I feel like I keep asking myself every day why I keep rejecting this part of me. And the answers always that it's just a part of me that I don't fully understand. I don't know how to understand it though. Thus I've entered what I like to call ""My never ending cycle of questioning"" (see title). I call it that because that's what it feels like. Like it will go on until the day I die and torment me until then. I just don't know what to do. Even when I do think of possibly doing something about my whole gender identity crisis (makes it sound way more intense then it probably is honestly) I keep telling myself to out it off. Not only because of the neverending questioning thing, but I'll find other reasons. The main reason I find right now is to wait until after my senior (which I'm entering this year).

2019-08-17 14:43:48,crmz7n,4,3,"I‚Äôm coming out to my cousin and his fianc√© today. 

They are in town this weekend to announce to the whole family about their engagement, but everyone already knows. They are two of the closest people in my life, we were all kinda shy kids growing up.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen, but I‚Äôm at peace with that. Realizing I‚Äôm meant to be a woman has given me so much strength. It‚Äôs been an amazing last few months, even though I have so many questions about who I want to be, I finally know what direction I want to go. That has made all the difference in the world, but it doesn‚Äôt make me immune to getting hurt.

So, there‚Äôs a lot going on in this situation but I‚Äôll try to keep this brief

1. My younger cousin is getting married in India this January to his wonderful gf, who is Indian. It will be a very traditional wedding.

2.He and I are very close, family says we are like brothers,and I‚Äôm close with his gf as well. She is very family focused, and since she has no family here, she kinda already sees us as family too.

3. Yesterday she even called me because it was some brother sister holiday in Hinduism, sorry I can‚Äôt recall the name, and said 
‚ÄúI hope you will be my big brother for ever and ever‚Äù I said I will always see her as my little sister.

4. I‚Äôm not out to them yet. I‚Äôve been on Hrt for 6 months, but not presenting feminine yet. 

5. I‚Äôm pretty sure my cousin won‚Äôt have any problems with me being trans, I‚Äôm not as sure about her. She is not conservative or homophobic at all but... her cousin just got out of a marriage because the spouse came out as trans. I‚Äôm pretty sure gf only herd her cousins side of the story, because she said 

‚Äúof course trans people are real, but he isn‚Äôt a real one, he‚Äôs just been tricked by the doctors into thinking he is‚Äù

My cousin immediately scolded her for saying that, and I haven‚Äôt had the chance to bring up the subject since then. That was about three months ago. 

6. Since then I have brought up trans people a few times and he has not shown any red flags, so I‚Äôve even hinted a few times that I‚Äôm trans. Im pretty sure he‚Äôs oblivious to all this though. We watched Euphoria together and he didn‚Äôt realize Jules was trans until episode 4 or 5. Even though I told him those were estrogen shots she was taking in the first episode.

TL/DR: Coming out to cousin and his fianc√© today. Wedding is a traditional Hindu wedding in January. It‚Äôs going to be my first wedding and I will be on hrt around one year when it happens.

Wish me luck!

A little backstory: I'm 15, ftm trans (started questioning near the start of the year but am finally confident enough in myself to be happy saying that) and out to my small friend group (~10 people, all awesome!) and my older bro (he's not referring to me or anything yet because he's the only family member I'm out to, but he seems to be getting used to it).

I currently don't go to school or see many other people than my close fam and friends (mental health issues, whoo) so I don't have to worry about coming out there, but my mum is catching on. One of the people that work with me mentioned Mermaids to her offhandedly (it's a UK-based charity for trans kids). She's since found my binder and after cutting my hair short (short hair is the best hands down) she was almost certain I am questioning my gender.

So, yesterday she brought it up to me. I am an awful liar, but I didn't want to confirm anything, so I let her go on about how when she was younger, she wanted to be a boy too but she grew out of it (yeah, gross, but I don't think she's transphobic, just a little ignorant). She then said she was going to refer me to mermaids through the person that introduced her to them.

I flat out told her no. I don't want to be out to so many people, and I honestly don't want to seek support for being trans right now. When I need it, I will ask, but right now it's something I can manage comfortably, and being out to loads of people will just stress me out.

She, however, has decided that that means that I can't be trans, and she doesn't understand now why I can still not be cis despite not wanting to get support for it. Can anyone recommend a good way to explain it to her?

(I'm sorry if I come across as ignorant, I just haven't really had anyone to explain how all of this works to me so I'm lost. I don't mean any harm, I'm just not experienced in the LGBT community) 

 I was assigned as a female at birth, but it's not uncommon for me to have days where I sit and look at myself and just don't feel like my body matches who I am? It's hard to explain. Like some days I do enjoy being female and overly cutesy, but other days I can't stand my shape/body and long hair. Is that normal? I don't know what that would be considered. I've also never owned a binder, but since I'm small chested I sometimes cosplay male characters somewhat successfully. I'm ecstatic when I can cosplay male characters from time to time because it just feels right. (Cosplay is the only way my family would allow me to be a male, because as far as they know, I'm just pretending?) I go to college and I'm considering buying a binder so I can wear it to classes on days where I don't feel female to see if it helps.

So I guess if I boil it all down, my main questions are, 

Are there resources to help me figure this out a bit better? I'm really lost on this.

Is there anywhere I can buy a binder in person? My mom can see my amazon. 

Is there a way I can lessen the dislike I feel for my body when I don't feel female?

Anyways, she arrived and we introduced ourselves, I casually asked her what her pronouns were, she told me, great, she‚Äôs lovely and really funny. She told us she was really happy because she had finally realised that she was a woman; she had been really struggling with identifying her gender and had previously had considered herself intersex but was just confused and super happy to come out as a woman and mentioned she had recently gotten her Gender Dysmorphia diagnosis and was about to start HRT and was really really open about her transition, we hugged and congratulated her and there was so much joy and love in the air (she even said that she was not used to people outside of the LGBTGI+ community being as accepting and encouraging as me and B) now,  a hours later, after she had tattooed me and we were listening to some music and having fun, just hanging, drinking and it happened, I mis-pronouned her üòî I managed to stop at ‚Äúhi-‚Äú before ‚Äúhim‚Äù managed to escape my mouth and (while absolutely fucking MORTIFIED) quickly corrected myself and continued what I was saying, hoping she didn‚Äôt hear as she didn‚Äôt react at all, but she definitely heard.

2019-08-19 01:18:18,csa3jb,2,2,"I was assigned female at broth but recently I've been really questioning my gender. I'm only 17 so I know there is alot I don't know but I'm just so confused right now. I identify as non-binary right now and expirience some dysphoria mainly surrounding my curves and chest. I've thought about starting testosterone but I'm so scared that I'm wrong about my gender identity. What if I transition and then realize I prefer being female? I have the same fears with top surgery. 

I have also lived in a emotionally abusive household all my life so I'm worried that what I feel isn't gender dysphoria and instead just me hating myself. 

I've always hated my name for a slue of reasons and I never really felt like my name was me. I unofficially changed my name to a more gender neutral name and I feel more connected to that name then my birth name but I still worry that the reason for that is growing up in an abusive house. 

Honestly, I'm just scared to start transitioning because I don't identify as female but I also don't identify as male so how do I know for sure what I want my body to be? What if I regret becoming more masculine? 

If anyone has anyone has any advice for me that would be great.

Bit, I kinda feel better as a female. When people call me a girl I get flustered and kind of happy, But I don't feel weird in my skin.

Since I have now been living ""The Transgender Experience (TM)"" for a couple of years now, I've gotten pretty familiar with the tropes around being a trans girl, such as:

obsession with pickles (which I don't personally share), and salt (which I do)

becoming a cat girl

diminished libido, possibly to the point of becoming asexual

the fact that many trans girl names end up sounding like cyberpunk hackers

But I must admit I have literally only a few trans masc friends and I don't talk to them/hang out with them/see their memes nearly as much as those relevant to my own experience.

The ones I know of are:

Jayden, Kayden, Hayden

that a lot of trans guys pick names that sound like drowned victorian boys (Oliver, Elliott, Elijah)

that trans guys love protein and bananas

I thought it would be nice to share places I have bought shoes from her as well as create a list from everyone else's recommendations as well in the hopes that someone would be able to google ""shoes for trans women"" and find a comprehensive list! So here goes:

* [Syro](http://shopsyro.com/) - A queer owned independent shoe company
* Amazon - Searching women's shoes by size has been very helpful in finding basics such as flats or sandals 
* Nordstrom and Depop are also great places to search by size!  
* Dr.Martins - A classic for unisex shoes
* Sneakers - Converse, Superga, Adidas, Nike, etc.


I know this is basic but please comment with more suggestions. Especially independent companies or lines by queer and trans people

2019-08-22 12:33:57,ctwsub,2,9,"Hello /r/trans, long time listener, recently first time poster here, and I want to discuss something that I think I have just started to figure out.

There is no correct way that I am aware of to talk about this, so let's starting talking about it incorrectly.

I frequently feel like I read, and am exposed to a ""no my dysphoria is worse than yours, I've felt it longer, and it damaged me more, you just don't understand.""

I cannot even begin to describe how this affected me negatively for years, and please hear me out, because this one is important. 

I've made the following observations from my own experiential perspective:

* You doubt whether or not you are 'real' enough. You question whether or not, despite how strongly you feel, if maybe you have a lesser 'claim' to being trans, even worse you can begin to self doubt tremendously because maybe you didn't feel like slitting your wrists every day, or maybe you didn't know since you were trans your whole life like some of us magically figure out - please remember that each person's journey is personal, gender identity is personal, and each person is going to present and feel differently
* You become afraid to take any action or even speak in the community, despite the fact that much of the trans community is supportive, sometimes it also feels like, at least MtF side, a bit like a backbiting bitches club where everyone acts all accepting in their face, and behind their backs are just...well...not so supportive, and what scares me is that I have this part of myself that feels competitive in this regard to other women / transwomen, but I actively try to control it
* I think I know why this happens though, and I'm not sure it can be helped. People who are trans, we all feel the need to make a 'case' for ourselves which is less about the trans community internally, and more about to the world at large. We're constantly faced  with questions about our validity, and even being able to medically transition requires so much to be in place,m least of which is someone who can believe you enough to write a prescription or 4 
* I think that trans people are just also in a fight or flight mode at the beginning, that we become combative and insecure - before coming out to myself I felt reasonably rock solid about several things, but now, I'm so much 'weaker'.

I was hoping to have a dialog because I want to make the following points for whomever this applies:

* I get it, you're hurting, but try to, if you can, be more supportive because we're all stronger together
* Try to be as honest with yourself about how you feel because exaggeration, and not that everyone is exaggerating, especially in the extreme creates an atmosphere of competition. This is like when folks are younger are comparing injuries, calling them battle scars. Maybe Terry has had five broken ribs and survived an encounter with Fox News, but Cindy used to wrestle alligators in the Australian outback, and yet still, each journey is valid so let's try to support, not-outcompete.

To conclude my initial thoughts:

* Gender dysphoria is not an episodes long stretch of DragonBall Z where we should be charging up and battling for a season
* Supporting each other is key, please understand that the consequences of doing this can actually lead to inaction in others, or even worse, a feeling of rejection and false invalidity
* Please love each other",trans,"Let's frame why a 'gender dysphoria contest' appears to be so pervasive in our communities, and have a discussion about the consequences",1566502437.0,"{'created_utc': 1566477237, 'id': 'ctwsub', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'Hello /r/trans, long time listener, recently first time poster here, and I want to discuss something that I think I have just started to figure out.\n\nThere is no correct way that I am aware of to talk about this, so let\'s starting talking about it incorrectly.\n\nI frequently feel like I read, and am exposed to a ""no my dysphoria is worse than yours, I\'ve felt it longer, and it damaged me more, you just don\'t understand.""\n\nI cannot even begin to describe how this affected me negatively for years, and please hear me out, because this one is important. \n\nI\'ve made the following observations from my own experiential perspective:\n\n* You doubt whether or not you are \'real\' enough.

As of the last two weeks my feelings of Gender Dysphoria have been absolutely unbearable. I am currently dependent upon my parents for housing and college tuition. They are already accepting of me as a Bisexual male, however, it is still a sensitive subject and it took a year for them to process. They are both fairly conservative christians who don't see eye to eye with the LGBT community very well, but they are not against us. My parents approach to my sexuality is ""I love you no matter what and you can love who you want, however I will not support you with this"". 

I am looking to discuss my gender dysphoria with them to seek help from a secular therapist before the end of next week. My dysphoria has only been getting worse and with College starting this Monday I need to be able to lift the depression, anxiety, and discomfort as much as possible. 

I myself do not know how to come out like this. I do not know how to tell my parents that my masculinity makes me feel awful and that I want to be able to change it. Any advice, support, or kind words are greatly appreciated.

2019-08-23 03:34:54,cu8c09,1,3,"Hey all, a friend of mine has recently mentioned to me that she is dealing with gender dysphoria, which she believes to be the reason behind her severe depression and anxiety (she‚Äôs mtf pre-transition). I talked with her about how she‚Äôs feeling, we talked about her mental health a bit (I‚Äôve had mental health issues in the past so we talked about that, I tried to offer support, etc) and - as she‚Äôs got anxiety - I offered to look into resources/communities/etc for her, which she said yes to (though she wasn‚Äôt very optimistic).

She‚Äôs *very* anxious and doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable at all in her body (hence the depression), so she‚Äôs been avoiding going out at all. She‚Äôs been encouraged by her doctor to try and socialise IRL (and I‚Äôve said to keep socialising online when she‚Äôs not up to it IRL) but her doctor apparently didn‚Äôt want to address the dysphoria at all. She‚Äôs not currently working due to her mental health and doesn‚Äôt think that she‚Äôs able to start transitioning just yet (I think this is a location and money thing, not necessarily a safety thing?? though I‚Äôm going to clarify that with her just to be sure).

I‚Äôm just wondering whether anyone is able to offer some advice/suggestions on:

‚Ä¢ things she can start doing that might help her feel more at home in her body prior to her starting to transition (I wondered whether I should suggest she start painting her nails - even if it‚Äôs just clear or skin coloured? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a stupid suggestion or not..)

2019-08-23 03:46:12,cu8gc3,14,2,"So, my whole life I have been in the closet and just recently came out as gay. I was never aroused by girls growing up, but I've been drawn towards more feminine men since I was an early teen. Always the softer guys, with the bit of a voice and funny walk (you know what I'm talking about). Id get butterflies in the stomach, knees made of jelly, the whole nine when talking to guys like that. I'm not at all into macho guys, beefy or overtly manly, not in the slightest. But the more efeminine men, I would just melt for these guys. 

I spent my whole life running from my attractions and sexuality, away from the shame of those feelings. However after having embraced my sexuality, I've had a few interesting talks and have read some things here in Reddit that have given me pause. Most of my life I had never actually known a trans person, but over the past few years I've met a couple. 

So I'm attracted to effeminate men, but I've also found myself attracted to the several transwomen I've met. I assume its because they also put forth feminine characteristics that I'm attracted to in men, even being those men themselves before they started transitioning.

I'm not sexually aroused by a biological woman, however I am towards the transwomen I've known. But I also know most transwomen fully identify themselves as their presented gender. Would a trans woman be offended that a gay man showed attraction towards her? Would she find it problematic that I am attracted to her, but also identify as gay and am attracted to men? Is my question making sense?

My whole life in the closet, no one had a clue. I'm totally straight acting. If I was in a relationship with a trans woman, it could easily pass as a straight relationship... except for the whole identifying as gay bit.

I dont know if I am in the right place here to ask this question, but I would love to have some input and answers to questions from people who went trough the same thing.

So where to start.. Im 21 m and live in Germany. For a couple of years I know that I would rather be female than male. In hindsight I had some tendencies as a child aswell I would say 
(like Secretly wearing ""girly"" clothing).

I outed myself as gay to my mother and a couple of close friends when I got 18. I figured at the time this would solve my anxiety and depression if I could just tell my loved ones.
It kind of worked I guess, a huge burden was lifted of my shoulders! around the same time I learned about trans people and the possibility to transition, trough the internet and television. Sadly enough I never knew about any of this earlier.. 

Since then I always had this question in my head if I would be happier as a woman and if I would feel whole and not as empty and like im drowning? 

Im really scared tbh.
Mostly about my family's reaction and if the option would even be available to transition..

I dont even know where to approach a professional about this to evaluate my options with..

Im sorry if any if this text is confusing im scattered right now als dont know where to go or what to do.

Am i too old to Transition into a ""passable"" women ?

Who do i talk to about transitioning?

Would my Healthcare pay for this?
Im broke and jobless at this moment in time and i fear this will make it even harder to get back on my feet.

How did you approach your family about this ?

I am an 18y/o M that has recently been finding out more about my gender and stuff. I am almost 100% sure I am MtF because as a kid I always tried to make friends with girls (being a kid with glasses and a buzzcut till i was 16 didnt help that front). In my spare time I resorted to video games  and avoiding social interactions. In my youth I played many sports including Football, Basketball and Trap Shooting (Dad forced me to). Growing up with 2 sisters I was able to sometimes, when I had the house to myself, try on some of their outfits. I never thought much of it but I would do that 1-2 times a month. 
My life has never made sense to me, I did things and activities that boys around me did, but I was still always so displeased with life. In my journey to try and fix this I have had 3 lovely girlfriends, joined the U.S. Military (kicked out and given Veteran Status for lying about my Major Anxiety ""disorder"") , and made myself into what i considered ""good enough"" looking. 
Alas, none of that filled my void.
When my last girlfriend and were together I came out as bi to her and my 2nd eldest sister (only person that wont put me in another mental hospital). Coming out as bi to them was so empowering and really gave me hope for my future. Soon after we broke up I was having really bad anxiety and the only thing that was able to calm me was wearing a pair of Jeggings (my only female clothes) and browsing website after website of clothes, makeup and things that I had always been told ""Arent for my gender"".
Exploring into this more I have been trying to get more info and I am also trying to start hormones.
If there is anyone in MN that is willing to help me with this I would appreciate that a ton, I have never been good at looking for what I want because I have never known what I want. But now I know that I want to be a female.
Good place for HRT in mn?
Any help group chats?
Anyone willing to kind of ""mentor"" me in the ways of MtF?
Thank you!

2019-08-26 15:41:49,cvpqq6,0,3,"Ok, I had a hard time writing all of this and making it understandable.  


I need help... no. My friend needs help.  
I need help helping her.  


We met on a website to meet penpals.   
She never had a great self confidence and self esteem. Never. She thinks she's awkward and when her ""friends"" don't let her down, she repels them.   


She already did this to me, she got angry at me and trying to push me away saying mean things she doesn't believe in (except maybe when she talks about herself). Little does she know I'm an alligator and locked my jawbone on her, I'm not letting her go. I knew she felt shitty about all she said, and she was so much convinced I would give her up she did that a lot of times.  


she dreams about studying abroad and becoming a really cute girl, comming out and being able to be herself, to stop lying.

We've been talking for  more than a year.  
So, here what happened.  


Before then, we were only texting to each other (via discord) but about a month ago, we called for the first time . We were pretty much excited, and earing her being so happy just got me even more excited. We kept talking and talking for hours, you know how it goes, two blabbermouth talking together.... But that day, I offered her to send her a few of my old dresses and jewelery, even to make her a dress with my old lab coat, even despite the cost of the shipping france/philippines, for her birthday on december.   


but for that she had to come out first to her familly.   


I encouraged her to take her time and come out when she's ready, but one day, she could not bear it anymore. She told her parents, and it went quite well  


So we thought.   
She was sooo happy. For a few days she was trying to get her mother used to her being ""girly"" but her mother kept saying ""don't feel forced to do that"", and such but I believed she would get used to it and finally accept her as who she is.   


Until the day she sent me this:  


 ""I apologize  
You are someone who is poisoning my minds it seems  
Telling me to be someone I'm not (a girl)  
So I don't want to talk anymore  
Goodbye""  


I was mad as hell. I knew she would never be sending me those kind of messages. I was mad about her familly forcing her to do that.  


So we made one step backward.  
Her self esteem got once again hit.

we keep talking.

and now, she has to leave the philippines to finally be her

but if we don't find a school and a country where she can easily go, she'll have to stay there, closeted, not only for her own safety, but because she won't be accepted  


but, like I said, I'm an alligator.   


She doesn't have a lot of time, so I'm searching countries and universities where she could go to.  
Can you help me  


1) She CAN become cute, even with her wide shoulders and stuff, help me show that to her, please, even if it's not right now  


2) the other thing I need help for...  
Is a little more complicated, so, please, don't feel obligated to do this.  
I created a google doc, there is a chart where I Sort countries depending on:

\-if it's grsm friendly (more trans friendly)

\-hrt and trans support in this country

\-cost of life

\-travel cost (philippine to this place)

\-how to get in

\-universities

\-language

\-scolarship ans such

I can share the google doc with you. (just DM me)

I can honestly do that alone, but it will take time

Any bit of help is welcome

I'm asking that for her, she feels like she's a bother to need my help, but in an other way she doesnt have the time (between her school and everything else she has to do)

2019-08-26 18:12:58,cvrsho,0,3,"Hello......

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I was AMAB, but I've been questioning my gender identity since January. Lots of experimentation with cross dressing, lots of research, lots of soul searching, etc. I've been attending Transgender meetings at the local LGBTQ center. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago, I figured out that I am pretty much just a straight guy who has a very strong feminine side. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I had already got pulled into an LGBTQ group at church. Somehow they got the idea that I was getting ready to medically transition and they were trying to hook me up with a local transgender medical center. I told them that I was still in ""figuring this stuff out"" mode, but I appreciated the sentiment. Since they were trying to do a seminar series on transgender issues, I offered to help develop some of the material since I am a teacher and am experienced with designing curriculum. 

I just got the text this morning that they were taking me up on my offer. They want to start out with pronouns.

So.....

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Is it appropriate for me to still be doing this? Even though I decided that I'm not transgender. I don't want to be doing any sort of cultural appropriation. That said, the amount that I have learned over the past eight months is incredible, and if I could use my teaching ability to advocate and educate about trans issues, that would be awesome!

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Any tips for this? This is my third year teaching high school, and I taught college for just over 4 years previously.

I have so much respect, admiration, and love for other trans people, and absolutely believe that trans women are women. One of my closest friends, who helped me discover I was trans, is a trans woman. She's valid and amazing and beautiful. But, all that being said, no matter how much positive self talk I try, I just hate the fact that I, as a woman, will never be a cis woman. I guess it's some form of internalized transphobia. It's like a pit in my stomach, something I want so so bad, but know I'll never have.

2019-08-27 11:33:56,cw35m1,0,7,"This story took place a few years ago when i was 17. I was questioning my gender (and still am to an extent), and decided to try and make myself feel more fem by shaving my legs and painting my toenails with some polish I stole from my sister. Living with my family and friends meant i needed to keep those choices secret, so i wore pants and socks for weeks at home (tbh i didnt know nail polish remover was a thing then so i though i'd wait it out. 

So here's what happened. I went to a family event where everyone was drinking. Now in Australia the legal drinking age is 18, but with my friends my parents knew i had been drunk before and decided to let me have a few drinks at this relatives house, thinking it was a safe place and they could stop me from getting too fucked up. They were wrong. 

Needless to say I drank waaaaay too much and made an ass out of myself. I woke up the next day in my bed hungover, showered, in clean clothes, and with no memory of the night before after 9pm. 

Later my mom came into my room and told me what happened. Apparently I got so drunk i needed to be carried to the car, then proceeded to throw up on myself. My mum then told me she made me take a shower before going to bed.

It was at this moment I knew I fucked up. I quickly looked under my blanket and realised I wasnt wearing socks and my bright pink toenails were exposed. She told me she saw them and my legs and wanted to talk to me about it, but I was terrified and hungover so I said we would talk it all over later.

When we did start talking, she assumed I was gay and wanted to calm me down a bit because I was trembling from telling her. When I corrected her and told her I was still attracted to women, but I thought I was trans she was stunned. She seemed supportive that night, but for about a week later whenever we were alone she would tell me she didnt think I was trans and it was a phase, that some trans girl changed her mind and regretted hormones and some other shit. 

A couple weeks later I told her I thought she was right and it was a teen phase, and begged her never to tell anyone. A few years later and it turns out I am still confused, but now I'm scared because I know the people I care about most will reject me. 

Im probably not trans, or maybe I am, who knows? I'll sort it out. I just thought some people might have a laugh at my story.

TLDR: Painted my nails, hid them with socks, then threw up all over myself and had to remove them, revealing my inner trans dilemma to my mother and possibly my sister.

Apparently I got so drunk i needed to be carried to the car, then proceeded to throw up on myself. My mum then told me she made me take a shower before going to bed.\n\nIt was at this moment I knew I fucked up. I quickly looked under my blanket and realised I wasnt wearing socks and my bright pink toenails were exposed. She told me she saw them and my legs and wanted to talk to me about it, but I was terrified and hungover so I said we would talk it all over later.\n\nWhen we did start talking, she assumed I was gay and wanted to calm me down a bit because I was trembling from telling her. When I corrected her and told her I was still attracted to women, but I thought I was trans she was stunned. She seemed supportive that night, but for about a week later whenever we were alone she would tell me she didnt think I was trans and it was a phase, that some trans girl changed her mind and regretted hormones and some other shit. \n\nA couple weeks later I told her I thought she was right and it was a teen phase, and begged her never to tell anyone. A few years later and it turns out I am still confused, but now I'm scared because I know the people I care about most will reject me. \n\nIm probably not trans, or maybe I am, who knows? I'll sort it out. I just thought some people might have a laugh at my story.\n\nTLDR: Painted my nails, hid them with socks, then threw up all over myself and had to remove them, revealing my inner trans dilemma to my mother and possibly my sister.\n\nPS: My family wasnt happy I got that drunk and didnt feed me drinks.

So I (22M) recently have been questioning if I'm transgender or not. I think it all started when my mom had a stroke and she went to hospital in November of last year. Like around january the doctors said that she was not doing well and a couple days later i noticed most of her clothes was occupying alot of my closet so I decided to unhang her clothes and put them in a bag to store away in the garage. while I was doing that I was feeling them and noticed how soft they were and decide to wear them and i really enjoyed how they felt and how they looked on me. some of them didn't fit me since I'm overweight so I stopped and I put most clothes in the bag but kept some that did fit. when my dad wasnt home I would wear them around the house. Then like around February I began wanting to buy my own female clothes so I started buying my clothes from thrift shops and then Walmart. At this time I have not told my friends about me dressing up so I would buy and wear female clothes that would pass for guys clothes. I was pretty sad everytime I saw a girl with cute clothes and I couldn't. Then I started getting panties and they were so soft and it felt so much better then boys boxers I fell in love with them. Around April I was at party with friends and I decided to come out to one of my female friends about me wearing female clothing and she was totally ok with it and told me I should tell the rest of my friends since they knew me for years and been friends since a long time and they would accept me. So in the following days I decided to tell my friends one by one and each accepted me about wearing feminine clothing this made me so happy. My female friend helped me out with clothes shopping and explaining different type of clothing. Since then I been wearing more feminine clothes and been more happy since all my friends support me with this. Now recently I about like 2 or 3 months I been starting to be more feminine like act more girly and smell more like a girl I have even started wearing bras which make me feel really happy. Also as well sometimes when I see a girl I sometimes feel kinda jealous about how they look and wish I can look like them. When I look at a picture of naked woman like I wish I can have long hair, have breast, and sometimes when I see a vagina I wish I had a vagina instead of a penis. I have never been happy with my penis because I have always had a really small penis and never been confident with it. Now I recently I been questioning if I am transgender because of that. I have read articles about that I should think about my childhood and I'm not sure if its related but everytime I would play games I would almost never pick Male characters I would always choose female character and in rpg games where I could create a character I would spend so much time creating a female character and enjoy so much dressing them up in cute clothes. I also was always attracted to female clothing and I would mess around acting feminine with my friends. I haven't really felt like I was in the wrong body never really questioned my gender until recently. I'm not even sure if I have gender dysphoria or not.

He‚Äôs a cis straight male and I don‚Äôt really expect him to know anything about trans issues, and he‚Äôs also the kind of person who makes jokes a lot that he doesn‚Äôt really mean so I tend to take him with a grain of salt. At the time he didn‚Äôt really say anything about it other than that I was probably struggling with confusion and should seek out therapy, which my other roommate promptly scolded him for although tbh I didn‚Äôt see it as bad advice. Since then he‚Äôs been accepting and hasn‚Äôt really made much of a thing about it, but I‚Äôm starting to think he might be a little more against it than he lets on. I like to think I have a thick skin but yesterday we got on the subject and he said a few things that kind of upset me.

I don‚Äôt remember exactly what got us on the topic but it was something to do with how ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù my desire to transition is. He isn‚Äôt the first person to say that among people who knew me prior to all this. I guess I kept it under wraps pretty well. But then he says out of nowhere ‚ÄúCongratulations, you‚Äôve elected to be a third-class citizen. You‚Äôll have to deal with people treating you like shit the rest of your life.‚Äù This caught me off guard but I told him that if I was afraid of being ridiculed I wouldn‚Äôt have come this far. I let it go and the conversation continued peacefully until we started talking about the future, in a general context not even just about me, and I told him that eventually I‚Äôd start going by a female name and pronouns but I would wait until I was ready to start presenting female full time before I asked anyone to do that. 

He says he‚Äôs never going to start referring to me differently as he‚Äôs known me too long. I thought that was kind of shitty on his part to say something like that but I let it go since right now I‚Äôm not ready to do that anyway, but it pissed me off. I kind of just walked away and dropped the issue but I‚Äôve spent the last day processing it.

Knowing him like I do my first instinct is to think that he might just be calling my bluff, i.e. he doesn‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm going to go through with it. I think he‚Äôs not going to say to my face that I‚Äôm full of shit but I think he‚Äôs thinking it, that this is just a fetish or some kind of meltdown or that I‚Äôll chicken out and tell everyone it was just a phase or something. I *know* I won‚Äôt, because I‚Äôm just not the kind of person to give up on something important, especially something I‚Äôve come to desire so deeply, but perhaps in his mind he doesn‚Äôt see me that way or refuses to.

At the end of the day I know I can‚Äôt get inside his head without calling him out and potentially starting a fight with him about it but that just doesn‚Äôt seem worth the effort yet. In the end I really don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs thinking, but I‚Äôm hoping I can bring him around to seeing me as I am, yet right now I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible. Some of you would probably say I don‚Äôt have anything to prove to him and you‚Äôre not wrong but at the same time he‚Äôs done a lot for me over the years and I value his friendship, enough to be disappointed if it blows up in my face in the end.

2019-08-28 14:48:32,cwlti1,0,18,"A friend suggested I tell a story here about an experience getting medical treatment at the ER. TLDR at the bottom. 

To start off, here is a bit of information about me and the time that this all happened went down. *(If you don't care, you don't have to read this part, its not dyer to the story, I just think it sets the mood for the type of mindset I was in at the time)* I'll start by saying I'm an FtM and I am Pre-t and Pre-op at the time. So about a month and a half before this I had fallen into a ***DEEP*** depression, after coming out to my mom and she ended up not being very supportive but tolerating me enough because we lived together (we still do), but because of the living situation I was constantly miss gendered and dead named by my mom purposely every day in an attempt to ""try to snap me out of this phase."" as she called it. She'd often go out of her way to throw in false pronouns in daily conversation, as well as repeating my dead name as many times as she could fit in a sentence. which you can imagine made me so depressed. And because I was so depressed I wasn't taking the time to try and present myself as male, because just getting out of bed in the morning was a chore in itself. I hadn't cut my hair in a few months so it was long, binders were a chore to get on and off, I was wearing my packer as a desperate cling to feel masculine it worked a bit, I was a complete wreck and it just added extreme Dysphoria on top of my depression. And on top of all this my normal depression medication that i‚Äôd been on for ***YEARS*** had stopped working right and ended up with me struggling to get through daily life without the need to take excessive breaks throughout the day to lay in bed and just sleep (My meds would eventually stop working altogether a few months later but that isn't important for the story) ***BUT*** at the time I had just met another FtM male (who at the time was trying to figure out their gender out) who I had the biggest crush on at the time and they basically talked to me every day and made me have a tiny shred of light in my very dark sheltered world that they were slowly trying to help me out of it and at the time of this, I was getting better slowly.  


Now onto the story 

I was having seriously bad pains in my lower back to my sides, I immediately recognized this as kidney stones pains because 1. I was prone to them, 2 I had about 6 of them before this one, and 3 because of the depression I wasn't exactly watching what I was eating/drinking and just grabbed whatever I could grab quickly and get back in my room away from everyone so it lead me to drinking a lot of soda and processed meat which I knew fully well cause me to have kidney stones but i didn‚Äôt care it was all just food to me.Well after putting up with it for almost a day in a half just writhing in pain because I didn't want to ask mom to drive me to the ER, along with knowing for sure I‚Äôd get misgendered the whole time, and the fact I didn't even want to leave the house at this point. But eventually I caved from the pain and asked my mom to take me to the ER, she agreed and off we went. I was still marked female on all of my documents, so while it didn't surprise me hearing ‚Äú***Miss*** \*dead name\*‚Äù it still stung a bit. And, after all the horror stories I read on trans right with health care not being good, I was too scared to correct them and feared being treated differently because of it, so I just let it happened. During our almost 8hr nearly 9hr visit that they did and lab work, blood work, everything the need to do all why addressing me as she/her and my dead name. and knowing full well it was Kidney stones I was terrified they'd have to look or even worse touch ***there*** because I had been wearing my packer that day, I knew I would have to take it off for them to examine me as well as show my non supportive mom it was there. It was a mess! ***I was a mess!*** Lucky for me they didn't need to Crisis avoided. So, by the end of my 8hr trip you can imagine how exhausted I was and I just wanted the end of the visit so I could lay down and cry. My mom left to use the bathroom and she told me she was going to bring the car around so I didn't have to walk that far the parking lot was packed so we parked a long way back. So she left. And a Male nurse get ready to prepare me for discharged. I figured they had treated me already there was nothing more they could legally do to me. So exhausted and defeated, I turned to the male nurse who was prepping me and pretty sure with tears in my eyes and defeated look on my face I stuttered out quietly ""can you address me as he/him"" And he paused, looked at me,then smiled and nodded saying ""sure, I can definitely do that"" and the entire time of Getting my IV out, vitals checked one last time and signing papers consenting to being released and all that  the rest of the time he was preparing me to be discharged he used he/him pronouns and after telling him my name (Tommy) he addressed me as that. It was just a small gesture but it made me feel so much better and accepted by a total stranger and because of the small gesture.

TW: possible dysphoria.

I've thought I might be the last couple of years more so than I ever had before, but I'm worried I'm not right? Since I was little I never thought of myself of a girl and would lean towards masculine things, like wearing boys clothes, playing with boy toys and ultimately realizing I liked girls.

I've also never felt comfortable with my body, I hate my breasts and don't like looking like a girl. Sex isn't triggering for me though oddly enough, although I always imagine myself with male parts while having sex. I just never seem to recognize the person in the mirror and usually just avoid looking in one as a result.

1st- My choir teacher acknowledged the email and started calling me Alex in class. She gave no verbal or email response. 

2nd- this teacher had already been calling me Alex (she great) and apparently sent me an email but it didn‚Äôt send through and she‚Äôs gonna show me it tomorrow. (Cause A and B days y‚Äôall) 

3rd- She gave me a ‚Äúthanks for telling me‚Äù email and is calling me Alex. 

4th- Now he gave me a verbal response and in that conversation (he said he was bad with names) said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I need to worry about talking to your parents‚Äù he is calling me Alex and here the attendance thing. He called Alex and my brain didn‚Äôt register that was me so it took a hit second and then the people at my table looked at me like I have 3 heads. Peers will be the biggest issue when it comes to being trans. Cause you know Texas. 

5th- My coach is apart of the GRSM (lgbt) community. She said (in an email that also didn‚Äôt send through wtf google) that she was proud that I felt confident enough to tell my teachers. :)

6th- yeah she just calls me Alex. No response just acknowledgement. 

7th- Was already out to this teacher yeet still sent her the email. Got an email back. 

8th- I don‚Äôt even know if he read the email cause he still deadnames me. And if coach lettuce (no that‚Äôs not his real last name. He‚Äôs the teacher from 4th period) can remember my name so would he. Also totally drew a trans flag in my assignment today let‚Äôs hope that goes well.

This is just a kinda dumb rant, but it's something I think of every time I see one of those posts about someone struggling with their mood post transition. I think a lot of people have this misconception that transitioning is a panacea for trans people. It's not. 

And all I really want to say is that that's okay and normal to keep struggling.

I've spent reasonable chunks of my life traveling, and one thing I've learned is that I always bring my brain with me. I never leave it behind. There's just no way. You always bring yourself with you. There's no escaping that.

And like for me, in my post transition life, I finally began to recognize myself in mirrors and feel good about my appearance. I also became addicted to cutting and have even attempted to end my life on several occasions. Because the truth of the matter is that I have mental health issues that no amount of positive body image is going to cure.

And that's okay.

It's okay to keep struggling. It's okay for things in general to get worse even. That's just life. But if you're happy with your transition, independent of anything else and whatever that looks like, then you're trans enough. It doesn't need to fix your whole life to be valid.

wait let me go back even more and say that i have never worn a dress. Never. I have never worn makeup. Never. I've never worn heels, never gotten my nails done. I've been wearing man's boxers as underpants for as long as i can remember. The only exception is a bra because i have large breasts that need restrained.

speaking of breasts, i absolutely despise having them. I am very grateful that nature allowed me to breastfeed my children, that was an amazing thing i got to experience and the whole being pregnant thing rocked my world, amazing, but i did not give birth to my children, they were all c-sections, so i never got to do the womanly giving birth thing. I don't know if that's relevant but i've never been a fan of my girl parts so not having to push a child out of them was fine by me.

ok so at 17 you would not have known i was a girl during the colder months. In summer it became obvious because i couldn't hide my breasts. I used a non gendered name and all was good.

when i was 21 i met a man, he became my best friend and in time my lover. He is now my husband of 18 years, and still my absolutely favourite person in the world.  He has always been aware that i am not sexually attracted to men (yes, we have sex, we make it work). He knows i only wear mens clothing. He helps me keep my head shaved short. He loves me despite never having seen me shave my pits or legs. He knows i often get mistaken for a man, he's watched me get kicked out of womens washrooms more than once!  He knows i hate my breasts. He has never (not once in 18+ years) called me by my birth name.

ok so now that i've gotten all that out of the way, i'm ready to take the next step. I am ready to live my life fully as a man. I am ready. I need this.

But i am a wife, and a mother, and i don't want to lose that part of me, i don't want to take that part of me away from my husband, i don't want to not be mom anymore. But i do want to be me.

my husband won't ever leave me and my children would support me 100%

but i dont know. I just dont know.

i don't mind being called a woman, ma'am, she, her, etc.  I don't feel like a lady but i don't care of other people call me that. I've been called sir plenty of times too and to be honest i'm not sure which one feels more right.

i don't even know what the point of my post is. I guess just validation, i need some kind of validation. I'm scared to tell my husband because i dont want to change the life we have built together. My family is beautiful, but it would be just as beautiful if i were a man too.

I need some advice. 
Should I come out?

Pros: 
I could use preferred bathrooms at school, use preferred name and be in the boys group for field trips.
I would be able to buy masculine clothing without fear of being outted.
I could get a binder without saying it's just a sports bra.

Cons: 
Parents may not accept me (most worried about my dad. He's manipulative and emotionally abusive)
May be forced to go to conversion therapy (slim chance but still)
May be forced to be more femme instead of tomboyish like how they currently see me as.
People at school may find out (brother is a gossip whore) and thus I may get bullied, since the teachers can't help with that.
May have my phone (only access to my accepting friends) taken away even though I paid for it


I don't know if I should come out. Over all I would be happier, maybe? But at the same time I may not be allowed to be myself for another 3-5 years until I move out. Please give me advice on what you would do in this situation!

I also understand that T could worsen the hair loss, but that is not the issue. My actual question being:\n\nWould an estrogen tincture effect me similarly to how taking pills or shots would?

From little things like playing as female characters in video games and DnD to wishing I could take more major steps like wear feminine clothing, shave my body hair, or start using new pronouns. I can't tell if this is me starting to realize I'm some sort of trans or nonbinary, but for a long time I just haven't been able to shake the feeling that I would have been happier or better off if I'd been born a girl. 

I sometimes feel varying levels of dysphoria from doing traditionally masculine things and I feel really happy doing some of the things I described above. Transitioning isn't really an option or something I've given serious consideration to--financials are an issue, as well as a family that almost certainly would think I was crazy--but I sometimes find myself wishing that I could. 

Honestly as I write this post I'm not sure what I'm trying to get at, just some encouragement or ideas for ways to explore this more feminine side of me would be really appreciated I guess.",trans,Been very confused about my gender lately.,1567144613.0,"{'created_utc': 1567119413, 'id': 'cx8dm5', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""Hi there!

2019-08-29 23:51:22,cx91g2,1,1,"I honestly believe people should be whoever/whatever they feel or want to be. And I don't have anything against trans people. I understand you guys have gone through a lot of suffering because of people not taking you seriously. I honestly support all of you.  
My names Journey/Strixie. I'm a cis female. I have trouble making and maintaining friends in real life so I hang out on Discord a lot. (TL;DR at the end)  
A while ago, a server was deleted because some toxicity was going on, and the owner just couldn't take it anymore. But me and my friends missed it and made an attempt to revive it. It was going great. The new owner really liked Fire Emblem and liked to pretend to be various characters. One day, they made a new account and pretended to be the character Tiki and jokingly made their gender role ""dragon"". Two people; one was a trans man and the other was his best friend, told them it was transphobic and calmly asked them to not do that. They simply responded, ""ok"" and changed it. But then they asked if they wanted to know why. ""Tiki"" said, ""f\*\*innn like, leave me alone""  
To me, they seemed kind of annoyed. They had done what they wanted and got rid of the role but their fun had been a bit ruined. One of them said, ""we're not bullying you, sweetie"" the other pointed out that it sounded rude. This was when everything got out of control.  
Tiki had stopped responding. I don't know for sure, but I think the person behind the Tiki account might be genderfluid. They really support the trans community. In another server, they said they felt terrible and sick of themselves for acting transphobic.  
Meanwhile, on the first server, two other people joined(one of whom is an enemy of mine but that issue has nothing to do with transgender and their very presence made everything a whole lot worse). Because Tiki had never responded or apologized, they made her out to be a transphobic asshole. And I kid you not, they started insulting her and the rest of the server. Including, ""Who are those oversensitive witches who insult others but cry when you correct them? Or wait, that's half this server"" Tiki said, ""I literally wanted to make a Fire Emblem joke and I can't even- like *W H E E Z E*"" My nemesis said the same thing she always says when she ~~doesn't want to realize she's being an overly sensitive a\*\*hole~~ 's mad ""saying it's a joke is the oldest trick in the book. Another person said, ""Hey, Tiki! Your the why people don't take the trans community seriously, uwu. Gender identity is nothing to joke about, uwu."" Another said, ""what do you have say, Tiki? It's like I have to treat you like a kindergartener."" And later, they said, ""Tiki's suspiciously not responding a lot.""  
Again, back to that other server, the person controlling the Tiki account is visibly upset about what these people are saying and doesn't know what to say.   
At this point, I see what's going on and say that their harshness is completely unnecessary and that it was the reason why Tiki wasn't responding. I say that Tiki just wanted to play. As if it was a ""you're either with them or against them"" scenario, *I* get called transphobic for defending Tiki. Other members of the server were the same. Saying Tiki didn't mean to offend them and understand their joke was read as offensive. But we all agreed that this behavior was uncalled for.  
These people continued to tell Tiki to apologize but that account was offline. To quote one, ""Say sorry you pathetic piece of dog shit. You avoiding us is as radiating as much bitch energy as we are so tough up and own up."" They continued to say that Tiki ignored them even though they clearly didn't. They said that Tiki was truly sorry, they would've apologized.   
I say that everyone responds differently. And, from my personal experience with *one certain person here* it wouldn't even matter if you said so the first time because sorry doesn't mean anything. This somehow stopped though. Don't ask me how, though. I don't know.  
Oh end, no happily ever after. The server was doing perfectly okay 'til this shit went do and 90% yeeted out of there.  
TL;DR: Someone made a joke that ended up offending some LGBTQ+ people. They fixed their mistake but came off as a bit bitchy and ended up getting a wave of terrible and uncalled for insults hurled at them.  
I talked to the people involved. One person believes gender is not something to be joked about. I don't really believe that, though. People get to joke about a lot of things that probably shouldn't be joked about. I understand if you don't like it, though. And I totally see where they're coming from because people poke fun at trans people. That only causes them to suffer.  
I talked to them, and the person behind Tiki genuinely feels terrible.  
I'm honestly confused. Did Tiki deserve the hate they got? Is it okay to joke about gender?

(1) The second month has been quite slow, No real changes that I have noticed.

(2) The mirror is a strange thing. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of her, sometimes I can't see any of her.

(3) Facial hair, I have a shitty home laser that I am using. It is working but really really slowly. I am sure with enough time it will succeed. i don't know if I can wait that long. (My chest hairs are now just turning white after 2 months of use, my face has patches of no hair) I might try an hospital here soon for speed

(4) Breast development: they have grown. they are like fat man moobs. But very big LOL. I have no female nipples yet. I tried measuring my cup size I got 32C (this is obviously wrong if I lie down they disappear)

(5) I don't femme up since staring HRT. I am waiting until I know HRT helps me look better. I don't want to see pre HRT me in womens clothes.

Ôºà6Ôºâ I thought I had escaped the emotional changes. on a few occasions I have felt like bursting into tears.  this is understandable it is really tough transitioning for us all.

(7) I am into girls, I am meeting girls on chinese dating sites. one asked me for my photo. (to prove I was English) I panicked. So i just sent the top half of my face and blurred out my laser shadowed fucked up bottom half of my face. I passed LOL.

(8) Voice training- I am doing ok, I am way off, lots to do and I can't flip to a new voice for 2 years anyway, i will change it as much as I can.

(9) I really don't know how fucked my hair line is lol. I know it is thin on top. I can see new hairs growing I think.

(10) HRT meds became a little tricky to get. This could be a problem in the future.

(11) I am on 200MG spiro and 4mg progynova.  My sex drive is exactly the same. Orgasms are different, No real problem it works fine&gt;

Basically, at one point I wrote a whole letter and gave it to my therapist.  It explained that I want to be a girl, etc, etc.  This therapist helped me tell my parents how I feel.  I asked if I could get surgery over the summer, and my parents said no because it is expensive and because I just recently told them.  I've had hints of gender identity issues since I was five, and I have been sure for about two years.  I know that there are risks, but I'm still sure.  

My biggest issue is this: I don't want to have a slow transition and tell people my new name and so on.  I want to wake up tomorrow as a girl.  I don't want to change my future, I wish my past would change.  I know this isn't possible.  What's the closest thing? Waiting till I am 18 and transition.  Making new friends, and starting a new life.  But, that won't work.  I don't want to forget everyone in my past.  What about my family? What about my friends?

My current plan is thus - talk to my therapist about hormones and eventually surgery, and transition.  This causes me to fear how my fellow students will react.

The final and biggest problem is this.  I can manage as I am now, and I would love to be transitioned, but I fear the middle stages.  I don't want to be seen in my middle stages.  Ideally, I would take a high dosage of hormones starting late in the school year.   Get surgery late in the summer, and return to school as a whole new person.

I don't know what to do.  Please give me some advice (:

2019-08-31 05:03:27,cxrzq6,8,16,"First off, I'm a ftm trans masculine person who hasn't undergone any medical transition. I'm socially transitioning and present as a male and have been for months now. I had heard rumors about hair stylists refusing to do trans people's hair, but I'd never imagined that my hair would be ruined the way it was.

What happened is I went to a fairly popular haircutting chain this morning. I checked in and got in line and waited for the one stylist available to finish up the other clients in front of me. She was an older woman, and she finished up the two men before me fairly quickly, and their hair ended up decent enough.

I had two pictures with me of two different styles I liked. I had wanted long bangs for years, and so I spent over six months growing out all of my hair until it reached shoulder length. It was long, thick, and perfect for the kind of bangs I wanted to have.

The woman called me over, washed my hair, then asked me what I wanted to do to my hair. I showed her the two pictures, and she said that one of the styles I was considering wouldn't work well with my rounder face, and so I told her I wanted the other one, and she agreed to do it. Keep in mind, the picture was of a butch woman with the cut I wanted, that'll be important later. Once we'd agreed, the stylist had me remove my glasses so she could cut my hair (a regular occurance when I get a trim or haircut). She began hacking away at my hair, and I knew she had fucked up my bangs. I just didn't realize how much until much too late.

She finished cutting my hair, dried it with a hairdrier, then handed me my glasses to look at the end result.

I was horrified. She'd chopped off way too much hair, my bangs barely had an inch covering my face, and it was a woman's pixie cut. Nothing like I had asked for from her.

I had to fight back tears as I told her, ""This isn't the haircut that I asked for.""

She only laughed and said, ""That was a man's haircut! You can't have that, you're a girl!""

I repeated what I had said two more times, making it pretty obvious I was unhappy with what she had done to me, but she only repeated what she had told me. Then she fluffed my hair up to make it look larger and said, ""Look! I made you look cuter than before!""

She made me pay for the hack job she had done on my hair, and I practically ran from the shop, close to tears.

I walked a few shops over to a nail salon my mother was getting a pedicure at and as soon as I walked in as she was paying, she knew it was nothing like the photo I had showed her. She finished paying then we walked to the car, and I burst into tears. She had no clue what to do. All of my hair was gone, on the floor in the haircutting place I had just left. I had no more than three to four inches of hair on the top of my head left to work with, and I didn't know what to do.

My mom and I drove to my sister's house, and she got to work trying to salvage my hair. It wasn't that the haircut itself was bad, as it could look nice on someone who wanted it like that!

Be careful where you get your hair done, my friends. I know hair can be a big part of your transition, and this has left me feeling horrible. Ask your stylist if they'd be willing to give you the haircut you want, and double and triple check. Don't end up like I have.",trans,A Hair Stylist Ruined My Hair Today,1567253007.0,"{'created_utc': 1567227807, 'id': 'cxrzq6', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 16, 'selftext': 'First off, I\'m a ftm trans masculine person who hasn\'t undergone any medical transition. I\'m socially transitioning and present as a male and have been for months now. I had heard rumors about hair stylists refusing to do trans people\'s hair, but I\'d never imagined that my hair would be ruined the way it was.\n\nWhat happened is I went to a fairly popular haircutting chain this morning. I checked in and got in line and waited for the one stylist available to finish up the other clients in front of me. She was an older woman, and she finished up the two men before me fairly quickly, and their hair ended up decent enough.\n\nI had two pictures with me of two different styles I liked. I had wanted long bangs for years, and so I spent over six months growing out all of my hair until it reached shoulder length. It was long, thick, and perfect for the kind of bangs I wanted to have.\n\nThe woman called me over, washed my hair, then asked me what I wanted to do to my hair. I showed her the two pictures, and she said that one of the styles I was considering wouldn\'t work well with my rounder face, and so I told her I wanted the other one, and she agreed to do it. Keep in mind, the picture was of a butch woman with the cut I wanted, that\'ll be important later. Once we\'d agreed, the stylist had me remove my glasses so she could cut my hair (a regular occurance when I get a trim or haircut). She began hacking away at my hair, and I knew she had fucked up my bangs. I just didn\'t realize how much until much too late.\n\nShe finished cutting my hair, dried it with a hairdrier, then handed me my glasses to look at the end result.\n\nI was horrified. She\'d chopped off way too much hair, my bangs barely had an inch covering my face, and it was a woman\'s pixie cut. Nothing like I had asked for from her.\n\nI had to fight back tears as I told her, ""This isn\'t the haircut that I asked for.""\n\nShe only laughed and said, ""That was a man\'s haircut! You can\'t have that, you\'re a girl!""\n\nI repeated what I had said two more times, making it pretty obvious I was unhappy with what she had done to me, but she only repeated what she had told me. Then she fluffed my hair up to make it look larger and said, ""Look! I made you look cuter than before!""\n\nShe made me pay for the hack job she had done on my hair, and I practically ran from the shop, close to tears.\n\nI walked a few shops over to a nail salon my mother was getting a pedicure at and as soon as I walked in as she was paying, she knew it was nothing like the photo I had showed her. She finished paying then we walked to the car, and I burst into tears. She had no clue what to do. All of my hair was gone, on the floor in the haircutting place I had just left. I had no more than three to four inches of hair on the top of my head left to work with, and I didn\'t know what to do.\n\nMy mom and I drove to my sister\'s house, and she got to work trying to salvage my hair. It wasn\'t that the haircut itself was bad, as it could look nice on someone who wanted it like that! But I hadn\'t wanted anything like that, and so my sister is scheduling me an appointment with her stylist, and we\'ve emailed corporate, left a review on Yelp, and on Google Reviews (which was deleted not ten hours after posting).

2019-08-31 23:34:26,cy2pib,2,4,"Key words there being 'supposed to.' I had an appointment with a doctor. One my roommate recommended. I had asked them over the phone if they take Medicaid, which is my secondary insurance, and they said they didn't, but they did take my primary insurance, so they'd just take that. So yesterday, I had an appointment with the doctor to get my blood drawn to see if I could start HRT. But I got to the front desk, and it came up that I have Medicaid. The lady at the desk asked if it was my primary or secondary insurance. I was unsure at the time. She said that if it was my primary insurance, I'd have to pay the full price. I said that I was pretty sure it was my secondary insurance, as my psychiatrist took it as my secondary insurance. She then said that the doctor could not see me AT ALL. Why? Because I have Medicaid. It's not my primary insurance, and my primary insurance that doctor took. But nope. They wouldn't see me AT. ALL. because I have Medicaid. So I leave the doctor's office, practically in tears, because that was the day I was supposed to get ready to FINALLY start HRT. It was going to be great. I was going to finally, FINALLY be closer to myself. So my roommate, who had taken me to the appointment (and was also angry. She's looking for a new doctor after that), took me to her office at work because she didn't trust me to be alone in my upset state (I have a history of self-harm and suicidal tendencies. I don't self-harm anymore, but I had strongly expressed wanting to die, so she didn't trust me alone.) Once we got there, she said to turn my anger into something productive. So I did, and I called my Medicaid advisor and asked for some numbers of endocrinologists who take Medicaid. A few minutes later, he sent me five numbers to call. Now, I have a specific branch of Medicaid called Amerigroup. So we had to find endocrinologists who take that specific type of Medicaid. Supposedly, all of these did. However, two of them WERE endocrinologists, but they didn't prescribe HRT. The other three refused to see me because I'm over eighteen, and they only saw children under the age of eighteen. So I told my advisor, and he got me four more numbers. And apparently, not one of these doctors took Amerigroup. They took Medicaid, but not Amerigroup. So that's nine numbers I'd called, and none of them worked out. So my roommate and I started calling numbers we found online. I found a number that didn't take medicaid, but did take my primary insurance. So I gave her my insurance information, and she said the insurance wouldn't pay for the appointment because I had high deductibles, and I'd have to pay for the entire appointment. That was two hundred dollars. I don't have the money for that!!!!!! So then my roommate and I started calling only numbers that took Medicaid. But none of them took Amerigroup. Two and a half hours and nineteen doctors later, and still no luck. So my roommate and I went to the Resource Center, hoping they could give us something. The lady at the front desk was on her computer for a little while, and gave me a few numbers to call. And a half hour and three doctors later, still nothing. So I was calling doctors for a total of three hours, and I called twenty two doctors, and I still don't have a doctor. I was SO upset. I still am. Yesterday was supposed to be the day I started getting ready to start HRT. I was going to get my blood drawn, and I'd be on my way to starting hormones. But instead, it turned into the worst day of my life. It was awful and I'm so angry. It was so bad that my Medicaid advisor started an entire case about it because he has NEVER seen anything like this, and it was upsetting to him, too. He tried so hard to help me, but none of the doctors would see me, or didn't take my insurance. It's so messed up that someone can call twenty two doctors and be on the phone for three hours and still not have a doctor because none of them take their insurance. In case we didn't know the American healthcare system is F**KED UP, here's your proof. Thanks, America.

I had an appointment with a doctor. One my roommate recommended. I had asked them over the phone if they take Medicaid, which is my secondary insurance, and they said they didn't, but they did take my primary insurance, so they'd just take that. So yesterday, I had an appointment with the doctor to get my blood drawn to see if I could start HRT. But I got to the front desk, and it came up that I have Medicaid. The lady at the desk asked if it was my primary or secondary insurance. I was unsure at the time. She said that if it was my primary insurance, I'd have to pay the full price. I said that I was pretty sure it was my secondary insurance, as my psychiatrist took it as my secondary insurance. She then said that the doctor could not see me AT ALL. Why? Because I have Medicaid. It's not my primary insurance, and my primary insurance that doctor took. But nope. They wouldn't see me AT. ALL. because I have Medicaid. So I leave the doctor's office, practically in tears, because that was the day I was supposed to get ready to FINALLY start HRT. It was going to be great. I was going to finally, FINALLY be closer to myself. So my roommate, who had taken me to the appointment (and was also angry. She's looking for a new doctor after that), took me to her office at work because she didn't trust me to be alone in my upset state (I have a history of self-harm and suicidal tendencies. I don't self-harm anymore, but I had strongly expressed wanting to die, so she didn't trust me alone.) Once we got there, she said to turn my anger into something productive. So I did, and I called my Medicaid advisor and asked for some numbers of endocrinologists who take Medicaid. A few minutes later, he sent me five numbers to call.
