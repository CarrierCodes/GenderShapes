2019-06-01 20:06:28,bvoxcm,0,3,"Last Saturday I went to an weekend outdoor event that I have attended for a long time. I couldn't go for the whole weekend, so one of the main things on my list was to visit two friends of mine, a couple who attend every year from out of town. I'm going to call them Kat and Chaz.

I felt I owed them some time, but I also wanted to tell them that I'd started HRT, because I might not see them again for several months and I didn't want to spring the changes on them the next time I see them.

There was some revelry going on, and Chaz is a charismatic ringleader, so he was more busy running things. But, as is common for guys, he's also a little bit shyer when talking about personal things. Consequently, I ended up mostly talking to Kat. I'm still getting to know her, but she's sweet.

So I got the chance to come out to them, and they assured me that they're quite accepting. I thanked them but said that I hadn't been worried; I just didn't want to alarm them next time I see them if I've changed a lot.

It all went quite well and led to a nice discussion with Kat. She had already known that I was non-binary as of last year, but she said that during that time, she strongly suspected that I was going to transition just by reading my Facebook posts. Not so much diary-style entries, but rather the stories I chose to reshare — frequently stories about gender and LGBTQIA equality with an emphasis on the T. :)

Now, Kat and Chaz are very empathetic and intuitive people, which is part of why they're popular at this event. But even so, I felt validated that they had already anticipated my feelings. In trans subs we joke a lot about dropping blatant hints to clueless cis people, but they aren't *always* clueless about it. 😊

I definitely hope other attempts to come out to people go as well. In particular I have one old high school friend, a fairly awkward dude, that I still need to come out to.

I’m not going to call myself trans out of respect. But, I came out to my parents at the age of 8 that I wanted to be a woman. It’s bothered me deeply (to the core) ever since I was a child. But, I have chosen to not transition. (For personal reasons I won’t discuss.)

This is probably a really common question, but how can I be sure I'm trans? I'm biologically male but have in the past and sometimes still do, wanted to be a woman. Last year I bought some girl clothes and makeup and such and dressed up some in private and it felt nice, especially showing off some lol. But after a week or two of wearing girl clothes in private, and even panties under my guy clothes in public, I decided it wasn't really for me. At the time at least, I decided I couldn't really see it as a longterm thing, but I'm still not sure. Now I'm starting to feel the urge again. How do I know if I don't just enjoy the fantasy or if I really want to be a girl? I know I'm for sure at least bi, I've had sex with men multiple times already, but how can I be sure whether or not I want to be a girl or if it's just a fantasy thing? I guess one thing that's stopping me so far for sure is that my parents and grandparents wouldn't approve. I know my parents would still love me, but I've heard them say some messed up stuff about trans people before, and it kinda scared me away from it I guess. Like I feel like I couldn't ever come out to them or they'd be ashamed or something. I know if my grandparents ever found out they'd disown me for even ever being with a guy. I know my sister wouldn't mind, and probably wouldn't be very surprised, but besides her idk. I'm just really unsure as I'm sure a lot of people like me have been or still are. Sometimes I enjoy feeling manly, but then other times I enjoy feeling really fem. Like the other day me and my sister were at the store and I was wearing these like short biking shorts and I felt really cute and fem for some reason. I even pulled them up a little cause at the time at least I wasn't afraid. I saw a couple cute guys walk past and that made me feel even more that way. I'm just so unsure though, it feels like a really big commitment to consider myself actually trans and not just bi/gay, I guess since I would dress and all that, eventually in public. I feel like the big thing for me would be whether or not I could see myself falling in love with a guy. Maybe that's how I should try to judge it. Pretty much anytime I've spent with a guy sexually in the past hasn't lasted more than a time or two of seeing them so I feel like I haven't really had a chance to find out. Any advice?

I’m super scared about coming out to my family. They could go literally either way if I come out, I have no idea. My sister was cornered into coming out as bi and my parents didn’t super like that, saying she was confused and stuff like that. I’ve overheard conversations where they say pretty homophobic stuff. If they don’t agree with LGB issues, I can only see it being worse with T issues.

I can’t work due to mental illness and am currently applying for income assistance so I can live on my own, but that can take between 6 months to over a year so in the meantime I live with my parents, i.e. I depend on them fully for food, shelter, and money for costs like insurance/cell phone/gas. 

If I come out, I can start my transition earlier, and I will likely need their financial support anyway, but also... what if they don’t accept it? Even if they allow me to live at home still, what if they stop paying for my cell phone? I’m housebound most days. I would hate to lose my primary contact with the outside world.

If I wait until my income assistance application goes through to transition (6 months to over a year.....), I’m faced with the choice to come out then or cut off my family all together. Neither is a bad option in my opinion, most of my family is pretty conservative but there are a few good eggs I’d hate to lose. I can’t exactly pick and choose if I’m physically going to change. And that’s IF I can even afford transitioning. I live in BC, Canada, so it won’t be as expensive as the states I think but income assistance won’t exactly throw thousands of dollars my way. 

Is it smarter to hold off, even though I want to start transitioning asap? My family isn’t the most tight-knit, but they’ve been good, so is it wrong to cut them off? What if I need financial help?

2019-06-05 04:34:49,bwyksv,1,2,"Hi.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if my explanation doesn't make sense or is confusing. I'm not sure what I should mention in terms of what I'm having issues with. I feel like it could be multiple things and I could be leaving out something that could be important to the question I'm asking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a girl and looking back on my life, I'm starting to see that I've been very uncomfortable as one. It was hard to make friends online because I played a lot of games that were played mostly by males and when I would make a friend, they would treat me differently if they knew I was a girl. A lot of the time after these things would happen I would deliberately go out of my way to never mention my gender because I was scared that they would act weird towards me if they knew I was one. Sometimes people would ask me out or creep on me within a day of knowing me. It felt bad because these people would make friends perfectly fine with people of the same gender but they would treat me weird and get mad at me if I didn't reciprocate even if I barely knew them. I also couldn't join team voice chats or talk in games very much because I'm scared and I have a weird sounding voice. One time, someone went into a lot of graphic detail about what they would do to me because I was doing bad in an online game and another time one of the best friends I had called me and asked me a lot of weird questions and kept pushing so that I would answer them (such as my bra size). I've had a lot of bad experiences with this sort of stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, I've always had a kind of ""masculine"" way of expressing myself, if that makes sense. I like to wear suits, I don't really wear dresses and I love having short hair. I've worn boys clothes before and it made me happy to wear them for some reason. I've also had periods where I was really into dresses and makeup but they burned out kinda fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like playing a girl in video games or tabletops either. I feel really.. odd? when I'm addressed as a girl. In fact, I feel kinda disappointed when I am. I'm in a women's gaming group and I enjoy being in it, but I feel kind of out of place, especially when I'm referred to with any feminine nicknames. 

&amp;#x200B;

some brief personal history. i was raised by my mum along with 4 half siblings, (each different dads , all our dads are/were crappy) anyway, my biological father was in and out of my life until i was 8, where he kinda went his own way and maybe once a year i was in contact with him,   


before he went away he had a child with his then gf , and that was that, i grew up not knowing her (he was born female so i will use ""her/she"" for past tense before he came out) i met her once when she was 5 randomly bumping into her and my dad in a store , i was a very depressed/nervous preteen so i did minimal small talk before running out and avoiding them but anyway.   


last year my ""dad"" got in contact with me via FB and we briefly talked about my sister and (will now use he) my dad told me my now brother came out at the age of 8, i also got to briefly talk to him and it was nice, he looks way more happier than when i met him when he was 5., at this point in time i wasnt out of the closet and hearing that he was trans really boosted me to come out also so i did .  


okay sorry for that ramble  


what are the chances of it, both of my dads children being trans, and my brother being ftm and me being mtf, its almost like we swapped,  


my dad still has not read the message i sent of me coming out, after he told me about my brother he seemed to disappear off facebook and i cant find him, so whenever he does go online hes gonna have a shock,  


also just to state, im turning 21 in a week and i believe my brother is 12/13 , im not sure of his birth-year

Do you need gender dysphoria to be trans,


Gender dysphoria is not a mental illness,


Transtrenders,


Gender stereotypes,


Why it's important for someone to transition,


The difference between gender identity and gender expression,


Who classifies as trans,


How accepted trans people are, and the struggles they face.


Who has it worst, ftm or mtf?


Non binary and gender fluid identities,


Why pronouns are important,


He/him lesbians and she/her gays,


Trans people being apart of the LGBT community,


Sexuality for trans people.

I am a 30 year old man in a semi Long distance relationship with a woman (she does'nt know i am a cross-dresser). I have been always fascinated by make up and stockings as a kid but eventually i started cross-dressing in private 10 months ago. Occasionally watch make up tutorials online. I was a heavy porn user trans porn, sissy hypnosis, and cross-dressing porn.

I am getting depressed from heavy porn use, I watch and masturbate every night. I have stayed away from porn for almost 2 weeks now. I was reminded that my fascination with make up started before i discovered porn.

I am experimenting on my feelings but it seems that. I really enjoy the cross-dressing, how i look, the rush. I can stay dressed up as long i want but when i take it all of it feels so dysphoric.

I must penetrate myself with toys while caged and orgasm just to have a satisfying feeling. but still it feel dysphoric when i take off my make up wig and clothes.

I went as far as taking videos of myself and uploading it in porn sites. And i am liking the attention i am getting. It just gives me more excited but after orgasm, I deleted the videos. This becomes a cycle. Longest i left the video is about 1 month it reach 10,000+ views before i deleted it because i believe i needed to stop.

I am kinda confuse. I do not have the desire to transition and live as a woman. I occasionally want to be taken by a man or play with fellow cross-dresser but never done so.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Toni, I use he/him and identify as genderqueer. I am seeking help with a project I am working on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have decided to start an Instagram account called ""Another Day, Another Gender"". The goals of the project are to promote acceptance of gender diversity and expression, push back against gatekeeping and toxic ideals of appearance, and celebrate queer fashion.  

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'd like this to be a submission-based account that has a daily feature post about an individual's gender presentation. The preferred format would look something like:

&amp;#x200B;

\[Image\]

Today's Gender is ""\[Description\]"". Thanks to \[name\] for the submission!

&amp;#x200B;

Examples I have done on my personal account include snarky descriptions, like ""TechnoBabe"" or ""Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun"". That kind of lighthearted, semi-dramatic attitude is what I am aiming for with this project. I think that too often, it feels like the conversations that happen in the community are very negative: about our dysphoria or the rate at which we suffer injustices, and I want to add some fun, positivity, and celebration to the dialogue. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you would be interested in following a project like this, please give an upvote and leave your thoughts in the comments. If you have submissions, feel free to DM the account at ""another\_day\_another\_gender"" with your picture and a clever description of your aesthetic for that day.

Now I've ordered some cute thigh high socks and another set of panties that are a bit smaller because I think I got one size too large the last time as they are a little loose in the butt area. I'm excited and can't wait for them to arrive! And I still can't believe that's something I'm excited about..

I even wore, and still am wearing, a more girly colored pair to work today.. like all day.  It felt great and I want more!

I can't stop thinking about all this.. but I know that I can't even start to transition for a while. Well I'm not brave enough to start yet.

Okay, so. I've been dating this guy for about 4 years now after meeting online. I know I know, go ahead and come for me about the whole ""catfish"" thing but we video chat every chance we get and I basically know every hair on his head. However- I've recently become a little curious about his life outside of ""our life"", if that makes sense? And since we have yet to physically meet, as he's always a bit apprehensive, I decided to do some ""digging"", if you will, on the good ole interwebs. He's always claimed to have no social media, so this seemingly posed an issue in my ""digging"". But, awhile back I had discovered his Mom's Facebook page. So I decided to take another look, as it had been awhile, and look through her friends list to see if maybe he just wasn't comfortable sharing if he had in fact had an account. What do ya know, I find an account with a name incredibly similar to his name- but twisted to a typically ""female"" name. So I click. And it's him. One of the baby pictures that he's showed me before is his profile picture. And so I scroll through the 4 photos that are available to look at and there's a picture of him at prom from 2015..in an evening gown..with makeup and straightened hair and BOOBS, like actual, physical, fleshy tetas. Now, I really don't want this post to come off as awful. And even though I'm almost positive that I'll screw up on being correct with my wording, I desperately need advice so I'm going to continue and hopefully if I get any responses \*crosses fingers and toes\*, maybe you could include any corrections if necessary? Please, educate ya girl. Okay, back to our story. This picture wouldn't have ""shocked"" me in any other scenario, but this guy has always identified himself to me as a cis male.  Here's my dilemma- my first priority with going forward is continuing to be respectful. I'm not sure why he has chosen to not fill me in on this part of his life, and hey maybe he just genuinely feels it isn't necessary information to know (which I actually really understand and agree with if that's the case). But, I'm so confused: do I bring this up with him? I mean, if I were to talk about it, how do I even begin to explain the situation to him? But, on the other hand, should I not bring this up with him? If he's chosen to leave this information out of our relationship for whatever reason, do I really want to break the respect that we've created with one another by bringing this up? But then again, am I losing a bit of self respect by not sharing with him?   


I think I also need to clarify something- finding out this information changes nothing for me. I still love him, or them or her or whomever they identify as, just the same. I still want to continue our relationship together, continue our little life together, regardless of this new information.  


I'm literally so confused as to what to do. Like I said, my first priority is to continue to be respectful to him and the way that he's identified himself to be and how he's created this relationship with me. And don't get me wrong, I know I dipped my hand in the cookie jar when I was told not to- but now that I've got this cookie..what do I do with it?  


Please, oh please, if you have any advice or words or wisdom that I can consider for this situation, I'd literally be forever in your debt. I'm doing my best to be educated and respectful toward this dilemma, but I need help going forward.

&gt;I agree that the hospital has no need to know your sexual orientation. I was more commenting on the biological sex thing being a good idea to ask. Being born with a penis or breasts results in a host of medical risks that those who are not born with them do not face. Even if those parts have been altered or removed. A person born with a penis, for instance, is more likely to be colorblind while a person born with a vagina is more likely to develop osteoporosis. Just two random examples.

2019-06-07 17:49:58,bxxl12,10,8,"Here’s the background...there’s 4 kids(2 brothers, sister and myself). I’m the youngest. My brother(older of the 2) was married with 2 kids. We found out he was gay in 2009. It was certainly a shock at the time because there was no inkling of him being gay. He was married with kids, alpha male, type A personality. If you’re gay, you’re gay. Certainly no one’s place to judge. Though gay aside, he was a huge asshole and no one liked him. Extremely cunning, manipulative and intelligent to the point it got him in trouble. But that’s besides the point.

A few years after we learned he was gay(I’m actually the one who found out), my other brother confessed to my mom and I that he was sexually abused by said brother when they were 17 and 12 respectively. This we learned I believe it was in 2011. We were obviously disgusted and appalled but simultaneously, not surprised it happened.

As far as our dealings with said brother, here’s how it’s gone down. Me- I cut him off when I found out he sexually abused my other brother(this would’ve been 2011, maybe 2012). Mom- last spoke to him about a year ago. Sister- not sure. Dad- brother hits him up whenever he needs something but last time they saw each other was Thanksgiving 2002.

Fast forward to last night. Mom calls me and sends me a picture from Facebook. It’s a picture of a well built woman with two extremely hideous paw print tattoos right above each tit. I tell her what I see and she tells me to look closer. I don’t understand where she’s going with it. She tells me to guess who it is. I correctly guessed my oldest brother. Now my brother is 6’7” 260 lbs so he stood out even as a masculine alpha male. Now as a woman, she’ll stand out even more.

As far as LGBT, I won’t pretend to know what it’s like to be any of the four because I don’t fall under any of them and don’t know what it’s like to struggle with orientation. And it’s certainly not my place to judge someone who is. The fact is before the transition, my brother was an asshole to say the very least, not to mention a sexual predator and coming to terms even with that was extremely difficult despite it not happening to me. Now that my brother is now a transgender woman(and obviously my sister now), I’m finding this even harder to deal with than learning he was a gay man or a pedophile. This was obviously a rough journey and one that began in childhood, but the question is how do I come to terms with this?

The end of school year is coming fast and I'm in my last year. That means two formal events at my school (classical end-of-the-school-year and saying goodbye to the teachers and other students). Both requiring formal clothing. I already told my mom I want a suit or something more masculine. She wasn't entirely happy but soon accepted. (She sometimes offered me a skirt or flats.) Today we were supposed to go shopping for the rest. We talked about what I imagine and what I want. When I told her I would want some shoes similar my dad wears, she asked me if I feel like a girl. We had more conversations similar to this prior, but she never asked me this. (No, she asked me. Once a few years ago when I felt like something is wrong, but didn't know what and answered her that I'm fine.) I knew I have to come out eventually so I just whispered ""no"" and left to my room. She came to me a minute later and hugged me. She started asking me questions but I cried and were scared. She was crying too but I was a sobbing mess. She asked me how long I knew and if I told anyone else. I must say I'm very happy how it turned out. A big burden was at lest partly took from my shoulders and knowing that my mom still loves me and stands behind me is amazing feeling. Of course it's something to process and get used to but now it looks everything will be ok.

I feel like my parents, siblings, and friends think I’m always gonna be read as trans by others (I don’t mind visibility I live in a very safe environment and gender bending is kinda cool and artsy over here).

Sample conversation with my mom:

– Hey dear, I was wondering if you’d like to go to the marshmallow gnome festival this weekend. They have free smores!

– No mom, I really don’t like smores.

– C’mon darling! They are very accepting you know!

– I don’t care, I just don’t like gnomes trying to sell me marshmallows.

– Honey times are changing they won’t bother you. I always see gay people there!

– Mom... gay people aren’t... nevermind. I’m not anxious I just don’t wanna come.

– I understand. You’re safe love. I love you. 

– Yeah... love you too. Have fun!

I swear, every single time my parents think I’m not accompanying them because the transphobic gnomes will get to me! Like people associate with me as a woman why does being trans always seem to be on their mind. I love my family for loving and accepting me and I’m so lucky to have them giving me the opportunity of a great life. But I always feel down when my parents personify me with this trans identity all the time. I sometimes would like it if I was just treated like an anonymous human being and my parents keep on reminding me that I’m different and everywhere I go I need people’s acceptance. In reality people constantly refer to me as a woman because everyone here is very liberal and I pass enough to be categorized as a woman. It seems very trivial to complain about. But whenever I go to a public place they keep reminding me how much things are different these days and back then people would attack a person like me in our area. It’s not the greatest feeling when I’m just getting sun bathed on the beach with my mom constantly reminding me how brave I am and how much no one cares that a person like me is in bikinis on the beach. It feels like I’m only gonna be an edgy gender ambiguous child to my family not their daughter. It also happens sometimes with my friends.

2019-06-09 23:24:42,byqljd,2,2,"TRIGGER WARNING (EATING DISORDERS, MINOR SEX REFERNCES) 

Hey my name's PJ  (19, born Female)

I don't know what I am, and haven't for years. 

Since... Well, since I could remember I have always dressed and acted as the stereotypical male ... I used to take my shirt off to help in the yard, felt very uncomfortable in typical female clothing, I always found  hard making connections with females in a friend sense because I just felt we were never on the same wave length. I even remember praying to God (ironic cause even as a child i didnt believe) to make me a boy..... its all wanted.

As I got older this never went away and I found it got worse when I started to get a chest, I only ever wore sports bras and the bigger that area got the more sports bras I wore... I hated/hate my chest more then anything, I just want that area gone. I have since bought a binder and it's the happiest I've been in a long time but still not great. 

I even got to the point (still recovering) of suffering with an eating disorder which I'm almost certain started because I tried to loose weight around my chest and hips.

Being probably trans or NB is something I haven't told anyone .... mostly because I don't know. I have in-fucking-sane dysphoria surrounding my chest BUT am totally comfortable with it in a sexual situation (I have a 21 year old male boyfriend and I enjoy him touching my chest in a sexual way). So in every other sense i want to cut what i have there off, but in the bedroom it's fine?

I also feel very uncomfortable about my voice and fucking love when I'm sick or have a sore throat because of the deeper sound/raspier sound I have.

I just don't really know what to do... I know that while my boyfriend would support me if i transitioned - he would no longer be My boyfriend (Which the idea of tears my fucking heart 2) and I know that I would loose my connection with my mum and her side of the family . 

And in saying that, I don't even know if transitioning is the right thing to do? I may just be NB and extremely disphoric in which case what can I do about that?

Any advise is awesome, I hope your all have a rad day

So me, my girlfriend and a couple of our friends went out to a comedy night recently. Just a small venue with around 30 people. Multiple comedians up at the front of a room doing some decent bits. All good fun. One of the comedians come on and his whole thing is off the cuff, going off audience interaction. Was all going great, loves his stuff.

Whilst he was telling some funny jokes, my girlfriend was looking over at me, laughing. And he looks at her and asks ""why were you looking over there? I'm on stage here!"". Something along those lines. And my girlfriend responds ""I was looking as Ashleigh"" (Me!). So now she's dragged me in to this, and this guy is not going to let this go.

He goes back and forth between talking about us and other people in the audience. All great, funny stuff. However I am absolutely terrified the entire time.

2019-06-10 15:49:07,byzg21,6,3,"I have to post something. I'm losing my fucking mind waiting on this HRT shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fucking waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting just to find out if I even CAN start HRT with a provider's support. It's making me fucking sick with anxiety. If I can't transition medically, I'm probably going to off myself. That's the conclusion I've come to.

&amp;#x200B;

And waiting on this... it literally feels like my life is on the line, and I'm waiting to hear back. Waiting on more blood work, waiting on word from my doctor, waiting on tons of fucking shit and it feels like I'm making NO progress at all. It's killing me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am making some progress, but it's slowed tremendously due to waiting on this medical crap. My BMI is below normal, my hormones (natural ones) are low because of it, and my doctor wanted to check to see if I have a fucking thyroid or pituitary tumor... 

&amp;#x200B;

I was supposed to get results back today but now because of a damn storm, the clinic is closed today because they have no fucking power. What the fuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

It keeps getting worse and worse. My friend was talking about their top surgery last night and how amazing it looks and how great it is and how they have NO visible scars and while I'm super happy for them and glad that it went so amazingly well, I'm still fucking stuck in this part of my transition and unable to do anything but wait and it sucks. And I hate that frustration because I'm sure it comes out on others in some ways here and there, and I don't mean for it to come out, it just does because it depresses the hell out of me and makes me so damned sad because I'm still just...stuck. I HATE feeling stuck. But I can't do anything else now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'll be able to transition anymore. I feel like my life is on hold. AGAIN. For 2 months I've had the freedom and clarity that comes with finally accepting oneself and beginning to move on with life... And now I'm going backwards. I'm just so sad and anxious and scared that I won't be able to start transitioning. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I know I can do transition socially and by wearing whatever blah blah blah. I've already been doing all those things. And a lot of this is probably just my fears and anxiety amplifying shit... But still. The fear that my eating disorder has permanently fucked up my life and made me unable to go on HRT is just...a lot to take in. I'm so stressed out by this. It would be better if I was waiting to receive my prescription or already been approved or whatever, but I haven't even had the green light yet from my doctor... That's the scary part.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was interesting.. and by interesting I mean uncomfortable. After spending the last two weeks accepting this is the path I must follow and wearing almost exclusively lady undies (lundies?) I decided today I would try to feel more ""male"".. you know, for a friend. So I wore my ""normal"" clothes (closeted, I always wear them in public) with my normal underwear and boy did I fucking hate it. Even at the start of the day when I put them on I was a bit put off and disgusted, it was a bit of a weird shock to me. I may have taken the last two weeks and ran a bit wild with the thought I've finally figured out what was wrong and finally accepted something I've always known, but it was weird to get that affirmation from just underwear. Not to mention, I discovered that I prefer and find it more comfortable for my junk to be all .. I dunno, together? Everything just sits right and sweats waaaaaay less. Why did no one tell me these things!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Other than the underwear, I was having a lot of self doubt throughout the day. Dysphoria didn't really affect me too much, though it still did and I couldn't help but thinking, ""Maybe I'm just faking this and have a weird fetish or something. Maybe I'm just seeking attention and not really trans. I feel OK now, so maybe it was just a phase"". I keep coming back to these thoughts but the answers aren't there and the feelings eventually come back. I mean, I don't find arousal in wearing woman's clothing, just elation and comfort, so why do I keep thinking maybe its a fetish? Why is this so fucking hard? Why can't I just know and be, why must I struggle and do nothing.. 

&amp;#x200B;

The waning and waxing of dysphoria has been a hell of a thing these past couple weeks and today was definitely no exception. The recognition that dysphoria is what I've been feeling and self discovery as to why that might be has only increased these feelings. I no longer can think about much else as of late. Work has become a bit more difficult, yet I do still feel like a burden was lifted. I guess the only good thing to really come out of all this thus far is that I've been taking better care of myself and actually exercising so I can have a more female body, mainly just to lose some lb's and slim up a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you gentle viewer: How do you manage your dysphoria as it wanes and waxes? I can only do so much whilst having a roommate and being super in the closet.. I just don't know what to do. Suppose I should seek out a therapist.. yeah maybe I'll do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh.. and to make matters worse, I can't even look at women anymore without feeling envious over how they look and a super anxious because I WANT to look like they do... and have boobs.. and have a cute girlfriend that I can be super gay with. And the worst feeling is that I don't even know how to be woman, let along a gay women.. shit I can't even be a straight dude correctly.

2019-06-11 21:07:04,bzi6u2,0,2,"Lately I have had some experience with one of my closest friends transitioning into becoming a trans-woman. While I wholeheartedly supported her actions, I hope you can imagine it came as somewhat of a shock. We are still the best of friends right now and I always talk to her when I feel like she needs someone to talk to and we have never been on bad terms because of it. 

Personally, I have Asperger's and this makes me speak more openly to people about my curiosities then I should, this of course equates to me asking some harsher questions about how she realized becoming transgender would make her happy and if she might regret the decision later. She told me that she felt trapped in her own body because she couldn’t find a good way to interact with cis-gendered people in a way that allowed her to express herself properly. To the latter question the response that there was no way for her to regret something she desired to such a degree. Knowing her I never questioned these responses came from the heart, yet I still questioned the ultimate outcome and truth to those words.

To me this response seemed to indicate something more, I personally suffer from social anxiety and I know how it is to feel like when you’re never acknowledged. I’ve often felt as a bystander to a world that didn’t fit my description of how life should be and this left me depressed sometimes, not because I wanted it to change, but because I knew it wouldn’t. This friend relates to me on these things, we always shared that anxiety and alienation to a degree. I think her first response indicated the need to get rid of that feeling of not being acknowledged and this led me to think about how these thoughts had ultimately emerged in the first place.

I’m an aspiring psychologist and I always try to look at these kinds of problems at a more psychological level. To me it feels like the (gender roles) of male and female are composed of stereotypical views on certain types of individuals that encompass a group, In this case male and female.

People who often want to improve their musculature features are generally seen as male by the masses, certain clothes, styles of physical improvement (difference between putting on heaps of makeup and taking steroids as an overdone example) and even preferred colors seem to have some semblance of a connection to the predisposed view on these things that the masses seem to try to abide by. From a purely biological point of view this might arise from the view of biological males and females during childhood (males are more erratic and risk taking while girls are generally more emphatic and collected) not that these traits are negative in any way as these are just kids we’re talking about here. This would mean that any deviations from these views on what exemplifies male or female, would probably lead to a negative view of the person in question due to biological prerequisites that arise from the homeostasis of the norm.

I personally also feel left out of this a lot. When I was a kid up to when I was 16 I actually really liked girly shows and even watched my little pony. I also used to take nootropics and this led to a general interest in medically induced performance enhancement. I ultimately even made my own skin creams with chemicals I sourced on ebay. To people around me this was just weird as they found my explanations to be more similar to woman’s makeup. I often do stuff that doesn’t fit my gender role but only because I honestly don’t really mind how people view me. My friends stay my friends and my family will support my decisions and if my coworkers jokes about me doing something weird I just laugh it off.

Now I don’t doubt my friend wants to become a transgender, but I do wonder if something like this happens because people feel like they’re forced into a binary system when it’s actually a dynamic one.

I can imagine why someone who actually wants to dress in drag might feel like they weren’t meant to their assigned gender, even though all they really want is acceptance.

I’m not saying any of this relates to all cases or my friend’s case but I am generally interested how much of our societal structure actually affects the need to become trans.",trans,Are gender roles an unavoidable obstacle to people who don't fit the general norm of the general populous?,1560312424.0,"{'created_utc': 1560287224, 'id': 'bzi6u2', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ""Lately I have had some experience with one of my closest friends transitioning into becoming a trans-woman. While I wholeheartedly supported her actions, I hope you can imagine it came as somewhat of a shock. We are still the best of friends right now and I always talk to her when I feel like she needs someone to talk to and we have never been on bad terms because of it.\xa0\n\nPersonally, I have Asperger's and this makes me speak more openly to people about my curiosities then I should, this of course equates to me asking some harsher questions about how she realized becoming transgender would make her happy and if she might regret the decision later. She told me that she felt trapped in her own body because she couldn’t find a good way to interact with cis-gendered people in a way that allowed her to express herself properly. To the latter question the response that there was no way for her to regret something she desired to such a degree. Knowing her I never questioned these responses came from the heart, yet I still questioned the ultimate outcome and truth to those words.\n\nTo me this response seemed to indicate something more, I personally suffer from social anxiety and I know how it is to feel like when you’re never acknowledged. I’ve often felt as a bystander to a world that didn’t fit my description of how life should be and this left me depressed sometimes, not because I wanted it to change, but because I knew it wouldn’t. This friend relates to me on these things, we always shared that anxiety and alienation to a degree. I think her first response indicated the need to get rid of that feeling of not being acknowledged and this led me to think about how these thoughts had ultimately emerged in the first place.\n\nI’m an aspiring psychologist and I always try to look at these kinds of problems at a more psychological level. To me it feels like the (gender roles) of male and female are composed of stereotypical views on certain types of individuals that encompass a group, In this case male and female.\n\nPeople who often want to improve their\xa0musculature features are generally seen as male by the masses, certain clothes, styles of physical improvement (difference between putting on heaps of makeup and taking steroids as an overdone example) and even preferred colors seem to have some semblance of a connection to the predisposed view on these things that the masses seem to\xa0try to abide by. From a purely biological point of view this might arise from the view of biological males and females during childhood (males are more erratic and risk taking while girls are generally more emphatic and collected) not that these traits are negative in any way as these are just kids we’re talking about here. This would mean that any deviations from these views on what exemplifies male or female, would probably lead to a negative view of the person in question due to biological prerequisites that arise from the homeostasis of the norm.\n\nI personally also feel left out of this a lot. When I was a kid up to when I was 16 I actually really liked girly shows and even watched my little pony. I also used to take nootropics and this led to a general interest in medically induced performance enhancement. I ultimately even made my own skin creams with chemicals I sourced on ebay. To people around me this was just weird as they found my explanations to be more similar to woman’s makeup. I often do stuff that doesn’t fit my gender role but only because I honestly don’t really mind how people view me. My friends stay my friends and my family will support my decisions and if my coworkers jokes about me doing something weird I just laugh it off.\n\nNow I don’t doubt my friend wants to become a transgender, but I do wonder if something like this happens because people feel like they’re forced into a binary system when it’s actually a dynamic one.\n\nI can imagine why someone who actually wants to dress in drag might feel like they weren’t meant to their assigned gender, even though all they really want is acceptance.\n\nI’m not saying any of this relates to all cases or my friend’s case but I am generally interested how much of our societal structure actually affects the need to become trans."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""Are gender roles an unavoidable obstacle to people who don't fit the general norm of the general populous?"", 'created': 1560312424.0}"

2019-06-12 00:58:36,bzkom5,5,4,"I'll just jump straight to it lol.

I have a few points that have lead me to this question.

Ever since I was younger I used to say to myself ""I wish I was a girl"", used to love dressing up in girls clothes makeup etc and always felt more like I can be myself around girls.

When I was younger I remember wanting to die, like literally I felt suicidal thinking to myself I'd rather die before I put my penis inside a vagina.

Secondary school for me was rough, always yearning to fit in with the popular straight boys, for some reason i really wanted to hang out with them even tho we had nothing in common.
I used to think that I wished I was a girl as it would make socialising so much easier and I could be myself more

Idk if these are a gay shame (like afraid to be a feminine guy??) or a trans thing???

So anyway about a year ago I started to do drag, this has confused me, I have becoming obssesed with looking as passable as possible and the idea of not being upsets me, I have had sexual experiences with guys in drag and I feel more comfortable to express myself sexuallly, it's not that I get off on the fact im wearing bras etc it's that I like the idea of being viewed as a girl. Idk if it's just a kink and I'm blowing it out of propoption??

I don't think I have gender dysphoria?? Id say i have gender euphoria?? Honestly im feeling really uncertain but I feel like if I was trans I would be sure? But then at the same time I feel like if I could pass as a woman in my every day life and be referred to as one then I would be happy?? Like the more and more i think about it I'd love to have curves and boobs, I've always been so envious of them. I'm just really confused.... I know I don't have to label myself but I just feel like if I could press a button and nothing in my life would be different except I happen to be a girl I would love it! But idk if it's just a fantasy and I would regret the decision??

I don't know if I'd have a sex change or even if I'd go on hormones, idk it's just such a scary concept bc I would be way too scared of regretting it.

I know this is probably a premature thought but I needed to rant.. I'm just confused (as I've said a lot lol)

let me repeat that.

TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN!

that is not up for debate.

There are 2 biological sexes. But gender is just a social construct that has nothing to do with biology.

So we need more words to describe transpeople and their sexuality. Since it's a biological fact that there are 2 sexes, trans women who have sex with biological males are homosexuals.

But that tells us absolutely nothing about what gender they are attracted to, since gender and biology aren't the same thing.

That's why they also need to tell us if they are ""hetero-social"", ""bi-social"", ""homo-social"", or ""poly-social"" when talking about their sexual preferences.

So a trans person should introduce themselves like this. ""Hi I'm Tina. I go by they/them pronouns. I'm a hetero-social, homo-sexual, who's only attracted to cis-men."" Or ""I'm a homo-social heterosexual trans woman who's only attracted to trans men with vaginas.""

I'm a male considering doing a transition to female with hormone replacement therapy.

Right now I'm having a good sexual life with a female partner, who is also very supportive about the trans aspects of my personality. I enjoy sex with her, and I like the, let's call it, ""heterosexual sex"".

So, one of the aspects of HRT that really frightens me is that I've heard and read that it causes erectile dysfunction. I want to transition, but I want my penis to stay functional as ever haha

Maybe I am being naive, I apologize for that.

with it being pride month and all, a ""friend"" of mine gave out some pride pins she made. they weren't the little enamel pins, they were almost the size of my palm. she gave me one with the trans colours on it and i thanked her. i didn't really know what to do with it, so i just put it on my pin board once i got home.

""you shouldn't hide yourself!! be yourself!!! own it!!!"" etc. i told her i wasn't by any means ashamed, but i saw no need to let everyone know about it, also mentioning the safety aspects of letting everyone know about it. my close friends know, my teachers know, and i don't think its anyone elses business. and it sure as hell wasn't *her* business whether or not i was out to everyone in the school. again, i don't want that shit to define me, and i don't want to take any risks. she got in my face and got a bit louder.

2019-06-13 11:43:41,c04s2q,4,6,"I don't know much about transidenty but the more I dig in the subject, the more I see myself..
Two weeks ago I wasn't even questioning me, I was a stupid boy thinking I was not that much dysphoric. That probably everyone feels wrong with himself in a way. But I recently met two trans girls and.. I felt so related to their history. I was feeling better and better trying to find feminity in myself. It was already obvious.. 
I was thinking about myself having a kink for so long. For about 8 years now (I'm 18y old now, almost 19). I mean, in my social context, a boy that want to wear a dress it's only a sexual deviance right ?.. So I learned to hate that face of myself more and more and using it only as a kink.. My family haven't helped.. I now shave my legs for two years now. Only because I like the way it feels. And because of the feminine look of it I mean.. This is so satisfying.. And the only thing my mother found to say to me it's ""what's the problem with you ??"" (And we all know how we can care about our mother, and I know she care for me.. she was trying to say ""is there any problem you want to talk about ?"" But she is clumsy with words.. I would even say very stupid. (A friend of mine who work in heavy machinery told me that she was as delicate as a caterpillar D11 if you want to laugh of bit).
I had a girlfriend, it has been a 3 and a half year relationship, she helped me in a way, but blocked the ""transidentity"" part of my reflection. She was saying ""don't think about it, I wouldn't love you if you were different"". (And I realized only 2 months ago how toxic it was, when she broke up with me, cheating on me with her ex). So I kept on the idea that I was only a sexual weirdo. 
So until very recently I have been thinking about how I feel with myself.. and I got in touch with two adorable trans girls &lt;3 I only know them for less than a week and they probably don't know that they mean world to me.. (I'm getting attached to people way too fast. That's a huge problem..). They told me parts of their story about realising that they were trans and shared me mangas and some other things that helped them find out. So recently I have read tons of things about transidenty and even if I'm not used to this subject (and I will probably hurt some of you by accident and I feel already very sorry and I want you to take my *hugs* they are free for you :3), even if that's only recently I got in touch about transidenty, it speaks to me a lot..
So I have been trying to see what I was already doing that means a lot or my vision I had of it. I'll explain..
When I first shaved my leg I wasn't talking of it to anyone. The more I did the more it felt normal to me (and it is). But I loved way more than just the fact that I had suddenly a soft skin but I also had a very feminine looking legs.. that was the most satisfying part of it to me.. I talk about it to Nami (not her real name tho) and she was telling me the same story as mine. But she was still comprehensive towards her true feelings tho..
I then looked at my day to day life and saw the way I liked to do normal things. Even tho I'm not androgynous at all in my gender expression, I quit did few ""feminine"" manner of doing things.. walking differently, the way my hands move when I speak of subjects I like, the way I'm an absolute fangirl talking about people I like or find cute x'3 let my nails growing because they are beautiful :3 finding my eyes nice because they are long.
Looking at me in the mirror, I always did it for two reasons. The first one is removing little black body hair that appears randomly on my skin and the second is the fact I only likes myself when I found feminine lines of my face.. 
But I don't feel legitimate.. I don't feel that wrong or maybe I don't realize it.. but I don't feel sick when I look at me, I do prefer to notice feminine sides of myself but I don't hate myself either.. there is trans people that are way more in need than I do.. so I don't know..

I don't even know yet what I want for myself and if I am actually transgender.. I'm telling this here but I don't know if it's the place or even if I'm authorized to tell that much.. I just.. need clearers answers than the one I've find yet. (I will see a psychologist today, it was about my depression first but then I've find something on me to focus on -that question- so I think it kinda got away with it ^^ So I'll probably talk about that to the psychologist)

Btw, I do try the she/her pronoun currently and I don't know the name I want either.. I quit liked Lily and Lizzie and Milly too (Yes I quit like I/Y x'3 tell me what you think about theses names :3) 
I'll probably ask more help in the few next day I hope it won't bother anyone :3

I think it comes down to three things:

1) They are actually trying to be inclusive (if unsuccessfully).  They are projecting and predicting a world where trans people are the norm and are treated (and mistreated) the same as everyone else. 

2) As with most cis people in the world today, they are probably still uncertain about how to interact with, represent, and include trans people in their work - but they appear to be trying.  The artist states that “she hopes that the ad will ultimately help foster empathy for the LGBTQ community”. I think it is more likely that they are trans-ignorant than trans-phobic - not an excuse, but intentions do mean something. Obviously, I hope they include more humanized trans people to provide balance and alternate perspectives.  And perhaps they should have had a conversation or two with trans people to see the response to this.  

3) Trans means a lot of different things to different people.  Of course some will be offended (and they have a right to be) by fetishization of representations that resemble themselves, but of course all trans people are different humans with one thing in common.

4) Yes, this person (character) is fetishized, but apparently that was the social commentary on mass media that they are trying to make: that the media fetishizes and screws up how we understand human interaction for the purpose of selling crap.  Dystopian fiction always shows things that are jarring or unpleasant - for the express purpose of us going, “oh... that’s terrible.  Wait... that’s only a slight exaggeration of the world right now.”  I genuinely think (and hope) that Cyberpunk 2077 may have that kind of literary merit.  And this can be positive for inclusivity and can promote discussions of gender and sex.  Equality has always been easier to communicate to audiences through sci-fi.  Interestingly, once we see it in the future, we seem to be able to see it as more inevitable and okay.

2019-06-14 12:55:05,c0jrjl,2,5,"This sounds like such a cis question, but how did you know you were a guy? I’ve identified as NB for ~5 years, had the confidence to come out in the last 2, and to present masculine in the last 5 months. Before that, I was overweight, and whilst I was secure in my NB identity, felt that I needed to wear heavy makeup every day so that I’d look attractive in a femme/any kind of way (in hindsight, sorting out dysphoria and dysmorphia without help is a bitch). I still think makeup’s super cool, and like wearing it sometimes, but I don’t need it any more - I’m super happy with looking more andro/masc and finding the confidence to finally shave my head had been the most gender euphoric thing. 

For a long time, whenever I’ve been drunk, my thought process has been that I’m lying and repressing the hell out of myself. That I’m a guy, that testosterone and the changes that come with it are something I want, and need. That’s I’ve only been okay ID’ing as NB because I haven’t really registered that people view me as less andro than I view myself. And I used to wake up the next day, remember that chain of thought and believe that was caused by the alcohol. But now - I’m not so sure. I always wanted the voice change, fat shift + muscle changes, but was nervous about bottom growth. That’s no longer a barrier due to an amazing partner and (frankly) less exposure to cis porn. 

So I now feel caught in a metaphorical head lock - one voice yelling at me ‘you’re a repressed trans guy’ and the other ‘you’re not a repressed trans guy, you’re just nb and very confused’. My question here is - does anyone relate? If you used to ID as NB and now ID as a trans guy, what made you realise? If you’re on the NB/trans masc spectrum + on T, what made you decide to go on T?

That’s no longer a barrier due to an amazing partner and (frankly) less exposure to cis porn. \n\nSo I now feel caught in a metaphorical head lock - one voice yelling at me ‘you’re a repressed trans guy’ and the other ‘you’re not a repressed trans guy, you’re just nb and very confused’. My question here is - does anyone relate? If you used to ID as NB and now ID as a trans guy, what made you realise? If you’re on the NB/trans masc spectrum + on T, what made you decide to go on T? I would really love to hear from a range of experiences, so if any part of my messily explained story resonates with you, please feel free to word vomit back at me; I’d appreciate it.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Question for my trans guys + AFAB NB pals', 'created': 1560542105.0}"

Question regarding HRT - Did you notice your sexuality change/fluctuate after starting HRT? I don't mean with heightened sexuality, I mean preference. Did you become more attracted to another gender, the same gender, or...? Did it stay the same as pre-HRT? I am curious.

It seems many arguments are way off on their own sides and it’s hard to get to a middle ground. 

Anyway, I had a thought, and I hope I’m not offending anyone, but, with the current revolution of eliminating gender roles, and what I male or female should or shouldn’t do by societal standards, whether that’s behavior or dress or whatever, it seems like that trans community kinda feeds the old norm in that regard. 

It almost seems that they feel like they’re the preferred sex, but that manifests as dressing as the preferred sex, having names traditionally given to the preferred sex, instead of helping break those gender norms by simply being whatever sex they are and being however they want and not labeling that to a specific sex’s behavioral trait. Not saying they have to identify as a woman to wear a dress, or to walk/talk/act a certain way. You see what I’m saying?

Anyone else have really bad transition envy? I hate it. It makes me feel like a shit person when I get envious of other people. I hate it a lot. I wish I didn't feel that. 

I was listening to the Gender Rebels podcast the other day and they were talking about it, too, and how you cannot compare yourself to anyone else's timeline because each person has their own unique one and comparison really is just...terrible for mental health. And it is. I've experienced that, comparing and hating and tearing myself down over it... 

The only one, they said, you should be comparing yourself to is you. Compare yourself to how you were 6 months ago, a year ago, hell, a day ago. That is the true comparison that should be being made. 

And I get that, but at the same time, it's human nature to compare. And it sucks. It's not like I want to compare myself to others. Especially when that someone is your friend. It makes me feel like a complete asshole. It makes me hate myself, in a way. I know it's a natural human emotion but jealousy and envy make me feel disgusting and dirty and gross all around. 

But when people boast about their transition and how far along they are and how great they look post surgery and hormones etc it just...makes me feel like I'm absolutely stuck. I'm still over here waiting on fucking blood work (third damned round) to come back a-ok before I am even allowed to try hormones. It's ridiculous. Well, it's not. Logically I know that this is for the best in regard to my safety and health, and that this is part of my process, but it still sucks seeing people so far along in their transition...especially when they're younger than you. Like. Fuck. Why can't I have realized this all sooner and done this sooner? It's frustrating. And unfortunately, part of the process. 

I guess this is sort of just a vent/time-passer while I'm waiting on these damned blood results. Anyways. What's your experience with transition envy? Do you have any? Any good ways to help you deal with it?

2019-06-14 22:23:15,c0q443,2,3,"Hello! So I’ve been pretty sure that I’m somewhere under the trans umbrella for a few years now: Transmasc specifically. Recently I’ve been having some serious doubts involving my body. 
I like presenting masculinely and I like being perceived as a boy by strangers. 
However, when it comes to small groups of people who know i’m AFAB, I’m more comfortable not wearing a binder or wearing tighter clothes, even though these things make me feel less like myself. 
Additionally, I’m comfortable with my naked body, although it doesn’t completely feel like myself either. I recently sent a picture of said body to someone and I wasn’t upset by the situation at all. I liked getting a good response from the picture, and it made me rethink everything. 
I have a good body for a female. However, I go through periods of being extremely sure that I want top surgery and not knowing (usually when people compliment my figure on the rare occasion they see it). I think I’d like my body more if I got top surgery, and there are many clothes I dream about wearing if I got it. But I know I’d be losing a part of me that quite honestly, isn’t all bad. 
So the summary is: I have a good body that doesn’t feel like me, but I can appreciate objectively and I know others can too. 
Does it make me less trans for liking my body objectively, or for sending pictures of it to people I trust? Am I trans at all? Anyone else who’s in this boat or has felt this way? 
P.S. I currently ID as non-binary but I don’t like asking people to use they/them due to social stigma, or it could be that the pronouns just don’t quite fit me. I feel masculine but it comes in strange bursts where I feel very trans and want to change my appearance. Some days I’m mostly fine. And I know the way I wrote this post makes it seem like I have little dysphoria, but I just don’t when i’m naked. The second I put clothes on and see my chest or my thighs, I’m miserable. I think my dysphoria happens a lot more in social situations than when I’m alone or with people I trust.

(Sorry if my english sounds weird, not my first language)

So, I'm a boy and I don't seem bothered by that fact nor being called ""he"". But I'm extremely attracted to ""feminine things"" and I desire a more feminine body. I already thought about take oestrogens but since I don't seem experience dysphoria I'm not sure this is a good idea. 

When playing video games I always take a feminine avatar if there is the possibility to choose a female character. I feel better this way. When watching porn (straight porn) I always identify myself with the girl (I'm bisexual and submissive). I like crossdress when I'm alone at home but my passing is meh (my body is very masculine). So I really wonder if I can be transgender even if I don't suffer in my daily life? As a kid I was really attracted by girl toys and wanted to dress as a girl.  On my teenages thoses ideas were not in my mind anymore. They come back progressively since 2 years (I'm barely 24 right now).

i'm agender and would really like to get back into binding since it used to make me feel really comfortable. i used to bind a few years ago, but i ended up giving the binder away when i went through a phase where i didn't want to be trans or even think about my gender bc internalized transphobia/self hate i guess. 

i had an underworks tritop, and i really liked it. the problem is my chest has gotten much bigger just bc i was in the middle of puberty when i used a binder before, and i'm having issues with sizing. i used an xs underworks binder, and also had a small size that i found didn't bind me enough. 

right now i am a 32FF in US sizes, so there is quite a large difference in my waist and my chest size. when i size myself by doing the recommended around the chest sizing i end up with a recommendation for a larger size, but that won't fit me around the rest of my body. 

does anyone know of good binders that work well with people who have a large difference in chest and waist size? recently i've really been feeling the need to have a flat chest, and would really like some advice from anyone who has had this problem and found a good solution.

Anyway, fam, I've been having a bit of a rough day today, so I thought I would share as it seems to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was one of the first days that I've felt utter terror about being called He and ""possible dad in the future"". It affected me way more than I thought it would. Since I have yet to come out, I'm still a he and expect these types of comments. Overall I have not been having an issue with that, until today. Maybe its because I've becoming more and more accepting of who I really am? 

I was talking with a close friend of mine, who is unfortunately Christian. Not to bash on the Christians out there or anything, to each their own, but I mean.. we all know about Christians. Anyway, we had a bit of a thing for a bit but ultimately her religion and my lack thereof was a big big problem. I've been hinting that there is something on my mind and that I'm working out some shit so she's been trying to cheer me up. Somehow the topic of kids got brought up and she said, ""Someday you'll make an excellent dad, I just know it!"". An insurmountable amount of dysphoria and depression punch right square in my stupid man face and now I'm a bit of a wreck. I replied with a casual, ""I most certainly won't be a dad haha"". Followed by, ""Pretty positive about that"". She obviously doesn't know and was like, ""Oh, you never know you might surprised yourself, blah blah blah"".. I mean she doesn't know and I can't tell her yet. And I'm pretty sure she won't take it well when I do. I can't be upset at her for saying that either but this façade of a man I run around as is starting to break down.

Every day seems to bring me closer and closer to actual acceptance of myself, which is good. It also is bringing me more and more dysphoria and uncomfortability being around people. I mean, I'm already very antisocial and introverted as fuck, like I really need more shit to keep me away.. \*sigh\* its just been a rough day.

 So as the title says i'm kind of confused, that's how i've always feel. From what I can remember of my childhood (because I have very bad memory, and even feel like there is some years completely blank) i've always wanted to be a boy, I would be jealous of my brothers and other boys, I would like be shirtless all the time, do push ups because i wanted muscles, dreamed of having a penis, etc.. 

Then puberty, I don't have a lot of memories of this time because it was not very pleasant, but I managed to find some stuff: when I started to grow breast, I asked my mother when would it stop, and if I could have a surgery to make them smaller, when I first had my period, I was crying that I hated it, I also had a lot of trouble finding clothes that I liked because I couldn't shop in the boy section now that my body was changing, and was pressured to try makeup even if I hated it. 

I've been trying to avoid answering the questions ""am I trans?"" For a few years now, but maybe I shouldn't.. so after some thinking, I feel like I want to look ""like a man"", but not socially be one (for example I like that i'm a lesbian, and I don't see myself as a guy in a relationship, or in a group of guy friends) but every time I see myself more masculine in the mirror, I like it so much (getting a short hair cut, a binder, starting to do some exercise, completely changing my wardrobe with (almost) only men section clothes, has really helped me being more confident) and I also would like to do something about my chest, like reduction or top surgery, even if I don't hate them, maybe because i'm so used to it now, but sometimes I even wish I would get breast cancer so I get them removed without it being my decision, so if i don't like it it's not my fault (sorry if this sounds mean it's just what I really think).

So my question is, can you be trans even if you don't want to live as another gender? Like, I wouldn't want to change my name (well maybe because it's androgynous) or gender marker, or be socially ""manly"", or use ""he"" pronoms.. but I just want to change my body and appearance, is this just a ""look"" thing? Because I don't ""hate"" myself (more like ""i don't care and don't want to think about it either"" feeling) but I wouldn't mind having a male body, but I don't think I would like to be percieved as male.

2019-06-18 17:41:12,c25a7g,0,1,"Hello all!  

Sorry for the extremely long post!   

This is partly a question and partly insight concerning my recent struggles with gender identity and sexuality. Its mostly just ramblings about relationships, confusion and why I think this has been so difficult for me but I am also genuinely asking and wondering how to move forward.   

So, lets get into it.    

**The question**  

this is a question that is likely asked a by a lot of people in wide range of situations.   

*""How do I know if I'm trans?""*  

I am currently asking myself and others that right now, but as valid as that question is, I’ve found that there is rarely ever a straight answer.  

I’m sure any of you who have asked this have heard the typical response about how it’s YOUR journey. It’s a question only you can answer. But unfortunately, introspection in that sense is rarely an easy thing to conclusively come to terms with. People change on a daily basis. Moods and feelings are constantly affected by everything in your environment and because of this, a definitive answer is not as much of constant, tangible thing, but a fluid range of emotions that may never stop changing.  

**The discovery**  

In my experience, the question is akin to an addictive substance. Much like a drug, the first time it hits you, it’s a cathartic experience that is incredibly difficult to replicate.  

When I first came to terms with the fact that I may not be as cis as I had previously thought, it was like a wave of emotion and retrospective realizations. Many of the feelings and habits that I had developed throughout my entire life suddenly made more sense. I’ve never been like the other boys, or at least I’ve never felt like them. I’ve always been more emotional despite trying to cover it up to preserve my façade of masculinity. My feelings regarding things like feminine apparel and mannerisms as well as typically un-masculine sentiments about feminism and gender roles made more sense.  

This retrospective awareness occurred in a relatively short measure of time and brought about a new understanding that drastically changed my worldview regarding the trans issues as well as a new perspective on my own past experiences. Unfortunately, that cathartic wave of insight is not likely to happen again.  

Going forward, the journey of self discovery may never reach a peak like that again. It is far more likely to be a slow, arduous series of small decisions and self discoveries that would result in either the decision to transition into the female that I may have always been, or the decision to remain as I am now physically.  

**Relationships**  

Who is the bad guy? Is there one? It really depends on the situation. Often times, relationships fail when gender identity issues come into play. Many couples harbour resentment towards each other for such feelings, and as understandable as it is to be scared and confused, lashing out by either partner is often the main issue.   

**Time for some personal experience and story time:**  

My personal issue stems from the fact that I have been in a relationship for nearly 8 years now and I love my S/O dearly. She is the most important thing in my life and I would do anything for her. That being said, we are at sort of an impasse. We are both very open and accepting of transgender as well as LGBTQIA+ issues as we have both been exposed to it in the past. We recently came to the realization that despite our being in a straight relationship for nearly a decade, we may not be as straight and cis as we thought. I currently identify as pansexual and she identifies as Bisexual but that is something we are both still coming to terms with and that may not be entirely true for either of us.  

It’s somewhat strange that our relationship being as stable as it is makes this a relatively difficult subject to tackle. We’ve been dating since high school, I’m her first boyfriend and she is my first actual *serious* girlfriend. We are only in or early 20’s, but even as recently as we were in high school, The LGBT community was stigmatized and alienated so exploring our sexual identity was still extremely difficult when we started dating. Now that were more comfortable with it and the world is more accepting, were already together so how do we do anything? That being said, that shouldn’t be taken as if we were settling for each other in any way when we started dating, but since were so committed to each other, we’ve never had any reason to further explore our sexual identities and preferences. We currently have no real way of experimenting or exploring these feelings without potentially seeing other people but neither of us are open to that idea, but with that in mind we do know we both feel something other than straight.  

That being said, with my recent gender identity crisis, it has led to us being confused and unsure of how to feel moving forward. I MIGHT be trans, and she WANTS to be okay with that and support me, but she doesn’t know if she can handle it. In fact, I’m fairly unsure of it myself. We both grew up surrounded by people from every part of the LGBT+ community from trans and gay friends to gay aunts, uncles and grandparents so we are both very supportive and passionate about the community. But that experience doesn’t make the situation any easier when its so close to home.   

Its easy to say, “well you’re bi/pan, you should be able to like me for me regardless of my gender” but I know it doesn’t work that way. Just because someone is bi, doesn’t mean they are automatically obligated to be attracted to everybody. There is still the question of attraction to an individual and we have no idea if she could be attracted to me as a different gender which is unfortunate, but also fair.  

Despite her confusion about the issue, she has been immensely supportive. Fortunately, she has a talent for hair and makeup. I’m slightly taller but we are mostly the same size in clothes, we have generally the same style and fashion sense and we already share clothes quite often. We also go out of town quite often making it easy for me to try presenting female in a comfortable environment. Even though she’s unsure of the whole ordeal, she has still done her best to help me try things such as makeup, hair and wigs, clothing, shaving and presenting female in general. This past weekend we were out of town so she helped me with my makeup, lent me some clothes and underwear, and fixed me up with one of her fairly high quality wigs and I spent an entire day as a female in public thanks to her help. but that hasn’t made her any more comfortable with the idea.   

We still had a great time together, we basically did what we would do on any other vacation, but at the end of the day, it was still weird for her and I get why. I’ve always been her boyfriend, and despite being the same person, its still a large change that she’s not sure she could ever get used to and she’s not sure if she could ever really be physically attracted to me as a female.  

**Now for MY perspective on our issue:**   

I don’t even know what I am, and despite being pan and my sexuality covering such a wide range, when it comes to my gender, I don’t know if I could be anything other than male or female. If remain a male, I don’t see a problem with myself being a relatively femme male, but when I present female, I begin to resent my masculine features and want to be as feminine as possible.   

As much as I understand that it is up to me alone to discover my gender identity, she still plays a big part in my life. With that in mind, our relationship and her feelings serve as another factor in whether I could decide to transition or not. There is a real possibility that I could decide that I want to transition, but it might cause a rift in our relationship. In many people’s opinions, that shouldn’t factor so heavily into my individual identity, but it does. She is important enough to me that there is a significant chance that even if I do end up wanting to transition, I would decide not to in order to preserve our relationship because either gender wouldn’t be worth it without her in the picture. Many would say that repressing my feeling on the subject would be unhealthy and could severely affect my mental health, but depending how strongly I feel the need to transition, I would be more than willing to give up far more than just my gender identity to make her happy.  

I couldn’t lie to her about it either. We’re extremely open with each other, but we’re still worried that this could cause issues later on (mostly with mental health). She also hates that she’s so unsure about it and that she’s effecting my decision so heavily. I almost wish she didn’t know about my internal struggle to save her from feeling so bad about it but I know that dealing with this without her input would be wrong. She deserves to know how I’m feeling and have her feeling be known just as much as I do.  

We’ve talked about this extensively, but we feel like we’ve hit a wall. I might want to transition, but I don’t even know *how* to find out if that truly is what I want. She wants to be okay with it, but she doesn’t know if she can be.   

**In Conclusion**  

How can we move forward in this situation?  We don’t see breaking up as an option or even a possibility, but we also don’t want this to longer over us forever.   

We haven’t fought about it at all and we both see each others perspectives clearly so that isn’t an issue. We’ve even been to therapy and our counselor has told us that we’re handling this far better than most people she sees with the same issues. But that doesn’t change the fact that we’re still confused as to what we can do going forward.   

I don’t know if anyone has any suggestions, insights or even just general support, but anything would be much appreciated.

Many would say that repressing my feeling on the subject would be unhealthy and could severely affect my mental health, but depending how strongly I feel the need to transition, I would be more than willing to give up far more than just my gender identity to make her happy.  \n\nI couldn’t lie to her about it either. We’re extremely open with each other, but we’re still worried that this could cause issues later on (mostly with mental health). She also hates that she’s so unsure about it and that she’s effecting my decision so heavily. I almost wish she didn’t know about my internal struggle to save her from feeling so bad about it but I know that dealing with this without her input would be wrong. She deserves to know how I’m feeling and have her feeling be known just as much as I do.  \n\nWe’ve talked about this extensively, but we feel like we’ve hit a wall. I might want to transition, but I don’t even know *how* to find out if that truly is what I want. She wants to be okay with it, but she doesn’t know if she can be.   \n\n**In Conclusion**  \n\nHow can we move forward in this situation?  We don’t see breaking up as an option or even a possibility, but we also don’t want this to longer over us forever.   \n\nWe haven’t fought about it at all and we both see each others perspectives clearly so that isn’t an issue. We’ve even been to therapy and our counselor has told us that we’re handling this far better than most people she sees with the same issues. But that doesn’t change the fact that we’re still confused as to what we can do going forward.   \n\nI don’t know if anyone has any suggestions, insights or even just general support, but anything would be much appreciated.  \n\nThanks!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'The Big Question', 'created': 1560904872.0}"

2019-06-19 12:14:28,c2g7eo,5,8,"I finally got to a gender clinic yesterday; it’s about 125km from my home, but I made it work because they have a very good reputation and the doctor himself is also trans. Sounds perfect right?

I don’t have a diagnosis from a therapist because my severe depression and agoraphobia and anxiety which are all extensions of my trans-issues make it impossible to be at all productive with my own life. IE holding a job and even brushing my fucking teeth sometimes. So no. I don’t have the official diagnosis. But I’ve felt this way since I was 3 years old. It’s one of my earliest memories. It’s been right behind me for my entire life whether I’ve acknowledged it or not. So I put in the work on my own time and made my own psychological breakthroughs and I *know* that HRT is what I need next. I’m sure you can empathize on some level. 

Anyway the appointment started with some extensive questioning as I was sure it would. As things progressed the doctor interrupted me often saying things like “be more specific” or “when you say ‘it’ [in reference to dysphoria] what do you mean?”  Like, trying to direct me to a specific statement, but it was as though he wouldn’t just tell me what he wanted to hear, but rather push me blindly toward It. I’m sure what he wanted to hear was “I’m a woman trapped in a mans body”. But that isn’t an accurate description. That’s not how I feel. I’m not interested in social transition right now at all; only if HRT leads me there eventually. I want, no, I NEED my brain function. I’m effectively useless. 

I explained that i have been totally clean for almost two years. Even explained that I STARTED using drugs in order to hide from my trans feelings. Explained before I started I said to myself “I’d rather be a dead addict than alive and trans.” 

Anyway in the end he basically told me “based on your description, nothing leads me to believe this is dysphoria over depression, or “drug psychosis” “ at which point my brain shut down and I had to fight back tears. Then I handed him the paperwork I had filled out in his lobby which stated very clearly that I was in the office “to start HRT today” at which point he seemed super confused and said “let’s book another appointment and continue talking and then maybe we can get started” 

I don’t think I believe that he means that. And the follow up was booked for two and a half months away. 

I’m afraid that I won’t survive until the next appointment. I even had the initial blood work results with me yesterday. 

For my entire life I’ve struggled with being suicidal. That became under control while I was waiting for this first appointment; but now I’m so scared that I won’t make it to the next appointment. Or worse I will make it there and he still will be convinced my severe dysphoria is “just depression” or “drug psychosis”. 
 

I don’t want to die. I want my life. I want to be who I was always supposed to be. 

But now it feels like that has all been taken away from me and I’m so fucking afraid. I don’t know if I’m here looking for advice,or just some solidarity. I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. And I’m sorry if I sound like an ingrate. Truly. I’m just so lost now.

2019-06-19 14:49:43,c2i08r,16,44,"Imagine hearing this from your partner...I did recently. 

A few months ago I moved in to my partner's house. My gender identity became a big issue for them when they saw all my clothing. They pressed me to start questioning my gender identity... It is not something I thought about too much about before.

I've always privately transcended gender norms, and I always kinda knew I was trans, but until she pushed me in that direction I never considered actually doing anything about it publicly. It has always been too terrifying for me, I'm pretty sure my family won't accept me if I come out. When I came out to my mom she told me it was a lie from the devil and it was not true...ouch.

While I am trans, I haven't transitioned yet, and I may never do so...my discomfort with my birth gender hasn't overcome my fear of rejection. I have dysphoria but I can usually cope with it. I've always admired and respected trans people who are brave enough to be themselves publicly.
 
I've always struggled with accepting myself and kept the truth hidden because most of my direct family is openly transphobic. I didn't realize before, but now I realize my partner is too. They want ""the old me"" back; the ""me"" that conformed to traditional rigid gender norms because I feared rejection.

I just want to be myself and be loved. When I finally came out to my partner, they kicked me out and demanded my house key. I really thought when I met them, I had found someone who would love me for who I was inside, not just for my external appearance. I was wrong.

So, I'm currently homeless and single, sleeping on a friend's couch. My heart is broken. I don't know what to do.

Trans people are some of the bravest people I've ever known.

You said that you didn't want to be cisgender anymore, and that you wanted to be who you truly feel like. You knew that there would be risk coming out as male or female, but you chose to take that step anyway. You invested and sacrificed time and money into becoming the person you wanted to be. And when it was rough, whether because someone didn't like the changes you went through, or because you were misgendered, you just kept going, fighting for yourself.

That being said... How did you realize you were trans? Have you known it all along? Or maybe it was more like looking at the person in the mirrow and wondering who the heck they are. Like (I'm sorry but I have hard time putting that in words), I was born in a woman's body and I'd probably say I am one, but is that so? I call myself a girl and I hate it, in jokes I sometimes refer to myself ""ya boi"" or like that and it feels so much better! But I don't know if I am a man, because well, I was raised as a girl and there are obviously some ""girly"" things that I like, like the pink color (it's funny how until 50's it was actually considered a boy color and blue was seen as girly) and even in a male body I would sometimes wear dresses and makeup, because why not, sometimes even I pretend to myself that I'm a male crossdresser when dressing girly. And most of my friends are girls. But then again, I was usually perceived as the boyish one among them. Even in a dress and full make up I just look at women, then look at myself and I really feel like a man dressed up like a woman, like I'll never be able to be ""like them"", to really belong. When my father tells me to dress more girly and wear dresses, make up etc, to act more girly, internally I'm like ""oh why don't you go and do it yourself"".  I would ""borrow"" his clothes and toiletries sometimes when I was younger and damn, I wish my boobs could just vanish and I would just have a penis instead, I wish I could grow a mustache. However the though of that kinda freaks me out. I'm scared. Because what if that's just a phase in my case? What if I'm just seeking attention? What if the only, only, only reason why I hate my body is actually the overweight and that's it? What if I just don't fit certain stereotypes about girls that actually many women don't fit, and now I'm simply overthinking?

2019-06-23 20:01:31,c4ar90,0,2," 

It was pride this weekend and my friends and I got fucked up on a bunch of shit all day. At 11 pm, I ground up 7g of shrooms and took a point and a half of molly. I went out with my friend and as we were walking; I realized there was weird energy between us. He got increasingly uncomfortable until we went to an art exhibit and he told me he wanted to be alone. I respected his wishes even though I really wanted to hang out with him and I went home.

I hung out with someone else I knew and got to really know and empathize with them. As we talked, they turned into 6 copies and overlapped turning into a different person. I went shopping with them and as we were walking; I felt my memories go away and my thoughts almost disappear. I didn't even realize we were at the shop until I had changed into a frilly green tank top and green shoes. As my consciousness returned, I felt a crazy rush of emotions and I blurted out that I am a girl. I came out to all my friends of snapchat as a girl before I even realized I did that.

As I came down, I got terrified and confused and I felt super uncomfortable in my skin; I went to look in the mirror and my body wasn't what I wanted. I'm too tall, too masculine, and too muscular for my dream body. My friend returned from his spiritual journey and learned about self-love and fully integrated a lot of aspects of his life. He told me before that he was in love with me and I told him the same back and when he came back; I told him how much I love and need him he said we need to talk.

I sit down and he tells me he isn't attracted to me and he's confused why he's mourning for someone I never had. He said on the journey he realized that his favorite person is toxic for him and that even if I thought he was the best thing in my life; he said falling in love with me was bad to him. I was so hurt even on molly I felt like crying and I just stuck to myself and I left him alone until a little later when he said: ""Why did you storm off?"" I still love you and then the next day he does the same thing and says he loves and I'm his best friend.

After I came down, I felt increasingly horrible until a few hours later I took 2 points and 180ug of acid. I've taken 1400ug of acid and it wasn't so intense for me that I couldn't talk, I thought the cross-tolerance would ruin the tabs for me but I saw 4d tesseracts in the lights, tracers everywhere, and I saw this street light turn into a fuzzy caterpillar. Plus I didn't even realize I was high, I thought I was fully sober during the come up. My friend asked me to stay over and cuddle with him, and on the candyflip, I didn't want too but then he started crying and I couldn't help it and I held him until he fell asleep then I went to my room.

Next day I rolled again, and stacked 2-3 times, I don't know much I took but it could have been .3-.5 grams in the day. I felt a lot better around him and I almost completely forgot about yesterday because of the molly. Later in the night, we went out clubbing with friends and I put on my tank top and dosed with molly, when it hit I started to feel comfortable in my skin again and we entered the club. The bouncers at the front yelled at us and kicked us to the back and I noticed my anxiety start rising very suddenly. My friend got scared of the bouncers frisking us and gave me the molly to hide and at this point, I am levels of paranoid.

We get in and I occasionally get weird looks, basically homophobes. I start to feel more self-conscious and my breathing is getting harder and harder to control. My friend keeps holding my hand lovingly and trying to kiss me and I remember what he said yesterday and I just don't feel it anymore but he won't stop and keeps making moves. Eventually, he goes off and makes out with other guys and does his own shit. I kept watch on one of my other friends who got fully wasted and was acting up too much, I told my sister to watch her while I found my best friend.

He tells me if I want to actually have fun and stop babysitting come down to the men's bathroom and only if I want to stop being annoying. I was concerned so I went down anyway and got in line for the bathroom. There was a bouncer at the front of the door and while I was looking he put his hand down my tank top and squeezed my chest. I was so confused and scared, I looked at him like what?!? and then he did it again with a big smile and when I moved away to behind someone else he laughed and talked to his friends.

At this point, my mentality felt almost completely destroyed I realized who I am but at the cost of my safety and intimidation factor. No dude would fuck with me had I been wearing a t-shirt and used a hard face instead I had to be more like myself. At this point I finally find my friend and I tell him to come along and he says ""Hey I won't remember any of this tomorrow"" and winked. I just felt so disturbed by this point and I fully felt like I was losing my happiness and access to my true gender and feelings.

I really quickly reverted back to before the hippie flip the day before and as my friend and I are walking away, the same bouncer grabs his thigh and squeezes it really hard. We get out of the room and he tells him this and starts crying and says he is starting to feel really scared. I get him, my sister, and my friends, together and we leave to go eat. I navigate them and get them some food and they keep doing drunk shit even when cops were around or when guards told us to stop standing places.

They all kept antagonizing people and starting shit. After we get food, I get the uber and we get back home. One of the girls invites a random guy from outside into the room and they all get more fucked up. By this point, I am through emotionally and all the happiness and certainty in who I am is gone. I take a shit ton of molly, alcohol, and weed then go to my room and pass out.

I was going to take more molly today and go out but I decided to just chill out and let my serotonin machine get back to work.",trans,I came out on drugs this weekend and had falling out with my best friend,1561345291.0,"{'created_utc': 1561320091, 'id': 'c4ar90', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ' \n\nIt was pride this weekend and my friends and I got fucked up on a bunch of shit all day. At 11 pm, I ground up 7g of shrooms and took a point and a half of molly. I went out with my friend and as we were walking; I realized there was weird energy between us. He got increasingly uncomfortable until we went to an art exhibit and he told me he wanted to be alone. I respected his wishes even though I really wanted to hang out with him and I went home.\n\nI hung out with someone else I knew and got to really know and empathize with them. As we talked, they turned into 6 copies and overlapped turning into a different person. I went shopping with them and as we were walking; I felt my memories go away and my thoughts almost disappear. I didn\'t even realize we were at the shop until I had changed into a frilly green tank top and green shoes. As my consciousness returned, I felt a crazy rush of emotions and I blurted out that I am a girl. I came out to all my friends of snapchat as a girl before I even realized I did that.\n\nAs I came down, I got terrified and confused and I felt super uncomfortable in my skin; I went to look in the mirror and my body wasn\'t what I wanted. I\'m too tall, too masculine, and too muscular for my dream body. My friend returned from his spiritual journey and learned about self-love and fully integrated a lot of aspects of his life. He told me before that he was in love with me and I told him the same back and when he came back; I told him how much I love and need him he said we need to talk.\n\nI sit down and he tells me he isn\'t attracted to me and he\'s confused why he\'s mourning for someone I never had. He said on the journey he realized that his favorite person is toxic for him and that even if I thought he was the best thing in my life; he said falling in love with me was bad to him. I was so hurt even on molly I felt like crying and I just stuck to myself and I left him alone until a little later when he said: ""Why did you storm off?"" I still love you and then the next day he does the same thing and says he loves and I\'m his best friend.\n\nAfter I came down, I felt increasingly horrible until a few hours later I took 2 points and 180ug of acid. I\'ve taken 1400ug of acid and it wasn\'t so intense for me that I couldn\'t talk, I thought the cross-tolerance would ruin the tabs for me but I saw 4d tesseracts in the lights, tracers everywhere, and I saw this street light turn into a fuzzy caterpillar. Plus I didn\'t even realize I was high, I thought I was fully sober during the come up. My friend asked me to stay over and cuddle with him, and on the candyflip, I didn\'t want too but then he started crying and I couldn\'t help it and I held him until he fell asleep then I went to my room.\n\nNext day I rolled again, and stacked 2-3 times, I don\'t know much I took but it could have been .3-.5 grams in the day. I felt a lot better around him and I almost completely forgot about yesterday because of the molly. Later in the night, we went out clubbing with friends and I put on my tank top and dosed with molly, when it hit I started to feel comfortable in my skin again and we entered the club. The bouncers at the front yelled at us and kicked us to the back and I noticed my anxiety start rising very suddenly. My friend got scared of the bouncers frisking us and gave me the molly to hide and at this point, I am levels of paranoid.\n\nWe get in and I occasionally get weird looks, basically homophobes. I start to feel more self-conscious and my breathing is getting harder and harder to control. My friend keeps holding my hand lovingly and trying to kiss me and I remember what he said yesterday and I just don\'t feel it anymore but he won\'t stop and keeps making moves. Eventually, he goes off and makes out with other guys and does his own shit. I kept watch on one of my other friends who got fully wasted and was acting up too much, I told my sister to watch her while I found my best friend.\n\nHe tells me if I want to actually have fun and stop babysitting come down to the men\'s bathroom and only if I want to stop being annoying. I was concerned so I went down anyway and got in line for the bathroom. There was a bouncer at the front of the door and while I was looking he put his hand down my tank top and squeezed my chest. I was so confused and scared, I looked at him like what?!? and then he did it again with a big smile and when I moved away to behind someone else he laughed and talked to his friends.\n\nAt this point, my mentality felt almost completely destroyed I realized who I am but at the cost of my safety and intimidation factor. No dude would fuck with me had I been wearing a t-shirt and used a hard face instead I had to be more like myself. At this point I finally find my friend and I tell him to come along and he says ""Hey I won\'t remember any of this tomorrow"" and winked. I just felt so disturbed by this point and I fully felt like I was losing my happiness and access to my true gender and feelings.\n\nI really quickly reverted back to before the hippie flip the day before and as my friend and I are walking away, the same bouncer grabs his thigh and squeezes it really hard. We get out of the room and he tells him this and starts crying and says he is starting to feel really scared. I get him, my sister, and my friends, together and we leave to go eat. I navigate them and get them some food and they keep doing drunk shit even when cops were around or when guards told us to stop standing places.\n\nThey all kept antagonizing people and starting shit. After we get food, I get the uber and we get back home. One of the girls invites a random guy from outside into the room and they all get more fucked up. By this point, I am through emotionally and all the happiness and certainty in who I am is gone. I take a shit ton of molly, alcohol, and weed then go to my room and pass out.\n\nMy best friend keeps texting me to not ice him out but I can\'t feel anything for him right now. Honestly, it was a terrible day yesterday, I told him I needed space today and that I don\'t know how I feel right now.

Im a girl (mtf) living in the south, I’m still young and live with my family so my job is just temporary for added income to buy goodies for my hobbies and stuff. 

I’m working in construction with my step-dad as his work partner and while the paychecks are fat I often find myself on the brink of a breakdown. I feel so stressed out at work from the dysphoria. My day drags on at a snails pace. I feel angry and sad constantly, I can’t fall asleep from the sheer dread of tomorrows work day. Having to force myself to act as masculine guy is eating away my morale, its soul crushing.

I find my stress and anxiety eating up my free-time, I’m constantly looking at the clock wondering how many hours I have till I have to go back to that hellhole of a trigger. I’m so absolutely terrified to even ask for a day off let alone quit, I’ve been in this job for only a month-ish and do not want to seem lazy, or weak. No one knows I’m trans besides my best friends and mom so I can’t tell people whats bothering me. I just tell my coworkers I’m tired or sick as an excuse. I know my parents will be passive aggressive about me quitting if I do, and my mom will just be mean about anything I say. I’m also the only atheist in my family which is horrible, on top of me being the only non-straight person in a Hispanic family.

I feel so stressed out at work from the dysphoria. My day drags on at a snails pace. I feel angry and sad constantly, I can’t fall asleep from the sheer dread of tomorrows work day. Having to force myself to act as masculine guy is eating away my morale, its soul crushing.\n\nI find my stress and anxiety eating up my free-time, I’m constantly looking at the clock wondering how many hours I have till I have to go back to that hellhole of a trigger.

I attract many CIS females in clubs that a ton of guys give me props for since I am usually found attractive, I like the fact that I am different. Fuck society.    


But I wish I had these desires and thoughts inside me but NEVER acted on them before or yet.. Because when I meet a super hot or beautiful trans girl, I want to tell her and genuinely KNOW, that I never kissed a trans girl before her. I am just a typical, heterosexual dude. BUT she is that pretty that I will kiss her and maybe make love or Fuck the shit out of here and make her feel like the gorgeous, young woman she is.

But me kissing two trans girls. One was native american, the other Filipino, it would not make me unique to her.  I will just be some guy with a fetish.  If I told her I never even kissed a Tgirl before, she will feel so special, like, ""Wow he never even kissed a Tgirl before but he thought I am so beautiful that he kissed me. Im proud""  instead of, ""Oh hes just a guy with a fetish"" which im not.  

So afterwards it was interested sure, But I wish I never did it.. It takes away from everything. My first trans kiss won't be magical to ME or to the Trans girl. I will just be a guy who already kissed a trans girl before. It won't be like the first time magical moment that I prove to her I am not like the rest of the guys.

I think about how dangerous world is, and fragile we all are. We can get in a fight and break our hand or get brain injuries so easily, this isn't a video game. It is so exciting.. Life.. Human Emotions.. How easily we can die yet kill.

But me kissing a couple trans girl before make me feel not in the moment. IDK WHY? Like everything would be perfect if ONLY I never ever kissed two trans girls before. Since they weren't the ideal lightskin trans girl I would want to kiss.. Idk its weird

But I don't know if it fits here either. I don't think I qualify as trans. I just need somewhere to put all this, so I hope you'll bear with me.   


I'm confused. I never thought I'd say that. Biologically i'm a man, I know that. But I have feelings I don't really understand. I've always had feelings I don't really understand. I like girls clothes, I like makeup (the idea of it anyway. I like it on other people. I've never had any or done it myself.) I like the idea of being a cute girl and being feminine. I remember my sister playing dress-up sometimes with me when i was a kid. She'd put me in an old dress of hers and do my makeup and i'd feel so good. Even then I loved how it felt to be girly.   
But i'm also not hugely dysphoric. I don't hate my body. I don't hate my penis. I don't feel sick when I look at myself. I'm fine with being a man. It doesn't bother me, I don't feel wrong in my own skin.   
But at the same time sometimes I wish I had been born a girl. I wish I could have grown up playing with dolls, and wearing dresses, and having sleepovers with girls. I wish I had long hair, and a feminine body. I wish that I had a soft sweet voice. There's this scene in the movie 'Synecdoche, New York'. The main character is about to have sex with a woman and she takes off her clothes and he doesn't understand how she can be so comfortable naked. He says something to the extent of ""maybe it's because you have a beautiful body. Maybe that helps. Sometimes I wish I was pretty like that."" She asks him ""You want to be a chick?"" and he pauses before saying ""Sometimes I think I would have been better at it."" She comes up to him, and puts her hand on his back, and calls him pretty. And he starts to cry and says ""Thank you. Thank you for saying that."" That scene touches something deep in my heart. Sometimes I wish I was pretty. I'll never be pretty. Nobody will ever look at me and call pretty. Just writing that is making my eyes water.  
But it's not like I feel that way all the time. Sometimes I wish that I was handsome. But I wish it in a different way than when i'm wishing to be pretty. I wish I was handsome because I want women to like me. I want women to look at me and think i'm attractive. I'm not attractive, I know that. I can get dates but never by my looks. Women get used to me, and like my personality, and that gets me dates. But I wish that a woman would look at me and just want to jump my bones. But that'll never happen, especially not if they knew about any of this. People aren't exactly attracted to those who suffer from an existential identity crisis.   


Sometimes I think about transitioning, but never seriously. It's just a thought that I entertain occasionally. I think 'Well if you want to be a girl you can be, you could spend the rest of your life as girl.' and then I think 'No I can't. I'm a man. I'll never be a girl. I'll never have the experience of growing up as a girl. I'll never be seen as a girl by others, or by myself. I'll always see myself as a boy playing pretend.'   


And it's not like i'm young. I'm in my mid 20's. And i'm a big guy. I'm 6'4, and i'm growing increasingly bald everyday. My voice has been extremely deep my whole life. I have no feminine features. I crossdress sometimes and look at myself and just get sad. I look gross when I try to be fem. I can't pull it off at all. I would never be attractive as a woman. And i'd never have the experiences I longed for. I'll never get to be a young woman. I could, at best, be a woman for (the rest of) my adult life. But that doesn't feel like enough. Ill never have the experiences cis women had and that makes me feel like i'd be even less of a woman than them.  


And then there's all the fears with transitioning. I'm slightly bi I guess, but I mainly love girls. Like, 98% of my sexuality is towards women. I can see a guy and go, oh he's hot. And I have an attraction for some penises I guess, but i'm really picky about them. But at the end of the day, I like my sexuality. And transitioning can change it. I don't want it to change. I don't want to be less attracted to women. I don't really want to be more attracted to men. Not that there's anything wrong with being attracted to men, mind you. But i'm happy with my sexuality where it's at. I want it to stay the same. I want to spend my life with a beautiful caring woman. And what if it changed my personality? I like who I am as a person. I don't want to become someone different mentally. I only want the physical changes.   


And I don't think I could ever find love or affection from a woman as a woman. Not from the type of women I like anyway. I like really pretty feminine women. And I know i'd be ugly if i transitioned. I'd never be able to date or be with someone beautiful. Not to mention the facts that only something like 4% of people identify as lgbt, so my dating pool would be even smaller. And then i'd have to find women within that smaller dating pool who not only liked women but were okay with someone who wasn't always a woman. It'd be really hard to find someone who met those criteria and who I thought was beautiful and who had a compatible personality.  


And i'm terrified of the surgery to get a vagina. I'm terrified that sex wouldn't feel good, and that i'd never be able to be sexually satisfied again. I like sex right now. Like I said, I don't hate having a penis. I enjoy having sex with women as a man. What if I hated it as a woman? Or what if I were to regret it? What if I changed it and then went ""nope, this isn't right."" And I know I could keep my penis, I don't have to have that surgery. But that lowers the amount of people who would want to be with me even more. I'd be even less likely to find love. I don't want to spend my life alone. I'm alone now and it's terrible. I'm so damn lonely. I want someone in my life. I'm much more likely to find that as a man.   


I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm not really serious about any of this, I guess. I feel like a jackass, like i'm intruding into the space of people with issues I don't have. Like i'm playing around with a label that doesn't belong to me. I'm sorry if this post is awful. I feel kind of awful for making it. I can't imagine myself ever changing my gender, not really. I know i'll be a man for the rest of my life. But sometimes I wish I could just snap my fingers and become feminine. I wish I could be someone else. I wish I had been born as like, a cute lesbian girl.

And then i\'d have to find women within that smaller dating pool who not only liked women but were okay with someone who wasn\'t always a woman. It\'d be really hard to find someone who met those criteria and who I thought was beautiful and who had a compatible personality.  \n\n\nAnd i\'m terrified of the surgery to get a vagina. I\'m terrified that sex wouldn\'t feel good, and that i\'d never be able to be sexually satisfied again. I like sex right now. Like I said, I don\'t hate having a penis. I enjoy having sex with women as a man. What if I hated it as a woman? Or what if I were to regret it? What if I changed it and then went ""nope, this isn\'t right."" And I know I could keep my penis, I don\'t have to have that surgery. But that lowers the amount of people who would want to be with me even more. I\'d be even less likely to find love. I don\'t want to spend my life alone. I\'m alone now and it\'s terrible. I\'m so damn lonely. I want someone in my life. I\'m much more likely to find that as a man.   \n\n\nI don\'t know. I don\'t know anything. I\'m not really serious about any of this, I guess. I feel like a jackass, like i\'m intruding into the space of people with issues I don\'t have. Like i\'m playing around with a label that doesn\'t belong to me. I\'m sorry if this post is awful. I feel kind of awful for making it. I can\'t imagine myself ever changing my gender, not really. I know i\'ll be a man for the rest of my life. But sometimes I wish I could just snap my fingers and become feminine. I wish I could be someone else. I wish I had been born as like, a cute lesbian girl.   \n\n\nI\'ve never told anybody any of this before.

Since I finally did it today, literally a few minutes ago, I think I can give some tips now. This will be divided into three parts:  The Pull-up, The Psychological Barrier, and the Shot.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Pull-up

1. **The Testosterone bottles are small, so make sure to get more ordered by your endo.** I do weekly injection shots now, and each bottle (depending on what amount you start on, I'm on .13 right now) holds about 2-3 shots. 
2. **How do I tell the difference between the T and air?** It's actually easier than you think! The Testosterone is lightly discolored, but it looks clear to the ""untrained eye"". You can also see a ring separating the air from the medicine, so that too is helpful.
3. **Take in more medicine then you need before going to the actual amount.** This will help with making sure there are no air bubbles picked up when drawing up. For example, if you have, say, my dosage, which is .13, you would go to .15 before you go down to the actual amount.
4. **Remember to Disinfect!** Always have those disenfectant wipes (the tiny chlorine smelling ones, you know, those ones.) on you. Disinfect the top part of the bottle (which is puncturable) before drawing up. Just a precaution.

# The Psychological Barrier

1. **This is something I dealt with- heavily.** The psychological barrier, as I call it, is a barrier that prevents you from going anywhere near the injection site. It sucks. Its anxiety, whether it be from questions such as: Will it hurt? will it go in easily? or from a fear of needles. So how do you get over it?
2. **For the first few shots, get help from parents or your endo.** This will help you get used to the feeling of the needle inside the injection site. Just a precaution!
3. **Next, go into a room, alone.** if you need help still, get a parent or an endo. In my experience, having people watching me stopped me from preparing myself about the injection. It made me more anxious. You might not be the same.
4. **Get as close as you possibly can to your injection site.** This definitely helped me today. I slowly put the needle on the skin, not enough to break it, but began to poke and prod around the same area. It helped me understand that: ""Okay, this is what it feels like to put the needle on my own skin"". Keep going away and back to the injection side with the needle, getting closer and closer. Soon enough you'll be able to inject.

# The Shot

1. **What does it feel like?** I first thought it would be like putting a wooden stir stick (the tiny, rounded off things you use in cooking) into a pan of cornbread. you know what I mean? But it really isn't. Its a glide, like the injection point doesn't exist.
2. **Does it hurt?** Not at all, if you do it correctly. As long as you're putting the needle in- **straight** in, you'll be fine. The bleeding, if you get any, wont be anything major and will stop quick. There might be a little pinch before going in, and a little pain after the shot, but you'll take it like a champ.
3. **Take deep breaths.** Keep your hand steady, take deep breaths, and stay calm. You'll do fine.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trans MTF, and had been 100% certain of that for somewhere between 9 and 16 months (I really suck at timelines). I don't entirely know what really snapped me into this mindset, or helped me spill my own beans, or however you want to word it.

My whole life I'd just been one of the guys who hung out around a fluid group of people. Sometimes I was with the guys, sometimes with the girls, and sometimes with a mix of the two, but I was always just a guy back in my childhood. I didn't really know that any of this was a thing, much less that it was okay. I spent my life, up until a few years ago, certain that I wanted to grow up to be something manly (but not overly manly) like a sniper for the military. Then again, I've always been pushed towards so many things by stereotypes, that I assumed I had to be muscular. I remember always growing my hair out, less so because it felt girly or right than because I hated having it short. Hell, I used to make fun of myself for being *too* girly.

Coming into Middle School, I started wearing more feminine clothes, stopped wearing shorts, and hating myself for my masculine-looking physique. I don't work out much, and back then I didn't do it at all, but I've always had a little bit of a strong looking upper body, and that's made me kinda self-conscious recently. In Middle School was where all of the ""God you're so girly. What are you, fucking gay?"" kind of shit started. I got tired of it quick, and, being a bubbling crockpot of testosterone, would often resort to violence, which just kinda reinforced my whole ""You're always gonna be a guy"" outlook I'd developed before. For a while during this time, I just wanted to be a trap, a futa, shemale, whatever you personally don't find offensive.

Now, being in High School, I'm suddenly not sure. I'm about to be a sophomore (10th grade for the few who didn't know) and had spent the whole Freshman year sort of ""adjusting"". I went by a different name, I dressed differently, and on occasion I'd even try to speak in a different voice. It felt right. I felt like my entire life before had been a lie, and somehow, some way, I had just disillusioned myself completely. I was entirely in the female mindset and I loved it. The best part? Probably 85-90% of my peers accepted it, and only a couple of individuals bullied me over it. Even with them, it felt fucking amazing. 

Probably a week and a half ago, however, I got a haircut. I'd had something between an undercut and a mohawk, and I wanted to grow it all out. I got it all buzzed off, down to half an inch everywhere. When I was still in the GreatClips, it looked alright. It wasn't overly masculine, I reminded myself, since some girls have short hair too. The problem arose when I got home. After finishing with my nightly routine, and staring myself down in the mirror due to the new look, I nearly passed out. I'd just stood up, so nothing was out of the ordinary, but this time I started fighting with myself in my head.

To put it loosely (and try to not fake diseases I don't have) it was a sort of battle between myself and my old outlook of masculinity. I won't go into the details of what happened, but I came out of the night unscathed, and somewhat more in my feminine outlook, but still with remnants of my old self. More recently, I've been less interested in... ""Helping myself out""... yet when I've been doing things, I've been relating, once more, with male characters more often.

I don’t really know where to post this, how to phrase it, and to be completely honest I don’t know entirely how I feel. I’m terrified for sure and possibly even a bit excited, maybe anxious is a better term for how I’m feeling? I’m not sure how to start this, maybe some background would help. My name is Trixie, I’m twenty-one and have transitioning using HRT since I was seventeen. I’ve always FELT utterly feminine and have believed and been told that I was passable long before I ever started hormones. I wasn’t too sure what to expect from HRT but It seemed like a necessary step in my transition. I didn’t really notice a whole lot of changes in terms of my physical appearance other than a pore less complexion and unnaturally soft skin. About a year into HRT I had my hormone regimen alerted in hopes of significant physical changes, this was all done under the direct supervision and direction of a licensed Endocrinologist. On top of a common Antiandrogen and synthetic Estrogen I was given an additional Antiandrogen and Progesterone. Initially I noticed no changes however about a month or two in I noticed I was constantly feeling like I had some sort of synthetic morning sickness, I was constantly nauseous, dizzy and ALWAYS thirsty (solely in the traditional sense unfortunately) I also noticed my interest in men waned, well let me clarify. I was plenty interested in men, I just didn’t have an urge to sleep with them. I was on hormones for two years before I met my first love interest, I was nineteen years old and nearing my second year anniversary on HRT. We spoke for eight months and eventually dated around for two months give or take. At this point in time I had no experience, I am not exaggerating when I say NO experience. I was nineteen years old when a man held my hand for the first time, nineteen when I had my first kiss and nineteen when I first had any sort of an intimate experience. I won’t dive too deep into detail but I was unable to finish the race and while my partner made a clear triumph he did express disappointment that I was unable to match his success. I chucked it all up to nerves, I eagerly tried as much as I could, pushing my boundaries, stopping short of “going all the way” Unfortunately after a lot of trial and error that seemed less and less to be the case.  Not to long after that he broke up with me, I couldn’t help but feel that my inability to Climax spearheaded his decision to end things with me. Not to long after I had a follow up with my Endocrinologist and complained about the constant feeling of nausea. It came to light that I was almost double where I needed to be at in terms of HRT levels and some major changes were to come. I was embarrassed to bring up my problems in the bedroom and ultimately decided against it since my hormones were going to be fiddle with anyways. I was taken off Progesterone completely, and one of my antiandrogens was fully removed, the remaining HRT regimen I was on was literally cut in half in hope of eradicating my faux morning sickness. I was ecstatic about the prospect of this change but unfortunately I was less then ecstatic about the results. I decided to give myself time to grieve my first relationship but also give my body time to adjust to the change. I repeated my actions of my first encounter with my then second partner, again avoiding “going all the way”, I was admittedly scared at this point. What if I did go all the way and still nothing? Would I then have to admit to myself that I’m broken. You’ve probably came to the conclusion that, that was indeed the case. (At least one of us got to come! That after all is the big issue) I very fortunately no longer felt sick, but other than that the only other thing that changed was my skin texture. I experienced for the first time the occasional blemish and random dry spot. That relationship quickly floundered and at this time I was certain my inability to climax was the issue. I very stupidly decided to take matters into my own hands and started playing with the dosage of my HRT to no avail, alas my skin suffered the consequences and my sexual appetite reaped absolutely no reward. I decided to do the only rational thing I could think of, ignore the issue completely. I’m older now and the prospect and fear of being alone if getting more prevalent. A few months ago I started seeing someone, someone I was really hoping to go the distance with. This was the end of a very long dry spell. I finally did it, at the age of twenty one I went “all the way”… and nothing. My partner expressed his disappointment, he had completed the race and was pretty bummed that I hadn’t. I was heartbroken, and well broken-broken? We tried multiple times, eleven or twelve times over the course of three weeks. Always the same result. I came clean to a partner for the first time, I told him that this has been an issue since I started HRT, that I was completely content with pleasing him and it wasn’t anything he was doing.

I’m terrified to be alone and in the state that I’m in I’m unable to participate in an adult relationship. I’ve decided to, at least for the foreseeable future stop HRT.

That was easy, I liked both men and women. Very defined (for me at least). I had always had fantasies with me being a woman, not necessarily sexual fantasies. Just doing normal stuff as a woman. But I had always dismissed these and told myself that they aren’t real because I would have them a lot for like a month, and then it would go away for awhile, sometimes 3 months sometimes a year.

I’m just now accepting the possibility of being trans. I don’t really know what to think. I kind of had an epiphany this morning. I’m going away to college in 2 months (already? I was just a kid a month ago), but I don’t know if I should schedule a therapy appointment again or if I should just wait it out for college? Do I even understand what it means to be trans?

2019-06-28 20:53:10,c6pkg1,0,6,"     So, I'm 16 and last summer I began to question if I was trans. It felt so scary to think about back then, but I don't think I fear it anymore, and that's because I recently began to start to look at things from a different perspective.

     My first step was realizing the difference between sex and gender, which I didn't understand at all at the beginning of my journey. However, I eventually realized that yes, ones body is separate from ones mind. I realized this, internalized it, and then had a better understanding of gender 

     My next and final step was actually a couple weeks ago when I had a realization that changed everything. You see, I had decided by the end of last summer that I was not trans. It was a painful thing to constantly question if I was or wasn't, and I eventually decided that I must not be trans, and that I must not be a girl. I don't think I was ever fully satisfied with this conclusion though. I don't think I was ever fully happy with this because I think some of my feelings of wanting to be a girl may have actually been real, but just that they weren't strong enough to make me want to change how I identified.

     Very recently, I had a realization. Whenever someone would say that gender is a social construct, I simply wouldn't understand them, I just couldn't understand where they were coming from, but now, I think I do. I now understand that my brain, my conciousness is not male, it's not female, it's not objectively anything really. It simply is as it is. The universe does not care how I think of myself, it'll just continue doing what it's doing, it'll keep my brain structurally the same as it's always been.

     When I realized this, everything changed. I realize now that I can both occasionally want to be a girl, and also not be a girl at the same time, because in reality I'm not any of these labels at all, I simply am how I am.

     I would also like to say that I'm not trying to convince anyone who reads this to feel different about how they identify or anything, I respect how everyone identifies, and even though I have come to this realization I still in the end identify as male myself. I simply wanted to share my story here, as this final realization has truly changed me, and I think given me the amount of closure I needed. Good luck everybody with your transitioning and just living as a trans person in general, I am thankful that even though I have these feelings, I don't have a need to transition, and I know that it must be tough for anybody who DOES truly suffer living in the wrong body.

How can I let her down easy without breaking her heart? 

Or should I just forget about it and try to date her? I enjoy our conversations and also I’m incredibly attracted to her body and face.

""Am I trans even if some days I feel feminine?""
Yes, you are. No one has to constantly be masculine or feminine. You don't owe anyone conformity. You don't have to buy in to the mannerisms of a useless binary.

""Am I trans even if my birth name feels as valid as my chosen name?""
Yes. Names never meant much to you, anyway. Out of all the words you've identified with in your life, in your writing, in your heart, why do you have to pick one now? You do not.

""Am I trans even if I can't imagine myself on T? Getting surgery? Physically transitioning?""
Yes, for the same reason you are still trans on feminine days. Just because you are comfortable in your body, most days, does not mean you are fake. You should be proud and happy with the fact that you are, at least, comfortable with a vagina. 

I am trans. I am a boy. I am both Andrew and Alyssa. Even if I don't mind being clocked as female. Even if I never look masculine a day in my life.

2019-06-30 04:36:09,c7945y,4,22,"A year ago today, I decided to transition.

Last year, the evening before Chicago Pride, I knew that I couldn’t keep it in any longer. 

In a cheap amazon shirt and some poorly done make up, staring at the image of a chubby, beard shadowed man - I confronted a painful truth: relegating myself to the stuffy, picket-fence life that I had begun to build for myself would always be a gilded cage, that keeping my true self locked away in a chest of women’s clothing in the back of my closet would slowly eat away at me for as long as I lived.

It was the night that I decided that there was a better way. A truer way. A way that I could live with. A future that I could actually look forward to. 

I set a modest goal: by Pride 2019 I would come out to just one of my closest friends. 

Here I am. One year later. The eve of Chicago Pride. Full time. Legally and socially living my true self. 

In the interim has been what was indisputably the hardest, scariest, most difficult year of my life. There were MONTHS where I told myself “just make it to the end of one. more. day.” Days where I had to fight the thoughts telling me it was too much to overcome, too difficult to triumph over. 

I’ve had to battle demons in my own mind. The demons of internalized transphobia. The demons of internalized sexism. The demons of internalized shame. 

I’ve had to fight to make my space. Throwing elbows and asserting myself in a way that I’ve never had to before. I’ve had to seriously hurt people that I love to do it. I’ve had to sacrifice relationships with family and a partner whom I loved dearly.

I’ve had to face my fears on a daily basis. The fears of discrimination, of abuse, of abandonment. I’ve had to face the reality of all three as well. 

But I overcame. I triumphed. I fought and I fought and I wanted to quit but I never did. And now I’m me.

For the first time in my 26 years on planet Earth I AM ALIVE.

I’m in a life that I own. With a *name* that I own. Bit by bit I’m beginning to finally identify my BODY as my own. 

If me one year ago could see a glimpse of the life that I have built for myself today I would be in complete and utter disbelief. It was *unfathomable* to me a year ago. 

I felt inspired to put these words down tonight, for myself, but also for those of you in the shoes that I was in on this night last year in the hopes that my story may resonate within you.

A truer way. A way that I could live with. A future that I could actually look forward to. \n\nI set a modest goal: by Pride 2019 I would come out to just one of my closest friends. \n\nHere I am. One year later. The eve of Chicago Pride. Full time. Legally and socially living my true self. \n\nIn the interim has been what was indisputably the hardest, scariest, most difficult year of my life. There were MONTHS where I told myself “just make it to the end of one. more. day.” Days where I had to fight the thoughts telling me it was too much to overcome, too difficult to triumph over. \n\nI’ve had to battle demons in my own mind. The demons of internalized transphobia. The demons of internalized sexism. The demons of internalized shame. \n\nI’ve had to fight to make my space. Throwing elbows and asserting myself in a way that I’ve never had to before. I’ve had to seriously hurt people that I love to do it. I’ve had to sacrifice relationships with family and a partner whom I loved dearly.\n\nI’ve had to face my fears on a daily basis. The fears of discrimination, of abuse, of abandonment. I’ve had to face the reality of all three as well. \n\nBut I overcame. I triumphed. I fought and I fought and I wanted to quit but I never did. And now I’m me.\n\nFor the first time in my 26 years on planet Earth I AM ALIVE.\n\nI’m in a life that I own. With a *name* that I own. Bit by bit I’m beginning to finally identify my BODY as my own. \n\nIf me one year ago could see a glimpse of the life that I have built for myself today I would be in complete and utter disbelief. It was *unfathomable* to me a year ago. \n\nI felt inspired to put these words down tonight, for myself, but also for those of you in the shoes that I was in on this night last year in the hopes that my story may resonate within you. \n\nTHIS COMMUNITY, both on Reddit and out in my real world community SAVED MY LIFE. \n\nI love you all - happy pride!\n\n❤️🧡💛💚💙💜', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'A year ago today, I decided to transition...', 'created': 1561894569.0}"

2019-06-30 05:56:00,c79s56,1,11,"For the sake of political correctness, I would like to speak of this story from the possibility that the person who this is to, may be trans. It's something that I was not aware of at the time, and rather tried to avoid. For most of this confession, I'm putting myself in my shoes back at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline: This was around 2010-2011, where the LGBT really started the beginning stages of being accepted at schools, but before the Q was officially added I believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Premise: I grew up being called gay by bullies and the likes most of my childhood, because I wasn't as inherently masculine as the other boys. This was before I even understood sexuality. But nonetheless, being called all kinds of stuff put me in a very repressed mindset, and I projected a lot following middle school, and into high school. 

Situation: There was this schoolmate in high school and I saw them on occasion in the hallway. I went to a performing arts high school, so it was way further ahead in terms. of LGBTQ acceptance. So me being willfully detached from identity, I assumed they were a cis boy, but gay. But one day, they came in dressed up. A simple black dress, heels, but no detailed or heavy  makeup look. I believe they had light nude lipstick on, and earrings.  They were sitting with their cis female friend. And our school was accepting of people but that was still a foreign concept. Now looking back, I don't know if they were crossdressing, or if they were trans. I simply didn't know. But still.. I saw them. It caught me off guard. They were sitting with their Cis girl friend in the spot they always did before school started for the day. People would walk by and comment but not at them, just with their own friends but it was loud enough for both of them to hear. Most of it was mocking to varying extents. I could tell they were starting to feel uncomfortable, and their cis girl friend was drawing their attention back to her so they wouldn't have a panic attack. Cis girl friend directed her friends eyes back to hers, to focus. But their eyes wandered and hit my direction. And I just stared. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to add, I naturally have a resting bitch face that I cant help. And I think it came off intimidating at the time. Because at the time I'm a black AMAB and I dressed hella masculine at the time and projected such. I always projected anger, or hype bro energy to keep from being angry. But the stare wasn't intended to be a bad thing. I was just attracted to them. Like I'm pretty sure my egg cracked at that moment. There were several times it could've cracked growing up, but mix being just a young kid, and later being a repressed teen, I swept that all under the rug.  Back to this individual. They were fucking gorgeous. I felt all kinds of shit. The kind of stuff I would feel about cis women at the time, when I had a crush. The heart fluttering. Dry mouth because I was nervous. It was a legitimate off-guard moment, and I let it down, and only the surface of what I was feeling could show. I was confused, and in that moment, all kinds of shit started flowing back:

\- The time I wanted to be Sailor Moon for Halloween and my bio-dad called me a faggot and forced me to be Ghostface instead. Jealous of all my female classmates. 

\- The time I asked for more pink and lighter colored t-shirts, and the authority figures in my life telling me I don't want that.

\- And all the times I was called gay or sissy in middle school. Every day. Before I even expressed sexuality..

&amp;#x200B;

All of it came back. I don't know how long I stared but they both eventually just started and got up and walked away. Me staring and the looks other people gave was most likely too much. All I could do was. stare, and when I really came back to, my friends nearby were laughing, about what they saw. I didn't talk to them much the whole day, but I had to revert back to hiding it all. It took a few days to put all of it back in so I could go back to being a toxic trash bin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2014. 3 years after. we graduated; When I officially could not hold much of it in anymore without experimenting and alleviating some of the dysphoria. It all came back to me, after not thinking about it for years. One of my best friends, a cis female, was open about it. She was the first person I told everything to. And she never judged me. Amongst several other things over the course of days after coming out to her,  I thought I was just telling a basic ass account of high school life but I was drunk as fuck and cried my eyes out about it because I realized how hurtful even just a STARE can be. I felt like shit. They probably didn't know that I wished I was their friend that they came out to, or just a friend in general.  I can't find them. Not on facebook, not in my yearbook, nothing. Nowhere.  
I knew their name at the time, but I can't find a trace and it fucks with me because sometimes it feels like they weren't really there, but I know that's not the case. I just have to keep searching. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to this person, in the very small off chance that you're in this subreddit, and you can put all these pieces together:

**I am truly sorry. I wish I was as brave as you at the time. I still wish I was. I'm not there yet. But I could've been there for you. Even if I used my masculinity at the time to make sure no one fucked with you. You were so beautiful. You had a smile that I hadn't previously seen on you all the times I walked past you and your friends' chilling spot before school.** 

**I wish I could've encouraged you or complimented you. I wish I could've asked you out.. I wish I could've just been there, even as a friend. I wish you could've taught me about identity sooner. I wish I knew I was going to crack like this. I wish I wasn't so afraid of my family and friends, and the repercussions of coming out in my situation. I don't know if you've been through family abuse. But I should've risked mine to let you know you're not alone. The one time I stare without speaking my mind, was the worst time to not do so. You played a part in me finding myself. If you see this, I hope you know that, and I hope you can forgive me.**

Would you call gender dysphoria an illness? Mental or physical.

From what I have read it seems like it has to do with hormon issues during the pregnancy.

If there were a treatment to get rid of the dysphoria without any side effects , would you?

I'll call them Tee. We constantly had sleepovers and I went to church with Tee almost every Sunday, including mutual and Girl's Camp(church related camp for young women). 

We had a great relationship until I came out to Tee as bisexual in my junior year of high school. 

After that the sleepovers stopped and we became less close. It really hurt me because I thought they would be excepting.  

I got into a serious relationship with a male soon after and about a year later at 17, I moved in with him. (My family was displaced and living with my grandparents, my mom allowed me to live with him with contingencies) He had talked about marrying me and he was my first great love. Then he allowed his best friend to move in. His best friend happened to be my date rapist. I told him this and he didn't believe me. I stupidly stayed with him as he promised nothing would happen. His friend however got angry with me all the time and ended up getting in my face violently yelling. My boyfriend was right there and did nothing. That's when I finally left. 

Not even two weeks later I am going to senior grad night and I see Tee getting out of my ex's car. I was hurt to say the least, Tee and I weren't close but they did know about what had happened with my ex, and why I left. I confronted Tee and they claimed it was nothing.

We have been lightly talking when Tee said they were depressed so I wanted to help as much as I could. We talked almost every day. Only a few weeks later they came out as transgender female to male. After that Tee hasn't talked to me. 

I really want to stay in touch and become friends again but I'm not sure if I should reach out again or how.

We have been lightly talking when Tee said they were depressed so I wanted to help as much as I could. We talked almost every day. Only a few weeks later they came out as transgender female to male. After that Tee hasn't talked to me. \n\nI really want to stay in touch and become friends again but I'm not sure if I should reach out again or how. I'm also having a hard time navigating through pronouns and the name change and my own feelings. I feel selfish to have any feelings about it at all but all of our friendship Tee was a she, now that he's a he I feel more hurt that they distanced themselves after I came out. I want to make clear I am in full support of anyone in the LGBT community. \n\n I honestly am looking for advice on how to show I'm supportive. And also how to deal with my feelings. Any advice would be great. Thank you in advance."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My Estranged Bestie Came Out As Trans', 'created': 1561925951.0}"

/////////
Verse 1
/////////

Mommy’s touch, first contact with the world. Pure of heart from the start, I was an innocent baby girl.

My little baby eyes were closed, completely free of judgement. Wrapped around my mothers arms, I truly know I am human.

A single tear of happiness, rolls down her pretty cheek.
She worked so hard, and now she’s feeling weak

After all this pain, and after all this joy.
Congratulations, it’s a beautiful baby boy.

A gentle kiss now, this must be from daddy. “Oh my beautiful son, I’ll promise, to keep you healthy”.

“You’ll have a courageous heart, The will to face your fears. And to little baby me, this was gibberish to my ears.

“We’ll get him toys, paint his room blue. And we’ll even have to tie his shoes.”

And little me, couldn’t even confess.
That daddy I’m not like the rest.

////////////
Chorus:
////////////

Couldn’t try or even talk.
To explain the nature of my heart 
I can’t speak, Or can’t express.
The pain that would make my life a mess
A heart of gold, so i’ve been told. 
A boy that doesn’t quite fit the mold
***
So i’ve been told

\\\\\\\\\\\\
Verse 2
////////////

Baby girl now six years old, at school where she’s enrolled.

She got picked on by other boys, for playing with girly toys.

Feeling hurt deep down inside, cause she hates having to hide.

Her true self feeling ashamed, about saying her own damn name.

Hating her boyish clothes, uncomfortable I suppose

Just wanting to wear a dress, without no one to impress.

Little me, couldn’t understand.
Trying to find who I really am

A boy who’ll love, a boy who’ll cry.
A girl who’s life would be all lies.

***
To hide...

////////////
Chorus:
////////////

Couldn’t try or even talk.
To explain the nature of my heart 
I can’t speak, Or can’t express.
The pain that would make my life a mess
A heart of gold, so i’ve been told. 
A boy that doesn’t quite fit the mold
***
So i’ve been told

////////////
Verse 3
///////////

Little girl now all grown up, still playing with her makeup.

Still unsure of this whole mess, still envious of her mom’s dress.

No she doesn’t have a clue, No one told her what to do.

To fix her fucking brain, to no longer feel pain.

All she wants is to feel love, for the life she keeps dreaming of.

Mom and dad don’t be ashamed, for something I overcame

It’s my life i’m fighting for, all the signs I can’t ignore.
...

\\\\\\\\\\\
Bridge:
///////////

Please just listen to what I’m saying
Even if at first glance, it sounds insane
Who I am inside my brain
Doesn’t really fit my name
I’m completely done, playing these games
Hey dad i’ve got something to explain

////////////
Chorus:
////////////

Now when I try to talk.
To explain the nature of my heart 
I can speak, I can express.
I went and bought myself a dress.
My heart of gold so i’ve been told,
A girl that doesn’t quite fit the mold
...
So i’ve been told.

Do you have things that you sometimes crave and feel amazing physically, but always end up being triggering? For me, it’s being penetrated. Sometimes I just really crave it and want it, I’m not sure why, it never ends well. I haven’t been sexually active for too long, my dysphoria and other issues prevented me from perusing a sexual relationship with a woman for a long time. I never asked my previous gf to penetrate me, infact it was a hard boundary for me. My new gf is amazing and sex with her is out of this world, so I thought I’d give it a try. I have penetrated myself with toys during masturbation, and while it was mildly triggering I figured doing it with my gf might somehow be different? 

It was different. It was worse. But then in someways better.


We have a strap on and a couple dildos to go with it, very rarely used as she doesn’t really love being penetrated either. very occasionally she’ll ask for the smallest one we have and grind on it on me, but that’s rare, if she wants to grind she usually just straddles me and grinds her clit on my dick. Which is not really relevant to this, I’m just stalling...
 

Anyway, I asked her to use the strap on (and medium sized dildo) on me a few nights ago. I was just really craving it. She did, she was gentle and sweet until I asked for it less gentle and less sweet. She worked my dick with her hand while she fucked me, and during the experience everything was fine. It felt amazing, and I had and incredible orgasm. Typically during masturbation where I penetrate myself this is where I start to come down and get all kinds of negative feelings. This time was no different. I didn’t want to seem ‘weak’ so I tried to push through, I asked if I could use the strap on on her, she said yes.

This is where I feel like a huge asshole. She was so gentle and sweet when she started with me, I was less so. Maybe in my head I thought I could prove I was man enough for her if I fucked her hard enough. She took it for a bit, and then asked me to stop and told me I was hurting her. I felt terrible. It all came crashing in, the shame of getting off while being penetrated/fucked by her. And then not even being able to do her right. 

I pretty much lost it, I wound up crying/bawling myself to sleep. She was really sweet, held and tried to comfort me. Which itself was a bit of a mind fuck. It was nice being in her arms but didn’t exactly help me feel manly (I know there isn’t anything wrong with crying, but in that moment it was hard) 

We had a good talk the morning after, I explained my feeling about everything that happened, she listened and accepted my apology for the way I behaved when I hurt her. She was really understanding and were still in a good place. This feels like something I should talk to my therapist about, and I will. I just find it weird that I crave it occasionally, love it during the act but then feel nothing but shame and regret afterwards.

Anyone else have things the crave and enjoy in the moment but trigger you?",trans,Sex and dysphoria.,1561962269.0,"{'created_utc': 1561937069, 'id': 'c7l4j9', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 0, 'selftext': '31ftm has simple meta a few years ago, kept vaginal canal.\n\nDo you have things that you sometimes crave and feel amazing physically, but always end up being triggering?
