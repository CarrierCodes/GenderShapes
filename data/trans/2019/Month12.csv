2019-12-01 00:38:19,e46l4v,13,1,"I (31 yo AMAB transwoman) have been dating this girl I met in July since August of this year and at first things were great. We met on FB and talked every day, sometimes for hours. She even drove 2000+ miles to spend 5 days with me in October. It was amazing and we have such an amazing connection. I seriously love this girl so much. 

Lately, though,communication is breaking down. We no longer have those long 3-4 hour conversations that we used to have. I can't even keep her on the phone for 20 minutes now. I text her a thoughtful little good morning note every day and sometimes don't hear back at all until the afternoon or evening. 

Maybe I'm expecting too much, I don't know. I just really want to talk to her and I don't understand why she won't. I don't even expect her to call every day but at least once a week. Is that too much to ask? Am I wasting my time? I even had a serious talk with her about this. I told her I'm not trying to monopolize her time but I need more from her to continue this relationship. She cried and agreed she hasn't been communicating as well as she could have been. I respect her needing alone time too, we all need it sometimes. Maybe I'm crazy but I feel like if you're gonna date someone you should make an effort to actually talk to them once in a while.

My last relationship fell apart after 13 years because I came out as transgender. She stole half of my stuff and ghosted me. After 13 years of a loving, adoring relationship I was just dropped like I had the plague. My parents have not been good about my transition either and have always been cold to me. I feel like people just get tired of me and abandon me. Am I impossible to love? What is wrong with me?

So now I'm sitting here crying because for all the other shit I finally got figured out in my life, I still have a massive void in my heart. I feel like I'm just better off alone. I feel like I'm not worth anyone's time. At least I have a job I love and some good friends but I'm afraid to talk to anyone about my problems because they'll just think I'm being a drag. 

Why is it so hard to find someone that wants to just spend some time together? I guess I'm just fucking useless. I guess I'm just a convenience for someone.

I don’t know if I’m allowed to post here because I’m not trans, but it seemed like the bra themed subreddits were sexual rather than practical and I figured you all would have the most useful advice

I’ve been really wanting some well made bras that hide my breasts or at least minimize them a cup size or two. I have GERD and panic attacks so binders aren’t a good idea I think with my regular chest pains, and doubling up on sports bras doesn’t do anything except make me feel bogged down and swampy.

2019-12-01 04:35:32,e4ajlu,0,1,"Who am I? This is a question I’ve been asking myself for the past week. I was a narcissistic child who never considered the opinions of others to be relevant and who had severe “immortality syndrome.” I never fit in with anyone as much as I tried (I would wear skirts to try to fit in with the girls and cargo shorts for the boys but no one ever took to me). Always felt uncomfortable in my body. Even at peak physical fitness when I would go to both swim and ballet practice every single day, I didn’t like myself, never had an actual friend, never compared myself with others, and have thus no way of going back and understanding my perceived perfection. In 7th/8th grade I began to dress more masculine, still feeling both uncomfortable in my own skin and perfect to others at the same time. I was depressed and anxious but I didn’t know why. I self-harmed for both 7th and 8th grade by scratching my skin off. I didn’t know why I was excluded by others. “I am perfect. Right? It’s their fault I’m excluded. They’re in the wrong.” I never considered myself wrong in any way and nothing could change that in my mind. 

In 9th/10th grade I became a vessel of school - obsessed with grades, perfection, and competition. Never once questioned or considered my gender. I just chugged along, complacent and uncomfortable and distracted by the never-ending workload and competition of high school. I limited my personal expression to school and only school. Now it is the 11th year. The 11th hour. The final year before my inevitable señoritis consumes me. But I sit here with something else on my mind. Something that strays from the perceived perfection I have experienced for the past 16 years. Something that even the mere consideration of has shaken me to my core. With my care for school and the iron grip it has held on my psyche dwindling, my mind has had the room to explore its own depths. I sit in self-reflection of that unknowing, frustrated, and narcissistic child. That child who spoke to many but never once had a friend. Who never compared because there’s no way I could be anything but perfect, right? Sure I couldn’t make small talk, understand the intricacies of why the people around me act the way they do, but I have a 4.0, right? I’m resilient and knowledgeable about a vast array of topics from Proto-Indoeuropean to the plight of the Himalayan sherpas, and therefore I am perfect right? My teachers like me, I have never been averse to stereotypically feminine things as a child so I am perfect right? Wrong. 

Here I sit. On the first break from school I’ve had in four years, from summer school to homework over break to studying for the stupid SAT, this week off for thanksgiving is truly the first break Ive had. And my brain wanders. It explores its deepest crevices. That nagging discomfort 
 I’ve always felt but ignored because “that’s vain and stupid and a waste of time that could be spent on school.” But I haven’t stopped thinking. For the entire week I haven’t stopped. Here I sit. Imperfect. I am human and there is a flaw. A nasty, shameful, life-changing, beautiful, puzzle-completing flaw. I question my childhood.

The narcissism of my youth blinded my from considering that maybe that voice in the back of my head and that discomfort I felt when interacting with others did not stem from them not understanding me, but from me not understanding myself. “I am perfection. I cannot have flaws. My discomfort is from others. I am a girl and anything that indicates otherwise is not my problem.” But here I sit. My chest bound.

Anyone able to point me in the right direction so I’m not falling down the wrong rabbit holes as I research this? Any fantastic athletes making claims in this space I should be aware of?

&amp;#x200B;

So for a short backstory. I am representing fully 24/7 for about 10 month now, mtf. Recently I started on training my voice, so it is all over the place at the moment, pitch, resonance, melody, all that. I work at a small business, 3-4 people and my boss has been accepting so far and is relatively good with my new name. I am pre-everything, but might hopefully get on hrt in the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

So up to the vent. It was friday, I was packing my things to leave work and my boss is back from a recent project. So it was about a week we have not seen each other (we do not have a very good relationship at the moment, but this involves other things.)

&amp;#x200B;

So I was about to leave and her stops me. ""Can I tell you something personal?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure."" I said.

&amp;#x200B;

""About your voice, what you try just does not sound feminine at all, and I know many women, it rather sounds like a fag.""

&amp;#x200B;

Well ok, then thanks, wtf? Given I ventured a little high in the pitch and overused melody. Valid point, but a bit off putting to say it like that and use that word.

&amp;#x200B;

""I mean, I came back to this and even other people are talking about that. And I have to supress my laughter everytime i hear you speak like that. No woman is talking like that, and I don't know how you got the idea.""

&amp;#x200B;

I try to explain that my voice it all over the place at the moment, and I am trying to find the right spot, which takes a lot of time and practice.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, I know it can not go fast enough for you, but give yourself a bit of time, maybe just work at the pitch and resonance and leave the melody out at first. And I don't know what your therapist says about that or your voice trainer (I have none, as I would need a diagnosis to start it and for the insurance to pay for it.), and maybe your friends won't tell you for obvious reasons beeing your friends. But I just had to say something.""

&amp;#x200B;

""So what do you want me to do?"" lowering my voice to my male range. ""Talk like that and answer the phone with my female name.""

&amp;#x200B;

""No, just give yourself the time you need. Otherwise people might be put off and do not want have anything to do with you in time, because of the way you sound like. And I want to like to come to the office, not dreading it, thinking about the situation here.""

&amp;#x200B;

I really did not know how to respond, try to explain myself (I already took the blame to my heart and tried to please him - I do not really like confrontations and am a bit of a pushover, apologizing for things)

&amp;#x200B;

""And you know, as I was away on the project, everyone kept asking about you and your transition and I had to explain it. After a time i really got on my nerves, so I did not want to constantly explain it. Interestingly, the second question was always how I feel with this situation too. (Sidenote, he told me that it is not easy to handle all of this and basically to be thankful that he handles my transition so well, even it is not easy for everybody involved - Basically I thought, wtf is the problem for you here, respecting me as a human beeing and treating me this way? Does he want to have some brownie points for that?).""

&amp;#x200B;

""So, maybe give yourself the time. Mind, Body and Soul, to get everything right. Because I want this to work and and I want to support and push your transition. (Not what he said, but what it sounded like: But I need to be comfortable with it, and it should not affect our work (the work thing, he told me before).)""

&amp;#x200B;

""Just take this with you and do or do not do anything you want with that.""

&amp;#x200B;

And there I was, thinking about it all weekend long, feeling pretty shitty and drinking to much wine and dreading the days to come.

Clutching the 4s I responded ""I think I'll go with these"". ""Awesome"" she exclaimed ""I can take the others for you."" As I turned walk off she said ""I can ring those up for you right over here if you'd like""  I know she must have known I was nervous to have yet another interaction.  

She rang me up and bagged up my jeans and off I went.

As I walked out she asked ""so, what do you think?"" Clutching the 4s I responded ""I think I\'ll go with these"". ""Awesome"" she exclaimed ""I can take the others for you."" As I turned walk off she said ""I can ring those up for you right over here if you\'d like""  I know she must have known I was nervous to have yet another interaction.  \n\nShe rang me up and bagged up my jeans and off I went.  \n\nThis may seem silly to some but this was such a huge step for me that I broke down into tears when I got in my car.

Sorry this might be a bit long... 

I need some advice....I’m travelling with some work friends next year for a work event and they don’t know that I’m trans (I’m working on it). I recently moved to a new city and have made some cool friends — all of which are guys. For once in my life I actually have friends (have always struggled with maintaining friendships) and they don’t treat me differently or think of me differently because I’m trans. I’m just one of the guys to them... and I like it (they’re not brutes btw, just decent hard working men) but I don’t know how they’ll react and I don’t have the courage right now to be out as trans. I know it’s nothing to be ashamed of, all my family and everyone back home knows but I still have A LOT of dysmorphia and trouble coming out to each individual person and the fear of how new people I meet will react when they find out. The only people that know are the folks in HR. 

I’m on T, I’ve had top surgery and I pass really well imo (probs bc I’m 6ft and have mad facial hair) but my passport is still female and my name hasn’t changed on there. I don’t rly have the funds as of right now to do all that whilst I still sort out my other debts, that was kinda something I was waiting to do. But this work event is coming up and I’m going with all the guys, I haven’t travelled since I was 10 and I am now 26- I can’t remember what happens. 

My name is still very stereotypically female and surely they’ll see on the boarding pass or when I’m greeted / checking in... do they do that? Like call me by the name on my passport? Is it a possibility that I can get to the airport early and check in myself and just discreetly get my pass and go through security alone (they’ll give me a female agent, right?) so I’m just ready to get on the plane.

I need to hear your real life experiences with top surgery, about cost, and how it turned out, and where you went for this, what kind of insurance is good for this, and I need critique


December 2019, I am 15 years old

Right now, my ribs are fucked up, so I plan to live in my gigantic ass hoodie all year trying to bind as little as possible so I can get top surgery, I will refuse gym and swim until my last year, where I will swallow up those credits so I can graduate without broken ribs or punctured lungs, thus being said, I'll try and work harder for grades

I will save up as much money as possible, the highest I've gotten so far was 500 dollars, but thus will be way more, like fuckin quadruple that, Right now I'm saveing for plane tickets to Thailand so I can get the Top surgery I want, at Kamol hospital, unless I find a better closer option to Indiana, and I will not be going to College until I get top surgery

Prices
Plane tickets: I want to get two one way tickets because I actually have no idea how long I'll need to be there during the process, and how long I'll need to recover afterwards

Prices I've been looking at, the cheapest and best option, I've found a ticket with a price estimate of 812 dollars, which will most likely change in the future, I'll need two tickets however, so around 1600 dollars, I know this is a lot but I don't realistically believe I'll get that money on 4 years, I'll talk about that later 

The surgery
It can cost any where from 3500 to 9000 dollars without insurance 
Not much to say about this, but it's scary

Renting a room in Thailand aswell as everyday living
Definitely the least expensive thing right now rangeing from 33 dollars to 120, I'll save up as much As I can for multiple nights, but I also want income to come in while I'm there, maybe commissions, or maybe I have an at home job, I would really like someone to come with me for moral support...I'll really need it, pre surgery depression is a bitch from what I've heard",trans,People who had top surgery-,1575362694.0,"{'created_utc': 1575337494, 'id': 'e59ia3', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""\nI need to hear your real life experiences with top surgery, about cost, and how it turned out, and where you went for this, what kind of insurance is good for this, and I need critique\n\n\nDecember 2019, I am 15 years old\n\nRight now, my ribs are fucked up, so I plan to live in my gigantic ass hoodie all year trying to bind as little as possible so I can get top surgery, I will refuse gym and swim until my last year, where I will swallow up those credits so I can graduate without broken ribs or punctured lungs, thus being said, I'll try and work harder for grades\n\nI will save up as much money as possible, the highest I've gotten so far was 500 dollars, but thus will be way more, like fuckin quadruple that, Right now I'm saveing for plane tickets to Thailand so I can get the Top surgery I want, at Kamol hospital, unless I find a better closer option to Indiana, and I will not be going to College until I get top surgery\n\nPrices\nPlane tickets: I want to get two one way tickets because I actually have no idea how long I'll need to be there during the process, and how long I'll need to recover afterwards\n\nPrices I've been looking at, the cheapest and best option, I've found a ticket with a price estimate of 812 dollars, which will most likely change in the future, I'll need two tickets however, so around 1600 dollars, I know this is a lot but I don't realistically believe I'll get that money on 4 years, I'll talk about that later \n\nThe surgery\nIt can cost any where from 3500 to 9000 dollars without insurance \nNot much to say about this, but it's scary\n\nRenting a room in Thailand aswell as everyday living\nDefinitely the least expensive thing right now rangeing from 33 dollars to 120, I'll save up as much As I can for multiple nights, but I also want income to come in while I'm there, maybe commissions, or maybe I have an at home job, I would really like someone to come with me for moral support...I'll really need it, pre surgery depression is a bitch from what I've heard"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'People who had top surgery-', 'created': 1575362694.0}"

2019-12-03 05:06:15,e5c1qm,9,1,"How tf am I? [HELP]

I don't know if I'm a guy, girl, non binary or what.
I could use a little help.

So basically I'm a 16 year old AMAB (assigned male at birth), and for the past 1.5+ years I've been questioning my gender identity. And it's hella weird cuz one one side I would love to be a girl, but I don't feel like a girl at all (I don't know how I feel like). On the other side, I'm slightly uncomfortable presenting as a guy, but not fully, like it sometimes bothers me, but I'm not sure if it's presenting like a guy, or having to follow society's expectations of a guy, of some self esteem issues I have with myself. Idk.

But I constantly fantasize with being a woman, about having hips, breasts, vagina, feminine clothes, etc. And ever since I started having sexual thoughts (about when I was 12 or maybe younger) I'd imagine myself as a woman and I pretty much loved it. But on other fantasies, I'd imagine myself as a guy, and it didn't bothered me at all, so it's really confusing. Also, I don't remember feeling uncomfortable presenting as a boy when I was a kid, I think being a boy fitted me pretty well, I played mostly with other boys in kindergarten &amp; primary, and did all the stereotypical things boys do. It was until I hit puberty when I think I started having thoughts about being a girl (I'm realizing I've been questioning my gender identity for more time I thought I was, lmao) but I buried the idea of being trans cuz I was a kid who was thought by their dad that being gay or trans was bad, (I'm bisexual btw). It was until I accepted by bisexuality and came out to me friends, when the thought of being trans re-entered my head.

Adding more to my confusion, when I get called female pronouns by accident I feel so happy, like it feels really good, so that led me to think I was actually a trans woman. But when I started using female pronouns to myself, I felt like I was lying me, I don't feel like a woman, but think I'd love to be one. On the other side, when I use male pronouns to myself, I don't feel like I'm lying to me, but it feels slightly uncomfortable.

The last thing is, that I don't always feel uncomfortable with the idea of me being a guy (I sometimes even like it), but I never feel uncomfortable with the idea of being a girl. Does that makes me non-binary???

At this point I don't know how to feel, I'm confused, and desperate, so if you have any thoughts or advices or pretty much anything, let me know please.

When I was around 21 (I'm 25 now) I went to the family doctor that we had to use because we didn't have insurance at the time. My main reason was going to ask for anxiety/depression medication, but the fact that I was trans was also brought up.

Basically the entire time after that, he tried to tell me how expensive it would be, and how people he knew had not become any happier after transitioning. I had been scared to talk about my anxiety/depression, much less being trans. But I thought, he's a doctor, maybe he can help? 

Not only did he seem to be trying to pass off my anxiety/depression, he made me feel like he was trying to persuade me not to transition. 
I had started crying not just because of my anxiety, but because he brought up fears I already had about money and I was starting to think I would never be able to transition if it costs so much. 

Thankfully, my mom was with me and could tell I was actually upset, so she tried to tell him how important it was to me and move the converstation onward.

2019-12-04 04:58:22,e5u4r9,4,1,"Getting some conflicting answers from Googling this question. Hoping y'all can help me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm early in transition (male to female), and I have to shave my face every morning because my beard grows in quickly (dark and visible within a day, and hard to disguise with makeup). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just had my first of 6 planned laser sessions at New Look Skin Center in Glendale, CA. It went well, but the technician told me afterward that I would have to wait two weeks - though \*three\* would be ideal - before I could shave again.  

&amp;#x200B;

This feels like a very tall order for me, but the last thing I'd want to do is screw up and maim my face (or whatever the precise risk is; I have a poor grasp of it). Searching around, I've seen some people say it's actually fine after 3-4 days, while others say 10 days, and some say I'd be fine so long as I use an electric razor (I've previously been using a straight razor exclusively). Confusingly, the printout the clinic gave me on my way out the door says ""shaving is permitted if needed in-between intervals,"" contradicting the technician.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm at a bit of a loss. Has anyone else here been instructed to wait such a long time? If so, did enough hairs fall out in the meantime to make the wait bearable? Is this clinic just playing it exceptionally safe, or should I follow this instruction to the letter, even if it brings me back to a socially-excruciating full-beard situation for a week or two?

The International Olympic Committee — the IOC — recently admitted that it couldn't come up with [fair guidelines](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/ioc-delays-new-transgender-guidelines-2020-olympics) governing how and when ""transgender women"" (that is, men) can [compete as women](https://www.splicetoday.com/sports/the-olympics-transgender-athlete-policy-s-a-mess), against actual women.  Currently, the IOC says a man self-identifying as a woman can compete, so long as his testosterone level remains below 10 nanomoles per liter (nm/L) for 12 months.  Typically, men have between 7.7 and 29.4 nm/L of testosterone, while women have between 0.12 and 1.77 nm/L.  Under those IOC guidelines, hormonally restricted men can still maintain nearly a 500-percent testosterone advantage over women. 

However, the real benefit men calling themselves women experience, according to recent studies by Sweden's [Karolinska Institutet](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/ioc-delays-new-transgender-guidelines-2020-olympics), a leading medical university, is found in their masculine bone structure and upper body strength.  This develops throughout puberty, making current testosterone levels largely insignificant.  These masculine genetic benefits are the very reason for women's athletics.

I'm sorry this is a rambling, disorganized rant but it's so specific I don't know who else would be willing to listen.

Anyway, I do data processing for a university, and that means processing documents like transcripts and matching them with digital stuff like test scores and application data.  One problem that universities have is common to any kind of database: duplicate records.  If we get your data from your SAT score but you used a different email address for your ACT scores, that creates two records and we have to merge them into one record so that you have one record with both scores on it, that sort of stuff.  A big problem we have are twins, because they share so much information so any automated system has a hard time telling them apart.  For instance, if there is a Jaime Lastname and a Jainie Lastname with the same date of birth and they go to the same school, are they twins or is that a typo?  If we merge the twins, that fucks up their records but if we don't and it's a typo then we keep bugging them to send us a transcript we've had for weeks.

Well, as you can imagine, any place where people exist will also have trans people (funny how that works), and any database of names presents a potential problem for trans people whose name might not match what's on their birth certificate.  If your dead name is still on your high school transcript but you applied under your normal name, it can be tricky for the college to match the two.  The problem I encounter a lot is receiving a document that says it's for Person A but has a name that doesn't match our records for Person A, and figuring out which name to put in our records.  The way the database exists, everything is labelled by the legal name.  Marketing emails can be set up to go to a nickname, like ""jenny"" instead of ""jennifer"" but everything official like scholarships or an acceptance letter has to go to ""jennifer"" because that's the legal name.

Current policy is that we can't update the official name without something like a driver license or a passport that shows the name we're going to change it to, even in the case of typos or accidentally submitting a FAFSA with your mom's name.  Whenever I receive a document from a trans kid, obviously I don't want to use their dead name but I have to both make sure that the different name isn't just the name of a twin we didn't know about, and update what we have down for their official name.  I've been trying to make it easier to update people's official names to match their gender identity, but I'm encountering some structural problems.

In one meeting, somebody suggested that we add a flag to the record of all trans kids so that the system can have the dead name listed as official still, but everything else uses the ""nickname"" field where we put their real name.  It took almost five minutes to explain to these people why ""Let's put all the trans people on a list"" isn't a good idea.  The room was also full of people asking why it's a problem in the first place.  ""I mean, it's still their name, right?"" and people saying ""Well why can't they just file the paperwork to legally change their name?"".  Nobody was being outright hateful†, there was just a lot of poor understanding to cut through before we could actually try and solve the problem.

Turns out the solution was to just change the name, because of course it is.  I don't know why it took weeks of emails and months of foot-dragging†† to get there, but it did.

2019-12-05 19:27:35,e6m5mk,1,1,"Heya,

I'm 18 years of age and I'm a pre-e trans woman, and I'm living at home with a ""supportive"" mother and step-father; quotes being that they say they support, however, interactions and communication do not prove such. I asked for their help and support when it comes to life, going to the GP, and so on, but each time it's a ""we'll talk about it"", or ""wait until you leave home and education"".

When we do talk about it I feel like I'm just attacked from both sides, getting nowhere and making me feel worse, as well as comments that sound like they are trying to scare me like 'bricks getting thrown through our windows', 'getting attacked by footballers in the street' or 'fuck up my sibling's minds/they'll get bullied' (They do know, and they do support).

I'm in university, and I currently go by a different name on their systems, and everyone refers to me as ""Nyla"" which is both extremely comforting and warm. I do have two friends who sometimes do, or sometimes don't, and I step them in line sometimes but for now, I don't expect them to suddenly change as they knew me as my dead name for years prior.

I dress up semi-fem, but it's not easy when living at home with parents who don't want you wearing certain clothes, getting your nails painted, ect, but I try to make it work with what I have, most times only cycling between what skinny jeans I have.

As commented above, I haven't yet started taking estrogen or any other supplements, however, I am taking Spironolactone, a T-Blocker, in complete secret, brought off the web. I feel as if it's worth the risk, and it's something I can take and keep discreet. It's currently day 5 taking them and my skin already feels softer and less oily, and just now touched my breasts and wanted to cry as they're soft and tender!!!! Aaaaah!!

Just wanted to get it out there and off my,,, eeee soft chest! I'm rather happy as it's a small step forward, and hopefully, when I leave, I can continue to progress further and further once I'm out of the house.

I cant help but see that there are a lot of people calling themselves trans when they're clearly not. These people take no steps to transition.. they don't try to look feminine or masculine.. they don't try to look like the gender they say they want to be... I met a man who was extremely burly, beard and all and obviously not trying to show any femininely but then said he was female and went to the female restroom. Some of my friends accept that when someone says they're trans they assume they are... I don't agree with that.  I think the trans community needs to show what is not ok, and what is. 
Because these people are making us look like a joke! I put so much effort into my appearance everyday just to try to calm my gender dysphoria. Everyone has their bad days and that's ok.

I met a man who was extremely burly, beard and all and obviously not trying to show any femininely but then said he was female and went to the female restroom. Some of my friends accept that when someone says they're trans they assume they are... I don't agree with that.  I think the trans community needs to show what is not ok, and what is. \nBecause these people are making us look like a joke! I put so much effort into my appearance everyday just to try to calm my gender dysphoria. Everyone has their bad days and that's ok.

Hi people

I realised recently that i realy am trans. MtF. I was not realy femenin nor was i attracted to man. Not that i say you have to be. It was just enough to fool myself my whole life. I was always into GenderTF porn but i told myself its just a fetish. Propably it is  but its also rooted deeper then i thought. I have depression as long as i can think. I am 25 now. And i have no hope of it getting better. But my life is shit in far more ways then that. But it would be a long post. Already posted a lot on suicidewatch about it. I hate my life. Every aspect of my live is fucked. Money, family,friends,job,health. I think i could fix a lot of this stuff. But in the end... Why? I feel like me beeing transgender is the bottleneck. I dont whant to put my energy into anything. 
In the end i will never be happy. Most of you seem to handle it wuite good. And i am happy for you. 
 

But therapy and transitioning are things i just don't whant. I know that what i whant is in the realm of Magic. Nonexistent. 
Doesnt change that i would not settle for less. I am a 2meter gorilla. I know most of you have the mindset everyone can be what they whant and be beutifull. But this is just something that doesnt work for me. I am aware that this might be offending for people. But i have seen people like me transitioning. And when they are happy with it i am happy for them. But it just doesnt appeal to me.

\---------

I am interested in this topic because I am an avid supporter of GLTBQ inclusion, gender diversity recognition and a strong opponent of binary gender categorization. I understand that this new era of openness about identity is a crucial and necessary shift in our culture and that it concerns all of us no matter how we identify on the gender spectrum. 

As cis woman, I have been subject to plenty of man-splaining during the course of my life, and so I understand what it is like to have my voice stolen, even if by well-meaning individuals. It is very important to me that I not perpetuate this colonial dynamic by talking over others who have lived experience. 

My sole claim to personal connection to this topic is that I have had some gender-presentation-related body dysmorphia (which drove me to have breast reduction surgery), however for me to claim true depth of understanding of the trans- journey would be like white men who try to relate to (or silence) people of color by saying they have experienced ""reverse discrimination"". 

My advisor hasn't dissuaded me from pursuing this topic, but he is a known softie and possibly a little out-of-touch. I need to hear from the trans community to ascertain how this lands in you.

2019-12-08 01:33:22,e7n7p8,2,1,"so for context i’m a teen trans girl who has only come out to two people so far. one is my closest guy friend who I’ll call H and the other is one of my closest female friends who i’ll call L.

H is someone who’s been pretty much my best friend for several years. we talk all the time about nearly everything going on in our lives. he doesn’t initiate deep conversations much (mostly because he’s crazy busy usually) but he’s a really good listener and i tell him really private stuff all the time. so naturally once i’d been questioning for close to a year and was almost certain that i was trans, coming out to him first was somewhat of a no-brainer. i came out to him around a month ago, and since then, we’ve used self-destructing messages on an app called telegram in order to talk about anything related to my identity.

L is someone who i don’t talk to a ton outside of school or really “hang out” with and stuff but we talk a good amount during school and we always tend to have very fun, charismatic conversations. although i’d never actually told her any secrets before, she struck me as someone who made me feel very comfortable and safe (plus i’d heard from several other people that she was incredibly trustworthy), so last week i arranged a private conversation with her and came out to her then.

it went amazingly, we both got really emotional and she gave me a ton of support and overall it was a very positive experience, but now a couple days later i’ve run into a bit of an issue.

as i said, we spend a decent amount of time together in school but it’s usually in groups and we don’t tend to go too far below the surface in terms of what we talk about. obviously, it feels a bit pointless if i come out to her, everything goes great, and then we just don’t talk about it anymore, but that seems like it’s what’s going to happen unless i can come up with a solution to this.

since i’ve come out to H, maybe 10% or so of our conversations are related to me and my identity. we talk all the time, so 10% means we’re maybe briefly discussing it 2-3 times per week or potentially a longer and deeper conversation (or just me ranting).

but relative to H, i talk to L a lot less, which means that if i were to abide by this same 10% guideline, we’d almost never end up actually talking about my identity, for which i really need as much support as i can get because i’m hoping to come out publicly sometime in april and so far i’m only out to 2 people.

also, when i was coming out to L, i mentioned that i’d been afraid of what might happen to my fun, lighthearted friendship with her if i brought deep stuff into it, and basically this whole discussion ensued where we agreed that we wanted to start becoming closer with each other. i’d been hoping for this to happen because i just really enjoy spending time with her and talking to her, and also because i sorta relate to her more now that i internally identify as female.

so then that brings the question—how am i supposed to do this? how do i gradually start talking to L more and more, which would in turn allow me to talk with her about my identity more and still manage to keep balance in our conversations? (feeling like i’m able to talk about it when i need, but most conversations still being about other things)

i also don’t have any actual means of talking to her about it other than pulling her aside and saying something irl. i really dislike texting about this because it doesn’t feel private (i’m always afraid of someone else seeing a notification or whatever) so the most ideal scenario would be for her to get telegram (the app i use with H) and use the self-destructing messages there. however i had a couple of other friends get telegram over the summer for a different purpose and none of them use it anymore, but basically telegram sends a notification to everyone in your contacts who has it when you get telegram. and sending a notification to like 8 people saying “L just downloaded telegram!” isn’t exactly ideal for keeping this on the down-low (i mentioned that to her when i came out).

i mean i guess i could find a different app with lots of privacy stuff but i still don’t think that solves the main issue. i considered WhatsApp (which i have), but given that it’s owned by facebook i’m not sure how private it actually is. i also mentioned that to L when we were talking last week as a potential option for communication about this but so far she hasn’t gotten it and i don’t wanna nag her by being like “hey pls get this app so i can pester you all the time about the fact that i’m trans.”

again though, that still doesn’t really solve the issue because frankly she and i just don’t talk enough and i’m not sure how to deal with that. we have maybe 10 text conversations over the past year but they’re mostly just short things and not actual substantive conversations. and again we do talk irl but not a ton and it’s usually not just us (there’s another girl called M who L is basically best friends with and i’ve had a rocky relationship with M in the past so being around both of them together is always a little tense).

i just feel really awkward with the fact that i made such a huge deal about this all and how much i trusted her and everything and now it feels like nothing’s gonna be any different because of the fact that we don’t talk often enough. how do i solve this?

**TLDR: i came out as trans to my friend L last week (she’s the second person i’m out to so she’s one of my only allies) and things went really well but now i’ve encountered a problem. we talk a good amount but not a ton and it’s usually in groups, plus not much texting or hanging out outside of school. even though when i came out we agreed that we wanted to start becoming closer, i feel like nothing’s actually going to change now that i’m out to her and i won’t even really be able to talk to her about it much (considering the limited amount we talk already, and not wanting every single conversation with her to be about my identity) and it feels like it will have all been pointless. what do i do?**

edit: one last thing i feel like adding is that regardless of my identity and coming out, she’s someone who i’ve been wanting to become better friends with regardless because she’s just an awesome person. so it isn’t all about coming out but basically i just don’t know how to deliberately become better friends with someone",trans,"came out to a friend who i trust a lot but don’t talk to that much... what now?

my boyfriend is cis. one of the first things i asked him after we confessed we liked each other was if he was okay with me being trans, if he was straight or whatever etc. he said he knew and didn’t really care about gender and that he liked me for who i was. i guess that made me feel okay at the time but i don’t think its super irrational for me to be scared sometimes that when i do go on testosterone, he might not like me anymore? he questioned the side effects of testosterone and asked if it would change my personality. he didn’t mean it in any bad way, but it just made me feel like garbage. he’s supportive of me and calls me my preferred name and pronouns, even around his transphobic mom (which i really appreciated, i guess) 

i brought up that i should probably cut my hair sometime so i look more masculine, as it’s maybe an inch or two past my shoulders right now, and he sort of went “noo, i really like your long hair..” after he said he really wouldnt mind but the comment still stuck with me. the idea that he likes me as a girl just makes me super dysphoric and i know  i shouldn’t think this way, but it’s hard not to when i have a lot of physical qualities of whats perceived as feminine.. sorry. i just had to vent",trans,im pre T ftm and im insecure about my relationship (what else is new),1575812114.0,"{'created_utc': 1575786914, 'id': 'e7qheq', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'for context, i’m not on T yet (will sometime in the near future hopefully), and while i don’t actively try to present femininely, i have shoulder length hair and i only bind with sports bras... \n\nmy boyfriend is cis. one of the first things i asked him after we confessed we liked each other was if he was okay with me being trans, if he was straight or whatever etc. he said he knew and didn’t really care about gender and that he liked me for who i was. i guess that made me feel okay at the time but i don’t think its super irrational for me to be scared sometimes that when i do go on testosterone, he might not like me anymore? he questioned the side effects of testosterone and asked if it would change my personality. he didn’t mean it in any bad way, but it just made me feel like garbage. he’s supportive of me and calls me my preferred name and pronouns, even around his transphobic mom (which i really appreciated, i guess) \n\ni brought up that i should probably cut my hair sometime so i look more masculine, as it’s maybe an inch or two past my shoulders right now, and he sort of went “noo, i really like your long hair..” after he said he really wouldnt mind but the comment still stuck with me. the idea that he likes me as a girl just makes me super dysphoric and i know  i shouldn’t think this way, but it’s hard not to when i have a lot of physical qualities of whats perceived as feminine.. sorry. i just had to vent', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'im pre T ftm and im insecure about my relationship (what else is new)', 'created': 1575812114.0}"

Sorry for the negativity.  I hope it doesn't trigger anyone's dysphoria or anything.  I'm a very dysphoric pre-op trans man who's nearly 3 months on T.  I really don't like my appearance whatsoever, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I feel like I look too feminine.  I'm trying to figure out what else I can do, like getting new glasses or trying a different haircut, but glasses are expensive and so are good haircuts.  I'm broke.  I don't really know how to tolerate, let alone love myself, while I wait for my changes to be more obvious so I can feel at home in my own skin.  Any advice would be appreciated.  I'm tired of being sad and feeling unlovable all of the time.

PS - I'm not trying to project my standards of masculinity for myself onto others.  I think the way that anyone else looks or presents at any given time is fine and I think that other transmasc people are awesome regardless of where they're at and what they intend to look like in the end, but I just don't look the way I always imagine myself in my mind.

Hey :)
I noticed that people often tend to get my identity wrong- some on purpose, why others just do not know better- which is why I decided to post a text where I (attempt to) elaborate why tolerance might be more beneficial for both them and me.
Can I post it like this? Or is there anything I could improve? (Not mainly referring to spelling and grammar here, but rather the tone and the way of formulation)

TW for everyone who may not feel comfortable reading about the discomfort I'm experiencing etc. (I beg your pardon for being kinda bad Trigger warnings. Usually do not need to include these, but assumed it might be appropriate when showing it to a bigger audience)

*********************************

Okay... so this will be my first and (hopefully) only post whose description consists of more than a calendar motto and maybe a few insignificant questions, but I feel like I need to address this topic even though I really do not desire to do so.

Until now I've pretended as if talking about such trivial parts of my identity wouldn't be necessary anymore. Not nowadays. Apparently, I was wrong and have been proven so numerous times.

Never would I expect someone to like me. You can not force someone to feel such emotions towards you; they either do or not, and there is little that you can change about this. But what I DO expect everyone to do is having respect towards each other- regardless of who they are or what they have done- society is lost as soon as we stop valuing someone's trivial requirements to be accepted as a human; this may not be sympathy, but at least tolerance. People can contribute more to our society- and by doing so also to your personal wellbeing- if they are feeling comfortable.

Why haven't I spoken about being trans yet? Why do I only mention it if it's really necessary? The answer is both the most complicated yet simple one: it makes me uncomfortable, invalid, humiliated. This discountenance does on the one hand origin in this psyche of mine which makes me feel irrationally perturbed about something so trivial and- from a perception guided by logic and prudence- normal and unproblematic. Not does it only invoke a sharp pang of discomfort inside of my mind because of the way it makes me perceived this body of mine, but also the mortification I experience every time it reminds me of how unreasonable all of these emotions are; howbeit, I am incapable of changing this.

Despite of the assumption that I wrote this only to earn compassion from whoever reads this that maybe has started flickering up inside of your head while going through the paragraphs above, this is not what I've aspired to achieve as I put these thoughts onto paper. What I really intended to evoke is understanding; no empathy towards this pathetic way of thinking of mine, but the ability to comprehend why I often tend to not come out to people or correct them. 

It is NOT because I am only pretending to be in possession of this mental illness, it is because I do not want to constantly remind people of the fact that I AM in possession of this mental illness. I AM afraid that people will begin to perceive me as a special snowflake as soon as I start to correct them in case they switch up the pronouns. Even though I really crave this acceptance- or at least tolerance- annoying people- possibly making them envy me- is not what I pursue to receive in return.

In case I really did this for attention, wouldn't I feel less insecure about this? Wouldn't I WANT everyone to know about this condition I have to live with? Wouldn't I have put this in my bio, constantly reminded everyone of it, and wrote a text like this WAY sooner? No, I AM serious about this. Why do I justify all of this now? Because I do not see any plausible alternative reactions anymore.
Even though nothing makes me more uncomfortable than coming out to people. What I aspire to achieve is a state where I do not have to tell them by which pronouns they have to call me; where it is obvious that I am not female. Having to tell people such basic facts is one of the most unsettling things I ever had to do. ""If you weren't mentally I'll, if you would count as who you want to be, this would be unnecessary"" These are the thoughts that cross my mind every single time I need to do this. I have to come clean about this ONCE, in case I do not want to ALWAYS feel like I am being invalidated. To make people realize that words- even such little ones as pronouns- DO matter, that they ARE crucial for an individual's wellbeing. 

Even nowadays, people tend to not categorize you as a ""man"", ""woman"" or ""nonbinary individual"" when coming out, but as a ""trans man"", ""trans woman"", ""trans person"" or just a mentally disturbed person who can't come clean with who they are. Just because this is still better than not being accepted as a different general at all, it nevertheless is no option I'd be satisfied with. I only want to be seen as a male individual, not as someone who is transgender. This is nothing I want to feel confident about, nothing I strongly desire others to know about; I just want to be normal- a normal man(or boy. Whatever you consider a 16-year-old as)- and no ""wannabe"". I do not identify as ""trans"", I identify as ""male"", and I'm afraid many humans apprehend this in the preferred way when I actively out myself. Is this irrational?

How would you act if someone- no matter if purposefully or not- would not recognize such trivial aspects of your identity? Of course, the ones that simply do not know aren't the ones to blame- even if it causes uncomfortability, it's not their fault if they get it wrong repeatedly just because you do not inform them. But that's a different case with the people who are perfectly aware of your situation and actively decide to disrespect you. How would you feel if such trivial aspects of your identity would be invalidated by someone? Every. Day. It would for sure have a negative impact on your mental health, and due to this also lower your efficiency and general wellbeing, wouldn't it? So why treating others in a way you wouldn't enjoy them behaving towards you in such a manner? 

It does not hurt to treat each other with this respect, and to be accepted in return. As long as this certain aspect does not harm them or anyone else being tolerant brings nothing but benefits with itself while intolerance provides you with nothing but eventually guilt because you were being unnecessarily rude to someone. People can and will contribute more to your own comfort in case your actions furnish them with it as well.

TLDR: being trans sucks and I feel uncomfortable talking about it-even outing myself- and the fact that I'm not always self-assured enough to speak up for myself should not be taking as a justification for discrimination. I would change the way my brain works if I could, so please do not make life harder than it already is by invalidating my identity. Thank you.

(feel free to skip it. Text starts (and ends) at the asterisks)\n\n\nHey :)\nI noticed that people often tend to get my identity wrong- some on purpose, why others just do not know better- which is why I decided to post a text where I (attempt to) elaborate why tolerance might be more beneficial for both them and me.\nCan I post it like this? Or is there anything I could improve? (Not mainly referring to spelling and grammar here, but rather the tone and the way of formulation)\n\nTW for everyone who may not feel comfortable reading about the discomfort I\'m experiencing etc. (I beg your pardon for being kinda bad Trigger warnings. Usually do not need to include these, but assumed it might be appropriate when showing it to a bigger audience)\n\n*********************************\n\nOkay... so this will be my first and (hopefully) only post whose description consists of more than a calendar motto and maybe a few insignificant questions, but I feel like I need to address this topic even though I really do not desire to do so.\n\nUntil now I\'ve pretended as if talking about such trivial parts of my identity wouldn\'t be necessary anymore. Not nowadays. Apparently, I was wrong and have been proven so numerous times.\n\nNever would I expect someone to like me. You can not force someone to feel such emotions towards you; they either do or not, and there is little that you can change about this. But what I DO expect everyone to do is having respect towards each other- regardless of who they are or what they have done- society is lost as soon as we stop valuing someone\'s trivial requirements to be accepted as a human; this may not be sympathy, but at least tolerance. People can contribute more to our society- and by doing so also to your personal wellbeing- if they are feeling comfortable.\n\nWhy haven\'t I spoken about being trans yet? Why do I only mention it if it\'s really necessary? The answer is both the most complicated yet simple one: it makes me uncomfortable, invalid, humiliated. This discountenance does on the one hand origin in this psyche of mine which makes me feel irrationally perturbed about something so trivial and- from a perception guided by logic and prudence- normal and unproblematic. Not does it only invoke a sharp pang of discomfort inside of my mind because of the way it makes me perceived this body of mine, but also the mortification I experience every time it reminds me of how unreasonable all of these emotions are; howbeit, I am incapable of changing this.\n\nDespite of the assumption that I wrote this only to earn compassion from whoever reads this that maybe has started flickering up inside of your head while going through the paragraphs above, this is not what I\'ve aspired to achieve as I put these thoughts onto paper. What I really intended to evoke is understanding; no empathy towards this pathetic way of thinking of mine, but the ability to comprehend why I often tend to not come out to people or correct them. \n\nIt is NOT because I am only pretending to be in possession of this mental illness, it is because I do not want to constantly remind people of the fact that I AM in possession of this mental illness. I AM afraid that people will begin to perceive me as a special snowflake as soon as I start to correct them in case they switch up the pronouns. Even though I really crave this acceptance- or at least tolerance- annoying people- possibly making them envy me- is not what I pursue to receive in return.\n\nIn case I really did this for attention, wouldn\'t I feel less insecure about this? Wouldn\'t I WANT everyone to know about this condition I have to live with? Wouldn\'t I have put this in my bio, constantly reminded everyone of it, and wrote a text like this WAY sooner? No, I AM serious about this. Why do I justify all of this now?

I’ve been married to a wonderful woman for more that 20 years, we have no children. When we were much younger, early in the marriage (probably 1996) I discovered transgender. I had been cross dressing pretty regularly since my early teens, but I don’t think I knew anything about the possibility of it being deeper than that. I came out to her, and to my doctor. He suggested hormones right away, but I asked instead to see a therapist.

The therapist and I were a terrible fit. I didn’t know any better so I just stopped going. My wife, who at the time was recovering from a pretty violent robbery/assault told me that she ‘married a man’ and I took it to heart. I shut it down completely. She is absolutely mortified that she said that. I don’t think either of us were in a place to handle anything that was happening to us at the time.

So I covered a lot of this with the therapist last week, while we were talking about my sexual past and current kinks. She asked me outright if I thought I was trans, and I said definitely not.

But I can’t stop returning to it. I’m terrified that it might be the case, but it also gives me a sense of elation when I start to daydream about.

I live in a country where minorities are not appreciated.

Those two trans people are not out to me and I am not out to them.


Now, for the story: 

I am (ftm) trans  in 12th grade of school, me and my long time friend- W (who is ftm) go to the same class. W has sister, with has the same class with another trans person- D (ftM) and knows W is trans but is not aware I am.

To add to that, in our school we have one more from trans folk-C (mtf), we know she is trans because of W's sister again. And C knows about W being trans, but dosent know about me.


In our country it's extremely rare to find tolerance for trans people, am not even talking trans people themselve, so me and W got extremely surprised that we have 4 trans people in our school. The problem with everything is, since it's very hard to find trans around, and they seem very friendly, I would like to create a group between 4 of us and just chit chat about thing's, maybe thing's that bother us and stuff like that, but since they don't know I am trans and don't know I know they are trans it would be hard to bring up.

2019-12-10 02:43:05,e8kg5i,4,1,"OK, first post in this community but its something I got thinking about while I should be sleeping &amp; figured it'd be an interesting topic. 


When I was still an egg I used to have to have my hair really short as a kid. I grew it out long when I was in highschool &amp; community college as a head banging stoner but was pressured by my folks to go back to crew cuts for work interviews.

One of the things I've absolutely loved since I began transition is playing around with hairstyles &amp; growing it out.

I'm on about 4 years growth now with no trimming but well looked after (I know, bad, but anxiety &amp; depression kicked my ass for a while)
It currently reaches just above my butt &amp; I've been trying out all the girly hairstyles I wished I could have as a kid/teen but never could before.

I've tried bobs, loose, high tail, low tail, perm, straight. I've even tried some that my mother thinks are too childish for an adult (I beg to differ) plats, dutch &amp; French braids, side-tail etc. 
I think my favourites are the ones my mother hates, not because I'm rebellious but because I like them &amp;  I've only ever received compliments or no comment at all (no one caring).

I'm talking about twintails /pigtails.

I've done high ones (towards the top of your head or above ear) &amp; low ones (below ear /neck nape)
Both suit me as I'm quite bubbly natured &amp; dress accordingly. There are only a couple differences I've noticed between twin tails &amp; other hair styles. 

Lower ones sometimes get me farm girl comments, especially if they're braided, while the high ones just increase the frequency I get ID'd for things. (I have a baby face)

Anyone else done this kind of thing?

I am 37 years old and have never experienced true body dysmorphia, however I've always been interested in being female since I was a kid. Up until last month, it was never more than sometimes dressing up and daydreaming. Transitioning never even crossed my mind as a real option.

But last month something changed in me and I started wondering what that would be like. I looked up articles about HRT. I checked out time-line photos and videos. I started to realize maybe it was actually possible for me to be a woman after all. I still didn't feel like I was trapped in the wrong body or suffering in any way, though.

But now it's been more than a month of exploring this idea, to the point where I have bought my own shapewear and some women's clothes, and regularly dress up when I'm at home with my wife. (She's completely supportive.)

Suddenly I'm starting to feel less comfortable in my own clothes. All I want to wear is the skirts and heels and stuff. And I want more and more to look like a woman, to have the body that matches how I want to see myself. It kind of feels like maybe I allowed myself to feel something I had been suppressing my whole life, and now it (She!) is done waiting and ready to come out.

I live in Switzerland and im 6'5.

Second red flag, i live in switzerland and most of my acquaintances still joke about trans people and dont take them seriously.
I dont wanna transition and constantly get bullied for it.

I remember once when I was 11 I was laying in bed and I began to question if I was actually a boy, or if I wanted to be a boy. That year was when I started to become deeply depressed and anxious, I was really at an all time low and I was extremely self concious of my body. This would be the time I began to go through puberty too, I was self conscious of my new feminine features and I wanted to hide them. I wore oversized clothes constantly. 

Grade 6 we moved to a new school and I made lots of friends, all of which were guys if that says anything. I was still self concious and I never really felt confident being a girl. I remember thinking I'd be more confident as guy and thinking I'd fit in more. 

Grade 7 and 8 I discovered the whole nonbinary thing. I was always aware of the LGBT+ community considering my grandma was married to a women and it was normal to me. I began to experiment with different names, identities and sexualities. However one friend was super transphobic, and made me feel shitty and scared. So most of grade 7 I was closeted bc of that experience. Later on in the year I decides ""screw her"" and got a haircut, started dressing a bit more masculine, and came out as genderfluid to my friends. They didnt really care, some of them made jokes which were a bit hurtful but I didnt mind too much. 
In grade 8 i began the first GSA at my school and I became extremely open of my identity as pansexual and genderfluid. I always felt more like a guy though, I never really had ""feminine"" days. I tested out different names more often back then but my friend got mad and forced me to choose one on the spot and stick with it. I choose Lucas (a name I absolutely hate) but I was too s ared shed lash out at me again so I never said anything. 
That experience really made me..hesitant towards the whole gender thing. I was scared I would make a mistake and all my friends would hate me, so in high school I just said I was cis to avoid any problems. Even though I didnt feel entirely cis. I was very self concious, again, during grade 9 and I always became more confident when I was mistaken for a guy. I felt like I could make friends and be social if I wasnt a girl. I felt the same throughout grade 10, 11, and now 12. 

After grade 9 my depression and anxiety got really bad and I never went to school, ended up dropping out. I was too self concious to go to school, along with just well, feeling shitty and tired. 

The past few months I've really been struggling with my gender identity. I've just been saying I'm nonbinary, since I dont even know what gender I am. But I always feel super self concious about my chest and try to hide it. I feel more confident when I look like a guy, and it's just really confusing?? A part of me is in denial, but another part of me is ready to just move on with it and transition. I dont know what I want or if I'm even trans, and I'm scared I'll be making an irreversible mistake. 

I think I might get a binder and change my name for starters. My mom mentioned to me she wished she just named me Lee (Lee is the second part of my first name, its hyphenated) and that itd suit me. So I think I might actually change it to Lee, or Leon with Lee for short.

Funny story, I actually decided that I'd finally change my name to Lee because I was playing pokemon and kept thinking it was referring to me when they said Lee

My mom mentioned to me she wished she just named me Lee (Lee is the second part of my first name, its hyphenated) and that itd suit me. So I think I might actually change it to Lee, or Leon with Lee for short.\n\nFunny story, I actually decided that I\'d finally change my name to Lee because I was playing pokemon and kept thinking it was referring to me when they said Lee\n\nAnyways, thank u all in advance if you read this and help me !!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I think I'm trans"", 'created': 1576059208.0}"

2019-12-11 04:38:54,e92bu1,2,1,"so i’ve been questioning for close to a year now and over the summer i got to the point where i was *almost* certain i was trans. i never actually reached 100% sure but tended to fluctuate between 80-95% sure most of the time.

i came out to my best friend around a month ago. while obviously this is a big thing to tell anyone, he’s someone who i tell literally everything to, so it wasn’t as big of a deal.

i decided pretty quickly on the person i wanted to come out to next—another close friend of mine who i always felt really comforted and safe around (i also knew she supported the lgbt+ community and had an older sister who’s trans)

last week, i finally got the courage to come out to her. it was an incredible experience, we were both so happy and she offered to help me in any way i needed. she mentioned her older sister (who i’d found out about from the friend i came out to in November, it’s not like it’s common knowledge) and said she doesn’t really talk about it much but she told me a little bit of her sister’s story.

when i came out, i told her that i was *almost* certain but not completely certain, which is how i felt at the time. and in the past week since i came out to her, i’ve been feeling much less sure of myself (maybe around 60%) and it’s making me feel like shit.

i wouldn’t feel that bad if i were wrong about being trans after only coming out to the first person. after all, i tell him everything, so it wouldn’t be much of a big deal.

but now that i spent weeks getting the courage to come out to someone else who i don’t have many personal conversations with and who is likely very sensitive about this topic because of her sister, i’m going to feel like a horrible person if i end up realizing that i’m not trans.

2019-12-11 11:32:18,e95yrc,3,1,"Since coming out, I've been mulling over several thoughts. I'm sharing them because I hope that they would be helpful to anyone going through a similar experience. 


1) Being a woman has nothing to do with what your breasts look like, or how how wide your hips are, or however long your hair is. Your personal relationship with your identity and what society recognizes you as are two different things. This makes sense intellectually, but emotionally dysphoria is a bitch. As such, I think it's important to ask yourself why you are gravitating towards a specific image. This is not to say you should stop gravitating towards an image, but I think it's important to know the underlying reason why. Do you want to present as more feminine because that is what your image of a woman is like? Where did that image come from? Why do you like it so much? Go for it, but when you aren't feeling 100% feminine remind yourself that you are still a woman, no matter how far away you are from what you want. 


2) After talking with a friend, we came to the conclusion that women come in all shapes and sizes. If you don't look like an instagram model, understand that 99.9% of women also don't look like them. Some women have strong jawlines, some have more masculine eyebrows. Accept that while you are more masculine looking, it doesn't matter. You are just adding to that spectrum. (Again, dysphoria is a bitch, and while I love this idea I sometimes don't feel it.)

3) ""Boy mode"" doesn't seem like the right word. You are you, it doesn't matter if others don't know. You are just presenting yourself in a more masculine way. You are the only thing you have control over, which means that as long as you are learning to accept and better yourself, everyone else can eat shit. 


4) Recently I've been rewarding myself by simply saying that I look good. When you wake up, tell yourself that you are beautiful. When you aren't wearing makeup, tell yourself again. At first it may feel like you are lying to yourself, but keep at it. Reward yourself mentally when you feel your shittiest. If it has been helping me, it may help you.

2019-12-11 13:22:22,e971al,9,1,"I've considered myself genderfluid for several years now. I do lean hardcore towards masc stuff (I tend to mentally cringe when called ma'am, lady, princess, miss, etc) I present very feminine physically. I have a VERY feminine body. However I question myself almost daily... It's difficult since I don't quite share that with any friends, so I have little support for it. I find myself wishing I had different genitalia in general, having a flat chest, having a well-kept scruffy and short beard... I've done crossdressing. I look cute with a beard. I feel SO confident when I decide to present as male. But there are days I feel lovely presenting as female, I flaunt my curves, I wear cute makeup. It's confusing and I don't understand it, but I suppose that's genderfluidity.

But the real question I have here is whether or not I could even be classified as trans. The trans community feels so right for me, but I'd feel god awful if I was unintentionally grouping myself with those who wouldn't consider me part of their group.

I came out around a month or 2 ago as trans, before I identified as non-binary because I had a boyfriend (still do, he supports me :)) who I was scared would not want to be w me if I mentioned how I was questioning my gender. I’ve questioned my gender since I was 12 (18) but don’t talk ab it often except for w my bf now and my bff(s) who 2/3 are also transmale. My boyfriends friends aren’t as accepting, including my own parents. My mom knows ab me struggling w my gender for a long time but doesn’t acknowledge it since I started wearing makeup and feminine clothes 2 yrs ago (I’ve always liked glitter and pink and stuff but fluctuate and wear masculine things  once in a while). She thinks it’s not possible to be transmale and like girly things, and ignores my pronouns, and only calls me my preferred name if I ignore her which really hurts because even my bfs dad accepts me. 
   My bfs friends (2/4) are not keen on it. His guy friend when I was non-binary told him that I should just pick a gender, so when he finds out I’m trans I feel like he would make fun of me for it because I’m pretty sure he’s transphobic. And his girl friend says I can’t be trans because I don’t try to pass. But I really do try. I have a feminine face and body and no matter what I’ve done I just don’t pass in people’s eyes. I wear a binder, I pack, make my voice deeper and I cut my hair shorter and started wearing more masculine things and less makeup in order to pass. It didn’t work so I just wear what I want and wear as much makeup as I want so she sees it as my faking it because I’ve never told her how I’ve questioned my gender. It really sucks because I can’t get medicine or chest surgery and I’ve felt this way for a really long time and it obviously hasn’t gone away so this isn’t just some phase or way to get attention for me. Idk, she used my age as a way to say I should be “faking my identity” (I’m 18) but like, I’m still figuring myself out so I don’t know why I’m suddenly an adult in her eyes if she’s just a yr younger than me.

2019-12-11 23:09:10,e9ex28,0,1,"I just want to share two coming out experiences that I’ve had, and the difference with how it has affected me.

Back in 2016, for the first time I had placed myself onto face my gender dysphoria and accept myself as trans. As I had recently moved to Argentina( I am originally from Brazil and lived for a while in the US as part of my family is american, or united stadian as they say over here heheh) I had nearly no friends here but one of my dearest friends was an Argentina gay cis male, a wonderful person, with buddhist beliefs and values but as all of us had his own set of flaws. Him being gay and some one I trusted he was than the person I first came out to, and his reaction was of laughter, treated it all as a joke and said “ thats just repressed desire to being fucked, of being a sissy bottom” ( or something like that in argentine slang ) it threw me down, i felted helpless and lost and as if he was treating me like that, what could I expect from the strange and cruel world out there. So back to the closet for me.

The years passed and I couldn’t help but fall into depression and feeling like it’s time to face my issues once again, being alone felt like I had no chance to overcome anything only to start having suicidal thoughts for the first time in a couple of years ( since early 2016 ). So now with a larger and new range of friends, last night I came out to a girl who has become my best friend this last couple of years, and she was the cutest about it, I’ve never felt so accepted. It was a big night of party and hope as the new president received the formally the command of the presidency  and being a very pro lgbtqi+ it was amazing which inspired me to come out to my besty. 

So the moral of the story is on one hand don’t presume that other lgbtqi+ people will be automatically accepting of your identity, but don’t let that throw you down, find people who will support and love you and will be happy for you being yourself, it makes the whole difference.

Since I had received my doctor's letter as an e-mail in the first place, I had to then re-contact my doctor, have a new letter mailed to me (I moved from NYC recently), and mail that in.

All that was done about 2 weeks ago, but I still haven't heard anything new from the State Department.

Family member of ex bfs family called me a tranny (in a derogatory manner), and I told my partner. He kept it to himself until recently as they started treating us like sh** out of nowhere. When he text them basically confronting them, they flipped out and started acting like it was not transphobic at all and started threatening and slandering me. Now my partners dad is  a horrible person. He treated his wife like shit in a 20+ year abusive manipulative relationship, and because she did not want to be appearing to side with transphobia, she has since kicked him out of the house and he is now living with his phobic family right?

Now I'm very sick, I have fibromyalgia and it hurts to walk, but ofcourse I must be ""faking being sick"" because 🤷‍♀️. So I send her a message saying:

""Excuse me.. But I would just like to say that the dwp have called me, and we've straightened it out. I'm not breaking any laws, so I thought maybe you and your family could stop targeting me now for power gains. So I will now stop talking to you all. I'm no longer anything to do with you all. Thanks"".

This is what I'm up against.. Her reply:

""Listen... fuck off if you’ve got a problem message bobby or get Sean to phone him. I’ve no interest in either of you. I see you can’t answer the phone. Nobody has a problem with you being trans as you keep throwing down my throat. It’s about you being lazy arse sponger who was claiming illegally because mandy told us. You want to sit in flea pit bedroom claiming off everyone’s taxes.""

I work in a hospital and I have a patient scheduled for a procedure who is a trans female. This person identifies and lives as a woman, takes hormones and has breast implants, but has not had gender reassignment surgery.
The referral from this patients family doctor lists her as a male.

I work in Breast Oncology so the vast majority of my patients are women. We do get a few men, but this is the first time I have had a transgendered patient.

Our registration system unfortunately only allows for ""male"" or ""female"" which is something that I have put forward to my manager as a concern but I'm just a little fish with no authority and there is no way that anything in our system is going to be updated prior to this patient's appointment. Also, the questionnaire that we have to give to patients is also only for ""male"" or ""female"". Our female questionnaire says FEMALE in bold letters across the top and asks about menstruation and pregnancies, etc. Our Male questionnaire says MALE in bold and is much shorter and does not have fields that would be irrelevant to that gender. I do not want to make this person feel uncomfortable by handing them a male questionnaire but the female form is mostly irrelevant to this person's health.

My concern is, what can I do to make this patient feel as comfortable as possible during this already stressful and horrible time in her life? 

What can I say to upper management that will help me get the changes in place to make things more inclusive for patients?

Went to a group counseling thing for a couple weeks and saw this more nerdy and quirky looking girl there who I wanted to talk to outside.  Never felt comfortable doing it right after the sessions and never saw her outside before.  Funny enough, I saw her at my dorm a few days later, tried to get her attention, but was a bitch and couldn't raise my voice higher than a whimper before I gave up.  Then I saw her again at the dining hall and thought I should talk to her (as well as a thousand other fleeting thoughts in my mind.)

I'm _mostly_ straight and had never been with a trans person, but always thought maybe I could if they looked feminine enough.

I was still attracted to her and kept thinking about different ways things could go all night.  Thought about if I should still go for it, how she'd felt if I asked, what does that make me, why do I care, what would I tell friends and family, why am I overthinking things again.  Decided next day to just ask if she was trans and she said she was.  Then I said I thought she still looked cute and she said her bf thinks so too.  My heart sank because for all 14,000,685 possibilities I saw last night, this was the one I dreaded the most.

Does anybody have any good stories or pics about transitioning later or going from one extreme to the other?

Basically I'm a pre-everything trans man, and I am dealing with a lot of fear about transitioning because I'm 25 and probably LITERALLY what people think of when they think of ""wife material"", I mean like, hourglass figure, pretty soft facial features, I've been praised all my life for being really beautiful. And my behavior is a concern too....I'm gentle and friendly, not really overtly feminine but I've found I can't force being masculine, I certainly don't talk like a man because I spend most of my time around women, and if I don't over-perform the perkiness associated with my appearance, I'm seen as rude.

When I first sussed out I was trans I was really out and proud, but when I entered adult life &amp; the job market everything was a struggle, I was constantly harassed for Actually Trying to be masculine. Things only got easy and successful when I pushed myself back into the closet, more or less. I came to the conclusion that it's not worth trying so hard until I pass, but now I'm not even trying to transition because I'm convinced that I won't ever pass, because of how feminine I am. I'm terrified I'll put in a bunch of effort and time and money only to never been seen as a man.

So tldr I was hoping anybody with similar experiences could share. How did you cope on a day to day basis?

 Dear Audible,  


Recently a friend of mine was looking at Audible for books on the subject of trans people. They specifically searched for ""transgender.""

2019-12-14 11:47:15,eaitow,0,1,"tw: eating disorders, dysphoria

Hey, trans community.
I'm 35, will probably never transition but have problems with dysphoria. I know dysphoria will be with me as long as i live like this. It's a consequence of my choice. I accept it.

My problem is as much with my coping mechanisms as with my dysphoria per se. More specifically the results of neglecting my body for years.


I developed bulimia when my body hit puberty, because i wanted my breasts and hips  to shrink, and i heard it would lose me my period. 

Ten years later, bulimia was a more constant problem than dysphoria, so i spent a year being treated for that.

In that time, i started gaining weight. My already big breasts and hips grew even larger, and it developed into a catch 22 of sort. Dieting would hurt my recovery from bulimia, growing fatter would increase my dysphoria.

I chose to grow fat. Dressed in jeans and flannel. I learned to ignore my body, pretend that i was just human, not specifically female. Other people lost sexual interest in me. I was 26 but felt like 60.  

Then my brand of jeans was discontinued, and i just gave up. Started wearing dresses every day. After a year or so, the dresses didn't feel like a costume anymore, on especially undysphoric days i like the look of them (all somber, black, loose). When i feel male, my dresses don't negate it anymore.

But. My increasing fatness has reached a point where it has to be addressed. I work in an office, but my ankles feel like those of a retail worker. But dieting is so fucking hard. I've ignored my body for ten years, and now i try to care about it. And it just makes me dysphoric as hell. 

Now i wonder 
I will attend a fat camp after Christmas. Should i tell them about my dysphoria? Like will that make it easier for them to help me?

2019-12-14 17:27:25,eamhj9,3,1,"hi everybody.

so currently i am a 21 year old male.

in my childhood i never questioned my gender or sexuality. i was quite a typical boy, interested in football and video games.

fast forward to 16 and i started questioning my sexuality. i started to enjoy gay porn as well as straight porn. whilst my ‘crushes’ where all on girls i started to have fantasies about being dominated by men. also at this time i developed a crippling insecurity over my looks, i could barely look in a mirror and felt like the ugliest person in the world. 

this insecurity over my looks started to clear when i was 18. around this time i developed a huge fascination with trans women. i actually had a brief hookup with a trans woman at this time but was too nervous to really enjoy it.

i have ‘slept’ with four cis women since then, however despite enjoying kissing i lost my arousal and often erectjon when then clothes came off.

this led me to think i was gay, about a year ago. i rarely see guys i find attractive in real life but i am so attracted to penises and not attracted to vaginas much at all. most of my fantasies are of me getting penetrated by an older dominant guy.

though despite this i the porn i enjoy the most is trans porn, by an absolute mile. i actually rarely ever watch it because it feels like a drug to me (and i know it can be seen as fetishising). second to that is straight porn and last gay porn.

i love looking at beautiful women, i can’t take my eyes off them i’m public. yet when i’ve had sex with women it’s been underwhelming. i also love looking at pictures of beautiful trans women online.

could it be that i’m looking at these women because i want to be them? and maybe i am attracted to women but just not as a man?

i feel jealous when i see lesbian relationships and maybe jealous of cute trans girls i see online.

i don’t feel dysphoric over my body but i do feel maybe a little jealous of how pretty women are. i have quite soft features and i like that, i wouldn’t want to look like a masculine male. i would rather be pretty or cute than rugged. i do like my penis though.

i also love female clothing and feel jealous as boys clothing is nowhere near as fun. though it’s never been a big issue to me.

also i sometimes fantasise about cross dressing during sex but usually quickly repress these thoughts.

these things would probably hint towards me being trans, yet until this month i’ve never questioned my gender or felt bad about being a male. i have had turbulent mental health since puberty but my gender has never been a concern.

could i really be trans and not realise till now?

(sorry i know this post is all over the place, i have a hard time describing my sexuality)

2019-12-14 23:55:44,earfry,0,1,"hi everybody.

so currently i am a 21 year old male.

in my childhood i never questioned my gender or sexuality. i was quite a typical boy, interested in football and video games.

fast forward to 16 and i started questioning my sexuality. i started to enjoy gay porn as well as straight porn. whilst my ‘crushes’ where all on girls i started to have fantasies about being dominated by men. also at this time i developed a crippling insecurity over my looks, i could barely look in a mirror and felt like the ugliest person in the world. 

this insecurity over my looks started to clear when i was 18. around this time i developed a huge fascination with trans women. i actually had a brief hookup with a trans woman at this time but was too nervous to really enjoy it.

i have ‘slept’ with four cis women since then, however despite enjoying kissing i lost my arousal and often erectjon when then clothes came off.

this led me to think i was gay, about a year ago. i rarely see guys i find attractive in real life but i am so attracted to penises and not attracted to vaginas much at all. most of my fantasies are of me getting penetrated by an older dominant guy.

though despite this i the porn i enjoy the most is trans porn, by an absolute mile. i actually rarely ever watch it because it feels like a drug to me (and i know it can be seen as fetishising). second to that is straight porn and last gay porn.

i love looking at beautiful women, i can’t take my eyes off them i’m public. yet when i’ve had sex with women it’s been underwhelming. i also love looking at pictures of beautiful trans women online.

could it be that i’m looking at these women because i want to be them? and maybe i am attracted to women but just not as a man?

i feel jealous when i see lesbian relationships and maybe jealous of cute trans girls i see online.

i don’t feel dysphoric over my body but i do feel maybe a little jealous of how pretty women are. i have quite soft features and i like that, i wouldn’t want to look like a masculine male. i would rather be pretty or cute than rugged. i do like my penis though.

i also love female clothing and feel jealous as boys clothing is nowhere near as fun. though it’s never been a big issue to me.

also i sometimes fantasise about cross dressing during sex but usually quickly repress these thoughts.

these things would probably hint towards me being trans, yet until this month i’ve never questioned my gender or felt bad about being a male. i have had turbulent mental health since puberty but my gender has never been a concern.

could i really be trans and not realise till now?

(sorry i know this post is all over the place, i have a hard time describing my sexuality)

fast forward to about 6th grade, I was 11-12. i had found a YouTuber who identified as nonbinary. at the time, I was also questioning my gender. I decided I wanted to change my name to the YouTuber's name, probably because I liked them so much. my mom found out and told me to reconsider.

moving onto 8th grade, I was 13-14.

here I am today, 15 1/2. I have the name Sam in my head for about 3-4 years now, gave it to an oc that I used to represent me, and now I'm using the name.

when I announced to 5 of my close friends that I have decided to change my name from Emily to Sam, I felt extremely happy. I felt super accepted when they told me they would call me that from now on. I feel so appreciated and so loved.

I'm pre everything as I'm only an adolescent and my mom isn't supportive.

So, I have some tips for you guys that you may or may not have heard of.

1. Shave your face, and I mean the entirety of it. DONT SHAVE YOUR EYEBROWS OFF! THATS NOT WHAT I MEAN. But women have peach fuzz hair on their face that men don't. So I suggest doing it once or twice a morning.

2. Don't. Bind. For. More. Than. 8. Hours. Consistently. It'll ruin your chances of getting top surgery.

3. Try to speak in a monotone voice and not flucuate. Womens' voices tend to change pitch a lot while talking. 

4. Try not to have your hair in your face, as this may be perceived as female to strangers.

5. Exercise. It helps increase testosterone if you do it right. Depending on what level you're at with physical activity, around 3 times a week for around 45 minutes is a good starting point. (If you want, I'll make a post about good exercises and make up a good fitness schedule, I won't do it unless someone wants me to, and no I'm not a fitness buff xD)

6. Eat some protein, and drink milk. I'll gather a list of foods that help raise testosterone, but a few are bananas, eggs, fish, oysters, and almonds.

7. I know being on your period is dysphoric, but it does increase testosterone for that time period. But if you can't handle it, then go on birth control pills or something.

8. Shower at least once or twice a week. It's actually healthier not to shower everyday, as it makes your skin dry and you can get sick easier when your skin is dry.

Dark Souls in general has been a series close to my heart and my apologies if this isn't so much discussion of the game itself but rather how it helped me through a dark period in my life so feel free to remove if needed.
Any way I got into Dark Souls about a year or two after it came out so I was 22 at the time. At the time I had been battling depression and was suicidal along with just being unsatisfied with how my life was. No matter what I did I'd always fall back into this hole of self hatred and doubt. I recall my friend giving me a call saying they wanted to try out a game they picked up. Said being Dark Souls. I had heard of it but wasn't interested at first due to generally not liking the supposed difficulty aspect of it but I figured I needed to try something new so I said fuck it and sure enough, they drove over and we played. My friend startee a new profile for me and the game had made quite an impression on me. I would say it was the first time I smiled in a long while at that point. My friend let me borrow it so I spent the entire day rushing through! Every boss was just a new adventure to me but when I made it to Dark Sun Gwyndolin. Something about them always resonated with me and after beating them, I decided to look into the lore and what I found struck something deep in me.
""Born of the Moon and raised as a daughter.""
Something about that just made me ponder and for days I would debate with myself if these feelings were true, if I truly felt this way or if it was the depression talking. I had drove to my friend's apartment to return the game but I wanted to discuss with them what I felt and they told me something that changed my life forever.
""(Deadname) you've gone your whole thing feeling sorry for yourself and not knowing what to do. I'd consider this a moment of clarity for you. How you were born is irrelevant and all that matters is now. Your connection to Gwyndolin isn't a coincidence. (Deadname) I love you and I will support you.""
I hugged them in a flurry of tears and couldn't believe for the first time in years I had found my purpose. I found what made me happy. I found myself. Everything suddenly clicked into place and made sense and the world no longer seemed as dark or scary as before. I eventually sought therapy and received an official diagnosis of gender dysphoria. I even outright considered changing my name to Gwyndolin but that's my story.
The Soulsborbe series ever since has been held near and dear to me and I always await a new game from FromSoft. I know this all sounds sappy but Dark Souls truly helped me out of a dark chapter in my life. I'm grateful to Dark Souls and to the wondeful community that has grown from it.

 Thank you for taking time to open this. 
     Im 20 years young, and I've known how I've felt for as long as I can remember, but had no social support and no-one i could talk to to validate my feelings till i recently decided to tell my best friend, and he has been my singular shining pillar of support. Though there are limits to how much he can help, not being able to understanding from a firsthand perspective the feelings I can't put fully into words.
      I yearn to not just surround myself with beauty, but to be beautiful, to be seen as the person I know i should be.

Then when i tried to tell my ex-best friend back in middle school he avoided me for two months and then he'd only hang out with me around other friends until i told him i wasnt serious.

On the other hand, I feel kind of... guilty? About even considering this? I don't have any bad associations with my current name and I even got the traditionally masculine spelling.

So after I moved out I worked as a stripper in a strip club even though that wasnt really me but I had no hope nor money and I met that gay guy who thought I was  a real guy at a cafe ,we started dating but once he discovered that I was trans( I told him )) he snapped and started telling me all type of terrible things until he raped me then I got pregnant  I went homeless for 2 years after that due to losing my job cause of pregnancy (I couldn't do abortion due to health issues and it being very risky for my life neither did I have the money to pay for it even after begging my parents )) but then I borrowed some money from my parents after begging them and they allowed me to live with them but then my parents divorced after 3 month and my father got a new girlfriend which we were both attracted to ,so i started having an affair with his girlfriends( she liked me back) but he ended up discovering it last week....  I have no idea what to do hes telling me he will sue me ect idk anything about legal matters also his girlfriend is acting like a victim claiming i raped her I'm not a good mother either my son isnt being taken care of really well and im having issue making money to support his expenses im really thinking of putting him up for adoption and ending my life ( also im a heavy drug users which is making me unable to save up money  ( I usualy sell my body as a trans person ( yes some people have fetish for that )) especially now that my father isnt with us anymore I I NOVODY to take money from and I have no idea where my mother went after the divorce

Does anybody have any advice or have been through this after their name change? Trying to figure out how to get my name updated with the bureaus.

2019-12-19 17:05:37,ecw1e4,2,1,"Hi guys, this is my first post in this sub so I hope I dont cross any boundaries. 

My question is:

Is there anyway for a long-haired girl to wear a male’s wig everyday without it looking obvious? 

[This is me &amp; my hair](https://imgur.com/gallery/ASmWsfS)


Some background:

I’m a trans girl, 25, have been transitioning for more than a year (without hormones); and my hair is almost shoulder length now. Since I have no HRT (hormones replacement therapy) and haven’t had any facial feminization surgery, the only thing that makes me pass as a girl and have confidence in my femininity is my hair. In short, my hair makes my woman look. 

I recently got a job working for Hilton (the huge hospitality chain) in Japan and even though the internal people are very open to lgbt, they have no policy for trans people (Japan can be really conservative and slow progress when it comes to this). 

I’m asked to present as male during work and they ask me to cut my hair into a men’s style. To me this is like reverting all the transition I’ve done the past year and I dont know if I can endure seeing myself short-haired again.... 

My job is starting 6th of January and I’m so desperate right now. Please help me and if there is a detailed guide on how to wear a men wig for women, please send it my way. 

Thank you so much for reading this and any help is much appreciated!

——————————————

Hi Mami and Papi! I want you both to know that I love you both to the moon and back. I’ve already shared my story with Faith and she has given me nothing but love and acceptance, and I love her even more than I can bare. I hope you can do the same. Before proceeding, I need you to prepare your hearts with love and understanding as well because you will need it. All I want for Christmas is your love and acceptance. I’ll ask that you please let me finish what I have to say before you ask any questions. Also, please don’t kick me out.

I will always be the child you raised me to be, and I love you both for it so much, but I am not your son. I never was. I am your daughter. Let me explain. 

Starting At A Young Age

I remember vividly being at my grandparents house at about age 5 praying to god that I would wake up with a girl’s body. I woke up with the biggest disappointment that I still remember to this day.

Again, extremely young, I remember playing with my brother Justin and pretending to get married. I had Justin wear a blanket as a bride, and then we switched roles and I got to wear the blanket as a dress, and I remember enjoying that feeling. 

I remember in middle school, my friends were wiccans and they talked about how they could cast a spell on someone and make their penis fall off. I secretly wished they would cast the spell on me. Also, most of my friends in middle school were girls. I got homeschooled for high school so I didn’t have many friends but I liked hanging out with the girls at church too.

In video games, I would often role play as females. 

When I was 18 I had sex with a female and I didn’t orgasm. I then had mutual oral sex with a gay man, and I orgasmed very quickly. But I didn’t feel gay. I thought something was really wrong with me.

About Body Image

And one time, when I was about 19 or so, I was compelled to wax my legs, and I loved the feeling of it.

And one time I went snowboarding with my brothers and friends and I had the girls put mascara on me for the fuck of it and I felt like I was coming out of my shell.

At pride festival 2017, I dressed in Diana’s underwear and jacket and it was one of the best nights of my life. I felt closer to me than I had ever before. 

I have since shaved my legs again, and I love the feeling of it! I have also worn makeup and felt very pretty!

About Relationsthips

Some of my relationships in the past have been with masculine looking females. The relationships were always awkward, forced. One even mentioned it herself that our dynamic felt forced. I felt awkward being a “man” in the relationship. I was always very passive in how I handled myself. I was never aggressive in the slightest while pursuing sex with girls. 

And My best friend Brighton, I loved him. I cried my heart out when our relationship went sour over my denial of Christianity. I remember just being in the bathroom at the dorm sobbing. I didn’t understand these feelings at all at the time. My relationships with guys have all been natural, and easy going. And I have been immensely more aggressive about having sex with men. I also love being the little spoon! 

About Dreams And Visions

I had a dream about beauty and the beast where I was the beauty and the beast was chasing me around the mansion. I didn’t understand this dream at the time but now I do.

I’ve also had many dreams where I was female and they were my favorite dreams, because I felt comfortable in my own skin. I hated waking up from those.

Also, one time on an acid trip, I closed my eyes and had a vision where I saw my genitalia getting ripped away to show a vagina. The subconscious is indeed very powerful. At first I was like “wtf?!” But now this makes sense to me.

My Identity

Obviously, I don’t identify as a gay male, I identify as a female. And since doing so, I have felt more at home with myself. I’ve been insurmountably more happy with myself as well. I feel like a veil has been lifted from my eyes.

For my whole life I have craved love and acceptance from others, and now I realize this is because I could not love and accept myself as my desire to be a female has been so so repressed.

Since I have accepted myself, I have then found love and peace for myself. It’s an incredible feeling and I want to share it with the world!

I feel like I discovered the heart beat of the universe in myself. I’ve descended into madness in stages of denying, ignoring, fighting, and finally embracing it.

Seize life with all your might; we exist only for an instant. This, here and now is God’s gift.

I was born this way, there’s no question in my mind anymore. Female is what I am. The carpet just doesn’t match the drapes if you know what I mean, so I’ve decided I want to go through transition, fully. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I’m grabbing life by the horns.

Is This A Psychotic Break?

Before you say you think this is a psychotic break, I assure you it is not. I have given that serious thought and got 3 friend’s opinions; after discussion, no one thought it was. I went to IOP (education on psychotic breaks) for about a year. I understand what a psychotic break is because of the class and what I went through 2 years ago. Here’s why it’s not a psychotic break:
1. I’m not paranoid
2. I don’t believe I’m Jesus or god 
3. I’m not looking for secret messages in the tv or any type of material
4. I don’t have delusions of reference
5. I don’t think that anyone is out to get me, the government or secret organization or whatever
6. I’m not having any sort of schizophrenic hallucinations
7. I have felt this way my entire life

Furthermore, I am no longer depressed about having schizophrenia, because I don’t. I have finally gotten a doctors opinion on that. I have been stable off meds for the last 8 months with no schizophrenic symptoms. But I was still depressed after having discovered I don’t have schizophrenia, and I didn’t know why. I now understand that my gender identity was the root of the cause of my depression since I no longer want to die, now that I’ve resolved my identity. I now have a vision for my future, and it is beautiful and I want to live to see how it plays out. I haven’t felt this much happiness or peace in my entire life. I know what I want. 

I think I believe in fate now. As the only person who asked me to tell my story during driving lyft turned out to be a doctor for the LGBT community. He connected me with resources that I desperately needed the next day.

I also believe in fate because papi met Steve Levinson, my old boss, in an uber, whose own son is also transgender. He holds support groups for parents of transgender children. And I want to connect you with him. I have his email, so you should be able to contact him through there.

My name given at birth was Nathaniel Gabriel Moreno. I always felt dysphoria when I heard my name called, hence why I always shortened it to nathan and then Nate. The dysphoria never went away. Nathaniel means God’s gift. I actually believe my gender dysphoria to be God’s gift to me.

My actual name is Natalie Gabriela Moreno. I chose the name Natalie because I think it’s a very pretty name and feels right to me. Coincidentally, it also turn out that it’s an anagram of Nathaniel (meaning the letters used are both the same) but without the letters h and extra n. Metaphorically, it’s me without the body dysphoria. Also coincidentally, it turns out that it means Christmas, and I thought that was fitting given I figured this out during the holiday season. Finding myself is the best Christmas gift of my life. Because I am so happy, I am quite literally, merry Christmas!",trans,My coming out letter to my parents,1576820586.0,"{'created_utc': 1576795386, 'id': 'ed0t16', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey everyone!

I felt closer to me than I had ever before. \n\nI have since shaved my legs again, and I love the feeling of it! I have also worn makeup and felt very pretty!\n\nAbout Relationsthips\n\nSome of my relationships in the past have been with masculine looking females. The relationships were always awkward, forced. One even mentioned it herself that our dynamic felt forced. I felt awkward being a “man” in the relationship. I was always very passive in how I handled myself. I was never aggressive in the slightest while pursuing sex with girls. \n\nAnd My best friend Brighton, I loved him. I cried my heart out when our relationship went sour over my denial of Christianity. I remember just being in the bathroom at the dorm sobbing. I didn’t understand these feelings at all at the time. My relationships with guys have all been natural, and easy going. And I have been immensely more aggressive about having sex with men. I also love being the little spoon! \n\nAbout Dreams And Visions\n\nI had a dream about beauty and the beast where I was the beauty and the beast was chasing me around the mansion. I didn’t understand this dream at the time but now I do.\n\nI’ve also had many dreams where I was female and they were my favorite dreams, because I felt comfortable in my own skin. I hated waking up from those.\n\nAlso, one time on an acid trip, I closed my eyes and had a vision where I saw my genitalia getting ripped away to show a vagina. The subconscious is indeed very powerful. At first I was like “wtf?!” But now this makes sense to me.\n\nMy Identity\n\nObviously, I don’t identify as a gay male, I identify as a female. And since doing so, I have felt more at home with myself. I’ve been insurmountably more happy with myself as well. I feel like a veil has been lifted from my eyes.\n\nFor my whole life I have craved love and acceptance from others, and now I realize this is because I could not love and accept myself as my desire to be a female has been so so repressed.\n\nSince I have accepted myself, I have then found love and peace for myself. It’s an incredible feeling and I want to share it with the world!\n\nI feel like I discovered the heart beat of the universe in myself. I’ve descended into madness in stages of denying, ignoring, fighting, and finally embracing it.\n\nSeize life with all your might; we exist only for an instant. This, here and now is God’s gift.\n\nI was born this way, there’s no question in my mind anymore. Female is what I am. The carpet just doesn’t match the drapes if you know what I mean, so I’ve decided I want to go through transition, fully. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I’m grabbing life by the horns.\n\nIs This A Psychotic Break?\n\nBefore you say you think this is a psychotic break, I assure you it is not. I have given that serious thought and got 3 friend’s opinions; after discussion, no one thought it was. I went to IOP (education on psychotic breaks) for about a year. I understand what a psychotic break is because of the class and what I went through 2 years ago. Here’s why it’s not a psychotic break:\n1. I’m not paranoid\n2. I don’t believe I’m Jesus or god \n3. I’m not looking for secret messages in the tv or any type of material\n4. I don’t have delusions of reference\n5. I don’t think that anyone is out to get me, the government or secret organization or whatever\n6. I’m not having any sort of schizophrenic hallucinations\n7. I have felt this way my entire life\n\nFurthermore, I am no longer depressed about having schizophrenia, because I don’t. I have finally gotten a doctors opinion on that. I have been stable off meds for the last 8 months with no schizophrenic symptoms. But I was still depressed after having discovered I don’t have schizophrenia, and I didn’t know why. I now understand that my gender identity was the root of the cause of my depression since I no longer want to die, now that I’ve resolved my identity. I now have a vision for my future, and it is beautiful and I want to live to see how it plays out. I haven’t felt this much happiness or peace in my entire life. I know what I want. \n\nI think I believe in fate now. As the only person who asked me to tell my story during driving lyft turned out to be a doctor for the LGBT community. He connected me with resources that I desperately needed the next day.\n\nI also believe in fate because papi met Steve Levinson, my old boss, in an uber, whose own son is also transgender. He holds support groups for parents of transgender children. And I want to connect you with him. I have his email, so you should be able to contact him through there.\n\nMy name given at birth was Nathaniel Gabriel Moreno. I always felt dysphoria when I heard my name called, hence why I always shortened it to nathan and then Nate. The dysphoria never went away. Nathaniel means God’s gift. I actually believe my gender dysphoria to be God’s gift to me.\n\nMy actual name is Natalie Gabriela Moreno. I chose the name Natalie because I think it’s a very pretty name and feels right to me. Coincidentally, it also turn out that it’s an anagram of Nathaniel (meaning the letters used are both the same) but without the letters h and extra n. Metaphorically, it’s me without the body dysphoria. Also coincidentally, it turns out that it means Christmas, and I thought that was fitting given I figured this out during the holiday season. Finding myself is the best Christmas gift of my life. Because I am so happy, I am quite literally, merry Christmas!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My coming out letter to my parents', 'created': 1576820586.0}"

2019-12-20 02:18:35,ed3jij,1,1,"Hello to any nice people reading this. I watched a video of jessica kellgren-fozard today (check her out on youtube, seriously, the most wholesome channel I can imagine) where she was talking about her physical disabilities and how she described it was oddly familiar.

Because that's very close to how I feel about my brain, my... psychological physiology so to speak. Which got me thinking and I just want to get some of these thoughts somewhere, so why not where I might discuss it and where maybe someone might even (maybe) profit from them.
As trans people, we're always confronted with 'why' by other people, but just as much by ourselves. And while everyone has their own individual answer, I feel like putting it in words is the tough part.
The video (I'm going to link it, just have to find it after typing) made me take a step back and take a different approach to phrasing it. When people get ill, they talk about what their body is telling them, they're differenciating between themselves and the body. So let's do the same to our minds as well. Meaning we have three components:
'me': the part that actively thinks and decides

the physical body: well... yea

the 'psychological' body: basically everything subconscious. feelings, emotions, desires... 

And I feel like for most people, they understand what both lf their bodies are telling the 'me', so the 'me' can come to conclusions and decisions. But adding my own experience to that makes it very clear that while my physical body tells me very well what is happening, my psychological one doesn't.

I realized that just like jessica, who couldn't tell whether she was tired or hungry or hot or cold, I can't tell what emotions I'm going through. What my desires are, my wishes, my emotions. And that leads to a bad situation: that I, the deciding person inside my body, am not directly wired to my subconsciousness. Well, not correctly at least. I do feel something stirring sunconsciously, I just can't decipher it. I am getting signals, I am just not able to interpret them. As if they were ment for a person residing within a different physical body.

And I was able to confirm that very quickly: by first imagining a blank person and label it 'me'. Then giving it a gender, in my case male. And as a last step, giving it attributes, anything except purely physical ones. Attributes I think I have, ones I don't like, or ones that I'd like to have. That's pretty difficult and really frustrating to try, because it just doesn't work. Like trying fill a bucket of water with my hands.

But switching it up, by once again imagining a blank me, but this time making it female (in my case) before trying to 'accessorizing' it with attributes. And everything just works. Suddenly, this person has a character. She has wishes, dreams, things she likes and dislikes. Of course it's still a little... dizzy, but my subconsciousness, my psychological body reacts to this.


A small disclaimer though: although I'm talking like I know everything, I don't have any educational background to back this up. This is purely my experience and the terminilogoy is propably grossly misused (sorry!)

2019-12-20 05:06:08,ed5fny,4,1,"So I went out to dinner tonight with my parents, my niece, my Aunt, and her fiancé. He's a MAGA Republican, has Fox News on 24/7 (literally leaves the TV on when he leaves the house so he can have it on when he gets back), and based on previous conversations and things told to me by my cousins, he's a bigot. I met him a few times before, but these were all prior to me starting my transition.

I figured my Aunt must have told him about me. I am totally out, I'm not stealth, I still don't understand how or why I pass in public other than attitude but w/e. If someone is important to me, they know I'm trans. I am not shy about this and I think visibility is important.

So we see them come in the building. I had already decided I was going to be nice for my Aunt's sake and not talk politics. I don't know how she can be with him considering she's quite liberal but she doesn't have the best taste in men in my opinion.

I go to shake the guy's hand. My Aunt sees this and says, ""Oh and this is my niece Eleanor. You haven't met her before."" I'm like.... what? This guy has met me a few times and he's going to recognize me for sure. But I don't say anything about it because I'm confused as to what's going on. This guy isn't the brightest bulb in the socket and makes a comment about me being tall but nothing about knowing me or me being trans. He was clearly annoyed that he was shorter than me.

The guy is oblivious for the rest of the night and he is quite the narcissist. He tried to brag about how good business is (he sells bathrooms) and pretends to take a phone call at the table. I cringed at the bad acting. In the end, I didn't do anything other than eat, make small talk, take care of my niece, and listen to this guy ramble on about the latest Clint Eastwood movie.

But I feel like I messed up. I didn't want things to go badly for my aunt's sake but I feel like I am back in the closet for a totally different reason than before. I passed as cis. Now I don't come out to every single person that I meet because that would be stupid and exhausting. But this guy is apparently going to be an uncle soon and he has no idea that I'm trans. I'm sure my Aunt thought she was probably sparing me from his BS but like I said before, I feel like I messed up in a big way. I have no idea if she, or any of my cousins, plan to tell this guy anything or not. I wish she would have before this visit (they live in NH, I live in FL). If they were to tell him now, that would be fine too. 

I honestly do not care about what anyone thinks of me as far as my gender identity goes and I mean it. I shrug off hate but I rarely encounter any. So what happened tonight? I go and pretend I've never met this guy before. I'm wondering if I was concerned about what he would think of my Aunt if he found out I was trans or if I was just too tired to deal with transphobia tonight. That's the part that has me kicking myself. Either way, this shouldn't be happening and me being trans shouldn't matter at all. It hasn't mattered since I came out. So why did it matter now? Why do I feel bad about this? 

I feel like I put my Aunt's feelings over everything else here. Was that the correct decision?

I think it’s

I’m trans. I’m not here to trick men or any other people.
I’m just here like others looking for connection. 
Most trans people we seek connection. If your objective is to get sex, it’s very likely I’m not the right person. If you’re looking to enjoy the pleasure of people like me secretly. I’m not the right person. I go out, I travel, I danced, I laugh. I live my life on display for the world. And despite some danger I am free. 
I’ve been, done, so many things and traveled to many places. While I desire deep spiritual intimate kindred connection. I don’t desire getting lost in love. I don’t desire people without boundaries. This past year has been the most beautiful year of my life. I journeyed in Peru and discovered this part of me that is sacred and beautiful. And a joy I’ve never felt in my life. So I can never return to the shrinking and hiding myself for some clandestine form of love and partnership. For a hope that I’ll finally be seen. I wish I knew this earlier in life. I like the life I’m building and so my hope is to find partnership that spiritually grounded. That he be grounded in love for himself and his most inner being, so that from that self love there is abundance to them share love. So yeah....You know who you are.

I’m sharing my story if it helps anyone who reads this. 
.
.
Anxiety was a seductive friend. Swooning me. Doting on me, and is find myself in the arms of men to escape it. I’d find myself at parties on weekends to deal.  I’d find myself trying to jump head first into love with random guys. Anxiety was a frenemy. I lived  at a constant 5-6 out of 10 on the scale for anxiety. But I never thought it was my gender so I carried on. 
.
.
I had about of depression senior and freshman. I went from being a big heavyish “ guy” to being pretty thin. This was around the time that I broke up with my first ever boyfriend who I was almost in love with and then ran off to NYC to run through the streets with a guy I thought would also love me. Yeah no. And mama warned me. She said it’s not going to be what you think. But she always has a way of giving you space but also giving you advice. My mother is my heart. My best friend. She’s always been there to set me straight and give me love. 
.
.
And so I went on as “ normal” a “ gay man who was somewhat feminine” but  was sure she wasn’t trans. And so anxiety stuck around. 

It’s not like I actually had a gender dysphoria or it is that the lack of understanding my gender manifested as anxiety and depression and what was stopping from even placing my finger in the source of my anxiety? 

Honestly many things, college, grad school, traveling the world, going to festivals, spending hours at the gym, obsessing over boy after boy, parties, alcohol, cigarettes, casual sex, random hookups. Chasing a PhD, then dropping out of grad school and going for nursing. My lack of understanding of myself manifested as anxiety. Anxiety I thought was normal. I thought my sorrow and lack of fulfillment was normal.  That was just life. 
That was just life. Struggling to find true partnership, never experiencing true liberating intimacy, going from bed to bed in search of self. Every now and then thinking hmmm “ I’m not sure I’m gay or male, maybe I’m something more.”

So I went on. Pretending in someways that I wasn’t falling apart slowly.  

This year it got bad. I was into my second year as a travel nurse. The pay is more than I’ve ever made. I was heading to a 6 week travel abroad in Europe. I was going by myself. I would meet up with friends in Paris. Not many but a good bunch. 

And yet anxiety was smiling behind me. This time it’s like it showed up and stood on my back. I couldn’t sleep, I was crying all the time. My temper was getting bad. I wanted to escape. My sex life was unhealthy and I really didn’t enjoy it. 

So I went to California. Applied for my nursing license and planned to just move away early March. I’d find a nursing contract and Peace out. But no. Some stuff happened with my sister and my mother and I took over the care of my niece. I could leave my mom who had raised eight children and still had my little sister of 12 to raise. So I stuck around. Moved in with my mom. We took care of my niece.

So I get back from Cali and someone said “ hey man what’s up” and it was as if my soul was stepped on. And each time this he pronoun was placed on me I felt like something was ripping my soul apart. My body had and still has this visceral reaction to being labeled with male terms. 

One night I layed in bed and I just cried. I said to myself you can’t be trans it can’t be your gender. Not at 30. But the feeling of dysphoria or incongruence was running circles all through my life. 
It’s strange because I’d always felt feminine but think I ignored it so well, my gender, that I didn’t even think what was bothering me was even my gender at all.

And so I asked the universe to help me. 

And my niece coming was the biggest blessing.  She was the universe stopping me from moving to California. So I stayed back. 

One day in March, while still struggling To understand if I was trans or not. I came across ayahuasca. And overtime I tread tons of reviews and decided to book a trip to Peru ahead of my European trip. 

I was nervous. Ayahuasca is a psychedelic  that causes you to trip. It causes you to have revelations and to deal with your inner darkness. And so despite my fear I payed the money and went. 

I fasted. I cut out drinking cigarettes sex masturbation, Facebook, the gram, porn. I went mostly vegan, vegan meditating and doing something called floating.floating is where you float in complete darkness is this pod like structure filled with epsom salt. Your naked in complete darkness and  you experience total relaxation. So I did all this 1-2 months before my trip to Peru. 

In June after my contracted ended I  flew out of New York into Lima. Went through customs and boarded my connecting flight to Cusco. I was on my way. Excited that I was going to be away from work for six months but nervous because ayahuasca is the most potent psychedelic in the world.  Maybe aside from Iboga (which I don’t think I will ever do).

So to summarize. I arrive in Cusco and I’m driven to the Arkana retreat center. So over the course of the week there are three ayahuasca ceremonies they all happen at night 7pm to 2am. There Various trips and activities we do around the town and in nearby cities. 

One day after we get back from a trip to a nearby market where I bought these beautiful feathered earrings. Carolina ( one of facilitators from Argentina) she comes to me and whispers “ you are a woman”. I smile and say nervously, not me. But she smiles because her spirit knew. Later that day we did a sauna type of activity. There was a door covered with heavy rugs and put in the middle of the dome is a small pit for  hot rocks, before the 12 of us crawled inside we had to put our head to the earth and pray. And then after praying lean up and crawl inside. As I leaned up and crawled in. Fernanda said “welcome sister” and again I was resistant

That night in ayahuasca I journey with this gentle feminine spirit. After fighting with the medicine because for the second time ( we have 3 ceremonies over the course of the week) it wasn’t “ working” i wasn’t connecting with the medicine. And what was really happening was she was breaking down my resistance to the point where I literally said “ fine do what you want” and then I began to connect. 

And the connection is the scariest and most beautiful connection. I felt the earth breathing. I felt the room come alive and this warm comforting way. I was wrapped in the warmth of love. 

I asked “ mother what is love?” And suddenly I was in love with my body, my hair, my lips, the mountains, the stars outside. I layed back on my mat looking up at the darkness and she said to me “ remember this moment carry it with you in your life.” 
And I asked her “ am I trans”? And she said “ you can be what ever you want but yes you are female”  and I layed back and smiled. Under think blankets and the shamans singing the icaros, I fell in love with myself for the first time in my entire life. This deep joy. This joy that I don’t know where or how it Im exists but if you could bottle it bill gates who seem poor. 

This joy settled through my body. Through my spirit. She told me “ it’s okay to be who you are”  and so I journeyed to healing in my last ceremony. And I had some deep messages. She told me I have the gift of clairvoyance/ psychic stuff. She tried to show me darker stuff about myself but wasn’t ready so I chose to remain inside the good lovely place . And I did. The medicine. The mother. She held me. She told me to hold my head up and look at people when I speak. That I deserve love. 

And then the next day was ego death. We smoked a medication called 5 meo DMT and it was instant death of ego. Instant death and then this rebirth. Like every cell, every past m life, my ancestors, was healed.  I layed on the floor and I laughed from this place of pure joy. I had spent my life feeling bad, feeling forgotten, unworthy, trapped, ugly, and this was Pure release. I was experiencing joy from the inside. Playing out was gopala lullaby. And this connection to all beings, to all the trees and plants was happening. Finally after 10 minutes ( it’s a quick trip) I sat up and hugged everyone. I wanted to love everyone. I wanted to just hold the joy inside them and bring it up and out. And then this rush of tears came over me. I had given so much of myself to people and things and ideas and I never asked for anything in return. I never asked for love, I never asked for reciprocity. I never asked to be seen. And I cried from deep in my spirit. I let go of pain that was beyond me. Something I had been likely carrying with me since before this life. 

So from the trip I felt my connection to the divine feminine. I was definitely trans though I did San Pedro cactus and he told me. Parts of me will always be male ok some sense but he was like a loving grandfather. Jolly. Loving. In that experience I felt like a boy at times. San Pedro balances the divine masculine. 

So I left Peru with something beautiful. A gift. A peace. 

I still experienced some hick ups while in Europe but in September I went back to Peru.

I’m not here to trick men or any other people.\nI’m just here like others looking for connection. \nMost trans people we seek connection. If your objective is to get sex, it’s very likely I’m not the right person. If you’re looking to enjoy the pleasure of people like me secretly. I’m not the right person. I go out, I travel, I danced, I laugh. I live my life on display for the world. And despite some danger I am free. \nI’ve been, done, so many things and traveled to many places. While I desire deep spiritual intimate kindred connection. I don’t desire getting lost in love. I don’t desire people without boundaries. This past year has been the most beautiful year of my life. I journeyed in Peru and discovered this part of me that is sacred and beautiful. And a joy I’ve never felt in my life. So I can never return to the shrinking and hiding myself for some clandestine form of love and partnership. For a hope that I’ll finally be seen. I wish I knew this earlier in life. I like the life I’m building and so my hope is to find partnership that spiritually grounded. That he be grounded in love for himself and his most inner being, so that from that self love there is abundance to them share love. So yeah....You know who you are. \n\n661-525-9089\n\nI’m sharing my story if it helps anyone who reads this. \n.\n.\nAnxiety was a seductive friend. Swooning me. Doting on me, and is find myself in the arms of men to escape it. I’d find myself at parties on weekends to deal.  I’d find myself trying to jump head first into love with random guys. Anxiety was a frenemy. I lived  at a constant 5-6 out of 10 on the scale for anxiety. But I never thought it was my gender so I carried on. \n.\n.\nI had about of depression senior and freshman. I went from being a big heavyish “ guy” to being pretty thin. This was around the time that I broke up with my first ever boyfriend who I was almost in love with and then ran off to NYC to run through the streets with a guy I thought would also love me. Yeah no. And mama warned me. She said it’s not going to be what you think. But she always has a way of giving you space but also giving you advice. My mother is my heart. My best friend. She’s always been there to set me straight and give me love. \n.\n.\nAnd so I went on as “ normal” a “ gay man who was somewhat feminine” but  was sure she wasn’t trans. And so anxiety stuck around. \n\nIt’s not like I actually had a gender dysphoria or it is that the lack of understanding my gender manifested as anxiety and depression and what was stopping from even placing my finger in the source of my anxiety? \n\nHonestly many things, college, grad school, traveling the world, going to festivals, spending hours at the gym, obsessing over boy after boy, parties, alcohol, cigarettes, casual sex, random hookups. Chasing a PhD, then dropping out of grad school and going for nursing. My lack of understanding of myself manifested as anxiety. Anxiety I thought was normal. I thought my sorrow and lack of fulfillment was normal.  That was just life. \nThat was just life. Struggling to find true partnership, never experiencing true liberating intimacy, going from bed to bed in search of self. Every now and then thinking hmmm “ I’m not sure I’m gay or male, maybe I’m something more.”\n\nSo I went on. Pretending in someways that I wasn’t falling apart slowly.  \n\nThis year it got bad. I was into my second year as a travel nurse. The pay is more than I’ve ever made. I was heading to a 6 week travel abroad in Europe. I was going by myself. I would meet up with friends in Paris. Not many but a good bunch. \n\nAnd yet anxiety was smiling behind me. This time it’s like it showed up and stood on my back. I couldn’t sleep, I was crying all the time. My temper was getting bad. I wanted to escape. My sex life was unhealthy and I really didn’t enjoy it. \n\nSo I went to California. Applied for my nursing license and planned to just move away early March. I’d find a nursing contract and Peace out. But no. Some stuff happened with my sister and my mother and I took over the care of my niece. I could leave my mom who had raised eight children and still had my little sister of 12 to raise. So I stuck around. Moved in with my mom. We took care of my niece.\n\nSo I get back from Cali and someone said “ hey man what’s up” and it was as if my soul was stepped on. And each time this he pronoun was placed on me I felt like something was ripping my soul apart. My body had and still has this visceral reaction to being labeled with male terms. \n\nOne night I layed in bed and I just cried. I said to myself you can’t be trans it can’t be your gender. Not at 30. But the feeling of dysphoria or incongruence was running circles all through my life. \nIt’s strange because I’d always felt feminine but think I ignored it so well, my gender, that I didn’t even think what was bothering me was even my gender at all.\n\nAnd so I asked the universe to help me. \n\nAnd my niece coming was the biggest blessing.  She was the universe stopping me from moving to California. So I stayed back. \n\nOne day in March, while still struggling To understand if I was trans or not. I came across ayahuasca.

You can operate and take hormones and get surgery's and convince people to call by your preferred pronoun but deep down, for good or for bad you are still male or female at least biologically.

To those that came out this year, I am so so proud of you. You’ve taken that first step into being the person you were born to be. If you’ve lost family or friends my heart truly goes out to you. Don’t let that discourage you. You are valid and are accepted as you are by so many people.

To those who are already deep in their journey, you’re doing an amazing job. You’ve come this far and there’s no stopping you now. Keep being the amazing and beautiful person that you are.

And to those who aren’t transgender but are our allies, thank you so much for supporting our journeys. We love you more than words can say and you’re a truly special person. 

This year has been wild. It’s been up and down and all around. But we’re still here. And we aren’t about to give up yet. Even in your darkest hour, remember these three things;

- You are Loved
- You are Valid

Ever since I graduated high school, everything has felt like I was stuck in life. I managed to come out, but after that, nothing. I have no job, no income, I'm doing terrible in school and already going into debt for it. I have no idea what to do with my life, if there's even a reason I should carry it out in the first place.

I think I have passions, but my motivation to carry them out is so fleeting. I can never seem to want to do things anymore. I got a YouTube channel going, but I missed an upload and I'm worried I won't be able to get anything else done with that because my motivation for it is going down-hill. i started working on a new video game to make, but I've sat here watching YouTube all day instead of working on it like I told myself I'm going to do.

I should probably go into therapy, but I need my medical card for that and I keep forgetting to grab it when the motivation strikes me to get that set up. I'm pretty much homeless, and have no clue what to do to get out of that situation. Even when an opportunity comes my way, I never have the will-power to do anything with that opportunity.

I know I have to do something to get myself out of my own situation, but how do I do that when I never have long-lasting motivation to get myself out of it. The only reason I even get out of what I call a bed is because it's more comfortable to bus to where I can get Wi-Fi and sit on my butt all day doing nothing of importance.

All my dreams, al my passions, they seem bleak and gray, hazed out by the atmosphere I exude. A ray of laughter occasionally pokes through, but it goes away quicker than it shows up.

I lost the one girl I felt truly loved me because she found out that she’s gay before I figured that I’m trans and so now I’m all alone and I just want to be with a girl again. A girl in my area or at least my city. I want to date a girl who’ll love me for me and who’ll cuddle me, kiss me, hold me, etc. I want to wake up next to that girl and cuddle. 
       I’m bisexual, but I swear to God these fucking men are turning me gay. I really just need help. If I can’t find a girl irl, I need help finding wlw online who would date a trans girl. A wlw who lives in Tucson, Arizona.   
      Just someone please tell me how to meet gay girls that would be fine with dating a pre-everything trans girl like me while I go through my transition journey.

I've created a new community, r/ftmsurgeryexperience, for transmen / transmasculine people where they can share their surgery experience with others, find community, and seek information that's hyperlinked into one comprehensive resource, the Surgeon Megalist.

I've created general discussion threads about individual surgeons, facilitated a weekly discussion question, and developed nuanced, thoughtful question about surgery for the community. I've also offered a variety templates for folks that they can use to share their consultations with surgeons, their recovery experiences, and photos of their results.

2019-12-24 00:06:53,eeszrp,0,1,"Sorry in advance about the length. Maybe got a bit ranty.

Hi. I'm 19, ftm, pre-everything. My friend group is large and there are a handful of people in it that identify as trans in some way, and lately I've been having trouble with... bitter thoughts. 

Some info about me: I am out to friends, but am currently unable to come out to family because I'm still dependent, and therefore can't start my medical transition. I can't work due to disability but will hopefully get on welfare, but that can take years, so as for transitioning I'm at a dead end until I can live on my own.
Most of these feelings come from within my inner circle: there are two people who identify as gender fluid and nonbinary respectively. Needless to say I love them wholeheartedly, but whenever they talk about transitioning, I get this uncomfortable sting.
I am insanely jealous that one of them (A) owns a binder. The other (B) has not been out as long, but they have been making huge strides lately in terms of presenting and has had lengthy discussions about their dysphoria.
I am legitimately afraid that B is going to start taking testosterone though. I feel actually, literally sick to my stomach. And A has been talking about surgery and just came out to a supporting family, and I AM happy for them, but still...
I guess I'm jealous because A came out late 2018 and B came out earlier this year and they are both so much further along than me, even though I've known I'm trans since like '12 and have been out since around '16. I feel like I'm missing the boat, and it's not fair because I feel like (I hate to say it) I am more deserving, because I have had to wait for so long, so they should wait for me. Then in turn I just feel guilty, of course.
I KNOW it's irrational, but I can't help it. I really want to get over these thoughts.
And it's a bit unrelated but A keeps tagging me in lesbian memes so I feel like they might not even SEE me as trans... I don't know where this problem originates but I am desperate to get this over with.

TLDR: I'm a trans guy with anti-lgbt parents, and I keep going back and forth between accepting myself and trying to force myself to be a cis woman. I keep trying to find reasons to make the fact that I'm a man seem like I'm faking or confused and it makes me feel invalid.

Okay so, this is my first post on Reddit, and I could really use some advice on how I'm feeling and I want to know if anyone else has dealt with this type of situation.

I'm 17 and ftm, I've always known something was off since- well, as far as I can remember. When I was little I didn't think too much of it aside from those moments where I'd go in my room and cry because I wished I was a boy. I was homeschooled till 5th grade and raised in a very Christian household, I wasn't aware the LGBT+ community even existed until my young teens. Once I found out that it is possible for some people to be born as the wrong gender something in my mind clicked yet I pushed it away and ignored it.

My parent's opinion mattered a lot to me back then, and my sister came out as trans years ago and they did not have a good reaction. It didn't help that my sister isn't actually trans she was just figuring herself out so that just influences my parent's negative thoughts towards trans being a phase or just confusion.

When I was 10 I had my first bad breakdown due to body dysphoria, again, at the time I didn't know being trans was a thing. When I was 14 I identified as a man for the first time, online. It felt so good, I finally felt like me.

But, to me living my life as a male at the time seemed impossible. What will my parents think? What will my siblings think? So I pushed it away again, trying to force myself to be a cis woman yet all that did was bring on more dysphoria. Then the same thing happened at 15, and again at 16, only 16 was different. I cut my hair, I wore some men's clothes (my brother gives me his shirts and sweaters when he grows out of them) I tried to hide my chest, and I was *me.*

I wanted to come out to my sibling at the time, but I knew if I did there would be no going back. The thought that someone would be there and would support me, I knew it meant I would transition and go through with this all.

So I pushed it away again and lived a lie, *again.*

I'm 17 now, almost 18 and I'm terrified. A lot has changed since those experiences and I know I'm a man, and I know what I have to do. I love my parents, but if I have to cut contact with them I will, hopefully they'd come around eventually. I'm done trying to live my life for others, I'm done living a lie.

I'm going to come out to my sister next week. Going to come out to one of my friends probably tonight.

I know I need to come out to someone close to me before I try to push this away again.

But even after all of this I still have these thoughts.

*What if I'm faking it?*

I think the biggest issue for me right now is I think my body is attractive, yet it's not *my* body. I like girls, they're beautiful so when I see my body and ignore the fact that it's *mine* it doesn't look bad. Yet once I accept that this is my body I just feel sick.

My mind is trying to find any sort of reason for me to be faking it, it's trying to find a thing to shove in my face and somehow convince me I'm just pretending or am confused.

I'm terrified of being trans. I hate this, yet the thought of finally transitioning just

It gives me so much hope for the future.

Sorry, this is pretty long and kind of turned into a vent, I just really needed to get this out. I know I'm trans and I will transition yet part of my mind is against me, I guess the part that is still seeking approval from my parents and others.

2019-12-24 19:03:47,ef5kgc,0,1,"A year ago today I went to the movies with my family. We saw Mary Poppins returns. The theater we like to go to is at Disney Springs since we live in Kissimmee. While walking towards the theater, I looked around at all the happy families, I looked at my parents and my niece and how happy they were, and I thought about how I hadn't been happy like that, really ever. I was miserable, I felt like I was spending more time and energy than ever in hiding who I was, and I just wanted to live as the woman that I knew I was. 

The original Mary Poppins was my favorite movie when I was young. We had a VHS copy that got totally worn out from how many times I insisted we watch it. The sequel didn't hold a candle to the original in my opinion, but I sat in the theater and thought about the decisions I'd made in my life. I had attempted to come out before when I was much younger, but not to family. It was always others that had negative reactions. I thought that if I tried to come out to people I wasn't really emotionally attached to, I could work my way up to family. It always went very badly. I resigned myself to the fact that I'd never get to transition and that I would live to try and make those around me happy. This doesn't work for very long.

So that was it. By the time we were walking back to the car I knew that I was going to come out to my family. I had hit my limit, I couldn't live the lie any more. I didn't think I'd get disowned but I was still terrified of what the reaction would be. 

I tried to find the best time to do it. I decided against Christmas day, I didn't want to risk having Christmas associated with my being trans, especially if things went poorly. After Christmas was over, I started pacing around, starting a conversation and then ending it abruptly. It took me until January 5 to finally get it out to my folks. ""I'm transgender."" My parents looked at each other with a look that I can only describe as, ""So THAT'S what's been wrong with her all this time"". They were immediately accepting, I was incredibly lucky. 

Coming out isn't easy. I did the ""rip off the band-aid"" method and let everyone in my family know within 24 hours of coming out to my parents. I haven't spoken to some people since but we never really spoke much before either. Not everyone is going to be accepting.

But here I am, one year later, and it was hands down the best year of my life. My name change hearing is less than 3 weeks away, as is the first day of my new job. I looked at pictures today and the person I was barely resembles me now (even though I still feel I have a long way to go). I've been on HRT for ~9.5 months and I'm taking care of myself in a way I never did before.

Tomorrow is Christmas. Every year of my youth I had dreamed that someone would figure me out and get me a ""girl present"". It never happened. This year, even though my family isn't giving gifts to anyone but my niece, I get the best present of all, which is to be me. 

Wishing a Merry Christmas and Happy holidays to all the trans people out there. I pray your family is as accepting as mine and that you can find the courage to come out and be yourself.",trans,"One year ago today, I decided I was going to come out",1577239427.0,"{'created_utc': 1577214227, 'id': 'ef5kgc', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'A year ago today I went to the movies with my family.

I did the ""rip off the band-aid"" method and let everyone in my family know within 24 hours of coming out to my parents. I haven\'t spoken to some people since but we never really spoke much before either. Not everyone is going to be accepting.\n\nBut here I am, one year later, and it was hands down the best year of my life. My name change hearing is less than 3 weeks away, as is the first day of my new job. I looked at pictures today and the person I was barely resembles me now (even though I still feel I have a long way to go). I\'ve been on HRT for ~9.5 months and I\'m taking care of myself in a way I never did before.\n\nTomorrow is Christmas. Every year of my youth I had dreamed that someone would figure me out and get me a ""girl present"". It never happened. This year, even though my family isn\'t giving gifts to anyone but my niece, I get the best present of all, which is to be me. \n\nWishing a Merry Christmas and Happy holidays to all the trans people out there. I pray your family is as accepting as mine and that you can find the courage to come out and be yourself.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'One year ago today, I decided I was going to come out', 'created': 1577239427.0}"

2019-12-24 23:18:55,ef8oq5,0,1,"Hello.

So.  I've been engaged in a discussion with somebody who helped get me a bit up-to-date with terminology.  


 [https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/ee4jut/do\_you\_think\_youd\_be\_as\_accepting\_of\_lgbtq\_issues/fbysykk/?context=8&amp;depth=9](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/ee4jut/do_you_think_youd_be_as_accepting_of_lgbtq_issues/fbysykk/?context=8&amp;depth=9)   


My understanding, based on this discussion, is that 'Gender' and 'Sex' are not appropriate terms to use to discuss the identity of a Trans individual.

My understanding is that, because Trans individuals need right and recognition NOW, within the context of our current society, they need to immediately be viewed as 'Men' versus 'Women'.  So, my understanding, is that the acceptable terms are 'Man', 'Woman', and 'Person'.

However, doesn't this inherently mean that there is no way to define transgenderism without bringing the words 'Man' and 'Woman' into the discussion?

I mean.  If we can't really say that a trans person is trans because they ""feels that they are the opposite \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that they were born with"", because there is simply nothing appropriate to go in those blanks, then doesn't that...sort of undermine the purpose of viewing Gender and Sex as non-binary? 

If we are using exclusively binary terms to form that definition and discussion, if we are locking society into only being able to define these individuals as either a 'Man' or a 'Woman', and making all other defining words taboo, aren't we also locking out those words that would actually be useful?

As has been pointed out, Gender and Sex ARE ACTUALLY GRADIENTS. Very few people are truly biologically one or the other, there is a great deal of genetic variant in the middle. Societal Gender roles are even more ridiculous, and the combinations of masculine versus feminine traits within any one makeup of personality and upbringing are virtually unlimited.

We all know this.

But if we aren't allowed to discuss Trans people as having a place in either Gender or Sex, don't those discussions sort of... dead-end?

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't get me wrong here, I'll use 'Person', 'Male' and 'Female' if you tell me that's what I'm supposed to use.  I do not want to offend anybody.

But, I just wanna know:

Am I alone in thinking that that's doing more immediate harm than long-term good?

2019-12-25 13:45:58,efgn3a,3,1,"So I was chatting with someone who has for the first time this year played a Dame in a Pantomime. For any of you who aren't aware, Pantos are a very British theatrical style very prominent at Christmas time, generally with fairy tale based plot lines and a cast of comedy caricatures: The love struck fool, the old miser, the naive hero, and the over the top Dame.

The Dame is an over the top, ridiculous costumed and wigged individual who generally doesn't have much of a part to play in progressing the plot line, but interacts heavily with the audience and is overall a bubbly and active character. This character is almost always played my men, and as described by the person I was chatting with, is very much just ""a man in a dress"", and not trying to venture into drag or other communities.

Panto does have a history of crossdressing, back into the Victorian era, with the main male protagonist often being played by a women as well.

The depictions of this Dame type of character will vary from performance to performance, but I was just wondering what the reddit trans community thought of this?

any help on this would be much appreciated, as I've only had the opinions of a few friends so far, and most articles on the subject centre around their usage to treat prostate cancer and other ailments not exactly targeted toward me.

any help on this would be much appreciated, as I've only had the opinions of a few friends so far, and most articles on the subject centre around their usage to treat prostate cancer and other ailments not exactly targeted toward me.

2019-12-27 05:34:08,eg709d,0,1,"This article about an Indian trans organization making plans to erect a university specifically for trans Indians was posted in the transgender subreddit and the response was xenophobic and racist.

India has its own unique history with gender that was disrupted by British colonialism. Just like every other peoples that was colonized by the UK, the gender binary *as we know it*—the gender norms that violently oppress gender nonconformity—is a colonial idea that Indians were violently forced to assimilate to.

That doesn’t mean India didn’t have a gender binary or that gender nonconformity wasn’t persecuted in India before British imperialism. It just means that the way we understand gender, culturally, is not India’s context for gender and indeed Indian people have their OWN historic context that is separate from ours. Comparing trans life in India to trans life in my country is like comparing apples to oranges, and ***it’s not necessary*** for Indian trans liberation.

I am sharing this for two reasons:

1) I want to make it clear that it is unnecessary for you to have an opinion about trans Indian life unless you are a trans Indian. Trans Indians are capable of speaking up for themselves. In the reddit thread, skeptical trans westerners (I assume) who were “concerned about segregation” received double the upvotes than an Indian trans person describing their own reality. What the fuck? That is completely unacceptable. There was an Indian trans person telling us directly that this is a win for trans Indians, but their voice was overshadowed by trans people who have no context for trans life in India, and whose understanding of the history of segregation is obviously limited to a grade school understanding. I see this trend over and over and over again and it’s so fucking racist y’all. Do you really think your high school history education compares to an Indian trans person’s lived experiences?!

2) Some of you are woefully uninformed about the reality of trans lives in your OWN country and you are spreading misinformation that could directly worsen lives that are more vulnerable than yours. The things that are happening in India, Uganda, Japan, Brazil, etc are happening in YOUR country—are you giving that any attention? Do you know your OWN history, your own statistics, your own policy? Are you researching things like “segregation” before you make comparisons to it? Are you researching... anything?! If not, why would you even trust your own uninformed opinion?

Trans people from the UK are experiencing a regression in support for trans rights, and there is a social campaign against their livelihood that is gaining more and more popularity among even supposedly left wing communities.

Trans people from the USA: our gay rights movement started out centering queer youth and sex workers, then was appropriated by middle class cis gays to focus on marriage equality. After marriage equality was won on the federal level, donations to gay rights orgs went down 70%. Queer youth and sex workers still need that money!

Japan is not the only place where trans people might have to be forcibly sterilized to have their gender recognized by the state. Do your research. And just because there is a policy in Japan to be forcibly sterilized doesn’t mean the policy is enforced or in practice. This is a reality that we can only learn about from TRANS JAPANESE people; we cannot read one clickbait article about Japanese trans policy and decide we are informed enough to have an opinion about Japanese trans life. Also, no shade, but Japanese trans people are not dying to murder at anywhere near the frequency trans people are in white colonial countries.

There is no trans person in this world whose liberation depends on us having an uninformed opinion about what it’s like to be trans in their country. Also your own liberation as a trans person will not be borne of ignorance. Do some goddamn research.

**Does anybody know a lot about how smoking affects HRT when it comes to fat redistribution?** Because I am a smoker, and I've read that aside from health concerns (and please don't make this about general health), smoking makes hrt less effective when it comes to juicing you up in the right places. But it's hard to find any real answers, since HRT is also associated with more general health concerns in menopausal women for instance, and of course for trans women (which is not what I wanna talk about btw)  and information among trans women is usually anecdotal.

Considering that I'm on hrt, and there's still some fat redistribution going usually even after two years, is it likely that I'll gain some weight, and plump up in the right places if I quit smoking now?

I am 38 and didn't realize I was a woman until my mid thirties.  I have a wife and kids and haven't started on any hormones.  I'm partially in the closet as only my three best friends know the real me.  My wife partially knows but doesn't know I'm trans.  She just thinks I like crossdress here and there.  I've tried to come out to her once and failed epically, I got scared of losing her and the kids and I back tracked.

Anyway, lately I've been feeling a lot more dysphoria about not getting to be the real me, again mostly from losing my wife and kids.  However the last few months have been extremely hard.  I live in a state that has informed consent and have a planned Parenthood very close to me that does gender affirming hormone therapy.  

There have been times recently where I just want to go and start hrt and deal with the consequences later.  Luckily my brain kicks in and realizes that wouldn't be the smart thing to do and it would be very insensitive and hurtful to my wife, which is the last thing I want to do!

Taking away that fear for a moment I have another fear that I need advice on.  Unfortunately God decided to put me in the wrong body AND TO BOOT decided to make me extremely hairy except for my head.  I can deal with laser hair removal for my face and body, not sure I can financially support it but I know it's an option.  What I can't do is make my hair on my head grow anymore.

I've read that on hrt, male pattern baldness stops and keeps you from losing any more hair, but doesn't cause it to grow back either.  So my hairline is receding a bit but not too bad.  The part that's been causing me the dysphoria is a circular spot on the very top of my head.  No matter how long I let my hair grow (which isn't very long at all) that spot never seems to grow anymore than the length of a buzz cut.

Have any of you older girls had this problem? Did any of those hair growth products work?  As much as I like wigs I'd much rather have my own head of hair and scared that if I take this jump to hormones that I'll be stuck with wigs 🙁 

I also fear that approaching 40 that it's going to be too late for me to transition.  I heard the younger you do it the more feminine your features become and the later you do the less feminine your features are.

Also, a bit of background on myself. I'm 24 that lives full time as a male. I've crossdressed in secret as long as I can remember and never told anyone (except for my male sexual partners, though it was less telling and more showing). I think I thought I was a sissy until just recently, but now I'm starting to think I may be trans. Also, I currently live in Japan and teach English. Anyway, here is the post:

Having returned home for the holidays and being the victim of jet lag, I've had a lot of down time to just think about my life. I know I wrote a post a few weeks ago, but with this time to think I'm starting to reconsider where I stand with a lot of what I said. I said that I fall somewhere between being trans and being a guy, but what if I'm not. What if I'm actually trans? I can't help but think that I've been fairly unhappy all of my life even though I've really got no reason to be and this line of thinking led me to the conclusion that maybe that's because I'm living a lie.

If I'm being honest, I don't really know what is true and what is not, but on the occasions I've daydreamed or fantasized about being a girl for the rest of my life, I do feel more excited for that future than my current one. The idea of being pretty, walking around in a dress, having long hair that brushes my shoulders; all of those things sound really exciting to me.

I've done a lot of reading about Trans people recently and a lot of stories that pop up, are stories that I think I can relate to. There's a lot of talk about people knowing they were different from an early age. This definitely fits me. I've been dressing as long as I can remember and there are a number of, shall I say, discrepancies between the way I felt about a lot of things, compared to the way that my friends felt about things. I think what I am realizing now, is that I misdiagnosed the differences between all of us. I originally thought that the differences between us were political. I grew up around a lot of conservatives and thought that my more liberal views paved the way between me basically ditching my old high school friends. But now I think I'm realizing that maybe the reason for this fracture was not what I originally thought because I do still enjoy them as people, even though we have wildly varying views. I think what it was, was that they were men comfortable in their identity of being men, whereas I was unsure of myself so I distanced myself from them so that they wouldn't find out about me.

And this extends to my current reluctance and inability to really forge friendships with males or even just friendships in general. I don't want to let anyone too close because they might see the real me, even though I don't think I'm ready to see that 'me' yet. Because that realization is very scary. Say, I do finally realize I'm trans -- then what? Then starts the whole process of telling the people I care about and all of the pain and stuff that goes with that. I just don't know if it's worth it.

I guess I'm at a crossroads and don't know what to do. Am I trans? I'm starting to think I might be. But then what is next? I think I need to formulate a plan. Because unfortunately, my gender identity issues are not the only ones in my life. There are still issues of work, money, student loans and all the other nonsense that comes with being an adult. For one, I think that if I want to truly find this stuff out about myself, I can't do it in Japan. Between the language barrier and my job, I don't think I can manage it.

So that leaves me with moving back to the US and finding a job and place to live. I think what makes the most sense is to live by myself (in a cheap place) and find a job where I can work from home.

“But how do you know?”

I don’t. No reasonable person should ever claim to know anything. However, with as much certainty as is possible I believe that I am a woman. Sure, I have a beard and an unsightly growth from which I urinate, but I am a woman. If memories are to be trusted, when I was four years old, I was convinced that I would grow the body of a woman. I did not have the linguistic capacity to communicate this, but I “knew” I was a woman. Having realized the truth of my birth assignment, I first asked if was possible to change your body’s “sex” around the ages of five and six. When I first began to experience lucid dreams at seven, I would purposefully change my dream body into that of a woman. Despite this knowledge of myself, there was no communicating that to my family. I was, even at such a young age, learning the brutal art of repression. It is that repression that led to denial that took twenty-one years of my life. 

“But what do you mean you are a woman?”

I don’t know. Just like anything else so qualitative, there is no good answer. The best I can describe my experience is by using moral terminology. Although this is not the experience of my fellow trans men and women, it is less a matter of “is” and more a matter of “should”. Referring again to my childhood, I believed that I would grow into a beautiful woman because all children tend to believe that should implies will. Every glance in the mirror, every shuffle of the pants, every time I am present in the body I have feels as if I was witnessing a sin, a wretch, an abomination. I know what should be, and I know what is. That is, as far as one can know anything. There is a disconnect between these two concepts. Take comfort in the fact that even I do not have a solid answer, not every question can be answered. However, if you have the patience, many trans men and women have posited some fascinating answers.

“Can’t you just not transition”

If you ask a straight, cisgender man if they could live without their penis, the answer is, likely, no. That is how I feel about transitioning. I need to be who I should be, or who I am. Prior to my hatching a month and a half ago, I could not imagine a future in which I would want to take part in. Now, the future is, while scary and unknown, bright and joyous. I have never had such a vigor for life and I still don’t have access to the resources and safety I need. Just letting myself know what I know is bliss compared to the denial of the fundamentals of my being. This is not a choice in the same way that eating is not a choice. Sure, I can delay it and I could distract myself. Someday, however, ignoring this need will kill me.

“Why do I need to use YOUR preferred pronouns?”

If I need to explain decency, you may need to see a psychologist. In all seriousness, there is nothing I can say but listen. Look and listen at the person you are talking too, who is that? You will create a representation of them in yourself. Problem is, they will also have an identity they operate themselves under. This identity is complicated and fundamental to our subjective existences, it is created by a process entirely out of their control. Denying them of their identity is so much worse than you can conceptualize. There is no adequate comparison to give to someone that could truly allow them to know what it is like to have to constantly be fighting for their basic identity. Words are so much than we tend to give them credit for. Consider this, we often define personhood by the ability to communicate within and outside of the entity. We form our realities around words and their concepts. Our language games are as much a part of us as our ability to see of feel pain.

“Why are you so sensitive about all of this”

Why does an African American cringe at the sound of some honkey using outdated slang? Why would an immigrant get on edge whenever immigration discussions happen? Why would a rape victim have to leave the room when a comedian makes jokes about assault? Human’s emotional “sensitivities” are dependent on background and stakes. If in the past, every time someone called you something it was coupled with contempt and disgust, that hurts. The stakes are also important to understand. A culture of racism caused slavery to persist in our inflated prisons, our culture of sexism has kept women from being heard and receiving justice, our anti-immigrant culture has destroyed families. In a similar way, the culture surrounding us GSRMs has led to suicides and depression through mechanisms that must be experienced to be understood. To be told you are not who you are or to have your nature degraded as sinful is so so so destructive.

No reasonable person should ever claim to know anything. However, with as much certainty as is possible I believe that I am a woman. Sure, I have a beard and an unsightly growth from which I urinate, but I am a woman. If memories are to be trusted, when I was four years old, I was convinced that I would grow the body of a woman. I did not have the linguistic capacity to communicate this, but I “knew” I was a woman. Having realized the truth of my birth assignment, I first asked if was possible to change your body’s “sex” around the ages of five and six. When I first began to experience lucid dreams at seven, I would purposefully change my dream body into that of a woman. Despite this knowledge of myself, there was no communicating that to my family. I was, even at such a young age, learning the brutal art of repression. It is that repression that led to denial that took twenty-one years of my life. \n\n“But what do you mean you are a woman?”\n\nI don’t know. Just like anything else so qualitative, there is no good answer. The best I can describe my experience is by using moral terminology. Although this is not the experience of my fellow trans men and women, it is less a matter of “is” and more a matter of “should”. Referring again to my childhood, I believed that I would grow into a beautiful woman because all children tend to believe that should implies will. Every glance in the mirror, every shuffle of the pants, every time I am present in the body I have feels as if I was witnessing a sin, a wretch, an abomination. I know what should be, and I know what is. That is, as far as one can know anything. There is a disconnect between these two concepts. Take comfort in the fact that even I do not have a solid answer, not every question can be answered. However, if you have the patience, many trans men and women have posited some fascinating answers.\n\n“Can’t you just not transition”\n\nIf you ask a straight, cisgender man if they could live without their penis, the answer is, likely, no. That is how I feel about transitioning. I need to be who I should be, or who I am. Prior to my hatching a month and a half ago, I could not imagine a future in which I would want to take part in. Now, the future is, while scary and unknown, bright and joyous. I have never had such a vigor for life and I still don’t have access to the resources and safety I need. Just letting myself know what I know is bliss compared to the denial of the fundamentals of my being. This is not a choice in the same way that eating is not a choice. Sure, I can delay it and I could distract myself. Someday, however, ignoring this need will kill me.\n\n“Why do I need to use YOUR preferred pronouns?”\n\nIf I need to explain decency, you may need to see a psychologist. In all seriousness, there is nothing I can say but listen. Look and listen at the person you are talking too, who is that? You will create a representation of them in yourself. Problem is, they will also have an identity they operate themselves under. This identity is complicated and fundamental to our subjective existences, it is created by a process entirely out of their control. Denying them of their identity is so much worse than you can conceptualize. There is no adequate comparison to give to someone that could truly allow them to know what it is like to have to constantly be fighting for their basic identity. Words are so much than we tend to give them credit for. Consider this, we often define personhood by the ability to communicate within and outside of the entity. We form our realities around words and their concepts. Our language games are as much a part of us as our ability to see of feel pain.\n\n“Why are you so sensitive about all of this”\n\nWhy does an African American cringe at the sound of some honkey using outdated slang? Why would an immigrant get on edge whenever immigration discussions happen? Why would a rape victim have to leave the room when a comedian makes jokes about assault? Human’s emotional “sensitivities” are dependent on background and stakes. If in the past, every time someone called you something it was coupled with contempt and disgust, that hurts. The stakes are also important to understand. A culture of racism caused slavery to persist in our inflated prisons, our culture of sexism has kept women from being heard and receiving justice, our anti-immigrant culture has destroyed families. In a similar way, the culture surrounding us GSRMs has led to suicides and depression through mechanisms that must be experienced to be understood. To be told you are not who you are or to have your nature degraded as sinful is so so so destructive.\n\nPlease, it’s time to set our arrogance aside and listen to the people who are suffering and dying while you keep “just asking questions” that have been used to deflect real progress.

Now dont get me wrong, I'm pretty open to saying if I like the person BUT I knew shit was about to go down. I tried to Google what to do, what to expect but it just gave me images of enlarged clits and talking about how loads of people break up due to fights about it.

I wore lots of ""girly"" makeup, grew my hair long, wore lots of feminine outfits to try and make them feel more like a man.

Yet i wanted to rip myself to shreds every. Single. Day. He couldn't understand that. 
I was told that because I'm conventionally beautiful, that I must be fine. He was wrong.

2019-12-28 18:26:45,egu6lq,2,1,"Hi everyone!

I'm a cis woman and I have a friend who's just beginning her transitioning journey. She's just talked to her parents about getting some surgical procedures and hormone replacement therapy in 2020 and they've agreed to help her as much as they can financially and emotionally. She just got her paycheck and wants to throw a huge pre-New Year's Eve party to celebrate the beginning of her transitioning journey.

Here's the thing, she's entrusted me and only me with going shopping with her and doing her makeup so she could ""pass as much as possible"" for the day of her party. I've tried to ask her what kind of look she's trying to go for, and what kind of clothes she feels would have her ""pass"" but she refuses to give me any real pointers. She ""just trusts me"" and wants to look ""just like me"". She wants me to give her a full makeover.

However, as a cis woman, I really have no idea how to help her pass. I don't think about looking like my gender when I dress. I've never had to think about what would make me look like a woman since I always look like a woman no matter what I wear. My friend has been getting increasingly stressed and fearful of what other people will think of her and how she looks when the big day arrives. It's gotten so bad, she full on throws up sometimes just at the thought of looking too manly and being judged at her own party.

It truly hurts and breaks my heart to see her this way and not knowing how to help her aside from giving general moral support. But eventually (as in, two days from now (I've tried postponing shopping-day as much as I could)), I'm gonna have to give her the full makeover she's always dreamed of without any idea of what I'm doing. I regret not posting here sooner... How can I help her feel her best at her own party? How can I help her ""pass""? I'm terrified of giving her a makeover that she won't be happy with and causing her the pain that she's been dreading. What if someone at her party makes a passive-aggressive comment about her outfit or makeup? What if someone misgenders her by accident? It'll be all my fault. I don't know what to do, what to pick for her, how to make her feel confident. So I'm coming to this subreddit to ask for help and hopefully some answers to all these questions.

Thank you in advance for any responses. I might have to delete this post eventually because this friend of mine tends to browse through this subreddit a lot. I hope this doesn't go trending and I hope that she's too busy preparing for her party to come across this post.

2019-12-28 21:58:57,egwxin,9,1,"I've been out as a transwoman for a few months now, and apart from some issues with my family my day to day life has improved dramatically. Until last week I didn't have any trans friends though, so I popped to my local LGBT foundation and joined a group. Met a translady there who invited me for a night out yesterday.   


I was super excited, make up was on point, got all dressed up in new clothes and bootheels I got for Christmas. Unfortunately when I arrived it turned out she had gone out early because she was bored and was already very drunk. She had to go and I was stuck with her friends... who she had met that day. And then soon after two of them had to go early too.   


So I was left with the only other person who had arrived at a similar time to me, a lesbian from London who wanted to check out the local gay village (I'm from Manchester). Neither of us knew each other but we'd both come for a night out and we agreed to go for it together.   


What followed was one of the most amazing nights I'd ever had. We had a conversation about queerness that I'd needed for a while. She assured me that she saw me unequivocally as a woman and the way everyone treated me all night reinforced this. Complimented by other women in the loos, hit on by a lesbian, and met a few more trans people. She even convinced me to come with her to Vanilla, which is a lesbian bar - this being Manchester I knew I shouldn't have been worried, but I was terrified before going in. Everyone was lovely to me in there though.   


Unfortunately, it all went wrong when she decided to go home. I was pretty tired myself (and very drunk!) so I was gonna get a taxi. But these two lads came up to me and were very complimentary and charming. Being naive I fell for it and when they suddenly disappeared I realised they had pickpocketed my purse and phone. Immediate emotional crash, and in the midst of my panic some guy pulled up next to me and tried to solicit me as a prostitute. After such an amazing night it was like hitting a brick wall.   


Fortunately the Village Angels sorted me out, dealt with my panicking, drunk crying self in a lovely manner and got me home in a police car.  I can't thank them enough.   


I learned a couple of things last night. I love myself, and I love living as a woman. I already knew this - my life has just been better since I started presenting as myself and I'm generally happier, but last night was really special. I have never felt so legitimised. But I had a very rude awakening about safety and looking after myself.

Until last week I didn't have any trans friends though, so I popped to my local LGBT foundation and joined a group. Met a translady there who invited me for a night out yesterday.   \n\n\nI was super excited, make up was on point, got all dressed up in new clothes and bootheels I got for Christmas. Unfortunately when I arrived it turned out she had gone out early because she was bored and was already very drunk. She had to go and I was stuck with her friends... who she had met that day. And then soon after two of them had to go early too.   \n\n\nSo I was left with the only other person who had arrived at a similar time to me, a lesbian from London who wanted to check out the local gay village (I'm from Manchester). Neither of us knew each other but we'd both come for a night out and we agreed to go for it together.   \n\n\nWhat followed was one of the most amazing nights I'd ever had. We had a conversation about queerness that I'd needed for a while. She assured me that she saw me unequivocally as a woman and the way everyone treated me all night reinforced this. Complimented by other women in the loos, hit on by a lesbian, and met a few more trans people. She even convinced me to come with her to Vanilla, which is a lesbian bar - this being Manchester I knew I shouldn't have been worried, but I was terrified before going in. Everyone was lovely to me in there though.   \n\n\nUnfortunately, it all went wrong when she decided to go home. I was pretty tired myself (and very drunk!) so I was gonna get a taxi. But these two lads came up to me and were very complimentary and charming. Being naive I fell for it and when they suddenly disappeared I realised they had pickpocketed my purse and phone. Immediate emotional crash, and in the midst of my panic some guy pulled up next to me and tried to solicit me as a prostitute. After such an amazing night it was like hitting a brick wall.   \n\n\nFortunately the Village Angels sorted me out, dealt with my panicking, drunk crying self in a lovely manner and got me home in a police car.  I can't thank them enough.   \n\n\nI learned a couple of things last night. I love myself, and I love living as a woman. I already knew this - my life has just been better since I started presenting as myself and I'm generally happier, but last night was really special. I have never felt so legitimised. But I had a very rude awakening about safety and looking after myself. Despite not yet making any physical changes, I am more vulnerable now than I was before and I need to be far more careful, even in spaces I consider safe like the village.   \n\n\nTL;DR: Amazing affirming night ruined by a robbery at the end.

I'm an 18y/o from the UK

So for a few years I've been tossing around the idea that I may be trans and I'm feeling really confused about it because, when i first started thinking about it, i was wary. Then I eventually become more confident in my feelings and i was positive i was trans. However through this process I have definitely became wary again as the transitioning process is kinda a scary one and I've never realised how stressful, expensive and painful it sounds. I've told some friends and my only sibling but coming out to my parents seems harder, and then my work and my college friends seem another level entirely as they don't really know my personal life like that.

i think I'm mainly worried that i might tell everyone and then what if i turn out to be wrong and i regretted being the opposite gender and what if i had gotten surgery and it was too late to turn back, i hear theres a lot of transitional remorse and high suicide rates due to regret(is that true?). 

Am I over thinking this?

I've been struggling with the decision of how to relate to my experience of gender. Four years ago I had an experience on LSD that made me realize I was femme; I felt completely like a women for about 30 seconds while looking in the mirror. Since that experience I've know I'm trans and have been able to see all the signs throughout my childhood. I do feel as though I'd be happier as a cis women. The thing is I don't get significant dysphoria. I do feel weird and sometimes dissociate mildly when misgendered but fortunately my close friends/chosen family and most of my co-workers all see me as me and use my pronouns and name. I went on 1mg estrodial 2X daily no spiro for a week once. After about a week of HRT I had an LSD experience (I trip 2-3 times a year as a way to connect deeper with my subconscious and do challenging self reflection and healing work) and during that experience I felt significant dysphoria for a while that turned into euphoria when I came to the conclusion that my body is a queer body regardless of how it looks. At that point I decided to pause HRT as I figure out how I connect to my gender more and figure out an intentional next step rather. I needed a next step which is why I started HRT but realized I had put enough thought into it prior to starting to be ready for it. I could live my entire life without transitioning at all; I don't feel i have enough dysphoria for it to be a need. I would feel more euphoric if I was more regularly read as femme by strangers. I just don't know if my quality of life would be better with the safety of being able to cis pass and not have the financial burden of transitioning or if my quality of life would be better being read as femme but being clocked as trans easily and having to invest the money into transitioning. If we lived with a different social structure where being trans was more acceptable and money wasn't ad tight I definitely would transition. I do acknowledge though that our social structures and my finances do affect my quality of life and I need to take them into consideration.

2019-12-29 18:38:57,eh9jr0,3,1,"As a closeted-trans girl I think Life is really terrible....

  
I'm 17 and I've been in closet since 3 years ago and dysphoria really sucks, I could handle it at times and everything but It's never like It's gone always It's there.

  
I've noticed a pattern basically Winter for me It's worst time of year for Dysphoria.  
I don't know weather It's hormonal by puberty or It's just the time of the year but my Dysphoria is top peak in Winter, starts around October then gradually gets worse and worse until I can't really hold it anymore.  
I live with parents and we don't have many relatives and I'm not close with any of my cousins, in fact I only know 2 of my cousins I don't know how many I have. At around 12 I was really close with many friends and wasn't going good with girls cause I looked like trash and I was probably the dumbest kid ever, i couldn't even say a word without the girls making fun of me. Then I found multiple friends who were nice to me and I've had a crush on them. 

I never said It but we would sit together at late hours and I've always wanted to kiss the boy and see how It feels, at the same time I wanted to also kiss a girl and see how It feels. I asked myself maybe I was just gay? but I heavily declined that cause I didn't feel like I was gay. 

So I guess puberty hit me and I stopped going with them, found new friends at school and I was very happy with them. After 9th grade (school system works different here) i started to High School. Now here's the first real signs and thoughts I've had. I've always had problems improperly walking I don't know exactly what caused it but I went and had a surgery, before the surgery they asked me weather my legs had hair and I didn't know.. that's how much I was innocent then my dad bought a cream and I basically put it there and washed the cream off and my hairs fell off. 

I didn't mind having no hairs but later that night I was laying in bed trying to sleep and I was touching my legs and I really never felt better in my life cause they were so smooth... surgery went good and It was difficult 3-4 months I couldn't walk at all. After that I saw some hairs grow about my lips and then one night I saw my mom waxing so I asked her to wax mine cuz It looked ugly. She agreed. 

I waxed and I felt really nice about it being smooth. Some time after that I wanted to look cute as a girl, i was looking at Instagram and Facebook girls and I was jealous at them. After some time I found out about Youtube Trans Channels and I watched the documentaries about Trans Girls and I found out a channel called Hannah Phillips and I could relate extremely. I never felt like I've wanted to be a Girl so much. 

I couldn't really hold it and I was in a Discord server, told everyone in the Chat, which they really respected me previously and I was liked by them. I told them and I felt really nice. I went on to growing my hair out which I really found interesting, I was still dumb at that time, I grew it really bad and It was all mixed curly and like left and right, basically awkward stage but on steroids, was being made fun at school and I was really sad but I kept growing it. 

One day I couldn't handle it cause It was truly out of control and my dad after many attempts convinced me to go and take a hair cut, I thought I would look decent but he got me to a male barber which had 0 experience and made my hair 10 times shittier and uglier. I was so disappointed and after some time I had another haircut and I got my hair short. 

I was really happy even as male to look decent for 1st time and thought maybe It would just go away and I can live normally. People were generally more accepting and happy I cut it. Well time passed and I wasn't really happy but I was too busy with school and I couldn't really care about myself much. Now since beginning I've experienced Peak Dysphoria at beginning then It fell down but always had that 'thought' and 'jealousy' towards Girls that I thought It would just go away and I'd be normal. 

Well after surviving first dysphoria attack, now I'm at the 2nd one (big attacks) I've always had mini-attacks but now I'm 100% confident there's no going away from this. I'm fully confident and 100% sure I'm gonna either transition into girl or just end it all, no other options. I just started growing my hair out again and I'm styling it as much as possible I've also found out about Hair Gel which is really helpful to make it and shape it the way I want.

I constantly get feelings that I'll never be girl but I have to say Reddit has helped me I go through many Reddits and It's really helpful. I've always been weak IRL and I'm really proud of that. Recently at my peak of dysphoria I tried my mom clothes, leggings, dresses and I'm really proud of that. I'm also not hiding my feelings anymore next time I buy clothes I'm not gonna buy male ones either unisex or female cuz I'm done with pretending I'm different person.

I also use my mom's foundation clearly and wax my eyebrows and I'm making really not into girls and getting feelings about dating boys but I get reminded It's too early. I don't know how to come out so I'm slowly dropping hints to my parents and everyone, like recently my mom hugged me and told me I smell really nice and asked which perfume I use and I told hers and my dad.

Then she told me I'm a boy and I can't use girls perfume and I said ok but Inside I told myself I'll keep using it and she offered to give me money to buy a new perfume for myself but even If she does I'll buy girls ones and just disagree If she says I can't use it, even If she hates it I still will do everything to use it.

I've been times suicidal too but I still want to live and I get confident because of seeing all the transgender people in this community transition. Now school finished and It's school break for christmas and I wish I could wear a dress but I can't really. I have really always wanted to wear Leggings but I can't and I might buy one sooner or later Idc I'm into leggings so much I've always wore my mom's under my clothes and I just can't hold my feelings anymore.

I think the reasons for this sudden change of personality and confidence is maybe my testosterone (my biggest enemy) increasing in value as I'm 17 and half. I'm really anxious but when I look in my mirror I think I can make a decent girl.. I've been looking into HRT for months and months but I looked only via Doctors and now I'm thinking about doing it myself If I can't come out or get it officially via a doctor. I'm 17 and In my country It's unusual at this time to get Job so I probably would need 1-2 years to just get a Job which would pay 230-250 euros and I can spend the 100-130 euros for HRT and rest for living in my parents house. I don't honestly know what to do anymore.

My life is utter garbage. It takes 1.5 hour of shaving and 30 mins of waxing face and eyebrows. It takes so much effort just for still to be called a ""boy"". I don't even pay for school launch just to save enough money to buy Wax Strips and Razors. In my country ""Macedonia"" It's really difficult to find any Doctors to do any surgeries, give HRT... I HONESTLY CAN'T SAY WHAT I SHOULD DO.

I'm too scared to come out to my parents in fear of disappointing them or making them angry, they were never open towards Transgender People but If I keep living like this I'm just gonna get more depressed and anxious and the more I wait the more I wanna just cut myself, which is another thing I'm scared off so I'm thinking of injections as easier way to die...

I'm honestly lost in a country with no help, no support, no one knowing how I feel, nothing. Just dying inside while people don't know anything. I can't hold my feelings and I think my next logical step is just being myself and buying female clothes, growing hair out, waxing eyebrows, shaving my entire body, doing everything possible hopefully for my parents or like something to happen so I can come out without me telling them first instead of like them asking me indirectly about it. I'm scared of never being to transition properly and never getting surgeries. I just need help from them, even tho I know they probably even afford the HRT I need. Not sure If HRT is even sold here, or covered by insurance.

I have been dealing with male pattern baldness, tried finasteride which gave me terrible pain on my genitals, so I had to quit.

There seems to be an another option though, RU58841, which I think clogs the androgen receptors and therefore prevent androgen damage. 

However there are a lot of rumors saying that it might cause heart failure because it prevents androgens from strengthening the heart muscles. 

So as a person who had misaligned eyes as a kid due to weak eye muscles (got surgery) and had innocent heart murmurs, again, when I was a kid. 

So I am kind of scared that it might mess me up, the problem is that RU58841 never got on market, therefore doesn’t have the approval of the FDA and has only two studies on it as far as I know.

I never particularly hated my feminine features, but I always thought to myself ""hell, I'd be pretty happy without breasts"". I often wished to myself that I could be one of the guys.

The feeling subsided for a bit and I basically ignored my feelings for years, I was unhappy and depressed but i always thought it was unrelated. I told myself I was just a masculine bisexual woman, nothing strange about that, right? Well, I am starting to think that I was wrong.

I've noticed a thing about myself as well. Whenever I daydream, I, or the character I make up for myself, is male. Always.

2019-12-29 22:00:22,ehc973,2,1,"Hi folks,

So I work for an afterschool program for high school students and have a student who is trans. I need help and advice on not only how to support them, but on language use. I'm a cisgender male in his late 30s and while I am confident in how to support them in a general sense, a recent incident made me realize I am lacking some knowledge.

The incident went something like this: some of the student's friends where joking around and apparently made some cracks about the student's gender. This was brought to my attention by another student and so I quite assertively informed the joking students that that behaviour isnt tolerated at all. 

The thing of it is, while I was telling them that we respect gender differences, I found something to the effect of ""we honour *their choice*"" on the tip of my tongue. I recognized that this was not the language I would use if I was speaking about sexual orientation or ethnicity so I pulled back, but found myself struggling for the right language to use at that moment. I did follow up with them after and they appreciated that I spoke up, and they were okay with how things worked out.

I've been reflecting on this for awhile and have realized that honestly (and obviously), I don't understand what it means to be transgendered. I did not grow up with trans people, in fact, despite being open and accepting of the LGBT+ community, I grew up with views still rooted transphobia. While my views have grown and evolved of the years, I still don't know how to address the issue as an ally. I am not one to speak on behalf of a community I don't belong to but find myself in a position where I am an authority figure who has to not only ensure that all my students feel they belong, but also model the values that support that belonging. I don't want to kick out the offending students, I want them to learn and grow.

I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask, and it won't be my only place, but I would appreciate your help as a community. I am hoping to ask some questions that are... uninformed, but will not cause offense. 

What language should I use when discussing people transitioning?

The youth has not undergone and medical interventions to my knowledge. They simply asked to be referred to with neutral pronouns and wanted to be called by a masculine name. Does this matter? How do I speak about it in a broader sense that applies to all trans people?

Are there things that well-intentioned people have done that exacerbate problems?

It made me feel good but now that we are split, doesn\'t matter if you\'re Obama telling me I\'m beautiful, I just can\'t love myself like I\'m suppose to. I look in the mirror and i want to pick myself apart. People say my acne isnt that bad and that I could tone my body a little but that overall I\'m very pretty...it just isn\'t where I pictured myself. Did love blind me and make me ugly? Probably. Am I depending on him to validate myself? Yeah...and I shouldn\'t. I\'m fully aware that this is toxic. \nSo after the break up, I rushed to CVS and bought all the skincare items I could see, i started not eating a lot again and I\'ve used laxatives in all my drinks(not a good idea..I\'m dumb). I pull my hair out when I\'m stressed and you wanna know what I\'m doing tomorrow?? Cutting my hair super short to avoid pulling it out. I want to change up my look (typical for a girl after she went through a break up) but is it for me or is it because I want him to notice? Probably. \nAm I still searching for that validation he gave me? Yeah. \nBut the thing is- for the girls or guys out there reading this....when you\'re with them, and even after you guys split, the truth is that you\'re going to try your best to ""show them you\'re still worth it""...but the thing is, sometimes you don\'t need to do that. You need to do what YOU want to do. And I think it\'s about time I take my own advice.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Another installment of dating a transitioning person ....but POV is from the girlfriend:)', 'created': 1577693750.0}"

    THE WRATH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
    by Molossus Spondee
    
    It is almost like a man
    a rotten starving man
    
    Limping, shaking, crippled, crawling,
    The horrid thing, stinking filth
    Shudders down the city streets
    Down at the break of dawn
    
    And with its wicked strength,
    All things it knocks aside
    Blind, unseeing
    The rats about which run and hide
    
    To the root it goes, to the city's center
    And fat from the city pours
    Fear of it's boiling wrath
    Enough the streets to crush and render
    
    From on high the newsmen watch
    Entranced in fear and shock
    How mighty must it once have been?
    This thing that struggles now to walk
    
    It should rage and shout
    Should - if sickness sound had not forgot
    It rages
    Silent as the empty streets surround
    
    At red dusk - smoggy, tired, nervous hot
    It plods on, in it's slow tired pace
    To the city centre - full up of
    Cigarettes and needles, trash and embers
    
    It finds a fallen street pole
    It stoops to lift the cudgel
    It lifts, tendons stretched taught
    It lifts - and stops, falls - on old pains caught
    
    From icy chills and sweat
    It boils fever fire hot
    It stoops
    And lifts, it's club again
    
    With it's mighty club it strikes
    And all the earth it shakes
    And in seventy pieces tears

For some context, I have a friend that I met freshman year of college, and we were project partners for two classes. I tell this story about how I would have failed both those classes if this friend hadn’t carried me on those projects. I told this story several times throughout school and still sometimes during random conversations. We’ve since graduated and lost touch for the most part. This friend came out a couple years ago, and we’ve shared a couple short messages on social media but I’ve since quit using Facebook so no real communication anymore. 

Since I can’t really ask her as it would feel weird leading with this question, I figured I’d get an opinion from the trans community.

If someone were to tell a story or share a memory they had of you (without you being there) from before you came out, would it be correct or preferred to use your preferred pronouns or name since you came out or would you be okay with them referring to you with your old pronouns or deadname since the memory occurred when you still went by them, or don’t really care either way?

2019-12-30 16:59:33,eholi3,13,1,"Okay 

so recently I've been waxing my eyebrows trying to get that girly look   
but It's not like this is my first time   
I've been doing it for months just less strength 

and basically since my anxiety got really high recently  
I started doing it a lot more 

and more aggressive   
and I got to a shape I pretty much am happy/decently happy with 

I got to a decent shape I like and It was all good, today we took a school winter picture with everyone that was in the  
class at the time  
and I think I was doing fine  
compared to 2 years ago  

and I was pretty proud and everything

then I come back home and I'm chilling and watching YT/Scrolling Reddit and listening music  
then around 2:25 my dad and another friend of his come and they bring packs of foods n everything for tomorrow (cuz we'll celebrate christmas as two families) 

then my mom at 2:30 and she was very happy n everything and there's the other guy sitting on the couch and she looked in my eyes and asked what's wrong with my eyebrows, what did I do  
then I told her ""what do you mean, what's wrong with them?"" 

and then she got really angry and tried to embarrass me to the guy that come (which I'll have to be with and his wife tomorrow)  
she asked me why I waxed the hairs  
and that I did it too much 

and that it doesn't fit my face and that I look ""girly"" which felt really nice even tho she was angry and mean about it (still felt sense of validation)  
then I ranted everything about her makeup on her face  
and found everything i hated  
and told her that she should care about herself and not me, I don't care about her appearance and she shouldn't either

i ranted about her lipstick, eyeliner and everything and she found a silly excuse ""well I'm a girl and I can do this an that""

then I told her that she should just leave me alone and do whatever I want It's non of her business  
she was really angry but shut up 

then I asked her for money cause I needed to buy gifts for a friend cause we played a game in school called ""Secret Santa"" basically we scramble our names in a small papers and we buy each other some gift (anonymously) 

and she gave me money and I took off, then later 2-3 hours my dad went to work (he doesn't probably know about this unless she told him when I was shopping)  
and she constantly looked in my face and I couldn't hold it so asked her to stop looking at it, then she was like ""do anything in the world you want just don't touch your eyebrows"" 

and I disagreed again and again and she told me that boys don't do this n that and that there are 2 ways of waxing eyebrows like doing it a little only If ur boy or a lot more if ur a girl  
 then i laughed a lot (couldn't hold myself)  
 now she went outside with her friends  
 tbh I got headache from all of this 

 and I'm really in shock both positively and negatively cause I'm stressed about everything that happen  
 but still I feel like whatever I'm doing It's working  
 cause after all my goal is to look girly (I'm not out yet to look fully blown GIRL)  
 and another thing is she is very strict about ""symmetry"" and offered to do my eyebrows (which I declined as her intentions is to make them more masculine)   
 and she told me I looked really bad   
 I look in the mirror and I think I looked really good.   
 

Today I sent picture of me and my class after long time of chatting like months and months cuz I was too scared to show my face but he was really positive and said I looked very feminine 

 so I think whatever I'm doing is working and my mom is trying to pull a reverse prank on me to make me feel bad so I stop doing this and make me feel ugly (even tho when I see in my mirror I feel proud about my progress) 

 my goals are stick to this as I'm happy even If she's not. I'm not happy about her look, she's not about mine. What a balance.

A sheet of sprayed metal upon some glass   
Set in a gaudy golden frame    
Of sturdy construction and considerable mass   
Amongst some circles has some fame   
For upon this foggy mirror you will see   
Who you were always meant to be 

Within the must and within the haze   
He sees her sitting at a table   
Guiding the elf through a maze   
And the Hostess grants her to be able   
For in her quiet she did find   
Those who tower above her   
But friends they are, nerdy and kind   
As the dwarf punches the cur   
And in this mirror the girl he does see   
Is him, who he one day will be. 

Through the mist and through the rain   
She looks upon the stoic man   
He still feels fear, vulnerability and pain   
Yet he stands tall and widens as a fan   
For he will listen should he want   
Or be rude and brutish should he please   
But inside the gears move never to flaunt   
As his thoughts are processed with ease   
And in this mirror the man she does see   
Is her, who she one day will be. 

In the doubt and in the agony   
I watch as she sits upon the chair   
Legs crossed, eyes up and long curled hair of near ebony   
Bottom plump and with breasts of quite a pair   
Like an amazon standing heads over men’s   
She delivers the most beautiful song   
To the audience attending in thousands of tens   
In the long flowing dress that she’d wanted all along   
And in this mirror the woman I do see

i wanted to talk about our relationship w my therapist and i was wondering what pronouns i should use when referring to her and whether i should mention her being trans? my therapist is also queer and uses they/them pronouns, and is very understanding of trans experiences.

ive considered just asking her what she would prefer, but im worried that she might think its weird or get worried that im talking to my therapist about her, and i dont really wanna get into this whole conversation re: mental health with her just yet.

im sorta leaning towards using she/her and telling my therapist that shes trans, since chances are, my therapist is never going to meet her/wont ever know who she is/wont tell anyone about what i say. what do you guys think?
