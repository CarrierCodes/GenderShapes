&amp;#x200B;

A little about me. I'm a 30-something guy, a good career,a normal relationship. No debt. Life is great, right. What's my problem? I don't feel like I'm living the right life. Through my teens, I never quite felt like a guy. I've always hated having body hair or participating in typical guy hobbies. I've always loved poetry, arts, emotional sappy music and movies, and so forth.  Used to closed door crossdress out of curiosity. Looking back I always felt super comfortable in women clothes. Not in a fetish way, but more in a relax around home thing. Unfortunately, god has a sense of humor and made me 6 foot tall, hairy from head to toe, wide shoulders and manly physique. Needless to say, I always hated looking at myself in a mirror. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for relationships, I've always been very attracted to femininity. Nothing about the male body does a thing for me. So I've almost exclusively dated women. Except... Yeah, hang on tight... One time I met a very feminine guy. He would wear very feminine clothes, clean shave what little hair he had, wore a little makeup and had cute hair. That was one of the most fulfilling relationships I've ever had. Even though it didn't work out, I learned a lot about myself. I enjoyed playing a feminine role, as well as the male role. I enjoyed his male genitalia as much as I enjoyed women's, and at times was definitely more comfortable with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make me Trans? Not exactly. But, somewhere, something awoke inside of me that I just can't put a finger on. My therapist doesn't really give me any insight and says it's a phase. So far, that's been a two decade phase! I hate looking at myself in the mirror. No matter how fit, thin, or attractive I feel, every day is a struggle to just feel ""normal"". Almost like I am living my life through the eyes of someone else. My current relationship is good, but she doesn't support my feminine side at all. So, I'm constantly suppressing that feeling and burying that desire. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice any one could give me? Maybe a book to read, or something to watch, so I can enlighten my life? I feel like the answers are all right in front of me, but I just can't figure out the right question to ask.

That was myself.

I am a dumbass.

---

Leave my sensibilities

unmolested, you witch

-

Dancing through my memories

as if you belonged all along.

-

You flit from scene to sacred scene

with out an answer to give

-

Drawing questions from the peace

hard purchased with pain and patience

-

And every night you take a dream

to entangle with a wish

-

waking me with my wanting

and absence rich as rum.

-

At times, I'd like to take your hand

and whisk you back to living eyes

-

But with your teasing, you lead me on

to see the patterns in living Earth

I cannot alone define.

If someone is trans gender they are transitioning from their assigned gender to some other place on our outside of the gender spectrum, this may include hormones or surgery, or different clothing /makeup that is less associated with their assigned gender as far as I've seen.

If someone wants to be healthy, they might take steps to eat or exercise to obtain the state of healthiness illustrated by doctors. If they say they are ""trans healthy"" but don't change their diet or exercise to reflect a change in that direction, is that different from people who claim ""trans gender"" without doing any transition like things?

This may sound completely ridiculous, but I'm just trying to understand, some people I know as afab cut their hair short and call it a transition and I am a bit confused,

*TLDR: How does ""Allyson May James"" sound as a name? I'm normal; treat me normal.   
**Okay, first the name thing**   
I've been thinking a lot about names, and i think I've narrowed down to one, i just want to know how it sounds to other people   
&gt;Allyson May James   
I wasn't born in may, i just liked the sound of it as a middle name, though i don't normally use my middle name.   
No worry about my full name being on the interwebs, I haven't used that name for anything yet, so you'd never find my with it.

---

**Next is my insight about being trans**   
* 1) transgender vs transsexual vs transvestite   
my own definitions are mostly based on the root words,   
trans meaning to go from one to another.   

-gender meaning the social constructed categories of gender, masculine/feminine. so being transgender would mean that you go from one gender to another, like a larger change, going from 80% masculine to 80% feminine (basically what i have done.)    

-sexual meaning the sex of the person, ie: male/female   
typically sex is determined by the chromosomes, as well as the combination of hormones and reproductive organelle , and other physical characteristics   

-transvestite meaning to present as the apposing gender, clothing etc. without desire to transition medically or social and retaining your default gender identity

For me, I am transgender and transsexual. I identify as feminine woman, and am also partaking in medical transition

* 2) For me personally, i don't tell people that I'm trans because they usually treat me different after being told/learning about me.   
Not usually in a bad way, like derogatory behavior. They just treat me like I'm a sensitive baby, when i just want to be treated like a person.   

also for me, i'm not actually proud to be trans. i don't identify as a transwoman, i just identify as a woman/female. nothing different or special. i don't need a safe space in the college library if someone missgenders me, i just correct them and move on, the same that any cis person would do.

I'm not even comfortable calling myself trans because I feel like I'm just over reacting or theres another reason for feeling this way. Then theres the issue of how I feel guilty for even thinking about transitioning because of how hard it'd be for my family to adjust/understand and accept me.

So later that night I tried binding and gave myself a fake beard with mascara and cried even more because for the first time in forever I didn't hate what I saw in the mirror.\nIts been a few months since then but the feelings are just getting harder and harder to ignore, and I'm at a point where I'm avoiding mirrors or any social situation where I'll be referred to femininely. All that said I still doubt myself because I don't really know if I'm comfortable with any permanent change. What if I transition and its not any better? What if its worse? I'm not even comfortable calling myself trans because I feel like I'm just over reacting or theres another reason for feeling this way. Then theres the issue of how I feel guilty for even thinking about transitioning because of how hard it'd be for my family to adjust/understand and accept me.\n\nSo I want to know is if I should act on this and try presenting differently, or maybe talk to a medical professional. I just want to feel comfortable existing, and would like some advice on how to do that :("", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I'm questioning and would really appreciate insight"", 'created': 1551536674.0}"

(I'm a girl, he just turned 17 and I'm about to turn 17)

We've been best friends since before he told me he was trans so I'm not completely used to calling him ""he"". He hasn't started taking T yet.

Of course I said yes because I've been extra gay for him since we started hanging out. I have a few concerns though:

&gt;I've heard that taking T can make your hormones crazy and cause mood swings and anxiety and stuff like that, some even describe it as traumatizing. I want to support him if it's difficult so if anybody has advice I'd love it.

&gt;I thought I was a lesbian but I decided that I love him for his personality so I don't care that he wants to me a man. Does that mean I'm pansexual? I've always felt that trans men are more empathetic and less scary than cis men so it's different to me. I don't know if we'd be together if he was a cis man. I'm confused about it all, idk.

&gt;Do you think he cares that I'm taller than him? I obviously can't help it but I don't want him to be upset that his girlfriend is 5'8"" and he's 5'2"". 

&gt;How do I tell my family that he's trans? They still call him ""Angie"" and think he's a girl because I haven't told them. I know my sister won't care but my parents are pretty judgemental and make cruel jokes about trans people sometimes. 

&gt;How can I help him with his own family? His mother is abusive and tells him he'll always be a girl and that he's insane. It makes me so sad that he has to endure that every day. My mom is abusive too but it isn't the same, so I can't understand completely.

2019-03-03 09:08:00,awsdrv,2,1,"My sister's ex BF just told her he is starting an m to f transition process. Sis (or any of us for that matter) hadn't seen it coming, she is devastated, because she id still hung up on them maybe getting back together and I want to support her in turning her feelings around so she can support him transitioning in stead. I'll call the ex he/him in here, for ease. But will of course call him by whatever pronouns he prefers in the future. 

Background: My sister is challenged in her learning abilities and her maturity level and in many situations has the mind of a teen despite being in her late 20's. The ex BF suffers from autism and is challenged in social constructs. 

We all love the ex in spite of not having met him a lot of times, he is sweet, respectful and great, but we also all agree that due to some behavioral issues that we attributed to the autism he was unfortunately unable to be the partner my sister needed and wanted. They have known each other since childhood, and had an agreement that if neither had partners when getting old, they'd move in together and give it another go.

My sister broke it off years ago, and had to have some distance because she was heartbroken. 

My sister's been hung up. She has not had a serious relationship since this guy and I have been trying to get her to understand that he would never be the guy for her (I never imagined how right I was) to get her to let go and live a fuller/better life. In vain, but I tried. 

The contact between them has been scarce, but a few days ago he texted her telling her about transitioning and how he was asked if he wanted to save/freeze down some sperm to be able to have biological children, and wanted to ask her if she wanted him to do that, since he wouldn't be able to honor their ""getting together when old"" agreement. None of us had any idea and were shocked. 

My sister is crushed. She called me sobbing, and I managed to talk her down a bit. She is not quite ready to be supportive of ex just yet, but she's a good girl, she will be. Right now she is feeling all the selfish, confused and jumbled up feelings that she is entitled to, but should not share with ex. She is grieving that her hope to get back together someday is forever gone, she is conflicted about the sperm thing even though she doesn't want children. Right now she is a mess, but she'll be fine.

Meanwhile I want to try and help her see things from a different perspective when she has had a bit of time to cry it out and help her see how this is a good thing. Ex has finally found out why he is feeling out of place, ex was being considerate of her, thinking her into his decision on the sperm. He did not have to do that. And now she can finally bury all hope of getting back together which has been holding her back for years. 

How do I help her get there and am I right in thinking she should keep how this news has affected her from ex unless asked directly by ex? To me her negative reaction is not what ex needs right now, he needs all the support he can get.

I'm sorry if this is unclear and jumbled up, but it is all so new, and I am just trying to support both my sister and her ex. Ex is a good person, no matter which gender (s)he is identifying with and I just want the best for both of them.

2019-03-03 23:31:48,ax03k7,2,3,"I've been sat here trying to figure how to begin to even vocalize the mess of thoughts swirling in my head around this topic, and I think this is the best approximation I can make.

&amp;#x200B;

I only started having actual serious thoughts about my gender identity roughly one year ago. Before then the concept of being trans was something I entertained in passing but never really thought actually applied to me. I can't even remember what exactly triggered it, but I remember talking to a fair few trans friends about their experiences and realizing that I related to more of them than I realized. Ever since then the thoughts have only been getting stronger to the point where I feel like I can't really just ignore them any more.

&amp;#x200B;

I have my first GIC appointment lined up for May. I don't know how it's going to go but the main reservations I have are the following:  


1) I've never really felt ""uncomfortable"" in my body/hated what I see in the mirror. I look in the mirror and I feel mostly indifferent to what I see, but I definitely like it more when I see more typically feminine traits (being clean shaven is a big one, I really dislike how I look with facial hair). At the same time, I don't feel crippled on a daily basis by this experience. Just that the idea of being a girl really appeals to me.

2) I feel shallow for wanting something that's solely superficial/based on looks. No matter how many times I tell myself that it's ridiculous or get told it's valid to have these feelings, I just feel like I should be happy with what I have and hate myself for not being so. I worry that I'm using this as a cover up for my general feelings of inadequacy and lack of fulfilment as a person. 

3) I have a large extended family that I love very much, but they're all very... ""normal"" for lack of a better word. And although I don't think they'd shun me if I came out as trans, the idea of explaining this all to them and becoming a ""talking point"" as I'm sure I would really does not sit well with me.

3.5) Half of said extended family comes from Brazil and I'm sure I don't even need to mention how terribly trans people are treated there. I don't want to feel unwelcome and unsafe in one of my home countries, especially given the current political climate there.

4) I already talked about these feelings with my mum and she kinda surprised me in the sense that she said she more saw me as kind of gender neutral anyway. She said she'd support me no matter what I decided but she did say she thought if I did HRT she thinks I'd end up regretting it in the long run.

Before then the concept of being trans was something I entertained in passing but never really thought actually applied to me. I can\'t even remember what exactly triggered it, but I remember talking to a fair few trans friends about their experiences and realizing that I related to more of them than I realized. Ever since then the thoughts have only been getting stronger to the point where I feel like I can\'t really just ignore them any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have my first GIC appointment lined up for May. I don\'t know how it\'s going to go but the main reservations I have are the following:  \n\n\n1) I\'ve never really felt ""uncomfortable"" in my body/hated what I see in the mirror. I look in the mirror and I feel mostly indifferent to what I see, but I definitely like it more when I see more typically feminine traits (being clean shaven is a big one, I really dislike how I look with facial hair). At the same time, I don\'t feel crippled on a daily basis by this experience. Just that the idea of being a girl really appeals to me.\n\n2) I feel shallow for wanting something that\'s solely superficial/based on looks. No matter how many times I tell myself that it\'s ridiculous or get told it\'s valid to have these feelings, I just feel like I should be happy with what I have and hate myself for not being so. I worry that I\'m using this as a cover up for my general feelings of inadequacy and lack of fulfilment as a person. \n\n3) I have a large extended family that I love very much, but they\'re all very... ""normal"" for lack of a better word. And although I don\'t think they\'d shun me if I came out as trans, the idea of explaining this all to them and becoming a ""talking point"" as I\'m sure I would really does not sit well with me.\n\n3.5) Half of said extended family comes from Brazil and I\'m sure I don\'t even need to mention how terribly trans people are treated there. I don\'t want to feel unwelcome and unsafe in one of my home countries, especially given the current political climate there.\n\n4) I already talked about these feelings with my mum and she kinda surprised me in the sense that she said she more saw me as kind of gender neutral anyway. She said she\'d support me no matter what I decided but she did say she thought if I did HRT she thinks I\'d end up regretting it in the long run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...it felt good to write that all out finally.

It was okay for like a day, but then I found out he got grounded for “life” and had his phone taken away. He then casually found a way to blame me for it and said his parents hated my guts causing me to cry afterwards[I am a really emotional person]. I am already dealing with personal issues with this on top of it so this really hurt.

  Let’s go back to a few weeks after we first met. He told me about a mental disorder called D.I.D. and how he was clinically diagnosed with it. Otherwise known as Dissociative Identity Disorder. It is where you have multiple personalities in your head. They are able to change and come out at free will. I supported him completely and soon got to know the personalities. He had backgrounds and names, one even had a British accent. But back to the main topic.

  After he blamed me for his grounding, I had to leave school early due to a severe anxiety attack that seemed endless. After a week, his mom texted me. She informed me of why he was grounded and said that he lied about his disorder and about how he wasn’t transgender. She also told me about how she actually didn’t hate me. I had enough and after the weekend ended, I ended it.

  After a few days, me and my friends noticed that he’d appear out of nowhere. He would be nowhere near us, then the next moment he would be within arms reach. This continued for the next week or so until I got called to the guidance councilors office. I walked to the councilors office and immediately saw my ex, shaking. I froze. After a moment, I sat down in the remaining chair which happened to be next to him. Then, she started to talk.

  She started to talk about how she wanted me back and how I left her. She even said she couldn’t get me out of her head and that she loved me. Hell, she admitted to stalking me. I’m half tempted to file a restraining order if it continues. Ever since the visit with him, I’ve gained a stutter which won’t go away.

  I wish girls would stop walking up to me to ask me out. It’s like coming out again and I’m a really shy person when face to face. Plus, I don’t like hurting anyone.

2019-03-04 14:25:54,ax7opw,5,0,"This is probably gonna sound very problematic, but I have an overall philosophical theory that might help explain being trans? It also includes explanations for Therian/Otherkin, and age regression, so if that’s gonna bother you, read no further.

Basically, the theory stems from an ancient (Greek I believe?) theory that everyone has alternative personalities living inside of them. Similar to Alters, or people with OSDD, these personalities can take many forms, including forms that don’t accurately match what the body portrays. While most people integrate throughout their lives, some people are affected by trauma and haunting experiences, and their mind is unable to integrate properly. These people are diagnosed with DID, OSDD, or similar.

Following me so far?

If you know anything about alters in DID or OSDD, you know that they can take many forms. Alters can be different genders, ages, sexualities, races, or even species from the host. 

Basically the theory is that people who identify as transgender, otherkin, etc.. integrated into a single overarching protector personality that doesn’t match their body’s presentation.

Not sure if it’s offensive to associate being trans with being a therian, or to associate it with DID/OSDD, but it’s absolutely not my intention to be rude or insensitive. I don’t think being trans is a mental illness, or something bad in any way shape or form, this is just a dumb cis person’s theory, and I acknowledge it could be and probably is completely wrong. 

I just wanted to get some thoughts on this, since it’s been in my head for a little while..

We use the term male and female to identify a biological process of chromosome determination. Yet we also use the same terminology for a social decision of gender.

Like, I didn’t show signs young enough, I’m to feminine, I just want attention, I’m just nonbinary, or I’m just a tomboy. It’s been stressing me out because now I’m actually not sure. I just wrote this poem thing to express how I feel.


I couldn't tell you a thing about my past. I literally only have vague and random memories from my childhood. I’ve been seeing trans guys that are like: ""Oh yeah, when I was five I cut big chucks out of my hair and said I was a boy."" Or ""Yay even when I was little I never felt like a girl."" Even ""When I was little I taught myself how to pee standing up because I knew I was a boy.""

All I remember from being little is useless stuff. I couldn't count to one hundred, I was better friends with our classroom  jar of worms than anyone in our class, I cried when I didn't get the part of the big bad wolf, I shoved baby dolls in play microwaves, and cut my hair with craft scissors because a kid dared me to.

I really had no concept of gender, I just was me. Because I was five and I wanted to be a dragon not a boy. I wanted to fly and be able to breathe underwater. I didn't give a shit if I was in a dress or wearing shorts or wearing the most mismatch outfit ever. I wanted to run and get dirty and yell and hit beehives and dig up worms. 

Because thats what kids do. They climb trees and cry because they can't get back down. They form gangs and play bade blades as recess. They play pirates with sticks, catch bugs, and break the rules. They hold hands and eat dandelion steams because they think they have milk in them. They fall down and they fight and they form who they're going to be in the future. 

I didn't think about the fact the wearing a jean skirt past my knees, a pink horse turtle neck, and turquoise cowboy boots was girly and very unfashionable. I wore it because my nanny wore jean skirts and because I wanted to be a cowboy. I didn't think about how wearing a blue dress with tutu and tinker bell on it was girly I wanted to be able to fly and I could run around just the same. 

I didn't grow up thinking I was a boy. I grew up knowing I was myself. 

So why is all that changing now, why are all these labels getting to my head? Why can't I just be me agian?

A flat chested tomboy who didn't give a shit what the rest of the world thought. I kid who wore pink dress and wanted to be a dragon. A kid who ate sand and jumped from trees, who got asthma and still ran until you had to force an inhaler into my mouth.

What happened to childhood? Because I want it back. I just want to be me again, not the label that they put on me.

This server is for talking about how LGBT characters are portrayed in the media we watch. That's the topic, but we're more than that! We are an /lgbt/ server that promotes positive attitudes toward those in this community. Whether you're here for discussion or support, our members are great people that you can lean on. Hope to see you there!

I think it's important that we have positive images of trans characters appearing on TV, because that's how the average person is going to see us. TV has always shaped public perception, and with this issue it's no different. I don't mean to come on here just to advertise a server, so please use this thread as a way to talk about the best and worst representations of trans people we've seen in the media so far. To give n example, Denise from the original airing of Twin Peaks was always a good portrayal of us, I think. Cooper never sees her as anything but who she is, and her character isn't played as a joke. She's competent and her gender doesn't define her character. That's a lot for a 1991 TV show.

2019-03-06 17:59:14,ay1r8u,9,82,"I'm an afab 20 (soon to be 21) person in a relationship with an amab (soon to be 22) person. We've been dating for a year and five months and we've the happiest we've ever been in a relationship. We've had ups and downs since we started off as friends with benefits but we're very close now.

However, I'm an in the closet transmasculine nb person who hasn't come out and doesn't plan to any time soon. At least to people besides my openly LGBT friends. Mostly because I don't want to be wrong about my identity. Also because my family is conservative, religious and transphobic. I don't want to come off as a transtrender. I know my identity won't be taken seriously by most so I don't have a lot of incentive to not repress and deal with my buried away social dysphoria. My aspergers also likely contributes to this so I don't know if my identity is real or autism related.

I'm bisexual and I've always had a preference for women but resorted to dating exclusively men after a relationship with a woman to avoid issues with my family. 

My partner is also bisexual, and had a preference for boys since he was young. He was often the subject of teasing and bullying for their feminine personality as child and has admitted to having some internalized homophobia/transphobia as a result. He often feels insecure as labelling himself as bi bc of this, perhaps.

He comes from an eastern european family that is socially conservative so you can imagine how much lgbt people repress their identities in these queerphobic environments. Toxic masculinity was also a large element in his upbringing. 

My partner has opened up a lot to me about his attraction to men after learning more from having accepting and lgbt friends, as well as having a ""bisexual gf"". However it's his gender identity that he's really vague about.

He will label himself as male and present as male to male friends and peers that come from that cishetero ""bro"" environment if you know what I mean. 

However he always stands out because of his feminine mannerisms, soft voice and long hair. He had (still has) a lot of female friends as a teen. He is interested in drag and wants to be able to do it with lgbt friends when we go back to live in a more accepting place like Denmark after the summer holidays. He points to drag/transfeminine characters in media that pops up with ""That's me"", as a ""joke"". He has asked me at least five times if I would still love him if he was a trans girl, then when I get serious he backpedals and says it's a ""joke"". He calls himself genderfluid almost everyday now as a running ""joke"" in the past week, in the past it has been that or agender but less often. He crosses his legs. He ALWAYS plays as a girl in rpg videogames, and flipped with delight at the option of a drag outfit Link can wear in Breath Of The Wild.

""If I can't play as a girl, what's the point"" he says.

He is emotionally intelligent compared to most other men. He is affectionate, warm, gives great advice, is a good listener and always supports his male friends emotionally in a way their other male friends cannot.

He also was chronically insecure and uncomfortable with his body for a long time until I helped him relax more. He still feels insecure about it even though he arguably is attractive with a nice figure. He wouldn't go to the beach without a shirt, god forbid shower with his gf when we started dating, even after we already had sex.

In the past I basically was forcing myself to be attracted to the men who wanted to date me, perhaps as a result of compulsory heterosexuality. I would have sex with them to try and get closer but I felt no attraction to them, not emotionally or physically. 

Maybe I'm projecting my trans experience onto my bf but he was the first ""man"" I felt genuinely attracted to. To be honest it's because I felt a stong feminine and emotionally mature energy from him since we first started dating. We joke all the time that a lot of the gender roles are switched in the relationship- in terms of tasks, emotional dynamics, and behavioural patterns. 

I don't want my partner to be something they're not. I would never want to push them to become trans or something. That's why I find it difficult to discuss this with them. 

If they're just a gnc bi guy that's okay. But if they're a transfeminine nonbinary person, genderfluid, agender or a transwoman, it would make a lot of sense. I'm not saying that any of the traits he has is anything that makes someone a woman in isolation. But together, he is showing a lot of signs that remind me of how my other trans friends were while in the closet. 

It's frustrating because everytime I try to address this elephant in the room (after he makes the same ""joke"" for the 10th time in a way he doesnt do with his other memes) he backpedals, becomes defensive and says he wasn't that serious after all. 

Although yesterday he rambled on and was saying stuff unprompted like ""I'm genderfluid! I don't know, I don't know if I care about my gender. Is there a ""It's complicated"" option for gender on facebook? While laughing.

The thing is he doesn't really know that I think I'm trans myself.

He is not transpohobic, and has learned a lot from his lgbt friends after coming from an ignorant &amp; homophobic environment. He fully acknowledges that gender is in the brain and not the body and defends gay/trans ppl when confronted with trans/homophobic ideology. Of course he still admits he has some internalized transphobia/misinfo and sometimes we both make edgy jokes about gender politics that don't mean any harm.

I tried to talk with him about my social dysphoria before but chickened out. He kind of knows I'm at the very least gender nonconforming, and sometimes talks about me as a man or boy as a form of affection, closeness. But I feel terrible that I haven't been open with him about the extent of it, especially when he might be confused himself.

I'm deeply afraid of being rejected for being trans male. My ex was transphobic and pushed me deep into repression whenever I had any masculine tendencies.

My current partner is bisexual, like I said, but doesn't believe he could be in a relationship with a guy outside of sex. Maybe it's unfair of me to say but this belief could be due to internalized homophobia from being raised as a cishetero man. 

But I also don't want to decide or label my partner with anything he doesn't feel comfortable with. I want them to be happy and I want to be open with him about myself too but I am not sure how to proceed. 

We need to have a conversation about it but my autism makes it difficult to tell if he's joking or not and also makes it difficult to initiate a serious convo about it that doesn't end up with us joking, backpedaling and evading the elephant in the room.

He often feels insecure as labelling himself as bi bc of this, perhaps.\n\nHe comes from an eastern european family that is socially conservative so you can imagine how much lgbt people repress their identities in these queerphobic environments. Toxic masculinity was also a large element in his upbringing. \n\nMy partner has opened up a lot to me about his attraction to men after learning more from having accepting and lgbt friends, as well as having a ""bisexual gf"". However it\'s his gender identity that he\'s really vague about.\n\nHe will label himself as male and present as male to male friends and peers that come from that cishetero ""bro"" environment if you know what I mean. \n\nHowever he always stands out because of his feminine mannerisms, soft voice and long hair. He had (still has) a lot of female friends as a teen. He is interested in drag and wants to be able to do it with lgbt friends when we go back to live in a more accepting place like Denmark after the summer holidays. He points to drag/transfeminine characters in media that pops up with ""That\'s me"", as a ""joke"". He has asked me at least five times if I would still love him if he was a trans girl, then when I get serious he backpedals and says it\'s a ""joke"". He calls himself genderfluid almost everyday now as a running ""joke"" in the past week, in the past it has been that or agender but less often. He crosses his legs. He ALWAYS plays as a girl in rpg videogames, and flipped with delight at the option of a drag outfit Link can wear in Breath Of The Wild.\n\n""If I can\'t play as a girl, what\'s the point"" he says.\n\nHe is emotionally intelligent compared to most other men. He is affectionate, warm, gives great advice, is a good listener and always supports his male friends emotionally in a way their other male friends cannot.\n\nHe also was chronically insecure and uncomfortable with his body for a long time until I helped him relax more. He still feels insecure about it even though he arguably is attractive with a nice figure. He wouldn\'t go to the beach without a shirt, god forbid shower with his gf when we started dating, even after we already had sex.\n\nIn the past I basically was forcing myself to be attracted to the men who wanted to date me, perhaps as a result of compulsory heterosexuality. I would have sex with them to try and get closer but I felt no attraction to them, not emotionally or physically. \n\nMaybe I\'m projecting my trans experience onto my bf but he was the first ""man"" I felt genuinely attracted to. To be honest it\'s because I felt a stong feminine and emotionally mature energy from him since we first started dating. We joke all the time that a lot of the gender roles are switched in the relationship- in terms of tasks, emotional dynamics, and behavioural patterns. \n\nI don\'t want my partner to be something they\'re not. I would never want to push them to become trans or something. That\'s why I find it difficult to discuss this with them. \n\nIf they\'re just a gnc bi guy that\'s okay. But if they\'re a transfeminine nonbinary person, genderfluid, agender or a transwoman, it would make a lot of sense. I\'m not saying that any of the traits he has is anything that makes someone a woman in isolation. But together, he is showing a lot of signs that remind me of how my other trans friends were while in the closet. \n\nIt\'s frustrating because everytime I try to address this elephant in the room (after he makes the same ""joke"" for the 10th time in a way he doesnt do with his other memes) he backpedals, becomes defensive and says he wasn\'t that serious after all. \n\nAlthough yesterday he rambled on and was saying stuff unprompted like ""I\'m genderfluid! I don\'t know, I don\'t know if I care about my gender. Is there a ""It\'s complicated"" option for gender on facebook? While laughing.\n\nThe thing is he doesn\'t really know that I think I\'m trans myself.\n\nHe is not transpohobic, and has learned a lot from his lgbt friends after coming from an ignorant &amp; homophobic environment. He fully acknowledges that gender is in the brain and not the body and defends gay/trans ppl when confronted with trans/homophobic ideology. Of course he still admits he has some internalized transphobia/misinfo and sometimes we both make edgy jokes about gender politics that don\'t mean any harm.\n\nI tried to talk with him about my social dysphoria before but chickened out. He kind of knows I\'m at the very least gender nonconforming, and sometimes talks about me as a man or boy as a form of affection, closeness. But I feel terrible that I haven\'t been open with him about the extent of it, especially when he might be confused himself.\n\nI\'m deeply afraid of being rejected for being trans male. My ex was transphobic and pushed me deep into repression whenever I had any masculine tendencies.\n\nMy current partner is bisexual, like I said, but doesn\'t believe he could be in a relationship with a guy outside of sex. Maybe it\'s unfair of me to say but this belief could be due to internalized homophobia from being raised as a cishetero man. \n\nBut I also don\'t want to decide or label my partner with anything he doesn\'t feel comfortable with. I want them to be happy and I want to be open with him about myself too but I am not sure how to proceed. \n\nWe need to have a conversation about it but my autism makes it difficult to tell if he\'s joking or not and also makes it difficult to initiate a serious convo about it that doesn\'t end up with us joking, backpedaling and evading the elephant in the room.

2019-03-07 16:09:10,aye8q2,2,2,"okay, so here we go

sex is *quite old* - it appeared as a way to give organisms the ability to specialise in stuff without their species becoming incapable of other stuff at the same time. they got two sexes because that way it's safer - it's kinda difficult to make more than 2 animals stick together in order to be a fully functional unit of life

those early forms of life didn't have *brains*, only nerve cell chains that performed simple algorithms. humans *didn't* get rid of it, they just built their stuff on top.

as a rule of thumb, in most species their bodies only come with *one* instruction set (which is determined by brain feminisation/masculinisation), in order to save precious matter; so animals (or people) relying on that set to do most of everything wouldn't be able to function if they got the wrong one.

our cooler brain parts work on *glucose*, which is rare in nature - so we instead fall back on more primitive systems whenever possible (leading to biases) for easier survival. like love and fear take over reason, so does dysphoria - a very deep disconnect.

think of two stacks of books of equal height, with a third one on top of both of them. if you pull on one of the bottom ones, the whole structure will collapse. this is kind of analogous to dysphoria manifesting itself in society's terms (even though its rules aren't intrinsic to our bodies) - remember, we built it all *on top* of what out ancestors had.

2019-03-07 22:38:44,ayiqgm,4,13,"I really have no idea where to go with this... but I also somehow feel like I really want to put it out there, somewhere.

After questioning, exploring, discussing and testing for about a year, I feel like I have found an answer, at least for now. I am a trans woman, but won't transition. 

In therapy and many other places I heard the question ""how do I handle [insert problem/bad experience]"" and I noticed that at least in my case, handling a problem always means to find an answer to a certain question. In some cases it was ""why is it like that"" or ""what does that mean"".

Well, in the case of being transgender, it came to the question ""what am I gonna do with this?"" It was very early clear to me that I am trans, that nothing would make me happier than being a woman. But that was not the answer I needed, that came a lot later. In the form of my girlfriend. She is (obviously) the best person on earth an has given me waaaay more than I deserve. And she decided to become a couple despite knowing that I am trans and might make her a lesbian, an idea that she wasn't exactly fond of, but kept quiet, because she didn't want to be in the way of my happiness.

But after a while I asked her what her real thaughts about this are and her answer was basically that she is not against it, especially if it means I am happy, but she loves me the way I am and is afraid of a transition changing exactly that. Maybe not true, but gender is a huge part of personality after all, so it's not unreasonable. But my decision was not because of this (although it would be a lie to say it didn't have a part in this).

It made me think, what do I want to do with my trans-ness? What to do with this incredibly rare ressource inside me? And those questions finally brought the answer. In my case and my living situation, it just does not seem exactly worth it. I am one of the blessed persons who do not absolutely despise their body. Not fond of it, at all, but I think I can make it work. So if I train and work on myself, psychologically and physically, I can make myself maybe not the person I should have been born as, but something I can still be proud of.

Sure, it will always be harder than for me than for cis guys, but transition is risky and a very very hard path to follow. My respect and utmost envy to everyone doing it. So yea, my answer is the following: I choose not to become what I should have been born as, but will use the old me, which failed at life and the girl sleeping inside me to forge a person in between both sides, making me a ""hetero sexual, bright pink loving trans-y 'boy'friend""

First, I know it might all get better, but this is just situation as it is NOW.

If you need a name, call me Shiro as I haven't decided on new name yet (thinking about Tobias and Nataniel). I'm 16 years old trans boy. I told my parents and few of my friends, but I really present as male only on the internet. But, my parents don't believe me. My mom told my threapist TWO times how beautiful girl I am and that I just don't wan't to accept myself because I suffered from ED and I was bullied for major time of my elementary school. Also, I am not zou tzpical masculine guy. I don't like sport much. I would preffer to recieve flowers over anzthing else, I love my plushes (mainly big yellow dog called Jupiter I took when my older brother wanted to throw him out. This dog is a lot for me), I am an artist and unbelievably hopeless romantic. And yes, all those things are associeted with females in my family. I have short hair, which is really silly, but yes, even this is more common in women than men in my family. Basically, I am you average girl if you take a look at my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the sad and possibly homeless part, when I gave you some background. My mom did agreed to go to sexuologist with me/ but she told me she will do it when she has time. I know work is more important to her, so I am trying to belive her she really does not have time. But deep down, I know she doesn't want me to go, because she is scared I will eventually start trasition. I want you to know I undertsand her reasons. And I am trying to open up to her about this gender issue a bit, but she will always just shut me down, raise her voice if I won't shut up. She told me two times she is not going to support me in any way, which hurts a lot. My dad thinks I'm typical female becasue I want to be physically a man/ basically ""You have to put up with everything and there are no shortcuts. Every woman hates her periods"" -I doubt every woman wants to rip her guts out to stop that thing. The thing is, if they will kick me out, I will end up homeless. Becasue I can't pay for anything I would need, and I'm the type of person that will feel bad if they will go to live someone else, not being financially able to help them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just really scared at this point and I hope I will able to get support from my parents, or at least acceptance. I feel guilty for feeling that this body just does not fit and for the fact my parents are sad. Or at least my mom. I know. I see. And I feel very bad for it, because I caused it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't seek a resolution or comfortation, at least not as a primar of this post. I just wanted to pour my stupidly big aching heart out to someone who I know will listen, because many of you probably went through something similar.

So worth it.

I had my orchiectomy with Dr. Arnkoff in Farmington MI. He is the most straightforward doc I've met. Knew his stuff, don't be turned off by the fact that you call him directly on his personal cell and he covers exactly the facts as you want them and nothing else.

I showed up at a clinic with a cashier's check, not entirely certain that it would all work out, but if you want to do this your way without gatekeeping you have to take some leaps of faith.

Fortunately this community has been amazing. Resources like reddit and susan's place helped me find a doctor that was competent, used my pronouns, and most importantly there was none of the judgmental gatekeeping that would have forced me into 10 more months of destructive anti-androgens before I could consider a consult with one of two medical teams in the state.

It was so straightforward. The doc and an assistant who held my hand when he cut through the scar tissue of an old vasectomy.

I had such big horrible balls grafted onto me. Both of them mentioned the horrible size of them, in a professional manner. There was a reason I could never tuck.

My heart was racing, for some reason we were listening to the Carpenters as he made the first few incisions. Local anesthetic. The shots hurt but were increasingly dull as they got deep into the sac. By the time the were removing organs what I felt was mostly tugging.

And the intensity of my own imagination.

I would not look down. I was breathing so heavily, my body shaking with shock, until the moment he removed that thing from me.

Then tears. Instant, shockingly profound relief as that toxic feedback loop closed forever. I was sobbing as I described my dysphoria, clenching that assistant's hand, it was like a birth.

Once they removed the second pustule i eased up. my demeanor has shifted. I read as happy where before people could always sense my discomfort and pain.

I am changed. I am free.

Looking at them on the operating table, they were never mine. They were always invaders. They were always toxic little planted assassins, and I felt no sense of loss. I have carried them for 33 years out of some twisted sense of obligation, but now I have been struck from my ball-and-chain.

No one that knows who they are and what they need should have to wait. This is too safe and effective to bear such stigma.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a boy so bad from the age of 5-11. I dressed like a boy, played with the boys at school, and tried to hide my long hair. A lot of kids actually thought I was a boy. I knew I liked girls too. My adopted mom kept saying, “(name), you’re a girl.” That rubbed me the wrong way a lot of times. 

Once I go into 6th grade, I started being more like a girl due to the lockrook for PE. I dressed still like a tomboy though. I got more comfortable being a girl, but there was always something missing. 

Throughout high school, I still was a tomboy; and even in college (still in college). Right now I feel more comfortable as a female and I have a girlfriend whom I love. It was all thanks to this one hook-up I did with my best friend in college at the time. I never had a best friend who was a lesbian and she showed me that it was okay to be. 

I can’t help by wonder though that, yes I am a lesbian, but when I’m around my girlfriend, a lot of the time I feel like I’m going back to my younger self and feel like a guy again. 

I’m not sure if this is appropriate or not and someone is welcome to tell me otherwise and I’ll delete it, but I feel like I have the parts of a guy down there sometimes when I don’t. I felt it as a kid and I still feel it today.

In my opinion, and standpoint, it is starting to seem like that sometimes, a lot of the fear and anxiety that comes with somebody coming out, comes from the inside (technically). And when I say that, I mean like, trans-trenders tend to be a big maker of fear in being accepted. Don’t get me wrong, transphobia and intolerance, in the outside world, is ABSOLUTELY a huge issue and is awful.

Sorry-back to the topic. I genuinely see people be more fearful of coming out because they fear they won’t be taken seriously along with being rejected and unaccepted.

So give yourself self exams and if you find a lump, call your doctor. Here are some tips on WHAT TO DO. Because **knowing** is half the battle!   

## How should a breast/chest self-exam be performed? 

### 	1) In the Shower 

	Using the pads of your fingers, move around your entire breast in a  circular pattern moving from the outside to the center, checking the  entire breast and armpit area. Check both breasts each month feeling for  any lump, thickening, or hardened knot. Notice any changes and get  lumps evaluated by your healthcare provider.

### 	2) In Front of a Mirror 

	Visually inspect your breasts with your arms at your sides. Next, raise your arms high overhead.

	Look for any changes in the contour, any swelling, or dimpling of the  skin, or changes in the nipples. Next, rest your palms on your hips and  press firmly to flex your chest muscles. Left and right breasts will not  exactly match—few women's breasts do, so look for any dimpling,  puckering, or changes, particularly on one side.

### 	3) Lying Down

	When lying down, the breast tissue spreads out evenly along the chest  wall. Place a pillow under your right shoulder and your right arm behind  your head. Using your left hand, move the pads of your fingers around  your right breast gently in small circular motions covering the entire  breast area and armpit.

	Use light, medium, and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple; check for  discharge and lumps. Repeat these steps for your left breast.",trans,Y'ALL.

2019-03-12 03:20:37,b02v4a,1,3,"Are there other people who feel like me? 

I’m dfab, but for pretty much as long as I can remember, maybe since I was a little kid I’ve seen myself as male. Even if I have long hair and I’m wearing dresses, I see myself as male, and I feel comfortable with myself. I guess I think of myself as a cross dresser, I don’t know. Sometimes I have short hair and dress more masculine and it makes me feel good, I like to wear both genders of clothes. 

But when I feel dysphoria, is when I remember society doesn’t see me as male. Thinking about that is making me tear up. I see myself and my body as male, but society doesn’t and it hurts. I usually don’t have any problem with what I was born with, I’m confident in my body, I have small breasts and I’m very thin so I think I have a cute and sexy, sort of androgynous body. It’s just when I remember what the world thinks of me and it hurts so much. That’s when I feel dysphoria, when I’m not seen as a boy. I wish everyone could see me and just know I’m a boy. But they don’t and it hurts. It’s easy to have people call me a male online but I can’t convince people in real life so easily. Other times I feel dysphoria are when I watch porn maybe. I’m always wishing I was the man , I wish I could use my penis on a girl. When I masturbate it feels like a penis should be there. And then I start to feel inferior. Like I could never please a girl the way a man with a penis could and I’m not good enough because I don’t have one. A while ago I dated a gay trans man who made me feel so terrible about having a vagina when I was ok with it. He would say they are ugly and pretend I had a penis. So I feel inferior and like I’m not good enough because I don’t have a penis.

But I’m usually ok usually with what I have by myself and surgery and hormones sound scary. I don’t know if I could ever commit to something like that. I feel like my feelings go back and forth and I’m constantly confused and wondering what I am. When I google about trans men and sex I can never really identify with it, A lot of trans men seem so uncomfortable about being touched or what their parts are called and that’s fine, I understand, but me personally I’ll call my parts a pussy or let people touch my breasts if they like them and it seems like no other people would ever like that and I feel more confused. I feel like I fall under the definition of a “transtrender” and it makes me cry, because I don’t think I’m female, I think I’m male. What am I!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m starting to cry because I feel so confused and bad. I wish I could be seen as male but I feel like a joke because I guess nothing about me is very male. Another problem is I identify with loving women, so it feels so confusing and bad. I identify with lesbians and feminine people loving each other and I feel more confused. I feel overwhelmed and sad. I wish I was born male, but I don’t wish to change what I have, I just wish I had it to begin with.

2019-03-12 17:09:01,b0a9ew,2,3,"Hey friends! So: I consider myself a trans ally. I’m a freelance photographer / docu producer, and had a thought today regarding the fight for Trans military service people. Here’s my thought:

What if I started interviewing - on camera - military members who’s lives have been impacted by a trans service member? My perspective is that there is NO reason a trans service member should not be able to serve openly in the military. I also believe (tho I need to do research) there is NO evidence that shows service members who are trans (and pls forgive me if I’m not using the best term - I’m always open to learning!) are any more of a burden on the military than other service members. 

I think that showing conversations &amp; interviews with trans service members &amp; their colleagues who work alongside them could help “unconvinced” Americans open their eyes to the reality of the situation: that trans service members are patriots who work hard every day to serve our country and serve with distinction. 

And I would like to be a small part of that message. What I would like to do is look into grants for this, hire an inclusive team to research/shoot &amp; distribute these pieces to a wider audience. However; because I am an ally and not one who has personally lived through this experience, I was hoping to reach out to you lovely folks on this sub to see if you have opinions on such a project, and how I could work with an inclusive team to produce something truly excellent.

I'm just a regular guy, who honestly has some questions, born out of curiosity, and the desire to understand other people better.

I don't have any trans acquittances I could get some perspective from, I don't have any strong emotional investment in any political, religious, racial, or any other kind of agenda.

I'm no a writer, reporter, advisor, lawmaker, or seek any kind of benefit other than personal growth.

I wish you all the best, as much as that can be wished to a stranger than you've never met.
I don't consider any of you worse, or for that matter, better than any other person I don't know, just because you belong to the LGBT community.

Sorry for the somewhat lengthy introduction, but I really want to stress the the questions I have will not be meant as personal attacks to anyone, the trans topic seems to be, understandably, very emotionally charged.

If anything I say/ask offends you, I apologize in advance, I didn't mean to, please remember that I'm not in your shoes, and It might be hard for me to understand where you are coming from.

At the same time, please try not to be deride my questions, comments, or concerns if they seem somewhat insensitive, remember the previous paragraph, for lack of a better metaphor, I'm being the fat guy at the gym here.

All that being said I have questions, some of them, due to personal and maybe somewhat uneducated conclusions, might be misinterpreted as attacks, and I'd like to start a conversation, not a debate.

Would it be fine to do it here? Or would it be better to do it trough PMs?

One way or another, thanks to everyone, I wish you the best :)

so i'm a trans woman, pre-HRT, still in school, and not out to my family, or friends, or really anyone but my closest circle.

i started going to an after-school club, i forget the term but it's basically an LGBTQ space, so i could be around, well, people like me.  
i was mildly disappointed to realize it was 99% trans men, and not a trans woman in sight.  
i recently moved to the current school system, and only just now found out that *not a single out trans woman has graduated because she's either had to move or be homeschooled due to transphobia*.

i'll save the whole ""it's easier for trans guys in some regards because &lt;X&gt;"" bs for an r/unpopularopinion post, but anyways, i was already on edge. i have shit self-esteem, so i figured that i was screwed.

imagine my surprise when three of the most transphobic, r/dankmemes, assholish, it's-funny-to-be-offensive types use my trans name.

imagine my surprise when i find out that someone outed me.

imagine the downright breakdown i had when i had to cover it all up like a fucking slander, then try to find out who it was.

imagine my hurt when i realize that it was someone i trusted. a lot.

so, for some reason, one of the girls in the club (i dont know her name but i always identified her as Highlighter or Lesbian since she's the only lesbian and has bright yellow hair) outed me to a trio of Catholic (as in ""homosexuality is a sin"" Catholic), transphobic (a trans girl is a trap/dickgirl, a trans guy is a girl in her boyfriend's shirt), and just mean people she could have.  
and then one of them asked another club member (whom i don't blame as much as the first, since in this case it was more of a ""Morgan told me she goes by she/her in club, is this true?"" deal). and now i'm outed. and terrified. it's not entirely out yet but my parents wouldn't ever help me since their experience with trans people is SJW Gone Mad (Cringe Comp) videos, the school wouldn't do shit, and i'm trapped.

Yes, that fits.

\-Sometimes if it is a powerful movie I might cry.

\-I have thought about it fairly seriously.

\-I know that I am transgender.

\-I am a crossdresser.

\-I am probably transgender.

Are orgasms the same? in other words, from male to female do you experience the same orgasm effect as a former male? or has the surgical techniques improved so that the feeling is that of a woman having an orgasm.

2019-03-15 15:54:25,b1gkba,0,1,"So when my partner found out I was trans. It wasn't so great. They found out from an ex who outed me, because they were angry I was no longer with them and hoped that it would ruin my relationship. 

I'm very particular with who I tell mostly because the first person I came out to, the experience was absolutely horrible. I don't really want to talk about it in this post but let's just say, it was enough for me to pretty much want to never tell anyone or make any effort to be me (but of course, that eats away at me inside). Pretty much no one knew, except the first person I told, and my ex because I thought I could trust them. 

I wasn't anywhere near ready to speak up about it, I trusted my partner, but I was afraid. My partner asked me if it was true, and they were pretty shocked when I admitted it. (I'm ftm, I've made little to no effort to pass due to wanting to get a job, move and be the real me somewhere else at that time.) They weren't particularly comfortable, but the reason was because they weren't attracted to men. They weren't bi, so it's fair that they weren't comfortable knowing I'm a guy. 

My partner loves me for my personality so they stayed and gave the relationship a go, they told me if it didn't work out because they aren't attracted to men, we would be best friends instead. They were very encouraging about my transition from the start though. (which after learning they came from a conservative place and a Conservative family, it was honestly shocking to me) they did so much research to become familiar with the process and everything to understand what I was feeling, what I'm going through and what I will be going through, to the best of their ability. But also they would ask me questions because of course, everyone transitions differently. All of this, was so much more than I could ever ask for. 

About over a year, nearly 2 years passes, they've become a lot more accepting about me being a man. Things start becoming sexual between us, but no sex. It's not something either of us are ready for just yet. (at this point I'm 18/19 and have finally gained interest in sex, my partner is close to my age, just a little older and has not sexually matured at this point. We both thought they were asexual, but later on we found out we are both demisexual. My partner wanted me to be happy and would do these things with me when I asked, but I didn't ask often because I felt like it was selfish to) 

Another 2 years pass, they no longer mind that I'm male. They have begun referring to me as their husband/hubby to people they trust. (we're not yet married, we're engaged, but my partner loves calling me their hubby in front of people and not get afraid of the backlash either of us will get. Beforehand I was introduced as what I am. ""fiancee"" for safety reasons of course.) which has made me comfortable enough to actually put effort in looking like the man I am. Outside of the home. It was a big step that I've delayed out of fear. But my partner showed me I can trust people. It's not always bad. 

2 more years. I'm walking around my local adult store. I see a packer. I've delayed buying them online because Ive never been able to afford it (and honestly I was scared of how my partner would react, I knew they accept me for who I am at this point. But I wasn't entirely sure if they were ready for the changes to my body) but this one was cheap (so was the quality). Without even thinking about whether my partner would react positively or negatively, I bought it and went straight home in excitement. I was so excited about this, I was really hopeful about their reaction.

Eventually it comes to me showing them. It gets pretty personal here but my partner was really excited and happy to see that part of me that was missing. Even if it's just a prosthetic for now, all the fear that I had in the back of my mind was gone. Unfortunately that prosthetic wasn't made to be used during sex, so they were pretty upset learning that. (I'm still not ready for sex at this point. It was disappointing knowing I couldn't use it yet, but I've been setting my eyes on one that looks more real and can be used for sex. As well as sleeping with it. Even though the one I had said I shouldn't sleep with it, of course I didn't listen. I'm an active sleeper, the material was cheap and of course it broke. And that was devastating.)

Fast forward to now. I'm still not financially stable but I'm at the point where I'm considering hormones. My partner of course is accepting of this and is waiting for me to take my next step.
Theres things that have been holding me back from this treatment. The fear of the hormones fucking with me.

You see, because of a problem with my body biologically, I suffer with chronic physical pain. Painkillers never work so one of the things they tried with me was hormone treatment. They treated me with estrogen. I couldn't see through the entire treatment to see if it could help with the pain because it fucked with my head really bad. I cried all the time. And was a lot more suicidal than I was before the treatment. I hated myself more than I did. Though it was the wrong hormones for me. I'm scared I'll react the same with the right hormones.

2019-03-16 01:21:33,b1mv59,14,13,"Not all trans women feel the urge to present as femme, you know?
If you desire something and are told you can not have it, sometimes the person is okay with it and sometimes they aren't.

I have always been a very tomboyish person. I'm mtf but I don't feel dysphoria about my genitals or lack of chest. I dont particularly feel I'm missing out when I'm not wearing skirts or dresses. It happens on occasion but it absolutely isn't a necessity. Bottom line is, dysphoria is nearly always a result of expectations, either expectations we put on ourselves or society puts on us. If you're not the kind of person that lets expectations bother you, then that part of your personality doesn't just magically dissapear because you're trans.

My biggest signifier as to why I'm trans is that I strongly and passionately disagree with *being* a man. I cannot see myself as a man, and I don't feel like one. I dont need to look at my body and yearn for something different to know that I am a woman. It's enough that society is constantly trying to scrutinize trans people and their decisions, the last frontier we need is other trans people trying to discredit the individual experiences of other people like themselves.

It is toxic to believe or think that you need to have dysphoria to be trans, because of people like me, that delayed my transition for almost 11 years because of that very sentiment.
When you oppose the idea of something that represents the struggles of many individuals, you're falling into the same intransigent pattern that causes intolerance to begin with.

Being trans isn't some definable thing. It's when you don't fit into the tentpoles of gender conformity that society has built for you.
It doesn't take a permanent life altering decision to transform your appearance and experience life as the opposite gender.
Most boys only need to wear makeup to school *once* and suddenly they will be pressed through laughter on whether they are queer or trans.
What defines that which is male or female is so incredibly fragile, that in showing the slightest interest in that which is deemed *the other* gender leads your parents to freak out or disown you. Great news though! By associating with the trans community you may find security, no matter how you feel in your gender identity, you will be accepted, and that's part why the trans identity exists. Not because we belong to some futuristic and newly invented gender, but because we're men, women or neither, and society disallows us to take our place where we rightfully belong, always forcing us into one or the other.

No person should ever be urged away from transition if they ever approach the idea on their own accord. They themselves are the proof that they are trans, and if they feel differently later, that's perfectly fine, and is not the end of the line. Please recognize that being trans is not difficult or an uphill battle because being yourself is complicated, it isn't! It's complicated because we're constantly having to prove our own validity to people around us, if it weren't for that, we wouldn't be trans. We would just be the most authentic version of ourselves, no weight from societal expectations or norms. I would be a woman, you would be who you are and things would be a lot simpler.

We need binaries like trans to explain that 1 and 0 are indeed the biological variations of birth sex, but not the entire picture. You and I both know that a system that goes up to 2 still contains the base biology (1 and 0), yet a new binary, being the social aspect that needs to be accounted for.

If you're not already having a TDOV celebration or could pass this along so more people can access it as a resource, would you mind sharing this initiative so more trans youth can access their own community? 

Some of the influencers to be interviewed includes trans actors (**Sense 8!**), transgender elders (**creator of TDOV, Transgender Day of Remembrance,** etc.),  Cassandra James - the **first trans woman to ever be on stage at the Oscars**. **Hillary Whittington** \- a mother whose child came out at the age of four and has transitioned. I would love to pass these stories along to people in general (I welcome you to like or share it yourself, to people both in the community, those who need to be informed or celebratory about transgender identities), as well as residents who are leaving their communities' temporary collective and need to connect to their next step. I want to share stories with this community about the beauty of a transgender child. Thanks for letting me stop by!

And I've never really known how to deal with it, so I just push it down try to forget and move on. I ended up doing the wrong things trying to cope with it(drinking, porn, etc.) I've dealt with most of my demons in a quest to try and become a better person in my eyes. I'm very friendly and take some small pride in being open minded and trying to help others when they need it. Because that helps me feel better about  myself. Like maybe I'm worth something, like I didn't turn out a disappointment. But I'm still depressed.

For a long while I never really realized why I felt this way. I just wanted to feel right. Comfortable with myself, be who I wanted to despite not knowing who I want to be.

Over the last couple of years I have found that I'm not comfortable with my gender. I don't really enjoy being male and think I would be a lot happier as a woman. But I'm afraid for several reasons. I live in the deep south where I have to block family members on social media cause they preach anti-lgbt propaganda and I am not about that. I honestly can't fathom how anyone would knowingly want to cause harm or section off anyone from being happy. I'm afraid of what my friends and family would think.

But I'm worried that it would be too late for me to try and transition. I'm only 25 but I'm really tall(6'3), broad shoulders, and essentially look like if a lumberjack and Seth Rogan had a child. I've had people that would be afraid to look my way cause they thought I was some kind of angry bearded monster. I'd like to transition but part of that would be me wanting to look like a woman and I'm not sure if that would be possible. I don't know.

2019-03-17 23:28:13,b2bihf,6,2,"Hello :) Im looking for tips/tricks/advice to deal with being a female that has no breast tissue. 


1. My first issue is that I can’t seem to figure out how to create the illusion of breast in a bikini. I am a cis-gender female competitive bikini athlete, but after losing 50 lbs, I have been left with absolutely no breast tissue. You can see some development in my pectoral muscles, but there’s no fat or tissue around the nipples. My chest looks like that of a person who was biologically male at birth. There’s nothing to “push up”. And when I use silicone inserts, they weigh the bikini down. I tried using pillow stuffing as well, but it looks ridiculous. Does anyone have any devices or tricks I can use to create the illusion of bust in a swimsuit?

2. I’m so torn about getting breast implants. I’ve heard that with developed pectoral muscles, you can be in chronic pain due to pressure on the implants. I’ve also heard they look weird and distort if you flex. Has anyone had that experience? I’m just trying to get peoples opinion on the “under the muscle” implants. 

3. I was told by a surgeon I should not have “over the muscle” implants because I had too little breast tissue. Has anyone without any natural breast existing prior gotten over the muscle implants? Did they look okay? Basically just wondering how the experience of “over the muscle” implants are for someone who’s flat chested. 

4. If there’s anyone who identifies as female and has no breast tissue and is okay with this, what made that possible? Without clothes I feel deformed, and not like a “real girl”. If any female who doesn’t have breasts but feels confident in her body has any sort of insight into this I would appreciate it.

Unfortunately, I’ve asked this question  to countless women and have posted this question on women’s forums sooo many times and I keep getting the same advice that is not helpful.

Until I met her I knew nothing about the trans community/knew no trans people, the closest thing is that my preteen sometimes talks about being gender fluid, and until I met my friend I had no idea what even that meant. 

We’ve become very close and she confides in me a lot, and sometimes I feel like a total ass trying to give her advice because I have never experienced anything remotely similar to what she’s going through on such a deep level. When I was a girl I wanted to be a boy for a period of time, but I outgrew it in adolescence. I don’t think telling her that would be helpful. 

I’m on the spectrum and so I already struggle with empathy. I don’t want to request that she not discuss it with me, I would like to be a good friend. I literally cannot even say, “I understand.” Because I honestly don’t. 

I think I need education, not only for this friendship but also as a parent. Is there a go-to book on this topic that your community would suggest?

Also, I would like to commend each of you for being so strong, brave, and authentic. You make life richer and more beautiful.

I don’t think telling her that would be helpful. \n\nI’m on the spectrum and so I already struggle with empathy. I don’t want to request that she not discuss it with me, I would like to be a good friend. I literally cannot even say, “I understand.” Because I honestly don’t. \n\nI think I need education, not only for this friendship but also as a parent. Is there a go-to book on this topic that your community would suggest?\n\nAlso, I would like to commend each of you for being so strong, brave, and authentic. You make life richer and more beautiful. The courage you display by just being yourselves is something I don’t even have words for.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dear ((RA's name)),

I apologize for using the 17th floor restroom. I was not aware you had a policy for restroom users. Of course I will honor your wish, as it is your floor's bathroom and not mine. However, I would like to explain a few things and hopefully clear up any misunderstandings.

I live on the 15th floor, a woman's floor, as I said before. I usually use the men's bathroom in public, but I am a transgender man, so I feel safer showering in a women's room in case anyone sees me naked. Using the 17th restroom is also much more convenient than going downstairs to use the restroom. I have never had a problem with my RA or any female residents on my floor, and I frequently see ((the Community Mentor, aka her boss)) in your restroom and she is always friendly and has never told me to leave. You said only residents can use the bathroom, but if that were the case, guests would have to go all the way to the lobby, which doesn't seem realistic. I'm assuming you really meant that only women can use the restroom. In that case, my friend ((the best friend/ the resident of the floor)) would not be able to use the restroom since they are genderqueer, not a woman. If it were based on having female anatomy, then I would be allowed to use your restroom. You see my point?

Further, the person you mentioned who showered in your restroom (tall with blue hair) is a trans woman. She dresses in masculine clothes as a safety precaution. She was spending the night at ((the best friend/ the resident))'s dorm and had nowhere else to shower. She has never caused issues in the restroom or purposely disturbed residents. While she could have gone to the 16th floor ((a men's floor)) to shower, it would have been quite humiliating for her.

I completely understand that you saw me and her and assumed the worst. I assure you, our friend would not have given us the bathroom code if we were potential threats to the 17th floor residents. (My floor also uses the same code.)

I don't mean to write this as an argument; I was genuinely shocked and upset and simply wish to explain myself. I come from a queer background. I don't believe in bathrooms separated by sex, especially given the unique gender identities of myself and my friends. I believe separating sexes by bathrooms is part of the problem. It creates a social divide between sexes. But like I said, I understand that for the majority of society, cisgender/passing men are much more likely to sexually harass women, so your concern for the safety of your residents is valid and I will respect your space. Maybe someday, men will learn to respect women's bodies, and we will not have a reason for bathrooms to be separated by sex.

I hope to have sufficiently explained my side of the situation. If you are unclear on any of my points, or if you would like to talk more about transgender bathroom rules, ways to be conscious of transgender guests/residents, or any related topics, don't hesitate to text me.

Thank you for reading and best wishes,

((My name and phone number))

One of my issues is that sometimes, when she and I are going over different exercises and stuff (she is a personal trainer), she seems to start to interact with me just like ""one of the guys"". We can have such a good time that on one occasion I got too comfortable, and by mistake after she showed me an exercise I said ""thanks man!"". I immediately cringed internally and tried to pretend I didn't say anything, because I was worried that if I explicitly apologized it would actually make the situation more awkward/worse. My boss did not seem to mind, and we continued interacting and having a good time. Situations like this have arisen a couple other times over the past year+.

&amp;#x200B;

The vibe I get from my boss seems to shift a lot depending on our moods and what we're working on. Sometimes she relates to me in a very feminine manner, other times she seems to relate to me like one of the guys.

So I'm an 18 year old male and I just recently got into cross dressing. I absolutely love it and feeling like I'm a woman just makes me feel so good inside. Secretly I have always wanted to be a woman since I was young but just always dismissed it as just sexual fantasy and nothing else. However, since I started cross dressing and pretending to be a woman I feel like it is more of a reality than I ever thought. I have a few problems though. First being that I am unsure of what to do, whether to wait a while and maybe purse HRT or just stick my life out how I am. Secondly, I would never be able to tell anyone due to my own insecurities and therefore feel like if I were to ever go through with this then I would have to disconnect myself from my family even though I know they would accept me. Thirdly, even though I really would love to be a woman, I feel like if I ever did change my mind down the line and regret it then I wouldn't be able to go back to how I am now. Finally, I would also like to have kids of my own but as far as I am aware once you are on HRT for a while it is not possible.

2019-03-22 08:34:56,b42kt5,2,3,"This post is a mess just fyi. I'm a bit torn up about my identity atm. I thought maybe I was otherkin/fictionkin but maybe I'm just also very stupid and am probably looking at this completely wrong. I just want a bit of advice and reassurance. 

--

So in this case, the character I identify as/with and really, really wish I could physically be is the Marine you play as in the original Doom 3 campaign. He has no canon name, but I'll be referring to him as Marine from here on out.
Hes human, yes. But I don't think I could ever be remotely like him because, well, I'm a girl. A short, frumpy 21 Yr old girl

I recently came to the realization that I'm not cis (like just over a year ago) and identify as non-binary so that I can use neutral pronouns, but this is only online. I can't come out because I still live with my parents who believe nb people are just stupid attention seekers, and they want me to be this curvy successful woman. And I live in a very closed minded place with absolutely no option to get out. I had enough trouble trying to come out with my sexuality, and just came out as bi to save explaining (I'm pan)

I don't want that. I try to work out to gain muscle but I tire easily and have bad joints in places. My right leg and shoulder cause the most grief. Everyone wants me to look like an office girl with cute bangs and a bob cut. The shorter I cut my hair the more people tell me off and make fun of me. I like to experiment with myself because it makes me happy, but everyone else hates it. The worst part is my chest; I'm fairly well endowed and despise every minute of it. I want to bind but it's too expensive for me to justify. 

I think now maybe I'm transmasc because of my strong connection to the Marine and desire to be more masculine and muscular in appearance. I don't want to be perceived as a tiny, weak young woman who's too nice. I've done that for far too long already.
I love wearing black and green and camo printed things. I wear gothy makeup with dark contours and always cut my nails too short so they look like a man's. My hair is getting shorter. I cosplay as my favorite characters because they make me feel a little more like myself. I haven't cosplayed the Marine yet, but I hope I can someday, once I've got the skills to make his armour and accurately sculpt my face to look even just a little like him. I'll hopefully feel myself.

Thanks for reading.",trans,(sort of X-post from r/otherkin) I think maybe I'm ftm because of idealisation/identification with video game character,1553268896.0,"{'created_utc': 1553243696, 'id': 'b42kt5', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""This post is a mess just fyi. I'm a bit torn up about my identity atm. I thought maybe I was otherkin/fictionkin but maybe I'm just also very stupid and am probably looking at this completely wrong. I just want a bit of advice and reassurance. \n\n--\n\nSo in this case, the character I identify as/with and really, really wish I could physically be is the Marine you play as in the original Doom 3 campaign. He has no canon name, but I'll be referring to him as Marine from here on out.\nHes human, yes. But I don't think I could ever be remotely like him because, well, I'm a girl. A short, frumpy 21 Yr old girl\n\nI recently came to the realization that I'm not cis (like just over a year ago) and identify as non-binary so that I can use neutral pronouns, but this is only online. I can't come out because I still live with my parents who believe nb people are just stupid attention seekers, and they want me to be this curvy successful woman. And I live in a very closed minded place with absolutely no option to get out. I had enough trouble trying to come out with my sexuality, and just came out as bi to save explaining (I'm pan)\n\nI don't want that. I try to work out to gain muscle but I tire easily and have bad joints in places. My right leg and shoulder cause the most grief. Everyone wants me to look like an office girl with cute bangs and a bob cut. The shorter I cut my hair the more people tell me off and make fun of me. I like to experiment with myself because it makes me happy, but everyone else hates it. The worst part is my chest; I'm fairly well endowed and despise every minute of it. I want to bind but it's too expensive for me to justify. \n\nI think now maybe I'm transmasc because of my strong connection to the Marine and desire to be more masculine and muscular in appearance.

2019-03-23 03:51:36,b4el5o,2,3,"Hey everyone,

All my life I have always had the thought in the back of my head that my life would be better if I was born a woman and I honestly wish that I was. However, due to my own insecurities I do not know if I'd be able to muster up the courage to act on these feelings. But I have seriously been considering it recently and plan on speaking to a therapist to really lay things out in the near future. I just had a few questions related to being a MtF just in case I do decide to go through with it which I hope that I do. I know I can search this on Google, and believe me I have been relentlessly, but I just wanted advice and answers from the people that I can relate to.

1. How hard is it to get on HRT? I have seen some people say that they have been waiting almost a year.
2. I'm not sure if I would ever be able to bring myself to get SRS so what kind of effects does HRT have on your penis?
3. For my breasts I'd like to have a C cup at least so what size do breasts normally grow to on MtF's?
4. If my breasts were to not grow to my desired size then how much do implants generally cost to get to a C cup size?
5. Finally, do you guys have any recommendations on how to overcome this feeling that I would never be able to tell anyone about this and therefore not act upon on due to the fear of losing those around me? I know my parents would accept me as they have previously said no matter who or what you are we will always love you but I still feel like it would just be a lot for them to deal with. They are not transphobic by any means but I guess it is down to my own pessimism of always thinking of the worst outcome of each situation.

2019-03-23 21:20:44,b4oe7v,4,5,"I am experimenting with my gender identity, since I’ve been masculine almost my whole life. I am going by the name Markus.

I wonder if what I’m feeling is normal for people. I always imagined myself as a guy, and I always make my characters in videogames be male if possible. In my muses when I write, I always make myself into a man. I wish to have a flat chest, even if it isn’t that large. I’m an athlete, and have played field hockey and found myself uncomfortable wearing the skirts that come with our uniforms. I became goalie, and I enjoyed it, because I’ve always wanted to be large, intimidating, and dominant. I want to be powerful. I even joined wrestling. 

I wish to be taller than I am, to have bigger hands. Is this body dysmorphia? Because I certainly don’t hate my face, and I don’t think I’m too fat. I’m proud of my strong arms and legs, and my broad shoulders. I love that I was born with a relatively deep voice, although sometimes I wish it could be a bit deeper. I’m worried about taking testosterone, because I might lose my singing voice. I’m a musician, I love rock and experimental. I wouldn’t mind it if I got more body hair, although my family has a tendency to lose hair more soon than most. Testosterone would probably yeet my hair away. I love short haircuts, my favorite being undercuts. I push my hair back to make my forehead look bigger, because I know that guys have larger foreheads.

I’m not sure about having a penis. I take prescription medication which has practically slaughtered my libido. I’m pretty sure I’m dominant, and that I don’t want to be penetrated. Sexuality is a bit weird for me, so I can’t say much in that department.

Things become muddled when I consider that my traumatic life has caused me to disassociate. Life feels like I’m behind a glass wall that I made to protect myself from the world. It’s hard to feel like I’m really somewhere, even though I may accept that I’m in a place. I deny myself of a lucid life, and instead live through like a dream. It’s the most infuriating and frustrating feeling in the world, that I can’t simply be without distancing myself.

I became goalie, and I enjoyed it, because I’ve always wanted to be large, intimidating, and dominant. I want to be powerful. I even joined wrestling. \n\nI wish to be taller than I am, to have bigger hands. Is this body dysmorphia? Because I certainly don’t hate my face, and I don’t think I’m too fat. I’m proud of my strong arms and legs, and my broad shoulders. I love that I was born with a relatively deep voice, although sometimes I wish it could be a bit deeper. I’m worried about taking testosterone, because I might lose my singing voice. I’m a musician, I love rock and experimental. I wouldn’t mind it if I got more body hair, although my family has a tendency to lose hair more soon than most. Testosterone would probably yeet my hair away. I love short haircuts, my favorite being undercuts. I push my hair back to make my forehead look bigger, because I know that guys have larger foreheads.\n\nI’m not sure about having a penis. I take prescription medication which has practically slaughtered my libido. I’m pretty sure I’m dominant, and that I don’t want to be penetrated. Sexuality is a bit weird for me, so I can’t say much in that department.\n\nThings become muddled when I consider that my traumatic life has caused me to disassociate. Life feels like I’m behind a glass wall that I made to protect myself from the world. It’s hard to feel like I’m really somewhere, even though I may accept that I’m in a place. I deny myself of a lucid life, and instead live through like a dream. It’s the most infuriating and frustrating feeling in the world, that I can’t simply be without distancing myself.\n\nCan someone please help me figure out my feelings?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am I Transgender?

2019-03-24 03:03:03,b4rpkx,4,2,"Hello, r/trans


Trying to navigate the intricacies of gender is something I've tried hard to do ever since I was made aware and I'm trying my best to understand the hardships of acceptance many face, be it from themselves or others. And since (thankfully) awareness has been spreading, it's only right I should learn what I can to be more accommodating so we can all finally get along on this damn rock we all call home. So I come to you with a doozy (for me) of a question.



I have two friends, who are a couple, that I haven't spoken to in some time (adulthood and work keeping us busy in our own affairs and all that). Just recently I heard one of them (previously the girlfriend) has been going down transition road to become a male. They have changed their name, started hormone replacement, the whole shebang. 



Now again it has been a few years since I last saw either of them, and I am curious; do I acknowledge his previous identity and act as old friends, or try to act as though I am speaking to a new person? I know that sounds ignorant, and I'm leaning towards simply calling him by his new name, and just carrying on like we always have...but there's a part of me in the back of my mind that just says ""what if you're wrong, ICall_Bullshit?""


I don't want to go behind his back and see what other friends have done as I feel that is disrespectful and disingenuous. I would rather talk to him face to face, simply call them by their new name, just accept their new identity, and carry on. But does that feel as if I'm brushing off the transition?

As the tile says, he is on the spectrum. i’m pretty sure he has asburgers (i don’t know how to spell it sorry) and he’s basically a genius. he has a high paying job and knows how to save and budget his money. we’ve almost paid off our house and both our cars are paid off. we still live in the same home we moved into when i was 11 months old even though we could easily afford something much nicer. he doesn’t show off his money which is what i like about him. he drives a car they stopped making in like 2007 or something. One of he biggest things with him being on the spectrum is that he has a really big issue with anything being permanent, is his head, anything can change and i see his point. However i am 100% sure i’m transgender and my fear is that he will think it’s just a phase or something i’ll grow out of.  I suffer from other mental illnesses besides gender dysphoria. i am diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms and a generalized anxiety disorder, i also show signs of OCD and a lot of people in my family have it. i’m not saying i do since i’m not diagnosed but there’s a good possibility i do.  my depression and psychosis are treated with medicine that works pretty well besides the annoying side affects. however all of this stacked ontop of my crippling dysphoria, makes daily life almost unbearable. my mom have talked about me going on hormones and she’s very supportive of it, but i have to tell my dad. my worry is that he will feel like he’s losing control and try to take control of my transition. him and i don’t always get along very well and my home life has not always been the best. let’s just say i’m going to move out as soon as i’m able to. I want to be in charge on my own body and i cannot live like i am anymore. additionally, his father died in February which is just the icing on top isn’t it? i’ve written a draft of a letter i want to give to him, i’m thinking of giving it to him this weekend because il staying with my sister and it would give him a few days to process it. does anyone else here have parents on the spectrum? how was is coming out to them? how to i transition without him controlling it? how can u assure him i’m sure i’m trans and that this is the best thing for me right now? is it even the right time to tell him? i just need any advice please. i am a sophomore in high school and i want to go on hormones over the summer so i can come back junior year as a boy.  thanks for any advice or support, sorry this is long and jumbled, im on mobile and i’m not a great writer.
also let me note, i am not on the autism spectrum so is anyone on here is/ has asburgers some advice would be really great on how i can better understand his feelings.

They were recently, and briefly, hospitalized for some unrelated (she thinks) issues. As a gay man, I advised her that when I was closeted, I hoped every day that somebody would ask me if I was gay, and that maybe her son does want to tell her, but feels awkward bringing it up. She is known to be very accepting and a loving mother, and feels as though she could help with their transition. She does not want to make them feel uncomfortable by asking however. Since I am not trans, I can't tell her what the right thing to do is, so I have a couple questions for anybody who is willing to answer.

Does it 100% mean that they are transitioning? 

Is there any other reason a teenage boy would take estrogen pills? 

Did you ever hope that your parents would ask you and nudge you in the direction of coming out? 

Or, was it a journey that only you could take, and come out when the time was right?

2019-03-26 02:10:22,b5jxqe,2,5,"God, I've got a lot to say tonight tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

So I came out at work as a guy on Sunday 24th. My boss took it super well and asked what name I'd like to use from now on, how soon I want them to use ""he/him/his"" and yeah, it went great! Yay! I'll be telling other colleagues when I go back in on Thursday this week as technically the boss I told is my OLD department boss and so I need to tell my new department boss and probably the store manager and blah blah blah, as well as the other colleagues who I interact with more often, haha. (I've just moved off bakery, which I've hated and has caused me stress for over a year!! and have moved onto checkouts only finally).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going by Alex with friends for well over a month now, which is nice. I've started introducing myself as Alexander when I meet new people (I get tingles when they repeat my name back to me, it's great, even though a quarter of the time they look confused). I've joined a LGBTQ+ group on Wednesday evenings, and I'm starting some therapy for unrelated reasons on Wednesday mornings but yay I'm super happy about that so I thought I'd throw it in anyway lol. Like, this whole thing is super confusing, but living as a man and being referred to as a guy is just so satisfying and makes me insanely happy and almost giddy, haha. My sister even referred to me as her sibling the other day after accidentally calling me her sister, which was lovely of her; even if she can't say ""brother"" yet, the fact that she's trying is incredible cause we've always been super close and I suppose this will affect it in some way, but it's nice to see that it shouldn't be a huge deal.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also starting trans-specific counselling on a Thursday evening in a month or two hopefully too. I'm still waiting on a call back, but fingers crossed it's sooner rather than later.

&amp;#x200B;

Umm, I think I mentioned before that I've told my parents. They won't use my pronouns or new name right now cos they're scared they'll slip up in front of the extended family, who don't know anything just yet. I'll be sitting them down for a talk after I've been to a Gender Identity Clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently living as a man, been binding every day for about 3+ weeks (don't worry, not for more than 7 hours a day; I put it on before work, take it off after when I get home... I just can't stand wearing a bra or really many obviously women's clothes anymore :( ... I have to tonight for a gig and I'm dreading it, help) Anyway. I've got new name badges printed at work, I'm out to my family and friends though my extended family doesn't know as we almost know they'll either tell me I'm deranged or try to convince me out of it or something, Idk. Like I said, I'll be talking to them about that properly after a first GIC appointment and some advice, haha. Might take mum along to my appointment when I get one, actually, cause you can take a trusted family member and I think it'd be easier for her to hear from a professional who knows what they're talking about rather than a 23 year old armed only with Internet knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to my questions, I guess:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I need to be referred by my GP for a Gender Identity Clinic appointment? 
2. Does anyone in the UK know if there's a clinic in the South West that isn't all the way down in Devon?
3. Is there usually a waiting list? 
4. Does living as my preferred gender for any length of time speed up the process at all? 
5. I've documented when I've come out and to who, as well as a couple other things such as my specific personal dysphoria; will that help? 
6. What questions should I definitely ask?
7. I know I need to do a blood test when I get there, or before; what do they actually look for?
8. I'm overweight, will that change anything at all negatively? I've been working out every morning and trying to eat better, don't have diabetes or any health conditions due to my weight besides asthma, so I'm hoping that'll help a little.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's it. I've just obviously never been through this, so I'm not too sure what these appointments look for/do or how to even go about getting an appointment, etc.

2019-03-27 01:29:04,b5y9kl,11,2,"I'm 18 and closeted &amp; I knew I was trans since I was around 15.
Recently I've been kinda doubting myself. Thinking I'm not ""trans enough"" or that my dysphoria isnt strong enough or worth transitioning for. I try to think of my life in the future where i live as a woman, and its honeslty pathetic and sad. It gives me no emotion, just emptiness and maybe regret. My future as a guy is obviously much happier. I also wonder what if im not dysphoric but im actually having body dysmorphia? (Ill get into that later)

Basically I am searching for a weak ass excuse to 'not really be trans' and give up on it just cause I'm scared of my parents and everyone i know not accepting me



Okay, little childhood flashbacks. When I was little I was quite ""androgynous"" in behaviour (id play with blocks, id draw, id play with insects, but id also let my mom put me into dresses (i didnt care about clothes much)) &amp; also I remember when i was 9 i was REALLY against playing with barbies cause those were girl toys. My mom got me some and id play with them in secret, embarrassed if anyone even saw me near them. My brother got a ken doll once and i kept on stealing him because i was jealous. (Idk i just find that story interesting)
Anyways i always considered myself ""a tomboy"" compared to other girls in my class. I acted more tough and strong and hated appearing feminine or anything like that. Around the age of 13 i started addressing myself as a guy online (it all started cause i wanted to catfish... as a guy?? Dont ask, i dont know) and i found a name that i quite liked. I... still use that name online. Its a name i grew up with, literally. Ive been using it for 5 years or more. I'm trying to keep this short but im failing. Im just ranting now. Anyways.

I found out im trans when i actually found out about trans people. I remember reading about what they are and what they feel like and i was thinking ""no that is not me""... i ended up doing online quizzes (i know thats a bad resource but i was desperate) and praying u dont get the results of me being trans (i did) This was during the time when i was calling myself a guy online too. After school ended i cut my hair and started binding once i got into high school.
Now i dont know is it because of my appearance or age but in middle school i was always more quiet and laid back, shy... but after my mini transformation i became confident. I was digging looking like a dude, and i even took more than 3 selfies (before i used to think selfies were something girls did and id be caught dead taking selfies... tbh i still think that. I just never see guys taking selfies at school)

Now onto my dysphoria. I think I have both body and social dysphoria. When I'm home i dont bind (i wear a sports bra) mainly bc i bind for 6 hours at school every day and at home i like to lay a lot (&amp; laying in a binder is not comfortable AT ALL). Before this, i never had any issues with my body. But i think dysphoria kinda triggered some body dysmorphia. I can difference them. I started getting dysmorphic when i realized that my thighs arent as thin as cis guys thighs, or that my waist isnt as straight as a cis guys, or how most cis guys have a slim face... basically i think me losing weight would make me more of a guy. But theres a part of me that doubts this and thinks that once i lose weight i wont feel any problems and ""wont be trans"". It probably sounds stupid. I also got bullied for my weight in middle school (it didnt affect me though, no one bullies me now). 
I am dysohoric about my body. The way i walk, talk, my voice is feminine/androgynous and not masculine, i have a baby face, my chest isnt flat / its too big, my hands are small, i dont have natural testosterone muscle, my thighs and hips arent masculine, i should wear a shoe size bigger etc... but sometimes when i come out of the shower or get dressed, my thoughts are blank about my body. I dont like it. I just... suck it up. Thats what i always do. Suck it up and avoid the problem in hopes of it going away. When i get misgendered by strangers i feel bad and sulk and wonder what about me ""gave it away""? But i get misgendered daily by friends and family (im not out) and i always suck it up or ignore it. But because i managed to ignore the problem for so long i started to think i could do this. Forever. Pretend like me talking about myself or others adressing me with the wrong pronouns doesnt bother me. I try not to talk about myself or try to find a way where i word my sentence and dont mention any pronouns.

It feels kind of really pathetic. I should also mention that my parents kinda found out im trans when i was 16, thought i was going through a phrase and sent me to a psychologist (who didnt help) but then completely avoided and ignored the issue after that. They think its their fault. My friends kinda know, but I never asked them to use the right pronouns (since im not out to everyone).

Whenever i go through reddit and see all these trans people who came out and got on hormones, or went to a therapist, changed their name etc, just got to be themselves, i get really sad. Like okay they got lucky but i wont. I just dont see a bright future and dont think its worth it. Im not suicidal but death sometimes sounds way better than disappointing my parents and not having support. If i had supportive parents i think my story wouldve headed a different direction. I hope to one day actually transition and get on hormones, but what if I'm making a bad choice? What if my life falls apart and my parents get scolded by other people because of me? What if they lose their jobs? What if i realize this isnt right for me? What if my problems fade in two years? I'm just in a tough spot right now.

Im finishing high school this year, then maybe ill have to move to go to college. But im not sure. I hoped to start college as who i am, but that probably wont happen.

2019-03-27 04:35:37,b601zv,5,12,"*I know the title says allies, but trans people can respond, too. I just tend to feel more understood and heard by people going through a same/similar situation to me, but any advice/help is valued and appreciated.*

I'm going to be honest, I am ... really ashamed of this. It's hard for me to talk about. It's hard for me to admit. And Goddamn, it's hard for me to share on a subreddit full of trans people and allies.

I ... am trying to be an ally, but I fucking suck at it ... It's hard to talk about, so I'm going to keep this brief because I'm already crying, but long story short, anything transgender makes me feel ... awful. Like, the feeling to me is akin to walking through a thick mass of cobwebs. Both terrifying and gross feeling. I've gotten better about acknowledging the transition/preferred pronouns of my online friends (though it's still uncomfortable, for me I've gotten to a feeling of say it, cringe, and move on), but my best friend/roommate/practically a sister to me (MtF) came out online a few months ago and is now taking little steps to transition in real life, too (came out to her parents, bought a purse and some jeans today).

She actually asked me to come with her to go clothes shopping on Sunday (for the trip today). Unintentionally, my first response was to panic and say, ""You know, physically, those won't fit you correct? Either the hips will be too big, or the legs will be too short."" I felt bad about it afterward, but I panicked and spat out what, logically, I thought the answer would be. Afterwards we hashed it out and I explained I just wasn't comfortable on a trip like that, but it made me start to question if my discomfort was selfish or not. 

I grew up in a Conservative Christian household that doesn't hate LGBTQ people, per se, but doesn't encourage it, either. Still, I didn't have *too* terrible a problem when another friend of mine came out as gay, or my online friends came out as trans. But now that she's wanting to spend time with me in public as a she scares and makes me more uncomfortable than calling her she physically ... Part of the problem is I have harm OCD (an OCD type where you're constantly worried about causing harm to others) and part of me wonders if the fear feeling I get is due to that (I'm afraid I'll offend all the other Conservative Christians by walking around with a currently-physically male person holding a purse)?

It\'s hard for me to talk about. It\'s hard for me to admit.

It\'s hard to talk about, so I\'m going to keep this brief because I\'m already crying, but long story short, anything transgender makes me feel ... awful. Like, the feeling to me is akin to walking through a thick mass of cobwebs. Both terrifying and gross feeling. I\'ve gotten better about acknowledging the transition/preferred pronouns of my online friends (though it\'s still uncomfortable, for me I\'ve gotten to a feeling of say it, cringe, and move on), but my best friend/roommate/practically a sister to me (MtF) came out online a few months ago and is now taking little steps to transition in real life, too (came out to her parents, bought a purse and some jeans today).\n\nShe actually asked me to come with her to go clothes shopping on Sunday (for the trip today). Unintentionally, my first response was to panic and say, ""You know, physically, those won\'t fit you correct? Either the hips will be too big, or the legs will be too short."" I felt bad about it afterward, but I panicked and spat out what, logically, I thought the answer would be. Afterwards we hashed it out and I explained I just wasn\'t comfortable on a trip like that, but it made me start to question if my discomfort was selfish or not. \n\nI grew up in a Conservative Christian household that doesn\'t hate LGBTQ people, per se, but doesn\'t encourage it, either. Still, I didn\'t have *too* terrible a problem when another friend of mine came out as gay, or my online friends came out as trans. But now that she\'s wanting to spend time with me in public as a she scares and makes me more uncomfortable than calling her she physically ... Part of the problem is I have harm OCD (an OCD type where you\'re constantly worried about causing harm to others) and part of me wonders if the fear feeling I get is due to that (I\'m afraid I\'ll offend all the other Conservative Christians by walking around with a currently-physically male person holding a purse)?\n\nPart of it is probably an ego/image thing, but there\'s another part of it I can\'t write off so easily that is really, really bothering me.

2019-03-28 02:33:39,b6dcwm,8,0,"I’ve finally decided that I want to transition from a boy to a girl, and it’s taken me 39 years to figure this out. I can’t stop thinking that I would be better as a girl and I would look and feel better too. I’m having recurring dreams that I’m a girl and I don’t want to wake up. I can’t help but dress up everytime I have alone time. Then I just look at myself and try and imagine myself as a girl, but then I have to go to bed and take off all the makeup and I’m sad. I want to wear skirts and dresses to work every day, but I don’t want to lose my job over it. 

But my biggest problem is that I have a wife who dislikes my cross dressing and is openly hostile to me expressing that side of myself. Her fear is that I will end up becoming “gay” and have sex with other people. I’ve always felt that if she was ok with my sexuality then we could integrate it into our relationship, but that’s naive of me to think that another person would be that accepting. She has a right to reject seeing her husband as a girl and I respect that, but I don’t agree. Her denial has pushed me further away to the point that I really would consider having sex with someone else if they would love me for my true self. 

On the flip side, I feel immense guilt over this whole thing. As if, I was lying to everyone for all these years and I should’ve known at a young age I was trans. But I was too afraid to admit it myself- I’ve been lying to myself for my whole life. I also feel like I’m only doing this for sexual reasons and that makes it morally wrong. Maybe too much of a Christian upbringing, but I feel all this guilt about it. I don’t want to transition only for sexual reasons, but sometimes it feels like my sexuality is what is dictating my life and I have to accept that first before I can find my true self.

I want to wear skirts and dresses to work every day, but I don’t want to lose my job over it. \n\nBut my biggest problem is that I have a wife who dislikes my cross dressing and is openly hostile to me expressing that side of myself. Her fear is that I will end up becoming “gay” and have sex with other people. I’ve always felt that if she was ok with my sexuality then we could integrate it into our relationship, but that’s naive of me to think that another person would be that accepting. She has a right to reject seeing her husband as a girl and I respect that, but I don’t agree. Her denial has pushed me further away to the point that I really would consider having sex with someone else if they would love me for my true self. \n\nOn the flip side, I feel immense guilt over this whole thing. As if, I was lying to everyone for all these years and I should’ve known at a young age I was trans. But I was too afraid to admit it myself- I’ve been lying to myself for my whole life. I also feel like I’m only doing this for sexual reasons and that makes it morally wrong. Maybe too much of a Christian upbringing, but I feel all this guilt about it. I don’t want to transition only for sexual reasons, but sometimes it feels like my sexuality is what is dictating my life and I have to accept that first before I can find my true self. \n\nI just don’t want to hide it anymore. I’m ready to face my transexuality head on and find out where it leads me but I’m afraid because of my family and all these guilt feelings.

2019-03-28 03:34:13,b6dxfx,3,6,"Hi everyone. So I'm a transman and I'm trying to get my co-workers to use my chosen name instead of my birth name. Because there's no rule that says your new name has to be derived from your old name, I picked a completely unrelated name that I love. 

Apparently that's unacceptable because my chosen name, Dominic, apparently doesn't fit. My last name is very Polish, and they say Dominic is far too Italian to pair with my Polish last name. It's so funny to me because my birth name was Stephanie, which is freaking GREEK. But apparently that's acceptable lmao. It's like these baby boomers will latch on to anything they can to prove to themselves that my transition is a bad idea. 

They ask why I don't just pick something easier and derivative, like Stephan or Steve. When I say they missed the boat on the naming game they get all offended, like I should have asked for their blessing. My friends and family have been calling me Dominic for a year, and my mother, the woman who named me when I was born, personally approved of my new name. My wife loves it, my mother loves it, my grandmother loves it, and my siblings love it.

Too bad for you, coworker dudes. Get with the times. I'll be lenient with their lack of effort up until the exact minute I get my legal gender marker and name changed, at which point their options will be A) treat me with respect and use my legal name and pronouns, or B) watch me slam you with a discrimination lawsuit.

I keep trying to explain that I'm doing them a favour by encouraging them to practice and get comfortable with this at their own speed, before they're legally obliged. But there's only one guy there that makes any effort. He's my favourite coworker cause he calls me Tough Guy.

Just wanted to kind of get this off my chest. Usually I can deal with their bullshit, because I'm finally secure in myself and my own identity.

I've decided on waiting until I can afford an apartment on my own so I can have some stability. A few months ago a friend came to me with some concerns. Shes pregnant and worried that calling me by my chosen name and masculine pronouns would be confusing for her children and make them question their own gender before they're old enough. She wanted me to go by feminine pronouns and my birth names unless I transitioned and then stay stealth until she was ready to explain to them.

A couple weeks later a relented since I wouldn't be out publicly anyway, at least not for the time being.

Everything seemed fine until a couple days after that when I got a long angry text about how I still clearly wasn't over the fight even though I got my way despite her feelings and stance on the subject ( I asked if we could still use my chosen name as it can pass for a nickname while still using feminine pronouns and referring to me as a female). I explained to her I was swamped with work, not ignoring her and she apologized, immediately going off about how unfair it was that I had so much work to do then that was that.

I've never really tried coming onto an online community to talk about this stuff. I don't really know the terminology about these topics well, so please forgive me if I sound ignorant or vague.

I was born a male and would like to know how to go about logically transitioning from male to female.

I was heavily invested in this idea since I was small, watching cartoons, I was extremely interested in certain gimmicky episodes where there was a ""gender bender"" trope. It intrigued me to see what the other side was like.

At first, it was merely faint, and I did not really know what it meant. The ideas were further perpetuated by my discovery of ""transformation"" fetish on Youtube and DeviantArt. It became a guilty pleasure that I masturbated to since I was in elementary school. No one really knew, and my parents thought it wasn't strange for a growing ""boy"", never checking my interests or watch history.

The idea only grew more as I graduated elementary school. Around this time, I kind of grew an awakening towards the world, and was very paranoid of the future, my future to be exact. All the while, I had kept those feelings bottled within me. The period between middle school and high school was a depressing time.

I eventually came out to my parents, who were accepting of the idea, but didn't really know how to help me.

I never really tried crossdressing or trying on women's clothes, except for one time as a child. I also never talked to an online community or researched into the idea more than just fantasizing about it.

2019-03-31 18:30:03,b7qxy0,1,0,"Hello everyone! Im 16, mtf, and my name is Wren. Up until this year, I had gotten off pretty lucky with Testosterone poisoning. But my body is giving me signs that I'm about to enter Tanner 5 (the final stage of development,) and it's really freaking me out. 

I'm starting to develop facial hair on my upper lip, and body hair on my lower abdomen and chest. I thought that I could just wait until I graduated high school to transition, but I can't do this. I'm in my Junior year, but I won't turn 18 until 2021. If I let Testosterone continue to ravage my body, I'll have course facial hair by the time I graduate.

I know what I need to do. I've been doing research on hrt for the last 6 months, and I think I'm going to self medicate. I know it's not the best option, but I can't do this anymore. If I continue to develop into a man,  I'm going to kill myself. I know that sounds dark, but this is my reality.

Transitioning is a matter of life and death for me.


I fully understand the risks that come with self medicating, and I'm willing to accept it. I've taking advanced Chemistry, Biology, and I understand how this medication will interact with my body.

I would be taking Spironolactone and Estradiol. Starting with low dose of Spiro, and raising it for a month. Then starting on a low dose of Estrogen. If. You want to know my treatment plan in detail, look at my post history.

I know that taking Estrogen will increase the fat in my blood. I don't smoke, and I run cross country. My height is 5' 11"" and my weight is 140lbs. So I'm planning on staying active to reduce the risk of complications.

I know that cypro is better than Spironolactone, but I've heard it can cause depression-like symptoms. I'm taking lexipro for depression, so I don't want to mess with that.

I also know that hrt will make me infertile. And I don't care. It would be nice to be able to bank my sperm, but I have no access to that as I minor.

I'm sorry if this bummed you out, but I really need some advice. If you can't, then I would really appreciate some support. I'm just really scared.
