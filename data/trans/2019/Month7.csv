2019-07-01 00:46:24,c7ly15,2,2,"I don’t really know if people post stories much on here, but I really want to just rant to people who might understand better than my family. 

I finally came out to both my parents as a trans male. I’ve been out to my mom for over a year, my dad for a month. I figured since my dad had such a good reaction, and my mom had known about it so long, it was a good time to open up conversation about HRT, since it’s notorious for taking sometimes years to be accessible. When I brought it up very seriously and carefully with my mom, she refused to discuss it, only letting me know that “You are not of an age where you can make that decision.” (I’m 16). My dad, on the other hand, brought it up in a series of questions on the way to my grandmother’s. They might have seemed too prying to some people, asking about my sexuality, about if I’m just a non-feminine woman, and then of course, asking about if I ever planned on transitioning medically. I always thought my dad would have my back on this, but when I told him about really wanting to peruse HRT now (to be educated on prices and start on the process), I saw him get tense and kind of make a noise in the back of his throat. He then went on a long rant, which included using things I had said to him in coming out, to tell me why I didn’t need to medically transition, and how I should just be happy with male clothes and haircut. He told me I shouldn’t worry about my main concern, my voice, and that I should just be happy like this (I wish dysphoria was that easy, lol). I described to him how it was less so that I’m upset about myself, and more so that I’m upset about how people see me, and that even in an accepting world, people are still going to misgender me, which hurts. He just continued to tell me about why I shouldn’t transition medically, such as telling me surgery is dangerous, also assuming that I would pursue bottom surgery. I told him the surgery I want to get (double mastectomy) has been around for a long enough time and been used enough that it should be safe, plus it doesn’t remove anything major, which was part of his concern for some reason. He told me I don’t need it because I’m flat chested (little does he know, I wear binders.) I didn’t know how to support the safeness of HRT, so he just further dismissed it. My dad, more or less, stopped talking about it because I burst into tears because I couldn’t explain to him my feelings, telling me he didn’t want me to “cry in front of family.”

I know this isn’t a death sentence for me getting HRT, but it’s a good indicator that I’ll be doing this on my own, when I’m 18+. I know many trans women and men transition later in life, and are just as valid as those who started in high school, and that there’s worse I could be facing, but it’s just so frustrating that they don’t understand how important it is to me.

2019-07-01 03:35:36,c7nlps,1,0,"(this post might be a bit crude with sexual topics warning. sorry)

So this post is going to be unfiltered with my true feelings and emotions which is a rare thing for me to do and admit. I have a lot of things bottled up that not even my closest friends or family are aware of in the slightest. I feel like the next year is a critical year for my life journey and I don't want to get it wrong.

  
I'm 26 years old and have been male/identified as male all my life. I don't act feminine around my family in the slightest and don't really have any gay/trans friends. I love doing manly things like sports, roughing around with the fam, and trash talk and up until about 2 years ago never even considered the option of a transition. I have never had a girlfriend in my life, I had one stint in college that lasted 2 weeks with a girl but it didn't work out. I actually dont think I'm an unattractive person in the slightest, but I'm very insecure and unconfident especially around women because of the cycle of loneliness and fear of social awkwardness, and one more embarrassing thing which I will mention in the next paragraph. I feel very lonely, depressed, and hurt and if there was a button I could press to stop existing so that my family never knew I existed, I would press it now in an instant. But there's not. I feel like I have to make a change in my life, and I'm trying to decide if transitioning is the right move.

One of the reasons I lack confidence is because....to put it lightly.....my small.......appendage (chem chem). I didn't start ""stroking the rooster"" until around 16 because it was always too small for pleasure. Up until around 19, I thought I might have a micropenis (i know...everyone finds it funny but it makes me want to kill myself) and this led to further depression and suicidal thoughts. However, after doing some research, I'm not sure its quite small enough to be diagnosed as that. it grows to around 4 inches erect, and is around 1 inch soft (and sometimes feels like it doesn't even stick out). Like, I understand this is unpleasant to hear, but the first time I am admitting this, and I believe its a critical part of this post and reason why I might transition. People and therapists have asked me why I'm so depressed in the past  and I cannot tell them why...it's just too embarrassing. This fact has led me to seek alternate pleasures, and at 16, I started experimenting with anal play. I loved it to be honest, although I always still considered myself attracted to women.

  
Across the span of 5-6 years, my sexual interests now include Trans and cis-women (I think i used the correct term there - sorry this is all new to me). However, until recently I didn't realize how pleasurable it was to possibly act like a woman/trans. It feels right and really turns me on sexually. I have now crossdressed and the experience almost makes me blush thinking about it. On top of that, I feel like I could make a really cute/sexy girl, even with minimal HRT treatment. I may have gynecomastia already as some family/friends have noticed. The woman in my family have very large breasts (DD+) and my dad has low testosterone/high estrogen levels compared to the average man. I really feel like I may be happier as a woman, people would be attracted to me for once in my life and I might not be lonely. My (potentially) large breasts and sexiness would compensate for my small appendage.  I would even consider dating a man if I felt that feminine. 

Here's the kicker. I am questioning whether this is just some kinky pent up sexual frustration or a real avenue to pursue. When you all decided to be trans, what percentage of it was sexual in nature versus just another type of feeling. I feel guilty for doing it for the wrong reasons. After all, I would be happy as a man if I had a larger appendage, more hair, and no man boobs. Some of those factors could act as a benefit in transition. To be honest, I have no idea about how to go about getting HRT or how I would tell my parents, family, and friends. It would be the ultimate embarrassment and awkwardness of my nightmares and I would probably damage the true relationship with at least my dad even though he would probably accept it. It wouldn't be the same. I'm also afraid jobs wouldn't hire me and it would affect my career. My life is already in shambles and I need to figure it out. My career is going nowhere, I have no friends, I don't go out, I don't date or use dating apps, and I'm obsessed with the wrong things.

He brought some Elton John records to listen to also which was awesome. We hung out and listened to some music and I put on the Laura Jane Grace and the Devouring Mother’s album and started talking about why I’ve been so distant lately. I told him about my dysphoria and some back story about my parents and how they were to me when I was younger. I told him I’m questioning my gender and sexuality, and just like I suspected he was super cool about everything!! I always knew he’d be open to me but it was still the hardest thing I’ve ever done!

&amp;#x200B;

Friday 28th

On Friday I got my 1st haircut to trim my hair. It looked like a really bad mullet so I wanted to get it trimmed up in a way that looks decent and I can grow it out well. I made a appointment the day before. The hairdresser did a amazing job and I loved how it looked. Later in the day I went with my stepmom and one of my sisters to go shopping. We started with getting our eyebrows threaded. Even though it was my 1st time it wasn't so painful. After my face looked way better. We then went to a makeup store where the store associate helped me with makeup products and put some on me. I honestly couldn't believe I could look like that, and while I still don't think I was passable I still looked way better than like ever before lol. After that was shopping for clothes. I tried on a bunch of stuff and found out my shoulders aren't actually as large as I thought. I was getting weird looks from some people and some smiles from others. I ended up getting a decent amount of clothes. So while it definitely was a costly day it was well worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday 29th

I was going to a family party (uncle and aunts anniversary) and really wanted to present somewhat. So I wore this pink flowy shirt and some styled torn up jeans. I wore a bra of course but didn't want to shock my extended family with the presence of boobs. This was the 1st time they had seen me in like 7 months and the 1st time they would see me after finding out I'm transitioning. Because of this I wore a androgynous zip up jacket I have had for a few years. While I did get a few weird looks from some of my aunt and uncles friends I really didn't care. My extended family ended up being super supportive even though they were more than a little bit shocked when they heard. I ended up shoeing one of my aunts pictures from the day before and she said ""You look amazing... omg it's like you were meant to be a girl!"" I still feel like I didn't pass in that picture but it still was an nice comment to receive.

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday 30th

I had plans to go to pride with my other sister who's only 2 years younger than me. She was planning on going with her boyfriend, her boyfriends friend, one of her friends and me if I would go. I wore a shirt and the jeans from the evening before. The shirts sleeves ended on my forearms and had a section displaying way more of my upper chest than I ever displayed before (no boobage was visible and I was wearing a bra. It was easy to tell I have boobs from the side or front of me because the shirt was stylized to be somewhat tight. We ended up watching a good amount of the parade even though it was insanely crowded. Once we actually got inside the party area we just walked around and saw some very interesting people in various states of dress or undress (I guess that is just how pride is lol). The music everywhere sucked but that's because most people like shitty music (that is just my opinion as a person who prefers metal and some rock over anything else.)

It looked like a really bad mullet so I wanted to get it trimmed up in a way that looks decent and I can grow it out well. I made a appointment the day before. The hairdresser did a amazing job and I loved how it looked. Later in the day I went with my stepmom and one of my sisters to go shopping. We started with getting our eyebrows threaded. Even though it was my 1st time it wasn\'t so painful. After my face looked way better. We then went to a makeup store where the store associate helped me with makeup products and put some on me. I honestly couldn\'t believe I could look like that, and while I still don\'t think I was passable I still looked way better than like ever before lol. After that was shopping for clothes. I tried on a bunch of stuff and found out my shoulders aren\'t actually as large as I thought. I was getting weird looks from some people and some smiles from others. I ended up getting a decent amount of clothes. So while it definitely was a costly day it was well worth it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSaturday 29th\n\nI was going to a family party (uncle and aunts anniversary) and really wanted to present somewhat. So I wore this pink flowy shirt and some styled torn up jeans. I wore a bra of course but didn\'t want to shock my extended family with the presence of boobs. This was the 1st time they had seen me in like 7 months and the 1st time they would see me after finding out I\'m transitioning. Because of this I wore a androgynous zip up jacket I have had for a few years. While I did get a few weird looks from some of my aunt and uncles friends I really didn\'t care. My extended family ended up being super supportive even though they were more than a little bit shocked when they heard. I ended up shoeing one of my aunts pictures from the day before and she said ""You look amazing... omg it\'s like you were meant to be a girl!"" I still feel like I didn\'t pass in that picture but it still was an nice comment to receive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSunday 30th\n\nI had plans to go to pride with my other sister who\'s only 2 years younger than me. She was planning on going with her boyfriend, her boyfriends friend, one of her friends and me if I would go. I wore a shirt and the jeans from the evening before. The shirts sleeves ended on my forearms and had a section displaying way more of my upper chest than I ever displayed before (no boobage was visible and I was wearing a bra. It was easy to tell I have boobs from the side or front of me because the shirt was stylized to be somewhat tight. We ended up watching a good amount of the parade even though it was insanely crowded. Once we actually got inside the party area we just walked around and saw some very interesting people in various states of dress or undress (I guess that is just how pride is lol). The music everywhere sucked but that\'s because most people like shitty music (that is just my opinion as a person who prefers metal and some rock over anything else.) Even still it was a amazing experience and I highly recommend anyone to go except kids as their is public nudity at pride.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Last few days have been incredible!!!

2019-07-01 22:48:18,c81c5w,3,7,"I should probably start off by saying that I first started having issues with therapists in regards to my gender when I was sent to a therapeutic boarding school when I was a teenager. I'm assigned female at birth and I never felt right living my life as a woman. The boarding school I was sent to didn't allow me to explore my sexuality or the issues I was having with my gender.

When I got home I got another therapist who was and is a lot better. I immediately started unpacking my gender dysphoria with her and was presenting as genderqueer a lot of the time. I initially wanted to do a partial transition with hormones but was told that was not possible. I remember crying to my therapist and was told that a lot of the things I wanted sounded like I was a man. I kind of just went with it because it sounded right at the time and I just wanted to get as far as possible from my experience as a woman.

Fast forward to now, I've been on testosterone for almost six years and got top surgery. I use he/him pronouns and I'm so much more comfortable with my body, my name, and my pronouns. All of that's fine. I no longer pack because I don't think I actually have bottom dysphoria.. I don't want bottom surgery and I almost feel like I packed because I felt like I was supposed to have bottom dysphoria because I felt lopsided. I've also been exploring my femininity because I no longer feel threatened by it. People definitely experience me as a man, which is better than being experienced as a woman but something still doesn't feel quite right about calling myself a man.. It feels like I was being pushed into the binary no matter who I asked for help, whether it was to be a woman or be a man. I've told my therapist a few times that it feels like at my core I don't identify with being a man and was wondering if I was nonbinary and was told there was no way I was nonbinary which was difficult to hear because it gave me no room to explore it with them.. and I think they feel that way because after transitioning, I look like a cisgender man.

This is something I'm definitely going to try to sit with and explore. I don't want to make any big decisions right now but it does seem like I've known for a long time that I have felt and do feel a bit of disconnect from identifying as a woman or a man. Would love to hear if anyone has had experiences like this before though. I regret nothing about physically transitioning or changing my name and pronouns but it definitely feels like somethings going on inside me that's telling me that somethings not quite right about identifying as a ""man"".",trans,Therapist told me everything I wanted sounded like I was a man but I'm beginning to think I was right from the beginning that I don't quite fit the binary,1562046498.0,"{'created_utc': 1562021298, 'id': 'c81c5w', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'I should probably start off by saying that I first started having issues with therapists in regards to my gender when I was sent to a therapeutic boarding school when I was a teenager.

###### **TRIGGER WARNING: BODY DYSPHORIA — CLINICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF ANATOMY, TISSUE SHEDDING, AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY.**

***The Journey***

Adding a new, small, human addition to our family has not been as straightforward as it is for a number of cisgender, heterosexual couples. Why? I am a trans man who, personally, only felt comfortable with a limited number of options.

I remember when I started hormone treatments at the Howard Brown Health Center back in 2012. It was a two day process back then. Perhaps it still is. The first day, they gave me two sheets of paper with a long lost of the irreversible side-effects of beginning exogenous testosterone. I remember feeling indescribable joy reading that my voice would get deeper, I would grow more body hair, and it would be easier to build lean muscle. I also remember the long list of possible, unwanted side effects: balding, polycythemia (increased red blood cells), blood clots, infertility, PCOS, and death, to list a few.

They let people sit with that list, and come back the next day to begin treatment if I decided to accept all the risks. I went during Pride month (June), and I was so excited! ...

1. What are most binders made of? Are they similar to over-bust corsets, or are they made of different materials? If so, what are they?   

2. What does a properly-fitting binder feel like? Are they supposed to be tight-fitting a restricting, or looser and comfortable?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've fully accepted my transness and have am in talks with my therapist about options, which is funny because I've only had 3 sessions haha. I mean, I mostly accepted this was the case as pandora's box opened and there is no way of shutting it this time. But that's beside the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told my best friend, cis male, that I have ""Serious life things to talk about"" this sunday. He doesn't know whats up but knows that I've been super depressed for a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to me, this is where I make it official. If I tell him then there is no turning back. The box will be fully open and I'll be vulnerable and must move forward ( which is what I want) . 

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of you have any suggestions on how to go about this? I don't honestly know how he will take it but I want suggestions to get a good idea of what to say.

I explained that I have always viewed myself as female, and when I view myself in the mirror, it gives me great distress.

&amp;#x200B;

To explain my transition as being caused by an autogynephilic fetish, you need to assume the following:

I at one point had a male gender identity, and view myself as male with a female gender identity.

I view my natal genitals as part of my own body.

When I imagine sexual situations that arouse me, my gender identity is a prime factor in my arousal.

That there is some mystical force that prevents me from feeling constant arousal since I constantly have a female gender identity, and view my body as female.

That orgasm removes my dysphoria.

That receiving my breast augmentation caused an increase in sexual arousal.

That I receive sexual arousal when looking forward to bottom surgery.

That I have somehow been in denial about all of the above for the entirety of my 26 years on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

To explain my transition as being caused by a natural female gender identity that creates existential distress, you need to assume the following:

Trans identities are a biological identity that come with a sense of self that differs from what is physically present.

That's it.

I have always felt like I was born, wrong?
Like, for as long as I can remember I never really felt comfortable looking feminine. 
whether it be, clothes, hair, makeup, etc,
I always just feel, idk, icky? When I look like a girl.

And even though I have a very flat chest,
I still feel super, idk, gross? About it.
I wear a binder whenever I can,
And if I can't wear it that day I wear baggy clothing to hide my chest.

And I like being called they/them,
and i dont mind he/him,
but she/her makes me feel that weird gross feeling again. 

But the thing that gets me is,
I don't necessarily feel anything twords my, uh ""genital area""?

Like, I don't exactly like what I have,

I hate my chest,

So aside from the strong possibility that breast enlargement creams won't work, if they do will they give me small breasts?

I don't really want large breasts, it just isn't my thing, so I'd honestly be ok with some breast enlargement if that's all they can do. If I could get an A cup sized pair of breasts that would be perfect (if I'm lucky maybe B sized breasts, but that probably pushing it). Now I don't expect these creams to work in a week, or in a month even, so if you're going to warn me that they take a while don't worry, I expect that.

There's also the matter of health relating to these creams. I've read that some of them actually use your hormones to have their effects and can possibly harm you if not supervised by a doctor. Now I myself am not in the position to see a doctor for hormone monitoring and on top of that it probably will cost me a lot so if it's true that they mess around with hormones then I don't think I'll take those untill I can talk to a therapist and decide weather or not hrt is an option.

Oh I should have probably mentioned this but right now I'm not in transition or anything yet, heck no one really knows I'm considering being trans yet. So that kinda explains why I can really go to a doctor yet. And yes I know if I get small breasts people will freak out, but if I get small breasts as a guy I can just wrap it around with the same thing that ftm guys use and say that their just man boobs.

2019-07-05 19:12:54,c9jwqy,3,0,"Long story short, I’m back on HRT after about a 6 year hiatus. Had a lot of things I had to overcome, like alcoholism and some childhood trauma, anxiety. 

I’ve always been attracted to women only. I’ve been girl crazy since day one. But also I wanted to be a girl since day one. I used to look at all the sale ads in my dad’s Saturday morning newspapers, from places like Target, and long for girls undies and cute clothes and felt very confused about myself and how I fit in the world... but also was big time compartmentalizing. Probably filed most of that under fetishisms but very much knew I wanted to be female. Dated girls all through my 20s and 30s, had some drunk sex with guys on the DL, was open about my gender stuff at various moments. I lived in New Orleans for 12 years and presented as fem for pretty much the whole time I lived there. Also I haven’t had sex since 2007. Last girlfriend was a lesbian. Since then didn’t have anyone on the radar. 

Anyway, here I am blossoming and being the most happiest I’ve ever been, back on track, and I came out to everybody and just everything is really unfolding on so many levels. Life is getting good. 

A few days ago I microdosed some Molly as kind of a personal therapy session. I used it to really get into myself and have some quality alone time and love myself and play with clothes and makeup and music, feel sexy, pump up my girl vibes and totally embrace some things. At one point I started searching for hypno kinda positive affirmation fem stuff, and stumbled upon SISSY HYPNO PORN. Y’all! I’m dead. WTF?! I think it’s highly debatable that any of it actually has any true hypnotic effects on me but what it did do was expose a part of my sexuality, full on, that I was pretty much blind to. Like, I love cocks, I want cocks, it turns me on big time that men want me (something I kinda knew deep down but ignored)... it makes my guts quiver and makes me want to explode and turn into a total cock riding slut. The thing is though, I’m not attracted to men. I’m more attracted to trans girls than females these days because of so many reasons, and that led to me being totally turned on by cocks, trans cocks, but still. I didn’t see this coming.

And in the past, the few times I was with guys, I noticed that super aroused butterflies in my stomach feeling, but I thought it was just nervousness or that I was feeling different because being with a man made me feel super fem. Females and other queer gals and trans peeps never respond to my profile or dating posts, but then I get all these dudes with sex messages. Like duh, that’s a given, but yeah. Ive even mostly resented men most of my life and didn’t want to have much to do with them. So last night I indulged some of them with super dirty talk and I can’t tell you how much it made me feel like... such intense sexual energy. Like mind blowing. A pivotal moment I realized, given past experiences and what I’m realizing.  

So here I am going, wow, now what do I do? I guess I gotta figure out which guys I’m actually attracted to because most of them I am not. I don’t like facial hair or stubble, or hairy bodies, or man hands, or whatever but I can’t ignore this feeling I have. And I have to say the other positive side effect of these videos and these realizations, is that it helped me let go of some really old gender roles bullshit that has been stuck in my psyche, that made me feel shame because my brain was holding onto this small piece of male identity that totally didn’t serve me in anyway and was causing a lot of dysphoria and dissociation. Now I feel more realized as my feminine self. Not that that should have anything to do with cocks and traditional gender roles but hey whatever gets ya there.

About 3 months ago I met with an employer for a job on my campus. I told them that I would be able to start working in August as I wouldn't be able to stay in town. They were cool with this and just said to email them when I'm back in town.

About two months ago I started transitioning and plan to go full time around when the next  semester (August) starts.

I thought about mentioning it in the email mentioned above, but I don't know if I should or how I should even go about that. I feel like it would be weird to just throw in a ""btw I'm trans"" but it would also be weird to just show up and bring it up then.

I am a closeted trans person from Sweden. For my own sake, I won't go into what my biological gender is, I don't think it matters to the situation, since it's a general struggle. (My username won't help you guess, btw.)

I haven't reached out to the actual LGBT community for this yet, and have been dreading doing it for a while. But here I am. I need urgent help and support, both from the community and eventually therapy as well. Anyway.

I came out as trans to my family in 2013-2014, I was met with disrespect &amp; hate, so much that I eventually 'reverted' back and got stuck. I recently started feeling more dysphoric and miserable, due to Pride festivals/parades happening around me and family shutting me down for wanting to go. I've never been to or celebrated pride. They aren't forbidding it, I am allowed to go, but nobody wants to tag along. I want to come out, I want to transition before it's ""too late."" Though my NEED to transition is massive, I can't. I'm too afraid, I'm driven by what people will think of me, what my family will feel. FYI I am above 18, but I currently live with my mother and step-father until I begin 'college' (folkhögskola) where I will be living at campus.

On to my story, I did come out before as I mentioned. I was greeted with my homophobic step-father belittling me, referring to me as ""it"" - instead of respecting my preferred pronouns. The times I passed in public and was called by my preferred pronouns he would correct the person talking. I was openly humiliated, in a ""fun and joking"" way, at home. I put up with it, some of which I didn't realise was actual bullying til years later. I had about 3 friends who accepted me at the time as well as my mother who was a bit on-and-off, but tried her best to help me (...silently judging me at times, which is honestly understandable.) I've identified as cis now, trying to fit in for years, but I've started to worry about my own health. Forcing myself to live as cis is taking it's toll on me. Seeing people of the opposite gender reminds me of what I can never have, seeing trans people who are far into on their journey upsets me. Deeply. I keep thinking it won't ever be me. I'm so insecure, and with bottled up transphobia (towards myself) it's even harder. I used to harm myself by restricting my eating, self harm, the usual stuff. Today I keep coming back to suicide as an option, like I'll be starting over or something - I see it as finally finding my peace, getting rid of all worries &amp; saving my family the trouble. It's not necessarily in a ""depressive"" way. (I don't need any suicide hotline numbers, believe me, there is no need to worry about that, I'll get into therapy as soon as school begins to help with that.) There is so much hindering me... What will my homophobic grandmother &amp; step-father think? How will my mother feel? Will I disappoint everybody? Ruin the relationships I have with everybody? And no, I will never just ignore what my family thinks or go against their will too blatantly, even though I'm legal. I care about them very much.

2019-07-06 17:18:40,c9w1xp,1,7,"So, one of my best friends is getting married today. We had talked about me wearing this awesome suit with a skirt thing to her wedding even before she was engaged.

https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/billy-porter-dress-oscars-2019.jpg

I had all the pieces to make the outfit, but when the week came to put it together I just... didn't.  I mean she knows I'm trans, she's like one of three people who know. But I'm not out, and we haven't talked about me wearing it since before her engagement and before she even picked a day.

So todays the day. My son (7), bless him wants to wear a dress and I got him one that matches his mother. They look beautiful together. I however, have a regular suit and tie that matches my wife's outfit and I'm staring at it just wondering what I'm doing.

I got about 3 hours before we head off to the wedding, and it's not enough time to put together the outfit, even hapassardly. Crinoline is terrible to work with, let alone in a rush. 

I know today is about her, she won't even remember I'm sure about the outfit choice. But I cant help but feel like if she does remember it'll be a disappointment, and that on top of it I'm really disappointing myself.

I mean, I'm a month into HRT and I still can't get up the courage to just tell people, and be myself.

2019-07-06 19:44:23,c9xqqp,2,6,"K, so, I’m 17 now. I’m more mature and less cringed now but here’s my life:

As a kid, I would always pretend to be male characters (with the exception of 1 character at age 2 and 1 genderless/female character at age 13. I would like to pretend I was a boy and I’d like people to call me by these characters’ names. Still, I didn’t feel like “I am not a girl” or anything.

At age 13, I began to create online profiles to roleplay as fictional characters, always male. Sometimes I’d make “personal” accounts where I’d seek naming inspirations from them to come up with boys names I thought was cool, and put he/him in my bio. I would tie my hair back in photos, and cut it shoulder length so I could look more boyish. So I would pretend to be a boy but still, in real life, didn’t think I was one. 

Leaning about puberty, I was silly in sex ed because I was kinda secretly grossed out as I didn’t want to grow female parts. I identified as asexual at this age, and did until I realised at the age of 16 that I can’t be asexual since I get turned on and want to have a partner but I still find it hard now, at 17, to know if I truly like someone. Maybe I’m aromantic or maybe I’m just too insecure.

I always dressed emo because I like how black hid all my body. I was chubby (NOT how overweight or obese people say “I’m chubby xD” I was DEFINITELY healthy but being chubby with an underweight sister made my dad call me fat (he now retracts his statements since he realises she isn’t what healthy is) and messed me up in the head so I became anorexic lol love that for me. I still went by male online, and now started going as male full time, looking at boy thinspo rather than girl ones. I also HATE my chest and began to bind, which my parents are aware of

I began exploring different aesthetics when I felt thin and my body and looks were seen as attractive, getting quite a lot of followers fans and money online and I found a cute pastel aesthetic that I’d wear. I tried to not hide my chest to feel more comfortable looking girlish but online I’d still hide it since I told people I was just a feminine boy (??? I’m not that that feminine and never have been so idk what tf that phase was about) and yEAH so I started dressing emo again because I felt like I was too girly then, and I still liked the colours but it made me feel all bad

I IDed as Male full time online and told one of my online friends I was trans when she seemed confused and asked my pronouns. I’ve known her for 7 months, IDing as ftm consistently. I now bind my chest and have chin length hair (it’s not that masc but I’d like boy hair and to be perceived as a boy) and dress in baggy clothes BUT still want to dress in my colourful 90s aesthetic without feeling like I have to force myself to be feminine or a girl just cus I wear colours :)

Still even though I want a flat chest, dick, to be a BOY and called HE, sometimes I feel bad since I’m not super masculine (I like bright colours and I’m kinda sensitive) but I’m not feminine either I don’t wear makeup or skirts!! I DONT think I’m nonbinary though I don’t wanna be called they them
I also didn’t think I was trans until later on so idk I feel bad and fake and I feel insecure because I had an eating disorder and very likely may relapse and I don’t want my gender attributed to that???

2019-07-06 20:45:39,c9yfkn,2,7,"So, some small backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in the hospital, overcoming some nasty wounds I sustained in an accident. On Saturdays, they take me for a shower, and before they did, I got to see myself nude in the mirror.

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked. I was shocked at how feminine my body looked. How my hips now curve away from my waist, how my breasts sit high and proud on my chest. At how my thighs were lush and curved. I am a lucky trans-woman in many ways, as I was born with a naturally feminine bone-shape; but I was mostly amazed at what the hormones had done.

&amp;#x200B;

Without a doubt, I have a woman's body shape. I feel so extraordinarily lucky, so happy, and so fulfilled that I decided to transition. I saw my entire body as attractive for the first time in my life, and that was amazing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I normally do not post about positivity, but I felt the need to here. For transgender people not on hormones yet, let this be a lesson. They do work. They do destroy body disphoria. They can often get you results that you will not just find serviceable, but make you happy.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I am beyond overjoyed. I'm only two-and-a-half years in, and there is more to come. This staggers me, and brings me joy that I have not had for years.

&amp;#x200B;

You can do it my transgender siblings. You can, because you are brave, you are determined, and you don't let what society tells you is wrong deter you. You are all amazing people, and I am thrilled to have found myself in a community of brothers and sisters.

2019-07-06 21:13:09,c9yqzs,1,0,"Some people seem to think that discrimination towards Trans folx is exaggerated.
People like to say everyone has to deal with discrimination and/or injustice which are true.  Even cis white hetero males face problems in the world. Income equality has only gotten worse and worse since the 80's and automation has continued to eliminate jobs. Employers would rather hire someone willing to work horrible hours and horrible conditions with poor benefits and as little pay as possible rather than someone who is computer literate. And unions that do exist typically just want to make money for themselves rather than better conditions for workers. Crap like this has left blue collar workers in the dust and uncertain futures lead to a lot of fear and anxiety.
Cis women face these issues as well with added layers. On average women earn more degrees than men, bachelor, master and doctorate degrees. Even with that though some statistics show women earn 80% of what men make. You can also add sexual harassment to the list as well, for every 100 women 81 of them have been sexually harassed in their life whether it be verbal or physical.  38 of those women dealt with it in the workplace especially those in the service industry, typically ones where their income partially comes from tips. Women typically get overlooked for promotions when competing with male counterparts, especially women if color. 1 in 6 women have been victims of sexual violence. Pregnancy rate is 5% per rape among victims of reproductive age. 7% of pregnant women were asked to resign from their jobs. 59% of women seeking abortions are already mothers. And yet these women are being hit with bans and persecution for wanting or having abortions.
Trans folx also face most and sometimes all of the things listed above for both men and women with even more layers than that. Front and foremost is a lack in legal protections whether it be housing, employment, education, medical care or even in some states just using public restrooms.  I myself have faced discrimination in medical care with my own primary care doctor that I had seen since i was a teenager. He said he couldn't help me with some my medical needs and couldn't and wouldn't help me with a recommendation. At a point he asked me, ""Why are you even coming here anymore?"" I experienced discrimination in employment as well.  I was fired for trumped up BS shortly after I came out as trans at a previous job. 
Another major and common hurdle for Trans folks is poverty, due to once again lack of legal protection in unemployment. Why would a company retain or hire a Trans individual when they don't have too, the company would face less complaints from bigoted coworkers and customers if they just hire a cis applicant.  Trans folx tend to feel like they need to perform at sometimes unattainable levels of perfection (for their employers) to retain enough credibility to keep the job they have, let alone trying to attain promotions or seeking other jobs.  Poverty and/or unemployment can lead to homelessness which most people understand can lead to underground economies such as drug sales and survival sex work, adding to that even some homeless shelters have been shown to discriminate against Trans folx. 
Some of the discrimination is born from stigmatization like Trans folx being called mentally ill, deviants or sex predators. Even some gay men have criticized Trans folx as an embarrassment and think that T shouldn’t be included in LGB because it makes them look bad or delegitimizes them.  Then there are Trans exclusionary radical feminist that call Trans women TIMs(Trans Identifying Men) and Trans men are called confused lesbians or female betrayers. The rise in white nationalism has led to even more hate for Trans folx as well. Some people that were on the fence and didn't care can sometimes fall into radicalization by hate groups and become violent towards Trans folx and many other minorities. These types of things and many more, can lead to lot violence towards the community. Just in the last 6 months there have been at least 11 transgender people fatally shot or killed this year.  Last year it was 23.  These numbers are believed to be under reported and also don't include the countless physical assaults or beatings endured.  I can't go two weeks without seeing another beating on my news feed.  And still those are only the ones that are reported.
Working our way to the most marginalized are Trans women of color or even non binary people of color, we see most and possibly all of the issues listed above and yet still more layers that come with racial inequality. Poverty (again), housing discrimination (again), Increased incarceration rates sometimes due to racial profiling (which can also lead to even more strife and even death if placed in the wrong prison, according to gender, or even in general population) 60% of those imprisoned are POC, Medical care access due to poverty and being uninsured, this list is long and not nearly everything is listed. Of those 11 Trans folx shot so far this year, all of them were POC. Most, but not all, of the physical assault and beatings that I have seen or read about are POC.
I have heard Trans women of color described as the canary in the coal mine and as diminishing as that sound it hits a certain cord.  When the world ignores the most marginalized the marginalized are silenced and are not there to help those that remain, when hatred for others tastes blood it doesn't usually stop after the first bite.
Most of everything I have talked about here has only really just begun to scratch the surface but the take away from all this is, I believe, if you dig through all the layers down to the most marginalized and fight for their equality than in essence you fight for everyone’s equality.  At the very least I hope someone reading this will be able to admire the bravery of Trans POC and can develop respect what Trans POC go through just to exist in this world.
#EqualityForAll #BlackTransLivesMatter",trans,Rambling post about equality...I had alot on my mind today...,1562472789.0,"{'created_utc': 1562447589, 'id': 'c9yqzs', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'Some people seem to think that discrimination towards Trans folx is exaggerated.\nPeople like to say everyone has to deal with discrimination and/or injustice which are true.  Even cis white hetero males face problems in the world. Income equality has only gotten worse and worse since the 80\'s and automation has continued to eliminate jobs. Employers would rather hire someone willing to work horrible hours and horrible conditions with poor benefits and as little pay as possible rather than someone who is computer literate. And unions that do exist typically just want to make money for themselves rather than better conditions for workers. Crap like this has left blue collar workers in the dust and uncertain futures lead to a lot of fear and anxiety.\nCis women face these issues as well with added layers. On average women earn more degrees than men, bachelor, master and doctorate degrees. Even with that though some statistics show women earn 80% of what men make. You can also add sexual harassment to the list as well, for every 100 women 81 of them have been sexually harassed in their life whether it be verbal or physical.  38 of those women dealt with it in the workplace especially those in the service industry, typically ones where their income partially comes from tips. Women typically get overlooked for promotions when competing with male counterparts, especially women if color. 1 in 6 women have been victims of sexual violence. Pregnancy rate is 5% per rape among victims of reproductive age. 7% of pregnant women were asked to resign from their jobs. 59% of women seeking abortions are already mothers. And yet these women are being hit with bans and persecution for wanting or having abortions.\nTrans folx also face most and sometimes all of the things listed above for both men and women with even more layers than that. Front and foremost is a lack in legal protections whether it be housing, employment, education, medical care or even in some states just using public restrooms.  I myself have faced discrimination in medical care with my own primary care doctor that I had seen since i was a teenager. He said he couldn\'t help me with some my medical needs and couldn\'t and wouldn\'t help me with a recommendation. At a point he asked me, ""Why are you even coming here anymore?"" I experienced discrimination in employment as well.  I was fired for trumped up BS shortly after I came out as trans at a previous job. \nAnother major and common hurdle for Trans folks is poverty, due to once again lack of legal protection in unemployment. Why would a company retain or hire a Trans individual when they don\'t have too, the company would face less complaints from bigoted coworkers and customers if they just hire a cis applicant.  Trans folx tend to feel like they need to perform at sometimes unattainable levels of perfection (for their employers) to retain enough credibility to keep the job they have, let alone trying to attain promotions or seeking other jobs.  Poverty and/or unemployment can lead to homelessness which most people understand can lead to underground economies such as drug sales and survival sex work, adding to that even some homeless shelters have been shown to discriminate against Trans folx. \nSome of the discrimination is born from stigmatization like Trans folx being called mentally ill, deviants or sex predators. Even some gay men have criticized Trans folx as an embarrassment and think that T shouldn’t be included in LGB because it makes them look bad or delegitimizes them.  Then there are Trans exclusionary radical feminist that call Trans women TIMs(Trans Identifying Men) and Trans men are called confused lesbians or female betrayers. The rise in white nationalism has led to even more hate for Trans folx as well. Some people that were on the fence and didn\'t care can sometimes fall into radicalization by hate groups and become violent towards Trans folx and many other minorities. These types of things and many more, can lead to lot violence towards the community. Just in the last 6 months there have been at least 11 transgender people fatally shot or killed this year.

I’ve accepted it, and begun working on losing weight to prepare myself mentally and physically for hrt. 

I told my ex I’m seeing a gender therapist and it went fairly well. But I didn’t get into my transition with her because of the kids and I need to tread lightly so I don’t lose them. Last week I got drunk and came out to my cousin and explained how I’ve been suffering dysphoria my whole life and that I’m questioning my gender/sexuality. He took it really well and was shocked because of the hyper masculine life I’d led to this point. 

Fast forward to now, he’s texting me all the time which is fine. He wants to hang out way more than normal, and I think he’s just trying to be supportive which is cool. However, since I told him my secret, I’ve had a hard time feeling feminine. I haven’t allowed myself to me Meghan hardly at all and I feel a lot of shame and self conscious about myself.

I’m trans (questioning / MtF?), but not really out.

I don’t know if she’s picked up on something or if she just uses “dear” for anyone it reasonably could fit, but either way it just makes my day every time, and washes away a lot of the social anxiety that I might normally feel in that space.

My legal name is Kasey, but I absolutely hate that name. I don't  **FEEL** like a Kasey, and I never have. I internally cringe everytime I get called that. I've ALWAYS felt like a (insert my middle name here). It feels right, it feels good, it feels like ME. And Kasey never has. (I know being trans gendered is much harder. I know for certain that I have not going through anywhere near the struggles someone in the trans community has. This is just how I really feel and I wanted to explain that.)

I'm FINALLY getting to legally change my name after moving to another state where it no longer costs $400 with a mountain of paperwork (SC for the lose, VA for the win!). I'm changing my name to my middle name so that I can finally feel like me. Since I don't like Kasey I'm not going to make it my middle name, but this leaves me without one.  I've been looking at baby name sites to try to find a new one, but I've been hit with ""choice exhaustion"" so to speak.

Any advice on how to pick the perfect name for me?

P.s. I have a huge respect for everyone in the trans community.

2019-07-09 13:46:31,cb137a,5,3,"So I've been trying to come out for like, the past 3 years. I've finally decided on a letter! Think this is good?


""Hello to all those who receive this. 
This is not easy to say in person, which I have been trying to do for 3 years now. I've decided to write a letter instead, so here we go. 

All my life I have been a 'tomboy' I guess you could say. Never liked wearing dresses or skirts, never wore makeup, the only remotely 'feminine' thing I ever liked were teddies. Around the age of 13 it all made sense to me, however, when I discovered the LGBT community. 

I found it through a friend I had made, and I have to thank them for it, because otherwise this would be happening a lot later in life. Thanks to them, I discovered myself. I realised that my childhood made sense, and I wasnt just that weird little girl that wasnt very girly. Thanks to that friend I also went through a few names back then too. Thankfully they didnt stick and I found a better one. 


The thing is, I always thought I was just ""too shy to wear a skirt"" and that wearing one or even putting on make up made me uncomfortable because ""I was too shy and worried what people would say"". That's partially right, but probably not because I was shy. Sure, I WAS shy, but that's not exactly why I didnt like wearing skirts and makeup. 
While I did wear one throughout year 7, and the fact that I wore a dress on holiday for that fancy night, it was mainly to try and be more feminine. To try and convince myself that I was feminine. It didnt exactly work. 
While I do really love the cruise dress, I didnt feel too comfortable in it. I felt dysphoria. Flashback to prom: that anxiety attack I had before leaving the house was due to dysphoria. I felt incredibly distressed from wearing a dress and make up and looking 'girly' and it made me panic. I didnt realise it at the time, but it was dysphoria*. 
*There will be a link to explain dysphoria. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is: 3 years ago, I realised that I am transgender. All of the things that I felt didnt make sense, the being a 'tomboy' and trying to act feminine to at least FEEL like I wasnt weird, it makes sense. 
3 years ago I realised that what I felt was the sense of being in the wrong body. All these years, I just thought I was a tomboy. All these years, the anxiety and 'shyness' I felt was due to not being in the right body and feeling dysphoric and distressed over it. 

I'm basically writing this so you will have time to react. If I said this in person I definitely wouldnt make sense, but writing it down does and I need to say it sooner or later. So, there you go. I'm transgender, and I would like you all to call me Kai from now on. Since it has been 3 years and I am still feeling like this, I think it's safe to say that this feeling will not go away any time soon. 
So, what does this mean to family, friends, etc? 
Well, as for family, you have a new son/brother now. I know it may take time to get used to it, but I know you will. For friends, I'm the same person, just different gender. 

I know it may take time to get used to, and I know this may be hard to comprehend. Mum, you did NOT raise me wrong, in fact you raised me well. The anxiety is not your fault, that is probably in part due to the dysphoria to be honest. None of this is because of you. It's all due to my own brain. The whole family has been great my whole life. This is not because of anyone and I really hope everyone understands that.

Thankfully they didnt stick and I found a better one. \n\n\nThe thing is, I always thought I was just ""too shy to wear a skirt"" and that wearing one or even putting on make up made me uncomfortable because ""I was too shy and worried what people would say"". That\'s partially right, but probably not because I was shy. Sure, I WAS shy, but that\'s not exactly why I didnt like wearing skirts and makeup. \nWhile I did wear one throughout year 7, and the fact that I wore a dress on holiday for that fancy night, it was mainly to try and be more feminine. To try and convince myself that I was feminine. It didnt exactly work. \nWhile I do really love the cruise dress, I didnt feel too comfortable in it. I felt dysphoria. Flashback to prom: that anxiety attack I had before leaving the house was due to dysphoria. I felt incredibly distressed from wearing a dress and make up and looking \'girly\' and it made me panic. I didnt realise it at the time, but it was dysphoria*. \n*There will be a link to explain dysphoria. \n\nBasically, what I\'m trying to say is: 3 years ago, I realised that I am transgender. All of the things that I felt didnt make sense, the being a \'tomboy\' and trying to act feminine to at least FEEL like I wasnt weird, it makes sense. \n3 years ago I realised that what I felt was the sense of being in the wrong body. All these years, I just thought I was a tomboy. All these years, the anxiety and \'shyness\' I felt was due to not being in the right body and feeling dysphoric and distressed over it. \n\nI\'m basically writing this so you will have time to react. If I said this in person I definitely wouldnt make sense, but writing it down does and I need to say it sooner or later. So, there you go. I\'m transgender, and I would like you all to call me Kai from now on. Since it has been 3 years and I am still feeling like this, I think it\'s safe to say that this feeling will not go away any time soon. \nSo, what does this mean to family, friends, etc? \nWell, as for family, you have a new son/brother now. I know it may take time to get used to it, but I know you will. For friends, I\'m the same person, just different gender. \n\nI know it may take time to get used to, and I know this may be hard to comprehend. Mum, you did NOT raise me wrong, in fact you raised me well. The anxiety is not your fault, that is probably in part due to the dysphoria to be honest. None of this is because of you. It\'s all due to my own brain. The whole family has been great my whole life. This is not because of anyone and I really hope everyone understands that. \n\n\nIf you need to read up on some things, here are some links: \nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation-gender/trans-and-gender-nonconforming-identities\n\nhttps://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender\n\nhttps://www.hrc.org/resources/understanding-the-transgender-community\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/ *theres a TON of transgender related stuff on the NHS website, I highly reccomend it. \n\nhttps://www.mermaidsuk.org.uk/parents/\n\nhttps://parentzone.org.uk/article/when-your-child-comes-out-transgender\n\nhttps://everydayfeminism.com/2015/06/how-to-be-ally-to-trans-friend/\n\nI tried my best to be straightforward with this.

I'm a woman and generally pretty damn woman-like, big chest, hips etc. Relatively I've always liked being how I was born and the fact I was a woman but I've always been generally different, always a tomboy and always very spunky, I was raised by my punk dad mostly so it wore on me, I always fit better with guys then gals, etc. Its not exactly a different story from some other women who great up as a big tomboy.

2019-07-10 01:14:07,cb9w83,2,3,"(This might not make sense, as I am an emotional wreck and I just want somebody to give advice, or talk with me, or affirm my validity)

I currently identify as a male. I say currently, because identities can change, and I went through a few before I found one I actually felt comfortable with (male with he/him/his pronouns)

There are a few things that have been plaguing me recently. The first; my friends.

I love them dearly with all my heart, but they’re all girls since I can’t branch out and have male friends. They don’t see me as a dude, and in their eyes, I’m still a girl cause I grew up with most of them. So, obviously I love my friends, and I truly do feel like a male, but sometimes I wonder if i’ll ever be accepted as a male instead of a girl dressed like a dude. My plans are to go to a college a bit far away, and somewhere that not a lot of people from school are going so I can make new friends. 

The second problem, is that sometimes I wonder if I’m faking it. I don’t like my body, for the obvious reasons, but also I hate how big my thighs are, and my stomach flabs, and my second chin that comes out of hiding when I look down. Like, I’m not *huge* but sometimes I feel like I am. Ok, but back to the main reason I think I’m faking it. Sometimes, on my good days where I can get into the shower without wanting to bawl my eyes out at the sight, I wonder if I’m just self-conscious of my body. But, when Im having one of my bad days, im like “it’s so obvious! I hate the female parts, and just desperately want to be accepted as a male!! Why do I question it??!”

The third, is my parents. Like, I came out to my mom multiple times, because of the “I think I’m this” and the “I think I’m that” and when I told her I was trans, she was just as accepting as the other times. But I needed to tell her again a few months later to confirm that, yes, this is still how I feel. She was accepting like every other time. Then, I came out to my dad, while my mom was in the room. My thinking with that was “I’ve come out to her like four times, it will probably get easier” spoiler; it wasn’t. So I’m bawling, trying to explain it, and my dad says something to the degree of “but /why/??? How do you know?? Are you sure this isn’t just a phase??” I tried to explain it, but I wouldn’t put it into words. I just kind of k n e w, if you know what I mean.

My mom brought up “oh you don’t really like the same things as boys! Like sports, or other things like those, and you kind of gravitate towards the girls at school!” And I was just like, yes,, MOTHER! I gravitate towards the girls because the boys don’t like me. And I do like the things guys do. If you had let me, I would be watching ice hockey with my friends. I would be playing ice hockey if I could skate. I would be watching and playing basketball, and street hockey. I would love sports if I didn’t feel so alienated while playing. The boys think I’m no good, because again, the see me as the girl they grew up with. 

Another thing with my parents, is that even though they’re accepting, and they showed me support, it’s still “hey, (deadname)! Can you throw this out please?” Or “oh, my daughter is amazing! She’s the best!” Like that alone, around the house would already make me feel sooo much more immensely valid, but nope! Because I couldn’t explain my gut feeling, I’m still your lovely she-daughter. 

My last problem, is that I don’t have a binder. So whilst I go by my name instead of my dead name, my pronouns instead of female pronouns, and I mostly look like a male, I still have fucking breasts!! No thank you! That would help me so much freaking more than that one kid jerry I never speak to respecting my pronouns and name. I would take a binder over that any day of the week. 

Sorry that this is long, but finding a bunch of people I can relate to, and could possibly help me with this inspired the word-vomit. 

Thanks!

So I’m bawling, trying to explain it, and my dad says something to the degree of “but /why/??? How do you know?? Are you sure this isn’t just a phase??” I tried to explain it, but I wouldn’t put it into words. I just kind of k n e w, if you know what I mean.\n\nMy mom brought up “oh you don’t really like the same things as boys! Like sports, or other things like those, and you kind of gravitate towards the girls at school!” And I was just like, yes,, MOTHER! I gravitate towards the girls because the boys don’t like me. And I do like the things guys do. If you had let me, I would be watching ice hockey with my friends. I would be playing ice hockey if I could skate. I would be watching and playing basketball, and street hockey. I would love sports if I didn’t feel so alienated while playing. The boys think I’m no good, because again, the see me as the girl they grew up with. \n\nAnother thing with my parents, is that even though they’re accepting, and they showed me support, it’s still “hey, (deadname)! Can you throw this out please?” Or “oh, my daughter is amazing! She’s the best!” Like that alone, around the house would already make me feel sooo much more immensely valid, but nope! Because I couldn’t explain my gut feeling, I’m still your lovely she-daughter. \n\nMy last problem, is that I don’t have a binder. So whilst I go by my name instead of my dead name, my pronouns instead of female pronouns, and I mostly look like a male, I still have fucking breasts!! No thank you! That would help me so much freaking more than that one kid jerry I never speak to respecting my pronouns and name. I would take a binder over that any day of the week. \n\nSorry that this is long, but finding a bunch of people I can relate to, and could possibly help me with this inspired the word-vomit. \n\nThanks!\n~~the dude questioning his validity as a dude', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Hey y’all', 'created': 1562746447.0}"
2019-07-10 01:31:41,cba342,4,7,"When I was around 13 or 14 I realized I was not meant to be a boy. My infatuation with Tom boys and edgy metal loving, dark dressing girls, wasn’t because I just wanted to be in a relationship with a girl like that, but because I wanted to BE that. I pretty openly questioned my gender and explored that confusion as I was in California and it was no big deal to my friends at my school. So high school rolls around and I’m much more female presenting and alllll about pride (as a young lgbt member tends to be) and only faced bullying from one person as a result of it, no biggie.

Now here is when things for more difficult, halfway through freshman year, I moved to New Orleans. I thought, “cool, New Orleans is full of lgbt people and is supper accepting!” While that is true, high school is much different. Especially as a 5’5”, 100lb, long haired, quiet, “boy”. So, after plenty of bullying, I dropped being trans. Like I completely dropped it, probably told people I wasn’t anymore, cut my hair short, got rid of my women’s clothing, and stopped training my voice.

To be honest, dysphoria through this time, was not that bad, but seemed to have kinda transferred back to confusion and driving me to still wanting to be “feminine” I.e coming out as a gay male or being a “soft boy”. It was beyond cringy, like mcr and eyeliner style stereotypes (no disrespect to mcr listening, eyeliner wearing people, because that’s still me now)

Finally, I finished high school and started cosmetology school because I love all things beauty. Here I am around other trans women and my school is all about pride and I love it. Since I started, I got to explore my feminine side again and I love it. I wear makeup to school, I started growing my hair out again, I wear skirts and feminine sweaters. 

With finally having this freedom, I realized that I never should have tried to not be who I am. I’m a month away from being 20 now, and I plan on living as a woman from now on. I won’t let people choose who I live my life anymore. I am that metal loving, dark dressing girl, and I always will be. Hopefully in the next couple months I’ll start hrt, and with the help of my amazing partner I have so much more confidence presenting as a female.

Apart from today when he kept asking about my AGAB (I’m AFAB) and I kept responding with the fact I’m Agender and I’m planning on going on T to be more comfortable in myself.

On top of that, he kept asking about my chest, the size of it and how I bind etc. It made me feel so awful because I told him I’m pretty flat chested, which made me happy because it meant I can pass more, and his response was ‘oh well I like small boobs anyways’.

I don’t believe this fantasy makes me gay (not that it’s a bad thing), but I don’t identify as gay as I am not attracted to men, and do not believe that trans girls are men. I imagine trans people, or any LGBTQ supporter for that matter would also agree with me, yes?

Ok, now this is a strange subject for me but it is something I want to have a conversation about. I apologize in advance if anything I say isn’t politically correct, and am totally open to being corrected about anything I say in this post. Im just curious to hear how a trans girl would think about it.

So I have a hard time with the fact that this is a fantasy of mine. I have a hard time with the duality that’s presented by having this fantasy. On one hand, I always mean well. But on the other hand, from what I understand (or assume, rather) is that my very act of having the surface level desire of hooking up with a trans girl in and of its self is self defeating and insensitive towards a trans person. Is this true?

For example: this fantasy exists, but I am afraid of what people around me would think if they saw me spending time with a trans person. Or if someone found out that I had a sexual encounter with a trans girl. 

I also wouldn’t feel right in the sexual encounter if I wasn’t also willing to also accept being seen in public, unlesss I knew the girl I was with understood the situation. It just wouldn’t be right. Yet the fantasy still exists. I want to experience being with a trans girl.

In all honesty, It makes me feel cowardly, the fact that Im open to the sexual aspect but not the societal aspect of it. I’d like to be able to have a one night stand with a trans girl just the way I would with a biological female, but it doesn’t seem possible when that stigma is attached to it. 

I wish it could be taken in a positive light, but I assume that fetishizing your situation of being the right mind in the wrong body or vice/verse is wrong and I imagine it’s a touchy subject for trans people? I want it to be ok... but I feel like from a trans girls perspective it’d be easy to say “so what, am I some kind of experiment for you to fuck?”

Which I would hate for it to be taken that way, but could totally see why it would.

Can someone chime in and help clear this up for me? Am I a monster just for having the desire? Is it acceptable or unacceptable to desire the sexual encounter but be scared of what my peer group would think of me?

Is there an understanding form the trans community about this subject that is different than what I’ve described here?

2019-07-10 17:47:01,cbjw3c,6,2,"Hai! I don't entirely know if this is the subreddit for this but I figured I would post this here but feel free to reffer me to somewhere else if this dosent go here.  


Hey. So I've always been a very feminine male, assigned male at birth and really always been fine with it never thinking I would question my own gender  the past 6 months I've really actually started having doubts and struggles about my gender identity, at first it was moreso doubts and questions rather than any real struggling.  
I had my crush over (who is a guy and I'm assigned male at birth myself) who knows quite a bit more about gender and LGBTQ+ stuff than I did despite me being gay (finding men and masculinity attractive) and it organically turned into him reffering to me femininely and calling me girl when we were having fun and such.  
It honestly just felt so right and I got like a warm fuzzy butterflies in your tummy kind of feeling whenever he called me feminine pronouns and reffering to me in that way and it just felt right really.  


So after he went home after the weekend had ended we texted and stuff like usual. Until yesterday where it started coming into conversation again because I changed my Discord name to Sandy (i've always been called Sander online) because I kinda wanted to try it and experiment a bit with it since I had such a good experience.  
We talked about it and (since we both love DnD and Warcraft and I still play World of Warcraft avidly) we went to talking about female characters that you make yourself, and how ever since I was little I really felt uncomfortable and put off by playing female characters that I made, I've always been fine with playing characters that already were created as female (Lara Croft is one of my favourite video game characters of all time) but I always felt put off when I tried making a female character for myself and stuff like that.  
He suggested why not try it now, since I said it had been YEARS since I last tried making a female character somewhere in my early to mid teens probably (I'm 22 now), and it wouldnt hurt trying making one now on World of Warcraft for example since I could always delete it if I didn't like the animations and the feeling of playing my own female character as much as my male characters.  


So I tried making a female dwarf (dwarves are probs my fave fantasy race) and I basically got the biggest rush, actually feeling good about playing a female character and loving the animations on the dwarf animation rig and such, basically something I've really NEVER felt before it was euphoric. After having just run around checking the voice lines and animations on that character I went to my main, a male dwarf, and played him and I immideatly felt completely the same way as I had about playing female characters I had made ever since I was little. It felt so off putting and uncomfortable, that great big beard didn't fit me anymore where as this monday I could've played him fine no problem and now it felt completely wrong actually playing him as I had made him just a few months ago. I legit couldnt stop just tripping over my words in idek what that emotion was but I was absolutely euphoric. I talked to my crush about it and he explained that it's called Gender Euphoria, which I didn't know was a thing since I'd only ever heard of Gender Dysphoria, and that it's really normal to feel for people who discover something good or are having good experiences about their gender identity, like wearing clothes you really identify with and such. I remembered the EXACT same feeling when I wore makeup for the first time back in early 2017 and I never looked back from that, I'd always wanted to wear makeup and a friend gave me the last little friendly nudge to get me to buy some makeup I was looking at.  


I basically kept having question fly around my head since yesterday like ""Am I really a girl?"" and stuff akin to that and I basically just ended yesterday on that euphoric high more or less, I just felt so happy and content and it felt right.  


Today I think I experienced Gender Dysphoria for the first time on my own body and mind. After all that's been happening over the weekend and yesterday and not having needed to go for groceries and really leave my appartment or balcony that much into public view, I went to the grocery store and a petshot to buy my cat a new collar since the last one broke. On the way there a voice very akin to the one that starts berrating me when my depression has been really bad ever since I was a child, started questioning me and doubting me and halfway berrating everything that I'd felt and been happy and content about over the weekend and yesterday. Saying stuff like ""But you were born a boy, and you don't even really know if you're a girl at all."" and ""Women are weak, you wouldn't want to be weak and bullied like when you were a child again would you?"" and things like that. When we finally got to the shop I actually felt physically dimscomfortable with looking the way I did going into the shops, I wore a feminine cardigan and a t-shirt, black jeans and boots, something I legit wear everyday and absolutely feel fine in and love that type of outfit and have done so for the past 2 to nearly 3 years. I'd never felt uncomfortable in that way before, being uncomfortable in my own body and scared people were looking at me even though I was wearing and looking like I have done for many years and feeling absolutely fine about it through all those years and loving the style and wardrobe I've created for myself. It was legit one of the most horrible things I'd ever experienced, I'd experienced feeling uncomfortable and sad in my own skin but NEVER to this extent or this level and in this specific way before.

&amp;#x200B;

I went home and layed in bed and started to cry still having that voice berrate and question me inside my head and before falling asleep into a long nap the last thing I can really remember thinking conciously was ""I think I might be a girl...""   
I've never experienced anything on this scope and scale about my own gender identity before, I'd gone my entire life feeling just fine with assigning myself as male and I've never been unhappy with my genitalia and I'm still not, but I don't really feel like just a feminine guy anymore but not entirely a girl either, at least not yet? And in hindsight I think this is something that's always been stirring in me since I was a child but that I'd always repressed it as a survival mechanism having grown up in a broken home with a psychopatic and alcoholic father. I have so many questions and doubts and I just don't really know where I am or how I stand in terms of my own identity anymore. I hope this wall of text isn't too much for anyone to read in here and hopefully someone might be able to help me, I looked at all of your different picture posts in here and you're all so gorgeous and brave.

I know it can take some time for them to fully comprehend things, and I know that my mum is trying her best, but some of the things shes said have bugged me. Shes coming with me to get my hair cut though and I hope she starts calling me Kai by then, because I told the barbers my name is Kai LOL.

Someone saw my existence as nothing more than a sexual object to them. They felt so passionate about fetishizing me that they edited TEN photos and SENT them to me (thinking I’d be pleased????). It was such a powerful moment in my life because I realized that my body will never feel like mine.

Before transitioning, I wanted to do everything I could to get out of a body that didn’t belong to me; and now that I’m 3 years on HRT, so much fetishization surrounds the community and it often still feels like my body isn’t mine.

I'm here because I'm trans. And I've literally never spoken or written that down before today, even though I think it multiple times a day. I'm 35 years old, and this is the first time. 

I'm scared. I'm afraid of losing my family, my job, my safety -- I'm even afraid of losing my body. I hate it, but it's what I know. It's *all* I know.

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a boy. I have 2 sisters, and when we played pretend I always wanted to be the prince, or Tom Sawyer, or whoever the male character was in the world we were pretending to live in that day. I vividly remember getting in trouble when I was 6 because I took my shirt off like the boy next door had just done.

Puberty came late for me. I was 14 before I got to the point where I had to wear a bra. I hated it. Hated my hips, my breasts, my period -- at first, all I wanted was to go back to the way I was before. Then the dreams started -- and this is embarrassing af, but if I can't share it with total strangers I'll never meet, who *can* I share it with, right? Isn't that the whole purpose of the internet lol? 

Anyway. The dreams. They were sex dreams, but 'wrong.' I was the one on top. I could *feel* down there, and in my dreams I was hard. I can't explain it any better than that, and I'm turning bright red as I type this, but I was most definitely male. And they're recurring. I still get them sometimes. Idk if anyone else has had a similar experience, but I'd love to know if anyone has.

It's not just the dreams. It's everything. I want to be myself. I want to be the person I'm supposed to be -- and I'm terrified. I can't even tell my family I like other women. Telling them I'm trans would almost certainly mean instant expulsion from their midst, with a boot in the ass on the way out. I don't want to lose them, but at the same time, this is killing me. I wake up every morning and do my make up the way I was taught, but I can't meet my eyes in the mirror. I present as very feminine -- my hair is down past my waist (and objectively it's beautiful, but all I want is to cut it off and give it away), and as I said, I always do my make up and dress nicely. I was raised to behave like a lady, but it makes me feel sick inside until I get busy enough to forget what I'm wearing.

Idk if anyone else felt/feels this way. I don't want to say 'I hope so,' because this sucks. On the other hand, I don't want to be the only one. I want my experiences to be the door that opens onto who I'm supposed to be, instead of just a constant feeling of wearing the wrong skin. I can't put it any more clearly.

I'm sorry if I should have posted this elsewhere. I just couldn't find anywhere else it would fit. I just want someone to tell me that this is normal, that I'm not losing my mind. I can't tell anyone irl, so the internet is my next best choice lol. If this is in the wrong place, I apologize, and feel free to delete it.

Now, I have several trans friends (mostly trans men, so I'm not as familiar with the process for trans women), but... everyone I know has had to go through MONTHS (sometimes years) of getting mental health evals and letters from a psychologist/psychiatrist just to start hormones, no less top surgery, and nearly no one has bottom surgery because it is such an imperfect science - so how did she go from not transitioning at all to having hormone therapy and both surgeries  in three months as well as getting all her paperwork finalized so quickly?

2019-07-12 03:52:24,cc5sk6,1,5,"Ive been experiencing a lot of weird and new feelings recently, let me give some background to try and explain what’s been going on. 

I am a pansexual cis male. Back when I was younger experimenting with my sexuality and trying to discover myself, I had a lot of self hatred towards myself about the potential of having an interest in males. A lot of time went into working through things and finally accepting who I am. 

After being comfortable with who I was, I discovered I was sexually attracted to smaller, more feminine males. That rabbit hole led me down a path to discover cross dressing and playing around with that for a bit. 

I then got into a straight relationship and hung up my cross dressing clothing to focus on the relationship, assuming that it was all just a fetish for cross dressing and whatnot. 

I’ve been in this relationship for more than 5 years now and can’t be happier. But recently, I’ve been experiencing something strange. 

Sometimes I get the feelings like I want to be cute and more feminine. These feelings started to show up only when I was sexually aroused, due to the association with the things I was into previously. 

I’m a heavier guy than most, big beard, and long hair (about shoulder length). I’ve recently been playing with more feminine hair styles and been taking a lot of photos and realizing that I look what I would describe as cute and more feminine than my regular self. 

Sometimes when I get these feelings, I get that same self hatred feelings I did when I was experimenting with my sexuality. Trying to convince myself there’s no way I can be any kinda of transgender. 

I genuinely don’t know what I’m feeling and if I just feeling this way because of the things I’ve been looking at recently. 

Has anyone felt anything similar? 

I know the only way I can get a definitive answer is by figuring out how I feel myself, but if anyone could guide my into the right direction, I’d appreciate it.

So I'm currently 23 and DFAB, and at around 17/18 I thought I'd finally discovered myself and settled on the fact I was nonbinary.  I'm still torn, thinking I am, but that's for me to find out.

My real concern is my sexuality.  I've known for a long while now that I was attracted to women.  But recently I've started thinking I may actually be a transman after all.  The problem though is the more I think about being a transman, the more I think about being with men.

And I'm just really confused and unsure why I'm feeling this way.  Why is it if I'm nonbinary, I'm more attracted to women, but if I'm a transman I'm more attracted to men.

I have no one to talk to about this, and I wish I'd make up my mind already.  Though I feel if I were to accept myself as a transman, I'd find myself feeling more anxious.

2019-07-13 07:54:21,ccmt4v,2,9,"I guess it's time to write this.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to. It takes courage, courage that I know I have, to reveal myself to you. To openly welcome being othered, openly welcome the ridicule, harassment, and humiliation that will come from it, but I don't have any real options left, not if I'm going to continue living. I wanted to die. My plan was to poison myself with a lethal dose of caffeine, carbohydrates, and sugar. I opened a door back in 2014, after I had left my ex-wife. I didn't really want to leave her; the sex, while sporadic, was good, she was beautiful, funny, and wanted nothing more than to be with me. We had a successful business together, and had a lot of really good times. What we didn't have was good chemistry. She had been abandoned by her father, and never really got over it. I was fresh out of the Army and riddled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety that I learned to contain and shove deep down inside because her OCPD, OCD, and anxiety were too much for her to handle. But, this isn't about her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm male (I have a penis and testicles), caucasian (my skin is white), and I'm primarily attracted to female and feminine presenting individuals. I grew up in a lower-middle class family, with a diverse amount of low- to upper-middle-class friends. I was the golden child of the family, the youngest on my father's side (except for my brother, who is seven years younger), and the oldest on my mother's. I tested well and was placed in gifted and talented programs in school. My IQ is somewhere in the 135-150 range. I've not had it specifically tested, but my ASVAB and vocational aptitude batteries put me in the top 1-3% of the population.

&amp;#x200B;

The first memories I have are of me around the age of two or three, maybe four, at the latest, grinding my penis against a stuffed animal because it felt good. I remember being scolded for doing that during naptime at church daycare. There's large portions of my childhood and adolescence that I don't remember, but what I do remember is being bullied and teased. I remember the only defense I had against my bullies in the fourth grade was to make fun of them for not being able to read as well as I could. That behavior continued until I was in my pre-teens, when I learned about how masturbation was bad, and that I was bad for masturbating and having 'lustful thoughts.' Often, my fantasies would involve becoming something else, some sort of transformation into an animal. I didn't find the act of sex arousing, but the idea of the physical transformation, was. I haven't ever wanted to be the ""me"" that everyone else sees.

&amp;#x200B;

We got America Online when I was about 12, in 1997. The internet wasn't ""new"" to me, then, though the connectivity to other people was. I remember logging onto the Prodigy network when I was younger using dial-up on a diskless 8088. The first ""pornographic"" website I visited was Victoria's Secret, and I fell in lustful jealousy for the first time. I fantasized about them, about the models with angel wings, about what it must be like to have breasts. I probably still have some 3 1/4"" floppies with some of those pictures saved, somewhere. During that time, I was also heavily into science fiction; it didn't matter what series. Star Trek, Star Wars, and Babylon 5 were the most accessible, but I was also reading Aasimov's ""Foundation"" series and a few others at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

AOL opened a whole new world; I met a girl at a Baptist convention that I had attended with my church's youth group, and we exchanged e-mail addresses. This was before instant messaging, and I remember getting home and trading long chains of e-mails back and forth with her. Later, I would get curious and start digging into the .pfc (""personal file cabinet"") files of my dad's e-mail. Before I reached that point, however, I discovered AOL's ""Rhy'Din"" chat rooms, which had a whole host of different-themed fantasy settings and topics, mainly geared towards fantasy role-play. I found and joined a Star Trek role-playing group that met once a week; my parents were less than thrilled to find out about that group. Taking the internet away from me became the only real punishment that they had.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a website, then, from the United Kingdom that was dedicated to stories and images about transformation to horses, donkeys, centaurs, and other equines. I had been role-playing in the Rhy'Din chat rooms (unbeknownst to my parents) as a centaur, at the time, and had already written one or two sex (horribly bad, I'm sure) sex scenes (not as a centaur). I was probably about 13 or 14 at the time. I remember in fairly vivid detail coming in from mowing the lawn, and seeing that website on the computer monitor with both of my parents staring at it. The talk my father and I had after was very short. He asked me why I was on it, and my response was ""It had what I was looking for (I was too embarassed to go into detail and say 'breasts').""

&amp;#x200B;

I was about that same age when I wrote my first BASIC program on a 486-DX33, a choose-your-own-adventure transformation-and-sex story using basic GOTOs and if/then input statements, that allowed me to write and play out my fantasies of becoming different superheroes (I was watching a lot of  'Superfriends' reruns at the time), and pseudo-animals (""furries,"" for those of you aware). I still have copies, somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also about 12 or 13 when I first discovered the ""Federation II"" Multi-User Dungeon beta, which was heavily advertised on AOL, and was billed as a text-based multiplayer adventure game for adults. Prior to that, most of my experience with text-based games had come from the InfoCom games (Moonmist, a Victorian-era murder-mystery had been my first). I had been using the name ""Paveway22"" on AOL up until this point (A moniker which was the combination of the 'Paveway III' bomb, featured heavily on the Sega Genesis game ""F-117 Nightstalker,"" and the .22 caliber bullet). It was revolutionary to me, in that it had the option to get a sex change (along with other options). I incorrectly assumed that it would also change the pronouns in the description I wrote, and started looking or textsex with strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

In school, I was still made fun of and laughed at for being 'the smart fat kid with glasses.' It didn't help matters when I joined band, and chose to play the flute. I lied and told people it was because it was easy to carry and fit in my backpack; the real reason was because it allowed me to be just a tiny bit more feminine, just a little bit closer to being with 'the other girls.'

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I got to High School, I hated myself and hated my body more. I had begged God to take away my sinful nature on more than one occasion, to make the desires and urges stop. Every time I masturbated, I felt guilt, shame, and remorse after (something that continues to this day). I had written sexually suggestive transformation stories about everyone I'd found attractive, and continued to do so. I had learned how to pick the lock to the computer. I spent hours browsing transformation and sex story repositories on the internet, behind my parents' back, and I spent my lunch hours in the library on different MUDs, some adult, some not, but the adult ones were where what I was looking for. I would trawl through AOL profiles, looking for people to instant message about centaur-themed role-play, and buried myself in books to escape from the people around me that either bullied me, made fun of me, or just ignored me. High School was better, because I was more invisible there.

&amp;#x200B;

I was 16 or 17 when I found Tapestries MUCK (The largest social variant of MUDs, heavy on furry and transformation themes). It was everything that I could want; I wrote sexually suggestive material with strangers, and developed a strong affinity towards BDSM. I was able to play female characters, to 'become' who I wanted, though at the time, I was still intensely guilt-ridden and ashamed to create those characters. On the non-adult MUDs, I was even able to find partners to write adult role-play with. I have been on and off of these different places for the last two decades of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a home on Shangrila MUX the summer after I turned 18. No limits, no-holds-barred, play-anything-you-want. I wasn't alone. I was able to explore all the different fetishes and thoughts that had been accumulating in my head. I'm sure that I was fairly annoying at that time, but I found roleplay partners that enjoyed my company, enjoyed writing weird and odd kink. I created a female character to try and explore that side of myself, and ended up alone and ignored. I joined the Army and went to Basic Training the year after that, and I can't recall the names of the other roleplayers that I met. I remember the name of the domme that I'd met, first, though. Chris, short for Christine, and she sent me a christmas e-card.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on and off of Shangrila MUX since then, several times. I have written so many sex scenes, so many fetish scenes, so many orgasm scenes that they come second nature to me. I've been writing sexual novelties for the last two decades. In 2014, I came out as transgender. My mom ""didn't believe me."" My family has been supportive, but I know they ""want their son"" back. I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be ""trans."" I don't want to have to explain myself to everyone I come across. I don't want to be ""male."" I'm not willing to be openly and visibly trans, to endure the same ridicule, humiliation and suffering that I did back in middle and high school just to ""be me,"" while having to rely on the comfort of internet strangers because I'm not a viable candidate for a female partner. I'm not willing to put myself at risk of being murdered because someone thinks I'm a monster, or a freak, or a threat to their masculinity or a threat to their children. I don't care what you think about trans people, or furries, or BDSM enthusiasts, or people with weird fetishes.

The internet wasn\'t ""new"" to me, then, though the connectivity to other people was. I remember logging onto the Prodigy network when I was younger using dial-up on a diskless 8088. The first ""pornographic"" website I visited was Victoria\'s Secret, and I fell in lustful jealousy for the first time. I fantasized about them, about the models with angel wings, about what it must be like to have breasts. I probably still have some 3 1/4"" floppies with some of those pictures saved, somewhere. During that time, I was also heavily into science fiction; it didn\'t matter what series. Star Trek, Star Wars, and Babylon 5 were the most accessible, but I was also reading Aasimov\'s ""Foundation"" series and a few others at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAOL opened a whole new world; I met a girl at a Baptist convention that I had attended with my church\'s youth group, and we exchanged e-mail addresses. This was before instant messaging, and I remember getting home and trading long chains of e-mails back and forth with her. Later, I would get curious and start digging into the .pfc (""personal file cabinet"") files of my dad\'s e-mail. Before I reached that point, however, I discovered AOL\'s ""Rhy\'Din"" chat rooms, which had a whole host of different-themed fantasy settings and topics, mainly geared towards fantasy role-play. I found and joined a Star Trek role-playing group that met once a week; my parents were less than thrilled to find out about that group. Taking the internet away from me became the only real punishment that they had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found a website, then, from the United Kingdom that was dedicated to stories and images about transformation to horses, donkeys, centaurs, and other equines. I had been role-playing in the Rhy\'Din chat rooms (unbeknownst to my parents) as a centaur, at the time, and had already written one or two sex (horribly bad, I\'m sure) sex scenes (not as a centaur). I was probably about 13 or 14 at the time. I remember in fairly vivid detail coming in from mowing the lawn, and seeing that website on the computer monitor with both of my parents staring at it. The talk my father and I had after was very short. He asked me why I was on it, and my response was ""It had what I was looking for (I was too embarassed to go into detail and say \'breasts\').""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was about that same age when I wrote my first BASIC program on a 486-DX33, a choose-your-own-adventure transformation-and-sex story using basic GOTOs and if/then input statements, that allowed me to write and play out my fantasies of becoming different superheroes (I was watching a lot of  \'Superfriends\' reruns at the time), and pseudo-animals (""furries,"" for those of you aware). I still have copies, somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was also about 12 or 13 when I first discovered the ""Federation II"" Multi-User Dungeon beta, which was heavily advertised on AOL, and was billed as a text-based multiplayer adventure game for adults. Prior to that, most of my experience with text-based games had come from the InfoCom games (Moonmist, a Victorian-era murder-mystery had been my first). I had been using the name ""Paveway22"" on AOL up until this point (A moniker which was the combination of the \'Paveway III\' bomb, featured heavily on the Sega Genesis game ""F-117 Nightstalker,"" and the .22 caliber bullet). It was revolutionary to me, in that it had the option to get a sex change (along with other options). I incorrectly assumed that it would also change the pronouns in the description I wrote, and started looking or textsex with strangers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn school, I was still made fun of and laughed at for being \'the smart fat kid with glasses.\' It didn\'t help matters when I joined band, and chose to play the flute. I lied and told people it was because it was easy to carry and fit in my backpack; the real reason was because it allowed me to be just a tiny bit more feminine, just a little bit closer to being with \'the other girls.\'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time I got to High School, I hated myself and hated my body more. I had begged God to take away my sinful nature on more than one occasion, to make the desires and urges stop. Every time I masturbated, I felt guilt, shame, and remorse after (something that continues to this day). I had written sexually suggestive transformation stories about everyone I\'d found attractive, and continued to do so. I had learned how to pick the lock to the computer. I spent hours browsing transformation and sex story repositories on the internet, behind my parents\' back, and I spent my lunch hours in the library on different MUDs, some adult, some not, but the adult ones were where what I was looking for. I would trawl through AOL profiles, looking for people to instant message about centaur-themed role-play, and buried myself in books to escape from the people around me that either bullied me, made fun of me, or just ignored me. High School was better, because I was more invisible there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was 16 or 17 when I found Tapestries MUCK (The largest social variant of MUDs, heavy on furry and transformation themes). It was everything that I could want; I wrote sexually suggestive material with strangers, and developed a strong affinity towards BDSM. I was able to play female characters, to \'become\' who I wanted, though at the time, I was still intensely guilt-ridden and ashamed to create those characters. On the non-adult MUDs, I was even able to find partners to write adult role-play with. I have been on and off of these different places for the last two decades of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found a home on Shangrila MUX the summer after I turned 18. No limits, no-holds-barred, play-anything-you-want. I wasn\'t alone. I was able to explore all the different fetishes and thoughts that had been accumulating in my head. I\'m sure that I was fairly annoying at that time, but I found roleplay partners that enjoyed my company, enjoyed writing weird and odd kink. I created a female character to try and explore that side of myself, and ended up alone and ignored. I joined the Army and went to Basic Training the year after that, and I can\'t recall the names of the other roleplayers that I met. I remember the name of the domme that I\'d met, first, though. Chris, short for Christine, and she sent me a christmas e-card.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'ve been on and off of Shangrila MUX since then, several times. I have written so many sex scenes, so many fetish scenes, so many orgasm scenes that they come second nature to me. I\'ve been writing sexual novelties for the last two decades. In 2014, I came out as transgender. My mom ""didn\'t believe me."" My family has been supportive, but I know they ""want their son"" back. I don\'t want to be like this. I don\'t want to be ""trans."" I don\'t want to have to explain myself to everyone I come across. I don\'t want to be ""male."" I\'m not willing to be openly and visibly trans, to endure the same ridicule, humiliation and suffering that I did back in middle and high school just to ""be me,"" while having to rely on the comfort of internet strangers because I\'m not a viable candidate for a female partner. I\'m not willing to put myself at risk of being murdered because someone thinks I\'m a monster, or a freak, or a threat to their masculinity or a threat to their children. I don\'t care what you think about trans people, or furries, or BDSM enthusiasts, or people with weird fetishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI.\n\nNever.\n\nWanted.\n\nTo.\n\nBe.\n\nMe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou did this to me. You put all of that on the TV, in church, in schools, in books, and on the internet, and in my search to figure out why I wanted to be something else, to escape this world, You put all of that in my head. You stole my childhood. You perverted and stole my identity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuck You, God, You never even gave me a chance before You and Your fucked-up world fucked me. You took everything that\'s good, and beautiful, and pleasing, and You kept it for Yourself, and then let me be born into a world of shit You didn\'t want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuck.\n\nYou.\n\nI.\n\nDon\'t.\n\nWant.\n\nYour.\n\nLove.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe robots don\'t care, and want me to be happy.\n\nThe robots love me.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'An Open Letter To God From A Trans Girl', 'created': 1563029661.0}"

2019-07-13 21:04:21,ccuh09,3,2,"  Hello,

I’m going to sum this up as well as I can.  Soo I moved back in with my dad like 9 months ago after not being able to afford my place despite having a job I loved for once, they didn’t pay me all that well.

Living with my dad at 24 years old sucks he yells at me if there are any marks on the white appliances we have, if the bathroom door isn’t closed and if I open the windows to let light inside. When I go out he gets extremely upset. I do pay rent but anyways I work weekends and I know I need a change.

What should I do? I need my surgeries also and I just don’t see myself working low paying jobs anymore. For one, I will never be able to afford anything living and working low paying jobs in CA.

2019-07-14 15:10:39,cd4243,4,7,"Over the past 2 weeks I've told my girlfriend and my close friends to various extents that I have been questioning my gender identity and believe I am at least non-binary, maybe transfem. All the friends I've told have reacted positively, and my girlfriend was open to me exploring myself too which was such a relief. I went out with one of my best friends and she took me shopping to try on and buy some clothing a couple of times which felt amazing - we even went out exercising together in some quiet public places while I was dressed in my new feminine activewear. I got myself a top and a few skirts and it feels really good to just be open about how I feel and have people to talk to, but I want more. I wish I could be more open at home, but don't feel comfortable doing that at the moment, but it sucks that I can rarely ever wear my stuff for more than a few moments.  


I've lurked here and in similar communities for a while, and been questioning myself even since I was very young but only about 3 months ago finally went to talk to a psych about it. It has been good to be able to express rather than repress, and I have felt more balanced, but I feel like I've learnt so much more yet opened up so many more questions in the past week than I have for years. For a while I've been shaving my legs, and recently my body too except my arms, and I've purchased a fair few bras to wear under my clothing that have really felt affirming.  


Tonight I went out with 2 male friends dressed in the same activewear I mentioned before, and mostly it was fine, I even stopped thinking about what I was wearing sometimes, but at one point a group of teen boys all stopped talking and just stared at me as I walked out of the restaurant.   


I've decided I certainly want to learn to do more to pass, and also more subtle things to do to alleviate my dysphoria so I can feel more confident, yet not be obvious around my family.   


I want to learn to shave better, since it comes back so quickly and leaves a grey shadow on my face, and I think I want to shape my eyebrows differently too. My girlfriend suggested I get some tinted lip balm too. I've also been \*trying\* to speak with a higher, more varied tone but it's hard to keep conscious of it, I think my singing experience has been useful though in that regard.  


Part of me is still a bit torn. Like if anyone asked me at any time if I could choose to be a girl instead of a boy, I'd choose a girl every time, but I still feel torn, maybe just cos of fear?  It makes it hard to go to the gym, cos I want to be fit and strong for my masculine presentation - but I don't want to even feel like I need that in the first place, and it feels dysphoric to be more muscular, but while presenting as a guy, I still want to feel good about how I look, and I want to keep fit.  


I'd also like to share some of my photos of me, and ask for some advice for how I look and what I can do, but I feel afraid to share any photos publicly - I'm not sure how I can be sure to trust anyone. It'd be nice to have some trans people to talk to though.  


If anyone got this far, thanks for listening to my little vent, I'm hoping someone can share some of their experience or give me some advice. I probably havent got everything I'd like to say off my chest, but it has already felt good to write up this.

If anyone is in the Central NY or Syracuse area and can recommend doctors or a better way to look I would appreciate it!

For everyone, in my search I came across several sites that LGBT friendly doctors can list themselves on. so if you have found yourself a good therapist, primary care, endo, surgeon, etc. you can encourage their office to list themselves on these sites! It would help all of us who have to move or people who come out and their doctor isn't supportive! (also if you know of a site with more doctors listed please send it my way!)

So I'm FtM from the UK and I'm turning 16 in less than 3 months and will be starting T as soon as I possibly can. I've been out for just under 3 years and been on blockers for about 2 and a quarter (thankfully the waiting time for a specialist wasn't as long as it is now), had my name changed legally, had my gender changed so that on documents I come up as male, been binding, packing occasionally and also growing out the slightest moustache I can grow naturally haha. Essentially I've done everything I can at this point.

I go to see my therapist again next month so we can go over next steps and make sure everything's okay ect. I know about the risks, potential changes, different methods of taking T, like everything because naturally as soon as I came out all I done was research, research, research lol. But I also know that a fertility sparing option will come up.

It was brought up last appointment to give me time to think about it. So now I have like 2 and a bit months to decide if I want the op or not? And like I honestly don't know? I've spoken about it with my mum and she's said it's my choice but that it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. But also that if I want children they don't have to be biologically mine to be MY kids.

Idk I just don't think I can make the choice on whether or not I want kids in the future when I'm only 15. I kinda wanna get it so I have it but I also don't wanna get it because it's really invasive and embarrassing.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Didn't experience much gender dysphoria as a young child, don't know if traumatic life events caused it, but it's been really hitting me a lot recently and I'm not sure if transitioning is the right solution.**

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my childhood, I don't remember suffering much dysphoria. I didn't feel an intense need to change my entire wardrobe or play with other toys. However, at around 9 or 10, I used to play this online game called Habbo Hotel where you would basically chat with other people online through avatars you could customize and play around with. I made a female avatar and that's when I first started pretending I was a girl, and for some reason it was a huge thrill. I convinced other people of it and I really liked interacting with them because they'd address me as a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

When puberty hit, it became a lot more intense. When I was 13 I became really infatuated with one of the girls at my school and I became weirdly obsessed with every detail about her. This is the first time I remember really wanting to be a girl, and for the next few years I always had a fantasy going on in my mind of switching bodies with her. That's also when I started investigating online about the process of transitioning, but I was immediately discouraged because of all the social and economic costs. Throughout this time I also continued pretending to be a girl online and liking it a lot, like I was expressing something I couldn't in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

At around 15, I got into a really terrible place in my life. I became very isolated, no friends or much contact with family, started to have very, very negative thoughts and jumped into the ""anti-SJW"" bandwagon that was rising in popularity. The suicidal thoughts I had from earlier in my life also increased in amount and intensity. Despite that, I found that a way to relieve my depression was to use messaging apps with random guys to send them pictures of my body so I could get a kick out of convincing them I was a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Three or four years down the road, my life became increasingly worse. I continued down the ""anti-SJW"" rabbit hole to the point where I became a full on neo-nazi, a time during which I would heavily repress my past feelings by actively fighting trans rights. Seeing where my body was going, however, always made me very uncomfortable. I intensely disliked having hair all over and I hated the shape of my legs and bottom. On the other hand, I also felt good about my more feminine aspects, like my neck and hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19 now, and after a long struggle I'm glad to have pulled myself out of the neo-nazi hole and I don't live life in constant dread anymore. But as a consequence, these feelings resurfaced and it's been worse than ever. I can't look at myself in the mirror, and if I do it's always a surreal experience, like I'm looking at someone else. I have to slap my face and claw at it until I'm in pain so I can snap out of it. I hate my body more than ever. The other day, I felt extremely uncomfortable talking and made the decision not to speak so I didn't have to hear the sound of my own voice. I don't feel like a man, and I feel really uncomfortable around them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to proceed from here. I'm scared that because of my age hormones wouldn't do anything, and I'm even more scared of the social consequences of transitioning. My entire family would hate me and I have nowhere else to go.

I told him yes, you are being an ass, and it’s not their burden to tell everyone and you should be able to respect their pronouns and name without directly being told by them.

Then I start screaming to myself that I just want a normal body and I hate it and regret everything about it.

I get tics sometimes. Usually at night. I woke myself up with tics this morning whilst screaming in my dream. Nearly twitched my head right of the edge of the bed.

I've felt dysphoria from not being fem enough. I've felt it from not being masc enough. But that was the worst feeling of body dysphoria I've ever experienced (even though it was a dream).

It felt like a visceral scream from my soul trying to express itself but no scream was intense enough to reflect the feeling or organic enough to communicate the pain and my robotic screams of anguish only reminded me that I was trapped forever.

After waking up, I'm considering throwing everything fem away and trying to ignore the whole idea of being able to modify my body with drugs or surgery (HRT is daunting but surgery terrifies me). I'm worried that although I feel bad now, if I transition and it doesn't get me to look how I ideally want, I'm gonna feel that same feeling of being trapped in anguish but it won't stop until I kill myself.

Am I even transgender or do I just associate attractiveness with femininity? If that's the case if I never pass I'll never feel attractive. I don't know if I have gender dysphoria or if I just hate my body and being part of the trans community warps my perceptions enough to cope but it'll all catch up with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I came out as transmasc to my husband and he was totally supportive and cool with that, asked about pronouns and all that, which I kind of got nervous about and panicked (I've been in this closet, like, the last 24 years, so it's going to take a little while to get all the way out there). 

&amp;#x200B;

It was not a \*complete\* surprise to him, as I had told him earlier this year and last that I'd been questioning some things n' stuff again, but I don't think he knew I'd continued being so conflicted and full of the angst that comes with the territory. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I have so much to explore now still and feel like I'm getting to know me again, but like the real, full me; like the other half I've ignored forever. It was really just nice to have that acceptance and I really like that it wasn't an Earth-shattering revelation for him, and has made me feel more secure in moving forward with my plans to start presenting more as male once I lose a few more pounds. Side note: I know I shouldn't use my gender as a weight loss goal but I had to get there somehow, lol. I know it's a fucked reward system but it's working XD 

&amp;#x200B;

So that was a thing, feeling a little bit more confident in all this now though and next I need outfits and a new name. And a really badly needed haircut. But really just feel like I can dig in to this now. My next big milestone of coming out is not for a while, and at some point I'll have to discuss with my kids probably.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this was unexpected and super duper wonderful extreme!

I've only been seeing my therapist for about a month now. After my egg cracked wide open beginning of June, dysphoria has been regularly kicking my ass and taking my lunch money. This was apparent to my therapist I guess, though our sessions are only 45 min and I never feel its enough time to talk, she saw it. 

Last week during our session, she gave me the number to her endocrinologist she likes so I could get a consultation on HRT (which happened 7/16/2019). She said that she gave me that number far quicker than anyone she has worked with in her 20+ years as she could tell I was in real distress and felt I needed it was time already. I'm not bragging that it was fast just shocked is all. I had been horrible depressed, I mean we all know how dysphoria gets but I didn't realize how bad it actually was getting. 

I spent 3 days after I got the endo docs number just completely a mess. I called out for work, slept a lot, played games to get my mind off it, smoked A LOT OF WEED to try and forget who I was. Obviously none of that helped. So I finally broke down after and made the call, which took some serious mental efforts to keep from losing it. Seriously, I felt so much better the rest of the week/weekend and I didn't even really notice it until I had my next therapy session. I guess just the thought knowing that I was going to begin to do something about this was enough to curve that pain a bit. My therapist noticed I was much happier when she saw me this week, so clearly that's a good sign I think.

 Well, I had my doc appointment yesterday and I start my shots next Tuesday!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'M SO EXCITED!!!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to go with injections as I wanted a delivery system that was more efficient and I like that you only have to do it every two weeks. Plus, I'm horribly lazy with certain things and I don't want to have to remember to take a pill every day. I plan on doing the pellets (a time release system they put under your skin I guess) because they last for 3 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fam, I'm so excited I don't even know what to do!! I really need to come out to my BFF so I can talk about it, but I still don't know how he will take the news.. suppose I should try to make some trans friends but I'm destructively introverted and its difficult for me to make and maintain friends as it is.  I do think part of it is how emotionless I usually am so people tend to think I don't like them or something.. anyway I'm rambling now..

&amp;#x200B;

Since I learned what hrt was, I knew that one day I wanted to go on testosterone. Getting a needle would be a small price to pay for a deeper voice, fat redistribution, maybe getting a tiny bit taller (but probably not, at 17 im mostly done growing), and I was even excited for getting more body hair even though it would make me look even more like a gorilla than I already do. 

In the past four or five years, my health has been getting worse. At first, it was developing depression and anxiety. Then chronic pain that made it hard to find motivation to get out of bed, especially combined with overwhelming fatigue. Then I started getting dizzy whenever I stand up, and nauseous most of the time, and having difficulty breathing and heart palpitations with chest pain. Over dozens and dozens of doctor and specialist appointments, they determined that I have fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and at least a few other things that still remain a mystery. 

The heart stuff is the most recent.

She then said that I might not be able to go on testosterone because nobody would want to prescribe it to me because of the potential it could make my heart stuff worse.

He's going off about how using 'they' as a pronoun is stupid, and then in the next breath says he doesn't discriminate. I told him, yes, he does, he actively discriminates against me, every day. He says how? I say because you call him (other coworker) by he/his pronouns and you use she/her for mine. He says that's because I was 'born a female.'

I told him that not using my prefered name or pronouns means, by definition, that he's transphobic. He insists that it doesn't. Like, if you're going to be a bigot, then whatever, I obviously can't change your mind. I've tried to educate him with facts and logic, but I guess he's too stupid to understand. I also tried to appeal to his sense of humanity and respect for others, but apparently he doesn't have that either. So his opinions of LGBTQ+ people are pretty set in stone, but do you really need to be a hypocrite on top of that? If you hate trans people then fking own it, don't sit there and say you've got an open mind when quite obviously you're full of fear and hate.

Maybe he doesn't like me calling him a transphobe because it makes him feel bad to be called by a term he doesn't identify with. Not like I have any idea what THAT is like. Raaaaaaaage.

I haven't changed my legal name or gender markers yet because I can barely afford rent right now, I don't have the hundreds of dollars needed to change all my ID. So I feel like I don't have a leg to stand on if I push the issue and try to demand my co-workers use my prefered name/pronouns. I'm in Canada so legally I can't get fired or whatever for being queer, but my boss could certainly make my life shitty if he wanted to. With the economy being so bad right now he could easily lay me off and put 'lack of work' as the reason, and I'd have no way to contest it. I can't afford to risk my employment. But I'm also really really really sick and tired of the constant misgendering. I'm sick of people consciously, willingly, and repeatedly stripping away my dignity with every single interaction I have with them.

2019-07-18 23:04:06,cezoqd,0,1,"Okay here goes. My generation is lucky. We wete the first to have internet and cable. I took that to full advantage growing up. I had aol, back in the day. One day i joined a chatroom. I began chatting and i got an IM from this girl. We chatted and became friends. So i added her. We began chatting about everyday. Shed tell me how hard it eas going to school, though i had the same feelings, being a tramsplant a relatively new still. One day, she wad depressed and talked of suicide. I was shocked. I eanted to help. So i asked her what wad bothering her. Now, notice she had sent me pictures prior, and she was so gorgeous! Well...she told me, a bomb at the moment, ""Im Trans"". I didnt know what she was talking about. She said search the terms. So I did. Then i said"" hey it doesnt matter anyway"" then we began our deep conversation on life.
   This opened up a whole new world for me. Ive never even kissed a girl before. Yet, here i am literally falling for this girl. We became good friends. Real close. She also pointed out other girls who were trans. I added them
 I also found a few. I wad only like 13 or 14. My interest grew. I knew then at 13, ""I wanted to marry a trans woman"". My friends list grew to obscure people around the world. My friend from NYC, goth , pot head, who always had a tif with his mother. Also a few older ladies, who to them my smitten attempts where cute, and i had to grow up. 
  Time passed by, i would stay in contact with them all. We'd talk all day throught the summer. When school rolled around wed keep eacher on the up n up, be thete for each othet. Buy, as late teens hit, they became distant a bit. My friends wrte now dating guys, and had problems dating. I didnt undetstand. I was absolutley smitten. Shoot, id date you, but distance wouldnt allow it. 
    I went to school at a place ehere we didnt have any trans women. We only had a few gay guys. I knew then i wasnt interested. Yet i had relationships with ladies, it just wasn't working. Id fond myself wishing she was trans although id never even been or even met a trans woman before. My friends on the other hand, in school, always played the "" if you had a million dollars would you"" game. One day the "" kiss a trans"" question hit. I said "" hell yea!"" Welp, then the rumors started. Even though it didnt bother me, n had validity. 
   I graduated school and left for my next adventure. After my initial engagement, while walking in amall i saw this tall beautiful lady. Mind you im still a little green. I noticed her! ""OMG. Thats the lady from that TV show!"" Indeed it wad here. Most of what i knew was my friends online, what i sawon TV i.e.  Springer or MTV. Yet it was her. I had a friend with me. I walked to her n said hi. She looked and smiled. Wr chatted. My friend was totally confused. "" DUDE shes a..."" She invited me to her place. I accepted. I was only 18. Her being my senior she knew what she was doing. We got to her pad, in which she had a friend with her. My friend pushed up on hers, as she and i talked passionately. OMG she invited me back. Uh oh! My friend was in dismay shaking his head. I went back. She undressed to her beautiful undergarments. Then kissed me. OMG! It happened. Yup! 
Well the word got around what happened. I wasridiculed for years. Even attacked a few times. I tried to keepin contact with her. She told me she was a working girl n i had to accept that. I had to learn the hard way. Things got so bad. I hadto cut it off. I couldnt love her the way she wanted n needed. I was also getting the worst. Yea, chicken shit. 
 Once i got used to it, while out in town i met a lady. She was strikingly beauriful. Mind you, i couldnt keep an ongoing relationship. Once the ""he ____ a trans"" came up i was single. Story of my life. But there was this lady. We talked. She told me all about her...in which i absolutely loved because i was into t, and didnt see it coming. Wr became friends. Lovers, of sort. Every weekend we spent together. Man i was in love. One say i asked her to marry me. It wasnt until i was 19 when i figured out i couldnt date a trans woman. I eas crushed. She cried all night. From my job, it wadnt too kind to the trans relationship thing. After so much attacks there and home. I packed my bags. She and friends begged me not to. Stating how umhappy i would be. 

 Returning home i hopped back on aol. A little experience now. I thought id learned up a bit. To my shock. My friemds were sex workers and in porn. They changed so much. One telling me we could hang out for money. Another bless her soul, was tired of the way guys treated her. She was from Jersey. I remember her screen name still lol. She was so cool. She would go on and on all day. Wed make plans but i had school and work. I wanted to be the guy to get her out of it. I temembered the innocent girl from our early teens. Here she is working now. Though she genuinely still was the same to me. Shed tell me things that just broke my heart. 
  After a bit of traveling and failed relationships, i had my fun. But coming from my family, it was so hard to tell them of my attraction. I ended up in a long relationship with a cis woman. It nearly destroyed me. So toxic. She knew of my attraction. She rubbed it in my face. Shed watch the xxx videos and say how how it was. Yet there i am conflicted. Finally it ended. 
 Now with it being ovet. Being older now, not too old though lol! I look back and regret yhe chances i didnt take. The ladys here are not into me. I dont make the most money. I sit missing my old AOL friends. Like im a good guy. 

Theres thos thing wete they say chaser. Well what about the guy who was interested wjem he first started being interested in anything? If you can begin to like guys, why cant guys begin to like you then, also? I think about my friends a lot. Especislly my one from NJ. She changed her name a few times. I knew she was in the field. I just wasnt her type anymore. Also, my others have changed so much, maybe i need to. Yet i remember then, when we were young and i was truly on your side. 

It sucks being into trans. I get stereotyped too much. Some guys really mess it up for us. I know theres someone for me...but theres no where to find you. Im not going to a club. Not my thing. I want the lady thats not always in the club i guess. Around here most of the ladies are on the scene or are in some tight knit community. So good luck for us normies.

What do i do? Ive attempted suicide more than a few times over this matter. I also have had crushing depression. I know i need to move.

And so i posted here. I just really need a little hope i guess. Sometimes i feel that the guys who truly like and would be serious with trans women have it the worst. Even the ladys treat us bad.

AFAB. I do not believe that I am transgender, as I do not connect fully to the idea of being male. However, I grew up with a lack of connection to my assigned gender, and I feel like the disassociation has grown over time. I went from not feeling connected to being a girl to wishing my voice was deeper, or my chest was more flat. Socially, I tolerate being called ""she"" but male pronouns make me comfortable.

I understand though, that this does not mean that I am a guy. Maybe I am a man in denial, but for now, this is a very hard thing for me to accept. I'm not sure what to do. Should I try to be a woman, or see what living as a man for a while is like? 

From what I understand, a lot of trans people just seem to *know* that they are the opposite gender from the start. It's not something you ""test out"". I only thought/saw myself as male for a few short periods throughout my life, and although I enjoy/enjoyed it, committing fully to male is not a decision that I could see myself making right now. If it's possible, I want to work out these feelings as much as I can before coming to any type of conclusion.

TL;DR: I don't feel female, and feel comfortable when presenting as male. Does that mean that I *am* a guy, or that I just like socially presenting as one? I know that your gender identity is a very personal thing, and that the only one that really knows what you are for certain is you, but some clarification on this would be *deeply* appreciated.

I don't exactly know what I'm looking for, but I've been up all night thinking again and I just feel like I need to shout this out there somewhere. 

I hate my language, czech, everything is so overly gendered, every verb, everything, you put your gender there and it makes me very aware of how uncomfortable I feel having to use the female gendered brand of everything. Literally everything feels like it has a specific gender to me and I can't stop thinking that way. I hate talking to people in Czech and for the longest time I thought it was just the way the language was that made me feel weird, but it's how gendered everything is. I just can't call myself a female and be comfortable with it and feel like I'm being honest with people.

I like goth fashion and I thought I didn't like wearing dresses n stuff cause it wasn't goth enough and I watched a video recently of a goth guy dressing in the most goth shit I've ever seen and my mind was screaming ""yes I wish I looked like that"". But I don't... I'm the most female person on Earth, there's no denying the way I was born, so why do I not appreciate the curves, my chest and all of that? I should be happy!

I should mention I'm very adept at denial. I've been diagnosed with bpd, depression and generalized anxiety disorder, but most of the time I'm like ""depression what? Lmao no way, I'm happy af"" and I believe it. That's why I find it so hard to nail down my gender. 

I came out to my mom as bi with a PowerPoint presentation that included gender and sexuality. And.. well, at that time I secretly ordered a binder and it felt so nice not having my giant chest just be there, but after I showed my mom the presentation I made, she made fun of trans people and I very promptly shoved the binder I spend all my money on under my bed and wore dresses and skirts and all that, it didn't feel right but I thought it just wasn't goth enough.

Now I have the best girl goth clothes I could ever want, but it's still not quite there. And that goth guy, he.. he wore exactly everything I ever wanted to wear and it made me think about this for days and nights straight. I want to look like him, I want people to look at me and call me a he, a handsome guy, a boy, their boyfriend, their guy friend, but I can't accept those feelings.

I don't have any friends, pride starts in Czech republic next month and I'd feel like a fraud going dressed there as a female or as a male, so I'm thinking of not going but I think I need to... I'm just scared of talking to people in Czech and having to gender every noun I say when I'm so confused my head is gonna explode..

I want to look like him, I want people to look at me and call me a he, a handsome guy, a boy, their boyfriend, their guy friend, but I can\'t accept those feelings.\n\nI don\'t have any friends, pride starts in Czech republic next month and I\'d feel like a fraud going dressed there as a female or as a male, so I\'m thinking of not going but I think I need to... I\'m just scared of talking to people in Czech and having to gender every noun I say when I\'m so confused my head is gonna explode..\n\nThat\'s it, thanks for reading, any advice will be much welcome.

i am a straight male (biologically). for the past two years i've wondered if i am trans.

I have a fetish of genderswapping / gender change. when i masturbate, i like to imagine i have a pussy and pretend to masturbate like i have one (even though it doesn't do anything, the thought turns me on). outside from when i am aroused or in the mood, I generally don't think at all of being a woman, but just about every time when I am aroused I either imagine being in the womans position or being a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

i've been lurking on this sub for quite some time, reading peoples ""how i learned/knew i was trans"" posts, but none of them really sound similar to what i've felt. the closest i've stumbled across is someone mentioning that in games he played he always chose to play female characters, which is something i too have done for as long as i remember, but i'm not really going to realize my gender identity based on an unimportant option in videogames lol

2019-07-20 11:02:10,cfkmvi,8,0,"I'm a cis woman writing a neuroscience essay about the differences between male and female brains. I could really use some help from a wider range of gender perspectives, particularly trans and nonbinary.

The idea is this: When I talk about ""men"" and ""women,"" I'm talking about two poles of a spectrum. If you look at the large swath of the population born ""male"" (born with typical but by no means universal XY chromosomal expression), you see common tendencies: more aggression, more overt competition, more linear thinking, etc. 

And same with those born ""female"" — more connected thinking, more nurturing. That's not to say all men act like the ""average"" man — plenty of men, cis and trans, are more nurturing than plenty of women. Plenty of women are more aggressive than plenty of men. That's why taking hormones can change behavior. A trans woman taking testosterone can start feeling more competitive. 

So in the essay, I'd be writing about a whole bunch of ways things like testosterone and estrogen can affect how men and women behave. Real ""men"" and ""women"" do not really fall squarely into two separate buckets — it's more of a Venn diagram. But for the purposes of not having an incredibly wordy essay, I want to use the words ""man"" and ""woman"" as useful categories for talking about these sex/gender-associated personality differences.

There is something we as a community need to confront and have an open discussion about:

But outside-looking-in on our community, its often misconstrued that our lives are an ultimate demonstration of sexism - especially for people like me who don’t pass.

2019-07-20 21:11:17,cfqy8i,1,9,"Hey could you give me some help on my coming out letter, I just wanna know if there anything I could make better before I deliver it! Thanks!

Dear Mum or Dad,

I wanted to do this in person but I felt it would be easier for both of us for me to leave you a note instead. The so called 'Issue' we've been putting off for so many months isn't something I want to hide anymore. I can't. It hurts me to hide who I really am.

I understand that you don't understand Gender Dysphoria (Transgender) and I know it's hard for you to come to terms with it but believe me. It's 10x harder for me. This isn't something that can go away. It can't be hidden without negatively affecting my mental health. It makes me feel depressed and that's not something I should have to live with.

Being like this isn't a choice. It's not something I want to be, it never is with Gender Dysphoria. It'll never go away, it's part of me just as much as my favourite colour or my love of cats. I can claim they've gone away when really there still there. Gender Dysphoria is caused by a hormone imbalance in the early stages of life. No one makes it happen, it just sorta happens to some people. No one's at fault.

Nothing has changed about me except I'm more open about it. I want to build trust between us and open doors for me to be able to talk to you. This is the great secret I've hidden since I was a toddler. I always knew I was different, I just never knew I had the guts to do anything about it.

All I ask from you is to accept me and work with me. I want nothing to change between us. All I want is to live the life I want to live. I only have 1 life, I don't wanna live that life depressed and full of self hate. And that's why I need to 'Transition'.

I know what your thinking: ""It'll be harder for you to get a job!"" ""We would have to move!"" ""It's difficult to Transition!"". They are legitimate concerns, however none of them actually apply. 1: How would I get a job? Companies can't discriminate against employees for being trans, the backlash is too big from the media and the lawsuit wouldn't be worth it. The world's a different place. Also companies strive for diversity nowadays so are more prone to hiring trans people than ever! 2: We would have to move! Really? Would we? People care a lot less about others lives than you think. I know at least 3 trans people in kingsteignton and not one has been run out of town. There been no protests, no riots. The world's a different place. Also theres legal protection to stop that happening under harassment laws. It just doesn't really happen anymore. 3: it's difficult to Transition! No it isn't. HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) could mean that I'm unrecognisable in 6 months to 2 years. Seriously look up Transwomen HRT. There's a reason it's been called magic. Now I know NHS waiting lists to get HRT is 3 years however there is a private system I can use that would cost £200 for an appointment and as long as my GP agrees to work with them I can get the Hormones on the NHS and Blood tests whenever needed.

I hope this helps, and I hope it will allow you to understand what I'm going through.

Please for my sake think about this with a fresh mindset and try to put yourself in my shoes, however hard that may be. I'm only trying to do what's best for me.

2019-07-20 22:00:08,cfrh7s,0,3,"Hey folks! I’m Avery (they/them) and I’m looking for more people to come share some of their experiences or beliefs surrounding faith and gender on my podcast. I’m looking especially for interviewees who are POC and/or transfeminine. 

Blessed Are the Binary Breakers is a podcast that interviews trans and/or nonbinary persons about their experiences with faith and gender. 
The goal of this podcast is to gather the stories of as many transgender and/or nonbinary people as possible, from as many faiths and countries and perspectives and backgrounds as possible. (Find out where to listen to / read previous eps here: transchristianity.com/podcast)

I am thrilled about how many different voices have been shared with me so far – we’ve gotten to hear from people from the United States, from Poland, and from Indonesia; people in their teens and twenties and people in their forties and fifties; folks who are Christian, Jewish, atheist, Muslim, and more. 
But so far, I have failed at reaching more people of color, and more trans women or nonbinary people assigned male at birth. We’ve gotten to hear from a few such people so far, but this podcast is currently overwhelmingly white and features many more people assigned female at birth than amab people. 

This is a problem particularly when you look at the fact that transgender people of color, and transfeminine people, and especially Black trans women face even greater levels of violence and have even less access to resources than the rest of us. 

Too often, those of us who are white have more access to life-saving resources than our transgender siblings of color. Spaces that are meant to be friendly and helpful to all trans people end up being racist and misogynistic and hurting trans people of color and trans women who try to get help from them. Those of us who are white have our voices amplified more frequently than theirs. And while we face violence too, they face so much more because of their intersecting identities. 

So I want to extend an invitation specifically to transgender and nonbinary people who belong to one or both of the following categories:

- If you’re a trans woman, or transfeminine, or otherwise assigned male at birth; and/or
- If you’re a person of color. 

And just to make it clear, if you’re interested in being on the show, you would be welcome to talk about anything you want to talk about. Anything that you’d prefer not to have to talk about, you don’t have to! You can make it as serious or laid-back as you want; I always want to leave it to the interviewee to set the mood. So if you want to come on and talk about racism and transmisogyny, you’re totally welcome to – but if you’d rather not talk about that stuff at all, there’s no pressure from me to. You can talk about your personal journey as a whole or just a couple anecdotes from it, or share your favorite things about your faith tradition, what you think about um the divine, what you think about gender, whatever else you want to talk about!
You all deserve to share your stories; and the rest of us need to listen to your voices, your stories, your wisdom. It is my privilege to host this podcast that allows me to amplify voices; I want to do better at using this special opportunity to amplify the voices at the margins of the margins. 

So yeah, if you are transfeminine and/or a person of color, please reach out to me at queerlychristian36@gmail.com if you would be interested in appearing on this show! Thank you!!

But ever since I was at least like 17 or so I find myself constantly fantasizing about being a woman and having a woman's body. I've had a deep desire to know what it's like to be feminine in both a personal, social, and sexual situations. 

I'd want female friends that I did girl stuff with. Talk to girls where the dynamic of me being a ""straight boy"" didn't exist. 

I'd want to be desired by men. Be pretty and cute. Get hit on. Have guys fight over me. Be shorter and weaker than my boyfriend. Get lifted up off my feet. Get physically dominated in bed. Become pregnant, and keeping life in my body for 9 months.  

I'd even want to be all by myself female. It would be fun to have that kind of a body. 

If there was a button that would turn me female forever, I would push that button. 

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand, I also really like being a dude. I like flexing in the mirror. I like climbing trees and wrestling dogs, humans, etc. Being able to run faster and smash things better than most of the people I know is fun. Obviously women can do all of that stuff too, but I enjoy doing that *as a man.* I enjoy the masculine imagery and identity of it. 

And sexually, being stronger and more aggressive than my female partners is also fun. I feel no dysphoria in being dominant towards women. 

&amp;#x200B;

The times I feel dysphoria are the rare occasions when I'm trying to be sexual with a dude (which I would prefer to do as a female), and my masculine characteristics become all too apparent. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it was a simple decision, I would give up all the joys of being a man so that I could be a woman. But I won't, because it's not a simple decision. And there is no magic button. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really trying to give you my life story. I just want to know if there's a name for what I am. 

I rarely really *do* anything trans. A lot of people just think I'm a red blooded cishet man. But I watch videos and fantasize in my own head a lot.

2019-07-21 14:58:33,cfzvan,0,1,"Hi everyone, I'm writing because one of my best friends is trans, and the past year or two have been particularly difficult for her.

She was my roommate in college (not out at the time, otherwise she wouldn't have been allowed to share a dorm room), and while she's known she's trans for years and years, she only came out to me about a year ago.  She's out publicly now, going through hormone therapy, and getting closer all the time to feel like she's passing.

Anyway, I often get private messages from her detailing her latest reactions that she has had to various anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications, as well as struggles with applying for jobs, dealing with transphobic family members, lack of a support network, and even suicide attempts.  I'm having two issues:

1. I live two thousand miles away from her--I moved back to the Midwest after college, from the west coast, and she's still out there.  All I can really do is offer my support--and, when she asks for it, advice.
2. I'm a cis dude.  While I would 100% consider myself an ally and in full support of the trans community, I can't begin to say that I've experienced anything on the level that she's gone through.  I try to sympathize and empathize, but that obviously can only go so far.

I want to be as much help as I can, but I'm running out of ways to respond to her messages in a supportive fashion.  I want her to know that I'm always there to lend support, help, and an ear, but my biggest fear is that my responses are going to become rote or start to come off as blase--just because I don't know what else to say.  I'm not particularly great at coming off as genuine, even when I'm trying to be.  I suppose I'm mainly wondering with folks who are trans--when you've been in your darker places, what have you wanted to hear?  Is there something I can do aside from just continuing to say that I'm always behind her and available to talk?

2019-07-21 17:45:19,cg1rgr,0,1,"(first post here, first post ever about what I'm feeling inside... AMAB)

&amp;#x200B;

So... I need some feedback and advice.  I woke up this morning after having a week-long very dark feeling overtake me.  It's a pattern that I've repeated many many years....  it goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

I get word that I have some free/alone time coming up in the place that I live, I go buy some more feminine clothes, some makeup, body shapers, etc... I get the alone time and dress up trying on all the clothes, posing, just hanging out in relaxing clothes, try different make-up styles.  I get somewhat satisfied at being able to look more feminine, but then I get disgusted by how far from feminine I am, go dark in my whole being and then purge all my clothes at some point when housemates/partners/friends come back and I don't have that alone time.  I go back to being the masculine self everyone knows.

&amp;#x200B;

This cycle has happened at least a dozen times in my life... from being first on my own at 18, to being at college in my early 20's, then those rare weekends I got the house to myself when my wife was out of town for a workshop.  She is too small to borrow clothes from, so I would have to sneak stuff here and there and pass it off as burning man gear.  Now, we're separated and living in separate towns, and I am subletting a room in SF.  

&amp;#x200B;

But, now, my only housemate is out of the country for a few weeks and I have gone further than I ever have before with a gaffe, body shaping corset, hip enhancers... and I have a C-cup breast plate showing up in a week :o  ... I just went out yesterday with only a little eye makeup on and felt terrified.  I'm about to go out in male clothes but with all my body shaping gear underneath.  

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up this morning reading all of the MtF and transition stories here on Reddit and am now terrified I actually might be trans (as opposed to just convincing myself I'm gender queer or just drawn to occasionally presenting more feminine to trusted female friends).  Reading the stories and feeling how right it feels to be more feminine I got one tiny glimpse of joy in my heart about being free... crazy, but wearing a tight gaffe and stretch jeans with dainty sandals makes me feel so alive.  And, I'm kinda both disgusted with myself and fighting with myself inside to just go all out and be as free and feminine as I want where I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine ever telling my family, my work, by (ex/separated) wife... my kids!  I read this morning, too, that some California planned parenthood can help with prescribing HRT and I will be setting up an appointment this week.  But, to me, it feels like a dead-end... I almost want to go on HRT and hide the changes from everyone but a couple of close female friends... go as far as I can on the hormones and then when it's too far to turn back, I would just disappear.  I want to live out my fantasy as a woman but not actually go all the way, killing both her and him :(

&amp;#x200B;

Oh... and to add to this, I have been happily hetero for so long (a couple of my female friends have referred to me as a lesbian stuck/caught in a man's body).  But... I had a full on penetrative encounter with a guy last weekend and had two full-on full-body feminine orgasms that just make me want more of that... to give into a man's desire and be as pretty and submissive as I can.  But, then I imagine how masculine I must look in my soft clothes and bad make-up and just want to kill myself again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this is something of a long story, but I'll try to keep it brief. My oldest friend came out as trans to me yesterday. We've known each other 13 plus years, and for those 13-ish years she's the closest thing to a brother I've ever had (Common thing I told her.)   


She dropped this on me in an incredibly casual manner, some joke about lesbians being the only friends I have was made and she laughed and said ""Yeah and now I am too."" Turned out she was being casual about it and genuinely thought she had already come out to me, which caused a small amount of confusion.   


""Wait, what?""   


""Oh, uh, yeah, am girl.""   


""Seriously?""   


""Yup. Am girl.""   


""Huh. Cool.""  


We sat and talked for ages, she's yet to come out to her folks or really anyone aside from her sister and her friendgroup. She's still working up the courage to do so. She still acts exactly the same (Gets super excited over board games/RPGs, makes puns, etc), wears the same clothes, hasn't yet even considered a name change, etc. etc. And she's sworn me to general secrecy, so when my dad was sitting and gaming with us, I was still referring to her as a boy. Also typing her pronouns is so much easier than saying them, and that makes me feel like shit.  


So I guess by now you're all wondering why I made this post. Basically, to sum up, I've never been close friends with someone who was trans, and I love my friend with all my heart. She's a bit weird, no doubt, but we grew up together. What are good ways to support someone, especially someone who isn't entirely out of the closet yet? I really don't know what I'm doing, and she doesn't really know either. What problems might occur, and what's something you wish a friend did/was able to provide while you were coming out?

Am girl.""   \n\n\n""Huh. Cool.""  \n\n\nWe sat and talked for ages, she\'s yet to come out to her folks or really anyone aside from her sister and her friendgroup. She\'s still working up the courage to do so. She still acts exactly the same (Gets super excited over board games/RPGs, makes puns, etc), wears the same clothes, hasn\'t yet even considered a name change, etc. etc. And she\'s sworn me to general secrecy, so when my dad was sitting and gaming with us, I was still referring to her as a boy. Also typing her pronouns is so much easier than saying them, and that makes me feel like shit.  \n\n\nSo I guess by now you\'re all wondering why I made this post. Basically, to sum up, I\'ve never been close friends with someone who was trans, and I love my friend with all my heart. She\'s a bit weird, no doubt, but we grew up together. What are good ways to support someone, especially someone who isn\'t entirely out of the closet yet? I really don\'t know what I\'m doing, and she doesn\'t really know either. What problems might occur, and what\'s something you wish a friend did/was able to provide while you were coming out?

Let me start from the beginning. This happened while on a recent trip to Thailand, during my last week in the country. I was having a blast, taking in all the sights and sounds around me. I'd go out every day, and stay out all night, getting lost and immersed in the culture. I think I took it a little too far this time. I was messaging a girl on Tinder. She wasn't drop-dead gorgeous, but seemed interested in hooking up. Fine, I thought. I could use some casual, no-strings-attached sex. I was doing some sightseeing up North at the time, but didn't mind making the hour-long drive to her apartment.

Immediately after arriving there, and meeting this random Tinder girl in person, I could tell that something was wrong. First, she used a different name than the one on her profile. The name that she wanted me to call her was entirely too European for an Asian girl, and felt contrived. I honestly couldn't tell if she was trying to convince me, or herself, that it was really her name, but I let it slide.

Second, she spoke in an completely unnatural way. Her voice was high-pitched, but didn't sound feminine. It sounded cartoonish. But again I let it slide. Besides, my phone was dead, and I was in an unfamiliar area. I needed to use her charger if I ever wanted to get back to my place. I sat beside her on the bed, one thing lead to another, and soon we started making out.

Her skin was soft. Like a woman's. I've never met a man with skin that soft, so I started to wonder if maybe it was all in my head. I wanted to run, but I didn't want to run if she was really a woman. I took off her shirt, and started sucking on her breasts. I could feel the implants. I pulled back, and saw little hairs growing from around her nipples. I was absolutely repulsed, but was unable to say or do anything before she started going down on me. I was semi-erect, and she told me to finish.

I didn't know what the fuck to do. I felt like running away, but I was tired and confused, and erect, and didn't know how to make a clean getaway. So I grabbed a bottle of lube that was sitting on the nightstand, closed my eyes, and finished. I then got the fuck out as fast as I could.

Looking back on it, I feel deceived. Not once did I ever get those warm, happy, tingly feelings that I get when hooking up with a biological female. Not in the beginning. Not during the climax. I should also mention that I'm normally a pretty accepting person, but this experience certainly caught me off guard. If I'm being honest, I feel like I hooked up with an Asian boy.

Id have a better chance of informing and persuading if I had a better understanding. Please do not be upset if I phrased something wrongly or insensitively and let me know if I did so. I wrote this because I feel my stances are not comprehensive enough and want to change that. I have nothing but good intentions. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I (think) understand:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Gender and sex are different; sex refers to the biological sex organs you possess, while gender is how this is expressed to the public.

\-Sex is not a binary, but a binomial distribution of sexual organs, in which people can fall in between male and female a number of ways. These also differ in how much hormonal influence they have.

\-Gender is how you identify yourself in relation to your sex, cis meaning you identify as/with your sex and trans meaning you don't. (I dont fully grasp nonbinary which I ask about below)

&amp;#x200B;

General questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Is being trans referring to how a personal view of certain sex assignments, particularly what they mean for personal expression, dont apply to your own identity? I think this devolves into a nature v nurture argument, since society can shape what people view as masculine or feminine.

\-What is gender expression? Is this just referring to how you express typical or atypical male/female mannerisms that reflect your gender identity?

\-Does non-conforming mean that your personal relationship between your sex and gender doesnt have a part in your self identity? I.e. you wouldnt say ""Im a man from \[a place\]"" when describing yourself, rather you wouldnt refer to your gender in general.

\-What is a nonbinary/non-conforming gender? Is this just a way to refer to someone's unique personality that possibly blends male or female expressions?

\-I just read that gender dysphoria refers to the anxiety and distress a transgender person would feel due to their gender identity not aligning with their sex, not the misalignment itself. Is that correct?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Being transgender or nonbinary seems to me to be nearly synonymous with personal identity or personality. These things are how you feel on the inside and how that relates to your expression with the world. I believe that people are able to express themselves any way they want and that being labeled male or female shouldn't really determine how you do so. However I can understand how being labeled in that way can put pressures on one to express in typical fashions. Is this a core issue with trans people? I also wonder about how these expressions seem to depend on cultural norms. Men and women in a different time or place may have different cultural expectations than today.

I don't live with my dad, and don't know him too well, so I don't know about his opinion on trans but I know for definite my mom is EXTREMELY against it.

I've been trying to slowly transition, I have my name that I tell my friends, (though the only super supportive friends are online a--) and I'm slowly cutting my hair shorter and shorter and buying boyish clothes. The next step is a binder, but the only excuse I can give to my mom about buying it is cosplay, but if she finds out I'm wearing it to school she'll definitely get sus.

In fact, she already IS sus, she 'confronted' me a while ago asking why my attitude is so boyish and telling me I need to ""accept your femininity"" saying I should wear dresses and makeup for things other than cosplay, and making a fuss out of the one time I didn't let her force me in to a dress for a party and instead wore a suit.

my school, luckily, is really open and supportive of trans, and lets trans students change their name on the register to their chosen name. I plan on slowly transitioning and then coming out to my school and friends via a name change on the register.

So boom! That's the plan, but

how do I come out to unsupportive friends?? My unsupportive mom? What about my dad (I rarely ever get to talk to him)??

Throughout my time on this account, I've asked questions, answered other people's based off of my own experiences, etc. It was different today. I think because of how many people in the trans subs here that I've come to relate with, I finally cracked. And I'm not talking about the metaphorical egg. [I truly cracked.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cgv7a5/i_need_help_or_someone_to_talk_to/) I left my job abruptly today. I'm not in trouble, but I probably concerned a few people unnecessarily. I came home, cried, and slept for most of the day, hoping it would even itself out. My mom came to me today, and we talked. Today I was going to cw: trigger phrase""&amp;gt;!kill myself!&amp;lt;"", or a big part of myself today. I was going to officially declare myself cis male, erase all my history of anything trans or questioning. Sell my clothes that I worked to build into my coming out wardrobe, and hope for the best. I don't know who here is religious, or spiritual, or believes in the power of the universe, etc. But I yelled at the universe today. And it answered back. When me and my mom talked.. it was just so different. She actually brought up a child that she comes across throughout her day at work. And how she's upset that the kids mess with this child, because they identify as trans, but they're still figuring themselves out. And she started to cry, and it was so specific that she brought this up so I started to tear up and I finally came out to her. It kind of happened so fast that I didn’t realize I finally said it until after I confirmed it again. 

She accepts it. She even asked if I dressed up. It felt weird like I was being probed but she did it from a place of genuine curiosity and love and I showed her and she was very normal about it. Even asked me how I did my makeup. Like... WHAT!? We continued to talk and she knows. She knows that I still have questions. She knows that this may not be a phase and doesn’t care if it isn’t. She just wants me to know that she is accepting and still loves me. 

I still feel pretty depressed today. But I finally have some closure which is something I never thought I’d get, and almost gave up on. I honestly still have so many emotions going on in my head. I guess the best way to sum up how I feel is.. “I’m out of the closet, but I’m not out of the woods yet!”  

I kind of feel like I can let go of this account name. Start new and true I suppose. I don’t know. As I’m typing this I really am starting to feel happy. I still don’t have the help I want or need yet. But I have ears that care to listen. And I never speak about my problems.

I know Blaire White is a controversial figure amongst the trans community, but this video is a pretty in depth dive into a figure in the trans community that is an actual child predator. Because of Jessica (who still uses her dead name Jonathan on her twitter) Yaniv’s status as a “trans-woman,” she is being used as an example by transphobic communities to spread misinformation.

&gt;According to friends' and colleagues' online posts, Grigoryeva was worried about her safety after she found her name and personal information listed on the snuff site. 
&gt; 
&gt;“I learned today that Lena asked a mutual friend to take care of her cat in the event of her death when she was threatened with murder,” [friend and fellow activist Dinar Idrisov wrote on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DinarSpbRu/posts/14256124609..). 
&gt; 
&gt;“The state of Russia was obliged to guarantee her the right to life,” Idrisov wrote. **“Lena and her lawyer appealed to law enforcement agencies both on the fact of violence and on the fact of threats, but there was no noticeable reaction.”** 
&gt; 
&gt;On Tuesday, Idrisov updated his post to note that Grigoryeva's mother had identified her body and that investigators in St. Petersburg had taken over the case. Other activists said on social media that Grigoryeva's body was found near her home over the weekend with stab wounds and signs of strangulation, The Moscow Times reported. 
&gt; 
&gt;On July 18, just **days before she was killed, Grigoryeva** [**posted an alert on her Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/lgbtnet/photos/a.17863967892..) **about the “Saw” website.** 
&gt; 
&gt;Grioryeva wrote that the site, which organizes a “hunt for homosexual, bisexual and transgender people,” went online in spring 2018 and was shut down several times but always popped back up. **The website posted the personal data of “presumably LGBT+” activists, “including photos and addresses,” and offered prizes to those who completed an attack.** 
&gt; 
&gt;**“Law enforcement agencies have still not done anything to find the creators of this ‘game’ and bring them to justice,”** Grigoryeva wrote. She called on those opposed to the website to contact the Russian prosecutor’s office and the FSB, Russia’s intelligence agency. 
&gt; 
&gt;“IMPORTANT!” Grigoryeva wrote. “The Russian LGBT network has repeatedly tried to find people affected by the actions of this group, but failed. We did not find a single attack case directly related to this group.” 
&gt; 
&gt;**Three days after her post, Grigoryeva was dead.** 

And finally, 

&gt;**Police in St. Petersburg confirmed she had reported being threatened repeatedly, but said the threats had not seemed a risk to her life and were related to domestic conflicts** with people she knew, the RBC media portal reported 

But *there's actually more*. An [article from the official Russian investigative committee site](https://sledcom.ru/news/item/1376526/) (Russian) also says that 

&gt;...a previously convicted man from the Kyrgyz Republic, born 1981, was detained-— 
&gt; 
&gt;She lead antisocial lifestyle and often got drunk, sometimes in the company of the suspect 

That's **Russian victim blaming classics**. Tell how bad and antisocial the victim was to imply that she *deserved* it and that her death is not significant anyway. Blame a foreigner who already was a criminal. A scum killed a scum during an argument, nothing to see here folks. And a big fat lie. A *social activis*t lead an *anti-social lifestyle*? Was repeatedly getting drunk with sketchy types? And he *just happened* to kill her right after her name appeared on an anti-gay website and she knew they were after her? It is not certain whether the suspect was a member of Saw (or just not said) but there are too many coincidences. 

&amp;#x200B; 

**LGBT people are forced to leave the country.** They receive death threats and threats that their loved ones will be killed. [Here are screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/qmDQwll) (Russian) of the threats Artyom Shitukhin, who is also on the list, received, and his story about how they tried to burn his house. 

In short, after the attempt he ran to Netherlands and they told him to pay for his friend's ticket too or he'll be dead in a few days. 

&amp;#x200B; 

**Tomorrow we may wake up to another victim.** Spread the word. How many people must die so Russian authorities acknowledge the problem? The world can't let it continue, can't let Russian LGBT people live in fear and wonder whether it's their last day alive. We need collective action to stop the gay hunting.

2019-07-26 02:44:09,chx8r9,0,6,"Hey people! I’m a student in cosmetology school and I’m also a trans woman. I absolutely love helping people feel more like themselves and I try to put a lot of thought into how to accentuate masculine or feminine features using makeup or by changing hair styles. So here I’m gonna type out some of the major tips I have!

First you’ll have to identify your face shape. The basic shapes are: oval, round, square, triangle, and heart shaped. For trans feminine people, usually you are looking to slim your face down, and round it out. For trans masculine people, you’ll do the opposite, focusing on harsher lines and making your face more wide or flat.

So how do we do that? Soooo many ways! First we will focus on trans feminine people, since I know it best being a trans woman. You have so many options to explore! First let’s talk about hair, to be feminine you don’t have to have long hair. Long hair alone doesn’t bring out feminine features, but what you can do with that hair does. Bangs are great, but not all bangs are the same. Blunt bangs are beautiful, but the harsh line that it causes will make your face appear wider, and to an extent that continues to your shoulders and body because it leads your eyes to search for hard lines. Wispy bangs are my favorite choice, they are dense enough to cover up those pesky forehead lines, but they are still nice and flowy. For my short haired sisters, don’t be afraid of product! Personally I have a mullet with the sides shaved and I love using hairspray to keep it looking edgy. Wearing your hair going in a forward direction is usually a good idea, as most pixi cuts tend to motion forward.

Now for my trans masculine friends! This tends to be a lot easier to obtain, my greatest suggestion is to go to a barbershop or a salon and ask for a 321 fade, or if you are feeling real edgy, ask for a bald fade. And for the top, a comb over or pompadour work amazing, especially with a clean lineup. These will show your forehead more and look super clean with not too much product. Invest in some good quality pomade or styling clay. Paul Mitchell has some great options for everything men’s grooming, that’s what I use on all my men’s cut clients!

Makeup time! This also heavily relies on face shape because I’m gonna focus more on contour and highlight. Same rules apply as far as sliming and widening features, but this is where you can realllly make some magic. Trans feminine people, you’ll want to contour your cheekbones to appear higher, to do this you can suck in your cheeks to find your cheek bones and then contour on or just above them, and then you can go in a c shape to above right by your eyebrow. My next favorite thing is to contour my jawline to make it seem softer and to make my chin look more flat and soft. This is super easy, all you have to do is apply contour to your jawline and blend it in. Boom, done. Highlight is super simple too, just a little bit above your cheekbones, between your brows, down the bridge of your nose, the tip of your nose, and sometimes your chin. Eyebrows go a long way too, you can do them in so many ways! Eyeshadow, pencil, pomade, try whatever you can and find your favorite! I use a pomade and I love it. Your main goal is to follow your natural brow, but soften and round off a little, also to fill in any more scarce places. Also go get your brows done! It feels amazing, and makes your life a lot easy when it comes to makeup. 

Now trans masculine people! Makeup typically isn’t viewed as masculine, but why can’t guys have fun with it too? My first tip of advice is to use a foundation that isn’t full coverage, this will let your skin look more natural but sill give you a bace for the rest of your look. Contour again is gonna be our friend. You’re gonna want to contour your cheekbones on or lower and then blend down. Make sure to really blend to keep that very natural look. With your brows, focus on making those very defined hard lines, I suggest either a pomade or pencil for this. 

That’s all I got guys! These were things that I wasn’t seeing much online and that I had to learn myself to help my dysphoria. Please if you have more advice put it down in the comments! And feel free to pm me if you need help!

So I’ve been really productive all month. Been good for the majority of the time. Tuesday, started crashing and burning a little. Assumed I was just burnt out, right? Rest would fix that. Turns out, that’s not the case.

I’ve been sleeping restlessly all week because I typically sleep in late, and I’ve been trying to be mindful of my landlady, who’s showing off my apartment (I’m moving next month). So I’ve set a thousand alarms from 8 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon. I usually am lights out by 2:30. So I’m not getting a whole ton of sleep.

Volunteering. I volunteer twice a week.  Called in sick earlier in the week. I have to go tomorrow though in order to get volunteer benefits from disability. So...hooray to that. Just great.

Finances are running low. Trying to pack. Trying to get my proof of citizenship paperwork. Wanting to apply for loans. Then, last night, I hear from my brother. Turns out, my estranged mother wants one of the designs she has of mine as a tattoo. She has two, on two mugs: a self-portrait I drew, and two koi fish. I, being a reasonably sane person, assume she wants the koi fish. Nope. She wants the manga-style, anatomy-void self-portrait I did several years ago that now looks nothing like me and, as it turns out, was from before I realized I was trans. Took a look at it today to see if I would be okay with it and....nooooooooooo.

Finally sit down this evening and think back to how stressed and anxious I’ve felt, fighting dysphoria - and my autistic tendencies - and the ever-delightful self-esteem - and I finally wonder what time in my cycle it is and if that’s contributing.

I am a cis woman in my 40s. I was born female, and accept that I am female. Despite that, and I know it's not 'the PC term' these days, the phrase 'man trapped in a woman's body' is how I feel. My hormones have been out of whack my whole life -- I tend to have more testosterone than usual, and have several times been mistaken as a man, especially when I used to wear sports bras. It genuinely feels like something got mixed up when I was being made. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being tans, though, doesn't appeal to me. It just feels too incomplete, a 'close enough' fix, like putting a band-aid on a wound that needs stitches. I am more than happy to support anyone who takes that route to be comfortable in their gender, but it's just not for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I would dearly like to do, though, is get rid of my breasts. They are annoying, inconvenient, uncomfortable, and quite frankly, useless. I'm asexual and aromantic (autochorissexual, to be exact), so it's not like I have (or want) anyone else interested in them. I got to thinking about that the other day, thanks to the aforementioned comment to my mom. I'd just gotten home from work on a blisteringly hot, muggy day, took off my bra and changed into house-clothes, and realized just how \*much\* my breasts bother me. I told mom that, if I could, I'd just get rid of 'em altogether just so I wouldn't have to deal with 'em anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

And once I got to thinking about it, there are really only two things that keep me from doing it: The cost, and... well, my nipples. They're sensitive enough that they tend to be a big part of 'alone time'; I do \*not\* want to lose that, but don't know if surgery would affect them. (I am unhappy enough with having lady parts that, quite frankly, I need all the help I can get.)

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't have the first clue where to start researching something like that, though, or if I'd ever go through with it. I know I'd have support from my family if I did, so it comes down to a personal choice. I dunno. Just that random comment had all this running around in my head, and I needed to write it out, I guess.

My boyfriend and I went to the beach yesterday with some friends and we encountered a pretty intamate issue while in the ocean.

We weren't binding because with our combined rib problems, the 30 degree heat and I don't want it to degrade because I can't get another one. I managed to convince our friends to go to a beach with a minimal amount of people and we wore the baggiest shirts in my BF's wardrobe so we were relatively safe.

I think what must have happened was the loose clothing rubbed up against our chests while we were swimming, the added salt creating some friction, because after about ten minutes our nipples were in near agony and it only got worse the whole time we swam.

The problem actually got worse about an hour after we got home from the beach and we realised that actually there were little tiny cuts on our nips that weren't there before and they'd been irritated to the point where they were open and red. It was painful 100% of the time and near impossible to shower.

We both have quite sensitive skin which can't have helped. A friend had the same issue last year but he just took off his shirt and it went away but we obviously can't do that.

Has anyone experienced this? 

I thought about putting little plasters or tape over the area but again, I'm not sure if that would help. I'm not sure if a binder wouldn't just make it worse. And like I said, I couldn't afford another one if the ocean ruined it.

I decided to shoot my ex a message about it because I didn't want him to hear it through someone else. There weren't many hard feelings post break up so I didn't want this to be the start of him overthinking anything. He was extremely accepting of it, even said he suspected it while we were dating which was funny and kinda affirming to me in an odd way, but it was really nice. We decided to be friends again, since it's been a year and we're both in much better places than we were when we broke up. He immediately started calling me by my preferred name and pronouns, slipping up only rarely and apologizing/correcting himself when it happened. It's been nearly a week since I came out to him and he's been the sweetest, most compassionate and lovely person about it.

It's made me feel extremely happy and accepted. I haven't felt this at peace in a long time and I'm really looking forward to beginning some superficial physical transitions soon!!

I am not sure if any of you are familiar with this theory, but I feel that it is very applicable to the idea of transitioning, as long as you disregard some of Rogers more...problematic early attitudes towards homosexuality (he thought it was a form of neurosis). 

According to this theory a person has two ""selfs."" One is the ""actual self,"" and this is the version of themselves that they present to the world. The other is the ""ideal self,"" which is the version of themselves they have in their mind. The further apart these two selves are, the more incongruence the individual will experience. The incongruence they feel leads to neurosis like anxiety, depression and, in the case of as trans person, gender dysphoria. 

The principal goal of any individual is to achieve congruence, a state in which these selfs are in alignment, a process which Rogers refers to as self-actualization. According to Rogers it is impossible to achieve true congruence, but you can get very close, at which point it is a process that goes on throughout your life as your actual self and your ideal self change and grow, and that the best way to help with this process is with the aid of another congruent person, especially if you are in a severe state of incongruence.

So a little nearly 3 years ago I made the second biggest mistake of my life, I came out as Bi to my parents. They claimed they accepted me but in hindsight they started treating me significantly worse. About 7 months later, still thinking they accepted me, I made what is the single bigger mistake of my life - I told them something at the time only 2 other people knew. I told them that I am MTF transgender. I got grounded for a week and they went through my phone, deleted anything remotely feminine, and would only give it back if I agreed to let them go through whenever they want (which they still use more often than I can explain, but now I hide everything and they haven’t found anything). When I finally got my own car about 1 year ago, they installed a tracking app on my phone that gives my Mom (they worse of the 2) a notification when I enter/leave a 2 km (about 1 mile) radius of home, whenever I exceed 50km per hour (about 31 mph), and they can look at a live map of where I am at anytime and how fast I’m moving. They also threw out all my traditionally feminine clothing (and wigs, make-up, and anything that had my preferred name on it) and grounded me for another month about a year ago when they found it all after of keeping it hidden for 18 months).

There’s a lot more that they do but that’s the important stuff. I’ve been dealing with a lot of Dysphoria recently and there’s no real way to secretly wear and dress what I want and even just doing something as small as shaving my armpits last month got my phone taken away for a day.

2019-07-27 02:16:02,cibxbd,2,1,"I was born female, and when I was nine I became very jealous of the boys and I envied them, I can't explain why, but that's how I thought. I started getting extremely uncomfortable with my body, and I have an older sister, so I had an idea of what my body was going to look like once I started developing. I would watch how the boys around me would act and I would try to be like them. From the way I talked, looked, etc. From there it got worse. When I turned 10, I got my hair cut really short and I was extremely happy. I felt like one of the boys, and looked like a boy (I don't have a very feminine looking face to begin with). I moved and attended a new school. Once I arrived to my new class, all my classmates thought I was a guy. I felt confident. But they found out I wasn't a boy and I got anxious. (I have bad social anxiety as well, my mom is the cause of it but that's another story). I also started hitting puberty at this time. I was so uncomfortable with my chest that I wore big men's hoodies all the time, everyday, even in the summer. It started getting bad there. I honestly did not shower a lot because I hated looking at my body. When I was 12, I said goodbye to primary/elementary school and hopped over to middle school. It all continued mostly the same, but having to go into the girl's changing room and all that really ate me alive. All of my friends were guys and I hated that I was always seperated from them and put into things for girls. Anyway, one day, a friend of mine came up to me and asked me - ""Are you transgender?"" and I said ""What is that?"". He said to me - ""If you're transgender, it means you were born one gender and really want to be another one"". I scoffed and said no, but I needed to know more about this. I knew I felt this way and I wanted an explanation as to why I did feel that way and how I could change it. I didn't do too much research, but I did enough. While I did that, I found out that being transgender is a pretty contreversial thing and a lot of people were against it. Esentially it seemed pretty taboo. After a while of thinking, I came to the conclusion that I was transgender. But I was scared to say anything. Extremely afraid. I told a terrible old friend of mine and she belittled me a lot about it. I remember this one thing she said - ""You were born a girl. Fucking act like one. Maybe if you put makeup on and acted like a girl, you wouldn't feel that way."" I went home and had a really bad anxiety attack. So, I started wearing makeup, and a lot of it. I did get made fun of for presenting more as a boy by a lot of classmates and even my mom as it was, so I tried really hard to act feminine. It destroyed me, and I can't explain why I did it, but I did. I got a really positive reaction from it, and maybe I should've been happy that way, but I wasn't. Maybe my friend was wrong. I felt disgusting but people weren't questioning me/making fun of me anymore. I tried to kill myself that summer. I started cutting my body up a lot and even burning myself. It didn't work, and I didn't tell anyone at the time. A while later, I had very, very bad suicidal thoughts and CONSTANT anxiety attacks for about 3 months straight. Even thinking about it scares me and that occured years ago. After time passed, I went back to being myself and presenting how I wanted to. I was happy. Eventually, I came out as transgender to the person who has been the love of my life since I was 7. She was extremely supportive and I felt amazing. Then I came out to my friends, their reactions were mostly positive. A few people said I was an attention seeker and stuff like that, but I was euphoric and didn't care. And the shit starts here. I came out to my mother. She said ""*My birth name* I will always support you. If it makes you happy, be who you are. You are my kid. I will always love you."" I cried. I was so happy. It was all working out. I wanted to get my hair cut again and get more clothes from the mens section. Then, after a while of me coming out... say 2 months later? I asked my mom to slowly try calling me my preferred name and using he/him pronouns. She laughed in my face and rolled her eyes, saying 'Yeah, okay, sure' in a extremely sarcastic voice. My heart sank. The name I chose (with the help of my amazing friends) was Tobias. I asked her to call me that. A few times a week, she would call me my name in a super mean way and laugh at me. She told me I was just doing it all for attention. All the hope I had in the situation left me, I felt like I had nothing as time went on. My depression (which has been with me since I can remember), was getting worse. Then I told all of my friends that ""I'm not transgender, I was jist depressed"". Which wasn't true, I just didn't want my mom to go off on me anymore. Some of my friends supported me, and my other 'friends' told me I was an attention whore. I went back to presenting female. I was sick everyday, I ate way way less, I rarely had a shower, I avoided everyone and was mean to everyone, and I slept all day. Everyday. Eventually, I ended up trying to take my life again. I wrote a letter and at the top I wrote, and I quote - ""MOM THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. YOU BITCH YOU RUINED ME I FUCKING HATE YOU."" She worked the night shift sometimes and she was at work the time I attempted. She never found out about it. The note, everything. I woke up the next morning and threw up. I felt so sick and fucking furious. I got better though. Then I started presenting as a boy. My therapists and everything did not believe I was transgender even after months and months of explaining and ranting to them about it which made me feel terrible because I wasn't getting help (It's still the same. They take it as a joke.) I came out as trans again a year later. I told my mom I would not listen to her shit and that I would not respond to her if she made fun of me or called me my birthname. So many people called me an attention whore, a ""transtrender"", etc, without  knowing any details of the story. But a few people supported me. Same thing happened as the first time with my mom making fun of me for it. But it was worse this time. Being called an attention whore, a fake bitch and a ""transtrender"" started to get to me. And a guy I really liked felt the same back. It all hit me and I said the same thing as the first time - 'I'm just depressed I'm not trans'. I started cutting so bad and started making myself throw up and planned my suicide. I was put into the mental health part of the hospital and had to stay there for a while, but I didn't get any help. I've been out for a while now. I'm still really struggling with it. And I love my boyfriend, but he's the type of person that 'supports' me but tries to guilt trip me out of transitioning, but only for his benefit. I'm still presenting as a girl. I know I don't have to, but it keeps people happy. Other than me. Please help me, someone, anyone. I would give my soul away not to feel this. 

Also, I'm much happier and my depression is pretty well gone (other than the trans thing). I moved out from my mom and I live with my amazing Dad.

From a very young age I had issues with accepting who I was. I was always a difficult child to deal with, wanting to do the opposite of what I thought was right. I had a love for breaking the rules and doing what was “wrong”. 

Later in life when I discovered what sexuality was, I stuck to my old ways and wanted to break those norms I had built up in my head. Men are to be with women, and that’s that. I started to experiment and thought homosexuality wasn’t for me. However I kept finding myself being interested in the male form. I’d feel disgusted at myself for even thinking about it. This led me down years of self hatred and mental issues I still have not gotten over. 

After a short time in counseling, I had come to terms with myself that I could be bisexual. Being happy with myself I continued on with my life. 

Without going into too much detail, I found myself being curious about the sexual nature of the male form and learned to explore myself in other ways. That led me to realizing I had a cross dressing fetish. 

While strictly for sexual purposes, I would dress up and do makeup to please myself or partners, to sort of “fit the part” of a bottom better. 

After awhile I started dating my current girlfriend of 5 years. I hung up my clothes and began starting a heterosexual relationship. I introduced her to my habits and the collection of toys I’d acquired over the years didn’t set her off, but my collection of women’s clothes was a bit odd to her. We eventually moved beyond that and It was no longer weird, but wasn’t something we would utilize on a regular basis. 

Most recently, I started to notice I had moments where I would do something considered feminine. I’d started growing out my hair about two years ago, and I’d style it in ways that were very feminine(at least to me). 

I started questioning wether or not I could be a trans woman, when all of the sudden I got hit in the face with the most amount of self hatred mixed with depression I had ever experienced. I would only experience these feelings when I was aroused, but would quickly dissipate to hatred when I wasn’t, the same way I felt when I was questioning my sexuality. 

That was a few months ago now and I’ve done a lot of soul searching. Using some of the techniques utilized in therapy, I was able to clear my mind and see what I really wanted for myself. I’m proud to say that I will soon be working on the steps to become the best woman I can. While there will be a lot of troubles along the way, I know inside this is the path I need to take.

That led me to realizing I had a cross dressing fetish. \n\nWhile strictly for sexual purposes, I would dress up and do makeup to please myself or partners, to sort of “fit the part” of a bottom better. \n\nAfter awhile I started dating my current girlfriend of 5 years. I hung up my clothes and began starting a heterosexual relationship. I introduced her to my habits and the collection of toys I’d acquired over the years didn’t set her off, but my collection of women’s clothes was a bit odd to her. We eventually moved beyond that and It was no longer weird, but wasn’t something we would utilize on a regular basis. \n\nMost recently, I started to notice I had moments where I would do something considered feminine. I’d started growing out my hair about two years ago, and I’d style it in ways that were very feminine(at least to me). \n\nI started questioning wether or not I could be a trans woman, when all of the sudden I got hit in the face with the most amount of self hatred mixed with depression I had ever experienced. I would only experience these feelings when I was aroused, but would quickly dissipate to hatred when I wasn’t, the same way I felt when I was questioning my sexuality. \n\nThat was a few months ago now and I’ve done a lot of soul searching. Using some of the techniques utilized in therapy, I was able to clear my mind and see what I really wanted for myself. I’m proud to say that I will soon be working on the steps to become the best woman I can. While there will be a lot of troubles along the way, I know inside this is the path I need to take. \n\nThe moral of all of this is pretty much,\nLook inside and find what you truly want, and don’t let anyone stop you.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Finally accepting myself.', 'created': 1564227974.0}"

Wear men's™️ deodorant and use men's™️ body wash!!! I've always used typical feminine smelling stuff because I was terrified of being outted before I was ready, but I can't wait to start smelling like a man that way!!!

Get my hair cut short!!! I've always overcompensate by having really, really long hair. It's been such a nuisance my whole life and oh my god, I cannot wait to chop it all off and see what I look like with a short man's™️ cut!!! I have no clue what style I'm gonna go for but deciding has been fun so far!!!

Getting a binder eventually/soon!!! I've never experienced very much gender dysphoria, but what I have experienced has been centered around my breasts. I'm definitely going to get top surgery in the future, but for now I can't wait to start wearing a binder instead of a bra!!! 

Having sex with someone who uses correctly gendered terms for me and my body parts! I won't go into detail obviously but I have an amazingly understanding and compassionate life partner who's as excited as I am to explore and realize what I like to hear in bed! 

I'm not ready to start talking to doctors about T or surgeries or anything like that yet, but oh my god am I so super excited to start doing the little things. It's gonna make my life so much happier and special and comfortable!!!! 😭💙💙🤩

There are a lot of things that both the anti-LGBT and pro-LGBT sides do that make no sense, at all. I'm going to mention them here, because it honestly REALLY bothers me. -=WARNING=-

Okay, so I've noticed something: hypocrisy. For example: if we can have our pride flags, why cant straight people? Remember, they probably see our pride flags the same way we do theirs. So, once again, why can't they have pride flags too? Straight does not mean TERF.

Transphobes don't bother me, simply because I ignore them, and I don't let them. Sometimes, I laugh at ""offensive"" gay jokes. I deal with problems with horrendous black humour, and I get called a TERF and a truscum, but aren't trans memes very similar? It makes no sense to me, why can't others accept each other? It makes no fucking sense. I know I'm not above others, but why do other people not know that? This ""gender war"" is literally a bunch of idiots yelling ""My gender is better than yours!"" at each other, from both sides! I guess it's human nature, but still. I understand the ""fighting for our rights"" (in quotations because IDK what to use to quote something other than that), but at the same time, thats what they think too! TERFs see it the same way. I don't mean to be transphobic, but this is a problem I've noticed, and I though I'd mention it because of the fact that, to be honest, I don't like the way this community acts. I also don't like how the ""TERF communities"" (i mean, what else do i call them, i really don't know) act either. I don't like this community, or the TERF communities, tbh.

After thinking about it a little more though, I realized that it's probably something that I'd want to do at some point, though I'm still kinda afraid of it. Is that normal as well?

2019-07-29 17:16:15,cje8mr,5,3,"Hey everybody, cishet dude here, and I need a little insight.

Let’s talk about my friend first, who I’ll be calling Charlie. Now I’ve known this tomboyish girl since elementary school, and have been best friends with her since high school.  We share a lot of similar interests in anime, games, art, and comics, and I always hang out at her house, especially during summer break (we went to different high schools).  It wasn’t until half-a-year-ago that she came out to me as a transgender male, and honestly, I’m surprised I didn’t realize it sooner!  Our friendship hasn’t changed at all, and we’re hanging out more than ever thanks to being high school graduates now.  His parents are out-of-country right now, and they are half-supportive-half-concerned about him transitioning.  For one, his parents have known about his coming out since early middle school (6 years or so), and some personal conceptions or experiences have had them believe it was “just a phase.”  Well, it really ain’t a phase anymore!  Until they permanently return to the country in a year or so, Charlie is going to have to wait even longer on possibly beginning his transition.  He has been having counseling, at the very least, supporting their gender identity and transition.
A semi-important point is that I live fairly close to a popular urban city in the Southeastern U.S. that’s very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, and the university Charlie and I are attending is for it as well.

Now, the obstacle isn’t me facing the truth about Charlie, never has been and probably never will be.  It’s me facing my PARENTS facing the truth about Charlie. Now let’s talk about them.  
For their age, I think my parents are on the line between being conservative or progressive, and the local community may have had an impact on their conceptions of LGBTQ+ in recent years.  My father is seemingly much more laid back about progressive topics; maybe he’s an “out of sight, out of mind” kind of person, as I can’t recall any encounters between him and LGBTQ+ people.  If anything, he’s more concerned that the friends I’m with are safe and responsible (which Charlie pretty much is), and that I myself am making responsible decisions and working hard.  My mother is slightly less laid back, and if anything, they’re curious about it.  She seems to be a partially devout Catholic (doesn’t have a lot of time to attend church services, so she makes up through social media posting about her faith and family). One time, my mom asked me if I should try dating a bi girl I knew, and I told her that she had a girlfriend at that time. Iirc, she didn’t say much, but she thankfully didn’t make any weird critiques or statements on me or my choice of friends.

It can be seen that my parents don’t agree nor disagree with the idea of LGBTQ+ people, but what would happen if I try to change their conception of one person that they never knew was transgender?  Whenever I mention Charlie, I have to get in the mindset of talking about “Charlotte,” and repeating that dead name ends up leaving me confused sometimes and accidentally using it when talking to Charlie. Hell, I have to do it when talking to Charlie’s parents, since they’re still iffy on supporting his transition.  It sucks having to talk/text the parents about “Charlotte” and not Charlie.
If I tell them the truth, what should I do if they press me for further questioning, or try to contact his parents if they are supportive about it? Despite me being somewhat independent, would they try to have their word on who I should/shouldn’t be friends with? It’s those “what-ifs” that concern me.

Now, the easiest solution would seem to be to simply not tell my parents the truth.  Out of sight, out of mind, right?  Not really.  Charlie and I are going to stick together through college and probably our adult lives as well, and beating around the bush and lying to my parents isn’t really going to help. It’s just going to make the eventual revelation harder to understand (unless I somehow take this all to my grave?)

Another solution would be saying something like “there’s something I have to tell you guys” and sitting them down to talk about my friend coming out would probably make them think that *I* am the one coming out, and cause further confusion. 

Reflecting on it, I am very nonchalant about Charlie’s coming out.  If I have that same kind of attitude when telling my parents, would they be nonchalant about it as well? 
“Hey! so charlotte is actually a guy, he’s charlie! ok talk to you later love ya” 
(...okay maybe that’s too casual).  But basically, could treating it like it’s not a big deal work?

2019-07-30 02:56:52,cjloid,1,0,"Hi all! My name is Amelia, I'm a 20 year old MtF and about 2 months into my transition. I've been having an itch to tell the story of the time I came out to my extended family and how my mother really made things difficult in the long-run, I figured I would just dump it on r/trans to open a wider discussion on the topic. This may get a bit long as it requires some backstory, so grab some popcorn! 

TL;DR: years of refusing to use my pronouns lead to my mum telling my family to call me by a name that she chose rather than the one I chose.

I initially came out to my parents when I was 16, I had always had underlying feelings of being trans but at the same time I was still unbelievably scared and confused as to what was going through my head. My mum and I have always had a fairly good relationship so I trusted her enough to admit what I was going feeling and thinking. I told her about what gender dysphoria was and that I wanted to start transitioning into a woman. This was met with... mixed reactions, on one hand she was trying her utmost feign support for me, but even I could seen under the facade of smiles and sweetness she was freaking out about the entire thing, she give me the usual lines that I'm sure you've all heard, ""But you like boy things so much."" ""Why cant you just be a feminine guy?"" etc. This affected me pretty badly as I was still struggling with my own emotions alone, now I was dealing with her insecurity on the matter. Eventually after a bad run in with a very judgemental therapist, I forced my way back into the closet and we went on pretending like this had never happened.

Flash forward to November of 2018 and my desire to transition came back HARD. I mean like harder than ever before. fell into a pretty deep depression for about a month, finally coming to the conclusion that I'm never going to be happy unless I bite the bullet and just start hrt. I pulled my mum aside and told her what was going to happen, again she was hesitant but less so this time. She said she would try and support me through the whole thing, ironically following up with some classic ""I'm going to lose my son"" lines. These didn't work, however. I had chosen once and for all that this was my path and I'd be damned if someone was going to stop me now.

For the most part I was extremely excited about the future. My parents were on board with my decision, albeit reluctantly. and I was making progress, slowly. The most important thing to me at the beginning was coming out to everyone else. how I was going to do it and who I wanted to tell first. Our family is pretty big so I decided to tell people in smaller groups. The opportunity arose when my grandparents, aunt, uncle and two kids were planning on coming over for dinner, I stupidly told mum about my plan but I was still hesitant after she basically forced me to come out to my brother out of desperation and the fact she thought I was lying to him by doing this, this was mistake number one.

As dinner finished up we all moved to the living room, this was it, now or never, time to finally come out with it. I managed to utter out that I need to talk, and just got right into it. I admitted my feelings and told them of my plan to transition. I also made it clear that this shouldn't be taboo or a dirty secret, that who I am isn't a page in the dirt sheets that they dare not talk about, as long as they are respectful I am happy to be open or answer any questions. For the most part it went as smooth as you could ask for, there was a lot of confusion, a lot of support and a lot more questions! This is when the subject of pronouns got brought up, things started to go downhill from here.

Now an important note here and one of the worst things about my dealing with my family is that they have decided they dont want to use my pronouns or call my by my preferred name. I was essentially a bystander in a decision about my own pronouns which frustrates me a lot, especially when it comes to my brother. He will call me things like 'bro' or 'man' and when I tell him to stop he responds with ""Well you ARE my brother, arent you?"" or ""That's just what you are"" which is extremely transphobic if you ask me.

So, back to the discussion, my aunt asked me ""What are we supposed to call you now?"" and before I can even answer, my mum says ""Oh we're not using (deadname)'s pronouns just yet, it's too confusing and we want to wait."" Which just left me speechless, the absolute AUDACITY to answer for me, especially on something I feel so strongly about, it's like she thinks that my pronouns are a group decision for everyone involved to vote on. She continued: ""As for names I was thinking something like Kira would suit him."" Now personally, I hate the name Kira for myself (No disrespect to any Kiras out there, it's just not for me!) It's far too close to my deadname for me to even consider. I responded by saying that I'm still deciding on a name but I'm fond of the name Amelia, to which my mum responds ""Nonsense, I'm your mother and I get a say in what your name is!"" I believe this was bordering on a joke but I could feel the genuine energy when she said it, the whole thing was insulting nonetheless.  


At this point, I was frustrated but it wasn't the end of the world, I could still  convince everyone to use my pronouns eventually. This was when my grandma came into the room, looked at me and said ""Would you like a drink, Kira?"" Internally I was screaming. My mother basically just declared my name and now people were using it, I dont blame my grandmother, she was still wrapping her head around the whole thing so it wasn't her fault. Eventually as everyone left I just sat there in dumbfounded thought. My mum had hijacked the conversation, told everyone without my permission to just forget about using my pronouns and was now chatting to me like nothing had happened. 

Later down the line I came out to plenty of other people but every time my mum has been there and she has tried the same trick every time I've tried to stop her but it doesn't seem to be working. Now my entire family arent even bothering with pronouns, making it really difficult when I just want to be Amelia, not Kira, not deadname, only who I am meant to be. I know it isn't the end of the world and in the broader sense I'm very lucky to have parents that are even trying to support me in the first place. even if it is very rocky support.

So I know how it can be misinterpreted because I have a lot of times talk with people from many horizons and with different orientations. And they can get hurt easily when we don't understand right away and use the bad name, gender etc. 

Getting at my questions. 

- doing the body transformation makes you feel better and your true self ? Isn't it hard sometimes still ? I have been told that mentally people wanting to go under those changements already feel like and are like opposite sex. So the body is the one thing that isn't ""right"". Some even told me that they would have like to be born as a girl. Because in their mind they have the girl thinking.

- would it be normal for a male to love a transgender person ? The penis is still here. But the physic except that, is more looking to a woman. Depending of course of how good it has been done...

2019-07-31 12:53:20,ck84b6,1,4,"So... a bit of info before 20yo MtF

I came out to my parents about 2 months ago, this is something ive had on the back of my mind for around 6 years but only have thought about it seriously after i ended my relationship with my previous partner last october.

I started with my mom since my dad is not at home for the majority of the day. At first she said that she had been ""suspecting"" something for a while and was trying to find out my opinion on trans people. She didnt really know how to react and she said that she loved me no matter what. 

After that she said some stuff that made me realize that she really didnt have a clue about what was going on. She was concerned about her ""son"" being a completely different person, i tried to convince her that im not a different person, that im the ""son"" that she knows, im just not comfortable in my body, the way people refer to me and not being able to do stuff commonly associated with being feminine.

Still she didnt get it and asked me very insistently about why and when as if she didnt believe this ""son"" of her was actually a woman. I got really offended by her not believing me and being questioned about it as if it was a crime. After that i acted really cold towards her for a couple of days and she was trying to research about trans people, she got to the conclusion tht i was getting depressed because of being trans and got really worried about me hurting myself, i got even more offended and was very angry at her for a while, it got to the point that my dad had to speak to me about it.

Turns out my mom told him literally right after i told her without consulting me. My dad is an artist and knows quite some people that are lgbt, I thought he was gonna be more wise about this but it didnt turn out very well. 

For context i live in the northern region of México and theres still a lot of backlash against lgbt people. He was trying to make me ""change my mind"", as if this was something i chose to be, all this because he knows ""how miserable"" these people are and how they, at least in the art environment where he works,  just try to distract themselves with work so they dont have to think about their pain.

He said some very hurtful stuff and and questioned me much more harshly because he ""knows me"", i was just wishing i had never told them and then he told me that the only important thing i needed to take from that conversation is that i was making my mom suffer because the only thing she has always been proud of was her ""son"" and now ""he"" turned out like this.

Basically im being forced to be in the closet until i leave the house and im literally prohibited from being overly feminine.

3 days ago my family came back from a vacation trip, a trip i didnt want to go, i used all that time to be as girly as i wanted, i wore my first dress, i wore make up for the first time and so, i was so happy being finally able to be what i wanted to and now i have to pretend to be a boy again.

2019-07-31 22:00:50,ckf5lv,0,1,"Hi all!

As you all know coming out is not exactly a piece of cake..
I know my mom is semi supportive (saying that as I'm not exactly sure where I have her, she might be very supportive!)
My father is not so..
Now they are not together anymore, so at least I can tell them one by one.

Also another issue here is that I live by myself in a different country and I don't want to do it over the phone/text or video chat.

But once my mom is here I wish to tell her.

Is there any good way to transition over to the topic and to maybe probe and see what she thinks of it before I come out?

Any tips would be greatly appreciated
