Everyone loves to believe in the idea that they are always available to you. Well, I can tell you that in terms of finding a doctor in Greece I have exhausted my options. There's always inhousepharmacy right? 

""Hello Paige

Two things:


Echeck is only for US customers resident in the US - the US based cheque verifiers will call to verify the order with the account holder. If you are not in the US to take their call,  Echeck will not accept the order.


We do not ship to Greece.""

Well I guess I could order to my private mailbox back in the US, and pay with echeck... sinc eI only have a mastercard except... they call to verify. I could even arrange to answer said call, and arrange to have my mom mail them to me here in Greece but it's just not practical; it's my only option.

It's too late now, I'm already miserable and pissed off and the most logical thing for me to do at this point is ride it out. I've gone from having a shot every week to nothing and I'm about a month or so into withdrawl. 

I can't help but think I never should have started in the first place. Sure I guess if you're going to always live in a place that has them then who cares? I really want to believe that even in a place with good resources, that things can always change for the worst. It sucks to go through this, so bad.

I sent around 0.22BTC to a place called ""Kiwi Drug"" and I've been ignored ever since I sent the payment, go figure. 

Asides from being very costly, and a restrictive life choice that confines you to a place (which may not be a great place but has the support you need) there's always ""what are the long term effects, quality of the medications that you're obtaining, etc.""

Once a doctor told me that blood level work was nearly entirely subjective with the exception of liver function; I don't trust doctors not to nickel and dime me for all they can so if anybody wants to cross link to clear this up that would be nice. There's a lot to know, and nobody wants to spend money that they don't need to spend. I still don't understand this, and I can't really justify paying for hormones anymore if I need bloodwork that I don't understand otherwise I'd be a hypocrite.

Also another thing that bothers me is that it can't just be as simple as ""this is what I want"" rather I am regarded as mentally ill. With the way it seems to have become common place to criminalize the mentally ill, maybe not worth it?


What I mean by that is... what if I could be whoever I wanted to be and be happy with myself... hormones are definitely nice they make me look better but I guess before I started them I wasn't able to appreciate what it means to know that you are who you are, inside and to be at peace with that...
