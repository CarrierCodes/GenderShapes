2014-10-02 01:36:27,2i1tqd,15,12,"I've been bashing my head against this subject for about two weeks now, and I've finally come to the point where I just don't know what's up or down.

I need help

I'm an 18 year-old male (term used loosely here) interested in females. I had a plenty boyish childhood. Batman, power rangers, vidya games, etc. According to my parents, I never exhibited any signs of transsexuality except for one whole summer where I wore nothing but a pink dress (I was riding that hype train HARD.) I don't really remember if I held any notable interests in girl toys; I vaguely recall /wanting/ to play with my sister's barbie house, but I definitely don't remember it materializing into anything. Nothing really significant that I remember, basically. 

Growing up, I was pretty feminine, though. I didn't like sports or have any real desire to play them despite my dad's persistent encouragement to do so. I didn't like the idea of being strong, masculine, or really anything that might result in such. It absolutely repulses me now. Probably the most notable of my friendships growing up were my two female friends, not that I could make any other friends anyway. Now that I think of it, I don't think I've ever intentionally befriended a male. And even if I did, the very act of inviting them over seemed hellish. I felt like I didn't know what to do or what they'd want to do, so I generally avoided stuff like that. I did like hanging out in groups, though; the reason, I imagine, is that I could just play along until I could leave without insulting the host. I never had that problem with girls, though. 

I wouldn't say I developed a conscious desire to be female until about age 15 or 16. I began fantasizing about the idea of being a female, which always took me away from my studies, social interactions, and generally occupied my mind more than anything else. I had a lot of sexual fantasies as a female in a heterosexual relationship. I had a lot of fantasies which consisted of just /being female/. It got to the point where I would actually crack a smile as if it provided me with some sort of elation. I thought a lot about waking up in a world where I was female and had always been so, which, invariably, seemed worlds better than living as a male.

I'd just take all of that (as well as some other stuff I'm not going to mention here) as 'good enough' evidence for being transsexual, but I'm having trouble with one thing.

The Dysphoria.

I can't say I've ever experienced what a lot of transsexuals have purportedly experienced at the level they have. I've never really liked having a penis (erections suck, especially because I naturally sit to pee), but it hasn't been until recently that I've seen it as *vaguely* foreign. I've had the same issue with my chest, too. I haven't really had an issue with not having breasts until, just a few weeks ago, I lifted up my arms to stretch after showering, noticed my chest, and could just see breasts. I stayed like that, frozen, for about a minute, just looking. I couldn't wrap my head around it. Ever since, I can't stop noticing that my genitals seem like they're separate from the rest of my body and that I /should/ have breasts. Body hair, too, hasn't been an issue at all, and I'd be hard pressed to say that it's a real issue now. I did a full-body shave recently and just LOVE smoothness. I have zero desire to go back to not trimming body hair, but, then again, I think I /could/ live with not shaving religiously in a world where I don't transition.

My main concern coming out of this is what if I'm just tricking myself into thinking I'm trans? I really, really do want to be a woman. That is something I'm confident in saying. I at least /think/ I want breasts, a vagina, a smaller waist, wider hips, longer hair, etc. But what if the slight physical dysphoria is all manufactured out of my head and is just validating some transtrender mentality? I pose a lot in front of the mirror, expecting to find curvier physique, plumper lips, longer hair that I could style, etc. but is that necessarily transsexualism? Am I just a really, really feminine man? Note: I never do that kind of stuff out in public. I rarely talk in a feminine voice, walk in a feminine way (I kind of tend to swing my ass), any of that stuff when around my heterocissexual friends. I just get really scared of what they'll think.

Sorry that this is probably so shitty and poorly worded/written. I probably left out a lot of important details. I have really poor organizational abilities and get a little too lazy to spend more than an hour writing.

Please help. I'll be trying on my first dress tomorrow. (haven't had the opportunity since I really decided to begin the early stages of my transtion, I moved away from my house and don't have access to women's clothing.)

2014-10-27 20:05:54,2khut9,8,4,"Hi,

I'm standing for the Green Party over in the /r/MHoC General Election, in the West Midlands area, I'm the only transgender candidate this Election and could really use some help getting in, I'm currently the Equalities Spokesgirl for the Green Party and I'm trying to make a push to correct several flaws in the Equalities Act.

I can't tell you which region to vote in, but I'm standing in the West Midlands, but if you are voting somewhere else, please vote Green, there's a chance of us getting some national seats, so I still might be able to get in.
