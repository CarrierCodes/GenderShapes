2014-05-07 17:21:19,24ysz9,6,9,"Hello everyone... 

This is my first ever post, I'm 29 Genderqueer MTF. I've been a bit timid to do much yet. I am starting to slowly explore clothing and make up. I've spoken with my parents, told a very small selection of friends.... including my handsome roommate (who is over my shoulder telling me to add that right now). It's been a very depressing couple of weeks. 

After the huge buzz of figuring a part of myself was missing. I did get to feel pretty, female friends I told accepted me. Although I lost one close friend. Not for saying that I was trans, but because our relationship became too complicated sexually, but her support is very very missed. 

No one else knows, my facebook world doesn't. I posted this comic http://www.dumpaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/women-stripping-funny.jpg for a little context, I had been a burlesque performer and male stripper myself in the past. 

I instantly got jumped up and down upon by a person I have not met in real life. I was verbally attacked for being sexist, misogynistic and perpetuating issues of the male gaze, the down trodden nature the patriarchal society creates. I tried to explain that this comic is funny out of its reductive truth, there has been an evolution/de-evolution in society. I tried to justify expressing this side of my sense of humour without outing myself. 

But I felt destroyed as a male and questioned my acceptance as a possible female. I have since had nightmares being attacked by women. I discussed later with this same feminist about the their attitude to other women including black women, and LGBT. Lesbians seem to be accepted, everything else she stated as ""watering down the issue"", and ""they have their own groups for that"".

I've never been violent, aggressive or dominant. And have actually hated men myself for those very reasons. I had to move from a small rural area because I could not find a place or acceptance. Now I live in Melbourne, a capital city. I got into performance, and for the longest time got to express myself enough that I felt comfortable with myself. But I was secretly unhappy, conflicted and felt worthless I drank to numb anxiety. I got to perform in drag in a couple of burlesque shows and LOVED IT. Now I don't want to live artificial or heightened anymore. I want be me, fulltime, normal, real. But now that I've run up against females I thought were friends. Females posting very anti-male statements that I tried to call for some temperance on... only to be deleted. University friends stating some very firm men cause the problem statements, including one female friend I quite liked and am now scared of. I don't fear men when I come out, I've dealt my whole childhood not being accepted by men, so fuck that. I felt safe with women, I trusted women, I looked up to women for achieving and giving, but now?

Now I feel really uncomfortable with women and men. I hate me for being male and not being right in my body, and I'm scared of women for not accepting me as trans or as a woman, or hating both parts of me. The male me... the female me that doesn't think like them.

Yes these are huge psychological issues, I'm seeing a psychiatrist, I'm in an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Group. But I have no Trans or Genderqueer people to ask. 

I have decided to deactivate Facebook for now, it makes me angry that people are so maligned against each other. For gods sake we just want to be accepted by one another.

What do I do? Is it going to get easier? I've had a lesbian friend who when I came out to her told me I should do drag instead of transitioning. But I don't want to be accepted as a curio? A parody of a woman, a caricature? 

I'm feeling very alone. I've got a world of other questions, about hormones, therapy, clothes, make up, androgyne status. But right now I just want to know things can be ok. And that the little boy that felt he should be a girl isn't going to be put through the ringer...
