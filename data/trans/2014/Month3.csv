2014-03-06 02:05:31,1zokwh,4,9,"A few questions for /r/trans -

I saw [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/03/02/internet-consensus-degeneres-liza-minnelli-joke-mean-transphobic/) the other day and can't seem to stop thinking about it. I wanted to reach out to folks for additional perspectives, comments, insights, etc. to see if I could come to a better understanding of the issues at hand.

I have started to form some of my own opinions about the issues, but as someone who is cisgender, there are surely things in my blind spot I'm not even aware that I'm not considering because trying to put myself in someone else's shoes has its limits. Needless to say, I've been thinking about lots of aspects of this debate. Here's sort of what I have thought about so far and some of the questions that are coming to mind:

1. It seemed Ellen's comments were a joke about drag queens and Liza Minnelli being someone who is often impersonated by them. I know of people who became popular as drag queens and later came out as trans, but my understanding is that most drag queens identify as men, even while in drag. If that's true, then it seems like it would be much more offensive that people (news media?) are conflating drag queens with people who identify as trans, than Ellen addressing Liza Minnelli as ""sir."" Is there something I'm not considering here?

2. When I checked out the petition going around, I assumed it would contain commentary detailing Ellen's offense and explaining why it was a transphobic statement. I checked out the comments and it seemed like most people were offended that a joke was made at the expense of an EGOT winner! That Liza Minnelli should be regarded as untouchable. (E.g. ""Do the right thing, Ellen, tell Liza you are sorry, respect her great contributions to our culture -- she's earned an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony Award! Rare club! Apologize to Liza! 'Be kind.'"") Few, if any, comments mentioned transphobia at all.

3. On some sites' comment sections, a lot of comments started with ""I'm gay..."", and continued, ""...and the joke was fine! People need to stop being so sensitive."" I have an issue with people's legitimate reactions to events they feel are oppressive being shushed with accusations of being oversensitive. I think lots of people have, in their own way, felt offended by something and then faced accusations of being overly sensitive which is really frustrating, disrespectful, and dehumanizing. I think that all LGBTQ folks have some shared experience of being a minority, but that there are lots of areas where trans issues don't overlap with lesbian and gay (and/or bisexual) issues. My being gay doesn't qualify me to speak on behalf of the trans community because some of the issues that face each of our communities aren't the same, even though we're sort of classified together as LGBTQ. How can the different communities within the LGBTQ community be allies to one another while also being mindful of our privilege and not inadvertently oppressing folks?

Any feedback, comments, opinions, or thoughts you can add would be awesome.
