It all started with ""would it okay if I wore your clothes sometimes"" because they were pretty and didn't take us long to realize that this wasn't just cross dressing but he may be transgender. 

He wanted to express himself at home so I told him to be honest with his family and his mum doesn't want to accept this (seriously she is a nice person, I just think she doesn't know what to think) So now he has built up a wardrobe of clothing and can only wear it at my house (I live in a bungalow so lots of privacy)


The other night he just went in tears before bed. He was so sad and upset with himself for being un-attractive and for wearing girls clothes. (I also have a broken sex drive which does not help)
He was sad that he's mum doesn't accept him and that I wasn't getting 'in the mood' with him in his girl clothing. I had to comfort him and tell him that it wasn't his fault and that my body really just sucks and that his mum is just dealing with her own stuff right now and doesn't know how to handle things.

I am very proud of her bravery and admire her willingness to speak about trans issues on facebook and in person.  However something always rubs me the wrong way about the way she speaks now.

The way that she addresses CIShet white males aggressively in almost every status update; talking about white male privilege.  Status' are often about how cishet white males  are promoting oppression by doing nothing about it or are bigoted by simply being a cishet white male.  She then states that by even trying to defend yourself as a cishet white male that you are part of the problem and are attempting to deflect the issue. These are all issues that I think people would have a hard time denying the presence of (our entire society systemically oppresses minorities) but it feels so wrong for her to be labeling an entire group of people based on things that they haven't chosen themselves, and then essentially accusing them of things that they don't believe in and based on the actions of ignorant CISHET males.  Like she is trying to tell her allies that by living the lives they were given they aren't doing enough for the trans (or other oppressed) communities, and then not telling us what we can even do to help.


I ask you guys if you think this is OK?  Is my friend just potentially going through an angry stage of her transition?  What CAN I do to help?  I don't like to make her feel uncomfortable and I'm very supportive but I also really dislike being accused of bigotry I do not take part in.   

I also ask that if you create groups of people to blame for oppression to be more specific, maybe instead of calling out all cishet white males to call out the bigots instead, and create a new label for that. As a cishet white male myself it just all feels very aggressive and makes it hard for me to sympathize with someone who essentially talks down and disregards my beliefs as I try to be an ally.

EDIT:  I've recently tried to educate myself on the ""Not *all* men"" meme and what it means.  I really understand where it's coming from and I guess that's where my last point shines through.  Why not completely remove the need for people to tell you ""not all men"" and begin by accusing the right people instead of an entire group?

I just have question I've been curious about the past little while, 

If you were born physically male but identify as female, and you were attracted to men, would you consider yourself straight or gay?

Do you owe me an explanation? NO

Do I deserve to be labeled transphobe because I question you?  NO

Stop this shit. I love you, but at this point I can't even approach a trans (I'm very attracted to trans) without feeling like cis scum.

I realize you go through hardships and many trans face difficulties finding acceptance. But by projecting on to someone who is innocently inquiring into your identity, you're hurting your cause and frankly not being a nice person.

And no, I won't stop asking. When I meet a gay man, we talk about our sexual history and coming out. When I meet a trans, I bring up the matter of being trans and all the sudden I'm an oppressor. It needs to stop.

Tl;Dr questioning trans is not oppressing trans

2014-06-22 20:52:04,28th2q,3,8,"Ironically I pretty much came to this realization being (very regretfully) opposed to transgender people years ago.  I kept making arguments where I would very confidently assert that *nobody* felt strongly attached to their gender.  Incidentally, I also learned that the thought experiment ""If you woke up tomorrow as the opposite sex wouldn't you just roll with that"" has a pretty clear answer for most people. :-/

I don't think I really feel male.  I'm not super into my body, I don't have any real attachment to my dick beyond that it fairly clutch part of my sex life.  I dress fairly well and try to take care of myself but it always feels like a somewhat academic exercise in vanity rather than that I love the way I look.  This is rather difficult to explain -- I'm not dressing myself in a particular manner because it makes *me* feel good or even because I think it looks particularly flattering.  I don't feel particularly displeased with my body, just not particularly attached to it either.  I dress/care for it for other people.

I've never really gotten along particularly well with straight men, though that could just be chalked up to me not being a particularly masculine guy.  I end up throwing up this fairly blustery facade around men that I don't do around women (to the point that my girlfriend has told me she doesn't recognize my voice) when I'm in mixed company.

I recently graduated high school &amp; lived on my own for a while. For reasons not entirely unrelated to being trans (depression stemming from dysphoria &amp; the tribulations of being trans in Texas, for the most part), that didn't work out, so I moved back in with my mom. After a few months of that, and a visit from my widowed grandmother, we decided it would be best for me to move in with Grandma. 

I loved this new living situation at first. She's a lovely lady, an excellent cook, and has helped me out in more ways than I can name. There's one problem though - she's rather old fashioned. You know what that means... If you're gay, trans, black, you name it - anything other than being a white, straight, cisgendered Christian - you're a bad person.

While I was first moving in, she found some panties &amp; other female clothing. I was able to explain it away as clothing from an ex girlfriend that got lost in my bags. Just a couple weeks ago, she found my makeup.

I've been able to hide everything so far, but... I don't know if this is even the right course of action.

I'm most likely going to be in this living situation for the next couple years, until I get my Associate's degree &amp; transfer to a larger college for my Bachelor's.

Should I continue doing what I've been doing - wearing makeup and occasionally dressing according to my internal gender, despite the possibly fallout should I be confronted? Or is there some quaternary option that I've missed?

I know I won't be able to transition while I'm here. I don't think her poor old heart could handle the change of her little boy becoming a little girl.
