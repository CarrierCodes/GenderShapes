2014-07-01 05:31:06,29jgxd,4,10,"I put together a multireddit which I think contains almost all of the subreddits about transgender topics (amounting to a rather staggering ~~86~~ 90 subreddits):

* [Trans multireddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/anonymouslogician/m/trans) -- NSFW, due to the inclusion of porn subreddits
* [Trans multireddit (clean version)](http://www.reddit.com/user/anonymouslogician/m/trans_clean) -- porn removed

The trans multireddit includes not only transgender focused reddits, but also reddits about related topics like crossdressing, and about trans-related fetishes (e.g. /r/sissies and /r/femalepov -- both NSFW). It also includes major reddits which are partially trans-focused, such as /r/lgbt. Some of the porn reddits in here might strike some as trans fetishizing, so trigger warning for that.

The clean version simply removes all porn. That does not guarantee that all posts will be safe for work.

Please message me if you are aware of trans reddits not included here, or if you find some porn reddits in the clean version, or other issues with the lists.

The way I gathered these reddits was by starting with a few I knew of, and following their links to related subreddits in the sidebars, repeating that process until it stopped yielding new reddits.

And I feel a bit confused. For example, I have a casual friend, a guy, that is trans. If anyone referred to him as ""female"" it would feel very wrong and I would ask them to use ""male"".

Using male/female based on chromosomes and masculine/feminine for gender feels completely absurd to me. A man can be feminine and a woman can be masculine. How masculine or feminine you are doesn't really matter to what gender you identify as to me.

Since I've gotten so many downvotes but not really knowing from who I thought I would ask here and see how people who are trans or more involved in trans issues view this topic.

And the other thing, ""born a man, then changed to woman"". Any trans-person I have talked to, although not many, don't like that. They didn't change their gender, they corrected it, or came to terms with it, or made themselves be seen as who they really are etc.

2014-07-08 17:43:12,2a5t84,16,6,"Hey, my name is Katie, and a friend of mine and I are planning out a webcomic featuring a transwoman hero. Nora Rosales is a military specialist with telekinetic powers, now beginning ""domestic deployment"" to address a rise in very destructive activist crimes. As her story progresses, she also begins hormone replacement therapy, and while her transition is not a main focus of the plot, the Male -&gt; Female transition parallels other ways that her character grows, including her  Soldier -&gt; Hero shift.

I come to Reddit to ask for help on how to accurately write and draw Nora's transition. My friend and I are queer women, but we are cisgender, and we want to make sure that Nora's story is accurate and respectful to the trans community. We want to write a story that diversely represents gender and sexuality in the context of a mostly-normal life, and where the hero of the day is a brave, strong transwoman, something that the traditional monoliths of comics currently lack.

I'm currently stuck on a scene that portrays a first appointment with an endocrinologist. What gets discussed? Are there tests? What makes a ""good candidate"" for HRT? What are some of the most frequent first prescriptions? 

Moving forward from there, I hope to use a kind of transition timeline so that my friend and I know what Nora should look like at different points in the story. I've seen a lot of really beautiful photo-timelines of transition, and we hope that, if you pulled panels from different times in the comic, you'd eventually end up with a similar effect. The problem is, I need a literal, text-based timeline that describes exactly what starts when.

Is this true??? I live in Denver, btw, and I can't find such a thing. but of course, it's hard to dig through all the laws. I know they have to provide neutral bathrooms, but i can't find anything else.

The thing is, it seems like RadFems think that transgenderism is a complete sham.

I am going in for my first appointment tomorrow for hrt (yay!). I first came out to my mom and her husband, my step-father. My mother had always kinda knew and my step dad out right didn't believe me. Hat hurt and through respect for him I spent he next 7 years trying harder than I had ever tried to fit in as a boy. After many failed relationships,  depression and repression of feelings. I finally decided that I can no longer live this lie. I came out to my boss, who is currently my best friend, and he took to it rather well. I however talked to his long term girlfriend (5 years) and she was not so ok with it stating that I was lying to her and myself about the situation. I was heartbroken over this and I had honestly hoped that she would accept me as her me and my boss all live together and have a sort of relationship all our own. She briefly kicked me out of her apartment in order to make me think. I thought long and hard in the next few weeks as I slept outside living with no home. After the loss of her acceptance and the acceptance of both my parents I decided I would spend all of my last bit of money on alcohol and drink myself to death. Go out doing what you lived I had thought at the time. So I sat with my blue pen in hand and wrote this letter to those I loved. 

If I do not make it through the night, know first that I loved all of you. My life thus far has been a difficult 23 or so years. I feel as though I have wrestled many demons in my time. My desires all of them. They are more difficult for me to handle than I am capable of unfortunately. Know that my greatest wish and regret and wish as I lay dying is that I wasn't born a woman. Though born a man I would, no I do, quiver to think of any person remembering me as such. Please gather and mother, forgive me for letting you down; I was never the first born son you deserved. I was incapable despite my trying. Oh how I tried, oh how I tried. Next after my parents I feel an obligation to Jacob Piland (my best friend and a Mormon) know this: as a person there is something you could have done to prevent this; however as yourself, being authentic to your nature you could not have stopped me. There is no shame in this. To Luke and Sara (my boss and his girlfriend): my loves. I wish we could have been everything I have imagined. I hopeore than anything in my life that you can find the happiness in life that only I can imagine. I love you both in the least plutonic way. To Daniel: (my close friend) I will always miss your face. (He always used to say this). I pray that you will never stop missing mine. That line was the hardest to write of the lot. To Whitney: (Daniels girl friend who believed in me) thanks for believing in me. Sometimes as an adult (she is 5 years younger than me) all we need is someone's approval, someone's confirmation of our feelings. Never forget how important it is I believe. If any of you forget this principal lesson of my life than my life was for nothing and all I sacrificed for naught. Good night for what maybe the last time.

With every loving thought, I believed in your happiness.
Alexandria Molly Lefleur. 

P.s. : as this out of all of my notebooks may be read after my passing, I thought it maybe relevant (oops drunk sad me messed up on punctuation) to include my reasoning of my last signature. The name I signed was Alexandria Molly LeFleur. Over the decades of my life I have conjured this name to have more meaning than any other. First Alexandria. The full name of both aly Johnson, my first love, and Taryn Ali spears, my first girlfriend. To give it more cultural relevance toyself (I am Greek) it is also Greek for defender of humanity. Which I have fried to be with every breath. Molly is the Irish form of Mary, mother of god. Anyone who knew me knows the significance of that. (Remember I'm drinking whiskey to lol myself). A strong matriarch is all I dream of and all I will ever wish to be. Finally LeFleur. Was a family name given in France to those who died in battle for the crown. I myself was quite fond of the name Bellmont after the famous imaginary vampire hunters; it didn't quite fit here however. The idea of seeking out and destroying evil was very important to me. 

So yeah that's what I wrote. I hope you enjoyed reading it and hope some one can find hope in fact that  although I know it's hard... Oh how I know... You can over come this prejudice. I will move forward ever onward towards my dreams. I hope you join me.
