I'm currently in my last year of undergraduate education, and after that, i'm off to grad school. I've been transitioning for 2 and a half years, and luckily was able to pull off living full time as soon as i started transitioning thanks to my pre-hrt androgynous boy body.  As a child i would be mistaken for a girl all the time, and though it used to frustrate my parents, it made my heart flutter in secrecy because people were seeing me for the girl i knew i was at heart. I don't want to go in to a full blown autobiography because i sure as hell know i wouldn't want to read such a long passage. I digress to my original question and concern. Have any of you guys rejected a girl in the past that you liked when she told you she was transgender? I am lucky enough that i get approached by men, but i am always honest and tell them up front that i'm trans. Not all of them are repelled by it, but i would say that at least 80-90% of them can't deal with such a debilitating fact( at least to them it is), and they tell me that they aren't gay and never talk to me again. Why are guys so worried about labels when it comes to who they are attracted to. They were initially attracted to me because they saw a girl, but when i told them about my past they didn't see me as a girl anymore(bummer, i know) and went on to tell me they aren't gay. 1) gay guys aren't attracted to girls, hence why i can't date gay men. 2) if there was a definitional term that described someone's romantic interest for transgender people, would they be more comfortable dating us, therfore not having to worry about being labeled gay? 3) why do guys have to care so much about a label so much that they reject an opportunity of love with someone they obviously find attractive and have chemistry with? I am not on  transgender dating sites for a couple of reasons: most of them just want me to fuck them in the ass ( which i guess falls under the fantasy category), they want me to keep my girly c**k, they live too far away, and there is a limited amount of men in my area.  In all honesty, i've had better success with men who weren't looking for a transchick, but they just happen to stumble upon yours truly. Where are the men who don't care about what society thinks about their personal romantic choices? Where are the men who aren't so focused on the GAY label. ugh! look at me! I'm a girl!! I currently have blonde hair at the moment, so the pics with blonde are most recent; including the one in the pirate costume that i took this past halloween night.

I finally feel like a human being, but I can't seem to cope with the fact that I missed out for so long, missed having a ""normal"" youth, missed having made sexual experiences and/ or having a relationship and so on.


I'm 35yrs old, ftm, gay...I started hormones when I was 30.

Until I turned 20 I had a nice bunch of friends, but was always the quiet one, enjoyed being around people but most times was minding my own business. 
I never really felt like a girl, but was not really familiar with the concept of transsexuality, so I thought that I'm just some sort of freak, a lovely one though.

I hardly had female friends back then and all my guy-friends treated me like one of their own....rumor started I'd be a lesbian (even though I never was interested in women)... I didn't care really, maybe I was a latebloomer, but I just wasn't really that interested in sex and relationship back then, I was pretty succesfull with sports and that was what I was doing in my free time.

After school I felt like I need to move away to get away from the life I was living and maybe find myself, I got a job in the music business and turned into a workaholic, I've worked up to 10-12hrs a day every day and going partying in my free time including all the alcohol and drug abuse that comes with it. 

I've made a cut with 25, quit my job and tried going to college but started struggeling with social phobia and depression, to an extent that I wasn't even able to pick up the phone when someone was calling. I was unemployed living from welfare for approx 5 years, I didn't have any contact to the outside world during that time, spending my days playing computer games, reading books, watching videos and sleeping. 

Life did get incredibly better since I started hormones and living as who I am: a pretty laid-back, educated, polite and fun guy to hang round with.


I'm 35 and I look like a teenager due to the fact I'm super small and slim (168cm, ~55kg) and I feel like I'm 20 just finished school and gonna start over with my life now....and it feels like I don't fit in anywhere really.
I mean, I'm actually a happy person when I'm all for myself but whenever I'm around people...I'm stressed.
I don't get along with people my age really as I feel somewhat inferior to them what has a lot to do with my physical specs I think, but also because I just never really have worked in my life so far or had a relationship and such. Also: most people my age just live a whole different life and I don't even know if I ever turn that way.
On the other hand: onn college I don't really want to hang out with those kids either as most of them are just ...""kids"", they're in their 20's and 15 years can make a hell of a difference.
I have a lot of people around me but I really don't feel like I enjoy being around them
I'd consider myself to have 1 friend, she's my best triend since like 15 years and the only person I still have contact with from pre-transition times. 

As for relationships and sex:
I'd love to have that but I'm super insecure and ashamed of not having ANY experience. Given the fact I'm ftm doesn't make things easier to explain to people. 

All of this is draining (or already has drained) all life energy from me and I'm super afraid of failing college as I'm just getting more and more lazy and start retreating from social life again (but only because I don't really find people I really enjoy hanging around with), I can't find motivation to go to lectures, read books, study and so on.

Actually, my life really ain't that bad, I just don't know how to deal with the fact I've lost so many years and failed to make so many experiences in the past.

2014-11-22 23:17:38,2n4b4f,10,1,"I would like to start and say that I'm not transgender. I'm androgynous and my gender has never been a huge part of who I am, and I came to terms with myself many years ago in this respect. But I will say this much, if this is anything what you people go through, then I have my absolute condolences.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place, there is no subreddit for the exact crisis that I'm going through and since it after talking with a few transwomen about my experiences and the relatedness of our issues we decided this is the best place to talk about it.

On Thursday I received a stark reminder of a skeleton that I have been trying to hide for years. I was reading an article about identity disorders, and I was reading transgender people putting their own input into it. One was explaining to a cisgendered person what the whole transwoman thing was all about. The person described it as being a mental unhappiness with her own body.

And suddenly that skeleton emerged. Not in the form of gender, but in the form of a disability.

While my earliest memories confound me (a skiing accident is likely the root of this), my earliest memories of a conflict of between my body and my image was when I was 8 years old or so (give or take a year). I remember for some reason, out of absolutely nowhere, that I was a blind actress. I imagined myself listening to people talk about me, and it felt like my destiny. That evening, as the sun set, I began to stare into it with my right eye. Due to the fact that it was late, and that staring into the sun is extremely difficult, no permanent damage outside of photosensitivity occurred in that eye. 

As I was going through my teenage years, I kept having little thoughts and ""fantasies"" (not sexual mind you) of going blind. Different stories, different actions all leading to the same thing.  I specifically remember spending a lot of time when I was in chemistry thinking about these things. There was a Carol Poster (http://www.flinnsci.com/store/catalogPhotos/AP6373.jpg) in the room, which was a running gag with the teacher. Most students saw the intended message - wear your safety goggles.

But I asked how it happened. I wanted to know what the story behind her descent into darkness was. And as wrong as it may sound, it was to fix what was wrong with myself.

Through these years, I felt that there was some way that I had to be. Some way that I had to follow metaphorical Carol into the darkness myself. A gravitational pull into a black hole, where no light would ever come out of again. 

Years passed. I got in a relationship with a blind man. Born with light perception, it was the most interesting experience I think I've had to this day. And for some reason I would constantly want to trade with him, just to *know*. My other blind friends thought this was fairly strange, but I think he seemed to understand. He told me that he thinks that I was reincarnated from a blind person who died in a horrific accident. I don't really believe in reincarnation, but I used the idea to try to ""vent"" these persistent feelings, which, as time went on grew stronger and stronger.

Within this conflict, I realized there were two players - emotion and logic. Logic is the only reason why I'm where I'm at now in life - thanks to logic I'm still able to have functionality in my eyes. But emotion is the skeletons in my closet. It, since that day as a child, that it wants a means to an end. People say to me - ""What if you regret your decision 10 years from now?"" and they don't understand that the feelings have only grown more intense in the last 13! It's very very scary though.

I realized on Thursday that submission of logic is inevitable. Logic requires reasons to continue to protect myself, and thus presents reasons why I can't stick a vial of lye in my eyes. The emotional side thus struck a deal - when there is a case when all of these ""open shoelaces"" are eventually ""tied"", it would be able to triumph against the logic. I have gotten extremely close to taking this away from me for ever on several occasions, due to this lack of of ""open shoelaces"" - it was honestly only because I discovered some at the last minute that I still have my vision. I now am considering writing a list of ""open shoelaces"" of accomplishments that I must make so that if I lose this battle, that I have completed what I wanted to do.

I'm mostly scared not because of who I am but how the world will perceive me. People are so foolish with blindness, they act like going blind is like dying. I know enough people going blind to know this isn't the truth, and that it's the perpetuation of these ideas that scare people more than the actual loss itself. I learned that my life could be manageable. But what holds me back is that if they ever found out the truth to my own mutilation, when I do it, they won't just see me as a poor blind woman, but they'll see me as a crazy horrible person. They'll want me locked up, and that's the worst thing they can do. To strip everything that I am because I tried to absolve myself from an evil feeling that will never go away, a feeling that grows with each sunset, with every image I see, until that fateful day comes.

Like I've said, it's not really a matter of if anymore, the shock on Thursday made me realize this. I have to open my arms and weep, knowing that my demons will one day consume me. And it's not that I fear it, but rather that I don't know what the future will hold. All I know is that my mind keeps begging for become it.

After telling my transwoman friend about it, she told me that if I use a blindfold that it would help relieve some of these tensions, for the same reason many transgender people wear the opposite sex's clothes. It did help, I was surprised. But I know that's not going to be good enough. It can pacify my inherent desires now. But it won't work forever. I'm thinking about getting completely black contacts and using them always while I'm in my apartment... but even that won't protect me.

I'm afraid of becoming a ""pretender"". I fully respect the men and women that who were born without a choice to the condition that my brain so idolizes. I have deep running morals, tied deeply with my internal obsession with canes, obscuring sunglasses, and the like. To me they're off limits until that day comes. Why? Because I am not someone who wants to ""pretend"", and I cannot submit to ""pretending"". People who pretend to be blind for jokes and things like that make me so furious, and it's instantly able to be seen, because the idiots have no idea how to use a damn cane. I vowed to myself I would never fall to that low. But I've taught myself how to use one. I even will be using it for a costume after I got a severe foot injury wearing it. And I feel that using it will simply indulge myself more, when my thoughts turn into nothing but this, and I have to face the darkness one last time.

I'm preparing myself for my future. I think people know that there is a dark side, I think they can sense it. I know the blindies know, but even others have seemed to give that vibe. They know that my obsessions with blindness, their techniques of observing the world, and my interest in empathizing with their experience runs deep.

I know that I need help, I'm going to speak to someone soon. I'm scared. I don't want to be considered crazy - I'm otherwise quite mentally stable despite my other challenges. I'm able to manage a full time job, school, personal life and even this without breaking down, and when I did there was a reason and I recovered. It's not like I'm crazy, but I know these urges are growing more intense, and know that logic is going to be cornered eventually and have to submit. I'm scared of that future, but I also want to embrace it. It's a oxymoron that persists through my mind - a feeling of denial of existence but fear of removing my own. Tension has come to a boil and I have no choice but to come out.

Before this, I used these feelings to empathize with the community and take and help them with their own challenges and the inequalities they faced. And even though I will continue to dedicate myself to that cause, I cannot just pour it all into that bucket anymore.

I don't want to attach any sort of ""trans"" label onto myself, ultimately because I am conflicted on any sort of transition, despite knowing that it will come eventually. My brain's freedom from these thoughts is becoming so much smaller and smaller.

Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place. There is literally nowhere else I can put this, outside of the small blind forums of those whom I trust, to which I've already written. I gathered all of my strength to post here, I'm sorry if it's not right. If this goes against the rules, then so be it. But I believe that if this is what dysphoria is then I have all of my sympathies.

People say to me - ""What if you regret your decision 10 years from now?"" and they don\'t understand that the feelings have only grown more intense in the last 13! It\'s very very scary though.\n\nI realized on Thursday that submission of logic is inevitable. Logic requires reasons to continue to protect myself, and thus presents reasons why I can\'t stick a vial of lye in my eyes. The emotional side thus struck a deal - when there is a case when all of these ""open shoelaces"" are eventually ""tied"", it would be able to triumph against the logic. I have gotten extremely close to taking this away from me for ever on several occasions, due to this lack of of ""open shoelaces"" - it was honestly only because I discovered some at the last minute that I still have my vision. I now am considering writing a list of ""open shoelaces"" of accomplishments that I must make so that if I lose this battle, that I have completed what I wanted to do.\n\nI\'m mostly scared not because of who I am but how the world will perceive me. People are so foolish with blindness, they act like going blind is like dying. I know enough people going blind to know this isn\'t the truth, and that it\'s the perpetuation of these ideas that scare people more than the actual loss itself. I learned that my life could be manageable. But what holds me back is that if they ever found out the truth to my own mutilation, when I do it, they won\'t just see me as a poor blind woman, but they\'ll see me as a crazy horrible person. They\'ll want me locked up, and that\'s the worst thing they can do. To strip everything that I am because I tried to absolve myself from an evil feeling that will never go away, a feeling that grows with each sunset, with every image I see, until that fateful day comes.\n\nLike I\'ve said, it\'s not really a matter of if anymore, the shock on Thursday made me realize this. I have to open my arms and weep, knowing that my demons will one day consume me. And it\'s not that I fear it, but rather that I don\'t know what the future will hold. All I know is that my mind keeps begging for become it.\n\nAfter telling my transwoman friend about it, she told me that if I use a blindfold that it would help relieve some of these tensions, for the same reason many transgender people wear the opposite sex\'s clothes. It did help, I was surprised. But I know that\'s not going to be good enough. It can pacify my inherent desires now. But it won\'t work forever. I\'m thinking about getting completely black contacts and using them always while I\'m in my apartment... but even that won\'t protect me.\n\nI\'m afraid of becoming a ""pretender"". I fully respect the men and women that who were born without a choice to the condition that my brain so idolizes. I have deep running morals, tied deeply with my internal obsession with canes, obscuring sunglasses, and the like. To me they\'re off limits until that day comes. Why? Because I am not someone who wants to ""pretend"", and I cannot submit to ""pretending"". People who pretend to be blind for jokes and things like that make me so furious, and it\'s instantly able to be seen, because the idiots have no idea how to use a damn cane. I vowed to myself I would never fall to that low. But I\'ve taught myself how to use one. I even will be using it for a costume after I got a severe foot injury wearing it. And I feel that using it will simply indulge myself more, when my thoughts turn into nothing but this, and I have to face the darkness one last time.\n\nI\'m preparing myself for my future. I think people know that there is a dark side, I think they can sense it. I know the blindies know, but even others have seemed to give that vibe. They know that my obsessions with blindness, their techniques of observing the world, and my interest in empathizing with their experience runs deep.\n\nI know that I need help, I\'m going to speak to someone soon. I\'m scared. I don\'t want to be considered crazy - I\'m otherwise quite mentally stable despite my other challenges. I\'m able to manage a full time job, school, personal life and even this without breaking down, and when I did there was a reason and I recovered. It\'s not like I\'m crazy, but I know these urges are growing more intense, and know that logic is going to be cornered eventually and have to submit. I\'m scared of that future, but I also want to embrace it. It\'s a oxymoron that persists through my mind - a feeling of denial of existence but fear of removing my own. Tension has come to a boil and I have no choice but to come out.\n\nBefore this, I used these feelings to empathize with the community and take and help them with their own challenges and the inequalities they faced. And even though I will continue to dedicate myself to that cause, I cannot just pour it all into that bucket anymore.\n\nI don\'t want to attach any sort of ""trans"" label onto myself, ultimately because I am conflicted on any sort of transition, despite knowing that it will come eventually. My brain\'s freedom from these thoughts is becoming so much smaller and smaller.\n\nAgain, I\'m sorry if this isn\'t the right place. There is literally nowhere else I can put this, outside of the small blind forums of those whom I trust, to which I\'ve already written. I gathered all of my strength to post here, I\'m sorry if it\'s not right. If this goes against the rules, then so be it. But I believe that if this is what dysphoria is then I have all of my sympathies.\n\nThank you for reading.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Cornered', 'created': 1416723458.0}"
