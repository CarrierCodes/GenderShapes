Now, at 15, I still don't identify as female but I can't really figure out what I want to be.

I do feel the need to be a male, but my mtf friend had a go at me and went on about how I wasn't actually trans because I didn't feel the need to be a super macho, hairy, swole dude with a beard and everything, even though I felt the need to have uh, all the private parts and have a less feminine figure. 

She said that most ftm guys feel like they need to be really masculine looking to be considered a 'proper' male, so I'm probably not ftm because I don't like the idea of being really hairy, with like a huge beard and chiseled jaw, and all that.

So I want to physically be a guy, with guy pronouns and all that, but not overtly masculine *or* feminine.. just kinda androgynous I guess. So am I just a confused cis girl like my mtf friend said, or not? Because what she said really made me question it and I don't really know anymore.

Since I was 6 or 7 I can distinctly remember wishing to be a girl, and showing distaste for my masculinity. I was raised in a very religious and conservative family, and as such wasnt exposed to the idea of sex changes being a real thing people did until I was 15 or so, before then I thought I was alone with my weird fantasies of being a princess, or wishing I could be the beautiful love interest in movies instead of the hero. at the time I was so embarassed and confused I never wouldve admitted to myself its something I may have really wanted in real life.

Fast forward a few years, and I discovered rachel's haven and tgcomics, which I owe a great deal for exposing me to (at least a corner of) the trans community, but they're both heavily fetishised sites, where mtf trans is portrayed to be as much of a sexual kink as an actual thing people do to become who they should be.

possibly as a result of this, I feel sometimes like any desire I have to transition may only  be secondary to the very *very* sexual feelings I have towards the idea of feminization.

So... basically what Im confused about, is I have no idea if I legitimately would be happier or more fulfille living as a woman, or if Im just a guy with an odd fetish.

Does anyone have any thoughts? Any advice? Anyone experience something similar? Anyone just want to blanketly encourage me to go be a girl?

2014-12-20 03:34:28,2pur6n,9,7,"Hi there,

I'm sorry if the title is unclear; I'm a bit unsure about what to say here.

I'm 17m, but I think I'm trans. This post is because it's just that, I THINK I am. I'm really confused, and I wanted to talk about stuff here. I've not talked to anyone I really know, and this account is just for this purpose.

I've been thinking about this for what feels like a while now, but I only really thought about this seriously since last summer. Between then and now, my feelings have been pretty inconsistent. Sometimes, I'm totally fine, I just go about my life as if everything were fine, but I keep coming back to thinking about this. I'm trying to understand, but I don't know what to do alone. I keep thinking that the fact that I'm so lost about it is reason to believe I'm cis, but the fact that I keep thinking about it again makes me think I'm not.

I think about my life, and I'm still confused. I've never been too far either way, masculine or feminine. I'm an Eagle Scout (this sounds masculine but I hope I can explain), but it felt like just some completion thing. I just wanted the end and the leadership, but I really didn't like it near the end. Once I got to the end, I left, and I only talk to one person from scouts now. Again, I feel like this is pulling me both ways, and I really don't know where I stand.

I really like math and computers, which is apparently more common in men, but I don't feel like that is big enough to mean much. It likely doesn't tell anyone anything about me, but I want to give the best picture I can without getting too personal.

How do I actually figure this out? I've read so many stories where people say that they knew from when they were small, but I STILL don't know what's going on with me. Why is it so hard for me to understand this? Shouldn't I know myself at least?

2014-12-26 22:36:53,2qhc7z,5,6,"The 12 months has been a nightmare for me. I am a transfemale who lived in a small town that barely accepted people of other color then Caucasians. I suffer from Major depression and bipolar disorder with a codependency issue because of my fathers drinking when i was younger. Although I do not drink myself. I have been living fully as a female since march 2014 and been on hormones since march 2013. This is me in a nutshell. I am very slow at processing things, I have not acheived much in my life. I pretty much kept to myself. I was that friend that you only had because you felt sorry for.
This is my story. Less then a year ago I was at the brink of my end with a couple suicide attempts because well i could give you so many excuses. Someone pulled me out of it only to end up hurting me and abusing me in the end. I had an excellent job with Amazon.com Customer service work from home which gave me everything I could have possibly wanted. Then in march I started dressing as a female and since then i was exceptionally happy. I was able to be myself and I didnt care what anyone thought. Most of my friends while supportive to my face would not be as supportive behind my back.
I lost my insurance that paid for my depression andd mood medication which caused me to fall into a deep depression that affected my job. I had to go on medical leave in order to take care of myself. I didnt have much when it came to mmy dressing female. A few skirts and a couple blouses. A lady across the way actually was nice enough and started donating stuff to me.. At that time I didnt realise that same lady cause alot of other people in my apartment complex to want to kick me out.. So thats what happened. between being kicked out of my apartment complex because of ""Unrelated"" 4 write ups in 3 days. I ended up losing everything.
By this point most of my friends have moved on and I have little to rely upon not even my own brother living in the area was willing/able to help me. So into the dumpster EVERYTHING i could not pack in a small clothing bag and a back pack ended up going. I spent the next month and a half in a domestic violence shelter for women across the river in another state. This state did not allow me to work from home in because of amazon taxes. I desperatly tried to get back to the state to start working. however everytime we tried doors shut because I was trans and since that state does not have any protection about it.
during the time at the shelter, the director and the ladies there were wonderful to me and accepting. I was not completely able to ""pass"" by the standards that allowed me to be safe from persacution by the outside world but the ladies there helped me with learning and grasping make up and doing my hair and stuff like that. I will always be greatful to them.
A little while after being there. I knew there was nothing I could do to get back. I had to make a decision which anyone who knows me knows it is a hard thing for me to do. I ended up going back to my home town where a majority of my family lived including my mother and one of my brothers. While my aunt stead fast as well as her children and grandchildren acepted me and called my by the right stuff with a slip here and there. My mother and brother was another choice. My oldest brother told me that he was not gonna introduce me to his daughter because it would confuse her and at that point did not have any pants. Still living on a couple skirts and a dress. My mother who i believed was the most accepting of all of them showed that she was not or atleast not in my ideal way.
Livng there I tried to get into one of the larger cities to find help and acceptance because this struggle was too much. i was without a home, very little possessions and my medications including hormones and blockers ran out. It was difficult. I was desperatly looking for freinds I could be social with in order to combat the depression even putting in an add on criagslist.
The ad ended up helping me find the love of my life who I am with currently. He accepted me and identifies as straight. While still not knowing which bed or floor i was going to sleep on that night except for the breif times my BF asked me to stay over for a couple nights. It was not easy. I looked at community action, there was no help with clothing or anything because They dont help people like me. They were gonna try to get me to a bigger city.
in Oct. the guy I am with ended up asking me to come live with him. He lived outside a rather large town. I accepted and Here I am. While I do now have a place to live and we have the essentials of life I am still stuck with some problems. I did finally get my medical needs taken care of. I am starting to get back on my medication and stuff like that. I still have alot that is almost impossible for me to do.
I would like to go back to work but generally since I do not have my name legally changed walking in for an interveiw becomes increadibly uncomfertable to the interveiwerss. I end up not getting the job or some excuse when someone else does granted I could do and have better experience of others. I thought about going back to college but I have loans which make it close to being impossible. I want to be a psychologist to help people like me in the LGBTQI community.
So with this long story, It is hard for me to ask for money, Someone has suggested this long long ago but I just didnt do it because. I have be bullied all my life and i kinda stick to the notion of fend for yourself. But I do need help. I am still trying to get back on my feet. While I do have an excellent boyfriend and a roof over my head. I was homeless for over 6 months.
