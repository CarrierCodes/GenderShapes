2014-04-23 21:53:03,23szfs,8,10,"Throwaway for obvious reasons....

So basically I completely severed all ties with my old life when I decided to transition. I haven't had contact with my family for years before that, no friends, and quit all jobs/commitments. I was completely free and ""lay low"" for over a year while I changed.

I reemerged a new person. I got a court ordered name change, got a new ID and new SS card, and began meeting people with my new identity. I couldn't be happier with my new life!

Now I need a job! And my first worry was a background check - will the old name/gender automatically pop up? I'm in a tough industry and it's hard enough to find a job without that added hurdle. So far what I have been doing is leaving blank the ""any former names or aliases"" space, and if it comes down to it, I can privately explain to the HR person what the situation is.

What's more concerning though is job references. I feel like I really should not have to call up employers that I haven't spoken to in years and tell them what I've done - I intentionally quit everything so nobody has to know and I want to keep it that way. I also don't feel it's best to tell every prospective employer what the deal is. They don't need a reason to turn me down or start gossip in such a narrow industry. 

What's terrible is I'm ""photoshopping"" my new name onto written references, and asking friends to fake being professional references. I know it's wrong and it really sucks when I know my past employers LOVED me, but I just can't bear to drag my old life into my new one.

I just want to start fresh. I've tried volunteering and getting ""under the table"" jobs just so SOMEONE who knows me by my new identity can vouch for me, but even that required references.

This is so frustrating. I just want to get my life started but I feel so stuck.
