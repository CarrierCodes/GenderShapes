2014-02-22 18:12:15,1ymz8l,0,1,"I'm a 28 year old pre-op MtF, and have recently begun making a blog dedicated to my battle with forced social male conditioning, which I was a victim of. For all of my childhood, I grew up in Las Vegas, in a school environment where if a male acted female or feminine, they were immediately reviled and/or pushed away (figuratively) by other males(the social male conditioning I was talking about). The trauma was so bad, I basically ""forced"" myself to be male at ""figurative gunpoint"". My parents didn't help either. Despite trying to be good parents, they would mock my feminine motions and behaviors and laugh, and sometimes I'd laugh but deep down I was hurting. 

Around 26, I finally realized why I had felt so miserable and cheated, the memories flooding back, and since then, every month or so, I'll have a night where my scars open back up and I'll be fighting just not to cry. I have friends willing to let me vent and snug them (if only online), but I haven't had the courage to meet people since moving to Temecula, CA. I have changed physicians because my last one was incompetent, and I am hoping this new one, with the California Transgender Laws for insurance, will help me on my way to HRT.

So as I'm about to possibly start HRT, I'm trying to think of ways to limit the emotional scars reopening so often.

My girlfriend and I are looking at options for her SRS (MtF). Our country doesn't really offer SRS so we have to travel over seas and the endo doctor here has recommended Bangkok.
