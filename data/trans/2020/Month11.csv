2020-11-01 05:48:11,jlxi68,2,1,"I'm sorry, I'm not too sure if this is the right subreddit to post this but I was looking to get some advice/perspective on this situation

My close friend (MTF) has been transitioning for the past few years and as of this year has completely transitioned. Over this journey she has grown a lot and Im very happy for the person she has become. Despite her complete transition, she struggles with body dysmorphia and low self esteem, which is understandable considering her journey. 

She's been active on the dating scene but has never been in a serious relationship before. For the past month and half, shes been seeing this guy and she really likes him. He seems to like her a lot as well and I think she's hoping this turns into something serious down the road. This guy does not know she is trans. They've been intimate in other ways before but they have not had sex. 

She let me know she might be having sex with him soon and for some reason this really concerned me. I think it would be better for her if she let him know beforehand that she is trans. I feel like guys can be very unpredictable when it comes to dating trans women and I've come across stories of men being violent towards women after discovering their trans. I just feel if she let him know beforehand, if its not something he's okay with, they can end it there and there no harm done. On the plus side, if hes cool with it, she'll be much more comfortable being intimate with him and it would be a more pleasant experience. On the downside, if they do get intimate and she decides to tell him after, if he's not okay with it, who knows how he will respond? If hes okay with it, then thats the best case scenario. 

I've been wanting to share this with her but I feel like she's also very fragile and I dont want to hurt her feelings or make her feel worse about herself. 

I'm not sure how to talk to her about this. Or even, if my concerns are valid? Maybe they aren't and maybe neither her or I have anything to be concerned about. Im not sure.

In some aspects God has really given us a stage, a stage on which to perform. And I think that how this play comes out is really up to us.*”

Alright, so. I'm a 19-year old woman. (Woman, ech.. I don't like calling myself that, and you'll soon see how hypocritical that is on my part) I've always had difficulty with my identity, I dress and act generally masculine, but nowadays don't mind dressing feminine and acting so. I briefly thought I was trans on around 8th grade  (around 15 years of age) then I thought I was genderfluid, then a demiboy. By the time I was 17 I had given up on trying to put a label on myself, cause it wasn't really that pressing or relevant in my life what I identified as.   


I recently had a chat with my sister, who is trans (And I love her so very much, I know you stalk my reddit, so I know you'll see this. Sis loves you) where we ended up talking back and fourth about how I don't like being called a woman or a girl, and how i'd much rather be a weird genderless forest alien creature than a real person. She ended up calling me an nonbinary ""egg"" referencing your community's term of... a trans person who hasn't realized they're trans yet? I think.   


Now, the problem is that... I don't really believe nor like nonbinary identities. Its probably some biast I picked up from old internet friends, who turned out to be shitty. Or its an opinion I formed myself, and refuse to have my mind changed about. I've seen way way too many of those purposely weird quirky and annoying nonbinary folks, so the whole concept skeeves me out. I really don't need more reason for people to think i'm weird and trying to be special. I just don't want to bother people with my identity that at the end of the day doesn't even matter. We'll all be same bones and dust at the end.   


Of course I know that most nonbinary people aren't that way, and most just wanna, like, use they/them pronouns and go on with their life like everyone else.   


I don't know what to do, and this has been bothering me since that age of 17 when I stopped figuring what I am. Not to a terrible degree, and I don't really mind which sex i'm viewed as but internally it bothers me.   


If anyone has absolutely anything to say please do. I'll be replying, I promise to be respectful even if you identify with a title I don't ""like"" or understand. Its your identity, and you deserve to be proud of it.

2020-11-01 17:15:02,jm5w5i,5,1,"Hey everyone! First time posting here, anywhere on reddit actually. I am currently on day 5 I believe of recovering from my top surgery! I am super pumped about becoming more of who I know I am in my heart and mind. 
So obviously I am an AFAB person and I identify as nonbinary. When my haircut is styled in a masculine way I pass a good bit of the time as male. The other day I scarred a little kid in the women’s restroom, prompting her mother and grandmother to wonder aloud if they were in the correct bathroom and give me dirty looks. I don’t feel comfortable in the men’s as I don’t want to be assaulted or get yelled at or anything but I also don’t want to make women uncomfortable or feel unsafe! Being a victim of SA myself, I would never want to make someone else feel unsafe even knowing that I am not and never would be a threat. 
My question is, after getting top surgery and in theory appearing more masc than before, which bathroom do I use? I try to avoid it as much as possible but sometimes life happens. Any feedback or personal stories would be super appreciated!! 
Hope you all have a wonderful day,

I had some questions about HRT and I thought you guys would be fit to clarify some of my doubts about it.

So here it goes:

•Does HRT make you get wider hips? If so, how many months until a change happens? (I heard there something about bone structure involved or something)
•Does it slow or removes facial hair? If so, how much time it takes to make effect?
•Can I just buy them and take them without having medical stuff involved?
•Can it cause ""unwanted side effects""?

I don't want to encroach on your space, but I wanted to get some insight from you lovely trans folx (I'm cis and my trans acquaintances are mutual friends with the person im trying to surprise!). 

I just started an etsy shop making goth wood slice ornaments (no, this isn't me advertising) and a lovely newer friend bought a bunch as soon as she saw me post! I wanted to gift her an extra ornament honoring her young trans son in some way! They've had a rough year - on top of covid, my friend had to go no contact with her mom because she refused to respect his pronouns, etc, after a long, strained relationship AND he's been having trouble getting the adults in his life (he lives with his dad a few hours away) to prioritize his transition and health. So this kid, somehow, still manages to get up and live his life everyday despite being young and trans in this nutjob of a world, dealing with puberty and just being 13/14, not having adults who are enthusiastic in their support, and having a grandma who literally would rather not have him in her life than just show some respect for his existence. This kid is a freaking superhero! 

I've never gotten a chance to meet him since he doesnt live with his mom, but I want to make an ornament for him. Do any of you have any suggestions or ideas? I only have black and white as far as paints and since it's an ornament, I don't have a huge amount of space to work with! Or..am I being intrusive?

2020-11-02 14:03:48,jmnxju,0,1,"October 2019 was the most depressed I've ever been. I don't want to get into it, but I wasn't ok. I was dying. A large part of that was my anxiety and dysphoria over my gender, which was hurting worse than it ever had. I needed an outlet, some semblance of relief.

On Halloween I was a walking shell. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I didn't want to do anything. Other people were making plans, going out, drinking, and everything you'd expect from a group of university students. But I couldn't. 

I still don't know what possessed me to do it, but I needed to do something that day. So I picked up my phone. I texted a friend. We had been close friends, but had drifted somewhat apart. That's ok, that's what life does. We hadn't spoken or seen each other in a while, but I still trusted them with everything I am.

I texted my friend: ""I think I might be trans.""

This was a lie. I didn't think, I knew. I'd always known, but to all the world I'd never shown any sign, never said anything. I was pre-everything, and aside from getting a little too invested in arguments about trans rights and gender recognition, there would be no reason to believe that I wasn't comfortable with my assigned gender. I can't state enough how much I had buried myself in the closet.

My friend was as amazingly accepting and supportive as anyone could ask for, even if this was a shock. We texted back and forth on and off that day, no big conversations, but small acknowledgements. For the first time in a long time I felt something. I was able to cry, I was able to smile. I slept that night, the first night in far too long.

But after the rush of energy from finally letting the weight I'd been carrying all my life off my chest, I felt bad. I felt guilty. How could I be so selfish, to dump my problems on someone else like they were nothing? How dare I bulldoze my way through my friends day and bury them under a mountain of my emotions, that they never asked for? I felt sick with myself. In many ways I still do.

I've seen that friend since. Honestly I was dreading that first meeting after that incident. I couldn't bear to look my friend in the eye after treating them so unfairly. When we met, it was if nothing had changed between us. They were the same they had always been. But I was different. I wanted to scream an apology for what I'd done, but I didn't say anything. I wore a fake smile and pretended I'd never done anything. I couldn't bring myself to even acknowledge what I'd confessed to them, and we never spoke of it.

And that was how it was for months. Everytime we saw each other there were others around. I could never find a moment to have a real heart to heart. So we didn't, and pretended that things were like they always were. At times I couldn't tell whether they even knew, or had forgotten what I'd done. Every time I saw that person, I felt a dagger in my heart, reminding me that I was awful, and didn't even have the decency to apologize.

We did eventually have a real talk (aided by the great equaliser alcohol) where it all came out. Tears, laughs and smiles. I'll never forget that.

But now it's a year later, and I'm feeling horrible again. I can't help but be reminded of what I did, how unfairly and selfishly I acted. I still feel pangs of pain everytime I'm with that person. I'm still pre-everything, still in the closet to the rest of the world, feeling like an impostor in my own skin. It still hurts.

I'm sorry for how ridiculously long this post is. I know no one will read this far, but I needed to write something down. I intended to put my thoughts into words on Halloween, 1 year later, but it was too raw. If you have read this far, I'm sorry for taking up your time.

Putting everything that is truly most important of what makes me, Me, to the side. Its all needed. Its all apart of my journey. I could never admit this to myself, or even find the reason why I was allowing myself to do this. As I said though, now that I have got to this point today where I am sharing this, I Am still On this Continuous Day 2 Day Journey of Healing.  
Its ok to be numb, Its ok to run away from how you feel, Its ok to focus on your passion while pushing everything else down. Its all meant for our Journey, separately.

I have 2 solutions:

A:
Take the tell and drape it over your shoulders and use a clip to secure it and if you want to secure it more, hold it by the bottom so now you’re a mysterious hooded figure who is the banisher of any insecurities

B:
Take a fluffy gown and dry yourself with the towel and then wear the gown so now you’re a huge fluff ball of perfection
Because that’s what you are,perfect.

2020-11-03 00:25:48,jmzyg5,2,1,"Hi Everyone - short-time lurker here, I felt this was important to post before the rest of this week happens. 

This year, I started exploring my gender dysphoria. It's one of my earliest memories, and shaped my early life in a lot of ways, but I didn't really let myself process it until this year (29yo). Part of that is due to my family just not being very expressive about anything, and me having to learn that as an adult. Part of it is due to huge expectations for my career. Part was having to, as an adult, work through sexual abuse that happened when I was a teen. But now, I've not only put a name to what I've felt, but also been able to explore what place these feelings have in my life. This sub has been one of the many resources helpful in that regard. 

I also consider myself somewhat conservative. If you get to this part and downvote/report/etc, I understand, and I don't hold it against anyone. I'm not a Trump fan at all (just couldn't vote for him), but also not a Biden fan, and generally lean more conservative on a lot of issues. While that's led to me not being charged up or anxious about this week, I understand that is not the case for most people here.

Just wanted to say that in exploring my own dysphoria, I've so far realized a small taste of what y'all have been battling in your lives. I don't know where my gender dysphoria will take me. There's a good chance I might stay in the closet. There's a chance I might be open about my dysphoria without transitioning, and I'll never deny the small chance that I might eventually transition. I just don't know right now. 

But regardless of what happens for me, I want you to know that I have a new appreciation for how tough and brave you are. And regardless of where I fall politically, I want to make things better for you. Right now it seems like a contradiction, even to me, but I refuse to believe that things can't change.

2020-11-03 01:54:41,jn1hd5,4,1,"Good night everyone.
I'm in a big moment of confusion.
I know most of you guys don't believe in AGP so I'll make what I mean with this term clear.
I'm, from what I think I know, a cisgender straight male who happens to also be sexually aroused to his own image as a woman. You can be AGP as a cis man, cis woman, trans man or trans woman, it has nothing to do with gender.
I hope I'm not offending anyone with this term as I'm honestly only seeking help right now, so please, be kind. 
I've had this as part of my sexuality since I was a child, from what I can remember and comprehend from my memories I've never had gender dysphoria until MAYBE yesterday, I'm 20 years old by the way. 
It's like I have two identities, I would find myself handsome if I had a strong masculine body but I would feel bad if I didn't have a feminine cute body because I wouldn't feel atractive by my AGP. 
I've been working out a bit, yesterday I looked at the mirror and I saw that my body is more masculine than it used to and it made me feel bad and I believe it's only because my AGP has been high these last days, I've been fantasizing about living my life as a woman the whole day today and I don't know how sexual this is being for me honestly, I'm really not sure as I'm not even hard while having these thoughts. I've always had this sense of beauty for women and feminity and not in a sexual way.

Now I’d you look beyond the black and white statement and look deeper into the nuance of what he is saying, he is saying that they are transformers because they are biologically achieving something that humans could not achieve before. It is really incredible, and thus the trans community deserves a positive recognition to be referred to as transformers.

2020-11-03 21:28:04,jnj9he,0,1,"(Posting this on all lgbt subreddits I know of)

First off, everyone has a particular preference and those are equally valid. 

If a gay man doesn't want to date a trans man that doesn't make him transphobic its just a preference.

If a lesbian doesn't want to date a trans woman that doesn't make her transphobic its just a preference.

Everybody is free to have any preferences they want to have, just because somebody asks a gay man/lesbian woman to see a trans man/trans woman as a man/woman that doesn't mean they're asking them to sleep with them.

Me personally, I am a trans woman and I'm straight (attracted to men) and while I would have no problem in dating a man who is cis or trans, I do realize that I'm a minority. But regardless, if I don't feel attraction for a pre op trans man I just tell that to him and be clear about it.

Why would I want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't want to be with me in the first place? Like that doesn't make sense.

The myth that trans people force gay people with the threat of ""transphobia"" to sleep with them is just that a myth.

This myth is creating a strain in between the gay and trans community and has been purposely planted by others who wish to separate the community apart.

We should work towards solving and debunking this myth.

Now there's another thing I've observed that I really don't like though. People getting bullied for being okay with dating trans pepople. 

Few people question my ""straightness"" when I say that I won't have a problem dating a trans man. I've even observed this in queer circles. People start questioning gay men and lesbians on their gayness which is ridiculous because trans men are men and trans women are women. So me having no problem dating a trans man/cis man doesn't magically make me gay. I'm a straight girl.

A lesbian dating a trans woman doesn't magically make her straight, she's a lesbian.

A gay man dating a trane man doesn't magically make him gay, he's a gay man.

Of course the majority might not have a preference but that doesn't mean that the minority who don't mind should be shamed for it that's just stupid.

As I said again all those rumours about trans people forcing cis gay people to sleep with them are just propaganda spread by hateful people who don't want to accept trans people and so they aim to divide the LGBT community by planting this seed of confusion. I don't want the LGBT community to get divided over this :(

Accepting trans men as men and trans women as women DOES NOT mean that anyone gay (or even straight) is being forced to date them. It is harmful to assume that and just creates unnecessary rift. Nobody is being bullied in the LGBT community to date trans people if they don't want to. (In fact it usually happens the other way around in my experience)

This article could be a good read about this unnecessary rift.

So, I've been best friends with this girl since I was 12. I'm now 20. 
We met well before my transition. I didn't come out till 16. When I came out to her she was over the moon. Super excited (she's strait by the way). She has a boyfriend of 7 years and I have a boyfriend too (I'm bi). I have thought in the past that I was in love with her a couple times and just shook it off. But, her and I are going on a 3 day fancy holiday next weekend and I realised that I wouldn't really want to do that with my boyfriend. That made me think. 
This friend and I have slept in the same bed a fair few times (in a platonic way) and once when we were drunk she confessed that she always looks at me and thinks about me. I confessed how I felt about her and we intensely made out. If my boyfriend wasn't over, I think it would have gone alot further. 
I just don't know what to do. I love her more then anybody and I can't talk to anyone about it. I don't think I'm even in love with my boyfriend but he is good for me as he is sensible and stable.

Firstly, I want to clarify that this isn’t saying that it’s not okay to be angry if Trump wins. You have every right to be furious. Scream, cry, do what you need to to get it all out. Don’t let anyone tell you that it’s immature or dramatic. These are our lives on the line. Anyone can dismiss our concerns as unfounded, but, as painful as is it is to admit, for many of us that’s simply not true.

This has been on my mind watching and waiting for the election results to come in. I’m exhausted at the prospect of another four years of this man. But I’m also secure in the terrifying prospect that we will be okay anyway. This community, these people, our very identities are not going anywhere. We will fight the same way we do day in and day out. It doesn’t matter if it’s with kind words to those in our community who need us or through throwing bricks and starting riots. We fight just the same. 

I say this to every person sitting in front of a TV or computer feeling fear creep in, it’s going to be okay. I know it’s a trope, and I don’t give a damn. I love you. I love this community. I am proud to be a part of this community. I’m afraid of what comes next, but I will stand in solidarity with every single one of you. I may be shaking, crying, and want nothing more than to run from the reality of being trans in this country right now. But I will stand next to you. I might not be able to do it for myself, but I will for you.

Someday we will be accepted again. Someday trans children will look in a history book and see our struggles as a far off reality they can barely imagine for the rights and acceptance they have had since day one. It may never be in our lifetime. It may be 10000 years from now. But as long as we keep fighting, it will come.

This man cannot stop us. We have been through hate, violence, and a never ending battle to simply be allowed existence. One person will not stop our community, any more than any other attempt to suppress us throughout history has. He can beat us down. We will not stop.

2020-11-04 07:33:06,jnsicb,1,1,"That was the sentence where I started crying tonight. 

For context, I'm 33 years old, transfem, pre-anything-medical, and semi-closeted (most of my friends and my mother know, but I'm still presenting masc at work).

It's been more or less a year since I started finally examining my feelings and my identity. As you might imagine, the fact that I'm starting this old is a point of no small frustration for me, and the state of the country has not been helping.

I had been trying not to obsess over news about the election, but I still found myself checking fairly frequently. As a result I found myself venting my frustrations to a couple of my friends over messenger apps. They tried to be helpful or at least understanding, and one of them made the comment ""you will survive this"".

I've been surviving for 33 years. Surviving to me means nothing more than paying my rent and being able to afford food and bills. And part of surviving until last year has been ""convincing myself I'm a guy so that I can keep my head down and make ends meet"". As of this last year, it has been ""pretend I'm still a guy on my work days so that I can keep paying my bills"".

With the election looking as bleak as it does right now, I'm scared that won't be enough. That things will continue to deteriorate, and that I won't be safe even going outside as myself. That any resources I might seek out for a full transition - planned parenthood, name changes, a new job, whatever - won't be available to me before long.

So when I was later venting about how scary this political landscape is, the only way I could phrase that feeling was ""I don't want to go back to being who I was just to survive"". And typing that out hit hard.

I guess I'm just posting that whole thing here because I needed to explain that somewhere. To type it out and toss it into the digital sea, as it were.

So I've been running circles in my head trying to figure this out for a weeks now. This first started after I had thoughts of wanting to be more feminine in terms of acting and what not, in which my brain couldn't figure out of that meant trans or just wanted to try crossdressing.

So I've been running a couple tests amomg several online groups I'm in, where I've asked them to use feminine pronouns for me and they did, and I got this strange sense of joy (It's kind of hard to describe the feeling)

Anyways I've been a lot more comfortable going by feminine pronouns but it can feel that seed of doubt being planted inside of my head even though the thought changed from ""Is this crossdressing or being trans"" to ""I want to be treated more like a girl"", and with that thought I decided to fully embrace feminine pronouns online 

Just few notes:
1.I haven't conducted any of these tests irl. Really the only thing I've done irl is starting to shave my body

2. I have consider possibly being gender fluid but that didn't exactly feel right 

Any advice? Do I ignore the doubt? Do I rethink this over again?

1 New Thing A Day? A constant state of uncomfortableness. Is Being Uncomfortable actually what is true to Us? To Me?

Is Fear though, the sense of self judgement? Judgment from what others will think of me? Why do we care about everyone else's opinion, when 97% of the people that we are fearing are not around us, nor even connected to us?   
Everyone is living with their own fears.  
What is so Scary? Why is it that once we act upon our fears, or speak to ourselves about what has been allowing us to stay still, coasting through life, that the fears are alleviated and we move on like it never affected us prior?

Found out young, **One** did not belong.

Light snuffed out, must abide.

A tunnel endless, made of pain and shame.

**He** walked, maybe *she* was gone?

Looking for redemption, finding none.

&amp;#x200B;

**He** walked through life, *she* still outside.

New starts, bad endings, broken hearts

Tried to be free, but ran to hide.

A sea to drown in, no message in the bottle.

**He** walked, maybe *she* was gone?

Looking for meaning, never done.

&amp;#x200B;

**He** walked through life, *she* now in his mind.

A tiny light, breaking through the wall of spite.

**He** met Another, She was sweet and kind.

Crawling out of the cave, evolution goes slowly.

***They*** walked together, no longer alone.

Not quite there yet, but *she* feels at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Parallel worlds, **body** and *mind*.

Slowly merging, becoming one of a kind.

No harmony there, **One** has to get out.

Trying to express, but can't find the route.

Afraid of *her*, of losing the Other.

A love wanted and needed, but only when given.

Tentatively measuring, finding *her* courage.

*She* has to come out, *she* wants Her acceptance

The Other, the love, redemption, heart racing.

Now running wild, *her* evolution is changing.

I’m wondering what everyone’s feelings are on trans people that participate in the crossdressing and sissy communities. I know it’s a bit controversial, particularly sissies, but if they ID as trans that matters, doesn’t it?

Her views are unclear to me but the way she treats other people from the lgbt community makes it decently clear. There used to be a gay guy at her work and she would just say ‘the gay guy’ and every sentence to do with him brought up the fact he was gay. Secondly, one time i was speaking to her and I can’t remember the circumstances but I remember her saying ‘ya not gay r ya? One time i used makeup for halloween one year to pale my face a bit and then she would use that in arguments against me, that was the last time i dressed up. So her views are decently unclear to me.

Fast forward to tonight i was sat on the couch dressed up 6 hours after she left, and i’m doing some college work on the laptop. A car pulled in, i check every car just incase out of paranoia. And what do you know it was her on our drive way. I tossed the wig halfway across the room behind the couch. Luckily I didn’t have much makeup on just foundation so i could get away with that. She comes in and my heart is pounding still. She puts her coat away which is directly where i through the wig but luckily she didn’t notice. She takes my little brother up to bed and i take the wig, and stuff it in my draw (it’s basically fucked now). So she goes to bed because its late and now i’m sat here pondering over the situation.

And he’s expressed to me before that he doesn’t care what i do. 
I think its worth to note that i have no desire to take hrt or get surgery its just something i like to do.

So I have no idea what to expect she will think when I tell her.

I live with my mom and she misgenders me daily so I would feel more comfortable if I didn't have to hide something so fundamental about myself.

I feel that she is capable of coming around and understanding me as a woman. I just am afraid of how bumpy a road it may be to get her there. What steps can I take to inform her more about trans people before or during my coming out? And how would you / did you do it?

Getting away was something I needed for myself, to be on my own, to be accountable for myself (in some degree), to be just me, without no one else by my side.

No matter how beautiful he is, he still just...isn’t comfortable as a man and wishes he was born as a woman. He even admitted to being super sad because he could never be pregnant and be a mother. I don’t want to assume because of this that he’s trans because I am not in his brain, but to me, it really seems like it.

Despite that I think it’s important to explain what lead me to ponder this question.

First of all I was kind of raised in very female setting not in my home life (that was fairly normal and my parents are great) for example I spent years doing dance, sure that’s not exclusive to women and girls I know but when you are young and talking dance classes you do end up being the only boy in that performance (looking back now even subconsciously I must of felt that I was different to them I where dancing with.)

A few years later when I moved to high school I did drama both inside and outside of School and had a blast yet some times those feelings came back as to why I had to be so different to my “female” best friend I had around me.

This got worse through tout high school as I never had any friends let alone ones who would see or tolls to me outside of school they were mostly nothing more than acquaintances.

That all change In The final year when I met a large group of female friends.

They when some of the only friends that I ad I would sit and talk to them about everything we would talk about boys,sex,periods amongst other things you probably wouldn’t talk about with a boy in the room let alone have him be active in the conversation.they even made impacts on my life like I tried shaving a bit of my leg for a time and even started listening to Taylor Swift and doing some other female characteristics that I still do today. I would literally spend all my time at school with their wonderful people.

Despite me being treated as one of the girls I wasn’t 🥺 they got to wear skirts and dresses to school and prom,I didn’t even get to wear shorts,they could all go to the bathroom together and I couldn’t and when it came to doing sports I had to go and play soccer on the muddiest field you have ever seen whilst they got to do dance ,gymnastics and trampolining.

That’s why I relay want to go to collage not because I want to study there no it’s because it will give me the chance to experiment instead of just trying on my moms make up and clothes that don’t fit I can get that stuff delivered to my dorm room even if that makes me just a cross dresser and not trans at lest I would know more about myself and nobody did anything wrong by playing a bit of dress up and becoming a princess now did they ?

2020-11-08 22:33:12,jql634,6,1,"Hello all,

I recently made a post to this community about some topics and I appreciate all of the responses I was able to look through. However, I would like to discuss something else (Autogynephilia) and what I should do essentially. (I understand no one here can give me a definite answer or path to take and that I need to figure that out for myself, rather, I would like to get some clarity on how I feel about my gender, and if it associated with Autogynephilia or not) This post will probably be pretty long so let me just apologize in advance haha. 

I'm currently 17 years old but early in childhood (around 4 years old) I didnt really feel a disconnect with my gender, however I remember a distinct moment of my life of 4 year old me asking myself ""Why cant I just be a girl?"" And for some reason, it really bothered me. In preschool I had a few times where I was fascinated with dresses and the ""girls"" costumes. I always asked the teachers if I could wear one of the princess costumes and I did. I remember being shoved into a corner, and being harassed and ridiculed by all the other students. Maybe my brain is falsely telling me this but I remember it. It really bothered me and made me feel like Im not supposed to present the way I wanted to. And that I was supposed to present a certain way because im just a ""guy"". Fast forward a few years im probably what? 5 or 6? and me and my mother are over the neighbors. All of their children were girls, and we were playing tag and what not downstairs and then makeup came into play. We all started applying stuff like blush and, errr.. all the powdered stuff? (haha sorry I dont know too much about makeup) and I enjoyed it, but I certainly remember thinking ""ah my mothers gonna be so mad that Im wearing makeup"". I felt weird using it. And I dont know if it was because I thought my mother would be mad or what but other than that I really enjoyed the experience. This also happened another time out near the pool where we all painted each others nails. Im sure youre all thinking its just a phase from that point on, and youre probably right, because my thoughts of my gender identity and being a girl vanished from 4 years old until I was 12. 

When I was 12 I started becoming attracted to girls (Im bisexual now and have explored this to its fullest potential) And for some reason, my mind just kept on questioning. I didnt ""feel"" like a woman, or ill reword and say I acted nothing like a woman. I acted like your stereotypical pre teen boy transitioning into manhood. But for some reason my mind presented the idea that I need to be a female. That I need to be a girl, that its something I want and need. (This is extremely similar to autogynephilia from what ive apparently heard). Every time I were (and still am) to look at a female presenting person, lets say walking down the street or what not. I get this mind numbing ""dysphoria"" in my head that makes me wish I could just be them, along with your stereotypical teenage sexual imaging. (No I was not being perverted, and no I do not have perverted tendencies). Every time I look at someone female presenting and find them to be attractive I immediately want to be them. Or to have those qualities. But at the same time I could never imagine myself pleasuring myself to the idea of myself having feminine traits that I admire. And this still holds true today. I love the idea of using makeup at the age of 17. I just deep down, feel the urge to just want to splurge out on making myself feel and look female presenting, (makeup, dresses, generally ""girly"" attire). I have never once looked at a feminine picture of myself in the mirror, and felt sexually pleased by it. However, I just act like a guy, you know? my personality. And what not. 

So from here you can already tell, that yeah. Im probably an autogynephile. My body hair doesnt bother me, but some times, it does. My genitals dont bother me, however I have stopped ""Self pleasuring"" because for some reason, im hoping to god that I dont have Autogynephilia, because deep down I want to be a real woman, but remember. its a *want* not a need or feel. I dont *feel* like a woman but I want to be female so bad that I *feel* like a woman. I have actively engaged in self harm in the past because I didnt want to be a man anymore, I wanted to be female. In the past I was just easily able to ""Self pleasure"" all of those thoughts away, but 10 or 15 minutes later they always came back. I cant stand the thought of being a man the rest of my life, but if I could just get rid of these thoughts of wanting to be female and having a deep connection to wanting to dress feminine and present as a female if probably live fine. When I was 12 I told my mother I was transgender and she told me its just ""not me"" that I dont act like a woman, She says im the most boyish person she knows. So I cant possibly be transgender at heart right? Im just an autogynephile. years ago I remember being turned on by wearing feminine clothing, which basically seals it, I am an autogynephile. Im not actually transgender, and that disheartens me greatly. However, I still cant imagine living as a man, I just cant, it bothers me. I feel discusted, and feel like a sexually charged monster. 

I guess my question to all of you is. Do I sound like an autogynephile? What should I do? Should I actively engage in transitioning to end this mental anguish? I understand almost everything about how transitioning works and the steps id have to take, and I get so excited mentally about the idea of surgeries and hormones to help me get rid of the mental pain.

2020-11-08 22:34:24,jql6u8,2,1,"i am a 15-year old transgender male, and have identified that way for the past 4 years. recently, though, i’ve been having doubts about my gender and general identity. i know it is normal for my age but i still want to open up to people who might be able and willing to help and listen.

i had my first appointment that was fully focused on my gender, and to my disappointment it didn’t lead to much anything and i have to go back there in a year, once i turn 16.

i have always been mostly androgynous, and i don’t really worry about whether i present as feminine, masculine or something in between. rather, i have started to occasionally feel as i want to present myself as female, not just feminine but female. i am a nonbinary skeptic and haven’t even considered it due to how skeptic i am over it, and that i’m uncomfortable with they/them pronouns, but my female-or-male choice is a mystery to myself.

i feel as if i want to live a two-sided life, where i occasionally dress and present myself as a female, and most of the time as a male. i don’t know what i am, i feel like most likely i am just an androgynous male, but it’s hard to know as sometimes my dysphoria goes away and i don’t like the thought of being nonbinary or ”genderfluid” either. drag could be an option, the oversexualization and hyperfemininity of it just kinda scares me and i’m not so into going for such a strong female look, more something casual. what should i do? is this normal, does it seem like i could still be trans or am i cis in denial?",trans,"ongoing, sudden identity crisis",1604900064.0,"{'created_utc': 1604874864, 'id': 'jql6u8', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'i am a 15-year old transgender male, and have identified that way for the past 4 years. recently, though, i’ve been having doubts about my gender and general identity. i know it is normal for my age but i still want to open up to people who might be able and willing to help and listen.\n\ni had my first appointment that was fully focused on my gender, and to my disappointment it didn’t lead to much anything and i have to go back there in a year, once i turn 16.\ni have felt comfortable with my life, how i get called with my chosen name by everyone i use, people see me as male, i introduce myself as a dude and so on. i occasionally have huge bursts of dysphoria where i feel disgusted towards my female parts and feel anxiety because tight clothing might show my feminine figure. i have, ever since i realized i was trans, wanted masectomy and testosterone. my mental health has had huge changes from normal (3 years ago) to slowly worsening to a very bad state, but i have not once changed my mind on my identity.\n\ni have always been mostly androgynous, and i don’t really worry about whether i present as feminine, masculine or something in between. rather, i have started to occasionally feel as i want to present myself as female, not just feminine but female. i am a nonbinary skeptic and haven’t even considered it due to how skeptic i am over it, and that i’m uncomfortable with they/them pronouns, but my female-or-male choice is a mystery to myself.\n\ni feel as if i want to live a two-sided life, where i occasionally dress and present myself as a female, and most of the time as a male. i don’t know what i am, i feel like most likely i am just an androgynous male, but it’s hard to know as sometimes my dysphoria goes away and i don’t like the thought of being nonbinary or ”genderfluid” either. drag could be an option, the oversexualization and hyperfemininity of it just kinda scares me and i’m not so into going for such a strong female look, more something casual. what should i do? is this normal, does it seem like i could still be trans or am i cis in denial?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'ongoing, sudden identity crisis', 'created': 1604900064.0}"

Hi all, for the past year I was dealing with accepting that I’m trans, and it’s only very recently that I’ve fully accepted it and came out to a few trusted people. 

Ever since coming out to myself, my I became a lot more aware of the things I usually was able to suppress. My dysphoria skyrocketed and I went from being an overachiever to not even being able to get out of bed.

I’m not able to start transitioning yet, because I’m still working up to coming out to my dad with my therapist. Not being able to transition makes everything look so far and unattainable, and I feel like I’ll never be valid or passing. It seems so close, yet infinitely far.

My days have been spiraling, and I usually wake up, look in the mirror, and don’t eat anything till 3 or 4 because I don’t want other people to see me. I try doing things like practicing voice, but that always makes me feel worse than when I started. When I get really dysphoric I just sleep it off, and this leads me to sleep almost all day. I’ll wake up hours after I go to sleep and don’t know if it’s night or day. I can’t commit to college work like I used to.

On most days I just hate everything about myself and can’t live with who I am. I know these coping mechanisms are very unhealthy, so I just want some advice on how I can deal with my dysphoria healthily, even if I can’t transition yet.

this would have been okay if i didnt want to be a girl so bad. i mean, i want to dress up, i want to talk about guys at sleepovers, i want to paint my nails, i want to wear female clothes, and skirts, god the skirts.

I have done laser on my entire upper body and in the holiday season bought a package for my legs. I am quite prone to in-growns ( big relief for my face, electrolysis and less hair there = less in-grown hairs and damage). 

I am moderately but not “very hairy.” I haven’t started hormones yet. Any advice re shaving and how to best go about it to prep for my first laser session? I am fanatical on face and neck / décolleté skincare, but I haven’t given my legs as much thought. 

My basic plan: Regular exfoliation for a few weeks, followed by good razors and shaving with attention to warm/cold water and moisturizing ? Repeat every few days to acclimate my skin and prevent major growth and discomfort until my next session ? Based on experience as a teen (now 37) I can imagine some real itchiness doing a 100% leg shave - but it is bliss while it lasts.

2020-11-09 07:00:55,jqsyur,2,1,"I’ve been questioning my identity for a good 2-3 years now. I first started back in like 2018, and it was all pretty new to me... I don’t even remember why I was questioning things originally. At the time I was kinda depressed, and I had attempted suicide. I didn’t necessarily have any obvious dysphoria, as in I’d never connected any of my issues to me being born male, and I’d never felt bad just because I was born a male. I had dressed in women’s clothes on several different occasions as a child, but I stopped doing it by the time I was going to elementary school at least. 

At some point i started joining LGBT+ communities online, though not because I thought I was trans, just because I was bi. I still hadn’t questioned things yet but I was hearing other people’s stories, and kinda educating myself about the trans community. Somewhere along the line I started thinking that I may be trans, and that maybe my issues were a result of gender dysphoria, but I couldn’t really explain why if I was asked.

I came out to my mother and sister, but then at some point I started doubting myself. I had done all this in the span of 2-3 months, and I really wasn’t sure about it, so I just tried to ignore it. I stopped talking to my mom and sister about it, and hoped they’d forget as well. Of course, they didn’t, so anytime I was asked about it I’d just say I wasn’t comfortable talking about it.

This went on for about a year or two, until I started questioning things again. I had brought up what I did to some friends online, and that ended up motivating me to revisit my questions about my identity. I decided this time I’d really take time to process and think about things. I talked to some people online, specifically other trans people, but I found myself not being entirely accurate with my story, out of fear that I’d be dismissed or that people just wouldn’t think I’m trans. It was as if part of me really wanted me to be trans, but I didn’t think I really was. 

Eventually, I resolved to get a therapist. We talked about it, multiple times, but I never made any progress. Most recently I’ve explained to him that I honestly don’t know if I’m trans, and I may very well be cis, and he told me simply that it’s ok not to know. I guess I went in expecting him to tell me whether or not I was trans, but that was unrealistic. I recently detransitioned on twitter, and told everyone I was actually cis, because I was seriously doubting my identity, but I was going through some posts in trans communities recently that made me think maybe I am trans... I’m not sure how to explain it, but it’s kinda like I feel more trans when I’m talking to or hearing about other trans people.

The main thing that’s lead me to believe I could be trans recently is just a feeling that I’d be happier as a woman, as well as a certain feeling of euphoria I sometimes get when I imagine myself as a woman. I’m still as unsure as ever, and I don’t really know how I can ever be sure about these things. It seems to me like most trans people are sure from the beginning, or at least have some sense of knowing that they’re trans, (not trying to generalize of course, just what I’ve seen mostly) while my time question my identity has mostly just been filled with unending uncertainty. 

I’m not even too sure why I made this post... maybe because I’m looking for someone to assure me that I really am trans, or maybe so someone can explain to me why I must be cis. Or maybe just so I can find someone’s who’s as unsure as me.

I recently came to the realization that I am a boy (fluid as I be), but I’ve been spiraling ever since. I go to work as a “female” teacher, I walk around in public, and suddenly I think to myself “No, I’m not unhappy. Do I wish I were born a man? Often, yes. But I’m not unhappy as I am. I LIKE existing as a femme.” But I’m still aggressively binding my chest, I’m still dressing relatively masc, I often wish I had a male voice, people perceived me as male, or that I were born a man. But maybe it’s just wishful thinking, and I’m a femme who subconsciously knows it would be easier in many ways to align with masculinity.

I love a lot of kinds of pretty, femme clothing. Honestly I don’t really LIKE men. They have hurt and disappointed me over and over again. The thought of someone calling ME a man disgusts me in a lot of ways. But as soon as I “realized” I told everyone, compulsively. I NEEDED to tell them that I was a “boy.” (“Man” just felt threatening, even though I am a young adult.)  Now, a week later, I feel like I’ve made it up. 

I feel euphoric when I look in the mirror and see a boyish, Cavetown-esque person. I enjoy looking femme sometimes, but looking back, I’ve always had chest dysphoria. It’s been worse, or at least more noticeable, lately.

Essentially, I’m asking when you felt confident, when you knew that a change (like starting HRT)  was right for you. Did you spiral? Did you have doubts? Or are my doubts a sign that I’m being totally delusional? I just want to be happy and feel like I’m making the right decisions.

Hi, I’m new to posting here but I’ve found this group really helpful in coming to terms with who I am. I am a 31 year old transgender woman. It still feels weird to say out loud, but I’ve known for about 15 years now. I always had feminine thoughts and feelings and a tendency to prefer girl toys, which for the most part we’re always really accepted by my family and friends. I eventually came out as gay, and went the drag route for many years. I have been mostly quarantining alone with my dog and cat, with occasional visits from friends and family to social distance outdoors. I am out of work ( I was in cosmetics pre pandemic), and don’t have car insurance so I don’t get out much. All this time alone has left me with my thoughts and dreams of becoming who I feel I am inside. After months of hiding away all of my feminine items and not wearing makeup or wigs, I realized how very much in denial I was. I was finally on my own, with the freedom to be in true form every day if I wanted, but I didn’t. Until a few weeks ago. I realized it was my life, and I was the one who had to live it. And I couldn’t do that as a boy. I have a small circle now, but the few people are long term friends who are supportive and a Mom who loves me very much. I came out to my best friend who also feels they are like me, but has no plans to pursue it. Then another friend. And another. And a cousin who I’m close with. After the election results, and when Joe Biden mentioned transgender folks in his speech, I was so moved I also came out to my Mom. 

Everyone has said they support me, worry about my safety, and all have a lot of questions. I have answered what I can, and have been really grateful they still accept me. I don’t take that lightly at all, as I know many of us don’t get that. However, the actions they’ve been showing speak much more. I feel so isolated and like they don’t even realize how huge this is. I am trying to be understanding that 2020 has been so difficult for everyone, and I know each person has their own stress, struggles, and situation. I just feel a general lack of empathy towards me and I don’t think any of them realize the struggle I am going through. I am terrified that it’s out there. It can’t be taken back now. I’m worried about the future, therapy, hormones, surgery, etc. and I thought at least some would understand and maybe check in more or just be a bit more gentle? I almost regret it, now I feel like a burden or something and not that I want special treatment but they’re still just unloading their stress on me and barely considering the fact I just came out to them and am embarking on a super hard journey. I’m quite the empath and so none of this is new; but I just thought I would feel different and I’m just really disappointed. 

I know the road ahead is long and lonely, but I’m hoping anyone could share any tips or resources for this. It’s really lonely and the thoughts of feeling not enough or less than are already a staple, but now I just feel almost even more odd with even my closest loved ones. I feel like I’m making excuses by blaming election stress, covid stress, general 2020 stress, but I try to remind myself I have all of that too, yet I still came out and decided to be authentic. It wasn’t easy and now it’s just overwhelming and I could use some good advice, or just a supportive friend. 

Thank you so much if you read this. I’ve never really written a journal entry online and it’s scary, but reading all of your stories inspired me to take this step, so thank you 🙏🏻

Complicating matters is that I've grown up so far in the middle of the woods, with a physiologically and mentally compromised mother, such that I've been unable to actually *have* social interactions, at all, outside the Internet, other than a few times I went out for a mandatory thing like vaccinations or state testing.

Why is it that when we as a society have a passion for something we are so quick to think of what to do, or maybe the first moves but it takes so long sometimes for the action to come in place? Why do we care about other peoples opinions so much that it allows us to stand still? Instead of trying, either being successful with our idea, or learning what we liked about that said focus, what we didn't and what we can do better next time.

I believe truly that when the Knowing tells you what your next move should be, FOLLOW IT. Remove the need of thinking about your friends, family, guardian, partner, acquaintances etc. They aren't you and most definitely you aren't them. Why Worry?

If you want to start a business, Start. If you want to use your voice to make change in the world, Start. If you want to start doing yoga outside in the park, Start. If you want to write a book, Start. If you want to dance in the rain, Start. More importantly, DO. Act on what you feel is right for you.

We have 1 life. 1 chance with many chances to learn, fail (learn), grow, evolve and be our true authentic self by becoming fearless.

Fearlessness is not the fact that you don't fear things, but even though the fear has come into your eyesight, you still PERSEVERE. IT feels good as well. The pain, the fear, of yourself, societies ""judgment"", the unknown, can be scary, but the most beautiful part of life is that when YOU follow through, YOU do what YOU know is right for YOU, You will look back and say to yourself, ""I was scared of doing that?"" and laugh. With Happiness and Empowerment that you have started your Journey, which we ARE ALWAYS ON........ but thats a conversation for another day.

Today: Start. Do 1 thing that you have always told yourself YOU wanted to do. Make 1 move towards it. You are WELL on your way already. Its your TIME Now, to Begin or to Continue Working Hard on whatever it is that FUELS your Flame. Sister, I love you. I know you CAN.

2020-11-11 12:17:21,js73vs,9,1,"I am a 17 year old biological male, and I have been struggling with my gender identity for a long while now.

I guess the signs started when I was really young and got to play games like club penguin? Well, I remember insisting to choose a pink penguin for my avatar and giving myself a feminine username, ""Queen033"". This is not where it stopped though. In all other games where I got to pick my own character, I've always felt a natural inclination to pick female characters. This happened on social media sites as well, as some of you may already tell from my reddit username and avatar. Moreover, I always fuound myself liking traditionally girly stuff, like pink objects and stuffed animals. 

The signs got stronger when puberty came. I remember being traumatised by the sight of pubic hair and facial hair, and would often go to great lengths to conceal them. It wasn't so much that I found them ugly, it was just that I felt they weren't representative of how I was supposed to look like. At the same time, my voice started deepening and that made me really uncomfortable when speaking as well.

When I was 11 years old, I made a very strange request to my parents- I never wanted to wear tank tops again. At that time, I didn't know the reason why, but I just knew that I was not at ease when wearing tank tops, especially in public view. Now that I think about it, could it be because tank tops expose a part of my body and may conflict with my efforts to hide any signs of masculinity? A similar issue has popped up where I always feel uncomfortable if asked to go shirtless, and would always wear a full swimsuit when out swimming, which is uncharacteristic of most males my age.

At this point, I should probably also bring up that the main reason why I believe I may be transgender, instead of just a feminine man, is because I get uncomfortable when I get associated with males. For instance, I always feel sad and uneasy when people use male pronouns to refer to me. I also dislike it when people say that my handwriting is boyish :/

I'm here because i have a request. I'm a university student in Urbanism at Université du Québec à Montréal and i have a huge interest in the feeling of insecurity in urban contexts. I also recently discovered an interest in transppl related subjects. I've found very little stuff about the matters on internet.

I need to find any academic paper, news article, books and anything that could help me in my research on trans people experience with the city, neighborhood, geographic space, etc.
Even if it is somewhat... Hmm.. Peripherical and anecdotical :) i plan on doing a master and maybe a phd on the subject to help society and social science even though i want to have a bigger focus on insecurity feelings in cities :)

I realized to myself that I didn't want to allow the struggle to consume my Being, Mind &amp; Body Anymore. I Had Enough. Consuming Alcohol to numb the pain, numb myself, numb my identity. Smoking copious amounts over the past 7 years as well, made it very easy to push everything that was of value to me, further and further down, allowing me to run the other direction faster and faster.

It came to a point where I didn't feel right anymore. I wasn't happy, I didn't feel, I wasn't aware of my energy, I was blocking my own path with my constant self numbing that I was telling myself was ""Just For Fun"", but really had turned into a necessity and an addiction through my own little past times.

Celebration. Everyday we are so lucky to wake up. To open our eyes, to start a new day of opportunity and Life. Its amazing how I put opportunity first before Life, when Without Life there is no opportunity. We learn, we move forward. I have learned that when I have begun to accept how I feel, how I think, how I act fully and watching them instead of judging or dwelling, that the healing process comes naturally right after. It takes time and believe you me, I am just beginning my healing process.

Giving myself the love needed for myself day to day has allowed me to now want to be the best me possible. Through day to day Journaling, Meditation, Being Present in Nature, Going for Walks, Sharing time with Family and Friends as well as Focusing on my Creative, Healing and Happiness is Possible and It is for You too.

I love you.

I can be who I want to be,

I was always mummy’s little girl baby,

But maybe that’s not me, just maybe,

But now ‘boy’ is the title I have worn.



Growing up I never fitted in,

Nobody was like my twin,

With the boys I always went off and played football,

I never wanted a make-up haul,

I didn’t ever feel as if I could belong,

I always felt like I was wrong.

I previously made a post that trans people can be considered transformers. Well, I am not the only one who thinks this. President Vladimir Putin stated at the G20 that he believes that trans people are the human first transformers in our history. “They’ve thought up six or five genders – transformers, trans… I don’t even understand what it is myself.” (mygnews, 2019). Now I’d you look beyond the black and white statement and look deeper into the nuance of what he is saying, he is saying that they are transformers because they are biologically achieving something that humans could not achieve before. It is really incredible, and thus the trans community deserves a positive recognition to be referred to as transformers.

It takes Time. Something that I am Continuing to Learn is that the Process Takes Time. I Am always in the mindset of what has to be accomplished during the day that even if I am enjoying the Process, slowing down is what needed. It starts from the moment we Rise. As You. We are 1 of 1. We are Original. Irreplaceable.

Breathe. In. Breathe. Out. Enjoy this Day. Enjoy who You Are. Enjoy the Sunshine.

With the constant time we have been given during this quarantine, it can be very scary or even puts your mindset to rush. To accomplish. Move on to the next, or that everything is too much that it makes us pause and stop. Either or is ok. Either or is still apart of our Journey. The Journey takes all different ways of balancing work ethic, our Mental Health, how we want to move forward.

It starts with Presence. It starts with being in the moment. Everyday for at least 30 minutes I get some sort of exercise, some sort of time in Mother Nature and Being Surrounded by Mother Earth, to let the calmness and embrace the fresh air and Peace that is constantly surrounding that can be easily looked past due to these unprecedented times.

Social Media. A huge factor of changing the way I feel, act, think, Be. It is important to ensure that everyday I am taking time away for my own Peace and my own Well Being to make sure that I am focusing on my Self and Filling my Own Cup up, Rather than Emptying it onto Others. If There is no Marbles in the Jar for when I need them, how am I suppose to grab them? Anxiety, Depression, Lack of Presence, Lack of Self Identity, Lack of Being.

Today: Spend Time Outside. Spend Time away from your phone. Spend Time for You.

I love you.

So apparently in that other reality I'm out on HRT and have a boyfriend who I'm soon gonna marry. His name is kevin and he was just about to be discharged from the military. We live here in my hometown but it wasnt the hometown I know like the back on my own hand, it was sleightly different.

Now its night time and me and my boyfriend were on a ferry boat comming back from seattle (but not seattle). For some reason he takes a tumble over the side of the ferry boat. Now this is weird cause it wasnt like any ferry boats in washington state. 

So I'm waiting there at the terminal while the search goes on for him and I'm thinking to myself how if I wasnt afraid of deep water I would dive down too (I actually am afraid of deep water). I get the thought to call his best friend from the army to see if for some reason he got a hild of him (I was near hysterical, I dunno what that was supposed to do). 

This entire time in introducing myself as andrea and using my fem voice but it's the fem voice I would have if I practiced at it more than I do. So thanks to this reality warping dream I'm gonna be plagued with heavier than usual dysphoria and my day is shot.

So a little back story. Yesterday I (trans woman, 23) got an F on my driver's license, yay! So I had gender confirmation stuff in my head apparently.

So I have this dream I'm going to PA(USA) to get FFS. I get there and the woman doing it was super nice, but then she rubs something on my face then makes a few cuts, almost out of the blue. But they don't hurt because apparently the thing she rubbed on my face was an anesthetic. But a few cuts later my EYE COMES OUT WHILE IM STILL AWAKE! Neither of us say anything and a bit later she puts it back in. After that I'm napping and she comes in and is all worried and says I wasn't supposed to close that eye, when I tried to open it it was like gummed shut(think like in the matrix with Neo's mouth). So she goes in and cuts again and fixes it but it takes longer. After, I'm trying to not close that eye(she only did one side), and I look in the mirror and I see myself(never happens to me) and one side of my face is all messed up, almost like a skin graft after a bad burn. So I leave all freaked out before she can do the other side.

I go to some friends all freaked out and they basically tell my that it's fine and it looks good but I should go back and have her so the other side. I wasn't sure but they convinced me to go back and have the surgeon finish. So we all make our way out there. When we get back my bed was taken but there was another one open. She tells me that she had to use some experimental enzymes because I closed my eye the first time and that's why it was all messed up.

Then I woke up.

FFS has always been on my maybe list but I was always hesitant because some actual horror stories about it. It was such a strange dream to wake up remembering. I'm just not sure what to make of it.

Okay so, I'm a born male but I've always been a bit confused on this type of stuff for a while. I won't lie, i like female pronouns, female clothes, names, everything. And a part of me genuinely wants to be female. To the point I picked out a new name and everything (Kathrine if you're interested). You'd think it'd be an open and shut case right? Well maybe not. Sometimes I do feel like a guy, especially after I.... pleasure myself. It's like all the other feelings instantly go away after that and I suddenly feel like I was born the correct gender for the rest of that day and all of the next day (sometimes even longer). I know I'm not gender fluid or non binary or anything like that. 

Also I feel I should mention these last parts: I'm not what would be traditionally feminine besides maybe the way I talk sometimes if I'm not paying attention.

I won't lie, i like female pronouns, female clothes, names, everything. And a part of me genuinely wants to be female. To the point I picked out a new name and everything (Kathrine if you're interested). You'd think it'd be an open and shut case right? Well maybe not. Sometimes I do feel like a guy, especially after I.... pleasure myself. It's like all the other feelings instantly go away after that and I suddenly feel like I was born the correct gender for the rest of that day and all of the next day (sometimes even longer). I know I'm not gender fluid or non binary or anything like that. \n\nAlso I feel I should mention these last parts: I'm not what would be traditionally feminine besides maybe the way I talk sometimes if I'm not paying attention.

START NOW.\n\nWhat really worked for me when I began my creative journey was doing 1 thing a day towards my craft and knowing, thats progress. It then snowballs, Uphill. Work at it everyday. Don\'t say ""I don\'t have time"", when you are scrolling aimlessly on Instagram or Tik Tok watching balloon challenge videos. It takes time and we might as well use the time given while we are still here.\n\nHappiness. Self Fulfillment. Peace. Joy. Love for Life. Alleviation. Healing. Its Your Turn. Its Mine. Ours. Together. Separately. Start Today.\n\nI love you.\n\nDrey &lt;3\n\nSubscribe for Daily Blogs: [www.striclyspoken.com/blog](http://www.striclyspoken.com/blog)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7vlgz0dp1z51.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=058672ddce18f862292329217b668cb10a480e2a', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Daily Habits (32)', 'created': 1605315073.0}"

2020-11-13 22:57:13,jtqk3x,2,1,"I've written in my notes a text post that'll be posted to Facebook late at night when everyone is asleep, so when I wake up I can prepare for whatever a happens. Just thought I'd share it with all of y'all. Sorry if anything sounds cliché, but that's just what happened in my experience as a trans guy. Hope you enjoy:

People probably won't believe me when I say ""I've known ever since I was a child"", as they'll say ""You never showed any symptoms or signs, I don't think you are"". To that, I say whatever. You don't know the thoughts that have been circling through my head ever since I was young. You don't know me at all. And if you do, you're just in denial.
I've wanted short hair and disliked pink and girly things ever since I was about 10. I loved sports, especially football, and found myself befriending the only 9 boys that were in my class in primary school, of a class of about 31. I didn't specifically dislike the girls, but I didn't find anything they talked about or were interested in cool.
I discovered the term ""transgender"" when I was about 13. Some reading this will think ""Oh did you find that out on Tumblr?"". Surprisingly, no. I found the term before finding said website. I read everywhere of how supportive Tumblr was for LGBT people and quickly made an account. It's been about 6 years since I made my account, and I still use it daily to this day.
I didn't think I was transgender straight away. I was in denial and uncertain for a very long time, often jumping to labels like ""bigender"" and ""genderfluid"". I changed my preferred name and pronouns a lot too.
When I was in high school I made a good group of friends, all of them eventually coming out of the closet as LGBT (mostly bi and ace). I still didn't want people to know about my gender dysphoria and came out the worst and most incorrect way possible. I came out to my friends as a lesbian, girl attracted to girls. But I'm not a girl, but I didn't know if it was 100% safe to tell my friends that.
When college came I was still a lesbian. I soon realised that college kids are incredibly friendly and respectful. I told my friends that I was transgender and that I wanted to be called Oscar. It was a very hard, and anxious thing to do. I was relieved to know they supported to be and tried to call me Oscar and go by he/him whenever possible. There have been slip-ups, but I know they're trying.
In 2019 I started dating my boyfriend. It's been nearly two years (March) and he's only ever called me his girlfriend once, back at the start of our relationship when I forced myself back in my closet and identified as nonbinary.
For my family, my parents and siblings, I don't know. Some know, some kind of know, some don't. To those who know, I love you with all my heart, thank you for being there for me. To my mum, I'm not your daughter. In your eyes, I'll probably always be, and that's what upsets me the most. I'll never grow back my luscious, thick hair. I don't see why you can't understand that. To my dad, I'm unsure what your stance is on transgender people, but I hope you can support me and see me as your son.
There's a lot more I haven't written about my struggles as a transgender person, a lot that I won't go into detail about.
I've struggled with depression for years, a large portion is because of not being supported by those who I love.

For a final message: I'm not your daughter. I'm not your sister. I'm not your aunt. I'm not your sick sexual fantasy or even my own. I'm not trans because someone forced me to. I'm not mutilating my body, I'm fixing it. I can wear dresses and skirts because if a cis man, cis woman or trans woman can do it, why can't I. I can be as feminine as I want, or as masculine as I want.

I am a son. I'm a brother. I'm an uncle. I'm a guy, I'm transgender. But most importantly, I'm me.

I'm Oscar. Thank you for reading.

Just for some background, I'm 33 AMAB, 5'7"", more body hair than I'd like and less hair on my head than I'd like. I weight 168lbs and have a somewhat muscular frame (talk about a dysphoric lump of clay)

Year 1
-start growing hair/dieting
-talk with S/O about wanting to be female
-speak to doctor about being trans
-get referral to endo, make appointment
-make arrangements to do counseling while transitioning because this will be one hell of an emotional rollercoaster that no one should do alone
-get blood work done to make sure I qualify for hrt (estrogen and t blockers)
*assuming I qualify*
-go to sperm bank and freeze ma bois while I still got em (just in case)
-start HRT
-book appointment for facial laser hair removal and proceed with sessions to remove all traces of facial hair
-exercise every day cardio to lose fat and drop to target weight of 135 and also exercised to make my butt perky as my fat starts to redistribute to my hips/thighs/butt
-learn makeup and master makeup *in private*
*pray to the HRT gods every day that my hair that's fallen out regrows*
-continue to get regular blood work every few months to ensure my estrogen levels are on point
-hopefully start to notice feminization in face and rest of body
*once I can't hide it anymore*
-come out as trans to family/co-workers/friends (including my 6yr old son)
-go shopping for new wardrobe (retail therapy ftw!!)
-start to present more in public

Year 2
Hopefully at this point I will be in target hormone range
-continue HRT (preferably the needles because even though I hate them, the results are supposedly better and it's has less potential to be harmful long term)
-hopefully by this time, I will be out full time as female in public
-make appointment for SRS otherwise known as the meat yeet.. (I live in Canada so I'm fortunate enough to have it covered by free health care)
-get SRS and go through hella scary surgery/recovery (but will be so worth it)
-by the end of year 2, hope that the estrogen has feminized my face/body hair and regrown enough hair on my head that I won't need any procedures

Year 3 (final lap)
Assuming HRT has not done all I hope for it to do and the gods have failed me
-book FFS (will likely need this anyway because I have a horrible man nose)
-resume laser hair removal to get rid of remaining masculine body hair
-look into hair transplant surgeries

After all is said and done, hope that I pass and that I live the remainder of my days in euphoric bliss as a girl

Ok.. So step 1-4 are done.. Just a bit more to go on my journey. Wish me luck..

Also, from those who are transitioning, please feel free to comment about your experience and/or anything I missed. There are so many people confused about being trans or having ""those feelings"" they need to know it's nothing to be afraid of. Be happy, be you. I feel like I've done a fair bit of research and have kind of an idea of what's ahead of me, I'd like for other trans women just starting out who may be unsure or just figuring out what's involved, to have a point of reference because we're a community and we're all in this together.

2020-11-14 06:17:50,jtx6dx,3,1,"disclaimer - ftm here, been on t for almost 2 years no big hang ups, and i do subcutaneous shots in my stomach once a week. i got more needles today and realized as i was doing my shot just a bit ago that they’re too long, so i figure they’re just thin intramuscular needles. i just didn’t go as deep and went for it, but should i go back and get the right ones? does the depth im inserting the needle matter a ton? or am i good to use these ones and just sort of freeball it?

another question i have is regarding inconsistencies with my shot. im terrible at remembering anything and my shot day is no different. i go 1-2 weeks a stretch without doing it sometimes and then do it again, same dose. the only thing i ever really notice is that if i don’t do it a while i get moody and if it’s 2 weeks or more my period comes back. how terrible is this for my system health wise?  should i really be trying to do it on time consistently?

I previously made a post that trans people can be considered transformers. Well, I am not the only one who thinks this. President Vladimir Putin stated at the G20 that he believes that trans people are the human first transformers in our history. “They’ve thought up six or five genders – transformers, trans… I don’t even understand what it is myself.” (mygnews, 2019). Now I’d you look beyond the black and white statement and look deeper into the nuance of what he is saying, he is saying that they are transformers because they are biologically achieving something that humans could not achieve before. It is really incredible, and thus the trans community deserves a positive recognition to be referred to as transformers.

However, talking with this person has made me want to become more knowledgeable on the subject, much like my LGB friends caused me to change some viewpoints and become less ignorant as well several years ago. 

My main question right now is a confusion about the label/title/etc. that is used by a trans person. 

If someone says they are a trans man, does that mean that they are male to female or female to male? 

How do you know what pronouns to use towards someone? Is it rude to ask? Further, is it rude to ask about the status of their transition (just dressing differently, or operations to be different)?

Is someone who dresses and acts like the opposite birth sex that are considered trans (like a drag Queen or cross dresser), or is it only those who are actually diagnosed with gender dysphoria who are considered trans?

I don’t mean to be rude with any of these questions. I’m just trying to figure out how to be more actively supportive of my friend and their journey.

Is it rude to ask? Further, is it rude to ask about the status of their transition (just dressing differently, or operations to be different)?\n\nIs someone who dresses and acts like the opposite birth sex that are considered trans (like a drag Queen or cross dresser), or is it only those who are actually diagnosed with gender dysphoria who are considered trans?\n\nI don’t mean to be rude with any of these questions. I’m just trying to figure out how to be more actively supportive of my friend and their journey.\n\nTIA', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Meaning of different titles/transitions?', 'created': 1605399904.0}"

I just found out through my mom that my younger brother by a few years told her that he wants to move out, pretty far away, and start the transition of becoming a woman. It hit me like a wall of bricks for many reasons. Mainly, I’ve never had an inkling he might be trans, not even gay or bi. Second, he’s never fully accepted me! He hadn’t even switched over to correct pronouns on me multiple times. According to him, it’s a mental illness. But, he’s felt this way all along. 

I told mom he needs to see a therapist, and he’s going to. I’m afraid of suicide because he’s had thoughts before, has a collection of guns, and has alcoholism.

I previously made a post that trans people can be considered transformers. Well, I am not the only one who thinks this. President Vladimir Putin stated at the G20 that he believes that trans people are the human first transformers in our history. “They’ve thought up six or five genders – transformers, trans… I don’t even understand what it is myself.” (mygnews, 2019). Now I’d you look beyond the black and white statement and look deeper into the nuance of what he is saying, he is saying that they are transformers because they are biologically achieving something that humans could not achieve before. It is really incredible, and thus the trans community deserves a positive recognition to be referred to as transformers.

I previously made a post that trans people can be considered transformers. Well, I am not the only one who thinks this. President Vladimir Putin stated at the G20 that he believes that trans people are the human first transformers in our history. “They’ve thought up six or five genders – transformers, trans… I don’t even understand what it is myself.” (mygnews, 2019). Now I’d you look beyond the black and white statement and look deeper into the nuance of what he is saying, he is saying that they are transformers because they are biologically achieving something that humans could not achieve before. It is really incredible, and thus the trans community deserves a positive recognition to be referred to as transformers.

There are so many challenges we will face in this world by being trans, things that make relationships, work life, medical issues, etc all extremely difficult.  But I want to focus on getting education. Also I’m sorry if anyone’s written similar posts already.
      I’ve dealt with a lot of judgement and loss of support from my family since coming out, they have gaslit me, prevented me from getting medical transition treatments, and my mom said if I got any feminine clothes then she wouldn’t help pay for my classes.  My dad wouldn’t let me live at home if I started hormone therapy. I have now been left out on my own to find work, a place to stay, and afford school to work towards a career.  Even though things are very hard right now, if I didn’t start transitioning and lose their support, I’d be so much more depressed for being who they’d rather me be, not be able to get medical care, and I maybe wouldn’t even here right now.  
     Around 1 in 10 trans people have been kicked out by their family for who they are, and 1 in 5 have been discriminated against in school or work.  It’s such a sad reality to comprehend..  so many people in this world can be so cruel. 
     I’ve also felt very judged and looked down upon in some classes, and some teachers don’t seem to respect my gender identity at all even after explaining.  Since I don’t pass all the time sometimes I almost feel like a target, especially with any sort of gendered-things (bathrooms, sports, etc)
It’s just all a saddening thing to go through these things, even gender dysphoria alone is incredibly difficult to cope with, and to add to all the challenges within and outside of college, it is just insane how expensive colleges can be.
      I posted a link which is a scholarship opportunity for trans students, which really is amazing!  Of course there is a lot of work to be done to help students get into and feel supported inside school, but I think this is a really good step to help any of us who are struggling and don’t have the support many people do have. 
     Anyways thanks for reading! Hope you’re all doing okay.

I'm very aware of its flaws: my pitch and resonance are pretty much OK, but it's a bit scratchy (I'm working on false fold control at the moment, and my intonation isn't quite there either. I've had on-and-off training with a voice therapist this year, some in person and some on Zoom, but he's not been available lately.

I was watching a couple of videos on it last night, looking for resources for someone else, and found a good one on resonance. My wife was next to me and started asking questions about it.  She asked if I would go back to my old voice and change that, and was very offensive about my current voice.

As I said before, my current voice is by no means perfect and I still want to work on it, but it's now my default voice, it's the one I think in if I verbalise stuff in my mind, and despite its flaws I'm still a lot happier with this voice than my old one, which I always hated, and I can't really remember how to speak in. I'm reluctant to even try, because, well, dysphoria.

This isn't the first conversation we've had like this - she's said stuff after my voice therapy, even during it at one point - I had to end that session early as I was so embarrased.. Last night it escalated pretty fast. She made a pretty cruel comparison of my voice to a caricature. She complained about me being offended by what she was saying, and I said that I was offended because she was being offensive. That has resulted in sleep on the sofa for me, and a 'Don't talk to me' this morning.

She asked if I would go back to my old voice and change that, and was very offensive about my current voice.\n\nAs I said before, my current voice is by no means perfect and I still want to work on it, but it's now my default voice, it's the one I think in if I verbalise stuff in my mind, and despite its flaws I'm still a lot happier with this voice than my old one, which I always hated, and I can't really remember how to speak in. I'm reluctant to even try, because, well, dysphoria.\n\nThis isn't the first conversation we've had like this - she's said stuff after my voice therapy, even during it at one point - I had to end that session early as I was so embarrased.. Last night it escalated pretty fast. She made a pretty cruel comparison of my voice to a caricature. She complained about me being offended by what she was saying, and I said that I was offended because she was being offensive. That has resulted in sleep on the sofa for me, and a 'Don't talk to me' this morning. I'm a whole bag of emotions about it now, I feel like just speaking pisses her off, and I've no idea how to proceed."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My wife hates my voice', 'created': 1605456369.0}"

How this was actually something that stopped myself from moving forward. Moving on. A year and a half ago I had my Heart crushed. Oh what A Time that was. Its very interesting when things are moving forward, thinking that for the first time in my life I was with someone that I was meant to be with for longevity, the only thing I didn't know though, was that God and the Universe had another plans. 

  
I look at this situation as a karma. Karma for something I had done to someone when I was younger, immature, unaware, again though, all for the process. Fast forward a decade, now I was going through all the same things that I had caused to someone who was very special to me at the time. Its all growth. Wow. It through me off my journey I was living that I was falsifying to myself as well as everyone else I met.

  
In the first 6 to 8 months after this person and I parted ways, I was stuck. Stuck in a whole of alcohol and marijuana abuse, daily. Where it had went from a celebration mood to a necessity and a habit **everyday.** It kept me focus though, on my passion, my craft, my goals that I was continuously setting everyday for now and for the time ahead. It was difficult though. I was numb. It was the least expected thing I had ever thought was going to happen. Their I was, sitting in the midst of the ocean, sinking lower and lower everyday with my body so high up in the clouds that there was no space in between. Looking Down, Looking Up. 

  
I was Stuck. I kept on reminiscing to why things had changed so quickly? Was it me? What did I Say? What should have I done better? This was the first time in my life that I had actually felt that **love** was very clear with my Being, Mind &amp; Body and I had no way out. I stayed focused though on the sole thing that I knew was mine, **my** **passion of art.** 

  
What kept me stuck though was the dwelling, thinking of them and continuously saying to myself ""I miss them"" ""I miss what we had"" ""I miss seeing them"", but not being able to share that with them. At the time I felt betrayed. I felt let down &amp; What i came to realize is that I let myself down by opening myself up so much that I had let someone else's own divine path change my whole state of Being as A Human. Learning. Realignment. For Life.

  
I Am Grateful for What Happened and Now Who I Am. Without it all, I wouldn't be here today as the Proud Trans Woman, I am. 

  
Feel all the feels, Its valid. Sit in them. Do what feels natural to you. The thing that really kept me motivated was not judging myself for my excessive drinking or marijuana use. It made me feel good. It made me feel happy. I went with it. During those waves, being tossed upside down, upside right, on my head, standing flat footed, I never thought that ""Time would Heal"" My State of Being. Now, Here, I Am. Time Does Heal. Do what makes you feel your highest self through battles and struggles from the unknown. You will get to a place of your life that you have never known through extreme trials and tribulations, hardships, pain, sadness. 

  
Its all Valid and so are You.  


I love you.

Like imagine being so sad that you feel the need to do to others that you do to yourself. I need to know if I’m in the wrong here though.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Outsider here.

I have begun to learn that expectations that I create for myself and from others usually end up with feeling anxious, vulnerable, stressed and in a state of being and mind that isn't who I am meant to be. Its needed though for the time being.

Its allowing me to learn that as long as I am feeling good about whatever I am pursuing then thats all that matters. If I do something without receiving it back from someone else and feel stressed from that, than what I was doing initially was with a subconscious expectation in the future which is not a genuine action. I am Human. I am Learning. I am Healing.

The Best that can be done each day is simply that. These times we have been inside has been realigning, filled with many ups, many downs and everything in between. I am grateful.  
I learned the other day that God, Higher Power, The Universe wants us to Shine but doesn't care about the struggle we have to go through to get there, which to me........is so powerful and eye opening. The Shine and the Blooming has to have to many, many moments of struggles because it is preparing me for whats to come by living in the present, in the Now. Embrace. It. All. Its all Divine. Its all Valid. Its all Meant to Be. For Myself and for You. For Us.

Continue to do your best today. Continue to Hold Faith. Continue to Trust. God and the Universe isn't finished with us sister. Everyones time comes, usually which exceeds our own expectations that we set out to accomplish.

Everything is ok. Everything is happening for the Best.

I love you.

AMAB (27F)


My whole entire life from a kid until now..

When someone called me handsome, it just didn’t feel right. I always thought I just wasn’t good looking, and I perceived that feeling of sadness as ‘I’m ugly.’ But now I see why I got sad.. it isn’t because I’m not ‘handsome.’
It’s because I’m pretty. 

When my chest started growing (32A now) at 12/13 and I felt uncomfortable taking my shirt off in front of people, especially other boys my age, and I didn’t know why. I thought I felt insecure and fat. It wasn’t because I was fat or insecure about my body.
It was because a girl shouldn’t be taking her shirt off to just anyone (my opinion.) 

When my dad always called me ‘son,’ I used to get sad. I thought he was saying it in a harsh way. Not I see he wasn’t. 
I’m just not a son. I’m a daughter.

When my dad used to tell me to put muscle into whatever it was I was doing, I would be sad. I never knew why it made me sad. Now I know why. 
As a girl, it just feels weird to have someone say that to you. It does to me, anyway. 

When my whole life I’ve screamed to people ‘something is wrong!’ Nothing was wrong. 
I just wasn’t living the way my body felt like it was supposed to be living. My soul, body heart and mind were all living in disconnect. Each trying to govern its own way of living just to survive. 

When I grew up sitting down to pee (still do) and never knew why. Now I know why.
It was just instinct. Sure, I may have something different down there then most girls, but that just makes me unique 🥰

Now it all makes sense. 

Maybe these posts are getting on people nerves. Maybe they’re not. But this is so life changing and special to me. How can you not share the excitement of finally becoming alive after feeling dead for 27 years? I’ve never seen the light I see emerging from my eyes the way I have the past few days.

I will continue to post my journey no matter what. I will continue to feel pain. I will continue to cry alone, purging all the toxicity I swallowed growing up. I will continue to figure myself out because I’m strong and I’m a warrior. Yes, I am a warrior. And I will continue to lift my fellow humans up, male or female, because we should all strive to lift up others. 
And I’m going to fall so in love with myself and I want to look back one day and say ‘wow, look at how far she (me) came.’ I want to say ‘I did it.’ Because when my time comes, I want to be able to look back and say I lived my life in the way I wanted to because it made me happy and that’s all that matters. I want to inspire all genders and all races to be who they want to be and not live a lie. 
Suppression is so much more painful than the fear of being who you truly are. I want to show people it’s okay to be afraid, but also that fighting against that fear leads to a life you could never even have imagined. 

I guess that’s all for now. 🙂 
Going shopping tomorrow for my very first female wardrobe and makeup... wish me luck 💜

A New Day. Did You get Enough Sleep? Yes? No? Wake Up Sis. Its time to Go HARDER Today. We Can Sleep Tonight. We Will NOT Sleep on This Opportunity. WAKE UP.

Being there for myself has been a constant struggle and battle my whole life. Putting other peoples needs before mine has been something that I have always been so quick to do. Awakening. Why do we do this? I am Healing. From my insecurities, my trauma, my identity, my Being. The only thing I can do today is My Best &amp; so, I will do Just That. I hope you do too.

With the change from fall to winter, less sun, more grey, its time to go into a hermit turtle mode with the inner guidance of a Lion. Its time to really wake up and go on offence against the darkness, the evils that are TRYING &amp; let me tell you, REALLY TRYING to Consume My Being, Mind, Body &amp; Spirit. We are Stronger. Its Greater than Right Here, Right Now, Living though, through this present moment.

Healing Takes Time. Practice day to day will lead to minor growth that by the end of the day, week, month, year Is a SnowBall Uphill.

Look back at where you were a year ago? Progress? Growth? Still in the same place? This is your moment and sign to Change if you are unhappy with being stuck. It starts with trying something differently. Focusing on daily routines and habits but realizing that those have been set in stone by myself and no one else, I can change them if I want. Its about the systems that influence the change I want to make, rather than the change in itself.

I am Healing, I am Broken, I am Growing, I am Strong. I know you are Too. Start Today.  
Do something Differently, it will start the journey that is intended, slowly but with correct pace.

I love you.

2020-11-17 21:14:30,jw1npb,8,1,"Yo yo, young trans-masc NB here, so recently I’ve been thinking of the future and when I’m supposed to start on testosterone and I’ve been reading a lot about it and tried to “prepare” myself for the future. 

The recommended age to start on testosterone that I’ve found is about 16 years old and it’s the same year as I start college and move in with my friends into a dorm. 

I also read that I probably have to go on a doctor’s visit to get the testosterone prescription out and I can choose to not notify my parents that I’ve been there. But the problem is that my mother is against this and I yet haven’t come out to my dad and that means I will most likely do this on my own and with the help of my friends.

My concern is if there is an age limit for buying/getting out the testosterone? I’ve thought of this for almost 2 months and I’m 99% sure I want to do this and I’ve chosen I’ll do it by gel.

this journey has also opened the door to so many new feelings and emotions. i feel like my emotions are on hyperdrive, which i love and am grateful for but god damn it’s dark at the bottom.

2020-11-18 09:26:17,jwcrpi,5,6,"Sorry this post is going to be a damn-near life story, I guess I'm just in need of some kind of catharsis...

I am genuinely terrified to make this post as I am just re drudging up an immense chunk of my life that I thought was buried, however, I need voices coming back to me from real lovely people, not just my fearful conscience. 

I'm 23, male, and was raised in a very religious household; strict to the point of having many decisions made for me by some old white dudes - as many cults and religions are ran (you can feel the vitriol I'm sure). Around the end of high school, and having some unfun sexual encounters with some female folk, I started to realize I was just wrong and off, and feelings of wishing to be a girl started flooding my brain. I would buy wigs, clothes, and tried make up, all of which felt amazing! It was like a part of myself had been finally brought to the surface to breathe, but I couldn't let it out for real. After several months of trying to figure out what to do, I came out as Trans to my parents, and was immediately met with severe contempt, shame, and scorn, even being told that ""Satan has a hold of you and is winning!"" CLASSIC. Needless to say, after copious therapy from out-of-touch old men, who were, incidentally, part of the same faith, I decided to follow the best course of action. Repression. NICE.

Fast forward a few years and I'm dating a woman who would go on to become my wife. The repression worked, needless to say. I had a few bouts of some kind of dysphoria, but was able to shake it off. After being married for only about 7 months, around Christmas, (ironically the same time of year I started having dysphoria originally) I started having severe dysphoria. I would describe it as a constant almost physical feeling, almost like being high, that just sat in my brain never to leave, constantly beckoning. I would look in the mirror and see the wrong person, I would try make up only to throw it away before anyone knew I had it. I started acting like I used to in high school, feminine, a behavior trend that was obvious and natural to me, that I suppressed under the enforced requirements of religious conformity - can't have boys behaving like girls, now can we. Finally I told my wife. We figured I should explore my suppressed femme side with clothing, make up and the like (she is VERY open minded and so sweet). The dysphoria spiraled to the point where we were just about ready to divorce, but I was able to back away, and put myself back in a ""normal"" state, where the dysphoria went away. Repressed again, I suppose, unintentionally this time. Divorce averted. 

I thought that was that at this point, and for about 7 months that's how its been, placid, serene, no gender issues here, sir. But alas, no less than 2 weeks ago it started again... My brain is alight with thoughts from clothing to surgery, make up to changing my name, wanting to begin a new life as a person I have always had in my mind, but always condemned to suppression.

I am now at a crossroads of so many issues I have NO IDEA what to do. I promised myself, and more importantly, my wife, that this ended months ago, and that it was gone forever, yet here it is. I'm frightened to even bring it up to her, even the possibility of therapy, for fear of a new massive rift forming, like it did months ago. I know that if I chose to transition it would mean divorce, and perhaps that's what needs to happen for me to explore my authentic self. I love her WAY too much to have her be caught up in watching her husband essentially becoming her wife. 

Or do I repress, healthily, with therapy, and fight back the feelings I have to transition. I unfortunately have the type of mindset that I can exist with constant internal conflict and still continue on in life, no matter how unhealthy. That option sucked to write.

My goal now is to try and find a way to get to therapy, and just talk and talk and talk, which, from this post alone, you can tell I enjoy doing just that. Lol. But I just need advice, feedback, someone to yell at me, something!

That option sucked to write.\n\nMy goal now is to try and find a way to get to therapy, and just talk and talk and talk, which, from this post alone, you can tell I enjoy doing just that. Lol. But I just need advice, feedback, someone to yell at me, something! \n\nUgh...\n\nAs you can tell from the 3rd to last paragraph, especially the possibility of divorce part, I tend to be brutally objective, so please let your thoughts and comments fly, haha.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Married, Dysphoric, and Scared.', 'created': 1605716777.0}"

Basically, it's been a long time coming. I've suspected it was possible for awhile. It's not a huge shock or anything. I am bisexual and nonbinary and extremely supportive, this is not an obstacle to our relationship at all. I am SO happy for him that he has been able to get to the point where he's finally understanding himself and accepting this and I want to help on this journey the best way I can.... I don't think he plans to transition yet, although I've made it clear I will be supportive the entire way whenever he's ready, if he's ever ready, from pronouns to name change to body change I don't care I'm going to be the #1 cheerleader!!! 

1. I guess I am just looking for any and all advice from those more experienced than me. Is there anything I can do to make him feel more comfortable and safe in exploring different pronoun usage, etc? 

2. He has already been exploring more feminine clothes for awhile but has been struggling a lot on where to shop, so it would mean the world to me if anyone has suggestions for mtf online clothes stores!! 

3. Is there anything else I can do besides just continue to show my unwavering support? I don't want to be overwhelming about it...

I told him I wanna have a ""girls day"" next week (I'm not very ""girly"" but I'll do my best lol).

[https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/](https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/)[https://twitter.com/transscloset](https://twitter.com/transscloset)The goal is to provide one full day outfit (tops, bottoms, and socks) and one set of pajamas to trans people (more specifically minors, but adults are more than welcomed too!) who otherwise cannot afford to begin a new wardrobe or wouldn't be able to have access to such items because of their family situation. Each package works on a $100ish budget, so any additional requests that are made after what's already promised will be squeezed into there as much as possible.

Binders ARE an option, and will be guaranteed to be in the packages if requested, even if it goes a bit over budget. Same for bras. The only clothes I'm currently not willing to include is underwear, as I don't exactly feel comfortable picking that out for strangers, let alone minors. BUT everything else is fair game (you can even request shoes, makeup, or anything you can think of!).

I've already planned ahead for safety concerns, so please don't be afraid to request one if your situation's a more closeted one. You can request your items to be shipped within a backpack or other nondescript item for concealment, and chose how much pride items can be included, what the name is on the shipping label, etc. I want this to be accessible to as many people as possible!

I am accepting donations, but I've designed this to be able to be done out of my own pocket, so please don't feel pressured to do so. For now, I'm taking in request forms for the next month or so, and will begin fulfilling them at the start of January 2021 at the very latest. Please share this with anyone who you think could benefit!  


EDIT: Since so many people have been offering clothes, I want to clarify that for the most part, I'm not taking a ton of donated clothes. I don't have a lot of space for it where I live currently and the main idea is that the clothes people get still feel very ""new"", or at least not super well lived in.

This is something that is a daily struggle, daily strength. I am learning to make peace with the things that I can not change in this very moment, that will change with time; my facial hair, my body parts, wearing what I want, accepting myself for me and embracing the empowerment that comes with that. Its difficult but I know that this is my purpose, this is meant for me and honestly I'd rather it no other way.

  
Being grateful for the ones who understand from the get go and learning to have compassion and empathy for the ones that it might take a lot more work and a lot more time with, my parents, distant family etc. Some days it feels like too much, some days im exhausted from the minute I have risen. 1:11. Make a wish. I know this all apart of my purpose and journey. Its greater than right now by living in the present. 

  
Remember, its ok to feel tired, its ok to admit that I don't feel good today because their is always a higher reason for all of this. Sun shining, break through the clouds. Something I realized the other day is that in the midst of the worst storm possible, the blue sky hasn't ran away, its lingering behind the clouds, the Sun is still there, it hasn't gone anywhere. Its about Perspective and Self Awareness, to feel all the feels and sit in them but as well as, to know that this will only last for a short period of time. With the back end of Growth, Self Love, Self Fulfillment, Abundance and Miracles. God, Thank you For it All.

  
I love you.

Its all possible. It starts with dedication.

When I began my creative journey 3 years ago it was difficult to start out. I didn't have any routines, I didn't know where to start and how. I was so used to a ""9-5"" framework, with my hours being chosen for me, who I reported to, what tasks I had to complete during that shift, when my breaks were and when it was time to go home.

I knew though, deep down, that life is more than this. Life is about creating my own schedule, my own daily tasks, my own timeline, holding myself accountable for the ""mistakes"" and how I can improve myself for next time. Being accountable for my day to day of course as well as took time. 1 thing that really allowed me to have Peace is knowing, that if I did 1 single thing towards my craft and goals everyday, than thats progress. That I was moving forward and that was the only important thing about a new journey with a lack of knowledge of being self sufficient.

Don't get me wrong though, those jobs are needed. They are needed because if you are starting a new journey, you have to know that you can't expect or rely on anyone else to move your forward or support you. You must support yourself, pay your own bills and continue to work hard everyday towards what you know is your ""Dream"". I didn't have it all figured out at the start and I still don't, 3 years later. I know though, that with hard work everyday, that I am progressing and I am continuing to move Forward. Set goals daily. Set Goals for where you want to be next week, next month, 6 months from now, then; Work Hard. Every possible minute you get. The Universe will Guide you. Do Your Best Today to make it easier for yourself, tomorrow.

I love you.

This article approaches the world we live in from a holistic systems thinking perspective. It is also applicable in the transgender community, as it allows us to see the complexity of the world. Because many different 'systems' can influence each other on different levels, and each and every one of us has (slightly) different systems that are influencing us, one can understand that the phenomena that these systems produce/influence, are very complex and variable. Nothing really is black or white in nature. Everything rather is a product of complex systems interacting with each other, and is variable. Everything is realitve. The world around us is chaotic. Many things, because of the variability created by the complexity and slight differences in each interacting system, need to be seen as a continuum rather then a black/white or right/wrong story. This way, we can look at gender the same way: as a continuum. Most of us are on the extreme ends of the spectrum (male or female) but that doesn't mean there aren't non-binary people. Same goes for biological sex. most of us have either male or female genitalia but that doesn't mean therr aren't any intersex people. Gender and sex are influenced by millions and millions of systems, from biochemistry, physics, mathematics, genetics, embryology, neurology and psychology, all the way to social structures, culture and even economics. We might not be able to identify each and every one of the factors influencing gender and sex, but at least we can acknowledge that is a very complex trait that needs to be studied more and from a more generalized, systems thinking point of view. The world around us is much more complex then we like to think. People that say trans women aren't women, or trans men aren't men, have a very simplistic and unscientific view about gender and sex. We might actually need to rethink our conservative view on sex and gender. We might even need to rethink all of our 'old' definitions.

When it comes to someone's pronouns, what is the correct way to approach the conversation? Is it best to assume pronouns or is asking better?

 I was assigned make at birth, and I didn’t necessarily have a problem with it since the concept of one being trans wasn’t introduced to me until my mid teens. After that revelation was when I decided to do a bit of inward looking to find myself. I thought maybe I was two-spirited for a while, even going so far as to attend my junior homecoming in a dress (the wig I had was hideous but that’s beside the point). Reactions that night varied from neutral, to being called attractive, to some dude going “Whoa, what the hell?” as I passed him. That last one made me realize something that still gets under my skin four years later: some very visible parts of my body - mostly my facial region - are so blatantly, irreparably male that I can’t see the feminine person in me.

I’m sure I’ve always had body dysphoria to a certain degree, as the media will do to most kids; however, my realization of my appearance was the first time gender dysphoria actually dealt a blow to me. Since then, I’ve been stuck teetering on the binary scale between accepting that I may never look the way I want and going full-on girl to counteract it. I’ve recognized my entire life that I wasn’t your run-of-the-mill football and beef jerky type of guy, but I realistically can’t see others viewing me as a girl either.

“OP,” you’re probably thinking to yourself, “that could very well mean you’re non-binary.

And you may be right. My most recent self-exploration brings up enough evidence that this may be true; only, it somehow still doesn’t feel right. If I wanted to get really specific, agender may be the most accurate word out there to describe me, but even that somehow doesn’t quite hit the mark. I think of my situation like a dart about to hit a board: the board itself is the binary scale and the wall behind it is the non-binary space. My dart looked like it was about to hit the wall, but it somehow stuck itself up on the ceiling instead.

I was hoping some more experienced people in this community may be able to help me put my confusion aside, cause it’s low-key driving me crazy. Feel free to ask for any vital information I may have left out, I didn’t feel like typing an essay today.

I'm posting on here so I can get some extra info and insight into the non binary/trans world. I'm not used to much of terminology (cis female here) so I apologise if I cause any offence, I just want to learn more to benefit and support my sibling.

My brother is 14 and we have a really close relationship. He recently came out as gay (bisexual to our dad) and he's always been quite feminine with his interests. He loved playing with dolls (still does in the way of doing their hair and designing their clothes, but he will only play with ones that are the same race as him - mixed raced or black dolls - because he says he relates to them more), loves hair and makeup and has a group of friends that are exclusively girls. Our dad (he's a single dad, their mum isn't in the picture at all) buys his clothing and dresses the boys quite masculine. However, as my brother has hit puberty, he's become interested in shaving off his facial hair and waxing his legs. He has worn fake nails before and liked the look. He wants to buy a long haired wig and wear natural looking make up so he can 'pass' as female. He even said ""if I was trans I don't know what my female name would be"". He's also been talking a lot about the other trans-girl in his class and how she doesn't feel accepted by her parents and isn't exclusively out to her parents. He also asked what bathroom he would use if he was.

I know this doesn't mean he is trans, he may be trans he may not. But i guess I was looking for more information on

I don't have dysphoria/dysmorphia but I am trying to learn about them. There is so much more to it than just ""I hate my body"" so I'm doing research. Anybody know of simple, easy to understand places to learn? Or a short paragraph explaining it?

\- Where is the point where general body anxiety turns into genuine dysphoria/dysmorphia? Is it where it severely impacts your living? Are there stages to gender dysphoria? Or is there only one real gender  dysphoria?

Uh, I'm a guy I guess.

I don't feel like I'm in the wrong body for the most part, but I still feel very uncomfortable about my body hair and some features for example. I get massive anxiety from the hair growing out of my face. I can't concentrate and it makes me feel filthy. I'm very self conscious about my body hair and if I can hide it with long clothes (even in the summer) I will. The only hair I want on my body is my long hair. (They are secondary male characteristics, lol) I really wish I was more androgynous.

(I have episodes where i wish i had a female body, or at least wouldn't mind one, but that's just occasional so dunno if that counts)

2020-11-19 21:50:25,jxc495,3,4,"I took a cross country trip last night and decided to dress for the drive, which I've done many, many times without incident. I'm pre-everything (still closeted) so I still have to do basic stuff in boy mode, like get gas and use the men's room (ugh). So anyway, I'm cruising through Utah at about 1am or so and a cop turns his lights on to pull me over. I had no idea what I had done wrong. I had the cruise set to proper limit, wasn't swerving, and couldn't figure out what i had done wrong. I was terrified, mortified, nervous, and just wanted to die right there. You see, I was wearing a cute dress, padded bra, nylons, and knee high boots. My MPB and several days of beard growth definitely did not go with the rest of my attire. 

After I parked, and waiting for the officer to come to my window, I figured f$@k it, there's nothing I can do but deal with it. He knocks on the passenger window which I roll down. He tells me that he pulled me over for failure to signal for 2 seconds before changing lanes. He asks for my ID and already knew my car was a rental and asked for the contract. He didn't notice my outfit until he shined his flashlight towards me while it was getting the contract. I couldn't see his face because he was wearing a mask. He asked me a couple questions about my trip and the rental and then told me to signal for a bit longer before changing lanes. He never laughed, stared, or made me feel uncomfortable in any way.

It could not have gone any smoother. I kept my cool and he was very professional about the whole thing. I'm pretty sure I  have a few extra gray hairs but all in all was surprisingly easy. I'm sure that wouldn't always be the case but I felt very relieved when it was over.

So, i pull into the parking lot, get out, prep my VA ID (which uses a 20+ year old photo...lol) and a nurse greets me out side to do the covid screen questions, after i say no to all she comments,

Right around then he pulled out the vials and checked them, and i guess their codes made something click. He looked at them, then at me, i mentioned that I knew of 2 but not the third,  he goes looking for what it is, i think he finds it, because he looks at me again, mumbles something under his breath about the test that i didn't catch and stopped the small talk he had been doing up until then.

After a tense minute of no talking and my body not taking the stick, i bring up that today is an injection day and he asks if its insulin, and I respond with hormones, he got really quiet, rushed through extraction of the butterfly and bandaging. And was real short with a good bye.  I'm to bemused to take offense and go along my way.

Some days my Body Feels Rested from 6 hours of sleep where I will Wake up at 7:30am, Some days my Body Feels Rested from 8 hours of sleep where I will Wake up at 9:15am and Some days My Body Needs 10 Hours of sleep and i'll wake up close to 11:00am.

This used to make me feel shitty to be honest, that I have wasted part of my day that I could have been spending time towards my craft, or simply going through my morning routines. I have come to realize that Yes, Opportunities are great to captivate on and we can catch up on Sleep, but Sleep is the only way we will be able to continue chugging along on the highway. 

I have come to learn to follow how my body feels and allow myself to sleep more if needed, start slower if needed &amp; go at my own pace. I have realized that in the past and still sometimes now, when I am beating myself up, dwelling, feeling down or trying to rush through something, then thats me subconsciously comparing myself to someone else that I have seen on Social Media or this day to day set of requirements I have for myself, that happens subconsciously without even realizing it.

I have come to learn and make peace with going at my own speed and releasing the need of comparing myself to others, that I am not going fast enough or that I haven't gotten an opportunity that I want. It took for me to go through anxiety attacks &amp; mental breakdowns to realize that instead of enjoying the moment and the process, I was creating more tension and battles with myself. It all takes time and I know that it was all meant to be.

Give yourself the time needed. Give yourself the space needed. Give yourself the rest needed. Give yourself the fresh air needed. Enjoy the process and journey, rather than being obsessed with the destination. God/Higher Power/The Universe always has more in store than we think, that happens organically and effortlessly through dedicated hard work.

I love you.

I live in Maryland, and I am aware of a publicly-funded agency that wants to refuse to call people by their preferred pronouns.

Before I completely go off at them, I’m wondering if there is some sort of database related to trans rights?

I have done some digging, and Maryland law states that people cannot be discriminated against in public settings due to gender identity, which includes hotels and restaurants, but not churches. 

It is also illegal to discriminate against trans individuals in employment or housing. 

The Maryland department of education requires that students be referred to by their preferred pronouns. 

The department of health states that best practices include referring to someone by their preferred pronoun. 

None of these is as specific as I wish it was, but I think these guidelines certainly set the tone for Maryland’s legal attitude toward gender identity. 

I am hoping to persuade them from a pragmatic angle that they need to respect people’s gender identity (as much as I would like to give them a piece of my mind!).

I am also not opposed to making ethics complaints or contacting the ACLU or similar entities regarding this matter.

I hope it's ok for me to post this here. If it isn't please let me know, happy to take it down.

I am an Australian novelist and budding webtoon artist. Of late I have had a burning desire to write a medieval fantasy novel (and to hopefully one day turn it into a webtoon) that has a transgender male lead. Being part of the LGBTQI community myself I really wanted to create something that myself and other members of the community can identify with. I know it can be quite hard to find accurate representation; if any representation, in the fantasy genre. So I want to give it a shot and hopefully, create something worthwhile in the end.

I am hoping to hear what the transgender members of the community want to see in a transgender character. I know to not make that fact their main or sole defining characteristic, I am looking for the more subtle details and nuances that I myself am not familiar with. I do have transgender friends, and I have asked them for their input previously but they do not like to talk about their transition and such as they went through very traumatic abuse at the time and it is a painful subject to discuss. Out of love for them and not wanting to open painful wounds I want to hear from those who are comfortable talking about the subject and would be willing to share their thoughts with me.

Please let me know if this is in any way insensitive. As I said, I don't have the greatest pool of knowledge to draw from in regards to all this. It isn't my intention to offend or seem insensitive, I just genuinely want greater insight into the topic as a whole so I can do this character justice.

2020-11-21 14:28:29,jyblq5,10,1,"Hey everyone, I basically just have a lot of questions about MTF stuff. 

Here's some background info on me. I'm 23, white, male, from UK. I wouldnt say I hate my body, but I wouldn't say I like it either. Despite that, I have been thinking about whether I'd be happier living as a woman more and more. When i was a teen I'd sometimes think ""I bet I'd be happier if i were born as a girl"" but in the last couple years I've thought about this kind of thing increasingly. I go through phases where I don't think about it very much, and sometimes i think about it many many times every day. I often look at women and think ""I wish i looked like that, or could act like that"". I have a girlfriend whom I love deeply and I worry about the impact this would have, especially as she wants kids and I think I do too some day. I have depression and anxiety. It seems increasingly unlikely that this is all some sort of passing fancy or obsession, but I am very fearful of what this could all mean for my relationships and the way I would suddenly have to expect discrimination from society. I feel like I have to make a decision about whether this is something I should pursue or whether I should just try and stop thinking about it and make my peace with the kind of body and social role I have. I sometimes shave my body and it makes me feel better, and I like to think about what I'd look like as a woman. I have trans friends and consume a fair amount of trans media. This isn't my first time reading forums and stuff about this topic. I really feel like I can't progress with my life until i figure this out, and I am not doing well. 

1. Do you have to be actively dysphoric about your body to be trans?

2. What does this all mean for having children?

3. To what extent are surgeries and treatments covered by the UK's National Health Service?

4. How do you know if youre trans? What does that realisation look like? I'm scared of making the wrong choices and I don't know the answers

5. Does it get harder to transition the older you get?

6. Kind of embarrasing but whats it like having a female body as opposed to a masculine one?

7. Did anyone find their way of thinking and percieving themselves changed? I have been depressed for like 8 years for no particular reason. I'm very self critical and feel increasingly detached from society and any ambitions or dreams i once had

Any answers or any help of any kind would be appreciated.

Second, shaving, I bought some shaving cream for my legs cause I can't bear it lol, but it's kind of hard to spend all that time in the shower while my family is in the house, does anyone know how to do it without getting in the shower?

2020-11-21 23:51:31,jylcrw,0,1,"Sorry about the storytime post

This semester at college, I finally got the courage to start exploring these feelings I've had all my life. I went over to a friend's house and she let me try on one of her dresses and put on makeup. 

I was honestly really scared of doing this. I was scared that I wouldn't ""look right"" and for some reason that was a really devastating thought to me. My friend was saying that I didn't have to do it if I wasn't comfortable, but something made me feel like I kind of needed to do it for my own sake. Nothing else has ever really compelled me as much.

I was pleasantly surprised with the results. I had a lot of fun with it and I felt pretty happy doing it. Right afterward, I bought a dress of my own and I want to get a make-up set of my own. I keep looking back at the pictures I took then and feeling happy.

A week later, I decided to try hanging out with the rest of my friends in a dress. I was met with a ton of support. 

I'm still figuring a lot of this out. I was raised in a very Catholic household, so I encountered a lot of anti-trans rhetoric. It took me a while to really come to terms with what I'm feeling. Even now, I'm not really sure if I'm trans or not. 

I have a desire to be female. It's not just a desire to look feminine. At the same time, it's never really that strong or consistent. I don't know if to categorize what I feel right now as dysphoria. I'm completely fine with the body I have now. Having ""he/him"" as my pronouns doesn't feel wrong. I still feel like what I'm feeling is just self-hatred.

Sorry I went on a long tangent. 

I'm going back home for thanksgiving soon, so right now I'm wearing my dress for the last time before I drop it off at a friend's house. He'll keep it until I come back next semester.

Another interesting factor of the factor V is that hormones aren't an option (to the point that my mom and sister who also have the mutation can't take birth control). If I were to take hormones id be risking strokes, clots in the brain, loss of motor function, loss of speech, and even death.
It was devastating to say the least. Lots of long nights up crying and just feeling like there was no way out getting more and more depressed and just... I don't even know, I'm pretty sure I blocked parts of it out.

About six years ago I came out as trans after feeling that way practically all my life but not having words for it. Then I was reminded of a special genetic  blood mutation I have by the name of factor V leiden. In a nutshell this means my blood clots really quickly to close up wounds and other things.

Another interesting factor of the factor V is that hormones aren't an option (to the point that my mom and sister who also have the mutation can't take birth control). If I were to take hormones id be risking strokes, clots in the brain, loss of motor function, loss of speech, and even death.

It was devastating to say the least. Lots of long nights up crying and just feeling like there was no way out getting more and more depressed and just... I don't even know, I'm pretty sure I blocked parts of it out. 

I took up cross dressing to try and cope a bit witch ended up making me feel worse as things never fit quite right. I cut my thigh a few times when I was in a really dark place (its all healed and I never did it again although my assigned at birth is forever etched on my thigh which I'm ashamed to have, even forwent losing my virginity to a guy I really liked so he wouldn't see)

 I hit a breaking point about four years ago where i tried distancing myself from this in my appearance and speech patterns to seem more like my birth gender. My family and friends all assumed the trans ""bit"" was a phase and completely ignore that it happened. 

I'm at a point where I don't really like who I am anymore. I've had this beautiful facade of a person in the back of mind for years and the more I imagine the person I want to be the more I feel like I'm playing a role-playing game like skyrim or some shit except its a mundane life of compromise.

2020-11-22 13:33:20,jyvp7u,8,1,"Hi all! Sorry for the confusing title. I'm not quite sure how to shorten my advice request.

I am a mom to a 15 trans boy (ftm) and he has been transitioning for 2 years. Dad and I accepted him immediately, and have been creating a safe home and school environment for him in his transition. Our young man, Alex has a school buddy who is also trans ftm but has not come publicly and his mother is not happy about it. They often have sleep overs together and we always refer to them as he/him, show him ultimate respect and call him by his chosen name. However, when ever I speak to his mum (texts mainly) I avoid using names or pronouns as it seems a sensitive issue. My son tells me she is deliberately transphobic to her son, but it doesn't seem to reflect on her attitude toward Alex, as she is always respectful toward him. 


A few weeks ago, Alex bought his friend a binder. Alex has been binding for a year and it had helped massively with his dysphoria. He was hoping it would help his friend dysphoria too. However, the friend had hidden it from his disapproving mother. Well, today it was discovered and now I'm getting the sharp.end of her tongue. She has messaged me to tell me that she has punished her 'daughter' and that I'm to tell my son not to buy 'her' binders and encourage lying to her.


I totally agree with the deceit. I fucked up a bit there. I knew that they were hiding from her, but told myself it was not my place to interfere. However, the tranphobia is not acceptable, and it's a sticking block with me. I don't agree with how she treats her kid and I don't know how to respond to her message, or how to protect my son's friendship with his buddy.

I would be very grateful if anyone could offer some advice on how to proceed with this situation.

2020-11-22 14:58:30,jywxax,0,1,"Heartbreak. Realignment. Feeling all the feels. Numbing. Subconscious. Focused Passion.

  
In the past year and a half my life has been the most unexpected events possible &amp; I am grateful for it all.

     
It started 2 springs ago where I met someone through social media that made me stop and think like, wait........who are you? Where did you come from? Your energy is so pure. Friendship and helping each other out with our passion projects which lead to organic feelings. When together, the feelings of being on another planet together and when apart, returning to Earth. These feelings from start to finish were quick lived and by the middle of the summer it was all over. Unexpected. For the first time in more than 5 years I had felt feelings for someone so strong that there were no other thought in mind &amp; then, nothing. All of a sudden.

  
I was shattered, broken, lost. How did I go from focusing on my passions everyday to then still focusing on my passions but being broken. From that time until 6 months ago, I was numb. I self induced myself with Alcohol Daily. Marijuana Daily, with both becoming a necessity. Still, I was focused. Focused on my passions and what fuelled me from day to day. Heartbreak, let me tell you wasn't expected. It was something that came out of left field but was meant for my process and journey. It allowed me to go through all of the feelings, as well as none at all in the same moment, due to my numbing, to now being healed with those feelings and being one with myself. 

  
Putting love into myself everyday, spending time with myself and releasing the need to be around people all the time. As well as needing the fulfillment from others, I am healing. Its a practice day to day that I am still learning on how to be more present with myself and for the special ones around me. 

  
Going through heartbreak has no ""right"" way to heal from. It was doing what was best for me, which will be different from yours. I am here for you. I am here to listen. 

  
I love you.

2020-11-22 15:43:04,jyxnep,0,1,"I have lots of info on my profile but I want to introduce myself. I'm a pretty outlandishly austere lady who wants to live a simple life with another girl, build a little house together out in the woods and make the most of it... maybe even invite other people to build if we have any more land at some point. 

My sister died in a traumatic accident when I was only nearly four years old, she was seven. The trauma was widespread and severe, altering my behavior for my whole life. Only after nine months on hormones (I was shamed by society into not coming out for a looooong time) I've found the pain inside my head and see its shape and can try to heal it (but only with the help of someone really special and close... Heh). It's quite physically painful honestly, it feels like a handful of broken glass or a bunch of scar tissue from a bullet wound right there in the side of my head. 

By the way, I don't take kindly to people sidestepping me and undermining my entire personality and sense of self by suggesting I see a therapist as soon as I mention I have PTSD. It's ridiculously offensive and I simply cannot tolerate it. In short, it triggers me a whole ton and I'm not open to any suggestions unless it's my love running her fingers along the side of my head or something simple like that. 

I used to be an EMT and that didn't help at all... I threw my back out, and it all nearly ended the third week I was there when I was nearly crushed to death and narrowly avoided injury. I worked a lot of overtime and did some really crazy things. So... I'm pretty much retired from medicine and I've been trying to study programming... but the PTSD symptoms have been getting exacerbated by repeated failures as a result of other people's games while relationship-building. I can't take much more of people offering me a heart and then ripping it away for some reason... Some people might think this isn't gonna sound fair but you have to understand it hurts me a lot...

I'm a non-op trans woman, I'm very happy with who I am. People around me really compressed my gender dysphoria and made me hold it in until I wasn't even aware it's what was going on, so it only got worse for quite a few years. I'm also a lesbian. This means a thing or two to me it doesn't for other people. I'm only interested in other trans women and I wouldn't be able to have a partner who isn't non-op too. I'm just warning you all of this ahead of time in case somebody here wants to get to know me. I'm also not open to any suggestions about my preference and sexuality. 

I'm very independent and tough and self reliant. My parents were really mean to me my whole childhood and I ended up being thrown out at the ripe age of 18. From there I travelled the country with a guitar in my hands, slept in several freezing cold puddles and sorta got all my travelling done if you know what I mean. What I'd really like is to have a mature relationship... Just to settle down with another woman like me; maybe another late bloomer, or someone with their own trauma and they'd like to deal with it together nice and close.

I'm gonna repeat myself, I'm into off-the-grid living. For me it's the lifestyle. And even if I lived on a fantasy commune I'd want to be pretty far away from the rest of the people 😅. I'd like to have some farm animals, a little wood stove, maybe a garden (grow some really good weed 😋) and just to be able to be able to read, all snuggled up and warm by the candlelight with someone by my side. Of course we don't need to get rid of the internet but I'm not gonna lie I get a little bit sick of looking at it, almost as sick as I am of a lot of the stuff that goes on in the city.

Soo I was afab and the past 2 years I've been questioning my gender and I know that I'm not female. However, I spent 18 years of my life thinking that I was (and also that I was a lesbian), so it's been a part of my identity. Especially the lesbian part. Well, Idk if I'm nonbinary or ftm but I'm definitely transmasc. I'm just so confused bc I want to be seen/pass as a boy, I want to look and sound like one. But somehow I still have this connection to womanhood like friendships among girls, girls loving girls, struggles women face etc and this confuses me bc I'm not a girl anymore and I don't use the term lesbian anymore bc now it feels wrong. I'm just so confused what this means concerning my gender. Does this connection to womanhood exist in ftm people? Or is this an indicator that I'm nonbinary? Does my rambling even make sense? (if not, tell me please!) Like I don't want to let go of all of this but at the same time, I want to live as a boy which is kinda conflicting. Idk.

2020-11-23 00:54:52,jz7iit,14,1,"So I have this problem with dating women now...  
Before I had trouble meeting any women at all, but once I had met someone, almost all the time we started dating for a longer period of time. Sex wasn't a first time thing, things like this always took their time and I was okay with that..you know, I respect the wishes of my partner or the person that I'm dating.

But now it's really weird. I dated 3 lesbian/bi women so far since my transition (2 cis, 1 trans) and there seems to be weird pattern now. Sex is a thing that happens MUCH quicker now and I don't even took the initiative most of the times.   
But after 1-2 months all of them started to ghost me. (I didn't date them simultaneously ofc)  
Two of them started to met other people (men) and then showing up with their guys or just telling me causally that they met someone new.  
The last girl I met has now ghosted me to the point, that she ignores most of what I text her, without replying anything negative about me or us at all.

Could be me, but I really don't get bi/lesbian dating culture. It seems it's all is about sex and emotions are forbidden? Idk..

Through it all, We Are Still Here. I have always had a difficult time during these months with less &amp; less warmth as well as sunshine which is needed on a daily basis. Its difficult to find sunshine internally on a day to day basis but its possible through day to day practice.

  
Especially now during these times where we are all locked inside, we have the time to truly focus on ourselves, on our well being. It starts with doing 1 thing a day. 1 thing for ourself, which ultimately with practice will lead to mandatory and necessity for ourselves everyday. 

  
It isn't figured out. I don't have it figured out but the most I can do is try and my best. Lately, I have been journaling ALL my feelings, the ups, the downs, the uglies and everything in between which has allowed me to release the internalization that I have allowed myself to struggle with my whole life. I as well as make sure that I am outside doing something active for at least 30 minutes a day, walking, sitting in nature, being present in the moment and getting away from the digitalized work we are ALL connected to. 

  
Meditation. Daily breathing techniques that allow me to take time for myself and truly breathe and be present. It started with focusing for 30 seconds, then a minute, then 2 minutes, then 3 .....you get where this is going. Remember, when meditating there is no RIGHT Way, but only What is RIGHT for you. Meditation is about maintaining presence, so that could be looking at flowers outside, looking at a tree, watching birds fly, sitting in the field, anything. Anything to maintain presence to allow yourself to enjoy the very moment that we have all been given, together, separately.

  
Today: Give yourself a big ol hug. I mean it. Hug yourself right now. Tight &amp; feel the love we all need for ourselves right now.

2020-11-23 18:41:10,jznkbd,6,1,"I'm a 30 year old male who struggled with my sexuality and gender 14 years ago. I met my girlfriend and put aside all my conflicts and lived a normal life. 
I'm currently in therapy for depression. I confessed many of my deepest darkest secrets and confessions to my therapist about my failing relationship, secret online relationships to older men when I was a teen, horrible self views of my physical appearance, and how when I crossed dressed once for Halloween I felt happiness that stayed with me forever.  And many, many more confessions.
My therapist thinks I am transgender. 
This feels like a truth that I dont want to accept, I am full of fear and doubt. 
I am a father, I have a son, and a second child in development. 
I know if I come out, everything will change. I will lose my partner most assuredly. 
Will I confuse my children? 

Is it worth transitioning, knowing full well that it will completely disrupt the lives of all my loved ones? I do not have self hatred, and can absolutely live the rest of my life as a man. Yes, I may not be as happy but the happiness of all those around me would stay the same. 

I dont know how to handle my doubt either. I'm afraid to even accept I am transgender, afraid that perhaps I'm doing it for the wrong reasons. I am depressed, feel unattractive, and in a toxic relationship that has lasted 15 years.

I've been having some feelings lately that are somewhat new, and in other ways familiar
I'm hoping people in this community might be able to relate and provide some guidance
All my life, I've never been uncomfortable being male. To be honest, I never really had any sort of relationship with my ""gender identity."" In high school, about 14 years old, I saw Rocky Horror Picture Show for the first time. And Tim Curry was my hero. This fit-bodied man, all fitted in drag and decked out in makeup. I stole my mother's mascara and eyeshadow and I would try it on in secret. I tried to hide what I was doing. I think she knew, but if she did, she would not have wanted to talk about it. After that year I moved to a small, rural town in West Virginia. Taking the opportunity to start over in a new place, I wore eye makeup to school and was ridiculed. After a month or two, I stopped. For a few years after high school, my life was very chaotic due to an extremely toxic relationship and a string of bad decisions. I wouldn't have had the breathing room to think about myself if I'd thought I needed to. Things have calmed down. I've put everything back in order. But now... there's this girl at my work. I try not to stare, but... she looks so fragile. Like a little bird. And it makes me feel helpless. Helpless because I can't look like that, even though I feel like that. I could lose all the weight I want and put on all the makeup she does but my shoulders are broad, my jawline is angular and my hips are narrow. No one will ever look at me like I look at her. Not that I could never be attractive. I consider myself to be fairly attractive, actually. But I could never be beautiful the way she is. And, not that I know what to do with this feeling at all, but that bugs the absolute shit out of me. And I feel just like I did years ago. But that makes so many things complicated! If I were to look like that, if I were to walk that road, to change my hair and my clothing, I'd be paying a high cost. Because I'm not uncomfortable being male and I'm not sure I'm ready for that to change. But unless I pass as female more convincingly, I'm looking at a lot of negative attention. Im also predominantly heterosexual, and as much as it's uncomfortable for me to be slotted into male romantic roles, I'm bringing a lot more difficulty onto myself by asking someone to even understand their attraction to a creature like that if it was there in the first place. 
I've started looking into HRT. Listening to testimonials. Noting the results. And... that's such a fantasy. But I hate the idea of putting ANYTHING into my body that's not there naturally. The only medication I take is a multivitamin. When I started experiencing quickly worsening mental health as a result of the aforementioned toxic period of my life, I started studying eastern religion and meditating like it was going out of style. And I beat those negative feelings into submission! But that being said, I see what some people are able to accomplish with HRT... is it expensive? Is it easy to get involved with that kind of thing? How often do you take the blockers? I'm not looking to make any decisions right now, but it'd be good to know my options.  I know I've got lots of questions and I apologize for the mawkish rambling.

2020-11-24 02:43:38,jzwigb,0,1,"Hi! I’m James, considering changing my name to something less masculine. I’m a 17 yo demigirl (please notif if under 18 posts aren’t allowed) and I recently came to the conclusion that I was demi, I love the idea of presenting more feminine. I love the feeling of dresses, makeup, etc. and I even see appeal in getting HRT. It’s just that exploring that part of myself comes off as really scary. I know I have to be true to myself and be who I need to be, but it feels like I’m stuck. I live with parents who couldn’t truly understand me, especially my father, and I’m in a backwards southern country that is extremely homophobic (I can’t even get an LGBT therapist) so it truly feels like I’m stuck, like my life is frozen.

How do you cope with being a sapphic/lesbian/wlw trans women?

I am a trans woman, age 21, who hopefully will be starting HRT during this winter break. It took me a long while and some uncomfortable experimentation to learn that I was not bi or pan as I thought throughout high school, but sapphic. I only started calling myself bi/pan about a year before I came to terms with myself being trans, and I believe my brain was subconsciously conforming to heteronormal ideas. ""If I'm a woman, I should be attracted to men."", my lizard brain thought, ""This is just how all women are supposed to feel about seeing and sleeping with guys"". It took me three years to figure out just how wrong I was.

Rediscovering my sexual identity has been very liberating as I no longer have to force myself to try and feel any form of romantic or sexual attraction towards men. At the same time, the anxiety from being a trans women who loves other women has been staggering.

Trans people, especially trans women, are often labeled as sexual predators by bigots and those who are underexposed to diversity. I don't need to tell you about the decades of fearmongering surrounding bathrooms specifically. The false propaganda that trans women want to use women's restrooms to assault other women is still prevalent to this day. To a lesser extent, I have seen this same discriminatory idea applied to lesbians as well. Straight trans women have the defense that they're only attracted to men, and therefore they don't find women attractive (not a waterproof argument, but better than nothing). But I and other sapphic trans women can't use that because we *do* feel attraction towards women who's bathrooms we'd like to use. In some ways we fit the description that transphobes use in their bigotry. The same ""logic"" was employed whenever I saw a gay classmate bullied in the men's locker room in middle school.

This all extends beyond bathrooms and into every aspect of relationships. The guilt I feel for finding other women attractive leads to the relentless anxiety that I may be viewed as a predator: a man masquerading in order to take advantage of lesbians. These transphobic ideas are ingrained even into my mind and it can be impossible to tell if others are the same, even allies.

I would like to have a partner, a wife, someday. I would like to be able to adopt a child with them. But until I can learn how to cope with this fear of predation that future looks unlikely.

My female friends have showered me with their old bags, clothes (most of which fit perfectly) and makeup they didn't use anymore.

My employer even made it possible for me to switch jobs from working in the workshop to back office.

I am presenting femme full time and have never gotten any comments from strangers, except for a few weird looks.

My confidence and feeling of self worth have skyrocketed and I have literally never been better.

The only thing that didn't go well from get-go were my hormone supplements. I had a very bad allergic reaction to the pads I was given, but haven't had any problems since I've switched to pills.

I know that I'm extremely lucky to have such a supporting and loving environment but I wanted to tell everyone that there's positivity out there!

When I was in primary school, I had a best friend for all seven years but we ended up going to different high schools. I could never contact him as he didn’t seem to have any social media at all, so I haven’t (and still haven’t) spoken to him again in five years.

About a month ago, I saw him at the bus station. I wanted to go chat but I didn’t know how to since it’s been so long since we last spoke. 
Then, around three days ago, he followed me on Instagram, and he is now an amazing artist which didn’t surprise me at all because he loved to draw, and wanted to be an artist since we were younger. I noticed in his bio he now goes by he/him pronouns which I completely respect and admire him for. 

The only problem is, on his social media he doesn’t mention his name at all, and his best friends from high school still refer to him as the name he had in primary school (I know them through college). If I ever run into him again, and get to talk to him, my worst nightmare would be to accidentally deadname him, or offend him in any way.

So, (sorry for the ramble) how should I go about asking his name? I really don’t want to offend him. I don’t even know for sure what his gender identity is, but I can’t think of how to ask without coming off as impolite or nosy, especially after five years :(

So my girlfriend (MTF 23) and I (MTF 22) have been dating for 6 months now and it’s a month before Christmas. I had been planning on proposing to her for a while now and I was originally going to do it on New Year’s Eve in front of my family. But the other night she told me all about how Christmas is her new favorite holiday since she came out. So it dawned on me that I should do it on Christmas. We already have a plan that I’ll spend Christmas Eve and morning with my family and then we’ll meet up in the afternoon. I’m going to ask her if I can order her a gift and have it sent to my mom’s because it’s so big I can’t hide it from her. But in reality it’s the gift, a trans flag, AND the rings. My mom has the rings at her house and I’ll be taking them back with me from thanksgiving. My current plan is to give her the flag on Christmas in front of my sister who is our roommate. I’ll then ask her to take some pics of us with it, and after she takes a few I’ll signal for her to start recording. I’ll tell my gf I have another gift before launching into a little monologue about how much I love her. Finally I’ll get down as I talk and pop the question.

Recently, at my work, a trans man has been hired. He has a button on his shirt that says his pronouns (he/him). I have noticed twice that a few customers have labeled him as ""she"" in pure spite of the button, despite the fact that if he where to not have the button you could not really tell that he is trans-gender. 

This made me mad, more than him surprisingly. However, I dont speak anything political with coworkers at my job for safety. I was curious to know if it would be encouraged for other coworkers (despite sex) have buttons stating their pronouns. Would this be rude in the eyes of my coworker? I imagine it would make members of the trans community feel safter/less alienated. I could be wrong!

If this sounds like a good idea, where can I find ""reliable trans sources"" that could help me make an argument for this to be a part of my companies uniform? My company is pretty progressive, and I beleive that if I made a strong enough argument I could have substantial impact.

If you want to know more about my story, I made a post about it on r/DysphoriaClinic but for a shortened version, I noticed some signs I could be trans in myself and so I decided to explore it further by telling my friends and asking them to use female pronouns and call me by a new name: Arienne. I liked it a lot and started questioning myself and my identity, which I never really had done before.

I've done some more research on the topic and some introspection and I've found that I don't exhibit many traits of dysphoria. I'm fine in my body right now, and I've been content with that for a long time. If I were to live as who I am now for the rest of my life I feel like I would be able to and get along just fine. However, whenever I think about being a girl I get a feeling like I would be happier that way. I've dreamt about it several times, I play female characters in most video games I play, and now my friends act like I'm a girl. I can't help but think I would be happier as a girl.

I've been struggling as a transwoman for awhile now. I grew up in a place where I would have been shot had I been public, and have had a many numerous encounters with people wishing I would die/or be killed..... Needless to say I'm in therapy.... lots of therapy. Was very recently almost murdered again by my cousin's husband and that sent me into a bit of a downward spiral for a bit and have been really struggling overall to accept myself for who I am and who I deeply desire to be. My cousin is very supportive of me being trans, one of the few in my life, but is dealing with some very serious health issues and a failing marriage so life is still pretty chaotic for us both. 

However despite this recent attack, I've been making some really big breakthroughs about the risks of being out to the world, and to start making the steps in the direction to make that possible. I've been doing a lot of reading and research into what I should expect and ways to handle it, but it seems no matter how much I read it is never enough. It's been a long journey to get where I am, and am finally at a place in my life where I actually want to live, and to keep pushing to find out what is out there and hopefully find some form of happiness for myself. I'm not expecting a miracle, I know it will be a long and painful road, but I now know that it is what I truly want and need to accept myself for myself, flaws and all. 

I'm at the starting line when it comes to learning to ""pass"" and would appreciate any support regarding learning how to accomplish that. I have only recently made an account in order to learn more about others experiences and am glad to have found a resource for trans folks. Things are still extremely difficult and hard to deal with, but for the first time in my life I have hope for the future. 

If anyone's made it this far into this post.....thanks for reading! It wasn't meant to be this long, but it turned into a bit of a venting/self reflection session. Maybe I should take up journalling or something its somewhat cathartic. Anyways wish everyone out there a wonderful day, and a safe and secure transition.

You are an amazing person. You deserve compassion and love. You deserve to be happy and you deserve to love yourself. Give yourself some space for self care and compassion.

I'm a cis male and am very aware that I could potentially be viewed as representing some element of the trans community by certain people. As such I'm determined to represent someone dealing with dysphoria in an honest and accurate way.

The character in the play deals primarily trying to get their parents to accept their decision and explaining their dysphoria to them. I'm wondering if any of you would be kind enough to talk to me about the emotions and experiences you went through or are going through, when dealing with this.

Equally if anyone's willing to talk to me about dealing with their parents and the ensuing difficulties I'd be incredibly grateful.

I apologise if I'm at all coming off as intrusive or overbearing. I subscribe fairly rigidly to the Stanislavsky school of acting, of which research and a complete understanding of how your character is viewed both by themselves and others is essential.

Please feel free to message me privately if you don't want to talk publicly. I'm also taking this an opportunity to educate myself as much as possible, so feel free to point out if I've made any horrible blunders at all.

It is all Valid. It is about the balance that is maintained, which has a different way of showing itself on a day to day basis.

I used to think and still am giving the space to allow myself to realize that balance is more than 50% on 1 thing and 50% on another. Balance looks like: 60/30/10, 20/40/40, 20/50/30 etc. Everyday the maintaining of balance will be different to the day prior and the day ahead, all we have is right **NOW**. This present moment.

Going into a 2nd lockdown, we have now been given the added time and added space to focus on ourselves heavily again. It can be difficult, I totally understand. Some days are harder for me as well, but this is what is going on and we have to learn to **EMBRACE** it. That is the only choice we have. It starts with changing one habit, one routine that feels like its gotten too grounded, too stuck in place. Remember we are the humans that create our habits and routines, instead of vice versa, which is something I feel like we forget.

Our habits and routines can become so connected to our comfort zone that, that is all we think there is, when our life can constantly changed everyday. Switching morning routines around can allow for more time for ourselves, even if its doing the same things but in different order.

Today: Pay it Forward. Tell Someone you Love them. Share with someone something you learned. Get Fresh Air into your Beautiful Lungs. Focus on you and release the need of focusing solely on others.

2020-11-27 08:45:41,k1xlin,3,1,"Hi everyone,

First off, I hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving. This post is going to be a bit long, so, sorry about that. I need to tell a group of people who I am and finally get this off my shoulders.

So, this is me finally coming out of the closet to myself. I've denied it for so many years (I'm 29 now. Better late than never). As a kid growing up, I always knew something was off (I come from a catholic family and I never heard of trans people until I was a teenager. So, as a kid I could never explain how I was feeling and I honestly thought I was crazy). Looking back it was so obvious. It started when I was young. I had a cousin (not much older than me) and we grew up very close. She was an only child and My brother and I played with her all the time as kids. The first sign was when we'd have family gatherings. I'd hang out with her and a couple of other close female family relatives my age. As I got older, going into my teens, I had a lot of friends who were cheerleaders and I always wanted to be one (I know cliche but it's true). I knew I would've been the laughing stock of the entire school, Made fun of, called names, and I was still trying to prove I was a guy. So, I joined the football team (I was terrible). When it came to dating women I just couldn't. I always said to myself well I'm introverted and I'll date in college. When I would make attempts to date in college it never worked. I just couldn't put into words why. I'd go to friends of mine much more successful at dating than me and they'd tell me to do this or You're just nervous that's normal. After a while, I just gave up and told myself I need to be successful at school. I'm genuinely a career-oriented person. After graduating from college, I buried myself in my work. After 5 years of doing a job, I thought I liked when I started but ended up hating, I switch careers to Computer Programming and I might go back to school for it. I was stupidly lucky and got an entry-level job just based on what I knew and read about programming. With all of the time I've had working from home, all of these memories came back to me and after more failed attempts at dating, I had a realization. I was disinterested in dating women. I have about 20 or so tinder matches right now, about 30 or so on other dating apps and the only ones I'm talking to are the ones who messaged me first. Also, I've been into guys (another Obvious sign that I ignored). So I finally just for the hell of it to prove I was right about 3 days ago I bought some women's clothes put them on and It just felt right to me.

So I need to ask for some advice?

1. I'm almost sure I'm a Trans woman, but, I've been reading about other gender identities as well and bigender is something I think sounds like I might fall under it. When You started your journey. Did you have any doubts that maybe you were not trans, that you fell under another gender identity, and how did you come to that conclusion?

This post is going to be a bit long, so, sorry about that. I need to tell a group of people who I am and finally get this off my shoulders.\n\nSo, this is me finally coming out of the closet to myself. I've denied it for so many years (I'm 29 now. Better late than never). As a kid growing up, I always knew something was off (I come from a catholic family and I never heard of trans people until I was a teenager. So, as a kid I could never explain how I was feeling and I honestly thought I was crazy). Looking back it was so obvious. It started when I was young. I had a cousin (not much older than me) and we grew up very close. She was an only child and My brother and I played with her all the time as kids. The first sign was when we'd have family gatherings. I'd hang out with her and a couple of other close female family relatives my age. As I got older, going into my teens, I had a lot of friends who were cheerleaders and I always wanted to be one (I know cliche but it's true). I knew I would've been the laughing stock of the entire school, Made fun of, called names, and I was still trying to prove I was a guy. So, I joined the football team (I was terrible). When it came to dating women I just couldn't. I always said to myself well I'm introverted and I'll date in college. When I would make attempts to date in college it never worked. I just couldn't put into words why. I'd go to friends of mine much more successful at dating than me and they'd tell me to do this or You're just nervous that's normal. After a while, I just gave up and told myself I need to be successful at school. I'm genuinely a career-oriented person. After graduating from college, I buried myself in my work. After 5 years of doing a job, I thought I liked when I started but ended up hating, I switch careers to Computer Programming and I might go back to school for it. I was stupidly lucky and got an entry-level job just based on what I knew and read about programming. With all of the time I've had working from home, all of these memories came back to me and after more failed attempts at dating, I had a realization. I was disinterested in dating women. I have about 20 or so tinder matches right now, about 30 or so on other dating apps and the only ones I'm talking to are the ones who messaged me first. Also, I've been into guys (another Obvious sign that I ignored). So I finally just for the hell of it to prove I was right about 3 days ago I bought some women's clothes put them on and It just felt right to me.\n\nSo I need to ask for some advice?\n\n1. I'm almost sure I'm a Trans woman, but, I've been reading about other gender identities as well and bigender is something I think sounds like I might fall under it. When You started your journey. Did you have any doubts that maybe you were not trans, that you fell under another gender identity, and how did you come to that conclusion?\n2. When you started to admit who you were and that you didn't fall under that gender identity that you were assigned at birth. Did you come right out to everyone or did you wait until you were 100% certain of who you were? I know for a fact I'm not coming out right now to anyone (well except for Reddit).

I'm going to start by saying I know the struggles of your outsides not matching the insides, the pain of catching a mirror and it snapping you out of the blissful ignorance of forgetting how you look.
Dysphoria is a fucker I get it, and as such I support you in any of your endeavours that make that pain easier, that could be in simply wearing different clothes or it could be surgery.
You do you. You have my support and I love you.

Now here's the but;
What I do not support and what is not okay, is fraud.
That could be stealing someone else's pictures from the internet and posing as them (I mean this is pretty weak, and you will probably get called out http://imgur.com/a/x6yseSg),
but equally, it could be trying to fool other people with faceapp and 'filters' that change the shape of your face (I don't think a filter should change anything other than colour and shadow/highlight).

I understand that those photo's might make you feel better, I get it. I've done it. But they never saw the light of day online, because they are not the truth.
They are a lie.
You are farming karma for your dysphoria at the expense of worsening the dysphoria of folks who's appearance does not yet match what their minds see. Some people are not savvy or eagle eyed enough to spot the hallmarks of digital augmentation, but many of us who know see your bullshit and need it to stop.
It sets unrealistic expectations, not just for what can be achieved with hormones, but also for what can be achieved with surgery... The ""Endgame"".

Not only this, but it also feeds the unhealthy expectation that everyone should look cis AF.
Which is precisely the same bullshit that breeds dysphoria in the first instance.

I'm well aware that this will probably get slammed into the dirt as controversial, but I can't be the only one here who feels saddened by digital facelift crew.
If you post a pic and you tell us you used an app, you are gorgeous and untouchable here, your honesty with yourself and others is the quality the world needs.

2020-11-27 13:36:40,k21803,5,1,"Tldr: my sister came out to me yesterday (she's MtF 23) I want any sagely advice from this community on how to make her the most comfortable. Obviously, I need to keep open communication with her, but I want to be a perfect ally to her as much as humanly possible. I have several trans friends and am aware of basic etiquette, but would love to hear what anyone here has to say to make sure I'm being as respectful and kind as I can be for her and my other friends too. Thank you

My sister (MtF 23) came out to me yesterday after Thanksgiving dinner. I have a few trans friends and have had a few people in my life come out to me over text, which is great from my perspective, because it's nice to have a second to construct a nice response congratulating a person, confirming preferred pronouns and proper name, acceptable terms of endearment, ask who knows and who doesn't so I don't out them, and asserting that my love isn't conditional whatsoever. That I'll be a fierce ally and supporter and that I'm available to talk about whatever. And to be able to read it over and make sure it's all exactly what they need to hear and what I need to know to make them the most comfortable.

It was really brave of her to tell me, especially in person. And I was a bit surprised, honestly, but quickly recovered and had a little chat about the above--pronouns, name, etc and that I was happy she told me and asked if it was okay to tell my husband, which she agreed it was. We hugged and that was that.


I wanted to give the little back story basically to ask if there's anything this community would recommend I can do to make things the most comfortable for her. As I said, my sister is not the first trans person I've ever known, but she's the closest person to me.

I have several trans friends and am aware of basic etiquette, but would love to hear what anyone here has to say to make sure I'm being as respectful and kind as I can be for her and my other friends too. Thank you\n\nMy sister (MtF 23) came out to me yesterday after Thanksgiving dinner. I have a few trans friends and have had a few people in my life come out to me over text, which is great from my perspective, because it's nice to have a second to construct a nice response congratulating a person, confirming preferred pronouns and proper name, acceptable terms of endearment, ask who knows and who doesn't so I don't out them, and asserting that my love isn't conditional whatsoever. That I'll be a fierce ally and supporter and that I'm available to talk about whatever. And to be able to read it over and make sure it's all exactly what they need to hear and what I need to know to make them the most comfortable.\n\nIt was really brave of her to tell me, especially in person. And I was a bit surprised, honestly, but quickly recovered and had a little chat about the above--pronouns, name, etc and that I was happy she told me and asked if it was okay to tell my husband, which she agreed it was. We hugged and that was that.\n\n\nI wanted to give the little back story basically to ask if there's anything this community would recommend I can do to make things the most comfortable for her. As I said, my sister is not the first trans person I've ever known, but she's the closest person to me. We're pretty close and I love her dearly and just want to make things as painless as possible for her.

My question is, if I come out as soon as I move there, and then report to a medical professional that I’ve had dysphoria for over a year, does that count towards the year I have to wait before getting prescribed HRT, or would I have to be publicly presenting as female for that whole duration? 

Related question: how many people do I need to be out to for it to count? right now the only person I am out to is my therapist, who is a nice lady but doesn’t know any more than me about trans issues. Would a note from her saying I’ve been out to her for a year be enough to get prescribed?

Quite recently it has dawned on me that I\'ve been openly trans for a decade at this point, give or take a few months. This realization has spurred me on to reflect on my journey, and how it\'s changed and taught me many things. There was a lot of hardship for me at first. When I was a teen it seriously considered it to be a curse, another hardship to bear. As I\'m sure we all do I faced a lot of discrimination, and attacks. Those incidents compounded with my lack of experience with the Healthcare system made every day a struggle to just be okay with who I am. As I aged things became a lot easier, I learned to pass (which I feel blessed for) I was still pretty constantly terrified or paranoid about discrimination. Hrt was a huge battle for me, I repeatedly stopped and started due to money, insurance, or living in a rural area. Until I reached the age of about 23 I very much considered being trans as just another heavy burden to carry along with the rest of my crap. After continuous conversations with myself, my husband, and my allies, I realized how magnificent, and beautiful it is to be trans. Each day is a joy to me at this point, hrt has been hugely helpful, but the ultimate source of joy for me has really been my own relationship with my trans nature. When I was younger I shunned all elements of masculinity in myself that I could, and it wasn\'t til recently that I realized that those elements of myself are beautiful too and meant to be embraced and cherished. This unity of masculinity and femininity I believe is a real gift. It makes relating to people much easier, and more fulfilling.\xa0 The hardship of finding this beautiful dichotomy has given me the skills and emotional fortitude to face any issue with open arms and for this, I am profoundly grateful. So many of my relationships have grown so much thanks to being trans as well. It has also really (seemingly ironically) made me truly appreciate the goodness in people, many members of my family have completely shocked me with their support, love, and kindness, despite rampant conservatism, and transphobia in their social circles. There are so many ways that I find this path we all walk to be truly beautiful, despite my inability to capture it in words. I don\'t know if anyone else has experiences similar to this, but I thought I would share my story. I hope this helps, and I would very much love it if you shared some of your ""it\'s beautiful to be trans"" experiences with me.\nLyra', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Essay: Curse or super power', 'created': 1606517323.0}"

So, last night I grabbed a few things and ran out the door after my mom tried to have another ""conversation"" with me about being respectful--by which she meant never talking about being trans ever again.

I've had a hard time with coming to terms with what happened and slowly began opening up to her after over a decade of persistence on her end. I finally feel that she's proven her interest in being in my life so I decided to trust her with something important, something I'd only ever told the older brother I look up to. 

Because of what happened I have very few strong memories of my early life, consistent memories only start for me around 6th grade. For a long time I've felt that I missed out on who I was as a kid and I felt I needed to ask anyone who would know. I knew asking would require opening up and letting my mom back into my heart. I couldn't in good conscience ask so much without giving something important in return you know? 

So I did it! Just went out with it and said ""This is me, coming out to my mom as a trans-girl."" I must have sounded so bashful. ^^' She told me she loved me no matter what and that she'd always hoped for a daughter :D I cried. A lot haha It felt like unlocking a sealed door and relief flooded in. Slowly the good started to shine brighter than the bad and felt I could begin finding the happy memories I'd so wished to have all along. 

She asked for pictures and hoped to visit after all this pandemic mess is cleaned up. I know it's a huge shock and will take her some time to come to terms with things, she even apologized when she habitually called me her son! I still don't feel like I can 100% relax though.

Ever since I was young I alwaysed like growing my hair out but every once in a while my parents made me cut it.
I like to make costumes and sew, as well as play video games and sing, dance, and do theatre.
I never have been into sports at all, when I was forced to as all young kids are, I just picked at the grass.

2020-11-28 00:49:13,k2dj7l,2,1,"(23 YO)It was only a month ago ,early October that I confronted  myself on my gender dysphoria and my depression but it feels like so much longer, I had been considering hormones for over a year at that point and needless to say this year has been hard for so many people , tripping up so many peoples lives and plans, forcing everyone to stop, isolate and ponder while your own and everyone’s life casually burned to the ground out your window. Now I sit here , stuck with my family for thanksgiving a family who I’ve confided my desire to transition to and who brushed it off as a phase . Still not one step closer to getting on HRT and now I worry I was wrong, part of me simply can’t forget this deep desire to be feminine that’s haunted my mind since I was 12 , but part of me can’t bring myself to take the leap , everything about it scares me, and I don’t get scared, It is simply impossible to comprehend how much this would change my life, I don’t know what the social landscape of America is gonna be in 6months, I don’t know how I’m going to pay for a basic adult life let alone Hrt, I don’t know how/where to get a job.

I've recently accepted that I'm trans (maybe nb? not sure) and i think that i want to transition (mtf) but I'm not sure about a few things.

Im over 6ft tall and have some very masculine features. I'm very nervous and scared to transition because i feel like i would never pass as a girl. Im also nervous because i guess i am relatively attractive now and I'm afraid I'd never be the same if i transitioned. I feel like I'd never really look like a girl and that would matter a lot to me..

I guess my question is how do y'all feel comfortable with yourselves? I know that people tend to be very encouraging here but I'm still wondering if there is a possibility that i would never pass.

I'd love some advice or help if anyone can provide that.

Over the past year, she has come out to me as trans and begun exploring that side of herself, and I could not be happier. Seeing the way she lights up when she tries on some feminine clothes or I help her with her makeup literally brings tears to my eyes. Anyways okay I could gush about her for hours but that's not the point here. 

She's not out publicly yet, mostly because of her career. I want to show her that she's always free to be herself at home and that I support her no matter what. So I decided this year to get her a trans pride ornament for our tradition. I've looked on Amazon, but I didn't really see any I liked, and I would also really prefer to get it from a small business. Especially one thats LGBT+ owned. If you own one or know someone who does, please drop me a link! Thank you so much!

Which makes me doubt if i am trans because some girls wouldn’t care about their career and go for it no matter what. \n\nPlus my parents have helped me w $ before and during the pandemic and I’m so guilty because I’d rather them use that for helping me transition and cover meds etc. but i haven’t told them anything. I’m kinda of asking like, how did you all make that final determination and also, with your careers how did coming out affect that?

Sorry I'm kinda dumb with this stuff, I've had people say im supposed to see a therapist and if they think hormones will help them I'll get to use hormones.

     But I don't know how to find that kind of therapist? am I supposed to ask my doctor? My doc is at a bad clinic, they don't even have connections to hospitals (apparently cause that's what they told me when I asked about a hospital once). So I don't think they have that kind of resource? 

    is there like a online way to set up a first appointment with the therapist? Cause I'd like to have already started buy the time I'm 20. (I'm 18 rn, 19 in jan)

2020-11-29 01:06:15,k2zus9,4,1," So yeah. I can leave more context if anyone interacts, but I'll also leave some here. I'm 15 and have started to socially transition a little before the school year in the United States started (few months ago). I like being a dude, and I like everyone referring to me as a dude, but there are many reasons why I cant be trans.

1. These feelings only started a little after puberty. I was a very girly girl when I was younger, loved dresses and such. I could just be apart of the ""transgender craze"" in young afabs (and yes afabs are more likely to get diagnosed with gender dysphoria).
2. Im never going to completely pass until I'm 18+. Was painfully reminded of this a few days ago in a group that I never officially came out as trans in, but just said I was a dude. Can elaborate more if asked.
3. Health risks with me and my family. Transitioning brings many health risks for me, and it could cause many arguments amongst my family. My dad was just in the hospital for stress-related reasons and more arguments could make it worse.
4. I could just have other mental health issues going on. For a while, I was not in the best state of mind and I have not completely gone back to a healthy mindset.

I will not accept responses claiming I have internalized transphobia, but I would like to discuss some things.

2020-11-29 10:08:12,k372oe,3,1,"I should start off by saying that I am going to see a therapist pretty soon and I've discussed this with my parents as well. The reason I want to go to a therapist is that there are a couple of serious issues for me about transitioning, that everyone here has experienced and that I need input on.

First: If I go down this path, I want to be sure that my desire to become a woman does not stem from transvestic fetishism but from serious dysphoria because I don't want to regret my decision after doing something irreversible. I've tried to figure out if I am afflicted by just the fetish side of things because I do get 'happy' when I dress and when thinking about becoming a woman. Is there somewhat of a way I can tell or is it just a roll of the dice? I know a lot of people say you shouldn't transition if you're only sexually attracted to it but I think (I am not sure at all) that I am afflicted by both. I've always been drawn to being a woman from around 3\~4 if that means anything, but I can't tell if it's just sexual attraction or genuine desire. I'm scared of that :(

Second: If I am not happy with the way I look after the transition I don't know that I'll be able to live with myself. Currently, I believe that I could probably live out the rest of my life as a guy and make it by with bad, but manageable depression/anxiety. I could probably force myself to be okay as a guy and shut this side of me down, I've forced myself to be this way for 23 years so far so I could probably make it. However, If I transitioned and I looked in the mirror and saw a guy pretending to be a girl I cannot say that I would be able to manage that. This scares me too :(

These two issues are the biggest things holding me back (as they should) from going down this road and I know that I need to be sure before I do or else...

I know this is long, I hope this is the right sub. I need your most honest opinion and advice on transphobia. This post may come across as a bit selfish, but please, bear with me. (And also excuse my grammar, I come from a Slav country and it's my first language.)

I'm not a transgender person, I'm a cis woman (age 16), and I didn't think I was transphobic, but after a heated argument with my sister (age 17), she gave a few points that made me doubt myself.
My sister is bi, so she's more involved with the LGBTQ+ community than I am (she's not trans), admittedly knows more than me.
She asked about my opinions on neo pronouns and I wasn't even familiar with them. She explained it's as pronouns, but whatever people want them to be ang gave examples as ""xe or plague doctor, if u will, woof or skittles"". At first I said I don't think that's necessary, because I thought the he/she/it/they would be enough, and especially plague doctor will never become a pronoun (not that I wouldn't call a person xe or plague doctor if that's what they'd be comfortable with, I just didn't see it linguistically implemented as pronouns). -Admittedly, I was wrong there, bc he/she/it/they don't offer enough width for everyone, so I apologized for that, because it wasn't right. 
At that point I googled neo pronouns and the first thing that came up explained it with so much more sense than ""plague doctor"" and ""skittles"". I actually think that with time, ne, ve, ze, xe (if common enough) could be implemented as ""actual"" pronouns, because they also don't carry any other meaning as nouns. I said that her examples didn't make any sense and were as bad as the attack helicopter example for genders. At that point she called me transphobic bc that is a transphobic meme going around and most likely nobody uses it. I replied that that's exactly what I was saying and she kept saying I was transphobic for bringing it up.
I still don't believe any of her weird examples will become pronouns but will always remain in a separate category of neopronouns, linguistically (that mind u I would still use). And if there's infinite amount of neopronouns we can't always state them all as examples (when explaining or in dictionaries), but will still use them, if that's what the person would want.

Basically, I'm asking you, who can the most definitely tell me if I am transphobic and if yes, what do I have to change. Because I am not going to be one of those people thinking and believing I'm not transphobic and being that in reality.

I’m a nonbinary AMAB person who is strongly considering going on hormones, but I’m conflicted and nervous. I’m worried that going on hormones is going to...

1. Force me to come out to everyone close to me, thereby alienating me from some of my friends and family

2. Force me to deal with transphobia in a personal, direct manner in pretty much every aspect of my life

3. Cause psychological changes that may be unhealthy (currently dealing with depression, anxiety, and ADHD)

4. Make voice training a necessity (and what if I can’t pull it off?)

5. Deal with a body that isn’t what I expected or hoped for

6. Pay for the hormones out of pocket if my insurance doesn’t cover it

7. Can’t be a catboy 

On the other hand I think I would genuinely be happier living as a woman at this point in my life. I’ve never been happy being a guy physically, socially, psychologically, or sexually, and the few times I’ve been treated as a woman have made me very happy inside and out.

Just for clarification, I am cis so I wanted to get input from the transgender community and not talk over anybody or push my opinion into places where it does not belong. Please let me know if I’m being invasive or ignorant in any way, I am always learning and will be 100% receptive to any criticism.

My partner has a teenaged cousin, “Travis”. Travis is a trans guy and he is also extremely shy and introverted which is not helped by his unsupportive family. I’ve tried to very gently ask about his feelings on the incident that I’ll describe below, but as I said he’s very shy and it’s difficult to get him to open up so I haven’t really gotten a clear answer from him. I was just curious about other peoples’ thoughts on the situation  and absolutely do not want to overextend/insert myself.

My mother in law is a narcissist and she fetishizes the LGBT community (infantilism of gay men, groping strippers at a club because ‘she’s a woman so it’s okay’, wearing shirts that show how progressive she is, invading LGBT spaces because they’re “more fun”, etc) but is still homophobic and transphobic. She once told me that I better not “creep” on her because I’m queer, says the F word and says it’s okay because she has gay friends, and says “that transgender crap just doesn’t make sense” to her. I’ve tried to explain to her why all of this is absolutely not okay but not once has it worked and she usually doubles down with the offensive language.

Holidays are usually hosted at her home which has not been good for Travis since she is very obnoxious about not being supportive of him. She won’t respect his pronouns and last year she said “Let’s get a picture with all the ladies! [Deadname] come on, get in with us!” When he refused, she said “[deadname] don’t be a pill” and he eventually gave up and got in the picture as she wouldn’t let him photograph with the rest of the boys. I felt awful for him but I was worried that by calling her out, I would make him uncomfortable or anxious, which he already was.

My question is, what is the appropriate thing to do here? I can tell that it’s extremely hurtful to Travis and I feel complicit by not saying anything, but I also worry that I will put him at risk emotionally by saying something. As I said I tried to ask Travis what he would like us to do/say in these situations but he was feeling very defeated at the time and just slumped and said “it doesn’t matter, she’s always like this”.

2020-11-29 23:26:19,k3jvqj,6,1,"Hi people. Over the past 3-4 weeks I (24MtF) have ""come out"" and stopped repressing the self I have always felt I am. It feels great to have expressed myself to some trusted and loving members of the family and a couple of friends, and to have been accepted by nearly all.

I want to socially transition and to some extent (to what I am not yet sure) I want to medically transition. I have started socially transitioning in some small ways like trying makeup and female clothing, being more aware of how I carry myself and my speech.

I can't express how good it feels to really be doing it and it not being one of those things that I will die wishing I did. At the same time it's very scary. There are people I think I will lose. Thinking I am pretty unlikely to ""pass"" also makes for a tough look at it.

I have heard horror stories of unfortunate people that got as far as bottom surgery before de-transitioning. Social pressure is sadly the cause. Normally the article goes on to say that hundreds or even thousands of people that transition regret it afterwards and want to de-transition, but apparently most go unreported.

Of course some aspects of transitioning are permanent or may have permanent effects and going that far must sound scary to anyone - before you think of such horror stories and that you can't reverse irreversible.

I will not die wondering and will at least socially transition, but I want to go further. A good friend of mine (also trans) told me to ""never forget that being hot &gt; passing"" which always gives me hope.

Do you good people know anyone who has transitioned (to whatever extent) and de-transitioned, and why they did it? 

Do many people really regret their transition?

Is there any advice you would give to early days trans people, or helpful resources you know?

I'm queer and nonbinary trans. I'd come out to my fam as queer a long time ago, and they're ""accepting"" of it but it's that kind of acceptance that seems to be just... tolerating it while holding out hope I'll change my mind one day. For this reason, I'm not out as nb/trans to them, and I don't really have plans to ever be. 

But going by my deadname became intolerable, for a lot of reasons. Gender reasons were a big part of it, but also because some really traumatic things happened and I had to kind of build my life up from scratch again and I wanted a fresh start. I didn't really have a different name chosen so I started going by my middle name, which is relatively gender-neutral, so it was a lot easier for me, and wouldn't force me to out myself, because... well, lots of people go by their middle name. I figured that switching to my middle name would be a good 'compromise' that wouldn't cause too much family friction, but I was wrong. It's been the source of a lot of tension with my mom specifically, whom I used to have a good relationship with, because she pretty much refuses to respect it. At first she just said she needed time to get used to it, but it's been 2.5 years now things have only gotten more tense. 

She and I have been doing family therapy together recently and this name thing came up as a point of contention. The therapist was mostly trying to get my mom to respect my choices here, but the advice that our therapist gave her was that she needs to take time to ""mourn"" the use of my deadname and the person who that name represented. Although she was trying to help and was advocating for me in this instance, I can't help but feel uncomfortable with framing it that way. 

I've known I'm NB for upwards of 10 years now, and I don't feel like I died or became a different person when I decided to answer to a different name. If a woman gets married and takes her husband's name, do we act like she fucking died and mourn the person she was when she used her maiden name?

(This is going to be a little long, so I apologize in advance...)


I can't recall a single moment in my childhood were I had no trouble fitting in with people. This was partially to blame because of these weird feelings I had about myself, my body, and others.
I didn't fully understand them at the time, and most people reacted very badly when they came out, making me feel like there was something seriously wrong with me for a good chunk of my life.


In my teens, however, thanks to the undending love of my mom and the help from my awesome therapists, I got to understand what I felt, and why it wasn't wrong.


I've been out to those close to me as trans for almost a year now, and despite being really hard at times, I've never felt happier. The years that lead to this decision have taught me a lot about gender expression, queerness, the LGBTQ+ community and the person I am, either through direct experience or through my own research.


I just feel like I can do so much better, tho! My therapist is not exactly an expert in the subject (he's an ally and well informed), and I feel like I have so much more to learn about me and about what being trans/queer means.


Plus, there's the fact that it's becoming consistently harder to defend transgender matters and rights in my very conservative country... So I want to become sharper on the subject, so I can better shield and support myself and my trans friends.


Can you people recommend me what you consider essential on gender theory? Books, literature, scientific papers... I want it all if it isn't asking too much lmao

i (13nb) am writing a book from the perspective of a 14 yr old trans girl who just got kicked out by her dad. eventually she’s going to meet other lgbtq+ girls on the street and they start a gang together, but right now i need some help with the characteristics of my mc.

First off, about me. I am a straight cis guy. I live in a kind of conservative country but consider myself open-minded.

I never really cared that much about trans or any other spectrum of everything since I generally just accept how people live their life's. But during the last couple of months I found myself attracted to trans-women (not more or less than cis-women, for me a woman, be it trans- or cis- is a woman. Some cis arent my type, and so arent some trans). Since I do not know a lot about the subject, I wanted to inform myself and therefor turn to this community.
I am pretty shy about this and may come back for more questions.
Let's start with an easy one, which has mostly to do with the genitalia sadly and the private aspect about it.
I am now single for a couple of months and naturally scrolling through dating apps. I judge by cover in those (which still seems bad, but what else can you do in a dating app 🤷‍♂️).
When I get a match with a trans-woman I write normally and would like to date normally, go for a drink and so on, but I really do not wanna be surprised if the heat would turn up. (Maybe I am not open-minded, idk.)
But I would not consider asking if sb is post- or pre-op, since I do not ask cis-women neither about their genitals. How can I smoothly handle that situation?


Tldr: is there a short/smooth way to get to know if sb is post- or pre-op or should it better not be asked at all?

But during the last couple of months I found myself attracted to trans-women (not more or less than cis-women, for me a woman, be it trans- or cis- is a woman. Some cis arent my type, and so arent some trans). Since I do not know a lot about the subject, I wanted to inform myself and therefor turn to this community.\nI am pretty shy about this and may come back for more questions.\nLet's start with an easy one, which has mostly to do with the genitalia sadly and the private aspect about it.\nI am now single for a couple of months and naturally scrolling through dating apps. I judge by cover in those (which still seems bad, but what else can you do in a dating app 🤷\u200d♂️).\nWhen I get a match with a trans-woman I write normally and would like to date normally, go for a drink and so on, but I really do not wanna be surprised if the heat would turn up. (Maybe I am not open-minded, idk.)\nBut I would not consider asking if sb is post- or pre-op, since I do not ask cis-women neither about their genitals. How can I smoothly handle that situation?\n\n\nTldr: is there a short/smooth way to get to know if sb is post- or pre-op or should it better not be asked at all?\n(Please if you answer and only read the tldr, state that in your answer)"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'New to kinda everything', 'created': 1606762097.0}"

I had my 7 year HRT anniversary last year and I do really like myself after all this. When I came out I was a smoker working through some deep depression and voice training really wasn't something I had room for. Then after a few failed attempts, I set out this summer to do it right and make the most of the new resources out there..

I've been back at school doing my masters after a 5 year hiatus and literally just started my first professional job - hurray! But hearing my natural/deep voice echo on calls is so painful.. My partner suggests I try doing the voice more regularly and thinks I don't commit to it enough, she must be right due to my lack of progress, but I just don't have the emotional spoons to commit to feeling so much dumber when just being trans weighs on me so much. I already feel embarrassed about being a 6'5 trans woman despite looking otherwise cis-assumed, but regularly mis-gendered due to my height and voice I assume. I feel stupid that I can't get over this, that it makes me depressed, and then that I can't make progress on my voice despite doing daily work.

I have a great gender psychologist who I'm working on this with, but only seeing her every 6 weeks really isn't helping these acute periods of hopelessness that kill my focus at work because I'm so focused on my voice box.

&amp;#x200B;

My usual plan when I'm overwhelmed is to just take a few days and reset, but in this case I can't escape the negative feelings: either do nothing or keep trying and both just hurt. I also can't let this descend back into 5 years of chronic depression.

New-comer here.. Anyway, to the point; I’ve found a fabulous prosthetic website that has customisable packers that are extremely realistic. 

I WOULD LIKE TO DISCLAIM THAT THEY ARE UPWARDS OF €100! ‼️

Their website is reelmagik.com 
I don’t know if FtM prosthetics is all they do but what I’ve seen is truly impressive!

They go up to 9” and 7” and above is actually reduced and are all around €600 whereas the smaller ones rise in price when they do size.

There’s circumcised and uncircumcised.

They offer a wide range of skin colours going from very pale white to very dark brown, which I think is amazing!
Other packing brands often have 3 - 7 from which I’ve seen but this one offers 18 and they have some that are a bit more red or orange so you can almost definitely find your exact colour!

There’s also an addition called Flex Rod where you can make it hard for “play time” or more flaccid-looking for when you want to use it for packing or walking around.
You can choose Flaccid Fill, Firm Fill, Extra Firm Fill or even 2x Firm Fill instead though.

Along with all this (I know there’s a lot) there’s a little “pleasure pocket” that can take your bottom growth so that when you wear it you can get feeling, this is perfect for “play time” and will probably help with dysphoria a lot! (Option only available on 5” and up)

They also include hair that looks very realistic and comes in different hair colours. they use synthetic or human hair.

The standard warranty included is 6 months but you can extend it with extra pay. 
The standard warranty covers Tears, Air Bubbles, Seam Separation, Flex Rod and colouration issues but not General Wear &amp; Tear, Irreparable damage or “No questions asked replacements”, the one year addition covers all the same except also covers Daily Wear &amp; Pair and 2 year extension covers everything.

There’s adhesive and adhesive remover also available so you can wear it on day-to-day life like in the shower or just walking around. God, imagine being able to sleep naked finally without feeling dysphoria! (Also a cleaning spray available)

If you don’t want to stick it on, however, they can provide harnesses and underwear to suit that.

Anyway, that’s all I have to say ya’ll! I know this sounded like an advertisement but I just thought it was cool. I’m not endorsed by Reel Magik.
