Gender dysphoria of course. When I was an infant, toddler to Young boy I grew up with all females, mom, aunts, cousins, etc. And, I have what is called a buried penis. There are a couple of pics of my and a cousin standing in the shower at about three. No one is sure any more who is who. And both genital regions are clearly visible. Just for context. So, until about five or six I dressed and acted as a girl, thought I was a girl, never thought anything else. Then found it I was in fact, but I've with a buried penis. Buried in fact until I was 15 or so.

Jumping ahead, I've always had this doubt in my head about being male. It just doesn't seem right. I tried but I just don't like guy things. But I hid it from everyone because if the fear of going through all that again like the first time.

So now and since, I've always felt my stuff was more like a vagina that a penis. I've had vagina envy all my life. And I swear there is a cavity behind my scrotum when my real vagina is hidden. 

Over the years I've managed to maintain not a tuck, but an insert and squeeze together that keeps the entire thing vagina-esque. I call it my faux-vagina I want bottom surgery if nothing else, even if I always have to present as male. 

Sometimes I've even glued it together during sex to crush the hated dysphoria of my penis. It makes me feel as though I'm a female having sex and not trans. I've seriously considered getting a couple of hold installed on either side so I could ""fold"" it up for a more permanent presentation.  

Ok. So. Am I alone on this? Am I weird? If enough people responds and so I'll include a picture of it down there.

2020-03-02 04:05:32,fc6cmn,1,1,"Preface: I'm a transitioning mtf. The following is a true account of some of the earlier parts of my life. Please be kind in your comments if you wish to participate in a discussion.

As a kid I was abducted while on my way back home from doing the evening prayers at the neighborhood mosque near my home. It was brief and I managed to get him to return me back home but he had already molested me by then. My parents freaked. My cousins, who were my best friends and mosque buddies, also freaked. They started to give me porn. I don't know why they thought this was going to make things better somehow.

At the time we were just reeling back from 7 months of illegal invasion by foreign forces and a big environmental disaster left over by them.

Things were already very different from what they used to be just a few years before.

Before the war, my parents used to freely allow me to visit our beighbor's family and their boy who is 4 years my senior. We used to just hang out and do boy things like look at the tadpoles collection in their little pond or go hangout with the rest of the neighborhood kids. He used to have an RC car hobby. He would collect a bunch of models and tweak them, swap their bodies. I used to be so infatuated with him. I wanted to be like just him when I grew up.

We watched anime along with his two younger sisters when we got all tuckered out and needed to rest. It was a great time.

After the war broke-out and even after it ended, my father stopped letting me hang out with him. I think he just wanted to protect me.

It was weird with my father after the war and specially after he gave me his porn collection. The first time he showed it to me, he popped a tape into the VCR right in the living room with the rest of our family asleep in their rooms. We just started watching different scenes and switching to different tapes.

As I got older, we used to sit at the PC talking about day to day things while browsing porn like it's the most normal thing in the world.

Later on, I got accepted into an academic scholarship (mostly at the behests of my father) and made it to the States. After 3 years at school, I got to be roommates with an American girl just off campus who was an Alumna of the school and a teacher at a k-6 charter school.

I had been bouncing from place to place up until then. Most of my previous roommates were males and of my nationality. Everytime we got together to rent an apartment though, someone somehow got his ego all bruised and would leave or create a problem. I stayed with with them until there were just two of us left.

His name waa Issa. It's Arabic for Jesus. We had common classes at school so we did many of the homework together too. I used to solve the problems and then teach him how to do it. He used to scour the school for past tests. We had a mutual relationship going. It only lasted until our classes diverged though. He then invited his family over and asked me to leave.

I was very awkward with girls and women at that time of my life. My HS sweetheart and crush had just declined a gift I got her from a recent pilgrimage trip from Mecca I took during a summer trip.

So when it came time to be roommates with the Alumna just off-campus, I was uneasy to say the least. My religion forbade male/female relationships like this but I felt it was a last resort after the many failed attempts before it. I couldn't afford my own place and it was the cleanest of the places I had looked at too. I consulted with the friend who drove me to see the different places and he also thought hers was the best place from between the rest. He was also from my nationality but attended a different school in the area. He lended me the money for my down payment.

For the about a year or so, my relationship with the Alumna was purely platonic. We said hi and exchanged pleasantries every once in a while, I paid her the rent at the beginning of the month, and I used the kitchen but only when she wasn't using it. Other than that we both mostly stayed in our own rooms when we were home. We rarely used the dinning room table or watched TV in the living room.

One night though, I was completely surprised by a visitor. It was my father. He took a 20+ hour trip and came knocking on my door unannounced. I had taken-up smoking cigarettes at that time and I had gotten an ear piercing in my left lobe. I wasn't thinking about any of that when I opened the door though. When I looked through the peephole, it was as if my brain stopped telling me what to do and I opened the door as a reflex. It took me a second to make sure the man in front me was my father. After exchanging handshakes and hugs, he looked me in the eyes and ordered me to remove my piercing. I did without question. He then went into my room were he saw my cigarettes pack. He took one and asked for the lighter. We smoked together that night.

During the time he was there, he took me out to a dance club but we never ordered any drinks or danced. We never even played pool. We just stood there and watched until I asked if we could leave.

This wasn't the first time my father took me out to something like this either. Before the I met the Alumna, he took me on a road trip through a few friendly neighboring countries. In one of them, he took me out to a tavern. We just took a table and ordered food. My father ordered an arjeela/narjeela (sometimes known as sheesha or hookah here). We sat as the belly-dancers pranced in front of us. One of them even came up to me and ask me to (number her). I had no idea what that meant so I just said I don't have a number to give. After she left, I turned to my father and asked him the meaning of what she said. I had misheard and she was actually asking me to tip her.

On another trip, he took me to another tavern but this time were were accompanied by a female friend of his and her young daughter. Her daugher must have been 5 or 6 years younger than me. Her and I just chatted together and walked outside mostly while the adults stayed inside.

My father's relationship with my mom was on shakey grounds at the time so I never mentioned any of this to my mom until many years later. My mom did know about the porn to some extent earlier on though.

My father never seemed to do anything beside just sit, watch, and strike a conversation. He never molested me and I never saw him touch his female friend inappropriately either.

Back at the States at the Alumna's apartement, she had graciously allowed me to host my father for the duration of his stay specially considering the short notice. He used to take me shopping at the nearby supermarket then come back home and cook us a small meal. He would then ask me to ask the Alumna to come and join us for dinner. She would then join and we would have a pleasant conversation.

After my father left back home, I tried to turn my focus onto my studies. It was hard though. My social life was deteriorating, I was spending many sleepless nights and sometimes not sleep for 2 or 3 days at a time, I was running out of food and money, and my grade were slipping.

I sent a communication to my academic advisor at the embassy who used to oversee my scholarship asking her to withdraw myself from and return back home. I complied with all the steps but just before taking the final leap, I called my father to let him know I'm coming back home. He lost his sanity. He got mad angry, yelled at me, called the advisor, gave her a stern talking and then demanded that I stay and finish. So I took back my withdrawal request.

A bit after this, the Alumna and I became more friendly. We cooked dinner together and made brownies. We even started going to the movies and eating pizza at the local joint together. I made a move on her and told her my intentions of wanting to kiss her. She let me and we started making out. We moved into her bedroom. Eventually, I saw that she had a huge scar on her backside. It was about a 4x8 piece of her skin that was missing its upper layer. Naturally, I asked her what happened and she told me something that I did not know was possible to that extent at the time.

The Alumna was born with an intersex condition. The doctors didn't know her diagnosis at the beginning but after years of treatment and tests, she was diagnosed with AIS (androgen insensitivity syndrome). The doctors gave her parents the choice to either raise her as a girl or a boy and they chose to raise her as a girl. She had to go through several SRS procedures growing up and they used the skin graft from her back to form her vaginal canal.

I was shook to hear all of that. I had already known about intersex conditions at the time. I had read about it when I opened a biology book while at the school's bookstore. I just never imagined I would ever meet such a person.",trans,The alumna - a prologue to my life,1583147132.0,"{'created_utc': 1583121932, 'id': 'fc6cmn', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Preface: I'm a transitioning mtf.

He lended me the money for my down payment.\n\nFor the about a year or so, my relationship with the Alumna was purely platonic. We said hi and exchanged pleasantries every once in a while, I paid her the rent at the beginning of the month, and I used the kitchen but only when she wasn't using it. Other than that we both mostly stayed in our own rooms when we were home. We rarely used the dinning room table or watched TV in the living room.\n\nOne night though, I was completely surprised by a visitor. It was my father. He took a 20+ hour trip and came knocking on my door unannounced. I had taken-up smoking cigarettes at that time and I had gotten an ear piercing in my left lobe. I wasn't thinking about any of that when I opened the door though. When I looked through the peephole, it was as if my brain stopped telling me what to do and I opened the door as a reflex. It took me a second to make sure the man in front me was my father. After exchanging handshakes and hugs, he looked me in the eyes and ordered me to remove my piercing. I did without question. He then went into my room were he saw my cigarettes pack. He took one and asked for the lighter. We smoked together that night.\n\nDuring the time he was there, he took me out to a dance club but we never ordered any drinks or danced. We never even played pool. We just stood there and watched until I asked if we could leave.\n\nThis wasn't the first time my father took me out to something like this either. Before the I met the Alumna, he took me on a road trip through a few friendly neighboring countries. In one of them, he took me out to a tavern. We just took a table and ordered food. My father ordered an arjeela/narjeela (sometimes known as sheesha or hookah here). We sat as the belly-dancers pranced in front of us. One of them even came up to me and ask me to (number her). I had no idea what that meant so I just said I don't have a number to give. After she left, I turned to my father and asked him the meaning of what she said. I had misheard and she was actually asking me to tip her.\n\nOn another trip, he took me to another tavern but this time were were accompanied by a female friend of his and her young daughter. Her daugher must have been 5 or 6 years younger than me. Her and I just chatted together and walked outside mostly while the adults stayed inside.\n\nMy father's relationship with my mom was on shakey grounds at the time so I never mentioned any of this to my mom until many years later. My mom did know about the porn to some extent earlier on though.\n\nMy father never seemed to do anything beside just sit, watch, and strike a conversation. He never molested me and I never saw him touch his female friend inappropriately either.\n\nBack at the States at the Alumna's apartement, she had graciously allowed me to host my father for the duration of his stay specially considering the short notice. He used to take me shopping at the nearby supermarket then come back home and cook us a small meal. He would then ask me to ask the Alumna to come and join us for dinner. She would then join and we would have a pleasant conversation.\n\nAfter my father left back home, I tried to turn my focus onto my studies. It was hard though. My social life was deteriorating, I was spending many sleepless nights and sometimes not sleep for 2 or 3 days at a time, I was running out of food and money, and my grade were slipping.\n\nI sent a communication to my academic advisor at the embassy who used to oversee my scholarship asking her to withdraw myself from and return back home. I complied with all the steps but just before taking the final leap, I called my father to let him know I'm coming back home. He lost his sanity. He got mad angry, yelled at me, called the advisor, gave her a stern talking and then demanded that I stay and finish. So I took back my withdrawal request.\n\nA bit after this, the Alumna and I became more friendly. We cooked dinner together and made brownies. We even started going to the movies and eating pizza at the local joint together. I made a move on her and told her my intentions of wanting to kiss her. She let me and we started making out. We moved into her bedroom. Eventually, I saw that she had a huge scar on her backside. It was about a 4x8 piece of her skin that was missing its upper layer. Naturally, I asked her what happened and she told me something that I did not know was possible to that extent at the time.\n\nThe Alumna was born with an intersex condition. The doctors didn't know her diagnosis at the beginning but after years of treatment and tests, she was diagnosed with AIS (androgen insensitivity syndrome). The doctors gave her parents the choice to either raise her as a girl or a boy and they chose to raise her as a girl. She had to go through several SRS procedures growing up and they used the skin graft from her back to form her vaginal canal.\n\nI was shook to hear all of that. I had already known about intersex conditions at the time. I had read about it when I opened a biology book while at the school's bookstore. I just never imagined I would ever meet such a person."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'The alumna - a prologue to my life', 'created': 1583147132.0}"

2020-03-02 07:17:14,fc8fux,5,1,"Hello! I just want to share my experiences transitioning and growing up trans. Here’s a little back story.

Growing up being the only boy of 4 and having known I was trans since early childhood (around 10 ish) it was very tough at times. There was more frustration and resentment for being born male, days where I cried knowing I could never have a baby and having to come to grips with reality was difficult. My parents were very against anything LGBTQ so going to them for advice wasn’t an option, So I used sports as an outlet, thinking that by taking my feelings and using them to concentrate entirely on sports that it would somehow make me feel better about myself; it only was a way to run away and not face the truth about how I really felt about myself. 

People would constantly make fun of me for being not “man” enough, I’m not the tallest/biggest of person being 5’5 and only weighting 135 soaking wet. Called gay, flamboyant, and all sorts of things. I never felt comfortable in my own skin and it was a constant issue throughout my life.
Feeling this way made my romantic life utterly miserable, intimacy in relationships was very much not a point of interest with me. I dated lots of woman and they would find it odd, sometimes questioning me about it. 

After turning 29 I had finally gotten a stable career and was steadily improving my life when I met a friend named “Jane”. Jane was very kind and we instantly became friends when we met. One day we were chatting on messenger, we were telling each other our biggest secrets and when I had told her about mine she told me about the Seattle pride parade coming up and how I should go. After much consideration, decided to go and had THE most wonderful time. While there I met some of her friends who had started HRT for ftm and they educated me on routes I could go if I wanted to start it. After thinking about it, I made quite possibly the greatest decision ever for myself by going to start HRT and begin my journey towards a better version of me. 

Once everyone knew it was kind of make or break. I hoped they still would love me the same was my main concern. Mother and older sister don’t talk to me but was lucky enough that two sisters were understanding. Dad was okay with it after a long conversation. 

Now 7+ months on HRT, and a name change, the changes I’ve noticed how people and the world are. I’ve become more afraid of being alone at times especially walking at night, my coworkers who are male like to sometimes take the work I’m already doing and do the rest for me, which is still weird to get used to. Guys do a lot of staring. People seem kinder and are more willing to help. The most important thing to me is that I can be free to be myself and honestly I’m even amazed to be at this point because I don’t know how I summed up the strength to finally transition. 

So my loves, shoot for the stars.

2020-03-02 16:25:45,fcejer,8,1,"Hi, everyone 😊 

I have a favour to ask of my trans friends out there: I'm an author, and one of my main characters in a new novel is a trans-woman called Jay, 20. My story isn't *about* her trans-ness (not my story to tell), but it does come into play at certain points, as it is a part of her character. 

Would anyone mind giving me some sensitivity/accuracy feedback on the following six moments?

**1) The moment she comes out to the reader. (Jay's point-of-view.)**  
With my hand on the front door handle, I paused, my eyes trained on the mantelpiece to my side. My smile faded. The photograph was back. I kept hiding it in drawers so I didn’t have to see it every day, but mum would always bring it out again.  
It was a photo of a younger her and a little boy, sat on a park bench eating ice cream. I turned the picture around and exited to the porch, determined to put it to the back of my mind. Nothing would ruin my good mood today. Not even an old photo of an old me.  
I could just destroy it, I was sure mum didn’t keep a spare. The only reason I didn’t was that it brought her so much joy to see. Me, on the other hand? That version of me was lost in the past, and I had no intention of giving it a map to my present. I was a woman, and that’s all that mattered. I breathed in a fresh breath of morning air and continued to the station.

**2) A moment a close friend (and love interest) asks how Jay's reassignment appointments are going. (Jay's POV. For context, her mother is terminally ill.)**  
We left the coffee shop and walked side-by-side across the street to the glittering glass doors of the main office block.  
“So, how’s your mum doing?” he asked as we reached the other side.   
I shrugged, trying to seem indifferent, but my chest tightened at the question.  
“Same as usual. The doctors are still insistent that there’s no cure… just give her medication to keep her comfortable. She’s getting by, though. Her paintings give her something else to focus on.”  
Aiden nodded slowly. “And… what about you? Any news from the hospital on those appointments?”  
I grimaced and sighed. “Honestly I’ve been putting the consultations on the back burner while mum has her treatment… It’s only aesthetic, you know?” I faltered, trying to hide the developing strain in my voice. “Hardly seems so important…” I shook my head. “I just don’t know how much longer she’ll be able to hold on.”  
“Hey…” Aiden paused just in front of the doors, forcing me to stop with him. He took me by both shoulders and turned me to face him, smiling gently. “Don’t think like that. Your mum is strong. She’s made it this far. You can't forget about yourself in all this.”  
My chin lowered to my chest. What had I done to deserve a friend like this? But that’s all he was… a friend. And that stung in all sorts of ways.

**2) A moment a known bully targets Jay. (Jay's POV. The bully calls Jay 'Pixie' because of her surname 'Pixel' and her petite, androgynous look. Her ""keeper"" is referring to her close friend, Aiden, who recently went missing.)**  
“Where’s your keeper, Pixie?”   
I stiffened in my seat; I had no idea she had been sitting in front of me.   
“Haven’t seen him around today. Did he finally get sick of you?” Beast continued.   
I kept my eyes pinned to the smooth concrete of the footpath speeding past us, my hand gripping my seatbelt. Her reflection moved on the shuttle window. She held a compact mirror in her hand and was adding an extra layer of powder to her face.  
“It’ll take a lot more than that to cover your imperfections,” I said.  
I looked away and heard the compact click shut. I knew what was coming. Why couldn’t I have just kept my mouth shut?!  
“At least I have a fighting chance, sweetie. I don’t go around putting on an act, claiming to be something I’m not. Some of us are born this way. I don’t even know how he stood you for so long, really. Probably felt sorry for your incessant pity party.”   
My face heated up. We weren’t the only two people on the bus, but it sure felt like it. But did anybody else stick up for me? Did anybody else even spare an apologising glance in my direction? No. My eyes prickled with held back tears. In that moment, surrounded by colleagues that I barely knew, I felt more alone than I had in years.  
The shuttle drew to a slow halt, and the side door slid open. I waited for the people in front of me to get off before I grabbed my bag and followed them. Why Robert had made me take the staff shuttle when there was so much free space in his limousine, I’ll never know. *Oh, wait.* Yes, of course I knew. He was a selfish prick, just like everybody else in this damn company.  
I paused just outside the shuttle to look up at the warehouse before us. I’d visited a few times before with Robert, but today it had been officially repurposed. I wasn’t nearly as excited as everybody else was to see the inside, though.   
A hard shove made me stumble forward, painfully hitting the ground on all fours. I spun onto my behind and glared up at Beast.  
“What is your problem, Victoria!?”  
“*You* are my problem, Jay. When are you going to toughen up? Or better yet, when are you going to learn to see when you’re not wanted?”  
I pushed myself off the pavement so we were at the same level, but her eyes still stood half a metre above mine.   
“Look around you,” she whispered, “There’s nothing for you here. Do you see any of these people looking out for you?”  
I looked around at the colleagues surrounding us, all heading into the building. If any of them had been watching the scene before, none of them were now.   
Beast hummed. “Didn’t think so. I’d take a long think about whether you belong here, Pixie, because to me, it doesn’t look like you have a reason to stick around.”

**3) A moment of insult from a 'supposed' ally, who is also her boss. (Jay's POV.)**  
“So! Onward and upward, eh?” he laughed, but his pun fell flat. Could the man not see the corpse on the floor just metres from us? I stared at him, wide-eyed.  
He looked back at me, and shook his head. “You will always encounter people who protest your success, Jay. We take no notice of them.”  
I didn’t answer. I mean, how could I? If my ears were working correctly, he was condoning murder.  
Clearly not getting the response he expected, Robert cleared his throat. “So, I want you to go with the next capture team. You could do with some experience around those men, you might learn something.” I almost dropped my pen, but he continued, “And I want a report on my desk by tomorrow afternoon. I need to know their efficiency; what went wrong, what went right.”  
As much as I would like to have said that my biggest concern was having a full-length report completed in less than twenty-four hours, I was a little more concerned about where that report would take me.  
**4) A moment of sexual intimidation (TW). (Jay's POV. I use the insult 'weirdo' as I don't want to include anything too vulgar or triggering. If you have any 'better' suggestions, let me know!)**  
The way Scarface looked at me instantly told me he had called my bluff. I swallowed.  
“That so?” he stepped away slightly so I could see the other hunters stood watching us. He grabbed something from one of his cronies and shoved it in front of my face. “We know it wasn’t a cat yesterday.”  
“A… what?”  
“A trap was triggered yesterday in Corby. You checked it out. You told us it was a cat.” Scarface moved in closer with every word until his face was almost touching mine, “So why did we find this in the net?”  
I looked down past our noses to see what he had pulled out of the brown mess in his hands. Between his fingers, he held a tiny, black feather. I looked up again, trying to conceal my growing terror, but he was so close I was sure he could hear my pounding heartbeat.  
I coughed. “Looks like… a-a bird feather.”  
The man’s eyes flicked down to my neck, peering under the collar of my shirt at the crusting cuts. I felt the light touch of his fingertips snaking past my waist, towards my behind. His thumb latched into my waistband, and he tugged me closer until his chest was pressed against mine. I whimpered as he dropped his chin to my ear. His hot breath coursed across me, making my skin writhe.  
“Last night, one of my men reported a weirdo taking off with two of those things during a raid. A friend of yours?”  
I tensed my jaw, preparing to take a swing at him but not sure that I could fight the paralysis. I regretted leaving my penknife in my bag. But then Scarface took his hands off me and backed away again, folding his arms and daring me to make the next move. He knew he had me.  
I shivered. Either the warehouse had plummeted in temperature, or the adrenaline coursing through my body was preparing me to run. The cages surrounding me felt inviting, so long as they put a barrier in-between me and these thugs. I clenched my fists to stop the tremors.  
“I-I just remembered I have an errand to run.”  
Throwing my clipboard into Scarface’s chest, I ducked as I darted around the corner towards the exit.  The yells of the hunters followed me, but I dared not look back.

**5) A moment of insult. (Primary MC's POV, not Jay.)**  
The streets in the distance were filled with headlights coming in our direction. The roars of engines getting louder every second. If we fled on foot, we would easily be caught. That left only one other option: up.  
A crackling response came from the hunter’s radio and he replied quickly, “No, I’m outnumbered.” Another crackle. “Looks like two shadow walkers and a… a…”  
Jay turned around for a moment and frowned at the hunter in a way that I could only describe as offended. He glared back at her while the radio crackled again.  
“I don’t know, some weirdo! … Yes, a human!”  
Jay’s jaw dropped into a furious scowl, and I pushed the window open so cold night air filled the room.  
“Are you afraid of heights?” I asked, bringing Jay’s attention to me.  
Her eyes remained wide but eyebrows contorted. I pulled off my coat and tied it securely around my waist, then offered my hand to the gawking human who all-too-slowly pieced together the plan that had quickly formed in my mind.

**6) The moment Jay comes out to the Primary MC. (Primary MC's POV - note, the Primary MC is** ***not human*****)**  
“I could get used to this weather,” Jay said, eyes closed and face turned up to the sky. Her nose and cheeks were already beginning to show the first signs of sunburn.  
""Yeah, well, don't,"" I smirked. ""As soon as this mess is over, I'm taking you home.""  
She pouted. “Do you have to?”  
“Don’t you have family back in Galia?” I asked.  
""Not really. It's just been mum and me for a while now...""  
“Well, that’s still somebody to go back for.”  
I smiled, but Jay avoided my eyes and looked at the floor. She didn’t exactly look reluctant to go back, but there was a sadness behind her gaze that told another story.  
“No friends, then?” I said. I hadn’t meant for it to come across as blunt, more empathetic. The only friend I could really account for was… well…  
Jay shrugged and leaned back on the wall to look into the crowds in front of us. ""Making friends can be a little difficult for people like me.""  
I tilted my head and looked across at her. “What’s that supposed to mean?”  
For a moment, Jay looked confused. She looked down at herself, then back at me. “Are you kidding? Look at me.”  
I did. “What am I looking for, exactly?”  
Jay pursed her lips, eyes locked with mine in a thoroughly confused battle. She sighed, and muttered under her breath, almost against her own will, “I’m… trans, Bren.” She continued at my expression, “When I was born… I was Jacob, a boy. Well, I guess you could say I’ve always been a girl, but on the outside, I…” she stuttered to a halt.  
I looked Jay up and down again, “So you’re saying people don’t like you just because you changed the way you look to suit how you feel?”  
Jay’s eyebrows raised. “Er… yeah, when you put it like that. Pretty much.”  
I laughed and shook my head, turning my face up to the sun, “You humans are ridiculous. You somehow have the ability to create a problem out of everything. You know what I see?” I suddenly opened my eyes and turned to face her again. “You know what I see when I look at you? When I look at all humans?”  
Jay shook her head, lips pressed together.  
I sighed. “I see eyes, I see ears, I see fingers, arms and legs. I see life, and then I see a hell of a lot of work to do,” I ended with a smirk.

""Making friends can be a little difficult for people like me.""  \nI tilted my head and looked across at her. “What’s that supposed to mean?”  \nFor a moment, Jay looked confused. She looked down at herself, then back at me. “Are you kidding? Look at me.”  \nI did. “What am I looking for, exactly?”  \nJay pursed her lips, eyes locked with mine in a thoroughly confused battle. She sighed, and muttered under her breath, almost against her own will, “I’m… trans, Bren.” She continued at my expression, “When I was born… I was Jacob, a boy. Well, I guess you could say I’ve always been a girl, but on the outside, I…” she stuttered to a halt.  \nI looked Jay up and down again, “So you’re saying people don’t like you just because you changed the way you look to suit how you feel?”  \nJay’s eyebrows raised. “Er… yeah, when you put it like that. Pretty much.”  \nI laughed and shook my head, turning my face up to the sun, “You humans are ridiculous. You somehow have the ability to create a problem out of everything. You know what I see?” I suddenly opened my eyes and turned to face her again. “You know what I see when I look at you? When I look at all humans?”  \nJay shook her head, lips pressed together.  \nI sighed. “I see eyes, I see ears, I see fingers, arms and legs. I see life, and then I see a hell of a lot of work to do,” I ended with a smirk.\n\n**Thank you, all!

2020-03-02 20:43:51,fcimot,3,1,"Hello, so I am cis, and my partner recently came out as nonbinary, and I am having a really hard time understanding it, and coming to terms with it, and I would like some help. I have aspergers and OCD, and this is absolutely not an excuse for shitty behavior, but I have spent my whole life breaking everything down into categories, and numbers. I love statistics, order and anything of that nature. Effectively I am comforted by consistency and transparency. So, admittedly one of my biggest issues is understanding/ being comfortable with trans people. Less so MtF, or FtM, but rather people who don’t fit into a clear category, or shift between them. I know this isn’t a good mindset to have, and I feel bad for having it, and I will continue to try to become more “woke” about it, but I have spent years trying to and progress has been minimal, and I am deeply sorry about this, for their sake, and for the sake of any trans person. 

When they came out to me I was completely supportive, not in actuality, but I presented myself as such. I have always been a bit gender nonconforming, so I tried to view it from that perspective, and it seemed to be fine. However over the last few months they have started to float, and enact more and more “extreme” changes. They changed their name and started hormones, and have also gotten really involved with the local trans community. And now most drastically getting a double mastectomy, or “at the very least” getting extreme breast reduction surgery. Here I accept responsibility, as I did not react well to this, but it is such a drastic and permanent change, that for whatever reason just makes me skin crawl when I think about it. I feel like an asshole for that, and a few of my friends said that I am one for caring that much about breasts, which I guess is fair. So we tried to move past this, but it just hasn’t been successful.

I ended up confiding that I love my partner, because I really really do, and I will respect all their choices expect for that one, but I also deep down will always see them as their previous self, and on a personal level I do not genuinely believe they are nonbinary, and that I will be faking acceptance because despite this massive thing about them I don’t like, there is far more about them I do like. They, understandably, were furious and said that if I can’t love them for who they are then we shouldn't be together,and that they want stuff to be authentic. Further more, they said they would not even feel comfortable being my friend if I don't feel authentically, which is my absolute nightmare.

I understand and respect their position, but at the same time, I don’t care about authenticity, I never have, it is a concept that just makes no moral sense to me. To me, as long as we are both benefiting, I don’t care about intentions.

So here is where I feel stuck. I do legitimately have a hard time accepting their condition as real and medical, but that is unfair and I am working out it, so I will treat it as such here. They can’t help their gender, and I cannot help how I feel, but both of us would be miserable separated because we have been such a good combo. I am willing to suppress how I feel because they matter more to me than some discomfort. However I am asking for them to set aside their desire for authenticity to have the same respect for the fact that I really am struggling, and trying, to adapt to this. I feel it is better that we both get most of what we want, than us both being miserable, or one of us getting something that the other’s expense. I also said that their body is their choice, but I also really would like if we could find a middle ground in regards to the breasts, or at least hold off till such a drastic choice is made.  
They said they would think about this, but have ghosted me since. I just really want this to work, because I cannot picture my life without them, and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice is needed to make it work because I love them so much. However I need time to try to adjust to this, and it is all just happening so fast and I don’t want it to be over. We were both happy when I was faking it and I just want to go back to that with maybe a bit of middle ground when it comes to breasts.  


Also I am really sorry if anything in here was offensive or I misused words or anything. I really really don't mean this community harm. 

TLDR: My partner came out as nonbinary and is going on hormones and also wants to get surgery.

Sometimes I'm oblivious to it, sometimes it hits ***HARD.***  


I love some aspects of being a girl and hate others. I really like my hips and I love my hair (which is medium-length and I'm planning on keeping regardless), I am also pretty feminine personality-wise (I am very warm, loving and ''sweet'', my personality is mostly female coded) and I wouldn't change. I'm really sensitive to people, nature and art.  (I know, these don't define gender, but are better-seen through a female).  But I hate my breasts, weakness and being seen as a female. I despise female attire most of the time (I find it absolutely gorgeous, but whenever I wear it it just feels wrong and weird and like I have to hide it or I'm doing something wrong), but crossdressing is frowned upon and I am usually seen as ''weird'' by most people I know. I would love a flat chest, muscles and a light beard, but I don't think I'd love it enough to go through all the trouble of transitioning.   


My language is one of the romance languages, which means every. bloody. adjective. is. gendered. I'm nervous? I'm *feminine* nervous. I'm excited? I'm *girl* excited. And it feels weird. It feels wrong, but I like being a girl regardless.   


I like my name, but it's female so I don't like being referred to by it. However, I feel *especially* uncomfortable being called male pronoums - it feels fake and like cheating or that I'm illuding myself. Whenever I think I might be trans it feels weird and like I'm faking it, but being cis   


Genitalia? I'm asexual. As indifferent to it as it gets. No dysphoria or euphoria there.

I would love a flat chest, muscles and a light beard, but I don't think I'd love it enough to go through all the trouble of transitioning.   \n\n\nMy language is one of the romance languages, which means every. bloody. adjective. is. gendered. I'm nervous? I'm *feminine* nervous. I'm excited? I'm *girl* excited. And it feels weird. It feels wrong, but I like being a girl regardless.   \n\n\nI like my name, but it's female so I don't like being referred to by it. However, I feel *especially* uncomfortable being called male pronoums - it feels fake and like cheating or that I'm illuding myself. Whenever I think I might be trans it feels weird and like I'm faking it, but being cis   \n\n\nGenitalia? I'm asexual. As indifferent to it as it gets. No dysphoria or euphoria there.   \n\n\nI don't want you to tell me ''you're definitely a boy!'' or ''definitely a girl!''. I just gave you some pointers so you can help me figure it out.

2020-03-03 09:09:03,fcrzri,3,1,"CW: suicide, emotional abuse (I couldn't find a better way of warning people)

So I have already vented a lot of this to my best friend, but I dont want to burn him out to much on my complaining.

So apparently I'm just selfish and rude and an asshole for not wanting to be around or talk with people who put literally no effort into gendering me correctly or using my name. (Even though I have explained that it almost feels like get slapped acrossed the face). I have explained that misgendering me is emotional abuse and my mother scoffs at it saying ""everyone has issues, I cry myself to sleep every night because I've lost my son.""

She wants me to greave with her for her lost son and get upset that I don't have any emotions to this person she is claiming to have died.

I always had shitty behavior and I still have some shitty behavior, but whole family is all hypersensitive to any little thing right now and they make me feel like shit. Like my grandparents (current landlord) felt scared to talk with about the fact the power got bumped up by quite a lot of money (I have no issues paying the amount I caused to increase), so my mother has to be the one to tell me. Or people saying I cant get angry at them because ""it's new"", ""we've never dealt with this"", or ""we need time"". I don't care if you slip up, I just want to hear it once and you're not. No one is and it hurts to constantly feel hurt and alone.

I'm trying to set boundaries between me and my mother because we had a very unhealthy codependency caused by two very abusive marriages. Even my therapist agrees that I should be putting up those boundaries to get to a more normal relationship. But no, I'm an asshole for listening to the ""Crazy Lady"" (mother's pet name for my therapist)

I still haven't gotten over the fact she threaten to kill herself if I transition (it was very clear that was just emotional abusing me even when she did it) she just wishes things could go back to how things were. That wonderful time I had to constantly fight the urge to kill myself.

She thinks I'm selfish because I don't give away my possession to more needy people, because it has to hurt to count.

On top of all of this shit I have to deal with my dysphoria getting worse (areas that already caused dysphoria before are causing more because they feel wrong), social phobia that makes it hard to present how I want because I feel alone and scared, perfectionism that leads to avoidance causing distress because I'm scared to try to present correctly and fail, internalize transphobia that I only give to myself that make me feel like a freak. (I dont view other trans people as freaks, just me), and on top of that I still have daddy issues from my father disowning me over a $70 highschool class ring that I didn't ask a cent from him for and only showed him a 3d model (it terrifies me to think I might push my best friends away because I did something wrong and that is directly cause by being disowned)

2020-03-04 06:34:51,fd90ix,4,1,"Okay, so obviously I'm cis. I'm kind of an attempt of a writer. Never finished a book, I've only finished writing short of stories of one or two pages.
Thing is, there's this show that I love, and I'm thinking about writing a fanfic about it. I want to write a trans girl who gets the chance to get one wish granted, so she asks to transition. Now, I didn't want her words to be something like ""I want to be a normal girl"" or anything like that because she's already a girl. So I'm wondering, would ""I want a body that makes me feel safe/good"" be a better wording?
Aside from that, I have a few more questions. Can a trans girl identify with they/them pronouns? I mean, her/their gender is still binary, so I don't know if that's possible.
Also, if someone identify with they/them pronouns, would you refer to them as ""this perdón"" or ""these person""? That may be a stupid question, but English isn't my native language, so I wanted to ask just in case.

Got up super early to shave and put my makeup on, all in time so my wife and I could catch the train into town. We got to the clinic in plenty of time and ended up waiting till nearly half an hour past my appointment time before being called I was SUPER nervous because all I could think of was, ""What if they say I'm too old?"" or ""What happens if they don't believe I'm transgender?"", you know stupid stuff like that. As it was my first appointment, the doctor's trainee (that's what it said on her badge ""trainee"") asked me all sorts of questions about how I realised I was trans, how I far have I gone in my transition and how my mental state has been since coming out. I answered everything truthfully, with my wife helping to fill in the gaps where I might have forgotten things. 

After taking all the answers down, she went to find the doctor I was supposed to see to confer and see what she wanted to do. She said that they would either start me on medication straight away or they might send me to see a psychologist to make sure that I am doing the right thing. After she left, my anxiety went through the roof and I started asking myself all those stupid questions again. We waited a while, the doctor was with another patient, but she finally came back with my doctor in tow. She said all my blood tests seemed fine, I was knowledgeable about what medications there are and what results I can expect etc, and that she was happy for me to start HRT. YAY! She said they were giving me a prescription for Spirolactolone (25mg) and a referral for a blood test in a months time where if my liver and kidneys are fine with the Spiro, I can start taking 100mg of Spiro. She then said that in 3 months time I'll have another appointment and that's when, depending on the rest of the blood test results, we'll talk about starting estrogen.

After all my worries that I've had since coming out, what with my age and all my stupid insecurties, today has been so awesome! The only real downer was when I gave the receptionist the form saying I need another appointment in 3 months and she said her next available one isn't until September. My state and my country (Australia) has no funding for transgender services, and it sucks. All I can do is hope they can find a time to fit me in or someone cancels.

2020-03-05 09:16:12,fdspr7,3,1,"My 24 year old sibling who was born a female told us he was a male in a female’s body, he’d always been more masculine than feminine anyway and when he was living as a female, he had been a lesbian for around 5 years, about a month ago, I was the first family member that he told he was trans, I wasn’t shocked at all. 
l’m buzzing for him, genuinely over the moon that he’s finally living as his true self without worrying about what others think. 

I’m 19 years old so I’m naturally more accepting than the rest of my family because of things like internet culture just normalising someone coming out in one way or another, actually, he announced that he was a male through a post on Facebook because it was easier than having to tell people face to face, which is sad, but younger generations are far more accepting than older people.

Our grandparents on both sides won’t even make the effort to call him by the correct pronouns, they still refer to him as her/she, darling, pet, love, etc. I know he understands it’ll take time for them to adapt, but it annoys me that they can’t just stop spitting their dummies out and accept that he’s now a male!

I’m just asking for any advice on how to adapt and have his male pronouns come naturally in a conversation, I find myself constantly going “she- oops! He, Sorry!” , I know he doesn’t mind because I correct myself, he still accidentally uses female pronouns for himself all the time as well, but our family members (besides our parents) aren’t even making an effort, they use female pronouns and don’t even realise they’re misgendering him. 
I spoke to him about it and he suggested that I use male pronouns when I talk to people about him so it sticks in their heads that’s he’s serious about being a man, because I feel like they’re not making an effort as “it’s just a phase” and “it’s not possible to be 24 and only just realise you’re a male”. They’re ignorant, and it’s really sad for me to see it because he’s one of the people I’m closest to.

Anyway — Has anyone got any advice on how to have the male pronouns come naturally rather than having to correct myself? I know he doesn’t mind, but I still feel bad for doing it. It’s not easy to remember to use the male pronouns in a regular flowing conversation, if you get what I mean?

2020-03-05 16:31:16,fdxsfq,3,1,"Hey guys. I got a problem right now and don't know that to do, so thought that some of you maybe hat the same issues before.

I'm born female but I kinda feel more like a guy. It started some Years ago, when I hit puberty. Since then I had tons of problems with my sexuality and Gender. When I was younger, I didn't like the idea of a hetero relationship for myself. So I had a girlfriend and was a little tomboy it felt great to act more like a guy, but I didn't thought much about it at this time. But didn't work out and we broke up. Some time later, a friend send me a fanfiction about a guy falling in love with another guy. I've never really thought about it before at this point, but I instantly got into it and loved that gay stuff. First I thought, I just liked the idea, but I'm still a normal girl. But the more time passed, the more I felt like something was wrong with me. Typical girl things felt wrong, I started to hate my body and started to question my gender. This was years ago and I still have no idea, if I want to be a guy or girl. It kinda feels right to identify as a guy and I'm so f***ing yealous about trans guys and gay guys, because they have something I can't have. So there is defenetly something ""wrong"". But on the other hand, I'm afraid as hell to tell others, because I'm not sure if I would regret it somehow later. And my family and school is absolutely not supportive about something like this. So I have no idea what I should do. 
Did some of you experienced something like that too? Was It easy for you to accept that you're Trans or did it took you ages like me? I'm really confused about this stuff and it really takes me down some times. so I hope, someone has similar experiences and could give me some advice.

I've noticed a lot of queer women in children's media lately. Not that many queer male characters (especially in mainstream works), and almost no trans characters.

Ones I know of:

- Blaze from Jem and the Holograms (family friendly, though not specifically kid aimed, comic)
- Jo from Lumberjanes (comic)
- Sebastian from The Prince and the Dressmaker (comic)
- Birdo &amp; Vivian from Mario (game)
- Zonda from Azure Striker Gunvolt (game)
- BMO from Adventure Time (cartoon)
- Rachel from Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling (animated film)
- All the Gems (minus Steven) and Shep from Steven Universe (cartoon)
- Alluka from HunterxHunter (anime+manga)
- Seiko from Lovely Complex (anime+manga)
- Tiger and Magne from My Hero Academia (anime+manga)
- Kaoru from Tamako Market (anime; I'm not sure if it's specifically shoujo or shounen, but it's kid friendly)
- Nitori, Mako, Takatsuki, Yuki, and Ebina from Wandering Son (manga+anime; it's actually aimed at men but predominantly reads like a middle grade work and the English release is aimed at teens)
- Gracefully Grayson (book)
- Grady from Parrotfish (book)
- George (book)
- The Other Boy (book)
- The Pants Project (book)
- Alanna from Song of the Lioness (book; she's written as cis but the writer has said, in hindsight, she's genderfluid)
- Tommy from Seawalkers (book)
- Alex from Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard (book)
- Sara and a few other characters from The Princess (webcomic)

How would you write trans characters in trans media? How do you imply or reveal they're trans?

When it comes to writing them... I find the lengthy coming out scene to be overdone. It can be used well, but I'd prefer it to not to be.

2020-03-07 05:26:02,feqpz6,0,1,"This is my 24 hour update of being on HRT as a non-binary person. 


• After only 24 hours on HRT although absolutely zero physical effects have taken place I have noticed emotional changes. 


• I have an urge to hug/hold things close to my chest


• and while playing OverWatch I got play of the game as my main, McCree, and called his highlight intro ""aggressive"" and instantly changed it. (mcrees coffin highlight intro) 


since this is my first update I should give a bit of information on myself so you guys get a better idea of who I am and why I'm on HRT. 

Hi, my name is Willow, I am 20 years old. I'm fully out with all of my friends but not with all of my family. I am queer and I am non-binary, AMAB. Before starting HRT I was already quite feminine in appearance. I have a four-year-old pupper and she's the cutest thing in the world, oh, and I started HRT 24 hours ago. 


The reason I started HRT is because I want a softer and less masculine physique and face, actually starting on HRT was surprisingly quick (not much therapy/counseling was needed as I already present and act androgynous or feminine most of the time, but also make the process quicker is that I had spent the last four months doing heavy research on this and so I had an educated answer for (almost) every question they asked) as the country I'm in is incredibly progressive on this. I seriously couldn't be happier with the amount of respect that I was given when I went in for the process of starting HRT. 

My occupation is quite physically demanding however thankfully this hasn't developed very masculine muscles. And if you can't tell by now I'm quite a feminine non binary hooman. 


I've been on Reddit for many many many years however this is an ALT account (even if the name says it's a throwaway, 11000 Karma doesn't think so)

Transition became trauma.
Deep and tangible.

I lost my marriage for daring to even ask if he'd love me as a boy.
I lost an ex, when I asked the same.

 I hurt and broke and strained a relationship I thought would last forever, but as it turns out internalized transphobia is a thing.

Upset, angry fear as I worked myself out.
Telling me that they ""Don't like fat men"" when as a woman they praised my squish.

I didnt even make it to hormones before I completely broke down, ""I'm non-binary. I was confused, I'm not a boy"".***

2020-03-08 04:50:11,ff7p8d,0,1,"I usually bind for day to day life, however I have joined a gym recently, and I needed a safer alternative to binding while exercising. I decided to try TransTape. I'd heard about it online a bit, and I have a friend who uses it. I read the instructions as best as I could, and I looked up a few videos. It didn't bind particularly well, but it relieved me a little, so I kept it on for the day. It wasn't particularly comfortable, and I wanted to try retaping it tomorrow for better binding results... so I took it all off. I know oil is generally recommended, but I didn't have any on hand, and the instructions say hot water is a fine alternative so long as you take your time with it. Suffice to say, it was excruciatingly painful, and has left my skin extremely sensitive. Well, the adhesive from the tape is left on my skin. I had a towel wrapped around me, and I had to physically peel it off.

Concerning transition, I really wanted to present male as first--I cut my hair, binded (incorrectly), and changed out my wardrobe. I wanted to start T as soon as possiblea and get both top and bottom surgery.

My hair is currently below my shoulders for comfortability--as I have sensory issues w/ it touching my face/neck. The main reason why I don't bind anymore is bc I used 2 sports bras or many layers of camisoles, which pushed my chest into my abdomen. It made me even more dysphoric bc I could feel my chest pressed against me.

Aside from everything, I'm really scared of medical transition now. I don't want botom surgery, but I would like to have a flat chest. Honest to god, I'm scared of surgical complications, infections, and just not having someone to care for me after the surgery.

Hi there,

We are a few young students come from China living overseas, looking for help here for poor transgender girls in China, who are now in critical condition. I’m writing all the things below to explain this astonishing but true reality, to find some people who are willing to help and do something for them.

As we all have known that the social systems of China under the communist rule, which seems to be pretty, can be a poison for transgender girls. They are being regarded as an “unnormal”, that is, not recognized even by their family members. Since their childhood, they had long suffered domestic violence. To have a son who has founded her real sexual identity as a girl, is a curse to many Chinese families: both mentally and socially. There, people are fanatic with a socially recognized success; the only end for those who are different, is to die in silence. 

Parents beat their children as they tell them their sexual conversion; sometimes their only way out is to leave their homes, and wander at the bottom of the urban society in China, take temporary jobs, and, at the same time, being discriminated. They cannot receive proper medical care due to their critical conditions in poverty. Getting medicines like Cyproterone acetate for those girls is super difficult; among expensive medicines, there are also a lot of fake medicines mixed with the true ones. 

At the same time, it’s also a luxury for some of the transgender girls to receive acceptable surgeries. The premise of operating an orchiectomy is a certificate of diagnosis issued by a registered medical doctor, which costs at least 3,000 CNY (More than 400 dollars), and the surgery itself costs even more.

A transgender girl that I know, had done the orchiectomy before BY HERSELF. She got wounded then and have been sent to a hospital by her friend, for she had left her family very early – her parents can simply not accept that they have a transgender son. Lacking the money of doing such a cleanup surgery, she is now waiting desperately on a bed in the hospital, suffering tremendous pain, cannot even get out of bed. The cost of the surgery is about 10,000 CNY (about 1,500 dollars). Now we have already paid a part of the fees for her, but our financial situation is also strained, because we have too few incomings. 

In society, they are also a group of “strangers”: This society does not accept and admit the existence of people who are different from them. The differences have become excuses for humiliating and plundering. I have a good friend whose girlfriend is such a transgender girl in Sichuan, China. She was once working as a temporary worker at a gas station without a labor contract. The keeper of the gas station refused to pay the wage at the end of the month. He found a fire hydrant and shot the high-pressure water onto this transgender girl, for she was “a monster”.  She got wounded, fled away, and did not have money to go to the hospital. 

Without a family, without social care, but only with the constant hostility from everyone else. The only consolation for them is the love among each other. Instead of their original families, some other transgender friends, who have unconditional sympathy with those who have suffered enormous pain, humiliation, and brutality, have been their new family members. But the ruthless Chinese society is a desert for them; friends come together, provide some anonymous help to each other, and then scatter again. Due to their fragile social condition, their merciful hearts also seem to be tiny in front of the fearsome state apparatus and this society, which has put unto them unimaginable oppression.

There are already some mutual-helping groups in China founded by some transgender girls who are with better living conditions in cities, but they use to only give some instructions to each other, it seems more likely to be some clubs. However, for those transgender girls who are at the bottom of the society, their voices are fewer to be heard; their tears fall into the soil, and their despair has long swallowed them into the darkness. Lack of medicine, lack of money for surgery, lack of confidence of mutual-helping, lack of courage of asking for help, and lack of the bridge between themselves and those foreigners who can provide help. They are kind and merciful, are super grateful only for a few bits of help; they are also willing to recompense the help in any way they could. 

We are two Christians, have already had the experience of helping more than 10 transgender girls in China, most of them were in extremely critical condition and totally helpless. Those helps are done directly in person during the past one and a half years. But now we have faced two serious problems:

1. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus in China, many transgender girls now have no channel to buy Cyproterone acetate. They must suspend their usage of medicines now. The consequences are very serious. **Temporarily, we have no channel to get Cyproterone acetate legally or illegally. We need the help of western transgender organizations, or people who can get those medicines, and we hope to establish a stable medicine trade route which could provide low-price medicines for those people who need help**; the earnings of this trade route can be contributed into the fund so that we can provide more practical help.

**2.** We have financial problems and have no link with any people who are willing to provide help for those girls. We are students, financially dependent on our parents, and they do not know what we are doing. Also, the transferring of money is also a problem for us – **we need bank accounts of some western people to avoid the fund monitoring of the communist party.** We will often post some trustable people who are crying for help on our account, and we need a new route to send the aid safely into the hands of those needy.

We are going to do something for them to change this situation: an initiative of a new homeland for transgender girls. Due to the restriction of our own, the direct help does not work for long; we are rather going to establish an international group in which people in the west can also join and be a part of us. 

We have many experiences to share, but we do not have a detailed route map. We are going to create that together with you and we are willing to be a bridge between you and those needy. **If you can help us with any of the two problems I’ve mentioned above, or you have anything else to help with, contact me (Private Message), or join this discord channel:**

In the future, we hope that transgender girls in China can have their stable and efficient community, which could really provide fundamental aid for poor transgender girls, no matter who they are. We are going to provide them with hope, hope that they can have a new hometown of themselves after they had left their homes – and will be proud to maintain and defend their new hometown on their own hands.",trans,Join Alice’s Sword: an SOS initiative for Chinese transgender girls,1583706477.0,"{'created_utc': 1583681277, 'id': 'ffe0rj', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi there,\n\nWe are a few young students come from China living overseas, looking for help here for poor transgender girls in China, who are now in critical condition.

The consequences are very serious. **Temporarily, we have no channel to get Cyproterone acetate legally or illegally. We need the help of western transgender organizations, or people who can get those medicines, and we hope to establish a stable medicine trade route which could provide low-price medicines for those people who need help**; the earnings of this trade route can be contributed into the fund so that we can provide more practical help.\n\n**2.** We have financial problems and have no link with any people who are willing to provide help for those girls. We are students, financially dependent on our parents, and they do not know what we are doing. Also, the transferring of money is also a problem for us – **we need bank accounts of some western people to avoid the fund monitoring of the communist party.** We will often post some trustable people who are crying for help on our account, and we need a new route to send the aid safely into the hands of those needy.\n\nWe are going to do something for them to change this situation: an initiative of a new homeland for transgender girls. Due to the restriction of our own, the direct help does not work for long; we are rather going to establish an international group in which people in the west can also join and be a part of us. \n\nWe have many experiences to share, but we do not have a detailed route map. We are going to create that together with you and we are willing to be a bridge between you and those needy. **If you can help us with any of the two problems I’ve mentioned above, or you have anything else to help with, contact me (Private Message), or join this discord channel:**\n\n[https://discordapp.com/channels/685854151099547709/685854151531692042](https://discordapp.com/channels/685854151099547709/685854151531692042)\n\nIn the future, we hope that transgender girls in China can have their stable and efficient community, which could really provide fundamental aid for poor transgender girls, no matter who they are. We are going to provide them with hope, hope that they can have a new hometown of themselves after they had left their homes – and will be proud to maintain and defend their new hometown on their own hands.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Join Alice’s Sword: an SOS initiative for Chinese transgender girls', 'created': 1583706477.0}"

Maybe its elaborate imposter syndrome, maybe it's relatable, maybe you'll read it and just think ""yikes"" but I don't know what to do anymore.

My gender is complicated. I suppose I have the ""privilege"" as passing for the wrong one as I work it out.

Transition became trauma.
Deep and tangible.

I lost my marriage for daring to even ask if he'd love me as a boy.
I lost an ex, when I asked the same.

 I hurt and broke and strained a relationship I thought would last forever, but as it turns out internalized transphobia is a thing.

I'll never forget how she was so excited for me, excited to help me transition as she was helped. Came with me to a therapist (a trans man) took me shopping. A dream.
Until it wasn't. 

Suddenly it was fear for the changes, that made sense.
Upset, angry fear as I worked myself out.
Telling me that they ""Don't like fat men"" when as a woman they praised my squish.
Ending in only fucking cis people, they didnt want me anymore.

I didnt even make it to hormones before I completely broke down, ""I'm non-binary**. I was confused, I'm not a boy"".

 It stopped it hurting, until they detranisioned themselves and as they got testosterone in their veins became a different person.

**I don't think everyone who is NB is like me. It's a real valid and tangible thing, I was wrong.

Now, I'm here, staring at my sex marker, counting the times of day I pick ""F"" because it's easier. Because dressing femme is easier. 

Easier, bullshit, it's not. I won't pass as anything else. 
I tried, I just looked heaps butch and basically disappeared. 

Binding was hell, my chest is big, even with a good binder I ended up with migraines with the stress on my neck.

So here I am. A freak, not trans enough.
A boy who looks like a woman and you'd never fucking know.

Ran out of sessions with my therapist, I don't think I could face him. He was going to back me for hormones, I talked it away, ""I'm just NB, I'm NB, I don't want it"".

Feeling completely overwhelmed and unlovable no matter what I do.
Unpassable. Inauthentic.

No offense is ever intended and please do pull me up on it if something ends up inadvertently offensive, but a little patiently? Please?

Okay, so, here it goes. I outwardly identify as Non-Binary (AFAB), and pansexual. However, I'm in an outwardly appearing hetero relationship. We've been together 7 years and have two kids. I used to question my gender a lot in my teens and since I've had my oldest (4) it started again, with lots of pondering a about what or who I really am. Which is when I settled on enby. Now, I had my second (7 months) and it's suddenly ramped up a gear. There's rarely a day that I don't struggle with Gender Dysphoria when I look in the mirror, and as I get older I'm finding myself more and more comfortable presenting male and less presenting female.

I think I'm FtM trans, but I don't want to lose my partner. He's the father of my kids, the love of my life and I've loved him since I was a teenager. As a heterosexual, he's struggling with my masculine days as it is. If I actually went on T and got top surgery and FMS like I want to, I know we wouldn't be able to stay together.

I outwardly identify as Non-Binary (AFAB), and pansexual. However, I'm in an outwardly appearing hetero relationship. We've been together 7 years and have two kids. I used to question my gender a lot in my teens and since I've had my oldest (4) it started again, with lots of pondering a about what or who I really am. Which is when I settled on enby. Now, I had my second (7 months) and it's suddenly ramped up a gear.

2020-03-09 12:00:56,fftl5b,0,1,"Howdy everyone. Posting under anon for piece of mind I guess. This is a bit of a weird question but I don’t know where else to ask this —
TLDR at bottom.

I work in reception in an ER. I’m 22 and have been out of school for almost 4 years now. I was a bit of a teachers pet in school and enjoyed talking with majority of my teachers. I came as trans to a handful of teachers (some were mine, a couple were just teacher friends I could trust). 

Fast forward to now, one of the teachers I knew came into the ER. When she was discharged she was asking me if I was in school and all that Jazz - just catching up. I told her no, just working to help my mom pay bills, etc.

Before she left, she kinda leaned in and asked “So what do we call you now?” Or something along those lines. I got a little confused and gave her a look and just kinda said “nothing?”

I’m running on about 3 hours of sleep but I didn’t realize what I think she was talking about until well after she left. I’m assuming she meant my preferred name.

I’ve been out for roughly 4 years now but haven’t started T or changed my name or anything - I came out to my mom (who is very supportive) via letter because I was still trying to process and accept myself as trans (I grew up with my grandparents being relatively religious and I knew they were going to be kinda edgy about it. My mom isn’t religious or anything and she’s cool with everything). That being said, I’ve been immensely guilty with how I came out to my mom and haven’t sat down to talk to her about it since that happened November 2015 because I’m so uncomfortable with discussing my personal feelings with people. I still live with her so needless to say it’d be kinda hard to start that process without talking to her. My mom is my rock but I don’t know how to talk to her.

ANYWAYS - I live in a small town, not enough for everyone to know everybody but closeish. I have most of these teachers on my Facebook. I can’t remember if I directly told her or if one of the other teachers I came out to told her or if she just realized it herself. it’s been roughly 4-5 hours since I talked to the teacher. Do I just forget about it or do I message her saying something along the lines of “I didn’t realize what you meant due to my lack of sleep but sat down and thought about what you meant and my preferred/chosen name is _____. Assuming that’s what you meant earlier?” 

Note: I’m out to everyone in my department but haven’t directly told any of the nurses I’m close to that I’m trans. I’m sure some have figured it out because when I get consents from patients some will call me sir and they’re in the room I don’t really react to it, and some are on my Instagram and I’m out on ig but not Facebook due to family being on mine.

TLDR: an old teacher of mine came to my workplace and when we were talking when she was leaving she peeked in and asked “so what are we calling you?” (Something along those lines). I was sleep deprived and distracted because I had other things to do and kinda gave her a confused look and said nothing? I realize now she probably meant my preferred/chosen name. I believe she was one of the teachers I came out to in high school (I was close to a handful) but can’t remember. It’s been 4ish hours since I spoke to her and can’t decide if I want to message her something along the lines of “I couldn’t figure out what you were talking about earlier but my chosen name is _____. Im assuming that’s what you meant?” Or to just forget it happened.

I made a big deal the other week about how the doctor is giving me anxiety because they want to know my preferred name and they\'re kind of beating me over the head about it, and I know the words processed through my mother\'s head (she\'s the one who it\'s easier to connect with about this stuff since my father just completely doesn\'t understand) but for some reason it doesn\'t seem to have processed because suddenly she\'s calling me male pronouns seemingly more often then before I made a huge deal about it.

2020-03-10 22:15:07,fgm7dr,4,1,"Hi all!

Yeah, I know I just posted a meme, but this isn't a meme so here we go.

I've known I'm not cis since I knew that being trans was a thing, and I've settled that I'm probably non-binary but leaning extremely masculine. My mom, as much as I love her, was slow to accept, and one of the big points right now is a name.

My deadname is very old and biblical (please don't try to guess it), and I've gone by initials and such for a while now. I don't mind the biblical aspect (I'm protestant) but the only people I've met with my dead name are over 50. So when I decided a new name, as much as I wanted one that was fun, weird, and *me,* I wanted one that wasn't weird.

I'm a huge Welcome to Night Vale fan and fell in love with the name Cecil very quickly. It's been hard figuring out what I wanted, and so when I finally figured out ""no, I like this one, this one's nice,"" I was really glad.

My mom, however, wasn't. She's supportive, but she says she doesn't like that I'm ""naming myself after a podcast"" and that the name gives her ""bad vibes"" from someone she used to know. Many of her suggestions are just as eccentric as my deadname. I don't want to give up Cecil, it took so long to find one that fits.

Do you all have any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

I was having lunch with my dad today and, weirdly, the adoption issue came up in our conversation. We weren’t speaking about trans parents by the way, we were referring to adoption in general.

However...

At some point, I ended saying that I wish, in the future, not to adopt a baby but an older child (maybe between the ages of 6 and 10). Again, the trans thing did not come up (at least not out loud).

Then, my dad started saying the adoption process is incredibly complicated, no matter the age of the child. 

This didn’t bother me. What bothered me was how the discussion ended.

It basically ended by me dad saying that not everyone has to be a parent. 

I  went quiet for a moment and then changed the subject. 

Maybe this wasn’t what he meant when he said those words but my thoughts were quick to travel to the possibility of my dad being sure I would never be able to adopt and this was his way of preparing for the reality that was to come.

Don’t get me wrong, my dad has been really supportive ever since I came out to him and that was only a couple of days ago. But I can’t help but feel miserable because of what he said.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a gay FTM and, even though I might have the “required parts” and am attracted to men, I don’t wish to become pregnant. AT ALL. Pregnancy has always been a great fear of mine, the thought of having a life growing inside me makes me terribly anxious.

I want to have a kid one day though. And I wish to adopt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know of any examples of trans people successfully adopting children? 

&amp;#x200B;

For a gay couple (with at least one trans man included) adoption must be more complicated than for a straight couple (with at least one trans person included). I’m guessing.

Then I got divorced and that fucked everything up. Started questioning on a regular basis but you know, divorce things happened so I didn't have a choice but to ignore it.

So for context we are a DID system and I the current host am a boy inside a girl body. Everyone has agreed to let me cut the body's hair to a shorter length to make me feel more comfortable. right now it sits past shoulder length and i would like it cut almost pixie short with an undercut. Though heres my issue, do I go to the barber or the hair salon because its like it would be nice to be a boy for once and just do boy things and go to the barber like all the other guys but I dont want anyone to be mad at me or tell me to get out / I dont belong there etc. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Am I better off going to a hair salon since the body is physically female ? is there a difference in how a barber cuts hair versus a hair salon results wise??? Has anyone had bad experiences going to a barber in a physically female body?

She started blockers about a year ago, and she started Estradiol about six weeks ago, and she’s had a supportive environment around her from day one. We’ve also found tremendous support in a local trans families support group. 

Today, she achieved a personal best in her Girl’s 50-yd Butterfly swim event. Coming off the heels of a devastating “almost but not quite” time last week at a swim event, this was a huge achievement for her. 

She’s been happy, she’s worked through her big feelings, and she’s grown as a person beyond her age in the last year. As a father, I can’t really explain how it feels when your child bursts into happy tears at achieving something that seemed insurmountable at one time. It was an amazing moment and I’m tearing up even thinking about it. 

My eagerness to be the best dad I can be is only one small part of it, though. Her mom has been a tireless advocate and caretaker, and her three siblings (two of which identify and live amongst the LGTBQIA community as well) have also been incredibly supportive. 

I’d like to think that being a proud dad isn’t exceptional when your child does something amazing and grows, but I know all too well that given the world we live in, sadly, it is. 

Many of you expressed a vicarious happiness and appreciation on her behalf because you have known what it feels like to lack that kind of love and support, and all I can say to you is that I love you all, too. You ARE loved. You have used your pain to help guide a parent through new, uncharted areas and I can’t possibly express to you my gratitude for the kindness you’ve shown me in my time of need. You are all amazing, loving people that I consider close to my heart. You are family. 

Your selfless effort to help me put aside my fears and uncertainty as a parent has paid great dividends in the life she now enjoys, and I hope that you feel the warmth and appreciation and love I’m trying to express to you in this moment.

Traps are members of one gender that often look, dress, and sometimes act like the other gender without identifying as that gender, often in a sexual way.

A Sissy is a man who gets humiliated and/or feminized in a sexual way, normally by a master/mistress.

A Drag Queen is a person, usually male, who uses drag clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes.

A Transwoman is a woman who was assigned male at birth. Trans women experience gender dysphoria and usually transition; this process commonly includes hormone replacement therapy and sometimes sex reassignment surgery, which can bring relief and resolve feelings of gender dysphoria.

And this is with my default fitness, never really trained \*Hard\*, I just have a naturally lean, flexible and sporty body and love to get into team sports.

More recently I've been getting into Ultimate frisbee, and I'm in a position where I've been accepted through trials onto a club team in the UK and have a lot of people, friends and strangers a like, insisting and encouraging me to go further, applying for u24 teams and it seems I have a real opportunity to go far; I've never found a sport which I can do so well at before and I love it.

Here’s what happened: 

I’m at work and it’s the end of the day before vacation for most of us. There’s a few of us sitting around telling stories, and it gets a little out of hand. One of my supervisors is a few offices over (male to female trans, mid-transition) and she tells us to knock it off because we know better (our conversation wasn’t hateful or phobic in any way it just probably wasn’t suitable for the workplace and it’s her job to enforce that as a PR rep) 

So we shut up and I said “yes sir!”

I misgendered her.

I was mortified with myself the moment it left my lips. She corrected me from afar and the crowd dispersed awkwardly. I immediately went to apologize, and she accepted, but I could tell that it stung. 

This isn’t a new thing. She’s been in transition for well over a year and I’ve had many many dealings with her since. It’s never happened before, and I 100% knew better. 

It slipped out because I knew this individual pre-transition. I knew her when she was still a man. In fact we probably worked together more often back then. 

But that doesn’t excuse it at all and I still feel awful. She’s been having a hard time with everything lately. 

I don’t know what to do because I feel like if I reach out again, I’ll just make her feel like I think she’s super fragile or something.

2020-03-15 01:22:44,fite5w,2,1,"My earliest memory that I can remember so distinctly, was in eighth grade. This was when gay marriage was passed by Congress to become legal in all states. I hated it, we had a debate at the beginning of the year on anything of our choice in my history class. We had many debates after about many different topics, but this one was on the hot button issue of gay marriage. It’s crazy to me how quickly things have changed for society. (I should add to this story I’m Christian and have been raised as such) 

Five years ago (I’m 17 now going on 18, a senior in high school) half that class stood against the topic of gay marriage. Half of my class couldn’t stand the thought of a man loving another man. I was on that side. I debated it vigorously that day and remember, bringing up how unhealthy and unnatural it was. What I was doing was not OK. I led that debate that day I recall. 

A year passed and I entered high school. It was so strange. We had and have now a LGBTQ club that eventually became known as the queer straight alliance. They met once a week at lunch in a teacher‘s classroom and maybe once or twice a month they come out to the courtyard and pass out lollipops or give out stuff just to be nice. Me and my friends purposely sat next to that table. We attacked them, I did the most, I didn’t care what they thought besides “they are just a bunch of fags” I’d say. We’d walk over to their peaceful table. We’d start drama. The same thing was said as was a year prior. I called them stupid, I called them unnatural, and use “queer” negatively and call them “fags” to their faces. I would even go as far as to insult their look, I would call them ugly and harass them. There was no justice for what I did. For all of the things I gotten in trouble for my freshman year though, which trust me, no exaggeration, I was in the office at least once every 2 weeks, I never got in trouble for that. Not one person chose to report me or my friends, I do not know if the teacher was aware or not, but I also know I wasn’t the only one with my friends but I do know I was doing the most. To be perfectly honest, I don’t know why. It was straight verbal abuse, to anyone I knew was gay. And to trans people? I was even worse, I refuse to call them by their proper genders and in most cases I would call them by their dead names to their face as much as possible.

Where did all this come from you may ask? Why was I so against the LGBTQ community? I can’t really give you an answer. It wasn’t cause I was Christian, I lost my faith completely my freshman year. I can remember being bullied by other kids when I was much younger and being called gay and a thousand variations. These were always used as insults. I have always acted “girly” And people have always insulted me by calling me gay or a pussy for acting as such, my dad was always super against it too. He always has taught me to man up and be more like a man. I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve seen him roll his eyes and sigh when he sees a gay man on the screen when we are watching TV. He has always taught me that being gay was wrong, “it is a mental illness that needs to be dealt with” these things were just burned in my head to tell me that it was wrong I guess, I guess that’s why I took it out on other people. But I promise you that’s not an excuse.

My sophomore year was very similar to my freshman year, not as bad, but I still don’t know how those people put up with me. But that summer, I went to a Christian camp I went to every year well over 1000 kids go each year and it’s honestly an amazing event. I was just an angry kid, a sophomore transitioning to be a junior, I didn’t wanna be there. All I could think was God was stupid, he didn’t exist and that I could be doing literally anything else. A couple days later I restored my faith. I am not going to go into the details of it, that’s not what this post is about, but I’ll leave it at I felt his presence and I knew he was there for me. That week my whole perspective was changed. Not only did I once again for heartedly believe in God again after cursing him and denying him for so long and so hard. but I had realized the faults in me harassing everyone in the LGBTQ community. As a believer in Christ, it’s not my duty to judge anyone no matter what. I adopted that belief and changed my ways. Instead of walking up to them, I just chose to ignore them. I called other people out on it to. I had a different group of friends at this time, my junior year of high school. My friends were still quite homophobic. They used to make snarky comments about them at our table but they did stop to their face. I would think because of me stopping it.

Now here I am, and the past year has been so moving. I believe I’ve grown to truly know myself after blocking out who I was for so long without even realizing it. I had a friend who was in the a cappella club at our school. She competed with them in the past year and she had a lot of fun with it. I mentioned before that I got teased for being girly at times and was called gay myself as an insult. Well this was one of the things that I was called girly for. She encouraged me to try out for the team who was entirely girls except for one trans boy who unfortunately has parents that are completely unsupportive and refused to help him in his journey. I had never sang before. I would sing alone in my room or in the shower to the punk rock songs I would listen to and still listen to today, and if you’ve ever heard a punk singer they’re not usually the best, and that’s what I was always trying to mimic. When I tried out, apparently I had a fantastic audition. I was near exactly what they needed.

The teacher however is gay. I mentioned there was a trans boy in the club already. It was discussed between the team weather to have me join or not because of that. Apparently the boy whom was a sophomore didn’t know just how awful I was. When he was a freshman, I was a junior and didn’t care as much about harassing people. Because he didn’t know just how bad I was, they let me in. I made the team. I remember a day Later after my first audition and was on the call backs sheet, I was called to see the teacher. I assumed it was about my homophobia. I assumed it was about my trans phobia but even he looked passed it. The meeting was about me not being able to read music, and how all of the other people that auditioned could read music. He talked to me about how my vocal recall was near perfect especially if for not doing anything in music before in my life. The conversation wasn’t about a cappella. He wanted me to join chamber choir as well. The boy who I previously mentioned was also in chamber choir. But there were many other boys in the choir in general, it was a tightknit group though. There is only 14 of us. I agree to have my schedule changed and from that point I was in chamber choir and soon after I made the a cappella team.

Because our choir teacher is gay, he has drawn the attention of my other LGBT people in our school. There are many people in the LGBT community that are in many of the choirs. With the boy, it took me a very long time to get used to him but I was for sure tolerant. I refused, not openly, but in my own head to call him “him/he“ I would strictly call him by his name. I would never use a pronoun around him. It just made me uncomfortable I guess. But I got used to the idea of being around people of the LGBT community grew fond of them even. That boy became someone I truly admired and was inspired by we work together because we had the same voice part and that’s when it started for me.

After being around and accepting these people for who they were, I took down so many mental barriers I had in my own mind. And finally in November, I realized something. I was bisexual, I definitely lean more towards women but there were many guys that I realized I had feelings toward, ironically enough I realized subconsciously I had feelings for one of my friends who helped me harass LGBTQ community three years prior. I realized my freshman year I was totally crushing on him I just didn’t know it. But when I realized it was a shock because of my history. Immediately though I was so proud of my “discovery“ that within a week I came out to friends and school. I felt so proud that I made a Epiphany or a realization of myself I wanted everyone to know it. I eventually told my brother about a month ago but he was the first person in my family and for now the last person in my family to know. The time between November to early January was hard. I spent several combined hours tracking down people I had harassed in the past.  Many of them who I could barely remember their name if I remembered their name. I spent several combined hours after that writing each and everyone of them letters of apologies and to my surprise each and everyone of them forgave me. It was amazing. I would have never thought. I never had messaged them looking for acceptance or forgiveness because I never thought I’d get it. I messaged them to strictly apologize for my actions. I apologized because they realize how special it was to be able to be so open about your sexuality and I took away so much of that from so many of those people.

A couple months ago I started for no reason at all accepting  my girly side more. And couple months ago I started for no reason at all painting my nails and trying on crop tops and turning a pair of basketball shorts and do a skirt. I would always put the stuff on in the bathroom and I try to do my make up and such but it never stayed on. I would admire how my body looked in the girly clothes that I made. But in the end I always took it off before leaving the bathroom to avoid anyone from seeing. I had three friends eventually opened up to about the situation and have been pretty supportive. No matter how much I tried on the clothes I made along with a few other different styles, how much I enjoyed putting on the make up Or trying change my voice online to sound like a girl, “just to experiment” I guess is what I’ve been calling it, it wasn’t enough. It was my hairy body that led me to be uncomfortable. It was my voice that couldn’t get to get high enough. I started to realize as well that throughout my 17+ years I’ve had many subtle signs I have wanted to be a girl. I started investing so much time into my “cross dressing“ as a refuse to call anything else that I started saving money for a wig and money for a skirt and I kept on fantasizing by myself and about myself being a girl. I’ve always had thoughts like that but I’ve never taken them seriously. It wasn’t till couple weeks ago to a week ago I truly accepted in my brain that I might actually be trans. In the past week I both shaved my legs and my arms and the rest of my body as well as ordered my first wig and skirt today. 

Socially, I don’t know if I’ll ever come out at school. I’m still kind of denying it to a point I guess “I just have to experiment a little more” this is always what I tell myself. I know I can’t tell my family. But I’m starting to realize who I am and I’m so grateful to the people who have got me here. I extend my apology to you, the reader if you identify yourself with the LGBTQ community. I’m sorry for my actions towards your community. I’m sorry for taking away something from people so near and dear to them. Thank you for reading up to this point at least I know it’s a lot but it’s also a lot off my chest.

A 5 year confessional story to where I am today.,1584260564.0,"{'created_utc': 1584235364, 'id': 'fite5w', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'My earliest memory that I can remember so distinctly, was in eighth grade. This was when gay marriage was passed by Congress to become legal in all states. I hated it, we had a debate at the beginning of the year on anything of our choice in my history class. We had many debates after about many different topics, but this one was on the hot button issue of gay marriage. It’s crazy to me how quickly things have changed for society. (I should add to this story I’m Christian and have been raised as such) \n\nFive years ago (I’m 17 now going on 18, a senior in high school) half that class stood against the topic of gay marriage. Half of my class couldn’t stand the thought of a man loving another man. I was on that side. I debated it vigorously that day and remember, bringing up how unhealthy and unnatural it was. What I was doing was not OK. I led that debate that day I recall. \n\nA year passed and I entered high school. It was so strange. We had and have now a LGBTQ club that eventually became known as the queer straight alliance. They met once a week at lunch in a teacher‘s classroom and maybe once or twice a month they come out to the courtyard and pass out lollipops or give out stuff just to be nice. Me and my friends purposely sat next to that table. We attacked them, I did the most, I didn’t care what they thought besides “they are just a bunch of fags” I’d say. We’d walk over to their peaceful table. We’d start drama. The same thing was said as was a year prior. I called them stupid, I called them unnatural, and use “queer” negatively and call them “fags” to their faces. I would even go as far as to insult their look, I would call them ugly and harass them. There was no justice for what I did. For all of the things I gotten in trouble for my freshman year though, which trust me, no exaggeration, I was in the office at least once every 2 weeks, I never got in trouble for that. Not one person chose to report me or my friends, I do not know if the teacher was aware or not, but I also know I wasn’t the only one with my friends but I do know I was doing the most. To be perfectly honest, I don’t know why. It was straight verbal abuse, to anyone I knew was gay. And to trans people? I was even worse, I refuse to call them by their proper genders and in most cases I would call them by their dead names to their face as much as possible.\n\nWhere did all this come from you may ask? Why was I so against the LGBTQ community? I can’t really give you an answer. It wasn’t cause I was Christian, I lost my faith completely my freshman year. I can remember being bullied by other kids when I was much younger and being called gay and a thousand variations. These were always used as insults. I have always acted “girly” And people have always insulted me by calling me gay or a pussy for acting as such, my dad was always super against it too. He always has taught me to man up and be more like a man. I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve seen him roll his eyes and sigh when he sees a gay man on the screen when we are watching TV. He has always taught me that being gay was wrong, “it is a mental illness that needs to be dealt with” these things were just burned in my head to tell me that it was wrong I guess, I guess that’s why I took it out on other people. But I promise you that’s not an excuse.\n\nMy sophomore year was very similar to my freshman year, not as bad, but I still don’t know how those people put up with me. But that summer, I went to a Christian camp I went to every year well over 1000 kids go each year and it’s honestly an amazing event. I was just an angry kid, a sophomore transitioning to be a junior, I didn’t wanna be there. All I could think was God was stupid, he didn’t exist and that I could be doing literally anything else. A couple days later I restored my faith. I am not going to go into the details of it, that’s not what this post is about, but I’ll leave it at I felt his presence and I knew he was there for me. That week my whole perspective was changed. Not only did I once again for heartedly believe in God again after cursing him and denying him for so long and so hard. but I had realized the faults in me harassing everyone in the LGBTQ community. As a believer in Christ, it’s not my duty to judge anyone no matter what. I adopted that belief and changed my ways. Instead of walking up to them, I just chose to ignore them. I called other people out on it to. I had a different group of friends at this time, my junior year of high school. My friends were still quite homophobic. They used to make snarky comments about them at our table but they did stop to their face. I would think because of me stopping it.\n\nNow here I am, and the past year has been so moving. I believe I’ve grown to truly know myself after blocking out who I was for so long without even realizing it. I had a friend who was in the a cappella club at our school. She competed with them in the past year and she had a lot of fun with it. I mentioned before that I got teased for being girly at times and was called gay myself as an insult. Well this was one of the things that I was called girly for. She encouraged me to try out for the team who was entirely girls except for one trans boy who unfortunately has parents that are completely unsupportive and refused to help him in his journey. I had never sang before. I would sing alone in my room or in the shower to the punk rock songs I would listen to and still listen to today, and if you’ve ever heard a punk singer they’re not usually the best, and that’s what I was always trying to mimic.

2020-03-15 03:33:48,fiv5tk,1,1,"So I came out to my mother a couple months ago and she said that she'd support me no matter what. As much as I hate to admit it, it doesn't seem like she supports me at all. She still dead names me and yes, I know it takes time for parents to come to terms with their kid wanting to be the other gender, but she doesn't even try to correct herself and I'm too afraid to do it for her. 

Staying on the topic of names, when I came out she asked me what I'd like to be called. I told her maybe Jared or Mathias but she said she couldnt do that because they were too masculine. So then I had to have my therapist to convince her to at least call me Jay because 1) its androgynous 2) sounds like the first letter of my dead name. She said she could do that because it's the name of one of her female  coworkers which made me all the more uncomfortable. So now when she dead names or actually calls me Jay, in her head shes relating that back to me being female.

That brings me to everyone else. My step-father doesn't seem to care which I'm fortunate of because I'd rather have someone not care at all than care too much. My brother purposely makes fun of me and puts an emphasis on things like ""you're so *beautiful*"" ""Mother, *sister* won't get off the xbox*"" ""you'll always be a *girl and my sister*"" and it fucking hurts like getting kicked in the teeth. They know that I want to be a guy I have been since I was twelve, i'm fifteen now. I tried being a girl and I don't like it. Stop with the she/her pronouns like please. I told them this is one reason I'm suicidal but they think it's the most minuscule reason. Add that it seems like my moms stalling on letting me get a haircut and every hair salon or barber I go to say they can't cut my hair to look masc. Because it's ""too curly."" 

That reminds me, one of my aunts came over today and my mom referenced me as Jay. My aunt was confused and then I told her I was FtM so then she proceeded to scold me and my parents just shrugged. 

Add that people at school still consider me female and everyone considers me female and I havent been able to go to therapy because of the whole quarantine thing going on and everything just sucks.

In conclusion, even though my family says they accept me for wanting to be a guy, they obviously don't and its getting to the point where I want to literally hang myself because the dysphoria is so bad.

Let me be clear, I LOVE my mom to death. I know some people who go to child services because they're parents don't accept them. I don't want that I'd hate myself even more if that happened. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Ahem, now that's said I am writing this to get mentorship on how others have been interpreting the relatively new response to ""Are transwomen women?"" That being: ""transwomen are transwomen"". This perspective has been spread by prominent YouTubers since the start of 2020. Controversial figures such as B. White, A. Scarcella, and some of their fanbases have shared this response.

**Let me try to objectively summarize their ideas:**

1. Transwomen lack ovaries and a uterus ergo cannot and ought not to participate in conversations related to such.
2. Women (read cis-women) are already under siege by misogynists, so including transwomen as women weakens their abilities to maintain women's rights progress with conservatives.
3. Transwomen are just different so it is alright to make them their own group. Saying ""transwomen are women"" is disingenuous to these differences.

**Now let me try to objectively refute each idea:**

1. This erases and invalidates the voices of cis-women who lack ovaries/uteri due to surgeries, developmental diseases, or being intersex. According to the opposing sides logic, these women also cannot participate in conversations related to periods, childbearing, etc. They fail to see that the perspectives and struggles of women who either never had or had removed these organs. Learning from their stories can strengthen all women regardless of cis or trans.
2. Who do we really help when any of us pander to the approval of misogynists or any group that impedes progress of women's rights? The women's suffrage movement of the early 20th century did not go after sympathy by saying ""oh don't worry gentlemen, it's not like we are saying we want women of color to vote, just racially approved groups of women"". **NO**. They said ALL WOMEN have the right to vote. Anything less than that was not a victory. The more women fragment themselves into factions or exclude each other on the basis of identity, the ones who oppose us win and will keep winning.
3. It **is** disingenuous to brush aside differences; however, this is never a reason for removing the subset from a group (which is one purpose behind ""transwomen are transwomen""). A continually area of improvement in American feminism is considering how women of color face different yet related issues. Or women in lower socioeconomic classes. Basically any group of women outside the racial, socioeconomic majority. Just because we have differences does not make it ok to segregate. The most beautiful quilts are never made from a single patch. Deciding to make the ""transwomen are transwomen"" segregation invites transphobia, skepticism and perpetuates echoes of racism. We never debate things like ""black women are black women, but not women"" (or at least I pray we no longer do), so why should we continue to phrase things that promote the same kind of holier-than-thou mentality in any discussion amongst women?

If none of these above rebuttals convince anyone that we need to assert ""transwomen are women"", I propose we consider the following fallacy in the dissenting group's argument:

**Claiming there are only 2 genders and yet ""transwomen are transwomen"" simply does not follow societal or biological perspectives.**

B. White, A. Scarcella, et al. have gone into lengthy discussions on how biology dictates transwomen are ""male"" and transmen are ""female"" because gender designations of male/female are a biological definition. Mentions of intersex individuals are treated by them as outside the norm, or even phrased as ""genetic mutations"". As a transwoman I know how much it hurts to be called degenerate or a monster, and I despise the thought of an intersex person being called a ""genetic mutation"". The phrasing is dehumanizing and convinces society that this class of individuals was born as a ""mistake"" and needs to pick between the binary to correct the ""wrong"". Would it not make more sense to have the compassionate, and actually objective, perspective that clearly there is more than just the binary? 

This inability to acknowledge that there is more than just male/female at the most fundamental **biological** level establishes a paradox. If gender can only be a binary, then what is meant by ""transwomen are transwomen""? Aren't they effectively increasing the number of ""approved"" groups from two to four (men, women, transmen, transwomen)?

B. White, A. Scarcella, et al. would quickly reject this and say that this is not their conclusion. Gender is still binary, rather it is the social constructs that go from two to four. They claim, for instance, ""woman"" and ""female"" are two separate meanings. ""Woman"" is a societal interpretation of an individual while ""female"" is the biological interpretation. Being a transwoman then is what exactly? They claim that transwomen are ""male"", not female. Society may perceive them as women but under all that social fabric is a ""male"" biology. So saying ""transwomen are men"" conflicts with a societal perception and yet ""transwomen are women"" conflicts with their biological assertion that women are female. Thus, they pose ""transwomen are transwomen"" to satisfy society and biology at the same time.

Seems like a stalemate, right?  Not quite. There is the over obsession of **biological correctness** (funny considering how B. White especially complains about political correctness). The [Intersex Society of North America](https://isna.org/faq/frequency/) provides the conservative estimate that the ""\[t\]otal number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female \[is\] one in 100 births."" 

Biology is just as complex as gender. Throw in the abundance of science that asserts gender is actually biological and you have quite the mess on your hands when you talk about stuff like ""transwomen aren't women"". Anyone willing to defend that sentiment needs to answer the real consequences of **both** silencing the voices of intersex people who know themselves as non-binary or outside the binary, and segregating intersex women outside of womanhood only because her biology is not up to some flawless standard. Are we going to start saying things like ""intersex women aren't women; intersex women are intersex women and that's ok since they are just different""? Doing anything of sort only demonstrates one thing: you are using **your standards** to define and divide people into does/does not belong categories. Doing this on an individual level is just poor taste. Doing this on a society scale is discriminatory and unjust.

So in this series, the heartless represent the tiny madnesses we all contend with (at least for me), a common one for trans people is genital dysphoria, which I have bad. Whenever I get dressed up, my wife tries to warn me if my dick is showing and that is usually enough to trigger my Heartless and totally demolish my day. The reason I call it my Heartless is because this thing is a combination of a trigger and the horrible things I do to myself and those I love when it comes to the surface. 

My wife triggered that component of my Heartless this morning. I'm usually a nudist but when she does this I always feel compelled to wear really baggy clothes.

I... admit I was verbally abusive even though I knew consciously that she was trying to help. I didnt call her names but I did accuse her of choosing to say the worst thing she could have possibly said.

When I feel it rippling through me I usually try to close myself off physically so that I dont do or say something I dont mean. It's a dissociative experience in some senses... the thing I am consciously thinking and the things my body and emotions are doing are completely different and I feel like I dont have control over myself. Problem is she interprets it as me punishing her but I know that if I do anything else I'll say something horrible.

2020-03-17 05:46:07,fk001y,15,1,"Hi! I'm a 20 year old transgender woman and this is my first post!

Okay, so, I really need some advice. Right now I am around 140-144 pounds (63.5kg) and 5'11"" (180.3cm).

 I really want to get down to 120 pounds (54.4kg) and I know by doing this I will reduce a significant amount of muscle, seeing that I don't have a lot of body fat to lose in the first place, which is the goal seeing that I have a somewhat bulky upper body, shoulders, and biceps. 

I've only been on estrogen for four months (still, super awesome!) and I know that it helps in muscle mass reduction (or at least, it can) but I am tired of looking in the mirror and seeing broad shoulders and a broad chest. I just want to lose 20 pounds via dieting and exercise and overall I want to look more petite--because I am quite a tall girl and I can't reduce my height so weight is my only option.

 I don't want to maintain a weight of 120 pounds forever--but at least until I can slowly gain it back in fat that will redistribute to my hips and thighs--which I already have a decent amount of, but I don't mind losing temporarily so I can lose this muscle in my upper body. 

Thanks for reading this long-ish post, if you're still here.

&amp;#x200B;

SO! Here is my question(s): 

1. Does anyone have any tips on losing weight/specifically muscle in a way that's as healthy as possible?
2. Does anyone know someone who is around my height (5'11"") and 120 pounds? Whether they be a celebrity or whoever.

(I appreciate my body and it does an amazing job at keeping me alive, I just want to feel better in it.)

I'm a 15 year old ftm who came out to my parents a few months ago, yet they don't seem to understand my problem.

My father is pretty chill about it, and he tries to call me by my prefered name, aka my nickname which is a genderneutral name. 

My mother on the other hand, coming from poland, said she understood. But she doesn't seem to believe me, or doesn't want to believe it. She rarely ever calls me by my prefered name.

I've been feeling this way since I entered 5th grade, which in germany is the beginning of the 2nd school you go to.

I guess I just noticed it more since the differences started to become more obvious in that age. 

I have only come out to my online friends and some of my closest friends but that was it. 

I had asked my mother if I could buy myself a binder, since my rather large breasts are a thing I constantly am worried and get breakdowns about. She just replied with ""no, it's too early"" and suggested to get more sports bras. But they don't help at all, since my chest is too large and is noticable even with sports bras.

That was two weeks ago and we originally wanted to call up a therapist. They forgot it multiple times, I had to remind them, and when they actually remembered, which was today, my mum just said that it was probably closed anyways because of the coronavirus. 

I've been feeling helpless currently and wanted to ask, am I too forward with it? Is the thing with the binder too early, and if not, how can I convince them otherwise?

Background: I'm a (31 y.o) straight white male and don't have a lot of experience with this.  Please excuse my pronoun reference, (pronouns will be treated as per chronological events. Again, I apologize in advance if this is the incorrect way to approach this)

My cousin in law (14 y.o.)  came out as gay to the whole family \~a year ago (which didn't necessarily come as a huge surprise &amp; everyone in the family has been supportive).  

Today she told everyone that he was going to start his physical transformation (I.E. hormone therapy F to M).  I'm sure that he has thought about this for a while but I'm still nervous that starting hormones this early in his life could get messy and cause further complications .  I want to be supportive but from what I've read, this life changing event can EXTREMELY difficult/expensive especially at a time when hormones are already going crazy.  While I haven't experienced anything quite like this magnitude to my personal identity, I definitely had acne, was teased (like most kids), and am hoping that this decision isn't one that could be one that he wished he could have said ""I wish I would have just waited a couple more years before making that decision"".  

I want to be supportive but I also am hoping for a little guidance from the community by answering a few questions to get a better sense of the timeline I can expect.  

1. How long was it from when you verbalized  to someone that you wanted to go through hormone therapy to the time time you actually started hormone therapy?
2. How old were you and is there an ideal age to go through this transformation?
3. How difficult/taxing was the introduction of hormones to your body?

First of all, gender roles fucking suck. I'm emotional and caring, and don't like sportsball, but equally I'm interested in swords and machinery and fart jokes. Gender!=sex, and even sex isn't binary. So I guess I'm non-binary? Honestly, I've always been labelled a guy, but don't much care for what pronouns people use for me.

2020-03-19 02:11:40,fl216l,1,1,"Would you consider this to be dysphoria?

I’m a 19y old AFAB (assigned female at birth) and have been questioning my gender/sexuality for the past few years (strongly present since 4 years).

I’ve always been considered a tomboy since…ever. Most of my friends were always guys, played soccer with them, I found dolls disgusting, never wanted to wear pink, cars and lego were my main toys as a child, wanted to play active and rough games (not just chatting as the girls did),…

And since the age of 3 I wanted to be able to pee standing up.

Around early puberty I felt te urge to fit in and started to go along more with girls (10-12y). Also, because the boys started to question me. I became somewhat more feminine (not extremely). But when starting high school at age 11, the pressure to fit in that I caused myself was really intense. I appeared normal girly but no make-up, never nails done, no extremely long hair,… I wanted a “boyfriend”. I wanted to be “normal” as this was a new school, a new start… I just wanted to feel accepted and appreciated.

But at the same time, my body was changing and I was struggling a lot with that. I always told my mom and sister (since I was 9y or so) that I would get my boobs “amputated” when I would grow boobs and get myself sterilized (without realizing that was quite shocking to hear for my relatives) as I never wanted to get a period (but I learned to deal with it). As controverse as possible with my outer apearance, around age 11, when I was trying so hard to fit in, I started to wear boys briefs,(I liked it, certainly since slight curves were coming in). I also shaved my upper lip (family didn’t know that) daily with my brother’s razor blade and a ton of shaving cream.

I was in a very bad place when I was 12. Certainly due to this but also some other small tings that contributed to it. I got medicated pretty bad for the following 3 years (don’t remember much of that time). When I slowly tapered off from meds around age 15, I became back more lucid and I started to think about the things I was (how I felt, how I am and behaved).I suppose I should’ve done that the years previous to that but I was just too drugged.

I daily went to the gym and got a rock hard crush on a girl I don’t even know her name up till this day. It was something I didn’t expect to happen and was quite shocked from myself. I never thought about it before. Although, I need to admit that I was kinda “in love” with a girl at elementary school (if you could call that a crush on that age). I was really amazed by that girl when I saw her. And even tough I knew she had a boyfriend I always tried to “impress” her when she looked over to me. I liked going to the gym but I also hated it somewhat. The frustration was big when I saw how fast younger guys gained muscle so easily and I was just working out non stop and realized I was never going to be ripped.

I was sad, angry and all other things at the same time I guess. Because I just didn’t understand what and why I was feeling this way. I couldn’t tell anyone but I also couldn’t express myself (not even to myself if that makes sense?). I had no words for most things I felt which makes a discussion not easy, if not impossible.

Around that same time, I met back an old friend of mine (15, almost 16y old then). We shared many personal things and for one reason or another (which was again, not communicated well from my side) we started something together. I thought I had been clear to him about it that it was just for the experience(s). Don’t get me wrong, I like(d) him a lot but I was not attracted to him in any way. Looking back at it, I was in such a rush to “have done it”. I think I just wanted to make sure that that was not the thing for me. I enjoyed the time we shared. But I never wanted to take my t-shirt off and I was always so anxious of potentially getting pregnant (even though we did it always safe). He also wanted to cuddle and be affectionous afterwards when I just wanted to sleep or go further with what I was doing beforehand (this gave some tension).

When I was 16, I decided that it was not really what I wanted (even though I don’t regret it). Due to circumstances we had less contact at the time following that decision (he didn’t understand it, and felt used even though that was not my intension). We have contact again since some time and everything calmed down and he tries to understand it.

If I would ever end up in a relationship, I guess that would be with a woman then (but love happens and doesn't wear tags or labels so I would just let it come over me).

I was very lonely and I was not in the position to tell my family (I’m still in such position). I started to dress even more masculine and got my hair somewhat shorter and I really liked it. I went to a boarding school and people stared at me certain times but at that age (almost 17), I didn’t really care what people were thinking about me anymore (but of course, I was aware of it).

Got down again, never finished high school (trying to pursue that at the moment) and I was really unhappy. I’ve looked up every possible surgery and if you would’ve asked me then, I would have jumped right into it.

Turning 18, I got pointed to my responsibilities (like studying, being more helpful). Also, my mom was more down (which she’d never been before) so my attention went to “surviving” and just trying to deal with daily life (not so successful as I’m always very unmotivated, tired and down).

I tried to focus on other things and just let it be for what it was. I didn’t and still don’t understand why I care so much about it. I don’t care if I’m slim or carry a bit of fat, nor do I care about my crooked nose, dressing style,…

So why would I care so much about other, simple body parts? I mean, if it’s functional that’s the main key. Everything’s working as it should. Why do I feel unhappy about something that is so relative in life? A body is nothing really more than a medium to live.

I’m very uncomfortable with my breasts and have always refused (which caused some heated discussions with my mom) to wear a bra in the past. I used to wear baggy shirts and possibly a jacket on top so it wouldn’t be as noticeable. Some time ago I bought a binder and since then I feel comfortable going out in a t-shirt. I like to be naked at home (which is good, as so I don’t wear my binder for too long) but I hate to look down at myself or in the mirror. There are certainly things I like about my body. I’ve relatively wide shoulders and masculine (or at least not feminine for sure) hands. My legs are pretty hairy which I’m quite proud of (as are my armpits). I’ve not such a good relation with my genitals. I’ve always wanted a penis and I’m very distressed by that. I’m fine with sitting down on the toilet to pee but when it comes down to being sexually active, I’m not so. I’ve always had a very high sex drive (which is not helping) but I get pretty frustrated and upset when I’m masturbating and can’t focus on being turned on. Porn helps a lot with that (but I’m easily distracted anyways, porn or no porn). It also prevents me for looking out for a relationship. The awareness of not having something over there that I feel I should (it’s like I even can feel/imagine how it should be) is making me so insecure.

I had the urge to cut my breasts off and looked everything up on the internet (like what kind of meds/painkillers I would need and bandages,…). But something like that is very dangerous and not rational at all. Even though I knew I shouldn’t (as it would never turn out well) it was still a strong wish. I did stop ideation about it but not much change so far.

But the main thing why I question if I am trans or not is that I don’t really mind social presentation. Like, I wanted to have a boys name for a very long time. But now, I don’t even really mind it anymore. I don’t mind how others see me on a daily basis. Although it makes me insecure being “short”, not having male characteristics as much,… As it seems on the internet, that most trans folks are mainly worried about how they’d be perceived by society. I know how I feel, I don’t need society’s approval for how I feel. But I question if I should act on what I feel. There are so many other things in life that should be way more important (certainly since I don’t care what society thinks). But I am concerned about safety of course (there would be many countries that I won’t be able to visit anymore). I wouldn’t want people to know, as so they would see me as the “transgender”. But the process is long, I have better investments to be done with my money and my family would despise me and my mother (it would be her fault…).

I need to mention that I have a diagnosis of autism, ocd and am on multiple meds to try and cope with daily life.

2020-03-19 12:01:18,fl8w1s,0,1,"(CW: I’m going to talk a bit about self harm and dysphoria) 

For the past couple of days I’ve been kinda off, I have anxiety and it tends to build up over time and reach a tipping point where I usually experience panic attacks and that combined with my dysphoria at the moment has been difficult. I’m afab and my main source of dysphoria has always been my chest, usually I just feel distressed or disgusted by their... presence and I usually just feel shitty about it and try to ignore it but sometimes I get worried that I’m not dysphoric enough and I push it or I’m reaching my anxiety tipping point and it sets me off, either way I always get a panic attack and recently I’ve started cutting again. I cut for two years and then I had an incident where it went too far and it was a whole thing with my parents so I tried to quit and I was pretty clean for the next two years with maybe 3 or 4 minor relapses. This year, within the part 3 months I have had 4 relapses. I know that if I try to tell my friends or family or my therapist that it will cause others pain and I’ll be putting them through all of this shit again but I’m worried that if I don’t get it outside of my brain that it’s just going to get worse. I relapsed last night after I tried wearing a sports shirt in the shower to help with the heightened dysphoria, it made it so much worse and I just got out and did it but it wasn’t as mild as the last 3 and that scared me and I don’t know any other way to explain it but it felt like that my anxiety on tipping point was just vining in the point or extending it idk. I felt numb and shakey and I couldn’t stop thinking about how trapped I feel within this body and how fucking suffocating it is to have other people look at you like your someone else and when you try to get some sort of piece of mind like through binding or talking about medical transition, your name, your pronouns or having to try and fail to explain dysphoria in a way that they can understand the absolute fucking weight of the feeling, it just makes them uncomfortable and they don’t talk to you. I’m so scared that I’ll never be able to be myself or that when I do everyone I love will leave me. I skipped school today so that I could try to control my anxiety before everything gets bad again and it didn’t really work, I was home-alone for most of the day so I was able to feel comfortable as myself and I even felt good enough to wear some eyeliner and then my family got home and they knew I was not having a great time so they tried to make me feel better by saying the makeup suited me and the snow jumper I was wearing was like my new home but it just began to build everything up again. My dad got home and he’s not really on board with my name yet so he calls me by my old initials which used to be fine but it just reminds me that at one point the way I lived and the way other people saw me was wrong for lack of a better word, I can’t stand the thought of how I used to look and that name and just everything and every time he uses that reference to my name it reminds me of how much my transition has and will take.

2020-03-19 14:11:34,flanaa,0,1,"Reddit, for me, have been and incredible tool in my transition, If it wasnt for ppl like you I'll never have started this journey, so I want to talk about something that may, or may not, help someone up.

And to be clear, this is about a girl in this sub, for who I have only respect and I miss her very much, but I get that sometime ppl just pass by and leave you with a good memory, I'll not say who she is, maybe she never see that, because she don't care for me anymore, but I do.

As a transgender girl (7 months in HRT) I arrived to the conclusion that I had to be alone, atleast for a while, that I needed to be more myself, more Alicia, to meet someone and feel it right. As a man I've had a couple of partners but I always felt as an impostor.

So, one day I just send a chat recuest to that girl that I found really pretty, its a common thing in me, I just want to say that I found the evolution incredible and that she is really pretty, sometimes my chat request didn't get and answer, sometimes it does. So that time she wrote me back

We start talking and we found that we are from the same country, spain, just that 600km apart (in this small country its like from one side to the other) but idk why, she really get into me, so i went with all in, I told her that I've taken flights for dumper things, that she had someone and I wanted to know her better.

She was just like me, we share the same teenager years, the same memories and feelings, because she was trans like me, there was things I didn't need to epress, because she felt the same way. So the things escalated pretty quickly, and I start to like her, Even, after just a week, I bought a ticket to see her.

For me, it was the first time someone saw me as Alicia, that someone flirted with me as a girl, and made me feel desired as myself, and she made me fall of my horse, to be honest

But the thing is that one night, after our usuall voice chat talking about the time ill be there, she didnt answer me back, and the next day in the morning she didn't tell me anything. I had worked almost all night so I was really tired, but I was nervous about that. In the end she told me that she meet someone in the night, no, we didn't have ""anything"", but it hit me really hard, because I just wanted to see her and I felt like, ""I meet someone, I don't need you anymore"" (she never told that, but thats how I felt) so I told things that im not proud of, that I felt used and left behind, and I didn't let her answer me back.

In the end? She moved forward, after what I said she forgot about me, and that other girls wanted to see her again, and she said yes. We were really separated, and there was nothing real between us, even we have met for just like, 15 days maybe? but I really wanted to meet her, to see her, and to kiss her

Im trying to move forward too, I've found that other ppl found me pretty too, but I keep thinking about her, she made me feel special, desired, she made me feel Alicia, and it just breaks my heart that she have forgiven me and that Ill never be able to put her hair behid his ear and kiss her in the nose.

In the end she told me that she meet someone in the night, no, we didn\'t have ""anything"", but it hit me really hard, because I just wanted to see her and I felt like, ""I meet someone, I don\'t need you anymore"" (she never told that, but thats how I felt) so I told things that im not proud of, that I felt used and left behind, and I didn\'t let her answer me back.\n\nIn the end? She moved forward, after what I said she forgot about me, and that other girls wanted to see her again, and she said yes. We were really separated, and there was nothing real between us, even we have met for just like, 15 days maybe? but I really wanted to meet her, to see her, and to kiss her\n\nIm trying to move forward too, I\'ve found that other ppl found me pretty too, but I keep thinking about her, she made me feel special, desired, she made me feel Alicia, and it just breaks my heart that she have forgiven me and that Ill never be able to put her hair behid his ear and kiss her in the nose.\n\nI\'ll met someone, ill fall in love and everyting, but for me it was just like the first crush of a teenager, I don\'t think I\'ll ever forget her, even that she had already forget me.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My first crush since transition', 'created': 1584652294.0}"

2020-03-20 00:00:53,flkrv5,0,2,"I’m a grad student doing a study for my Sociolinguistics class at West Virginia University and am looking for participants all genders to participate in a study on how language/discourse helps construct gender identity. I will be analyzing online conversational discourse to see how it helps construct gender identity. Right now I especially need participants who are AMAB and identify as non-binary if you can please participate. 

You will just need to have a short conversation with me over reddit or something on any topic(s). Alternatively, if you don’t feel like talking with me, just email me screenshots of a conversation you had with literally anyone on any topic, as long as it is sufficiently long and is an actual conversation not just back and forth responses to questions. Ideally around 40+ messages on your part of the conversation. I would really prefer you talk to me though. 

I will definitely not let your name or anything be known (participants will be designated by pseudonyms, you may specify what you would like your pseudonym to be so that it can match your identity!) and any conversation I use will be deleted once I record the data. 

The institution is West Virginia University and the sponsoring professor is Sergio Robles Puente; his email is seroblespuente@mix.wvu.edu. Below is the prompt for the informed consent form, just copy it and type your name and then copy that and send it to me. (You don’t have to use your real name just use your reddit username if you want) 

I will treat you with respect and dignity and that one reason the study is being done is because there is not enough research on the relationship between discourse and identity in the LGBTQ+ community and I would like to add to the literature in that regards, as linguistics has primarily focused on cis straight people. 

Thank you for reading, and I would love for you to participate in this study. 

Much love ❤️

Please PM me!  🙂

I’ll answer you all as soon as possible!

PS: Mods, I may have posted a version of this here months ago but the deadline is approaching and I have changed the prompt and still need participants!

2020-03-22 03:20:39,fmszuc,0,1,"The Corona virus has given me too much time to think about the book I'll never finish planning to write about this studious bland girl with a secret obsession about becoming her twin who has spent the majority of his life in or on the run from mental health facilities. She starts trying to look as much like him as she can and one night they find each other in a small patch of trees and one of them ends up dead. The living one finds themselves in an odd position. They need to be the girl to live without being on the run but they find it had to reconcile the line of reasoning that keeps them safe with their disdain for how they were previously known all the while dealing with the delusions that either came from birth or years of obsessive thought preventing even themselves from knowing the truth.The book opens with a beaten and concussed teenager waking up to being tested first by being asked their name they reply with the masculine name knowing that is the right answer regardless of who they are. Talk of likes and dislikes lead them to a sticky situation that caused them to suspect that neither of them got all that much attention despite the level of expectation on them. Reminder s of the biological differences between boys and girls were brought up and made their parents increasingly irritated until the mother told everyone that her son was very ill and that has was ""not a real boy."" After a few weeks, the questions slow and they feel as if the most likely option was that they were, in fact, neither of the two. They could not stand living as they were told they used to but found the idea that they could even imagine an idea of stealing a person's life despicable but the limbo only lasted as long as the time between alternating accusations of murdering her last good daughter and apologies and promises that she could fix them from their mother where they could only effectively argue of them most likely not being one twin but could not argue convincingly against both sides.It became a habit to occupy one state of mind in one context and another in a different context. Summer was coming to an end and people seemed intentionally avoidant about the plan for school, but when it occasionally did come to be time to think about what will happen when school starts it was always a momentary exchange about how they are really the boy and they could not possibly handle the workload of such an intelligent young lady, finishing on a comment about how they had a lot of confidence killing such a beloved person and replacing her with such garbage. They would try to convince their parents to the contrary but the conversation would always flip. They would be accused of being the girl all along and then remind how much this whole charade was going to cost everyone close to them especially their siblings because the people who were truly close to them would be able to find the pleasant girl underneath to everyone else it would be seen as an extremely damaging relationship.Most of this didn't worry them. They didn't care for their family so the suggestion that they were hurting their family meant nothing and how they did in school was their life and their grades were a matter between them and their teachers. That was the real thing they worried about. They knew their teacher would put on a smile no matter if they came back the angelic little girl or small sharp shards of broken boy and welcome them back all the same. He knew they were going to teach him without letting him know how far off he was from the good student he destroyed. They couldn't them him that they didn't believe for a second that he was the girl he claimed to have come from and that he deserved to rot in a hospital. They would treat him with unparalleled levels of kindness and for that, he felt tremendously guilty.School does start and it is about how he planned with the exception that along with hiding their dislike for him they also treated the whole gracefully as if everything were fine. He went by his brother's name and looked like him but he was still the student he always was and none of this was given a second thought by his teacher, at least not in a way he ever could see. This meant he could enjoy moments pretending that everything was okay, that his teachers were okay and that school was just the place to learn things that felt very familiar to him. This wouldn't last long though because he would get the nervous episodes that the brother got where it was all to clear to him how much of a mess he was to interact with. Everyone he talked to he expected a show from and that everyone was just fearful enough to do it and it meant he then put the teacher in a place of dealing with the mental issues of a kid obviously pretending that they are something they are not. They would be sent to the counselor's office who they could care less about so it didn't matter so much anymore or that she was just tired of pretending to be the nutty brother and wanted to get back to class.He narrowly avoided the car crash that would be conferences where his teachers would realize that his parents didn't care at all if his teachers openly despised him and now they would be able to finally express their pent-up hatred. As much as he hated burdening his teachers he appreciated so much the moments of respite the school gave him and he didn't want to give that up. The school year eventually passed and during the summer some suicidal ideation came out of the woodwork. This could make or break his whole life because he knew that if he got sent to a mental health facility he would never leave. In the summer it was enough to stay out of sight but the next school year would be a different story.He started his senior year of high school. He had, for the most part, ran out of upper-level math and science classes so he started having teachers he never had before. One of them, his sociology teacher demonstrated such a care and understanding for so many that often went about forgotten and despised. This attitude didn't stop with him either. He seemed perfectly happy to entertain whatever delusion he was partial to that day. When he would start to freak out he would understand only as what he was told. If he asked his student how they were doing and they responded with, ""I don't know"" that was only as much of a cause for alarm as the student would make of it. All of this consideration seemed hard to inspire with fear, or maybe the nicest teacher he had ever met was more scared than he could even imagine. He would stay in his teacher's room from as early as he could be let in to as late as the teacher stay. The teacher would from time to time hint that it was okay for him to stay after he had left but he knew to be who knows where until 6 pm was not a good look coming home.One of these afternoons the teacher returned from a meeting to find him Frozen in a corner hyperventilating, which wasn't unusual for him, but what was unusual was the studdering words with the cadence of an apology. The teacher helped him catch his breath and express the guilt he had for torturing the teacher for every drop of kindness he could get. The teacher explained that he found no intrinsic dislike for him and that he did not see that as the case for the other teachers as well. He talked about how he was impressed by the student's ability to handle the unusual situation so productively. Then they talked about the expectations of assertiveness for teachers when they feel there is a problem and what to look for when it comes to more subtle expressions of disapproval. This finished with a reminder in the utility of being more responsive to explicit displays of opinion and to trust that others will express themselves.He grew immensely attached to this teacher and after graduation still find off days in college to sneak into the teacher's classes. In college, it was hard to reconcile the fear he had held for so long with how little his peers cared the focus was not which one of the twins was he. They only knew him now and never met his twin the information would do them no good. The excitement came with the idea that he had killed another person he and his twin were not all that difficult to kill and he was confident in not having the intention to do so and that kept him unimpressed but everyone still felt it interesting.

2020-03-22 14:36:16,fn0tb2,1,1,"TL;DR at the bottom

Im an afab questioning gender, and I'm sorry if the title is confusing. I kind of dont know where to post this.

* Basically, I would love to be a dude. I've fantasized about it a lot, and I had these feelings somewhere at the start of September but they became severe somewhere in the start of this year. I can't stand having wide hips and breasts. I've cut off my long hair and even started shopping in the male section. I've had breakdowns over me being a girl and I thought about suicide when I think that I'll never be a cis dude.
* However, sometimes I like being a girl, but its mostly thoughts of ""huh. this isnt so bad"", These thoughts are rare though. One of the most recent times where I felt okay with being a girl was when I was dressing up for my boyfriend and I was proud of my body because I felt that my feminine features were attractive (such as wide hips and chest).
* I know that I don't have to get top or bottom surgery if I don't want to, but I feel if I don't, I'll never be a ""complete"" dude, so I want to either transition all the way or not at all. 
* Here is the problem of transitioning - I don't want to have a 'fake' dick (a dick that can't ejaculate, and there are complications that may come with bottom surgery). I have healthy functioning genitals and I dont want to sacrifice that for something that may come with huge complications.
* I want to be referred by he/him but I feel like I dont deserve these pronouns because I don't pass. 
* A gender therapist isn't an option, I live in a homophobic and transphobic country where we don't have free speech (UAE, Dubai). Its very hard to get a proper psychiatrist
* Lastly, I want to mention that I know I dont have to make a choice right now, but I need to do something because this is fucking torture.

**TL;DR:** I want to be a cis boy so bad, that I would have breakdowns over it, but sometimes I'm okay with being a girl, but thats when I dress up for my boyfriend and I sometimes like my feminine features, due to the fact that my boyfriend likes them, and its very rare that these feelings of being okay occur. I have cut my hair short and I buy stuff from the male department, but I'm questioning if I'm simply a masculine girl or a trans dude. I want to either go all the way with the transition, or not at all. However, I don't want to sacrifice my healthy organs for a 'fake' dick. I know I don't have to transition or do anything, but its torture and I want to do something about it. A gender therapist is not an option.

I'm just looking for some new perspectives on my situation. I know that I have to go to a therapist, and I know that reddit wont solve my problems, I just want to hear some opinions.

I’m turning 24 in two days and I’ve been setting a bunch of personal goals and objectives for what I’m hoping to get out of my 24th trip around the sun. One of those things is to to get a new therapist and talk to them about my questionable gender identity so here’s some background on me. I was born male and have lived my entire life as a male although I’ve been interested in things deemed feminine since before I was a teenager but I never let it show. I played male associated sports since I was five all the way through my junior year of high school including but not limited to Football, kickboxing and wrestling. After high school I was planning to go to college but after some personal relationship issues I decided I’d try my hand at the military so I joined the Marine Corps. Now don’t get me wrong I loved playing sports and I loved my time in military. I had fun and met a lot of great friends but I never felt like it was the true me. I had fun and enjoyed it but at the same time felt like I was putting on an act so that people would view me as manly. To be honest 80% of the reason I chose the corps over the other branches is because it in my eyes was considered the toughest and most hardcore and I wanted people to feel that way about me. Ok that’s enough of my precious masculinity now I want to talk about the real stuff, my feminine side. Now as a very young child I had almost no feminine side because I spent most of my time with my dad who was a masculine college athlete and my three brothers who were all also athletes. But around age ten or so I started to notice my interests changing, I liked “girly” shows and movies, I was more emotional than most of the other guys, and the big one that hit me for years was I was OBSESSED with female fashion. At 13 while most boys were hiding porn on their laptops I was hiding fashion blogs and whatnot. Also when I was 13 I started dating a girl whom I would later grow to love. She was the only one I was ever myself around. I wasn’t like toxically masculine but at school or around male friends I put on a persona of toughness and tact. But with Claire I was carefree and myself. Now I’d had this feminine side for a while but it wasn’t until I was about 17 that I started to seriously wish I was born a girl and think about how much happier my life would be if that had happened. These thoughts persisted for a while then for personal reasons I joined marines and suppressed them my best. Then I got injured and spent my time focusing on that and other issues but in the back of my mind it’s always been there. That was a couple years ago and that feeling of wanting to be feminine has only grown especially in this quarantine. I’ve spent countless hours this past week watching makeup tutorials and practicing them on myself, browsing women’s shopping websites for clothes and adding them to my cart (still haven’t worked up courage to buy yet). I honestly don’t know what advice I’m looking for and don’t have a specific question I just don’t know what to do. Like I said at the beginning I’m planning to get a new therapist that I can talk to about this but I wanted advice from people who’ve gone through the change themselves. Are there things I need to do or ask myself before looking further? Is there any books or blogs I should read up on? I’m gunna worry about how to explain this to friends and family later if I do go through with it but right now I’m just focused on how to deal with these thoughts myself.

Pretty much as soon as I hit puberty, I've been fascinated with the idea of being biologically, socially, and sexually female.  I don't recall a day in recent (or distant, for that matter) memory where I *haven't* thought about it.  Not even when I realized that I had messed up my college education so badly that I would have to drop, not when I lost my job that I enjoyed, and not even when my mother died.  Each of those days, I still had very ""eggy"" thoughts about how I wished I was a girl.  For the record, I'm AMAB, and more than likely mtf transgender.

I don't think this is going to gain any traction, truly. I'm more writing this for my own catharsis for what's probably a pretty horrible realization.  As much as I want to be a girl, I don't think I ever will be.

I'm one of the lucky ones.  I don't experience a lot of dysphoria.  Sometimes I feel like I want to chop my shoulders off for being too broad, and I don't like the hair on my body, but I don't mind having a penis.  I don't grow viscerally disgusted with myself, and I'm sorry that some of you do.  I can't imagine what that's like.

But what I can imagine is the horrible way that this world treats transgender and non-binary individuals. I've been friends with a few in the past that frankly were larger deterrents to mine own coming out than anything.  It wasn't their fault, but the sheer disdain that they received from people in their everyday lives was enough to make me never want to transition.

I want to clarify something.  I don't care what people think of me.  I'm bisexual and in a male x male presenting relationship, and display my affection with my boyfriend openly.  I love him very much, and we occasionally get some side-eye.  But it's come within the public consciousness of our region that to treat someone rudely for being gay is not accepted, and I'm so very thankful for that.  

It just simply doesn't apply to those who don't identify as cisgendered.  And I'm not sure it ever will.  Not within my lifetime, I don't think.  Transgendered people are *treated* differently. Outwardly and openly.  And to be treated like scum on a daily basis isn't in the cards for me.

You can say as much as you want to surround myself with people who care, but the fact of the matter is that it's not yet my time.  Call me weak, if you'd like.  

I apologize if this isn't the sort of content we'd like to facilitate here, on the off-chance this does pick up any amount of steam.  But again, I'm writing this for my own catharsis.  

If ever a time comes in the world where I think I could be a woman, and even most people wouldn't treat me like the grime you'd find underneath a toilet seat, I might just try and do it.

Fun fact: in Great Britain you can be arrested for calling someone the wrong gender.

I am not transphobic, I have issues with the etymology of the terms that the trans community uses.

""heteronormative"" ""cis"" like who comes up with these words? Just use NORMAL WORDS. I'm far from stupid but some bad apples intentionally throw terms like these around to confuse, blame, and make others out to be the bad people for not knowing them.

This kind of thing is exceptionally prevalent on image boards where people can be banned from or exiled without question, where the moderators and admins can label someone as a transphobe for no good reason and turn the community against them.

I don't care what gender you identify as. You do you, have fun with it. I *do* care about the proper usage of language to describe yourself.

Why are you calling the police?\n\nFun fact: in Great Britain you can be arrested for calling someone the wrong gender.\n\nI am not transphobic, I have issues with the etymology of the terms that the trans community uses.\n\n""heteronormative"" ""cis"" like who comes up with these words? Just use NORMAL WORDS. I\'m far from stupid but some bad apples intentionally throw terms like these around to confuse, blame, and make others out to be the bad people for not knowing them.\n\nThis kind of thing is exceptionally prevalent on image boards where people can be banned from or exiled without question, where the moderators and admins can label someone as a transphobe for no good reason and turn the community against them.\n\nI don\'t care what gender you identify as. You do you, have fun with it. I *do* care about the proper usage of language to describe yourself. Because if you use the wrong word, and SOMEONE CORRECTS YOU, you can\'t just label them a transphobe for correcting your own mistake.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""What's with the extremely cringe gatekeeping from some bad apples?"", 'created': 1585061236.0}"

Regardless of whether it's another one of our monumental mistakes or someone else's inability to be Human, the pain feels the same... Overwhelming! 
There are countless sayings and quotes to hopefully lessen the sting and inspire renewed hope. They are admittedly necessary at times and yet, inevitably lacking. I truly wish I had the thought beyond thought that would allow me to provide the answers so many of us are desperately seeking. Sadly, if you look to the side, you'll see me in a similar situation.
Lost opportunities, lost loves, lost innocence... For some of us it becomes difficult to even remember what brought us This Close to the Point Of No Return.
I cannot speak for others but, when the temperature of my life reaches Red line, when I can literally feel the crevices and spaces behind my eyes filling with all the rising crap that I've swallowed, when I finally realize no matter who's support I might have, the choice to survive is Mine to make...I pause. I breathe. I force myself through the storm to the calm at it's center. Each time, what I find in that calm is Myself. Not the facade I present to the world for the sake of fitting in and avoiding conflict. Not the alter ego that allows me to pretend to be confident and carefree. I find the essence of who I am, the essence that knows how much better I want to be, the essence that accepts All that it is made of and knows that none of it belongs in the current mess!
This doesn't magically solve my problems. I have neither a red, nor blue pill. I have exactly what I found in the calm of the storm's eye... Me. I recognize my horrible predicament as simply ""the worst thing that's happen, since the last worst thing that happened"". I am no rod of steel but, neither am I a blade of grass to be cut down and tossed aside. I accept my situation and all the bullshit that comes with it.

2) Is it possible to “go back” to my original gender. If so are there any permanent negative consequences.

4) (mostly for the UK) what support is out there for this stuff

5) Is it possible to completely transition from one gender to another. Could you tell the difference between a person who has transitioned into being a girl and a person who was born a girl.

Let’s start off with a trigger warning. Proceed with caution.


When I was born my parents were SO excited to have a little baby girl. Pink was everything. I was surrounded by it. To be honest, I can’t blame them. I was their first daughter. I just wish I fought back. For years I spent every night crying wishing and begging I would wake up as a boy, and yet I said nothing. I locked myself in my bedroom all the time at the ripe old age of 7 because I wasn’t comfortable being seen. I spent my childhood crying in my room and pretending to be happy in front of my parents. I would happily accept my Christmas presents watching my parents faces to see if I was putting up a good enough act and then cry in my room because I didnt want any of this pink “stuff.”

I regret my childhood.

Now, my parents REFUSE to use the proper name and pronouns because “we didn’t see any signs when you were a kid.” 

This is the third time I’ve came out as trans. The first time I was 10 (barely knowing the word). The second time I was 13 (knowing this is who I was). And now the third time about a month ago (ready to fight tooth and nail no matter who disagrees). Yet they still don’t have enough proof. Calling it a phase and fighting with the doctors that there’s “no way ‘she’ can be trans”.

Im ready to fight until my death to be called by MY NAME. I will be who I am and I will not be buried in a grave that is not mine. Sorry.

And maybe hear something other than what I usually hear on trans women in women's sports. What I've consistently heard is that it's not a fair competition and it shouldn't be allowed, the biological differences are too great to make it a fair competition and the results of trans women competing in women's sports (particularly combat sports) speaks for itself.

I have always felt something about me and my sexuality was, off, in some way I could not really put words on. My friends thought I was gay because I turned down sex with girls from the age of 15. My family thought the same because I never had a girlfriend until I was 20. A large part of my life I have half jokingly stated that I'm a gay woman in a man's body without really giving it a deeper thought. 

For most of my life I've had an alternative style, goth, wich was always very feminine. It made me feel nice and I enjoyed the attention from men and women alike. But more than anything it made me comfortable in my own skin. 

I have always been quite feminine and for some time I entertained the idea that i might be gay. I slept with a guy and even though it was a nice experience it still didn't feel quite right. It made me more confused in a sense. If that wasnt it, what the hell is? I've slept with alot of women and something wasn't quite right there either. I was never comfortable with playing the role that was expected of me. 

Something happened when I met my wife and we had children. There was not enough time anymore to maintain my style. For the first time in my adult life i started to look like a ""man"". It threw me into a identity crisis I could not understand. I believe that it could be dysphoria. My wife is a wonderful person and with her I could finally explore all these confusing things. For the first time in my life I could have sex and feel comfortable. I also found you guys and slowly the pieces started to fall into place. 

Thing is. I don't know if I qualify. Do I want to be a woman? Yes.
If I could press a button and become one, would I? Yes. 
Will I do something about it? No. 

Realizing that this might be the case, that I am trans, has been both an incredible sorrow and a huge relief. 

I feel so incredibly heartbroken that I will never be, what i was born to be. 
I feel relieved that I now have some understanding as to why I was always so uncomfortable. 

My wife is my best friend and such incredible support. Being able to be completely open and honest about this made everything feel much better and bearable.

I do still have a type with transgender girls but I don’t know where to look any help with that? Or maybe this is a stage but I’m just a bit lost and btw I’m not attracted to guys at all (don’t have anything against men on men love) but just not my cup of tea.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Im 17M and looking for help and answears!

2020-03-28 22:36:46,fqu9gq,0,2,"This isn't super cheerful btw just a heads up

I'm an ftm teen (15) but I also have autism. 

I've had therapy for around a year now because of an od last year and I've had 3 therapists because of reasons outside my control. When I got referred to my third therapist I was also given less intense therapy you could say because it was a group instead of 1:1 meaning they believe my risk has gone down.

I had never told a therapist about issues with my gender before because my first had basically no confidentiality and would pass anything and everything over to my mum, and I only had my second one for 3 sessions overall. When I told my therapist her response was that autistic people become fixated about things and I had to be ""fluid about it."" She also said that teenagers are very indecisive and want everything at an exact moment. 

I have no idea how to feel about it (this was the end of 2019 btw, coronavirus has basically stopped my sessions for now) and it's beginning to really take a toll on me. I've had to lie to her for her to not just tell me I'm being fixated about it and the more I think about it the more I think it's more what she said and not me. I understand that coming out is something with weight that changes how you're seen and as a result I took the time to think about it say it out loud, for my therapist to go ahead and say that, to the point where I'm not lying about not being sure so that she doesn't call me obsessed?

It's also taken a toll on my daily life because she helped me to tell my mum during that session as well, which means my mum has that mentality too and won't stop dead naming me so I have no idea what to do. Especially being at home everyday and being dead named 24/7 even when I've tried to bring it up with her.

Honestly I feel worse now and part of me just wishes I never came out at all, because now I'm just being blatantly ignored.

When I got referred to my third therapist I was also given less intense therapy you could say because it was a group instead of 1:1 meaning they believe my risk has gone down.\n\nI had never told a therapist about issues with my gender before because my first had basically no confidentiality and would pass anything and everything over to my mum, and I only had my second one for 3 sessions overall. When I told my therapist her response was that autistic people become fixated about things and I had to be ""fluid about it."" She also said that teenagers are very indecisive and want everything at an exact moment. \n\nI have no idea how to feel about it (this was the end of 2019 btw, coronavirus has basically stopped my sessions for now) and it\'s beginning to really take a toll on me. I\'ve had to lie to her for her to not just tell me I\'m being fixated about it and the more I think about it the more I think it\'s more what she said and not me. I understand that coming out is something with weight that changes how you\'re seen and as a result I took the time to think about it say it out loud, for my therapist to go ahead and say that, to the point where I\'m not lying about not being sure so that she doesn\'t call me obsessed?\n\nIt\'s also taken a toll on my daily life because she helped me to tell my mum during that session as well, which means my mum has that mentality too and won\'t stop dead naming me so I have no idea what to do. Especially being at home everyday and being dead named 24/7 even when I\'ve tried to bring it up with her.\n\nHonestly I feel worse now and part of me just wishes I never came out at all, because now I\'m just being blatantly ignored.\n\nI don\'t know if anyone has any advice?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read btw', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Therapist', 'created': 1585460206.0}"

I hope your all doing well and enjoying yourself in quarantine.

Today I admitted to by best friend that I was having some gender identity problems in my life, the first person that u have spoken to about it, she was very supportive and didn't give me any bad advice, just saying our opinions of you wont change and told me to not to rush myself and really think about all this before anything else.

I did feel like a burden was lifted of my chest when I said it and I was so scared but just decided to press send on the message as there was no going back after that.

I'm now going through my mind and seeing what's what and also noticed some things that made me uncomfortable when said but maybe hadn't noticed it repressed it.

So I understand what OP means I think, as I feel the same sexual attraction for some transgender women (and don't get me wrong, the few I know are wonderful women for a lot of other reasons too), but strictly sexually speaking, I am also curious as to how to say this politely, because a lot of terms feel/are derogatory.

One of the trans women I know is a sex worker, so I asked her and she said that would be being into ""t-girls"". 

Obviously everyone  has different bodies and transistions in different ways and to different extents, so I can see how this would be offensive. I'm not trying to fetishize. It takes a lot for me to be into anyone enough that I want to sleep with them. But I couldn't really think of a polite way to specify that a woman with a penis was a wonderful sexual experience for me and that would probably be my hope for my imaginary ideal partner.

I (30M) LOVE dating and hooking up with attractive (for my taste) trans women. What started as a curious experiment (that I've longed for since I was 14) has turned into somewhat of a preference. Even though I date both cis and trans women, I now prefer trans women for dating or hooking up.

With that being said, I'm afraid that I've turned into a chaser, which I hate. I'm always trying to be respectful and chivalrous with the ladies I date and cherish an actual connection.

Everyday when I'm at home I have to either choose to have my breast hanging, moving when I walk and looking inappropriate even under a shirt or having my shoulders or back hurting because of a bra.

Also, I had to ask for blood tests instead of an Interest on his part to keep them checked. Still waiting on my last results actually...

2020-03-29 19:38:35,frbt0q,2,2,"Okay let's begin
I'm a girl but i wore boy's clothes when i was 4 years old
(Lasted 2 years) Because i got lice and my family gave me male clothes so people don't get confused on why a bald boy is wearing girl's clothes. I don't remember my childhood, when i ask my family about it, they told me i loved a shirt that resembled a famous football player and barely changed it (also barely showered :D), i saw a picture of my cousin and me wearing a soldier's clothes and smiling ear to ear (i smile too much..... I also cry easily.... I have mental issues :I ) however, i never had any issues with my body but i would always get annoyed at things such as they tell me on how i should behave and talk more feminine
On third year of my high school, i got bullied because of being a teacher's pet (i had great grades) and also a nerd (there were two teachers who hated me, the reason for it..... Another time!) I started getting depressed, my grades were bad, i was hot tempered and easily cried..... I also started to notice boys clothes....
When i went shopping with my family, they would start choosing girls clothes for me (because i had horrible taste, according to my sisters), so i would look at boys section and sigh at how attractive the clothes were. How it was unfair that i could barely find long sleeve clothes with finger holes at girls section and how cool and attractive boys clothes were.
On my last year of high school, my family and i traveled to a coastal town (the prices were cheap and it had a great beach) so next day we decided to go shopping, my sisters (i'm youngest of three) were lazy and it was morning so they wore simple make up but i were lazier so i didn't (plus my face were puffy because i.am.not.a.morning.person) so i wore a hoodie and covered my head with-the-hoodie and went shopping. While we were shopping, a mother and two girls saw me and whispered (not too quite)
""is she a girl or..."" And after hearing that i....... PANICKED. I felt scared. For myself and my family. I thought ' what if they heard' so i started to ask my mother 'mom is this shirt cute?' In a slightly more feminine voice
when i think about it now, why would i get scared and why would i care if my family heard it or not.
I'm in my second year of university now and i'm confused about my gender
I don't have any dysphoria towards any part of my body except my vigina.... I mean i get disgusted and scared when i look at it (well the first time happened in high school when my friend told her friend that she found out what type of vigina she had so i got curious and looked at my vigina with mirror and i got extremely uncomfortable at seeing it)
When i'm seeing transgender topics or youtube videos, i get this mixed feeling of sadness and nervousness but when I'm not doing that and just having fun or just laying around, i just feel normal
Me and my sisters have nicknames for each other.
I call them little witch and little wild (don't judge... there are affectionate nicknames)
One of my sisters calls me little boy for about 6 or 7 months and i don't get offended or correct her (my other nickname is monkey). Deep inside i get this mixed feeling of happiness and extreme nervousness when she calls me that.

2020-03-30 04:16:15,frk2gm,3,1,"TL;DR at the bottom

So a little background about me: for the past year and a half or so, I had identified as genderfluid (I’m AMAB) and for most of that time had been exploring my gender both at home with my wife (she’s super supportive), and in therapy with a fantastic therapist who has experience working with gender non-conforming people. Then at the end of January/beginning of February, I had a series of experiences related to gender that culminated with a week of the worst dysphoria I had ever had followed by a wonderfully euphoric weekend spent as a woman and lead me to realize that I actually am a transwoman and not genderfluid. 

So for the past month and a half, I’ve been lurking on this sub, embracing my feminine side more entirely, discussing my experience with my wife (still incredibly supportive) and therapist, and more or less just becoming more and more confident that I am actually trans. I even came out to a small, select group of close friends who have been wonderfully accepting and supporting of me (a fact for which I count myself truly lucky).

The thing is, due to several factors including not being out to my family and coronavirus induced social isolation, I am pretty much unable to take any significant steps toward further transitioning, either medically or even really socially. But I want to SO BAD! I want to change my name, get on HRT, be out publicly and live as my authentic self not just in the privacy of my own home. And I want to do it all yesterday! But due to my current circumstances (and admittedly my own anxiety), those things won’t be an option to me for a while yet. So what can I do to mitigate these feelings of impatience? Do I just have to suck it up and deal with it until I’m able to start my transition in earnest? Or is there a trick to make the waiting for it less frustrating/agonizing? I appreciate any advice y’all might have on this.

I was born a female, but I don't feel okay with having parts like vagina and boobs. I just don't feel good like this, nor do I like having long hair. 8t doesn't make me feel fullfilled.

Tell me, what does kne need to know about being a guy? Like How does one wash themselves etc.

I don't  wish to be a masculine male, but I would rather be a feminine boy.

 I didn't tell anyone yet, I am not ready. This could very much be just momentary. I will definetly reconsider enough to make the right choice.

I also want to ask about the surgery part, because that's the main part of my trans identity. I think getting rid of boobs to get a smaller chest is not as difficult, but I researched the female to male genitalia conversion and found it has lesser success. If anyone here has had a surgery like that, please tell me about your experience.
