I‚Äôm sure most (if not all) of us have gone through craaaazzzyyyy periods of dysphoria. TL;DR I‚Äôve been on hormones since August of 2017 coming up on three years!). I have legally changed my name and am lucky enough to live full time. Lately my dysphoria has gotten so bad that most days I find myself hiding out in my apartment, so I decided to start looking in to surgical options. I found a cheap breast augmentation that includes body contouring in South Africa. My friend has offered to let me stay at her place to recover and everything. So with the costs of the surgery, anesthesia, travel, etc I need about $10,000. I‚Äôm currently in the process of selling all of my designer items but I‚Äôve also created a gofundme page. If you have the means necessary. Would you be able to donate or help to spread the word? I hate asking but my dysphoria is making this feel really desperate.

Smells like fish jokes, roast beef flaps jokes, loose vagina jokes.

The detrans subreddit is filled with gender-critical people who don't really have the intention of helping confused people or letting them explore their options.

I realised recently that my ignorance towards other races (ngl, I learned I was looking at things very poorly due to lack of perspective), might translate to be transphobic or homophobic. My friend, who is also a white man (from the same country and general upbringing, hooray for diversity), and we decided to tackle some of these issues we figured we were so right on.

That leads me to where I am right now, before continuing I would like to say, I fully accept that anybody should be able to do whatever they want to their body so long as they are aware of the consequences (like a drug addict knowing what they are doing to themselves) and aren't hurting anybody else.

My question is, why do people opt to have a sex-change? I ask this because I feel as if *nobody* should feel wrong when they take a look at themselves in the mirror. Based on my intuition (which I am entirely open to being wrong about), I figured transgender people probably feel like they don't belong to the gender they were born as, which leads to opting for a sex-change. 


I fully agree that, as a society, we should be more accepting of people's decisions to do what they want to themselves, **but isn't the correct idea to destroy the insecurity that people face which causes a want to change?** Being born a boy or a girl shouldn't mean you have to live your life a certain way, you shouldn't have to think you're born ""wrong"".

The thought of a child calling me ‚ÄúMom‚Äù scares me because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve earned it, I‚Äôve lived life acting as a man for so long that I‚Äôm not sure where the line between acting and authenticity would be.  I don‚Äôt feel like I could authentically be a mother role, let alone a grandmother role.  I guess I‚Äôm taking gender norms too seriously and filtering the idea of what a mother is through my own mother.  It‚Äôs scary thoughüò¨ then I wonder if maybe cis women have this fear too, same with cis men, trans men, etc.  Becoming a parent in general can be terrifying and prone to imposter syndrome.  Transitioning in general is prone to imposter syndrome in the process of learning.  Nobody really knows what they‚Äôre doing, all that matters is the love for the child.  All that matters in being a woman is being authentic.  What do you think?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Feeling fake', 'created': 1591567512.0}"

I am here to better understand things that I might be ignorant of in light of J. K Rowlings tweet. Please forgive me if I don't word something correctly. 

I am a I think what you call a cis woman. I grew up in a country where I was never exposed to any different forms of sexuality and gender other than the traditional.

I only learned about homosexuality after high school. I now live in a society where there is a variety of everything. I always stood on the grounds that everyone deserves to be happy and to live how they want but that is not enough.

When I was scrolling through Rowlings tweet replies I realized that I needed to understand more than just ""everyone deserves to be happy"" because I seemed to fall in the middle. I agreed with some points on both sides of the argument.

I understand being trans is being born in the wrong body (again forgive me if I don't word things correctly). I always felt that if someone feels they are a woman then they are a woman. I respect the courage to go against the grain and I figured no one did that for shits and giggles because it pretty much upends your whole life.

I can see where she was wrong because not all women menstruate. The point that I found I kind of agreed with is that there can be grey areas that will erode womens rights if we just have this fluidity. Now that I think about it, it can be good for women in terms of equality.

Set me straight if my line of thinking is wrong. Explain it to me like I am 2 years old.

Things to talk about w/ therapist.

Extreme anxiety interferes with everyday life

1. Literally sitting for hours missing appointments and deadlines out of fear of getting up and being the center of attention. (DMV SCENARIO, appt @3:45, sat until 5:30 pondering how I‚Äôm gonna get up discreetly and ask for help)
2. Having issues finding a job, bcuz of fear of discrimination... first few times I tried I got discriminated against very OPENLY... (KFC, TARGET, ROSS) stopped me from trying to pursue new positions. Despite me needing a source of income for support
3. finding myself paralyzed w/ fear so I‚Äôll sit and do nothing instead.
4. Constantly looking in the mirror or phone reflection to assess how people are perceiving me almost obsessively in public. 
5. Trouble staying consistent w/ voice training despite it being a tremendous need. 
6. Wears the same clothes everyday bcuz I believe I won‚Äôt ‚Äúpass‚Äù in anything else.
7. Hearing negative voices or thinking I can hear what people are thinking about me (new symptom) 
8. Reverts back to masculine tendencies when other people are looking at me out of fear that they‚Äôre judging me (which in turn makes it WAY worse) 
9. Generally afraid to leave the house and do anything even when I have enough funds... out of fear of alienation and discrimination. This even includes grocery shopping, literally will sit in my car until 10 minutes before close to shop peacefully 
10. Stopped going through drive thrus, &amp; or eating out entirely bcuz of issues surrounding my voice and my appearance. 
11. When I‚Äôm driving I assume people can see me through their mirrors and switch lanes, and or speed up to avoid me.

2020-06-09 03:11:41,gzeqgl,2,4,"This a bit of a long rant but I need to get this shit off my chest...

From the time that I came out as trans last October until now, my MIL hasn't exactly been super understanding even after multiple discussions between my wife and her. However, she still mostly let's me wear what I want and has even given me some of her clothing at times. My FIL though is very much not understanding of the LGBT and doesn't care at all to try to understand. He just always says that everyone should just do what they want but that he's allowed to have his opinions (more on that later). Unfortunately, while living with her parents, there have been multiple occasions where I have worn a very modest dress or a night gown for bedtime and he has told my MIL that I make him uncomfortable because of it. He otherwise just keeps his mouth shut because ""he knows it'll start shit if he does.""

That was until today... We were all outside eating dinner and talking about the rioting and everything else going on. While my FIL was away, my wife brought up the recent police attack on a LGBT bar. This got us into a heated discussion with my MIL about the use of the word queer. We tried to explain about why people in the LGBT use it and that there is a reclaiming behind it. MIL wouldn't let up saying that if she or someone outside the LGBT ever used the word queer that they would be attacked for it. We kept trying to explain that it's all about context and how you use it - well she still fought us on it. She said ""What is that group anyway? The LGBNFVH?"" We replied that no it is the LGBT but some people have some variation thereof. 

FIL then gets back and asks what we're talking about so we fill him in. He then proceeds to tell us about the time he made fun of one of his friends at the mine for crossing through a pride parade to reach him across the street somewhere in the Florida Keys. I asked him what was so funny about someone being in a pride parade. He said nothing and that it's just not his thing. We keep talking about it and it gets to the point where my wife asks ""What about OP?"" to which he points at me and says ""HE can do whatever he wants."" We both immediately reply ""It's SHE""

We then got into an even bigger argument as we asked why he can't just use my pronouns. He jokes and says ""I don't even know what a pronoun is"" My wife retorts and he then says he has his beliefs and we have ours and that's all that matters. That's when I tell them ""I have never been a man, I am not a man now, and I will never be a man"". My wife adds after a moment of silence that we have a firm boundary agreed between the both of us that if they ever refer to me as our son's dad, that they will not be allowed to see him until they apologize and call me either his mom or his zaza. FIL asks what zaza even is so we explained that to him. MIL retorts ""Well we'll probably be dead and then you won't even have to worry about it"" I was so livid at that point from everything else that had been said that I let slip ""You said it, not me""

She was noticeably irritated by that and said well what about the fact that you keep calling him your son. I said our son is genetically male but that if he ever came out as trans, NB, or something else, that we would support him. She followed up with asking how they're gonna be the ones to mess our son up when we're gonna be confusing him with a complicated topic. My wife (I love her to bits) said ""Geometry is confusing but we teach kids that!"" I then (quoting some of the latest literature) said ""Yes I am genetically male and I will never be able to change that. However, everyone starts off with a female brain that runs on estrogen. Eventually in males the male chromosome takes over and switches the pathway to testosterone. In transwomen such as myself, that never happens so you become a woman trapped in a man's body"".

Well they still kept on fighting with us and acting like they were doing nothing wrong. We kept trying to point out that intentionally not using my proper pronouns is offensive and hurtful. My wife asked FIL  how he would like it if we just started misgendering him. He laughed and replied by saying that ""Honestly you'd see that it doesn't bother me at all."" My MIL was still on his side and kept saying that's just how things are in this area (small town Indiana). We said that people actually have been accepting except for them and that when we tell others about the stuff they say/do towards us, that they are on our side. MIL said that while they'll say stuff (like what's all written above) to our faces, other people are doing it behind our backs. Clearly things were going nowhere and we would have an easier time talking to a brick wall so we just got up and left as her brother pulled in the driveway to talk with MIL.",trans,Me (25 MtF - 3months HRT) and my wife (26 F) had a fight with her parents about the LGBT,1591697501.0,"{'created_utc': 1591672301, 'id': 'gzeqgl', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 4, 'selftext': 'This a bit of a long rant but I need to get this shit off my chest...\n\nFrom the time that I came out as trans last October until now, my MIL hasn\'t exactly been super understanding even after multiple discussions between my wife and her.

I'm a 15 year old male. I've decided to make this post because of something that I experienced recently. I should probably preface this with the fact that I am not a very emotional person. I rarely cry about anything, this is how it was for quite some time, at least a few years.

Recently I started looking into ways I could style my hair, and I looked into braiding. After coming across a guide to different braids (this specific one was for women) I started to get quite sad. Sad about the fact I would never be able to wear my hair like that. This sadness turned from just my hair to how I dress and the clothes that I wear, as well as just my general appearance. This led to me eventually breaking down into tears. This has been on the back of my mind ever since, due to how unusual it was for me.

This feeling happens quite a bit. It doesn't always result in crying but I could be looking at a picture of a woman, it could even be just a drawing of a fictional one. But I'll see this picture and sometimes I'll just feel sad. Sad that I'm not *that*. 

I also found a thought question (I'm pretty sure that's the term), about if you got turned into the other sex, would it bother you? I eventually decided that, no, it wouldn't bother me. I then expanded upon this idea, if I were given a pill, that should I take I would become the opposite sex, in a body that reflects that sex, would I take it. I decided that I am pretty certain I would. 

I feel as though this doesn't make me trans however. There are many things that I feel and think that I feel as though a trans person wouldn't feel, or think. 

I'm don't, for example, feel weird about being called a he, or a him. I'm not sure whether or not this is because I wouldn't want to be called anything else, or if this is because I am used to being called a he.

I also don't feel any bottom dysphoria. I don't mind the fact that I have a penis, although I wouldn't mind if I had a vagina either, I'm mostly indifferent to it.

The biggest thing however, is the fact when I think of myself in adulthood, I always see myself as a male, *always.* I sometimes have myself think as if I were a woman in adulthood, and it doesn't feel any better, it doesn't feel as though it fits anymore than if I were a man.

However, when I think of myself *in the present* as a woman, I feel as though it fits a little better, not by a substantial amount, but it still feels different, in a good way.

I don't want to come to any major conclusion to quickly. But I think some input from others would be useful when I do want to come to that conclusions.",trans,"Am I trans, or something else?",1591713643.0,"{'created_utc': 1591688443, 'id': 'gzig69', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 5, 'selftext': ""Throwaway as some of my family knows my account.\n\nI'm a 15 year old male.

My question is, would this actually make you feel validated in a weird way? That the ""I'm uncomfortable around men"" thing applies to you too now?

2020-06-09 22:06:57,gzxgdr,3,2,"Hey everyone!

I really need some advice on this, I'll write this in kind of a timeline so you get me progression mentally and I guess physically.


So I am someone (21Yo) in a male body, and haven't ever thought of myself to be the other gender.

I haven't really been a manly man, being a little bit more shy, and ""young/innocent"" (you know that kind of softer more gentle femme look) I haven't felt to be part of the ""boys"" for the most part, usually listening in to my friends rather than contributing to the masculinity of the talks and atmosphere.

When in my mid teens I was even against the idea of trans (I think differently now, and think you are all so brave and cool and amazing!)

I even grew a beard in my late teens (not a bad one either) looking back it may have been an attempt to be more masculine to try fit in somewhere.

Cut all the way to December last year, I wanted to explore the world of dressing up in girly clothes, so I bought some with the amazing support of my girlfriend.

This part call it phase 1, was more of a sexual release and exploration, I felt euphoric and literally out of this world, just putting my girly clothes on.

Phase 2!
I become more and more curious over the beginning of the year, buying quite a few girly outfits to try on and wear when it was just me and my girlfriend around (I live in a flat shared with my best friend)

Phase 3!
I dress as frequently as I can without coming out as I can as I felt that it made me so much happier (I have the big anxiety and depression D:) I just felt like a different person, and it felt good!

Phase 4!
I try some makeup on and I love it (I started practicing when I get the time), started shaving somewhat regularly, I also shaved my beard off (after a few years of having it) because I wanted to be more femme.

Phase 5!
If I notice a girl in the streets instead of my normal ""she's cute"" etc, it's now changed into ""I wish I looked like that"" or ""I want those shoes!"" Etc.

Phase 6!
I have very recently (in the lat week) been quite unsatisfied with my male look shying away from the mirror sometimes, and constantly thinking on if I were to be a girl how my life would be better.

I also usually turn my nose up at any penetrative sex with my gf (unless it's on me) for the most part, and I think it's because I don't think it's me.

I have been feeling almost constantly anxious trying to find who I really am, and if I should come out (at least as a crossdresser) to my flatmate and potentially others so I can express myself the way I feel is right, and maybe find out if I'm trans.


TLDR:

I don't know who I am, am I just a crossdresser, am I gender fluid, am I trans, am I something else.

I really want to make sure it's a decision I am 100% okay with before I act on it, as I don't want to ruin my life more in case it is not what I want.

Anyone have ant insight or any advice or something I can try to use to figure all this out.


Edit:
It also makes me anxious the wait time to see a therapist for gender is 20 something months (UK btw)

2020-06-10 04:27:10,h03pdj,1,1,"Hello, First post here so sorry if this is not the place to be saying this, I am going to be 100% accurate to how i feel in this post unlike others.

First of all, my name is Jasper, i have been mtf for plus of 5 years (feels like it could be since birth tbh)  and just recently came out to my parents, some more info that may be helpful, I am 16, I live with my parents and am sort of in school, I dont work currently because I was layed off due to the virus, I cross dress in private when I,  I have had 2 instances in the recent past where I was required to call an ambulance to get out of the house due to depression, both times in the same week with no resolution, I have extreme anxiety and can barely talk to people in my household, I was adopted at the age of 18months, and have a sister that I disagree with, and a brother who has gotten into drugs and gang related activities even though he is 13.

So, with that out of the way I've come to see if i can get some advice on what i can do about my current situation. This felt like the most reasonable place to post this and if this is the wrong place please tell me where to re-locate this post. 

I came out to my parents on January 5th, by giving them a book that i wrote a note in explaining the situation, I told the it was important and it still took them till the 13th to read it. prior to this I was seeing a therapist about how I could come out to my parents with the least amount of stress. Should also be mentioned that my parents are both VERY religious and dont like hearing anything lgbt in the house and tend to point out that people are part of that community and that it is wrong. The stress of me keeping this a secret became so much that I pretty much have dropped out of school at this point. I was looking forward to the online school that covid has provided but out of the three courses that I need to get dont by the 19th of June, I have done almost nothing due to procrastination. 

So obviously, parents didnt take it well but havnt kicked me out yet. Since then i have been in an almost constant state of depression, and the news that one of my friends from work passed away from an overdose this morning has only sent me deeper into depression. I cant think of a time in 2020 that I havnt been trying to stop myself from ending my life, and my parents dont seem to be too worried about it, the first time I got home from the hospital due to depression my dad hanged me one of our shotguns and told me to go ahead and i cant say I wasnt tempted. I have become extremely violent to walls in the past few days, and am becoming increasingly violent to my cat, something i never thought would happen due to my love for animals (ime literally a furry) Ive stopped eating any meal that i am not required to attend (no breakfast or lunch, minimal amounts at dinner), and my weight has dropped about 8 pounds since the start of march, the upside to that is my waist is a cute size compared to my thighs now so i guess thats a plus. I am only getting an average of 4-5hours of sleep per night now, and can barely keep myself awake. I have almost completely stopped taking care of myself and am now just waiting for my breaking point. I feel that if i dont get help within the next few days I might lose to myself for the last time. My anxiety has made it so i can almost only talk to people online because I worry about judgement, Ive asked for money for therapy and have been denied the chance by my parents since coming out. since i dont work anymore and have to pay for my car I cant afford it and my anxiety wont allow me to represent the issues accurately. I cant get another job because of corona, and my failing education. I also have been fired twice due to poor attendance, and almost no one will take me anymore.

I would say the majority of my stress has come from my gender/sexuality, and have tried just being a dude as my parents want me to be, but i just cant get into that, It feels wrong and only makes things worse. I have contemplated attempting to find a way to self medicate for HRT but am afraid of getting caught, I have attempted to find people to talk to but am struggling with being truthful to them about how I feel.

If anyone needs more information, or has any suggestions to things I can do please either dm me on reddit for a slow response, or discord ( ùìôùì™ùìºùìπùìÆùìª‚Ñ¢#5521 ) or comment on this post.

2020-06-10 07:15:35,h05udx,0,2,"TLDR; Trans knowledge resources for ADHD/ASD people? Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks.

Hello all,

I am looking for some educational resources I can utilise to increase my awareness regarding trans-rights and knowledge.

I have done some research, but I have ADHD; my literal brain is struggling with the nuances and without a specific focus point I don't know where to start. 

My learning style is very intense; I ask lots and lots of questions and I can be a bit blunt/thoughtless if I'm really concentrating so I also don't want to put that on any one person if I can help it.

So far I've shied away from group conversations because the passion the topic evokes in others triggers my anxiety.

Whilst my basic mindset is supportive and I despise discrimination of any kind, I feel like it would be very easy for me to cause distress and as I don't want to do that intentionally,  I would be devastated to hurt someone unintentionally through my ignorance or my quest for understanding.

To be clear, my intention is not to debate the validity of trans rights, simply to clarify my understanding so as to advocate better from my position of privilege.

I'm happy to converse in the comments if anyone thinks they may have a perspective which will help me, but I would like to stress, I'm not demanding to be educated and I don't want anyone to feel obliged or responsible for my education. 

I'm just lost and looking for directions :) 

Thanks for taking the time to read and for any suggestions you might have.

Secondly I don't know if this is the right subereddit for critical questions or if this sub is purely celebratory. If the latter is true I would appreciate it if someone could link me to someplace where people meaningfully discuss trans experience and questions about it.

Maybe some background is useful here. I'm 23 and Dutch, I have been thinking about trans rights in society for a while now. It started with the 2016 Jordan Peterson outrage about preferred pronouns. I generally like to live and let live but some of the points that were raised by the opposition to transpronoun stuff seemed to me to have merit. Then again there were interviews with trans people who truly seemed to be better off after transitioning and after scfolling through some posts here it seemes that this experience is quite common. You could say I have seen some of the best and worst of both sides.

I have no trans people in my direct environment so that is why I take to the internet for this.

My first actual question is this: how were you able to actually realise that you were a different gender than your body would make people believe? I wonder about this because wrong diagnoses of mental instability or unhappiness are very common. For example I used to think a relationship would cure my unhappiness (spoilers, it didn't). So how did you determine it was your sex (gender? I'm not sure what to call it)? Again I would like to state that I am not questioning your stories but I am curious as to how people reach this conclusion. 

The second question is one that is more directed to the entire community than specifically to individuals: is there a point after which you would say that the trans rights movement has succeeded? Eradication transphobia is impossible, we tried to do it to other ideas but even fascism won't die out, so is there a tangible goal? For example if a certain law is passed or if transphobia is frowned upon like fascism is nowadays.

And my last question is this: is there a rolemodel in the trans rights movements whose ideas and methods are convincing and from which I might be able to learn more about trans rights and transnormative thinking? I would like to know where I could learn more about this way of thinking.

As a closing statement I would like to say again: please be gentle to one another (and to me as well) I don't want some internet shitthrowing contest, I want to understand your positions.

I've recently had several discussions where it's become clear that I need to talk to more Trans people and better understand the issues you face. I acknowledge that it's not any of your *jobs* to educate me, so this is more of a request if anyone's interested.

The types of things I'd like to know more about are what it means to be a ""man"" or a ""woman"" in your POV, what you make of the positions that people like J.K. Rowling (or other older feminists) hold, what you think of issues of minors transitioning, etc. Of course, I'm sure there are questions I don't even know to ask.

I actually live in a very liberal area with a large Trans community, but I am not regularly in contact with many Trans people. I'm a hetero, white, male in case you're wondering.

If you are interested, I'm happy to use any forum you're most comfortable with.

Thank you very much in advance.

2020-06-11 00:19:53,h0o26x,4,0,"Hi all! 

Hoping someone would be able to point me in the right direction. I'm a cis man, with a background in Gender Studies, who teaches, among other things, Gender and Sexuality awareness for a living, so it's really embarrassing I don't have a well-reasoned answer to this already, but... 

If we operate on the assumption that gender is a social construct/performative and not innate/based on anatomical sex (and therefore reject essentialist views of gender identity), then why do we accept that trans* people have an innate feeling about what their gender is? In other words, if all gender is drag (yay Butler!) and we all learn/are conditioned into being men or women, why do trans* people go 'against the grain'? 

Also, I apologise in advance, I realise this sounds vaguely like veiled transphobia, but I promise it isn't. It was a question posed to me by a student in one of my seminars that I genuinely didn't know how to answer.

I'm a cis man, with a background in Gender Studies, who teaches, among other things, Gender and Sexuality awareness for a living, so it's really embarrassing I don't have a well-reasoned answer to this already, but... \n\nIf we operate on the assumption that gender is a social construct/performative and not innate/based on anatomical sex (and therefore reject essentialist views of gender identity), then why do we accept that trans* people have an innate feeling about what their gender is? In other words, if all gender is drag (yay Butler!) and we all learn/are conditioned into being men or women, why do trans* people go 'against the grain'? \n\nAlso, I apologise in advance, I realise this sounds vaguely like veiled transphobia, but I promise it isn't.

2020-06-11 04:52:59,h0sdiz,5,25,"Hey guys,

I am currently writing this with a bit more drugs on me than I should, so forgive me for going a bit on the emotional rollercoaster side of things. I will delete this post if this is inappropiate or offensive in any way, shape or form.

I have been seeing a lot of hate these days after the whole JK Rowling twit situation. It's nothing new, but it just made me feel very upset. I also recently had a chance to become more involved in LGBTQ+ and specifically trans issues by joining a community called SPECTRUM, in which I learned a lot. I probably still have tons to learn.

And a lot of the things I learned are very sad realities that trans people face in their daily lives. And while it is slightly improving (in my country), it is still a worlwide issue that needs a lot of addressing.

I'm a cis woman, with some doubts about my own sexuality - sometimes I think I'm bisexual, sometimes I don't. And I don't want to make this post to flaunt myself (please throw eggs at me if I do), but just because I feel very emotional about it right now.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want you to know that I support you, unconditionally. That there are a lot of people who do, too. That I wanna fight for your rights until you have equal opportunities. I wanna fight for you in every way I can, whether it's defending you, educating ignorant people or just fighting by your side.

To me, you are a person, who deserve respect and love, and nobody should ever spew the vitriol they often do about you. Nobody should ever have their parents, family, friends look down on them for identifying with a different gender than the biological sex they were born with. The more I read, the more it makes me feel like crying because it's painful to know the things that trans people go through since childhood. And then I feel like a crybaby because this is not my struggle, but I just can't help it when the hate of the world comes slap me in the face as a reality.

From being denied your identity, to being misunderstood, to having to drop out of school due to harassment and have no other choice but prostitution. Which I am not against by itself, but it should always be a choice. Even in 2020 people still understand so little about sex and gender. Even in 2020 we have to stand ignorant people talk about you as if they knew better, as if you weren't the main participants in the conversations and the voices that need to be heard first and foremost. And then we have public figures make awful statements that just seem to push it back. And worst, people defending her.

I don't even know what the point of this post was. Truth is, I just spent a lot of time arguing with someone in another forum about transgender people and trans rights.

I guess I just wanted to tell you guys that I love you and that I have your back, always, even if I don't know each one of you personally. I want a world in which you can safely feel, wear, think, do, work as whatever you want.

2020-06-11 09:45:02,h0w60q,2,1,"Hey, I'm not even sure, if I'm on the right subreddit, but I need to ask a question. I‚Äôm seeking to reconnect with a friend, who is probably trans. We used to have a lot in common, including (apparently) confusion about our identities and sexuality.
I am going to share some back story, if you don't want to read that, there's basic TLDR at the bottom.



When I was around 12 years old, I had some health issue and was hospitalised at the children's section, with rooms of 2. In the beginning, my roommate was a little kid. She was a lot, the nurses liked me and knew that with my problem, I would appreciate some peace and silence.
During the lunches, I noticed that there's a girl my age, she is looking at me frequently and would probably like to talk. But being my stuck-up (except actually really insecure) self, I pretended like I didn't notice her at all. Well, after a few days, the nurses came to tell me they decided to switch my roommate and placed this girl with me. I, of course, acted (overly) confident, and we quickly became friends, we made noise and laughed late into the night - the nurses began to regret they put us together.

Anyway, we stayed in contact with and texted almost every day. We even made plans - went to the movies a few times, were hanging out even pretty late to the night considering our age... We shared our deepest darkest secrets (and they were dark). She would like to hang more often and even make home visits and sleepovers - me at her place, she at mine when her parents pissed her off... But that wouldn't happen, because I was brought up very religious and I was taught it‚Äôs not good to be friends ""too much"" with anyone. I knew I would have to endure a weird mood and guilt-tripping at home if I bring someone over. Also, thanks to my upbringing, I would feel very uncomfortable being over at someone's place. Not that I was mature enough to explain that to her this way, I would simply shrug it off and not explain it to her at all. Despite that, I know I was her best friend at the time and I think she was mine.
Anyway, she became pretty depressed, I was dealing with a lot too. My father is a psychologically abusive narcissistic psychopath, and I was basically living in a religious cult at the time... I felt like her overall vibe was bringing me down and making me even more unhappy then I was. I‚Äôm not proud of it, but I started to kind of ghost her. She didn't understand what was happening. Sometimes I would pick her call and tell her I'll contact her soon and then either didn't or would shoot her a short not very welcoming message. Naturally, as time progressed, she stopped making an effort and we lost contact. A side note is, I was at my rock bottom, basically ghosted all my friends, began home-schooling, and almost didn't leave my room for the next 4 years.
Well, then I started to make actual plans on how to get out of the life that's making me unhappy. I began working, finished high school, made my driver‚Äôs license, called a psychologist to help my siblings, filled a lawsuit against my father, helped the CPS to kick him out of our household and left the cult I was brought up in. Then I got into uni, made some new friends, got an FWB, admitted to myself that I‚Äôm at least bisexual (still not acting on that tho)... I just turned my life around. I recognise I still don't have the best personality and I‚Äôm working on it. I finally found psychologist for myself too. I am really trying to shake my past off and be a better person. I thought about her pretty often, but I couldn't even stalk her on socials because neither one of us had them. Or maybe she did, later on, only I didn't because I don't want the elders to stalk my apostate life.

Now enough about me. I know I still have a lot to work on myself, but it's maybe more than 3 years since I talked to her, and the more time passes, the weirder it is to reach out. So, I reached out today. I simply texted that I remembered her because I was in her old neighbourhood and I wonder how is she doing.
She replied in like 10 minutes something along the lines like: 'Wow... the weirdest part of my past is getting to me :D. I‚Äôm finishing a semester now, but maybe we can hang out after :)?'
I replied: 'Lol well I‚Äôm not really surprised to be categorised as such, but still :D. Anyway sure, I‚Äôm done with my exams, so it's up to you.'
And she replied: 'Yea I will be glad :), things are just really busy now, but I‚Äôm making a note to my calendar and will text you :)'.
I replied: 'Sure, hmu after you got time :)'.

And here is finally the thing - in the second message, she sent, she used verbs in a masculine form (btw all this was not in the English language, we are European). I remembered that like a year ago I was deleting my old WhatsApp convos and saw her profile picture. I couldn't see it clearly but thought that she looked very butch. That didn't surprise me at the time tho. We both used to talk about how we would like to have short hair and how we love to wear shirts and suits... Well, I looked at her current profile picture, and I‚Äôm pretty sure that the masculine verbs in the message weren't a mistake.
I am not even sure she (they?) will actually make plans with me, but if so, I want to behave correctly. I really miss them, and I don't want to fuck it up again. Should I act like I am not surprised at all, don't ask anything and just talk about other news? Or should I ask about it? If they knew even way back when we used to hang out? How did their family react? Are they in a better place now...? Or just when I see them first, I casually ask if their name is still the same and then talk about other topics? I just don't know how to react when I first see them. I want to be supportive.
I worry I‚Äôll say something dumb or insensitive. I am way past my old religious views, I just want to be friends if they'll have me.




TLDR: I reconnected with an old friend, they are very much likely trans, and I don't know how to act if we meet up

It was always just a dream and a fantasy, something I laid down at night and enjoyed thinking about before sleep. After finding this out I immediately felt alive and hopeful, me being a person who has almost lived inside their room the majority of my life due to extreme anxiety and dysmorphia. I began training my voice and working on weight loss, slowly coming out to my friends. More and more I felt myself, I felt true. Lost a few friends who weren't so accepting but gained so many more and closer friends. Now it's June of 2020 and I'm closing into my weight goal that I set and got pretty decent with feminizing my voice, I had set a date for my birthday to come out which is in a couple months, but that ended up putting a lot of pressure on me and gave me a lot of anxiety which led to me coming out a few days ago to my mom to try and calm the pressure. Me barely hanging onto the bed trying to not faint as I told her how I felt, completely dramatic and erratic she started yelling at me after I got the courage to tell her. She told me that I will go to hell and burn and I won't be with my family after I die, how I have a sickness and mental illness and they need to get me help for it... After we finally parted from the room I was completely devastated but I was hopeful that maybe the next day would be a bit better and that it was just complete shock that led to that. We had some texts back and forth that weren't too great but I was still being patient. So next day comes and well my mom just opens up on me hard again and this time bringing up not allowing ""this shit"" to be around her granddaughter and just all kinds of terrible things that made me feel like a complete monster. She told me that my grandmother had stopped drinking but now because of this is drinking again.. I felt/feel so alone and lost and scared. The way they look at me has changed so much.. I'm afraid they will somehow file insanity papers and have me locked away so they don't have to deal with it or to have me ""fixed"".

I started wearing a bandana on my face because I can\'t stand to be seen anymore by them, the looks pierce me so deep. I honestly don\'t know what to do anymore and my mental is deteriorating over all this..   \n\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar or have any advice on what I can do in this situation? I\'m currently trying to get an apartment but I don\'t know if I could afford one. I have $220 saved and I am on disability income atm. I also don\'t have transportation sorta, my friend may be able to help me in that regards.  \n\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/oNTjHmn](https://imgur.com/a/oNTjHmn)  this is the texts between me and my mom &gt;.&lt;', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'coming out disaster :(', 'created': 1591924002.0}"

Maybe advice on convincing them into letting me at least get on puberty blockers? I just can\'t handle them anymore and I need to do something.

I'm a 31 year old male, US military veteran (not that it's important), I am happily married and we have one child,  I've recently come out to my (supportive af! :) , spouse about transition. The discussion went exactly as I thought, she definitely had some valid points, such as, how will my  son react? or even understand such a major change at 9 years old?.  Still an open discussion between us... hopefully we can find some valid advice and come up with a solid plan.

 I've been experiencing gender dysphoria my whole life. Growing up was a very confusing time as I was more attuned to feminine life choices, much to the dismay of my parents (my grandma was the cool one). 

 I feel lucky living in a time where so many changes are happening in the world...for better or worse.
 
Extremely excited, and I want to start transition asap.
 
As of this post, because of my position, as a parent, I fear being delayed which would cause me greif, however it would be the best, for my son's sake, to do research and wait till I know how to approach the situation.

More backstory... During my time in the military, I had experienced numerous signs of gender dysphoria, all the while, cracking jokes with ""conservative"" minded individuals.  Periodically during the banter, I would drop hints to the truth of my disposition... always going unnoticed annoyingly.

Amidst all of the daily bullshit that a sevice member would usually goes through, there's the ever-expected shit-storm of punishments for my ""less than adequate physical ability"", I was subject to verbal and physical abuse in private on more than one occasion, by multiple higher ranking people, most of them being more physically superior as well. 

One incident that I'll never forget: being made to physically exhaust one's self completely to muscular failure, then forced to don ""full battle rattle"",(all of my gear, armor, helmet, gas mask, etc.) All weighing about 35+lbs in total, on top of the heat of mid summer at noon.

 In such a poor state of exhaustion, I was grabbed by the back of my kevlar helmet(choking me in the process), dragged face-down through a hallway and and down a single flight of about 20ish steep stairs, head-first and down another 15ft hallway. At this point I was in tears sobbing and gasping, looking like a hot mess on the floor as they all stood yelling at me saying, ""I wasn't a man"", and ""who allowed You to reproduce (my wife at the time was 6 months pregnant)"",after which I was made to squeeze my own testicles and recite that "" this is my rifle, this is my gun"" bullshit...   This, about 90 days before a 12 month deployment to Iraq!  My son was 6 months old when I returned home...  I made it through the worst.

Sorry for the sob story tho...
Just the tip of the iceberg of PTSD, Anxiety, and depression.


So for me, I know transitioning would be the healing that I need to become the person I am inside.üíØüî•

2020-06-12 04:28:32,h7dyjk,17,22," 

This is my first time posting, but also my first time finally admiting to myself and others what I've been thinking and feeling for a long time, I beg for understanding and advice, I'm in a very vulnerable state and the only think I want is to be understood.

I'll tell my story first, I was born female, I had a good childhood and when I was 13-14 years old my breast developed too fast and they were too big for my age, it starting getting the attention of men, many of them way older than me and that scared me and made me hate and feel shame for my body, later I found out I was homosexual.

I wasn't a very femenine girl, but also not a butch, I dated a few girls, it was all nice and good, but I kept hating that part of my body, and I started hating every part of it with time. Talking to other LGBT people introduced me to the trans comunity and made me think like I was part of it.

I wanted to change this body forever, get rid of my breast, have a new face, be treated differently, not like an inferior person forever just because I was born female. So I came out, and surprisingly my parents supported me after some talks, I told them the usual thing ""I've always felt like this"" ""this is not who I really am"" They understood.

At 18 years old I finally got my mastectomy, what I always wanted, a flat chest, using shirts and not seeing awkwards, annoying bits, I thought I was going to turn into the person that I wanted to be.

I started T a year later, that's when this hell started.

My voice changed in a matter of weeks, but the inner voice in my head never did, it was still my feminine soft voice, not the new stranger male voice that I heard when I spoke, it freaked me out, like it was another person taking control of my body, I started changing and I started realizing that I was hating it all, the body hair, the curves turning into straight lines, I wanted to stop, but everyone was so proud of me, I felt like I would betray them if I do.

Life didn't got more exciting, but people treated me differently.

I thought I wanted the men benefits but I don't, the way men treat me with the respect they almost never did when I was a woman makes me want to go back to being a woman, I feel like I'm in the wrong side, like I crossed a line that I was never supposed to cross, like I completely fucked up my life, I feel more trapped than ever, I don't want to be seen as a guy anymore, but if I tell them to address me with female pronouns while my voice is this thick, they'll laugh.

I want to erase all this and start again, I want my life and my body back, I want to go back to being a lesbian, to have lesbian relationships and enjoy that warm comfort in knowing we're both girls loving each other, I wish I appreciated it more, I wish I thought it better and realized that my relationships were going to be straight from the moment I turned into a man, that I was going to be stuck in the male role forever. I'm so scared because I don't want it.

My second worst mistake was putting all my hopes and effort into this, because now I have nothing, I don't know who I am, what I'm going to do with my life, what I'm going to be, I lied to everyone incluiding myself and I'm just realizing it now, when it's too late.

I need some advice because I'm feeling like I'm going to drown, like I have nothing left.

Dear Mom

For the next however long this takes to read may you please just do two things for me, firstly just read this letter in its entirety, don't look up, don't look at me and don‚Äôt pause or stop reading, and secondly may you just please have an open mind while reading this

Ever since i can first remember i have never truly felt like a real person or that i was living life how i wanted to live it. This has especially been true in the last couple of years. I've never been unhappy with life but at the same time i have never been happy with life either. In recent times however i can‚Äôt truly say that i've gone an entire day feeling happy. I  have for such a long time now felt more and more that my life is me acting out this character and not truly being myself. And i don‚Äôt know when this started but i am now in the situation that i don't know if i can stop it and truly be me, and this is why i am writing this.

Honestly speaking I never thought I would write this and have kept this a secret from you forever, but I just can't do that anymore, I can't take it anymore. 

I'm not entirely who you think I am, and I'm pretty sure that I'm not who you want me to be. The truth is that i am transgender and i have know this for a very long time. If you're not okay with that then please just throw away this paper right now and i'll never mention it again. If you are okay with this, then turn the page.

I know this may come as a shock to you and you still may not understand it, but eventually you will start to see all the signs. I also know this may not make sense to you either, but life doesn't make sense either, you don't really get to choose who you are and you don't get to decide what makes you happy.

I also know that something like this is not just scary for me but for you as well, but change will happen slowly. However saying all of this i do want to start with HRT (hormone replacement therapy) as soon as possible because i can't stand life with this constant gender dysphoria and i know that hrt help to reduce this drastically and i really just want to live life as i was meant to and finally be confident being myself. Hopefully you understand all of this and decide to support me with my transformation and possible surgery in the future, whether it's top or bottom surgery, only time will see. And i just want to quickly add another word to your vocabulary assuming that you still love me as you are still reading this. The new word is pansexuality and that is what i am, if you are unsure what that means then this next definition from google should help, **Pansexuality** is sexual, romantic or emotional attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender identity.",trans,Can anyone please tell me if this is any good.,1592007305.0,"{'created_utc': 1591982105, 'id': 'h7ov4l', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': "" \n\nDear Mom\n\nFor the next however long this takes to read may you please just do two things for me, firstly just read this letter in its entirety, don't look up, don't look at me and don‚Äôt pause or stop reading, and secondly may you just please have an open mind while reading this\n\nEver since i can first remember i have never truly felt like a real person or that i was living life how i wanted to live it.

Im pretty sure I'm trans. I think I'm mtf.  
  
This scares me. Im not one hundred percent sure. I can't come out, Not yet. I don't want too come out.  
  
I'm scared. Im scared of going completely through puberty before coming out. I dont want the effects of puberty without knowing who I truly am.  
  
I don't want to worry about my bone structure, or my voice. Or hair in the wrong places. But I feel if I don't come out soon... My body will just force that on me.  
  
I don't want to be a grow up. Never have, and being trans is just adding on more fears. I love this community, but me myself as trans... It scares me.   
  
I want to come out, but I cant. I hate those types of conversations. The air, the feeling. I can barely handle it.  
  
And I don't know if I'm even actually a female. Maybe Im just a more feminine man. But the more I think about it... Im more sure.    
  
I don't want to go through puberty.  
  
I don't want to have my body change without my permission.  
  
I don't want to be confused.  
  
I don't want to bean adult.  
  
I don't want to grow up.  
  
I'm scared. I don't know if I'll  actually post this. It's just me rambling at 6 in the morning. I'm over heated, Im scared to post this.  
  
I don't know what to do.  
  
I don't know how to stop this.  
  
Im so freaking confused. Lazy. Unhealthy, tired.
  
I know coming out might help that, But I can't.  
  
I know at this point I'm repeating myself, But this is how I feel.  
  
I feel as if the friends I have told that Im questioning with being a girl don't take me seriously.  
  
I feel isolated, and alone, even though there are so many communities, right here even, I could talk to.  
  
I feel as if... If I were to come out it would be horrible. Even though I know my family would be supportive, I might regret it. I might force myself into it without being prepared.

I feel as if Im the moon, going through all its phases at once.  
  
I feel as if, I want to be alive.  
  
I'm starting to feel alone.  
  
I'm starting to fear myself.  
  
I'm feeling imposter syndrome, and even though I know it... It doesn't stop. I don't know what to do, I feel as if Im losing all motivation, and doing nothing as my life spirals out of control.  
  
I probably already f**ked myself out of my two favorite classes, maybe even my school. My friends. Everyone I was starting to become friends with.

I ask you this because yesterday night,I finally had the guts to tell my parents about this and how I've been having this feeling all my life. The thing is that my father was shocked at the beginning, but then he became angry and started yelling at me a lot of stuff like ""you are born as a male, you get a female and then you make a family, thats the correct thing to do because its normal"".

I mean... I was so dissapointed, my dad has been always so full of knowledge, so smart, I never thought he could have this kind of opinion. ""What did you expect me to do? To accept it? This is not normal, you are just being stupid and something int your mind is wrong, go get a therapist or something"", he said.

Good news, looks like my mother knew this since some years ago, I had a diary back then and it looks like she rode it before I got rid of it. She's supporting me on this, but now I'm afraid of my dad, I dont want him to get mad at me or my mom.

I don't know, I just wanna keep up with my career, get a job, start being more and more independent and then... I'll be who I really wanna be.

I could use an advice, btw. I really want to know what are your opinions about this since many of you have passed through this before.

2020-06-13 18:05:19,h8cene,2,8," 

I heard a tale the other day

Of a wizard‚Äôs mother who claims

That a crimson truth defines

If you really are what you say

&amp;#x200B;

A mudblood could be forgiven

For thinking strange this division

For one such voiced the thought

Decrying such a derision

&amp;#x200B;

Still, fright abounds in the minds

Of those too eager to find

A violation in a bathroom stall

By one used to tucks or binds

&amp;#x200B;

I am one of those they fear

Shaking on the toilet near

Bladder desperate for relief

Hoping the stream they won‚Äôt hear

&amp;#x200B;

Concerned my face isn‚Äôt quite right

That I‚Äôll be clocked at a mere sight

Summoning up all the courage

To stand and step back into light

&amp;#x200B;

Eyes down, straight to the basin,

Wash, rinse, dry, leave, time‚Äôs wasting

A door opens and I brace myself

No clue who I‚Äôll be facing

&amp;#x200B;

Will they be one of them, out to out

Those like me, to scream and shout

That I‚Äôm nothing more than two letters

And that they know what I‚Äôm all about?

&amp;#x200B;

Or will it simply be another trying to pee,

Caring less who I am or trying to be,

More concerned with the state of the seat

Than with my gender identity?

&amp;#x200B;

Try to walk out like all is fine,

Knowing not what I will find

Beyond the door to the outside,

Perhaps one waiting to rewind

&amp;#x200B;

Compassion for all the souls

Torn betwixt opposite goals,

To be accepted or accept themselves,

Either choice will take its toll

&amp;#x200B;

I did not choose, to be clear,

To question what some hold dear,

I simply chose to reconcile

Dissonance of mind and mirror

&amp;#x200B;

To tap what seems a syncopation

Accenting, they say, an aberration

To bring together self and soul

In harmonious synchronization

&amp;#x200B;

I am now what I have always been,

Though hidden behind grimace and grin,

The person I so long denied

Not knowing how or where to begin

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I meekly spoke

Aloud the burden of that yoke

And found not hate but hands

Who helped me drop that cloak

&amp;#x200B;

To feel more myself and whole

Than I ever thought I‚Äôd know

And time has confirmed

The truth of this way I go

&amp;#x200B;

Guess this is how I ‚Äúreinforce

Old stereotypes‚Äù and endorse

Erasure of ‚Äúman‚Äù and ‚Äúwoman,‚Äù

What a show of force!

&amp;#x200B;

So those in power decree

No more protections for we

Who simply pray to find

An ally in our journey

&amp;#x200B;

In so doing, they hope to end

What they call a brand new trend

And with other Orders combined

Trans rights they wish to rend

&amp;#x200B;

But these rights do not belong to us alone

They are simply human, as flesh and bone

If you say naught and let such things stand

The stripping of all rights you condone

&amp;#x200B;

So if and when you worry

Over demons in the lavatory

2020-06-14 05:44:23,h8o5r1,7,1,"Hello my fellow human beings, I am new to this forum and appreciate being allowed to join.

Not long ago posting here, even lurking here would have caused me severe anxiety to the point of impossibility.

I am a mid thirties attorney in the closet, often literally, since that‚Äôs where my clothes are-hidden away on a shelf out of view, but not by choice.

I came out to my family, but my wife was too afraid and too unwilling to accept my transition and so after a year of pushing her and going to regular and gender therapists the pain of her reaction and my concern for my young son‚Äîwho has learning disabilities we are working through, forced my transition to yield.

I was so close to HRT, and dressing as myself regularly but being told ‚Äúyou cannot do that in front of our son‚Äù and ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to go out like that, right?‚Äù By my wife just was too much to bear. Soon I told her all is well and I‚Äôm just going to be what she expects, even though I know that this is an eventual impossibility. Or that it appears to be so.

And so now my watch begins.

Welcome to purgatory limbo! Just like that Oingo Boingo song, except with the zombified living, not the dead.

It is not just my wife that stood in my way, my boss openly mocked transgender people in a meeting‚Äîhe had no idea about me as far as I know, and may be trans himself he kept saying ‚Äúsissy‚Äù ‚Äúsissy‚Äù when he weak putted at a company golf event, so who knows...

And my mother is supportive but skeptical and the rest of my family confused.

And so I literally went back in the closet‚ÄîI had been taking weight loss hormones and so my wife blamed that on my confession of truth, and since around a year and half ago, everyone has moved on.

In my wife and family‚Äôs eyes, I am no longer trans.

Just a proto-typical cisgender male attorney, successful financially and normal asf.

But yeah, no that‚Äôs not true ;)

I feel somewhat insane, somewhat repressed and somewhat free. I know you are out there, my people. Even though I have only ever met a precious few of you in person and have no friends beyond casual acquaintances. I still do feel your love and your pain. Maybe here I will meet some people my age, Susan‚Äôs place was great but I felt misunderstood there often. 

Transition talk is beautiful but my world is like Pluto, cold barren and unlikely to be unfrozen for quite some time; heck, it‚Äôs not even a recognized planet anymore!

Aside from being transgender, I have some unusual experiences. I ran away at 17 to Mexico and after making it across the border without a picture ID (it was a long time ago) I moved on with my absentee fathers parents and was able to go to undergrad and law school and eventually inherited the family comeuppance when my father sued his mother on Mother‚Äôs Day and got disinherited (aka: ‚ÄúKarma‚Äù ;)‚Äîmore recently I just settled litigation with my ‚Äúfather‚Äù to extricate myself from a poisonous family with a couple of scheckles in my pocket...

This was all militating against transitioning, having to deal with this other transition, from a denizen of a trailer park to a person who is responsible for substantial wealth; all while in an unhappy marriage that makes my being me impossible;

Irony being cost is not a problem, but my wife‚Äôs fear and reactionary approach being the barrier‚ÄîI do not want my son to experience a split family where my wife smears me in court to seek full custody (she declared this would be her approach many times; and yes being a lawyer I am less afraid, but it is not me I am concerned for, but my son).

So yeah, now I am at a new plateau, hello reddit, hello r/trans‚Äîat least our current situation is letting me grow my hair out, even if I have to grow a beard to avoid my wife‚Äôs criticism...

Sexually, I have never had the chance but I am sure I would be pretty uncomfortable with the idea itself, even if the given person is attractive and fully transitioned.

I am saying this to clearly put my cards on the table and where I am coming from. I am not an enemy but I am not an active ally either. I am a neutral party that just let's people do what they do because life is too short to care about things that other people do that don't hurt people. That's just how I view things.


Recently, however, since the JK Rowling incident, a lot of trans related topics have popped up on my feed and I have questions and opinions about them. I would like to know how the trans community, as an individual and as a whole, feel about the opinions I have. I am sure the opinions aren't new and neither will I change opinions that you already have but I am here to learn and validate or invalidate my beliefs and try to understand if there is a piece I am missing. I am here to learn if possible and if nothing else, to understand even if we disagree.


My first question is related to JK Rowling and her tweet in that, what is wrong people being differentiated by their sex, rather than gender. I will address gender in a later topic but for now, I just to get this out of the way. Sex is an undeniable biological fact of nature. It is like your race and with that, comes some undeniable biological consequences. I believe, and correct me if I am wrong, she meant,""Periods are biologically a female thing and it is okay to address it as such as opposed to trying to coherce into a narrative that fits an trans agenda."" Which I don't think is wrong. Sex is a one of the factors in life we have not been able to change yet. We won't know the future but it is undeniable that periods only happen to people with uterus and those are biologically women. So do you feel it's wrong to put sex above gender and why?


Secondly, transgender women in sports. We know for a fact that biology plays a part in physiology. I don't think it's always the fact but I also think those are exceptions, not the rule. What I don't understand is why are these factors not as important as just being a woman. This doesn't bother me as much as I empathize with ciswomen who feel cheated out of something they have worked harder for because we know biological women have to work harder than men to even reach a stature that is comparable due to the nature of how we are. So why is that in the word,""Transwoman"", the more important word is,""Woman"" and not,""Trans"" because not only does it provide clarity to the situation, it makes your choice apparent. Every time a transwoman identifies herself as a woman or I hear transwomen are women too, it just feels like they are trying to deny what they are from the bottom of their heart and I get it to an extent. Some of you are trying to deny it because that is not the existent you wanted or are comfortable with but as a human being, I feel something you have to learn to accept rather than ignore it. What I am saying is just why isn't the transformative the focus, which better defines you and why aren't you your own category instead of being a woman? Whats bad about transwomen and ciswomen different things and if it's not, why isn't it a thing? Why put yourself in a situation where you can never belong because you never were part of it in the first place?


And finally, I'd like to ask this because it bugs the hell out of me. In a progressive society where gender roles are being abolished and everything is trying to be made gender neutral, why do we need genders and why do we care about them? It's confusing because the whole idea of being gender neutral was so there would be no pressure to anyone to do anything that is right now considered gender based actions. Bringing more genders into it just makes gender roles more prevalent in my opinion so what is with the whole spectrum of genders? Are we waiting for all gender roles to be abolished? Because if we are, this is a terrible way of doing it because this just creates the idea that gender is important to identify a person and hence, more gender stereotypes will be introduced/ strengethed and not the other way around. What am I missing from this discussion?



If any of this felt like an attack, I assure you it is not. It's simply my desire to listen to the otherside. I am not saying my mind will change just because I hear your side.

2020-06-14 11:28:11,h8s5y3,0,1,"I'm transmasculine. So for some backstory I've been questioning my gender identity for roughly 8 years on and off in my early twenties then pretty regularly after around 25.

 I'm 29 now but working abroad and not currently in a position to transition though I'm interested in getting HRT and top surgery when I'm able to do so. I've thought very carefully through the decisions to do so and am taking my time working through all this. At the same time I'm feeling like I'm losing time as well, but I'm living out other life goals. I've also stopped dating because I don't want to date men, (I like men) who will regard me and treat me as female in a relationship. I wouldn't want a partner to touch my chest.

 I recently cut my hair short into a two block style, which I'd wanted for a while. I've had it sort several times before now but this time it felt liberating. Wearing women's clothes or feminine clothing felt strange because it contrasted so heavily with how masculine my hair made me look, but wearing men's clothes before that didn't look right because my hair was too feminine so I was stuck. 

I bought more men's clothes than I had before, and was excited to do so. Everything was matching up but I have dysphoria about my chest and hips and purposefully buy clothes a size bigger than I am to cover those areas and it brings me enough of a sense of euphoria. I'm happy when I'm regarded as male in public though most people see me as looking very young like a high school student. I've felt perceptible changes in the men and women around me as well. I've felt dysphoria around my voice more lately because it gives me away, so to say.

 In general though I feel like I'm trying to force myself into the binary trans box but it doesn't feel right. I'm not fully a trans man. But if I'm not a trans MAN I feel like I'm a fraud and I feel like media I see about trans people, mostly on YouTube affirms this, that if you're not binary trans you're a confused trender. My hobbies aren't particularly masculine. My personality or mannerisms aren't either and I don't feel the need to change that. I don't need to perform a hyper masculinity that just isn't me. But I also feel dysphoria when being referred to as female. There's a shame around the identity non binary that feels pervasive. I want to transition via HRT but I'm terrified of male pattern baldness to the point where if my hair thinned I would go off of T to keep my hair. I've thought about going on T only for a year or two then going off. At that point I'd have my voice, my bottom growth, I'd be relatively happy. I would be sad about losing the body fat redistribution and not being able to build muscle like a guy as a male body is what I want. But in other words losing my hair would also be dysphoria inducing. Body hair and facial hair would give me dysphoria as well I think as of now, but I can endure that. Today, right now in this moment I feel invalid. I feel like I'm not real because I'm not binary.

 I just watched some random FTM Detransition videos that were randomly in my YouTube algorithm just to get some perspective. Then there was one by a trans guy saying ""when I was a trender"" with non binary label captions. That was disconcerting to me and it just makes me feel terrible. Those people however typically did not go to therapy first and transitioned without questioning much at very young ages in their teens which is already a tumultuous time of self discovery. I'm clearly in a little of a different situation and nearly twice their age. I don't feel either way about my gender right now but I'm just stressed.

I feel like people might try to comfort me by saying ""you're valid"" but I truly deeply wonder if I really am. I feel like people just say that. And there's not as much non binary representation it feels, no one consistent who has gone through transition and is still non binary etc. It's either trender or now I'm binary trans after transitioning and I'm just stressed about it. Both binary gender characteristics give me dysphoria. It's distressing.

2020-06-14 15:54:47,h8wamn,2,1," It sure where to put this; but looking for like minded people; this is a response to a question about the metaphysical book I am working on:


Well I have been pondering the meaning of Life for quite some time and came to the conclusion that the purpose of Life (the totality of it) is to propagate, survive and become increasingly complicated pursuant to the concept of ever increasing entropy;

Assuming you believe in evolutionary theory and mainstream cosmology; this principle, of increasingly complex entropy (randomness in a closed system) is born first in the material world, in the sense that from the basic blocks of matter, energy and light all things were created, and that to start such a process there was a first mover; so that;

If [First Mover] Then [Existence of all things in the Universe]‚Äîor what religious folks call ‚ÄúGod‚Äù, and/or the ‚ÄúUltimate Reality‚Äù, and what non religious folks call simply the Universe based upon fixed rules.

So imagine this: matter energy and light self assemble into more and more complex forms; such as nebulae, suns, planets, asteroids, singularities, comets, etc.

These themselves go through an evolution over the course of 14 Billionish years; and these structures ‚Äúlive and die‚Äù; I.e. large suns live shorter lifetimes, explode and then reform; and all of this comes from a First Mover, which under God Theory is alive.

My position is that while we cannot prove that God exists, or how God exists, that when you look at this process it seems more probably that God does exist and is immanent or otherwise able to exert force on all matter energy and light in the Universe; which pursuant to quantum theory is always in a state of agitated movement‚Äîor which in my view seems ‚Äúalive‚Äù.

And so; bit of a diatribe,  but not really; let‚Äôs call the animate evolution of matter energy and light from the Big Bang on; Life evolution Part 1‚Äìprecursors to Life.

Now on to Part II; Rise of Sentient Life from the ‚ÄúClay‚Äù.

And so with basic Life evolution principles, microbes literally terraformed the Earth (One Strange Rock on Netflix illustrates this very well) and from these basic blocks‚Äîorganisms like diatoms literally convert sunlight (energy/light) and minerals (sand; or otherwise ‚Äúinert‚Äù matter which we know is animate, but on a scale imperceptible at the level of classical physics‚ÄîI.e. if you don‚Äôt have an electron microscope granite appears static...) into Organics.

From these microbes, more and more complex life was created via a cycle of (1) conversion of EM&amp;C to organics, (2) storage of learned data (memory, which I believe to be literally embedded in our ever increasingly complex DNA and other genetic coding), (3) the passing of such DNA‚Äîto be crude ‚Äúfing‚Äù or to be scientific propagation, (4) and organic waste processing, shiing, dying and the decomposition of both. (Also why we love to say these words Fck, sht and God)

Eventually after eons, human beings, dolphins, dogs, elephants, great apes, etc. started to show strong signs of sentience‚Äîawareness of their own existence and formation of complex societies‚ÄîI.e. super organisms. As far as we know humans are the most promising of these super organisms‚Äîin that we actually modify our environment to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù new formats of matter and also more importantly recorded complex thought.

Now we are on the forefront of what I call Part III: Life‚Äôs creation of synthetic Life, and the Merger of The Material World with Organics‚Äîthe Age of Artificial Intelligence.

What I mean is that we can achieve literal immortality by merging with the contrived material world; computers, robotics to evolutionist ourselves into a cybernetic society.

A world society; one that starts to move beyond the Earth; where resources are plentiful (one asteroid can have Trillions in precious metals for example) and start to raise ourselves up on the Kardeshev Scale to create things like Dyson spheres and eventually bend all of the matter energy and light in the Galaxy and even the Universe under the will of sentience; I.e. to make the Universe Sentient‚Äîwhich I believe is what the First Mover, I.e. God wants.

And with this infinite life span we can begin to assemble all of the pieces of Universal Truth, of which the closest thing I have discovered is this:

[pursuant to Probability where 0 is 100% nullity and 1 is 100% certainty] 0 (nothing) plus Infinity= 1 (perfect probability of Existence. A mathematical proof of God, when taken in the context of First Mover Theory where God bootstrapped the Universe from nothing‚Äîor the Zero (not to be complex but I believe in brand theory and so Zero is truly beyond our Universe implying our God may be part of an even larger God; which in logical terms is simply the Absolute and Universal All).

Consider irrational numbers, pi for example, or just the simple principle of infinite decimals and you can see the basic probability equation as one of infinite possibilities,  it with defined parameters.

Relate this back to cosmic and organic evolution and you can see thus;

[If] God created the Universe; [Then] via Infinity within the closed system (the totality of all energy matter and light and any other forces within our universe which has a horizon; I.e. the EM&amp;C flung furthest and ever moving from the original Big Bang‚Äîthink the farthest ripples of Space/Time) [And Through] ever increasing Entropy‚Äî&gt; [Then] we have: Perfect probability of Existence, which is based upon that Universal Truth equation expressed above.

In practical terms; all of the matter energy and light; the Universe; is a puzzle, and we, sentient life are created by God to solve it.

In certain forms of Buddhism, there is something called the ‚ÄúUniversal Vehicle‚Äù; I believe logically that we are meant to animate the Universe and use it as a vehicle to travel beyond our Universe horizon and continue infinitely.

Think the ending sequence of the original Men in Black‚Äîwhere is it is revealed our universe is simply a marble being played with  by a large alien; I see this infinity upwards and downwards (I.e there are universe in the quantum realm); and this also borne out in the Kybalion‚Äîa metaphysical text allegedly created by Herm√®s (wiki it for sure, but pay attention to the principles and not lore; ironically gender is discussed in a way relevant to trans folk such as myself).

And more globally; if all comes from God (personal or impersonal) Then all is part of the Universal Truth, and all is valid for some purpose‚ÄîOmnism is a good encapsulation if this principle.

And therefore as one family we should live in peace and love (Jesus philosophy is a key element here); our only enemy being organic death; in the pursuit of Universal Truth (and eventual Union with God‚Äîdon‚Äôt want to keep going since this is already quite long, but essentially at some point logically we would evolve beyond the material world to live as ‚Äúlight beings‚Äù within a superstructure of the Universe; at least if we do not self annihilate per the Fermi‚Äôs Paradox neg scenario); and all human thought and everything in the Universe has a role to play in the animation of the Universe towards Sentient purpose‚Äîwhich is the will of God, but which takes billions of years and a cycle of life and death on a scale which seems cruel to us, but has brought us from a type of ‚Äúhell‚Äù I.e. being animate but unable to think (think quantum particles, natural processes‚Äîand imagine those forces are ‚Äúalive‚Äù in the sense that they are animate at the molecular and classical levels‚Äîa sun for example burns fiercely) towards ‚Äúheaven‚Äù which is increasing awareness and enlightenment via technology and the accumulation of knowledge within the ‚ÄúHuman Hive‚Äù Super Organism.

2020-06-14 17:04:00,h8xgot,0,0,"Hi Reddit,

I am here because I need advice from trans people.
My brother just told my mom he ‚Äúmight be transgender‚Äù. I am here because I want to support him and be there for him but I just have some questions I‚Äôm not ready to ask him, I need to understand more.

Some background:
My brother is autistic (high functioning/mainly social issues) 
He‚Äôs been on anxiety and depression meds for years 
He‚Äôs gone to counselors and therapists for years 
They think he has other mental health issues they haven‚Äôt identified yet 
Is 19 and doesn‚Äôt have a job or go to school (he‚Äôs been ‚Äúlooking‚Äù for a job since January) 

Like I said, I want to support him. I am honestly so shocked and confused, and not in a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in denial‚Äù kind of way. In a he has literally never expressed any interest in feminine / girly / womanly things ever. Not once in his entire life. 
I am his sister and am a huge girly girl. I have always been. When we were little he never reached for my toys, he‚Äôs never gotten into mine or my moms makeup, our closets, nothing. Nothing to indicate any femininity. 
He had this huge beard that he refused to shave for like two years. Wore his khaki shorts and tshirts every day. 
My mom came to visit me for two weeks and when she got home he told her this. He had shaved his beard, she thought he was listening to his counselor about how he needs to look his best to get a job. 
He told her that he thinks he is trans and that he all the sudden cares about his weight and what he wears. She told him that‚Äôs usually what happens when you get older, you want to present your best imagine to the world.
He also said he‚Äôs not Interested in a sex change, just possible hormone therapy. 

Sorry for the rambling I‚Äôm just trying to put all the information out there. 

Google is not your friend when it comes to LGBTQ community questions. 
Has anyone ever experienced ‚Äúspontaneous gender dysphoria‚Äù? Could he really have been hiding it this whole time? Like I said, this is not an ‚Äúin denial‚Äù thing, this is a he has never shown any interest in ‚Äúopposite gender‚Äù things EVER.

I just want to understand and be as helpful as I can. Any experience that you can share would be helpful.

I have a friend who is a trans man who celebrates his HRT anniversaries by having ‚ÄúT parties‚Äù with tea and friends. I am currently writing a novel where I have multiple trans characters. One of them is a trans prince of a kingdom and while this is a fantasy novel that doesn‚Äôt center around him being trans, I want to put the ‚ÄúT party‚Äù thing in a scene. 

I didn‚Äôt question this at first because this is true to the lives of the trans people I know. However, I know that the trans community is made of diverse individuals with differing opinions and feelings. My friend himself said that I should reach out online because he doesn‚Äôt know many trans people besides himself and so he can‚Äôt say that what he does or feels is common. 

I am worried about ‚Äúothering‚Äù him from other characters or making his character seem to only comprise of the trait ‚Äútrans.‚Äù However, I also want a scene that shows his connection to his friends and a casual moment in the life of a trans person in between two huge witch-fighting plot scenes. 

So here I am to ask if it is a common thing for people to celebrate their HRT anniversaries. How do you feel about HRT anniversaries? Could you see trans people having these sorts of celebrations with loved one? Would you find it strange, problematic, or offensive in a novel?

2020-06-14 22:32:17,h93art,0,3,"Hello everyone! I'm going to apologize in advance for the following wall of text. I need to let it all out because it's just driving me insane. I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for. Validation and affirmation? Likely. Advice or help would be nice too.

How do people afford things in their life? There's people that make less than me and own more. I am struggling to afford necessities. Right now Im enjoying pua, but that has shed a huge light on just how little I was making before. Im getting almost double what I was when I was working. But that'll end  when July does, so I'm looking for a new job.

Thing is, seemingly nowhere pays anywhere near what I need. I have made a budget and I've crunched the numbers over and over with the same result. So lets break it down. My contractually obligated payments are $90/mo for my phone, $450/mo for my share of rent/utilities, and $125/mo for my laser hair removal. That's $665/mo right there. 

Then we have my sanity keepers, my entertainment that I need and shouldnt have to give up. $100/yr for microsoft office, $60/year for xbox live, and $15/mo rounded up for spotify. That's only $28.50/mo and I feel like that's not too much to ask for when it comes to entertainment. That brings my monthly total to $693.50.

Then my not-set-in-stone and fluctuating budget for food and gas. I plan on working in town again, and that's only going to cost me about $20/wk for gas. I've been spending about $150 every 2 weeks on groceries, but because of covid I have been ordering ALOT of doordash. I'm trying to ease off ordering and putting that money into groceries, so like $100/wk for food. That's $480/mo for food and gas. Montly total comes to $1,173.50. 

And that was okay with my last job bringing in $1,200/mo. 

But now that I'm transitioning, I've got makeup and clothes to consider. Hormones. I would love to get help from a personal trainer to get into a healthier frame of mind and get in shape. In my area, a personal trainer ranges from $35-75/wk. So lets say $50/wk. Montly total is now $1,373.50

Then we have my estimated payments. I currently am not paying for a car or insurance, as I'm borrowing my grandparents car and I'm covered by their insurance. They understand that money isnt easy and that's why they lended the car. But they have become increasingly annoying about me buying my own car and getting my own insurance. I understand why. I agree. Its just I dont have any money to buy a car, so I'll likely have to be suckered into one of those shitty high monthly payments for a crappy used car places. Based on how much some of my friends and family pay, I would imagine I would be looking at no less than $200/mo and upwards of $400/mo. Then insurance Im inputting what my brother pays. We're both male (I'm still presenting as such anyway), about a year difference in age, similar driving record, etc. He pays about $130-something/mo. Rounding up, lets say $150/mo. On the low end, that's $350/mo to give my grandparents car back. Monthly total is now $1,723.50.

And that's not even considering saving any money, paying back student loans and medical bills, wanting to go back to college, or at the very least, work on some certifications to help get a better job. Or saving for FFS and SRS if insurance wont cover it. Or therapy, which I think I need.

Factoring in taxes, I would need to make a minimum of $15/hr to cover everything. The only places that dont require a degree or years of experience that pay $15/hr around me are Amazon and Whole Foods, so Amazon. I'm never working for Amazon. So that leaves me stuck not knowing what to do. Nothing pays enough and I cant afford to improve my education or trade skills to get a better job. I thought about camming, I would be fine doing it. I'm just not happy with my body right now and would not feel good doing it right now.

I'm constantly stressing about money. I'm panicking that I'm never going to be able to fully transition and I'm never going to get to be a beautiful woman or feel pretty when I see myself in the mirror.

I wouldn't say I had a rough childhood, my parents are well off and I'm lucky to have them paying for all 4 years of my college tuition. That being said I've always viewed my parents as good financial parents, but never as someone I could emotionally connect to. They were extremely strict and have an extremely short temper. Most of my early memories revolve around them berrating and screaming at me, or having things of mine taken away (My laptop, door,  freetime to name a few). This ultimately lead to me being shy, timid, and having trust issues.

Now another characteristic of mine was that I had a weird relationship with clothes.  I was the kind of kid who outwardly hated anything other than t shirts, athletic shorts, and sweat pants. I outwardly refused to wear and shirts with buttons, collars, or jeans to name a few. However I secretly loved dressing up. When ever I could get a few moments of alone time, I'd dress up in formal attire. It started off with me wearing polo shirts, in elementary school and then full suits in middle school. Eventually in early-mid highschool the thought crossed my mind to crossdress. 

Before I delve into more detail in the crossdressing I want to explain more about me and my families beliefs. My family for one is religious, my mom being the kind if person to reference the bible in arguments. Another is that they are extremely conservative and hate ""the gays"" and even more specifically ""trannys"" as they describe it. Like many children our beliefs are often times influenced by our parents, and so for a long time I was deeply conservative. This lead to me having conservative friends both online and in real life.

Now back to the crossdressing. When I first did it I thought  nothing of it. Just thought of it as me dressing up. However the thought eventually dawned on me that I may be trans, and it angered and confused me. But I still kept dressing. It felt good to express myself in different ways and I came to possibly accept that I may be trans. However I eventually stopped after a only a few crossdressing attempts. I got scared of getting caught. I did not feel safe coming out to my parents, and so I closed that part of my life. I suppressed my thoughts of being trans and attributed them to some fetish and tried to completely forget.

Now the supression worked for the time being but with quarantine being what it is, I get a lot of time to think. With me (possibly) going to college in the fall I might have the opportunity to explore this part of myself. However I'm terrified of my parents finding out, and confused how I would even go about this. How could I try dressing up in secret. I wouldn't be able to explain why I have a skirt to my male roommate or the terrifying possibility of them walking in on me while dressed. Then I'm always terrified of my parents finding out. I'm not sure how they would, but my mind finds a way to justify it. Then comes the problem with what if I'm trans, the. I'm stuck waiting till I can afford hormones since I wouldn't be able to do that on my parents health care. More importantly I'm scared to even do those steps. I've never told anyone about my trans thoughts and am unsure if I ever could. This is all assuming I may be trans which I still doubt.

So growing up I didn't really know of trans people. I just new that girls who behaved in a more 'boyish' way were considered to be 'tomboys' and boys who behaved in a more 'girlish' manner were considered 'girly'. It was during my early teen years (13-14) when I came to learn about the LGBT community and I first heard of trans people. Well back then I didn't really bother so much to think about it I just thought of it this way: It's other peoples' lives and they can choose how they want to live so why should I bother. So I just accepted things the say they were and never questioned anyone why.

But recently I've been thinking, what makes one suddenly realise that they're meant to be of a different gender. I suppose the main reason I thought this way is cause my gender was never really that important to me so I never understood why people would make a big deal over their gender ? Like yeah I'm a girl but maybe it's because of how my parents never made me conform to gender norms so I never felt like I was meant to be a guy. I never heard the words 'dress like a girl' or 'sit like a girl', it was always dress decently and sit decently for religious reasons so I got to grow up wearing male clothes and having a 'not so girly personality'. Well the reason i'm saying this is because i used to think that the reason why people feel like they don't identify with their gender is because they're forced to identify with it? But watching documentaries and hearing people speak up about being a transgender made me realise that it's not as simple as that and it's a much more intense feeling than just not liking your gender? Well that brings me to my question of how people realise that theyre trans and why they feel that way.

Im more confortable with my body everyday, everyone in my life is completly suportive and day by day I sense less weird looks at me, and with the heart in my own hand, i want to say that I've even found love as a transgirl, I've just met the most wonderfull girl, my flower, my queen, my parter... she makes me feel alive and loved and she makes me want to be better.   \n\n\nEven if you feel alone, even if you feel that love is not for us, that we have to be alone... Love always finds the way. It may have to be between two transgirls more than 2000 km away, but it always flourish, and trust me, it would be worth it, it will be worth all the punishment we have to endure, all the rejection, all the hate, even from ourselves. Because one day you will see yourself in the mirror and you will be proud of all the journey you have at your back."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I just want to say that i cannot say thank you enough, and I feel like im the threshold of my full happiness', 'created': 1592263120.0}"

I've recently completed an advanced university course in History of Sex, as well as second year psychology, and I had the unfortunate opportunity to see a recent terf's post on reddit trying to compare body dysmorphia and gender dysmorphia.

As a survivor of anorexia - for people to to try and compare my experience to a trans person (WHICH I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I HAVE CIS PRIVILEGE) is beyond horrific - this gross fucking comparison made me want to throw up. namely, they mentioned: ""delusional body modification aspirations, secrecy and disclosure, tips and tricks, and grooming.""

I have NEVER been so fucking disgusted on behalf of myself and my friends that suffer from EDs. what a creepy way to try and confirm your transphobia. I honestly don't have any more words. I'm just really done with this shit.

I saw someone saying on the gender critical sub that the fact that they had body dysmorphia in their early teen years proved that their gender dysmorphia was false and ""that's how they knew they were actually cis."" Psychologically, these two concepts of dysmorphia have ZERO correlation to one another.

For a while, I (16M) have had a lot of uncertainties about my gender and sexuality. Early in my teen years I started thinking about boys the same way I had thought about girls for some time. This feeling has only gotten stronger and stronger over the duration of my pubescence.

When I was 14 I came to the realization that I'm most likely bisexual and came out to my mom a year later, last summer. She was supportive of me just as she's always been. Her only concern was about the possibility of never having any grandkids. I haven't told my dad yet, whom I live with. He is a bit more conservative and I don't know if he'd take it too well. I've also told a couple of my friends who luckily don't mind.

Even before coming out I had also had another feeling. I have, for a couple of years now, felt like I don't belong in my body entirely. I've started liking ""girly"" things. I'm talking about being transgender. This feeling has, much like my bi-ness, only gotten stronger. I'm to the point now that I'm thinking about transitioning, but I'm not completely sure.

My urge to change gender might also come from my huge lack of confidence in how I look. I feel like transitioning might ""fix"" the way I look. Also some days I DO feel like I'm a guy and then some I don't. Does this mean I'm non-binary/genderqueer? I don't want to transition and regret it in my adult years, but I also feel like if I wait too long, transitioning won't be as easy. I'm currently working up the courage to come out to my mom, but I'm not sure if I dare.

Sorry for wall of text.

TLDR: Am bi male and possibly trans.
h e l p

As for being trans and transitioning MTF, I have a few questions:

Should I wait until I'm completely sure about transitioning?

Is there a proper age range to start the transitioning process?

How and when should I come out? Who to?

How does one start transitioning (in Finland/Europe)?

Could it be just a phase?

Could I actually be non-binary/genderqueer?

anyways, i'm having a problem with what i'm assuming is gender dysphoria. i've felt this way for a long time and i've never talked to anybody about it, so why not discuss it with strangers on reddit? everyday i daydream about being male, and i frequently get to the point of tears when i think about the possibility that i might never be a male and i will be stuck in this stupid girl body forever. i've researched bottom and top surgeries countless times, and i think that i would be so much happier in a male body.

i'm not just, like, a transtrender, right? how do i know that i'm not being influenced by the media around me? i think about this often, and i'm too scared to talk to any of my friends and family about it.

A quick round up looks like this, I (male) was in therapy for 2 years because during my childhood, roughly 20 years back, my parents fucked up a lot of my values and I ended up with a serious case of depression. I know that my parents implanted during that time that girls do better in school, look prettier, are easier kids, and other questionable values. And for over 10 years I have been drawn to my female side, that includes feelings, visuals, behaviour, etc. Being and looking more female makes me calm and happy. And while I don't hate my genitals, I can't even remember when I looked at the mirror and thought that I liked how I looked or acted as a male. 

Therapy taught me, that nothing just exists, it has roots in your past, but I'd rather not go through a hefty process of transitioning just to figure out that I have yet to fix more baggage from my past instead of finding happiness. Can anyone share a bit of insight whether their wish to transition just appeared out of thin air, or whether a less severe fucked up childhood is a good reason not to pursue this? I'll take it to a therapist, if I am convinced enough, but 4 months of waiting time until you get a spot is not something I'll take lightly

First off let's preface this with I'm mft.... or atleast I think I am

It all started when I was 11 and I used to play with my moms makeup when I was alone, though that sounds like a misnomer.... I just happened to be alone when I did it, i would do that cause i thought it was normal so then i would try on some of her clothes (just tops and skirts) and it felt right. Like this is what I was supposed to be doing cause it was natural for me. There was nothing sexual about it, it just felt correct. Well my dad caught on and I had to go in hiding. Like extreme hiding and I hated it. Well fast foreward to highschool and though I ""looked like a man"" I still put lip gloss when I went to school back in '04 I was 17 and a junior. Not much happened but I was able to hide it rather well from my dad who never said a thing to me. During the next 13 years I try not to look in mirrors for longer than I have to cause I have hated the sight of my maleness since I was about 12. Ok hated is too strong, it just.... doesnt look right, I can deal as long as I dont have to look at it for any length of time ya know??

Now fast foreward to when I turned 24, my parents divorced and my dad left me to take care of my mom. I decided i was just a crossdresser and i got me a couple pieces and was happy. But as i kept wearing the same outfit i wanted more, so then i grew my wardrobe and started social media for ""her"" under the name andrea and I was ""content"" with that, I found it tolerable. Got dressed up whenever I could but would always hide cause I didnt want any drama about it. My mom knew I crossdressed but that's what I wanted her to know. Not how deep it went and right before I turned 30 I finally go to go out for the first time and I went out into the city and went shopping fully femme. I was so happy that I was referred to as ma'am and she and I over heard a couple of people talk about ""her"" clothing. But i was mostly ignored lol and for about 2 years after that I couldnt do anything else, I had to play the role of a man cause of some family obligations I had uphold.

But this year in 2020 I have been slowly comming out to more people that I know and adding them to my social media and they even refer to me in feminine too, i also started a vlog on youtube. But then in a previous post I told about a friend of the family I came out to telling my mom and ever since then it almost like I feel like she is questioning the validity my confession. 

The point to this long post is.  I'm begining to doubt it myself, is this normal? Does anyone else go through doubt and questioning?

Here's a short transcript of the conversation in case anyone struggles to find the words when asked similar questions, or they just want to hear how it went for me. 
I was shaking the whole time (as always) but quarantine has built it up to a point where I couldn't take being deadnamed anymore. 


The summary: 


Her: ""I just don't understand."" 
Me: ""I wish you did understand, but there are many aspects of life and of people that we don't understand, but it's important we respect and continue on anyway sometimes."" 

Me: ""Every time you use that name it feels so disrespectful.""
Her: ""Disrespectful! How? I respect you as a human.""
Me: ""By not respecting someone's identity, you cannot respect them wholely""

Her: ""I wish I knew when it happened, when you lost who you were and -""
Me: ""I never lost who I am. I never became someone different. I could ask you when you decided you weren't going to put up with (thing going on) anymore, and there's likely no one point but a build up of a lifetime of it. People constantly grow and develop, as all we are is a culmination of our experiences and actions. I have always been who I am, and I am always growing and developing.""

Her: ""It seems when you're around certain people you feel this need to say something more:
Me: ""no, that need is always there. it's just scary to say something. What happened is I've been in quarantine for months now, and that's all I hear from you. I have no escape of spending 9 hours a day with people in the city that know my name."" 

Her: ""Why is it scary?""
Me: ""I think I'm afraid of the rejection""
Her: ""I would never reject you as a person, this is one part of a whole""
Me: ""My identity is the only thing I have. That's all we have in this life.""

It's been such a weird and uncomfortable road. Right now, my family is completely against me being trans is trying to ease me back into my birthname, feminine pronouns, not binding/packing, etc, it's been really really hard. 

In a nutshell, my phyciatrist's philosophy is that if there's any chance to avoid being trans then that's what you should choose. So apparently, there was a chance I could avoid being trans so here we are. I'm so numb, and when I'm not I'm just miserable. I've cut off ties with  all my friends bc my parents think that they're influencing me into not wanting to be a girl. That and I've been so depressed and just haven't been talking to anyone if I can avoid it. Even before the quarantine I wouldn't (and still don't) let anyone get close because of what was going on. 

Today I told my phyciatrist that I was suicidal and that I had a plan because I was so uncomfortable with the changes I was seeing with my body (I just came off hormone blockers) and with the pronouns and name stuff and his response was to ""just be happy."" I have to choose to be happy, and I see what he's saying, like you have to want to get better. I don't want to have to go through the hardships of being a trans person if I can avoid it, but the problem is that I don't think I can. I don't think I have a choice right now. I'm so confused. I know that my dysphoria (or whatever I have) isn't as bad as other trans people and I know that I didn't have a lot of the early childhood signs. But I also know that right now my body feels like a cage, and the sex-related changes I'm seeing make me want to tear off my own skin. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I don't have anyone that will listen to me right now or just try to help me. I'm sure my phyciatrist is just doing what he feels is best, but right now I feel like I'm in a really dangerous spot. Tbh, writing this is the only thing keeping me from getting up and downing all my pills.

Dear Boris Johnson, 

  
I write to you regarding the distressing proposals put forward by Equalities Minister Liz Truss. Namely the proposal to ban transgender people from public bathrooms and the proposal to prevent trans youth from accessing hormone blockers. 

  
I will argue against the former first as the flaws in this proposal are numerous.   
A non-exhaustive list of why this is would not be helpful may include:  
‚óè A ban from public bathrooms is a ban from public life, as it would be impossible to attend work or education if trans people are to return home every time they need to use the facilities.   
‚óè In many cases, it is very difficult to determine who is trans and who is cis. At this point in my transition, I look, sound and act just like any cis (not trans) woman. The only way to prevent a woman like me from using the women‚Äôs bathroom would be to sexually assault every woman going to a public bathroom with invasive genital checks and even then, with Gender Confirmation Surgery (CGS), not even that would be sufficient in enforcing this proposal.   
‚óè DNA testing could not be used even if DNA tests were fast enough for when you‚Äôre desperate to visit a public restroom, as about 1 in 80,000 cis women have XY chromones \[1\].  
‚óè If people are forced to use the restroom of the sex they were assigned at birth, trans men, who often look, sound, smell and act like cis men, would be forced to use the women‚Äôs bathroom. Any predatory man could just pretend to be a trans man, making it easier than ever for men to gain access to women‚Äôs spaces.   
‚óè A man who has made up his mind to rape will not be deterred by the fact he is not allowed in a certain area. Sexual assault is already illegal, we do not have to harm minorities to make it so.   
‚óè No trans person, or person claiming to be trans has ever been arrested for misconduct in a women‚Äôs space within the US \[2\]. I was unable to find official figures from the UK, however, I was also unable to find a single instance of such an occurrence in the UK reported by a reputable source. Of course, you would have better access to this data than I do so I beg that you check for yourself.

  
In summation, women would not be made safer by banning trans people from bathrooms. Life would become more difficult and dangerous for trans people which would be the only significant outcome of the proposed legislation.

  
The second proposal is more complicated to argue against since it requires an understanding of: the damage a ‚Äònormal‚Äô puberty can do to a trans person, both physically and mentally, the effects of the treatment, and the proof we have that it improves the lives of trans people.

  
The argument against allowing trans youth to take hormone blockers usually goes something along the lines of ‚Äòteenagers aren‚Äôt responsible enough to make decisions that will affect them for the rest of their lives so why let them delay puberty‚Äô. 

  
I would argue that the decision to allow puberty is also a decision and, in the case of trans people, invariably the wrong one. 

  
For example, trans men who do not take blockers will, at some point require a double mastectomy whereas trans men who take blockers will not. Trans women who do not take blockers will experience changes to the skeletal structure that will take decades for HRT to undo as well as hair growth that will require painful laser hair removal. These problems will not be experienced by trans women who took blockers before the onset of puberty. If, with time, a child determines with their doctor that they are not actually transgender, they may simply come off the prescription to resume their ‚Äònormal‚Äô puberty process. 

  
We can also show that the steps we currently take in treating trans youth with puberty blockers are effective and beneficial.

  
A wealth of scientific data exists around this topic but in brief:  
‚óè A study into the effects of GCS in 16 to 18 years olds concludes ‚ÄòNot a single subject expressed feelings of regret concerning the decision to undergo sex reassignment.‚Äô \[3\]   
‚óè A study into the effects of HRT and GCS on people who started blockers at ‚Äòmean age, 13.6 years‚Äô\[4\] and HRT at ‚Äòmean age, 16.7 years‚Äô concludes that ‚Äòpuberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults.‚Äô \[4\]  
‚óè A study on the effects of puberty blockers administered to transgender children between the ages of 12 and 16 states ‚ÄòBehavioural and emotional problems and depressive symptoms decreased, while general functioning improved significantly during puberty suppression.‚Äô \[5\]

  
The above studies, among many others, use evidence-based medicine to support providing young trans patients with the puberty blockers they need. 

  
Removing trans youths‚Äô access to treatment is the denial of a chance at a normal life. 

  
In conclusion, I would suggest that you consider a Minister for Women and Equalities that will make life more equitable for transgender individuals, rather than Liz Truss, a woman who is clearly supporting the removal of legal protections of minorities.

  
Yours sincerely,

In my opinion that's way too much time especially when a person is 100% sure of their condition and has been sure for years, AND the changes that hormones create aren't even noticeable for the first few months so they could be easily reversed if someone were to truly regret it, which seems to be the reason for the gatekeeping (that they don't want to deal with people wanting to de-transition). 

So I'm interested to hear how other nations around the world handle transition and if she's truly correct in the ""procedure everywhere"" argument.

This one is gonna be a lot lol. Content warning for transphobia, shitty parents and relationship stuff. 

So I'm almost 20 y/o, nb transmasc, living at home during quarantine. I'm an only child with a very overprotective mother. Said overprotective mother also tends to be transphobic and sometimes just queerphobic in general. I am not out to her as trans, but she knows that I am bi/pan. Accepting me as not straight took a long time for her an and of itself (she spent most of my high school years telling me it was a phase, but now is all right with me being queer as long as I'm not ""in your face"" about it. this basically means that I'm not supposed to talk about it unless expressly asked). 

Of course, most of my friend group at college is made up of other trans and nb people. I think I have about three cis friends. This means that bringing friends over to my house is always interesting to say the least; I have to basically plead with my mother to gender my friends correctly and remind her that trans people aren't just delusional. 

Recently, my girlfriend came over for a socially distanced visit. We were outside, wore masks the whole time, etc. My mother did not at the time know that she was my girlfriend; I introduced her as a friend. This was mostly because my mother is just very overbearing when it comes to my dating relationships in general, not because I thought she'd be horribly transphobic about it. My mom was nice enough to my girlfriend, making an effort to use the right pronouns. 

The next day, I told my mother that I hadn't been completely honest with her about our relationship. I told her how things really were between me and my girlfriend, and my mother immediately vehemently disapproved. This, of course, came with a lot of transphobic/transmisogynistic comments about my girlfriend. My mother even went so far as to ask the stereotypical ""how do trans people have sex?"". Yep.

I obviously am not going to end things with my girlfriend over this. I love her more than I care about my mother's outdated opinions. My girlfriend has also agreed that she wants to continue this relationship. We were both pretty upset over it initially, but we're just pissed off now. Right now I'm just trying to get financially independent ASAP (I already have money saved, but need to save more before I can truly afford to be on my own). With how overprotective my parents are, I can't just leave (they're the kind that would hunt me down, be emotionally and verbally abusive, etc). Does anyone have any advice? 

tl;dr: my mother is being horribly transphobic towards my girlfriend. it's not possible for me to leave her house immediately, but i am trying to leave as soon as it is safe. does anyone have any advice?",trans,My mom disapproves of my relationship with my girlfriend because she's openly trans,1592453640.0,"{'created_utc': 1592428440, 'id': 'hb0afa', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Hey everyone! \n\nThis one is gonna be a lot lol.

So I‚Äôm completely new to this sub Reddit so sorry if this doesn‚Äôt actually go here‚Ä¶ my bad. I‚Äôm also new to the trans thing so sorry if I say anything really stupid sorry again...


Okay so first off I‚Äôd like to thank you for reading and taking the time out of your busy day! Secondly I know this kind of thing is a really big deal for some people. They don‚Äôt feel right in their own bodies and suffer from horrible depression.

Well I‚Äôm not exactly like that. I‚Äôm a guy that‚Äôs thinking about transitioning into a woman. But I don‚Äôt hate being male. I would have picked to be a female if I had the choice but hey it‚Äôs not the worst thing in the world for me. I‚Äôm not depressed and there‚Äôs no rush for me to figure this out.

So even as a little kid I‚Äôve wanted to be a girl. I always wanted to wear girly clothes and make up. I hear normally kids grow out of that sort of thing but I‚Äôm 19 now and still feel the same way.

I‚Äôm pretty submissive when it comes to sex but I‚Äôm not interested in dudes. I‚Äôm really into anal even though I just started with my first dildo but I just do not like men in that way. Okay so it‚Äôs actually more complicated than that but basically I can‚Äôt be romantic with a man.

I think women are freaking beautiful!!! I‚Äôm super jealous of them. I really want to be like them. The hips, tights, butt, lips, chest, clothes, jewelry, make up, the aesthetic all of it is super appealing to me.

I‚Äôm in pretty good shape. I work out regularly and am pretty health conscious. I have a skinny build now. I consider myself pretty lucky to be so close to an hourglass figure already. My dad is a pretty big guy muscle wise but he does a lot more weight training then I do. I mainly just run with some light body weight exercises. I‚Äôm pretty tall at 5‚Äô11‚Äù  and I‚Äôve been told I have broad shoulders but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything too crazy.

So if I were to transition I would want to go all the way. Shaving all my body hair getting my voice to change. I'd even want some breasts. I would want there to be no doubt that I was a woman. The only thing I wouldn't touch would be my penis and balls. From what I hear that stuff is pretty complicated and I won‚Äôt mind keeping it anyway. I think I'd also be more of a switch sexual if I transitioned. Just something about the idea of being a woman makes me more comfortable with being a little more dominant in bed yeah know?

However! I know pretty much nothing about how to start, hormone treatment, breast implants, the effectiveness and side effects of these kinds of things. Yeah I‚Äôm pretty new‚Ä¶


My parents are‚Ä¶ not the most open people‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not financially independent from them and they kind trans people are kind of weird. But they love me deeply and they once said if I were to come out as gays that they wouldn‚Äôt hate me so‚Ä¶ there's that!

My grandparents are both Christian but they‚Äôre actually very caring and thoughtful people. They are strongly against violence towards the lgbt community or anyone for that matter. I think they'd be a little wired out at first but would see I would still be me and get used to it.

My friends would probably be a little off-put but would get over it pretty quickly.

So‚Ä¶ sorry this was written weird I‚Äôm just trying to get some points across you know. Well what do you think? Should I transition? Wait? Start slow? Any tips or info about treatment I should know? Maybe some good research resources?

It's brought up briefly that she was AMAB, mostly in the context that chose her name, Kina. I guess I just wanted to know some of the things some trans people would like to see in a story featuring a character with the same identity. And what are some things you would like to see less of?  \n\nOne of my best friends is a trans lesbian, just like Kina. Of course I'm going to ask her input, but I want to develop this character and story a little more first. (Also, I'm super insecure about my writing, so it's difficult for me to talk about it with my friends and easier to discuss with strangers online.)"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Writing a trans character?', 'created': 1592513177.0}"

2020-06-18 15:28:50,hbgs09,0,3,"My name is Skylar.  

This is what I know.  

Time only gets you so far.  

Time only takes you to some places.  Sometimes, we need to do the work.    

 Sometimes I shorten my name to Sky, for a number of reasons. The sky is a wide-open place, a place to be free in, a place where we dream, and a place where we can live. I dream of soaring above the clouds, driven by wind, able to look down, and see that the world is bigger than anything I've ever imagined. I can't conceive what it is like for a bird to watch the world go by beneath oneself, to watch what happens as the wind picks you up, sweeps you away, and takes you to where you want to be.  

There are obstacles to this. For the bird, they come in many forms. There are other birds, stronger winds, airplanes, severe weather, exhaustion. For trans people, there are so many more. Constant, systemic oppression and denial of our rights, suppression of the medical procedures that we need, conversion of our suffering into ""attention-seeking fetishists"", unending hatred and venom coming from the mouths of those we love, the uncertainty that comes with knowing that your life will never be yours unless you willingly put yourself through all of this pain. We fear to go outside of our homes even in the best of times, and for some, we fear the people inside of our homes as well. We deal with it being a victory when we are granted protection in the workplace, instead of it being a basic right. We fear for our lives if we do anything. We can't write, we can't talk, we can't argue, for fear of murder in the streets. Being transgender is, far too often, a death sentence.

We are constantly pressured by society to conform. That's the thing I hate. We always have to do this, or do that, or go here, or learn that. We're told we have to be a certain way, that if we aren't, we aren't enough, that we aren't worth anything. This view is toxic. It drives home the point that you are just supposed to be normal, to fit in.  

What if you don't?  

You are persecuted for being who you are, for expressing yourself. You can't find a place. So instead, you try to compensate. You try to hide. You put yourself through endless agonies because you are afraid of what will happen. You torment yourself with visions of what you want and what you need. You can't understand who or what you are. 

 There are voices in the back of our heads. You know of your conscience. You've heard it reprimand you for your morally incorrect actions. There's another. It's the voice of that part of your mind. The part that you try not to listen to but it creeps into your darkest dreams and deepest slumbers. It's your doubts. We all have doubts. They keep us centered and grounded. But the doubt that this is is much deeper. It holds down your worst fears and makes them real. You dream of what you want, and then it ends. Your doubt and your hatred creep in to fill its place. It's an impossibility, they say. It can't be done. You're just lying to yourself.   

We float alone on an island, unanchored in the ocean of our sorrow and desperation. We live for the simple things. The quiet reassurance of a friend, the mere touch of a partner, fearing that we will lose everything if we let our guard down. We can never truly relax. We know that horrible things can and will happen if we slip up in our facade for even one moment.

We are condemned from birth, compelled to stay as we are by society, and left unknowing of what and of who we are. As soon as we find out, we do everything in our power to change back, to try to be ourselves.  

People say that being transgender is ""unnatural"", that it's ""against God's will"". That's bullshit. Either you're just not listening to reason, or you're just ignorant. All you are doing in saying that is driving trans people closer and closer to suicide, by providing a world in which they see no other option. You are adding to our own fears, that we are broken, that we are wrong, that we are mistaken. It takes every ounce of our own will power and more courage than you can imagine to be out as transgender.  

You say that we can't just change or gender, because you don't get to choose it. Let me explain what we are truly doing. The pain of knowing that your body is not your own, that you have been born wrong, that you are, in effect, defective, is unimaginable. We find that pain and do everything that we can to relieve it, but it is lifelong. We are just trying to live as we should be.

Why do you care so much? All we are doing is living our lives. You, however, insist on making that as difficult as possible. You insist on us not getting an equal chance to live or to speak. You're preaching hatred in the name of a god who stands for love and peace and acceptance.  

You have corrupted people's views so much, all the way to the point of me being afraid for my life if people find out who wrote this. That's not okay. This world that you have created has teenagers afraid for their lives and livelihoods for something that they can't control, and something they would change in a heartbeat if they could. In denying us what we need to transition, you deny yourselves the chance to get us away from you. 

&amp;#x200B;

 So now I speak to all the parents of transgender, and LGBTQIA+ kids in general. Stop repressing a crucial piece of the person you love. Stop denying them things that could save their lives. Listen to them, understand them, and accept them.

I belong to a mostly cis-gendered women's circle that discussed the divine feminine, feminism and all things femme related including mothering, menstruation, violence etc.

It is a very uplifting community that truly helps a lot of cis gendered women to find self empowerment, and gives them many opportunities of employment, teaching, mentoring, housing etc.

However, there is one very key issue here, although the group fully accepts trans women, and all of the spaces are inclusive and diverse, the cis gendered women in this group take a big exception to labelling themselves as cis.

They are happy to label trans women as women, and treat them on the same level as the women in the group but do not want to define themselves as cis. They believe it to be limiting to both trans women and themselves.

Is this terf like behaviour, anti trans? Or is this acceptable? I have been asked to do a talk on trans history and how the circle can open itself up to be more inclusive but I am torn. I would love some feedback from trans people on whether you think it is acceptable for these women to have this pov or if it is veiled transphobia.

I've been thinking about my *gender identity* for a few years now and it keeps transforming and evolving into different things, basically it's very *fluid* and so are my wants concerning my body but they're so fluid I wouldn't want to do something I'd *regret* later.

Photo album/story

My GF and I semi-spontanously decided to take a trip up to Montreal for NYE weekend, and I would present as me, for the first time publicly, the whole weekend. It was especially symbolic to me because NYE was, to the day, one year from when I allowed myself to begin questioning and working through my gender identity problems. The idea was to visit a faraway liberal city, with no fear of knowing anybody and get to be me for the first time ever without consequence. 

Though occasionally stressful, it was an amazing experience that cemented the reality of my need to transition prior to starting HRT (it also made getting a letter from my therapist very straightforward) and I hope to make more wonderful mini-vacations with my GF when the pandemic situation dies down.

Whenever somebody came out as trans and told me to call them in a dif way, I did, I'm not an ass, but I always had the thoughts, more like questions, that I didnt understood so I hope someone can clear this up for me.

¬øWhat is feeling like a woman?, ¬øwhat is feeling like a man?

Since I was little I had the idea that I was a girl because of my body, but once I matured a little I discovered people that felt different.

But, ¬øhow does it feel?, whenever I see the explanations of it its ""I wanted to wear dresses and femenine things, hangout with girls, put on makeup, made me feel cute"" or the opposite, ""I wanted to have short hair, dress more masculine, hangout with dudes, made me feel manly""

And thats exactly what loses me, ¬øweren't all of those thing social constructs?, I thought it was okay to break them, because nobody is into a ""mold"", that it didnt change your gender because it was what antiquated society told you to do.

You see, I'm not femenine or masculine, wich made me think when I was 11, (after coming out as a lesbian), ""¬øwhat if I'm transgender?"", so with my friends we decided to experiment and call all eachother diferently for a week, but nothing mattered, femenine or masculine pronouns it was all the same, nothing felt diferent, nothing was diferent other than the fact that I was being called a he.

Then, if gender isnt sex, isnt what we like, then, ¬øwhat is gender?, because if gender doesnt exist, ¬øthen why is transexuality a thing?

That was what broke my theory of gender not existing, and it made no sense, ¬øwhat is gender other than calling people in a way?

Then my mom told me ""Its not about being femenine or masculine, we all aren't completely femenine and masculine, its a soul found in the wrong body""

¬øSouls arent genderless?, that didnt made any sense, because then male souls would only reincarnate as male, and the same with female, ¬øwouldnt a better way to reach enlightment be to experience every perspective?, ¬ønot limiting experiences?

¬øAnd if they dont believe in anything of this?

Thanks for reading, it got a little long, I hope somebody can help me with this, and maybe make a better person or something.

A little about me, first. My name is Casey Lynn, and I'm a 26 year old, MtF trans woman from Manchester, New Hampshire. I currently work in a local restaurant as a Managing Chef, and live with a roommate (the only person currently in my state aware that I am trans) who is wonderfully supportive of me. I had my ""Aha!"" moment in late 2018, after several years of questioning my identity, and mislabeling myself several times over. As much as I *wish* I could tell you that I've been living happily in my newfound identity since then, well..  


I haven't, really. I've struggled for the last almost two years now, trying to find a ""comfort zone"" if you will, in regards to coming out, and presenting myself publicly as a woman. When I first began this journey, I was in a safe space and I was dating someone who was hugely supportive of my transition, and had even come out to my employer, that rapidly changed; While I moved to a place where I was equally supportive, the living situation was chaotic, and I felt almost too stressed to function, so I regressed a ton. The next living situation after that was *not* a safe environment, and so the regression completed itself until I was back to presenting solely as a male, and had gone back on my progress almost entirely.  My relationship with the only person who knew me as ***me,*** also ended, and I ended up moving again.  


That brings us to the now. I'm finally in a safe space where I feel I'm able to come back out of my turtle shell, and begin this process again. However, The more thought I put into it, the more I'm finding myself afraid of taking steps forward. I began presenting at home, my roommate calls me by my preferred pronouns, and supports me even on my 'lazy' days, when I do not present at all. I'm also dating an amazing girl who herself is trans, and supports every decision that I make. My struggles right now are getting past the initial coming out to others. With some its easy, like my roommate and my girlfriend. But with others, like my family and work? I'm so incredibly afraid of the backlash. My family is LGBTQ+ friendly, however my mother has made a habit of invalidating my mental health issues as ""made up"" or attention seeking, always passing the validity to another person, and accusing me of lying despite having been diagnosed. My work is.. Well, most kitchens are not exactly the most friendly of places, and my current employer has only ever known me as a ""male"", and I'm incredibly afraid that my coming out and beginning to present will impact my career in an irreversible way.  


I know this was a bit long-winded, but I've been devoid of any sort of outlet for these things in the last year or so. If you've made it this far, thank you so much for coming to my TED Talk!

I have to do a final assessment for my makeup course, and for it I have to pick a theme that means something to me and is currently trending, and come up with a final design that reflects the topic. 
I've chosen trans-pride; because even though I'm not transgender myself, I find personal growth in myself thanks to the trans community. I believe that I'm a better person now than I used to be- because of the transgender people who have opened my mind in the best way just by talking to me and being themselves. 

My questions are:

I'm just going through a tough time and I want to share my story and my thoughts.

I first realised I was a girl when I was going through puberty. I felt uncomfortable with the changes I was going through. Hated how I looked and sounded. 

By the time I was in my early twenties I was utterly miserable. I'd spend most of my time with female friends and in my mind pretend I was just one of the girls. It was nice but also difficult, I'd be jealous of their clothes and relationships with guys.

I guess it was obvious to at least one of them as she took pity on me. I'd come round hers for girly nights and we had a good laugh. She eventually bought me my first ever dress. I was so excited and would often wear it if I was home alone, which wasn't often as I still lived with my parents at the time.

It wasn't long before my secret was found in my drawers by my Mum. She confronted me confused, shocked and a little scared. 
Instead of coming out and telling her I wanted to be a girl so bad I dressed as one in private, I lied and told her it was a joke gift. She was less than amused and threw out the dress. 

Needless to say I was devastated and I retreated into the closet for a little over a decade. By which time I was married with a child. 
Struggling to come to terms with being a father I broke down and told my wife my secret. 
She was shocked but seemed supportive. Urging me to seek professional help with my issues and I did.

After a few months seeing a psychologist talking out my issues and even attending appointments in dresses, make up and later a wig. I decided to finally leap another hurdle. Coming out to my family.

I invited my mother over for tea with the express purpose of breaking the news to her. In the end I just broke down and cried in the bathroom while my wife told her. She was shocked but supportive and she broke the news to my Dad. Both of them seemed emotionally shattered by the revelation and things got quiet while they said they came to terms with it.

I was so uncomfortable, not knowing if I should discuss it or stay quiet about it but in the end they came back to it. Unfortunately they withdrew there support and I was left heart broken and confused. My wife agreed with there sentiments and I once again pushed the girl into the closet. Thinking that this time it would be forever.

But who you are never goes away. I'm still Fluer but sadly not in the light of the day. Only in my heart, mind and online. I moonlight as a trans woman to stay sane but at times it hurts me so much that I can barely stand it. Right now is one of those times. I want to be free but I can't and it's killing my soul slowly.

To any of you who like me hide there true identity for the sake of others. I love you and I support you. To those of you out and proud, I love you too because it makes me so happy to see people being free and true to themselves.

2020-06-19 14:15:56,hc1g1n,1,4,"I came out to them around 5 years ago. I had done a lot of research and watched a ton of videos about how to talk to your parents and stuff. One in particular was meant to be shown to someone's parents and talked about a lot of things i knew i never would be able to verbalize. I liked it so much i downloaded it and subtitled it so my parents could understand (it was in english and they don't speak it).  

They did not take it well, and when i offered to show them the video my mom literally said ""i don't want to see it. I don't want to know anything about this."".

At that point i realized i would never be their son. I wasn't out to the world (still am not) but i understood that i would lose my parents as soon as i decided i would not accept being seen as a girl anymore. It delayed my coming out greatly. I was in college and got scared that they would stop supporting me financially and i would end up a homeless drop out with no future. I promised myself i would come out when i had a stable job in my field and no sooner.

I have not spoken to my parents about being trans ever since. For the past 5 years we have basically just been pretending nothing happenned. 

I did promise myself i would never pretend to be something i am not again and i dress exactly how i want to, i use my binder regularly and keep my hair short. I don't look like a girl. My whole life i was always ""mistaken"" for a boy and passing comes very easily to me. 

Although i never verbally spoke about being trans to them again, i made a point of making it clear that i'm a man, through not pretending to be anything else. My mom tried to fight it a little, by offering me make up, jewelry, etc, all things i haven't used since i started being able to dress myself. Before i came out she had already accepted that i was a tomboy and stopped pushing this sort of stuff on me, coming out caused her to return to those old habits for a bit, but she mostly gave up on it again shortly.

Yesterday, she was driving me to the bus station and we were just talking about random things when she said it. It wasn't planned or anything. It was just a slip of the tongue. Honestly i would have thought i was just hearing what i wanted if it wasn't for the awkward second that followed. We didn't even acknowledge it, apart from that one second, just kept the conversation like nothing happenned.

Still. I can not begin to describe how i felt. The fact that it was a slip of the tongue just made it even better, because it feels like proof that she does see who i am even if she tries to deny it. It feels like a win, one that i desperately needed.

I have no doubt that she's going to keep fighting against it for as long as she can, but now i can be reasonably sure that i'm not going to lose my mom over this. It's just a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. She'll never understand how much this meant to me.

However when i moved and gained access to the Internet i didn't have before this and spoke to others through games and websites which opened a view and well i felt fitting a place where I was acknowledged as to who i was and not the uncertainty i had the last 19 years.

Now pretty much 4 years later nothing has changed i still feel it my life is all over the place and i keep putting it off till when its not. which unfortunately for my mental health hasn't.

Medical issues and Medication that enhances Testosterone as a side effect has turned me into some kinda sasquatch hairy and ugh.

I just don't know, I can't begin to understand what that would be like, I never presented myself as feminine to anyone ever because I know my sex is male so I should act like it, nobody ever suspected me to be not male. I also think about if it'd be better were I a born girl to begin with, would I want to just be a girl or would I be in a similar situation compared to this one?

My sexuality doesn't make things clear either, I'm bi (closeted). I may just be scared of people like always, either way it's really fucking me up mentally.

Then there's the body dysphoria, I don't like bodily hair, especially the hair on my legs and the area in between is bothering me.

I have a lot of body dysphoria, I wish I was more masculine, I wish I had a flat chest and deep voice (my voice is what gets me the most, I can't stand sounding like a woman because that's not what my voice sounds like in my mind, and it gives me whiplash every time I open my mouth and hear myself). Seeing my body makes me deeply uncomfortable, I wish it could be androgynous. Sometimes I want to be read as male, but sometimes I want to read as a woman/ want people to use she pronouns etc. So I guess my dysphoria waxes and wanes, but at the very worst I want to be 100% male, and at the very best I still want to be an androgynous woman? I've felt like this since I was a teenager and I started puberty, maybe even younger, when I was little I always fantasized about being boy characters from books and cartoons and whatnot. I've been wearing a tight sports bra to bind my chest most of the time for the last two years. Its not as much about how other people perceive me than that having a flat chest makes me feel more physically comfortable. I think my ideal transition would be going on Testosterone temporarily to lower my voice a little, possibly getting top surgery (although I'm a little unsure), and having people alternate she and he pronouns (even though I know that parts pretty unlikely to actually be respected).

Its true that I didn't identify as trans until I found out about it on the internet, but I mean, who didn't?

I was hoping to get some guidance. I‚Äôve never come out to friends and family about the way I feel and am also terrified at people I know recognizing me on here.

It‚Äôs in the past year that I‚Äôve started experimenting with crossdressing. 

When I dress up it isn‚Äôt necessarily sexual in nature. I just do normal stuff around my home(read a book, work, watch a movie), while dressed up. That being said, I always feel a great sense of calm after getting dressed up. 

How do I navigate these feelings?

Do these feelings and behaviours suggest I might be trans? Something else?

When I was young, I wanted to be a girl. Every role playing game, I played women adventurers.  With one exception, my friends thought I was strange and always gave me odd looks when I chose the female characters. Once, at a gaming convention, I was a little too excited, grabbing the girl character, and this guy who joined us gave me the most degrading look, like I was human filth to be wiped off his shoe.

When a dear friend came out as gay, I thought long and hard. We went to lunch and I told him I thought I was bisexual ‚Äì he laughed, saying, ‚Äúno, X, you‚Äôre straight.‚Äù This outcome confused me, since I was sure he‚Äôd confirm my suspicions. I always thought, and I‚Äôm not speaking for anyone else here, but I always imagined that if I were suddenly transformed into a girl (yay!), I‚Äôd be into guys.

I have wide hips and, when I‚Äôm in good shape, a narrow waist. The friend I just mentioned used to shake his head, when looking at my body, for being too feminine. He advised, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell people about your hips.‚Äù I never really understood that suggestion since it‚Äôs visible if you just look. More teasing when, of course, I become really ‚Äì really! ‚Äì into manpurses. My favorites are the very feminine, though slightly androgynous and made for men, Japanese brand Takeo Kikuchi.

My first girlfriend had a similar body size and shape to mine, except for her lovely breasts. So I could fit into her skirts and, once, one of her lingerie pieces. She wasn‚Äôt a fan and I never did that again.

Anyways, I guess I‚Äôm writing this because the strangest thing happened. I always wanted to be a writer. But this is another area of my life where my parents and friends weren‚Äôt happy with and steered me away from. However, I moved as far as possible away from them and I find myself alone, lots of time on my hands and, screw them, I took up writing.

I love scifi and fantasy, so thought that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd be writing, but the first book I wrote, well, it took over and it wrote itself: a transgender romance. I‚Äôm, ah, terrible at lying and keeping secrets and my mother got it out of me. So she‚Äôs read it ‚Äì and, to my surprise, likes it! Naturally, I didn‚Äôt want to tell my father ‚Äì this is a man who, when I first hugged him as an adult after coming home from a long time abroad, froze in terror. I literally had to teach him how to hug. When I was in middle school, my stepmother told me he didn‚Äôt sleep for a week when I started wearing pink. So I was terrified of him reading it.

Well, I called him for Father‚Äôs Day and he read the book. He liked it! I‚Äôm just blown away. I foolishly tell him, ‚Äúdad, it‚Äôs actually been well received and made the top of its category twice, for two days each.‚Äù Oops! Why on earth did I say that?

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the category?‚Äù he asks.

‚ÄúUh, transgender romance.‚Äù  Silence.

* I hug my parents with true sincerity
* I yelp if my breasts hit something
* The oily patch between my eyebrows is completely gone
* I cry when I think about or see animal abuse. I can cry period
* I stop in front of mirrors and smile instead of smacking myself in frustration
* I sleep
* I‚Äôm happy to wear clothes when I wake up
* I FINALLY enjoy taking pictures of myself
* I can communicate with others without feeling like I‚Äôm wearing a mask
* My butt used to be so flat. It is no longer flat in the slightest
* I haven‚Äôt learned yet, but the thought of wearing makeup makes me giddy instead of shameful
* Omg fck junk food and meat this bitch gotta take care of her skin ok???
* My hair is no longer a security blanket. I can cut it short and still feel feminine.
* I stopped gaming and watching TV. They were forms of self sedation for me because existing was painful. I can literally sit and do nothing and be happy (by nothing I mean play with my tits)
* I sympathize so hard with other trans folk trying to get by. So hard.
* Speaking of hard, goodbye annoying erections of all kinds, thank Belial
* When I shave my legs, I no longer look like I got into a kickboxing match with a blender
* I finally care about being alive

This is not even close to everything but I don‚Äôt want to write a book here. I‚Äôm just so grateful for getting the chance to transition that I needed to write about it.

I am really sorry if I offend anyone with this post - that is certainly not what I mean to do. I was hoping to get done insight from those who know.

My best friend has a child who was born a female. They are 14 years old. They have been going through some emotional problems lately like depression and struggling to get on with people at school. 

As a child they were really girly with dolls, girly clothes and being really into princesses etc. This was true up until very recently when they have announced that they are trans.

Is this the experience of many people? Were many people typical of the gender of the bodies they were born into when they were young?

My friend is fully supportive, and I think she's doing the right thing, but I want to understand because my understanding was that most people present the gender they actually are early on in life and not the gender of the body they were born.

I'm trying to get started on transitioning and I'm a bit at a loss. I have been looking for places to get started everywhere but it's been a bit hard. I don't really know who to talk to first. Do you think my college counselor would be a good option? 
I can't go to my family doctor as I've been estranged from my family and that doctor is rather far from where I live now. I've been looking for things online but they have been really confusing for me, usually they don't apply to my area or straight up don't apply to me at all. I'm really hoping I can get started and be more out since I'm starting my bachelor's degree this year and along with that I'd like to start getting closer to who I am on the inside aswell!
Any advice would be very appreciated!

I am about a year removed from my egg cracking. Since then  my life has dramatically changed in my relationship with my S/o and where I am living due to financial issues and such. 

I came out to one of my parents (divorced) and that is going fairly well, but I have not with the other... im afraid I am going to be disowned, but thats not by biggest issue inside my head .

My biggest issue is being closeted and dealing with this crippling dysphoria. I don't think I can look at a single woman without it popping up. Its always been an ebb and flow with dysphoria in my head but lately its been daily , hourly and almost by the minute. 

I dont have a great way to express my true self, but do what I can with clothes and whatnot when possible. I havent been to a therapist since before covid and probably will need to find a different therapist in general due to some personal issues associated with my previous therapist. Theres also no support groups around that aren't aimed at youth specifically and would feel out of place attending at my age. 

I start hrt in August, so I feel like i jave that to look forward to, but then is the stress of coming out to my other relatives.

I‚Äôm 23 years old and I guess you could say, that I‚Äôm having a identity crisis?

Hear me out, please.
Biologically, I was born female but if you look back at my childhood, I‚Äôve never been the girliest girl under the sun. At all.
I hated dresses and dolls and much rather played with legos, toy cars and mud.
I know that doesn‚Äôt say much but here comes the thing; when I was about 12 (I think) for the first time I‚Äôd cut my own hair short, wore ‚Äúboys clothes‚Äù for 2 whole years and just...lived life for 2 years, until my mother convinced me to stop (more like pressuring me into stopping but oh well).
I went on to be ‚Äúgirly‚Äù for the next 6 years or so, living as I was supposed to and tbh I didn‚Äôt mind it much because I had other things to worry about.
At age 20/21, I ... ‚Äúrelapsed‚Äù and chopped my hair off once more, wore guy clothes for m o n t h s before stopping again, going back into the role I was supposed to take because I had no support to back me up within my family and I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress.

So back to being a girl I went.
Now, two years later, I‚Äôm back at it again, I moved out from my parents house though and live where nobody knows me, but not too far away from them.
But I‚Äôm scared, to be honest.
Scared to come out, scared to ‚Äúexpose‚Äù myself and even more (probably the most) scared that I‚Äôm making a mistake.
Im 23 years old and I know most people transition or decide to transition by like a young(er) age...is it too late? Did I wait too long? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing but I know that basically, I feel a lot more comfortable presenting masculine and I‚Äôm so much more confident...
It‚Äôs a good feeling, because it feels like I‚Äôm in control.
As a female, I‚Äôm shy and awkward and don‚Äôt talk much except for to my close friends.

I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself anymore. I‚Äôve been binding for the past like 3 or 4 weeks and it makes me feel better but I‚Äôm still feeling like I‚Äôm missing something, I think.

Does anyone maybe know some advice that could help me?

2020-06-22 22:21:43,he26ya,3,1,"Hi there, i'm currently dating a person who is transmasculine. I've tried to socially transition before, but had been rejected by my friendships and community as a whole (why are you complicating your life, they had asked). However, a few months later after I gave up, I met my partner and they are part of a thriving queer community where it's ok to be trans!

I've slowly come out as non binary as a result.

However, my partner is very serious about transitioning to a man, and while I am supportive, lately, the idea of having sex with their masculine version makes me want to throw up. I don't want to become the woman in the relationship, i really don't want to do certain sexual positions that I know they're really into.

I've found myself resenting their intense focus on transitioning, and feel that I can't come out as trans myself, because they have a complex where they think they influence and inspire people to be like them. I feel like it's important for them to have me as their 'girlfriend' because it solidifies their masculinity-- i've asked them not to call me that, but they express dissatisfaction and still call me that.

My partner is a very important person, and their trans journey is incredibly momentous to them. I feel invisibilized tho.

I can't tell if i'm transphobic because I don't want to have sex with them as a man after surgery. I've tried broaching the idea of an open relationship, but to be honest, i'm very much a monogamous type and it feels more like a break up than polyamory. I've said that I feel uncomfortable with certain sexual positions, and being penetrated with a penis, and they've reassured me that our relationship can be without those things; however, they continue to bring it up casually ('i can't wait to be inside u with my own penis"" etc)

To put it bluntly though, I'm somewhat of a pretty boy, to the point of being mistaken for a lady since I was in middle school and through college (had long hair and dress somewhat androgynously). 

It's not like I grew up in a super conservative family, my parents were hippies, but at the same rate my grandparents were conservative although they were supportive of me despite how I looked and behaved despite telling me ""you look like a girl"" in an obviously disapproving way. I was born in the tail end of the 80's and grew up in the 90's when although things weren't completely backward, this kind of thing wasn't nearly as accepted as it is now. 

Now I hit 30 a half a year back and I'm realizing I've been repressing my feelings/natural tendency to considering myself as a woman/feminine. I've been flirting with these ideas for a long time but I haven't been able to act on them. I ran away around when  turned 17, put myself through college and have been grinding at work for the last decade or so. Now I've somewhat built up a career in what I think is a somewhat open workplace. I may find myself with some money as well in the next year or so (a relative passed away). So I think I'll have enough money to start taking steps towards transition (HRT).

I feel like I'm at an impasse living the way I have. I've been continuously putting off things like relationships/sex for years.

Most of all when I saw myself that way I felt nice, it finally felt like I could see myself the way I wanted to. 

With that said I have a lot of questions that leave me hesitant. I want on some level to still have that nuclear family, find a wife and have kids. I don't know how I could have that if I transition. Do lesbians typically find trans women attractive? Are there many women who would date me?  I also know that this will seem shallow (and hopefully not hurtful for any of the folks here), but will I pass as a woman, will people accept me? If I don't transition will I just feel like I'm living a lie?

I'm a journalist who covers LGBT issues and gaming for several UK newspapers and publications, interested in learning more about the LGBT and specifically trans community on Roblox.

I've seen young players of Roblox talk about how they feel good in the game because they can customize their avatar and affirm their gender identity, or they feel supported by the game's LGBT community. But I've also heard stories of trolling and transphobia.

If you're a trans Roblox player and would be happy to share your thoughts and experiences with me, please get in touch in this post or send me a DM. I'd particularly like to hear any ways you feel the game and its community have been positive or negative in your exploration of your gender identity, or any particular stories of your experiences.

They brushed it off and I was instead told I was a tomboy and that's what I believed for most of my life because lots of girls were tomboys. However when I started getting into romantic relationships I because really sad and depressed around my boyfriends. I never knew why this was, but now I know it was because I was kinda jealous of them. I wanted to be them. I don't know if this is because I just thought they were a good person, or gender dysphoria though. But now I can't look at a man without thinking 'god I wanna be him.' The idea of being a male makes me so happy. When I fantasize about my ideal future I see myself as a man.

But the thing is is that I'm comfortable being a girl. I only feel like i get real feelings of dysphoria when I see like a shirtless dude lol. What does that mean for me? I've taken multiple gender dysphoria tests online and they've come out as me having mild dysphoria. Am I trans if I'm comfortable being a girl? I don't want to put stress on my family and friends if I do decide to transition if I didn't need to transition in the first place.

I came out as a trans woman about two months ago, and so far my reception from most friends and family has been awesome. People are more supporting than I could have ever imagined, and my boyfriend (who is a trans man) has been so helpful along my still short journey.

You might ask yourself then, dear friend, what‚Äôs the issue? And trust me, I have been asking myself that numerous times. I don‚Äôt have a doubt in my heart that I am a woman, and that my coming out as trans has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. But somehow I still feel something wrong. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but I somehow feel really alone in my struggles. My boyfriend is quite a bit farther in his transition than I am (I just began therapy leading up to me getting cleared for hormones), and he tries his best to aid my in my journey, but I‚Äôm not sure he completely follow my thoughts every time. 

I don‚Äôt know if anyone has, or has had similar issues, but if you have/have had, then I would be very grateful to get some inputs into what I could do to figure this whole process out.

2020-06-23 20:47:35,hemowq,4,2,"Hello everyone, I am visiting this sub hoping that you can answer this question. I hope this is the right subreddit to ask this. If it's not, please let me know and I'll delete or repost on an appropriate subreddit, if there is one. English I also not my first language, so if something sounds rude or badly worded, I want to apologize in advance.

Basically, a couple of days ago someone on twitter made a fanedit of their favorite celebrities (all male) as girls and got completely destroyed in the comments for being transphobic for posting this edit. The edit wasn't done very well, just their faces photoshopped onto female bodies with long hair, titled as ""genderbend"", if I remember correctly.

I understand how the term ""genderbend"" can be problematic, since it says ""gender"" and not ""sex"", considering the female bodies that were used for the edit.

However the main reason OP got trashed so much was because they mostly turned the celebrities into ""girls"" by making them have long hair. So now the comments were saying that it is transphobic to assume all girls have long hair. I'm guessing they were referring to trans women who haven't come out yet/still pass as men? But it's not like cis girls all have long hair by default either, so I couldn't understand why everyone was so mad about it for this reason.

There also seems to have been a problem with this being an edit of the real people, and not a self drawn fanart which could have been explained as an ""original character"", but I'm not very into the fanart community so I don't know how that exactly works.

Unfortunately I couldn't find the link to the tweet anymore, OP probably deleted it by now.

So in conclusion my question is: Is it transphobic/insensitive to make this kind of edits? Since it's technically fanart and as far as I understand it, fanartists usually make their own universes(?) where they change the gender/sexuality/appearances and sometimes even race (making them werewolf or animal hybrid).

2020-06-25 02:07:26,hfe1v7,1,1,"I‚Äôve been dating a MTF woman for a few months now. Due to her knowings of being trans and all, she can typically tell when someone is an egg when they explain how they feel. Recently, I‚Äôve opened up and explained things about myself and all, and she confirmed that I‚Äôm possibly transgender.

Now, I think I have internalized transphobia of myself? I accept trans people and don‚Äôt see them any different, but I can‚Äôt see myself as trans. My girlfriend said this is trans doubt.

It makes sense. Thinking ‚Äúwhy am I doing this.‚Äù But I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not trans enough.

I have huge chests. H u g e. They‚Äôre 40 Gs, and I hate them. I don‚Äôt get pain or they don‚Äôt cause any problems. I just... don‚Äôt like them and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm attractive with it. I‚Äôve always had ideas of getting my chest removed since the age of 13. I started wearing a binder. I came out as agender for a while, but at age 15, we moved to a very small town, with very conservative people. My parents got me to dress feminine, and I grew with it. They knew that I wanted to be known as Milan, with they/them pronouns. But, as them being really toxic already, they didn‚Äôt care and saw me as female. As the next three years go on, I dress casual, comfortable. Skinny jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, sweaters. All of them super baggy. I thought it was just a style I liked. But now thinking about it, it may just be because I subconsciously still wanted to be recognized as they/them. And, I still didn‚Äôt want my chest. I still want top surgery to this day. 

So 2020 rolls around, and I meet this beautiful girl. We start dating. Now, that I‚Äôm in the city more often, going with my girlfriend to electrology and her doing transitioning and such, I‚Äôve always been super supportive. Making sure she was comfortable and happy. She did the same. She always said that no matter how I looked, she liked me for ME. My heart, my brain. Not my looks. She didn‚Äôt care for the looks. So, with me being away from a conservative tiny town and away from conservative family, I‚Äôve started doing things I‚Äôve been wanting to do. First, was wearing boxers. I love it. They made me feel comfortable and more attractive. Then, I dyed my hair black rather than the old washed out pink. Then I shaved the sides of it. I loved how it gave me a more masculine look. And then, I got really tired of my hair. I hated it. So I shaved it all off.


Sorry, I‚Äôm getting off track here.

Basically, the stories and experience I‚Äôve told to my girlfriend, she said it was definitely things trans people have felt.

She made it clear that she wasn‚Äôt trying to push me or anything, but she said one of the things trans people regret the most, is not starting on HRT sooner. 


I went to a doctor this past Monday, and he gave me testosterone. I immediately injected it that same day.

Something felt so right about it. I‚Äôm feeling so excited about possibly getting a beard, having a deeper voice, looking much more masculine... and passing.

God, passing. Being called he.. 

But, I‚Äôve been thinking the last two-three days..

‚ÄúShould I do this?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it too soon?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not trans enough?‚Äù 

I wore makeup growing up, so how would I suddenly change from feminine to masculine? Am I even trans?

After a bit of time, you notice that when you see yourself, even not in reflections, it's someone else's body. It's not you. This is getting really weird, you're looking at yourself and you know for a fact that is someone else's body not yours. Soon, people start calling you by another name, and referring to you like you're another person entirely. You try to tell people that it's not you, but everyone is acting like this is who you've always been, and this 'you' that you're describing had never existed.

You start doubting yourself, maybe they're right, maybe you're going crazy, maybe you've always been who you look like and who people say you are. But the more you try and accept the new you, the worse you feel, because why wouldn't you? You're acting like someone else, and everyone around you is acting like it's normal when it's clearly not.

Some people are hesitantly supportive, others act like you've gone mad, some say you're supposed to be the person you transformed into randomly, and that you'll never be someone else. 

Now every time you look at yourself you feel disgusted and maybe even angry, because you're still not who you know you are, and every time you see yourself you're reminded of that fact. Every time someone calls you by that different name, it stings become it's like they just don't see you anymore. So you finally work to change yourself, any way you can, back to your real self.

I‚Äôm an admin at a progressive leaning public charter middle school in New England. Our female staff tend to dress comfortably, dresses with or without cardigans, leggings under longer tunics, pencil skirts under jackets are less common unless it‚Äôs parent teacher night, sleeveless blouses should be topped with another layer unless it‚Äôs really hot out, nothing terribly revealing.

Since starting transitioning I‚Äôve been acquiring clothes that make me feel good, and exploring my style. So far it seems to be somewhere between cool soccer mom and witchy hippy. I‚Äôve attached pics so you can see.

I would love if people could post pics or links to items that you think would be essentials or fun appropriate pieces for me to get over the summer.

Flood me with recommendations!

I joined this community today, as I just found out my sister celebrated her last birthday today. From now on he will be celebrating every birthday from now on as a man. He came out to me just now and i am the first family member he has told. Ive always considered myself an ally since my (sister) now brother has always been a lesbian. But I only know the surface of transitioning. 


My family is very accepting, even though I know it will be hard for everyone to use the correct pronouns after 26 years. But I know he has a long road ahead of him. He lives a whole state away so I asked if hes comfortable having us on FaceTime or phone calls when he goes to doctors and everything included in transitioning to help us accept this and to be a part of the process so itll be easier for us to make the changes he wants from us. He was so happy about that and was excited.


Also he came out to me last year when he was super drunk and then completely avoided the subject once sober so I decided to leave it, he was drunk today as well. How should I go about it if he's still repressing it once he's sober again? 

If anyone else has any advice on how your family/friends got used to the change and what hardships should we be prepared for to help support him and i would love books and websites to give us some more knowledge on this. I would really appreciate it. 

Also if I said anything offensive or wrong in this post please correct me, I am learning and open to it all.

i've got dysphoria i guess. i'm very self conscious about my bone structure, my delicate hands and feet, *those* parts, my thighs and fat distribution, even my callygraphy. i know my name and my pronouns and i get uncomfortable when i feel like i don't pass, or at least i used to get, now getting misgendered is meh.

i am in the process of changing my name and sex on my id. this feels just right, i know what i want to be treated as socially.

however, i just started hrt about two and a half months ago after fighting a lot to be able to, after dreaming a lot about it, after hating my body so much, and now i'm having second thoughts. what if i am not really trans? what if i end up realizing this aint about right and i should stop now before it's too late and detransitioning will be more painful? maybe i'm just insecure about not being as dysphoric these days (though i DEFINITELY want top surgery) and i'm not used to it, but my body is starting to change. my voice is lower, i've got some more body hair, i feel kinda stronger, dat bottom growth is present. none of the changes have bothered me at all, but what if they will in the future, when things are more irreversible?

i always liked singing and now i can't sing like i used to cause i can't reach high notes, and i don't know how to feel about it. i've been watching movies and i kinda like how girls live, maybe it's something i'd want. maybe i just want to be cis and i can't, though, or maybe i'm just a feminine boy and i like girl's cute clothes.

i've been quite down lately, perhaps that's messing with my mind. i'm so confused and uncertain. i'm happy with how my body is aside from my chest and bottom parts, though i still have minor dysphoria about my tiny hands and feet.

i'm still under 18. if i decide to stop for a while, my mama may just feel like her big efforts are being thrown away and i'm just a confused girl, she'll stop fighting with me for the id correction and she won't trust me again and won't let me start again if i decide to. so ive got this pressure of not going back with my decision? idk how to express more clearly

i'm also having trouble with eating and am unsatisfied with my weight but that's something else (though i have that little insecurity if i am just a girl with an eating disorder that thinks she's a boy) , i even have a nutrition plan etc

I came out as a trans girl a year ago, but just to my gf and a few people who I trust; at first she said it was okay, that she would try to get used to dating a girl. (At least she identifies my as a girl, yaaay  uwu )

Now, here is the thing, in a date we had a few days ago, she told me she wasn't too comfortable with the idea of dating a woman, why? Because her whole life she's been hearing stuff like ""ugh, you look not femenine"" or ""you look lesbian, lol""; and also said: ""Even if I love you so much, I dont see myself dating a girl. I'm totally straight, I can't do it"".

At first, it was pretty shocking, because she already told me that she would try to get used to this... but then I realized that I can't make her feel comfortable about this, she has her own reasons and her own desires, she loves me, but she's not a lesbian.

I told her that I still wasn't going to do anything about my body, and I'll have to wait a few months or even years to start with hormones, so... I said I would like to stay with her as long as I can, and when I start my transition, I just hope she can still be my best friend.

For context, I was assigned male and still identify as a man, though I often have serious doubts about that (that's a discussion for another day, and I do plan on meeting a gender therapist at some point in the near future).

&amp;#x200B;

Very often I wonder if my life would have gone any different had I been born a female. And so, I finally did a thought experiment on that. 

What if I was born female?

I looked at all the key moments in my life that made me who I am now. How all my interests have developed over the years, who my biggest influences were, and how all of this has impacted my ambitions, desires, etc. How would these have changed if I was born female?

As it turns out, the difference is significant.

I believe that young boys and girls have a tendency to choose their friends in different ways. I would likely not have made the same friends as I did in real life, and so a good amount of the people who influenced me in my youth would have changed. Factor in the change to the key moments in my life, and this would have a significant impact on who I would become as an adult.

I would have been a very different person, had I been born female. Happier? Possibly. But very different.

flash forward to about a year ago. i was struggling with feelings that i was actually ftm, not nonbinary, and had gotten the courage to tell her. so when we were alone, i told her i felt more like a boy than nonbinary, and her reaction was not the support i was expecting. she told me that i didn't seem like a boy, and that i never acted like a boy when i was younger, and that i was definitely nonbinary, and that i was confused.

2020-06-27 17:00:15,hgx3tr,14,5,"So I have followed the online discourse around trans issues \*loosely\* over the past several years. It's too upsetting for me to follow closely. There are people who have the guts to follow it closely and I wish I had those guts.

A little about me to set up my point: I am a trans woman. It's been almost 2 decades since I transitioned.

Early on I was not really ""passable"" (if there is a better word or term for this now please let me know). This was due to the usual factors that a lot of us deal with. I still had a wig then; I have natural long hair now. I dressed up too much in casual situations; I don't now. And of course generally just becoming comfortable with being a woman in public after a lifetime of presenting as a boy in public (this part definitely the most important element and can only be achieved with time).

After about a year and a half I became pretty well passable in most situations. Only the discerning viewer ""clocks me"" at this point, but it does still happen from time to time.

Anyway, during the time I wasn't passable for the most part, I got my share of public hate. This was in the early 2000s. There is no reason to list all of the stories but needless to say, there were several instances of public ""drama."" OK twist my arm three quick ones: A guy threatened to call the police on me for being in the bathroom with his daughter. A guy literally chased me around a retail store screaming ""you're too tall!"" A guy in the middle of an outdoor dining situation started screaming at me across the parking lot. He was in the restaurant, I was in the parking lot. In front of his table and all the rest of the diners, he started screaming insults at me. I wanted to go back and fight him but one of my girlfriends talked me out of it.

So back to the point at hand: I have been watching the discourse around trans issues and I have noticed that a big focal point for some of the recent hate is trans people who are not ""conventionally passable."" I'm trying to say this the most delicate way possible, but basically trans people who would be easily picked out a lineup as being trans. These are often trans people who--like me in the story above--have just recently started living as a woman publicly. They have an obvious wig or they haven't done electrolysis yet or something else like that (or multiple things like that). Bottom line: they are people who easily read as trans just by posting a photo of them on Twitter.

Anyway, this has been on my mind a lot because I keep seeing it pop up like a pattern. All of the usual anti-trans accounts on Twitter (male and female accounts) have been trafficking in this. It goes like this: 1. post a photo of a trans-identifying person who does not look passable. 2. Then say pretty much anything or nothing at all, and 3. let the followers do most of the heavy lifting.

The followers will then proceed to say all of the nasty things about the person that the OP did not say (often for risk of being suspended) and everyone will have a bug dunking party on this poor soul. Or, the OP will post a photo of a non-passable trans woman and say something like ""do you want this in the bathroom with your daughter"" or ""this person just won a race against women I hope they are proud"" or something similar.

The salient point is this: their whole argument rests on the relative ""un-passible-ness"" of the trans person. If the trans person looked like a flawless cis woman, they would have no argument.

Do you see what I am getting at here? If the trans person was 5'2"" and looked exactly like Reese Witherspoon (random example) would any of their postings have any sort of impact? Who would mind Reese Witherspoon being in the bathroom with their daughter, even if told they were a trans person? Not many, or at least not as many as we have now.

Here is my take on this, and this is based on the experience of living roughly half my life (and pretty much all of my adult life) as a woman: this is based in misogyny as much as it is based in anti-trans ideology.

What do I mean by that? So, of course there are tons of people in the world who don't like trans people and don't think being trans is a valid existence. Some even hate trans people. I get that; I promise you I get that. But what I also get is that society has a problem with ""unattractive women"" writ large, and I think our community is getting pulled into that trap as well.

Here is what I have learned and observed in the past 20 years:

1. (most) men expect (or strongly prefer) women to be attractive.
2. (many) women expect other women to be attractive.

Similar expectations are not placed on men. Women are under enormous pressure to be pleasing to the eye (usually the male eye). Many men (and even many women) will look at a very heavy and/or conventionally unattractive \*cis\* woman as an affront to their eyes.

I feel like maybe one of you is saying right now ""no OP, it's just that they hate trans people."" Please understand that I get that. I really do. I get that many people are never going to like or accept trans people. What I have been fascinated by, however, is how misogyny is woven throughout anti-trans ideology. I also think that misogyny is woven heavily into anti-gay ideology. I don't even think this is often conscious in the subject. I think there are lots of people who hate trans people and hate gays and they don't even realize that it is unconsciously based in misogyny. In fact I think TERFs, ironically, often traffic in misogyny. I don't think they always realize it either. What I mean is, I don't think they realize that the source of their anti-trans disposition is actually latent/unconscious misogyny.

I hope I haven't lost too many of you by this point. I am still very much thinking my way through all of this. Bottom line takeaway is that I think lots of anti-trans thought is based in misogyny and a subset of that manifests itself around the discussion of how attractive of a woman a certain trans person seems to a cis person. Does that make sense? We fail at being women in many people's eyes because we (some of us anyway) fail at being conventionally attractive women. Please feel free to share your thoughts on this. Thanks for listening!

p.s. to be very, very clear: not for a moment am I suggesting that any person--trans or cis--needs to do anything differently in order to please these people. I am merely trying to have a philosophical discussion here. In no way on any level do I think that cis women or trans women should worry--or should have to worry--about looking a certain way to please others. My point in bringing up my own journey was merely to point out that public hate stopped being directed at me once I fell into the category of ""not being overtly offensive to the male gaze."" I was not trying to suggest that being passable is the goal--or should be the goal--of transitioning.",trans,"I've been thinking about the recent Twitter suspensions (of anti-trans accounts) and all that and have some thoughts...(this is long, kinda deep and possibly emotional so be forewarned lol)",1593302415.0,"{'created_utc': 1593277215, 'id': 'hgx3tr', 'num_comments': 14, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'So I have followed the online discourse around trans issues \\*loosely\\* over the past several years.

So, of course there are tons of people in the world who don\'t like trans people and don\'t think being trans is a valid existence. Some even hate trans people. I get that; I promise you I get that. But what I also get is that society has a problem with ""unattractive women"" writ large, and I think our community is getting pulled into that trap as well.\n\nHere is what I have learned and observed in the past 20 years:\n\n1. (most) men expect (or strongly prefer) women to be attractive.\n2. (many) women expect other women to be attractive.\n\nSimilar expectations are not placed on men. Women are under enormous pressure to be pleasing to the eye (usually the male eye). Many men (and even many women) will look at a very heavy and/or conventionally unattractive \\*cis\\* woman as an affront to their eyes.\n\nI feel like maybe one of you is saying right now ""no OP, it\'s just that they hate trans people."" Please understand that I get that. I really do. I get that many people are never going to like or accept trans people. What I have been fascinated by, however, is how misogyny is woven throughout anti-trans ideology. I also think that misogyny is woven heavily into anti-gay ideology. I don\'t even think this is often conscious in the subject. I think there are lots of people who hate trans people and hate gays and they don\'t even realize that it is unconsciously based in misogyny. In fact I think TERFs, ironically, often traffic in misogyny. I don\'t think they always realize it either. What I mean is, I don\'t think they realize that the source of their anti-trans disposition is actually latent/unconscious misogyny.\n\nI hope I haven\'t lost too many of you by this point. I am still very much thinking my way through all of this. Bottom line takeaway is that I think lots of anti-trans thought is based in misogyny and a subset of that manifests itself around the discussion of how attractive of a woman a certain trans person seems to a cis person. Does that make sense? We fail at being women in many people\'s eyes because we (some of us anyway) fail at being conventionally attractive women. Please feel free to share your thoughts on this. Thanks for listening!\n\np.s. to be very, very clear: not for a moment am I suggesting that any person--trans or cis--needs to do anything differently in order to please these people. I am merely trying to have a philosophical discussion here. In no way on any level do I think that cis women or trans women should worry--or should have to worry--about looking a certain way to please others. My point in bringing up my own journey was merely to point out that public hate stopped being directed at me once I fell into the category of ""not being overtly offensive to the male gaze."" I was not trying to suggest that being passable is the goal--or should be the goal--of transitioning.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I've been thinking about the recent Twitter suspensions (of anti-trans accounts) and all that and have some thoughts...(this is long, kinda deep and possibly emotional so be forewarned lol)"", 'created': 1593302415.0}"

My name is Nina, I am an Honors candidate in Psychology at Charles Sturt University in Australia, and I would like to invite you to participate in my dissertation survey about self-kindness and mental health. This online study is open to trans, non-binary, and gender diverse adults, aged 18 and over, and will take no longer than 20 minutes (probably a lot less). Participation is entirely anonymous as no identifying data is recorded. Survey data will be used in my Honors dissertation, with the intent of results being publicly available if published in academic journals (I will also post a summary of results to this forum if people are interested). The long-term aim of this study is to develop approaches to mental health beyond the cisgender standard.

This study has formal approval from the Charles Sturt University Human Research Ethics Committee.

Please click the link below for further information and to complete the survey.

Content warning: the survey does include some questions about depression, suicidal thoughts, and dysphoria. These are all outlined in the information statement preceding the questionnaire, but please take care if you believe these types of questions would be upsetting/triggering for you.

Thanks!

I apologise for my ignorance beforehand because I am uneducated about the subject. For as much as I currently understand, I am not transphobic and do not wish the trans community any harm. I think of myself as an ally in the sense that I support the trans community's fight to express themselves as they wish, because everyone should have the freedom to do so.

These are the questions I have, and hope that you may discuss them with me. Thank you for your cooperation in advance:

1. Gender is performative and learnt. Some traits are stereotypically deemed 'masculine', others 'feminine'. Why is there a need for transgender people to be trans? Is it not OK to display stereotypically 'masculine' traits despite being biologically female (&amp; vice versa)? Traits are mostly not inherently gendered anyway at the end of the day. By rejecting their biological gender (I note the difference between sex and gender), are trans people really just rejecting the gender stereotypes enforced onto them in favour of the opposite/other gender(s)? Those that are gendered are like so because they are influenced by hormones; these are traits that are not learnt and happen unconsciously as part of body functions. 

2. Given the difference between gender and sex, one being psychological and the other being biological, this would make people who have had reconstructive surgery transsexual. However, being transgender and transsexual are not synonymous, although many times, those who are transsexual are transgender as well. 

a. Firstly, is there an issue with the term 'transsexual' as I don't see it being used very often. (Note: I will continue using it for the sake of differentiating it from the term 'transgender' but I apologise again if it is, in fact, a slur or an offensive term) 

b. Secondly, I have noticed that many transsexuals talk about how they were 'born in the wrong body'. While I don't know and will never know what that means, I would like to try and understand. Does it mean that, e.g. a trans female wanted e.g. boobs, a vagina, or long hair etc rather than a penis? Is it as simple as that? I bring this up because this is what the surgery gives people. 

c. Many say that biological body parts do not define a gender/sex. For instance, having a vagina does not mean that you're female. If so, then what is the point in undergoing reconstructive surgery? 

Please feel free to correct whatever statements, assumptions, misjudgments I have made, answer my questions, as well as share anything you think may be relevant to help me understand you/the trans community better. Again, I apologise for whatever may be offensive and misguided, and emphasise that I come from a place of lack of knowledge/understanding / ignorance, rather than hate and transphobia.

2020-06-28 10:51:46,hhcfz4,3,1,"So I've been questioning my gender for the past few months, and I really can't tell anymore, so why not ask Reddit? 

I'm AFAB, however I wear masculine clothing, which at first I thought could just mean I was a tomboy. However now I get chest dysphoria, so I've started trying to bind, but being big chested means no amount of binding really gets it to go away, which makes me feel uncomfortable, but not horrible. I don't seem to get dysphoric from waist down though - then again, I'm also Asexual, which I wonder if that changes anything because I just don't feel the need to have it?

Ever since I was a child, I can vaguely remember always being the masculine person in my group of friends - I played the dad, or the brother in roleplaying games, I played videogames, I tried deepening my voice all the time, and I wanted to look cool - to impress the boys so they'd like me, but in a non-romantic way.

I also don't mind my name - people have told me they don't think it suits me, but I don't get called by my name often - it's mostly nicknames about my height, since I'm really short, rather than my real name, or a shorter version of my name, which to me kinda sounds gender-neutral, so again, can't tell with that. \n\nEver since I was a child, I can vaguely remember always being the masculine person in my group of friends - I played the dad, or the brother in roleplaying games, I played videogames, I tried deepening my voice all the time, and I wanted to look cool - to impress the boys so they'd like me, but in a non-romantic way. \n\nI was wondering if there was anything I could do to help me identify what I am? I hate most things feminine, so I really don't think trying that might make me comfortable. I was wondering how to try out names or pronouns? Any advice would be super helpful, really."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am I trans?', 'created': 1593366706.0}"

They also work in education in a pretty conservative area, so anything they do needs to be pretty easy to cover, as they can't come out at this point in their career. One of the biggest things is shaving their face/softening the hair there? If that makes sense? So they don't constantly look like they have 5 o'clock shadow.

2020-06-29 05:28:53,hhu24w,0,1,"Hi, this is Janie.  I know text doesn't convey emotion very well, so I want to just let you know that I am not upset or offended.  I just know that I can explain this better than [redacted] right now, and I want to try.  He's a sweetheart, but he doesn't really understand everything about being trans, and he doesn't have to.  He's respectful and friendly and caring, and that's more than I can say for a lot of people.

So, here goes.  Transgenderism is a condition; not a sexual orientation or even a gender in and of itself.  All it means is that a person's biological sex, what was determined at birth by the doctor who measured their dingus, doesn't match their gender.  I'm going to get into some stuff here that may be hard to accept, but I just want you to know that this is what medical specialists in the field of psychology generally agree about.  And all the major health organizations agree on this and support us.

That being said, hooo boy.  Gender is performance.  It is a social construct with different implications specific to each culture, at each point in time and history.  Gender is what you feel you are or want to be.  If it's male, you're male.  If it's female, you're female.  If neither of those suit you, pick some pronouns to have people use for you; typically they/them because English doesn't have a singular gender neutral set (they/them is becoming accepted for singular use though).

As for the cis guy not wanting to date a trans woman, even though he's okay with her being trans and living her life and such: trans women are women.  I'm sure he means well, but the fact that he is skeezed out by the thought of dating ANY trans woman is in and of itself, transphobic.  Some transphobia manifests as anger, some manifests as disgust, some manifests as exclusion.

If its about genitals, ask him if he would date a trans man, assuming he still has a fully-functioning vagina.  A lot of trans guys don't get surgery for down there because they either don't mind it as-is or their options aren't good enough.  Its easier to make a hole than a pole when you're working with human anatomy.

And the last thing I need to clear up is that a trans person's transition is complete when they feel comfortable with their body.  If they don't want ""the surgery"" (because there isn't just one type), they cannot and should not be forced into it.  It is insanely expensive, and most insurance plans don't cover bottom surgery, let alone other things related to transition like speech therapy, hormone replacements, facial feminization surgery, hair transplants, top surgery, etc.  These are things many trans people have to barely scrape by in order to afford because their body dysphoria and societal scrutiny can easily make them feel like things will never get better.  Just look up transgender suicide statistics; its staggering.  And that doesn't even account for the murders of trans people.  This shit is real.  If it wasn't, there is no way we would expose ourselves to all this risk.  

Bottom line, people like J. K. Rowling who think we're all loosey goosey carefree weirdos wanting to stroll into whatever restroom sounds fun, have no idea what it's like for us.  Most of us just want to fit in with everyone else and be treated equally and with respect.  There's not any higher chance of any of us being rapists and murderers; that's fear mongering.  People will always find things to confirm their bias, but you should really dig into what they're saying.  Ask for sources, check sources, see if the sources have any amount of legitimacy to them.  Most people won't do this because it takes effort, and they‚Äôre eager to hear something that validates their discomfort.  It's easy to con the willing when you‚Äôre exhausting them with supposed ‚Äúfacts‚Äù.

Anyhoo.  That's my rant.  I feel very strongly about this stuff because obviously it's very important to me.  Just to reiterate though, I'm not upset at you.

Please let me know if I misspoke in any way.,1593433733.0,"{'created_utc': 1593408533, 'id': 'hhu24w', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi, this is Janie.  I know text doesn\'t convey emotion very well, so I want to just let you know that I am not upset or offended.  I just know that I can explain this better than [redacted] right now, and I want to try.  He\'s a sweetheart, but he doesn\'t really understand everything about being trans, and he doesn\'t have to.  He\'s respectful and friendly and caring, and that\'s more than I can say for a lot of people.\n\nSo, here goes.  Transgenderism is a condition; not a sexual orientation or even a gender in and of itself.  All it means is that a person\'s biological sex, what was determined at birth by the doctor who measured their dingus, doesn\'t match their gender.  I\'m going to get into some stuff here that may be hard to accept, but I just want you to know that this is what medical specialists in the field of psychology generally agree about.  And all the major health organizations agree on this and support us.\n\nThat being said, hooo boy.  Gender is performance.  It is a social construct with different implications specific to each culture, at each point in time and history.  Gender is what you feel you are or want to be.  If it\'s male, you\'re male.  If it\'s female, you\'re female.  If neither of those suit you, pick some pronouns to have people use for you; typically they/them because English doesn\'t have a singular gender neutral set (they/them is becoming accepted for singular use though).\n\nAs for the cis guy not wanting to date a trans woman, even though he\'s okay with her being trans and living her life and such: trans women are women.  I\'m sure he means well, but the fact that he is skeezed out by the thought of dating ANY trans woman is in and of itself, transphobic.  Some transphobia manifests as anger, some manifests as disgust, some manifests as exclusion.\n\nIf its about genitals, ask him if he would date a trans man, assuming he still has a fully-functioning vagina.  A lot of trans guys don\'t get surgery for down there because they either don\'t mind it as-is or their options aren\'t good enough.  Its easier to make a hole than a pole when you\'re working with human anatomy.\n\nAnd the last thing I need to clear up is that a trans person\'s transition is complete when they feel comfortable with their body.  If they don\'t want ""the surgery"" (because there isn\'t just one type), they cannot and should not be forced into it.  It is insanely expensive, and most insurance plans don\'t cover bottom surgery, let alone other things related to transition like speech therapy, hormone replacements, facial feminization surgery, hair transplants, top surgery, etc.  These are things many trans people have to barely scrape by in order to afford because their body dysphoria and societal scrutiny can easily make them feel like things will never get better.  Just look up transgender suicide statistics; its staggering.  And that doesn\'t even account for the murders of trans people.  This shit is real.  If it wasn\'t, there is no way we would expose ourselves to all this risk.  \n\nBottom line, people like J. K. Rowling who think we\'re all loosey goosey carefree weirdos wanting to stroll into whatever restroom sounds fun, have no idea what it\'s like for us.  Most of us just want to fit in with everyone else and be treated equally and with respect.  There\'s not any higher chance of any of us being rapists and murderers; that\'s fear mongering.  People will always find things to confirm their bias, but you should really dig into what they\'re saying.  Ask for sources, check sources, see if the sources have any amount of legitimacy to them.  Most people won\'t do this because it takes effort, and they‚Äôre eager to hear something that validates their discomfort.  It\'s easy to con the willing when you‚Äôre exhausting them with supposed ‚Äúfacts‚Äù.\n\nAnyhoo.  That\'s my rant.  I feel very strongly about this stuff because obviously it\'s very important to me.  Just to reiterate though, I\'m not upset at you.  I\'m upset at people who disbelieve and disregard anything they don\'t have personal experience with or anything that contradicts what they were taught as children.

So I've been having flashes since i was a kid of wanting to be a girl, in private i would act and dress like a girl, parents thought it was a phase, im much smarter than them so I quickly learned how to hide and mask myself. But i also like being a boy now...... For one reason or another i never actually went through with being who i wanted and now im ready to transition into being more girly or femme i guess. The problem is that I've kinda grown to like being a guy as well. And there is no ""both"" gender....... 

Im in my mid twenties and i don't think its ""too late"" to start but pretty close as testosterone has made me very visibly male even though my body type is the guy with kinda wider hips so i have that going for me and im slightly overweight so i have a little moob going on hahaha. 

All in all I've understood many things about the world and myself since i was a kid and thus have been conducting psychological experiments on myself to try and figure out the world better and faster than others. Ill just say it worked but in doing so i put off this important part of my life and now i don't know what to do to get to being a girl or if I even still want that entirely. Also because id like to have kids with my own genes if possible one day and I heard estrogen and tblockers make you infertile.

I guess the optimal choice for me would be becoming feminine enough to sometimes dress girly, get some makeup and sort of ""get it out of my system"" and just continue my life as a male for the most part, im a very emotionally detached person with pretty much no family so there is no one I have to consult about this even and even if i make no real friends or relationships that way since it's basically only to quench a thirst so to speak, that's totally fine. Or maybe start a YouTube/streaming where im a girl and kinda use that to feel better about myself. Or maybe I could just find a way to be more feminine shaped, behave like it and still present as a male albeit girly (i have long emo scene type hair, scene chicks love it and so do guys). But then my chances of having kids naturally become slim since most women don't like feminine men. Something in between or alternating is best.

It feels like an impulsivity to dress girly and since im bi i end up arousing myself in private at times when i have these feelings and act on it. After a day or two it goes away and i once more feel good as a man. Some days pass and i find myself yearning to get called cute and just simply BE cute and attractive to guys as a girl would...

I'm accepting (I've always felt something wasn't right for her, like something was really off, and she didn't have the 'light' inside everyone else does......until now!!!!) I'm super excited and trying to reign it in so as not to overwhelm her as she's coming into new realizations. Our mom is accepting, a bit confused I think, but overall very supportive.
We're trying to plan how to best approach our dad about this, as he's a bit more conservative and I do worry about his initial reaction, and his depth of understanding on the topic. If there's maybe some places I can direct him for information on it, or that I could pull to being with us (I say us because my sister knows I will be beside her every step of this, and coming out....I cannot imagine the internal battles that rage. I couldn't think of sending her in to face all that alone). 

Also, and this is just for myself-- she's definitely not out to everyone, it's a very select group who know right now. But I'm having an internal struggle when I speak of her to family (she hasn't shared her name with them yet or they don't know) because I have to deadname her when I speak of her, and it kinda kills me inside a little.
I'm contemplating asking her what she would prefer, but I really don't want her to feel pressured to come out or divulge something to someone before she is ready. That's one of my biggest fears with this is outing her. 
Anyone have any similar experiences, and/or tips or advice they can share?


She's come alive in the last months in ways I have never ever seen before. It's absolutely so glorious, it's like a flower opening. And she's beautiful. I know this path isn't going to be a smooth one (nothing good comes easy, am I right?) But as much as I can, I wanna be there to help navigate and smooth what we can, and support and make space for what's unavoidable, and help lead her into living her best life.

Already we've discussed things like shopping and clothes- because of her height and such I'm thinking to teach her to sew (she's excited about that) and make and alter her own clothes so she has some freedom that way. And oh my gosh (gonna gush for a min sorry) she had her first hair cut recently and it looks sooooo good!!! She has beautiful long hair, but with the associated depression and whatnot it was easy to become unmanageable, and the (hairstylist?) returned it to it's healthy, shiny flowy self! I think she enjoyed it more than she realizes, aaaahhhhh it looks so good. I'm so fucking happy for her, to be realizing her truth and taking the steps to correcting things so she can live her best life!!!

Anyways, any resources are MUCH appreciated, TIA! knowledge is power, and I think it will be one of the best tools to keep in her toolkit.

2020-06-29 18:13:20,hi57vc,3,1,"My transwoman sister is on her journey, hormones and everything. 

Today we had a discussion, to which ended with her super upset with me... and I‚Äôm so sad for that, but would like clarification and understanding. 

She said that once she gets bottom
Surgery, she will be cis in her mind so won‚Äôt ever tell anyone otherwise. That even with romantic and intimate partners she will not divulge she is trans as long as she can pass as female.

She said the only reason she has to divulge now with partners is because she doesn‚Äôt pass. 

When I asked gently about the potential moral and ethical impacts of her proceeding in such a manner... she became super defensive - claiming I don‚Äôt understand nor see her as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù girl... and that she doesn‚Äôt need to carry the label forever as trans if she can pass as cis. 

I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to say without potentially making things worse... and I hear her heart and her gender dysphasia and pain and not being born in the body she should be.... and I grieve with her and want to support her... but I don‚Äôt think dishonesty is ideal or right either for her future partners. 
Why would someone want to even be with someone romantically or sexually if you can‚Äôt share and have them celebrate your journey with you? 

Anyways. I would love advise! 

If I‚Äôm wrong, please tell me! I want to support, but also I can‚Äôt handle lying or deceiving - which I feel is what her goal is to do... although I understand in her POV it is because she wants to be cis so badly. 

I want to also say I want her to pass! I want her to thrive! I just don‚Äôt support lying to partners... but if I‚Äôm wrong I can grow and change and be educated! I‚Äôm open to learning and growing.

2020-06-30 03:56:07,hifruz,0,1,"I just saw a video post of someone's mum reacting to them presenting female and it was beautiful.

I realised I don't remember how my mum or sister reacted the first time, but there's a wholesome reason for it.

I'd worn dresses before in private so it wasn't new for me, and they had been encouraging me to wear dresses for a while. Then my mum got a bunch of dresses from her friend for me to try, so one day I had a trying on session with my mum and sister and it was just normal. I tried the first one on and showed them and they gave me their thoughts on it, and then I tried the next one. It was just a completely normal thing for me to be trying on dresses and there wasn't really any reaction from them about it being a big deal or anything.

I think I really appreciate that. Like it's nice to get the big 'wow' moment where everyone's kind of shocked and supportive (hopefully). But it was really nice for it to just be nothing and them react as if I'd been wearing dresses my whole life.

I did get a 'wow' moment later anyway. On my birthday a week later was the first time I wore a dress in front of my whole family. My dad and brother didn't say much, but they were supportive, they just kind of accepted it straight away. My sister-in-law, when she first saw me said ""wow, those legs really go all the way up don't they."" which is dumb, but it made me feel good and I'll always remember that. Then she commented how well I filled out the dress and later did my makeup and hair for me. My mum and sister kept saying they were jealous of how good I looked, it was pretty much the best day of my life so far.

Anyway, just felt like sharing.

Like it\'s nice to get the big \'wow\' moment where everyone\'s kind of shocked and supportive (hopefully). But it was really nice for it to just be nothing and them react as if I\'d been wearing dresses my whole life.\n\nI did get a \'wow\' moment later anyway. On my birthday a week later was the first time I wore a dress in front of my whole family. My dad and brother didn\'t say much, but they were supportive, they just kind of accepted it straight away. My sister-in-law, when she first saw me said ""wow, those legs really go all the way up don\'t they."" which is dumb, but it made me feel good and I\'ll always remember that. Then she commented how well I filled out the dress and later did my makeup and hair for me. My mum and sister kept saying they were jealous of how good I looked, it was pretty much the best day of my life so far.\n\nAnyway, just felt like sharing.\n\nTL;DR: My mum and sister didn\'t really react at all, for them it was just a totally normal thing for me to present female, even though it was the first time.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I just realised I've forgotten my mum and sister's first reaction to me presenting as female, but that's ok."", 'created': 1593514567.0}"

This is sort-of an update on my por from a month-ish ago, I finally came out as MTF to my wife and friends.

Wife's reaction was as bad as expected, considering she is straight and religious, can't fault her really I knew what I was getting into.

My friends and coworkers however have been massively supportive.

I‚Äôm a bi white cis male. I am perfectly content with my sex, but I also have an interest in the trans community.  I consider myself accepting of others for who they are and try to be kind to everyone I can. 

However, I didn‚Äôt always used to be like that.

Years before I was the exact opposite, and I held a lot of negative and hateful views. I was very hurtful, pessimistic, and miserable. That changed very recently, and now I‚Äôm hoping to clear the air and ask these questions in order for me to get a better understanding about the community.

1. What makes a trans woman a trans woman and a trans man a trans man?

-This question has been brought to light thanks to J.K. Rowling‚Äôs comments (more on that later). I guess what confuses me the most about this is the terminology. I‚Äôm never sure if when I‚Äôm talking to a trans man, I‚Äôm talking to someone who considers themselves a man or a woman. The terminology confuses me. I used slang terms for so long thanks to porn sites, (like she-male and cunt-boy). Sorry if that offended, but it was back when I considered trans people more of a fetish than anything. Again, not who I am now. The terms ‚Äúmtf‚Äù and ‚Äúftm‚Äù are clearer to me, but I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a better way to understand the phrasing.

2. What does dysphoria feel like?

-I used to say that dysphoria was just a mental illness. I realize now I was wrong. That being said, I‚Äôm confident in my body, and have never felt dysphoria before. What‚Äôs the best way to describe the feeling to a cis person?

3. What exactly did J.K. Rowling do that was so bad?

-This is just me being ignorant of the terminology again. I‚Äôm not defending her, but I‚Äôm confused as to why her comments caused such an uproar. 

and 4. What made the subs that recently got banned so bad? 

-Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm glad to see subs like r/The_Donald removed. But other ones were taken down that I hadn‚Äôt heard of at all. Upon scrolling through this and other trans-related subs, I found out that a lot of them were anti-trans. Which begs the question: What exactly is anti-trans? This is kind of a question within a question, but I‚Äôm not sure what a lot of these subs did or promoted to get banned because I hadn‚Äôt heard of them. Did they just bash trans people, make trans jokes, or promote violence against them? Please let me know.

Overall, I have changed. I‚Äôm a much happier, optimistic, and loving person now compared to what I was until recently. But I still have work to do in order to change my thought process.

I consider myself accepting of others for who they are and try to be kind to everyone I can. \n\nHowever, I didn‚Äôt always used to be like that.\n\nYears before I was the exact opposite, and I held a lot of negative and hateful views. I was very hurtful, pessimistic, and miserable. That changed very recently, and now I‚Äôm hoping to clear the air and ask these questions in order for me to get a better understanding about the community.\n\n1. What makes a trans woman a trans woman and a trans man a trans man?\n\n-This question has been brought to light thanks to J.K. Rowling‚Äôs comments (more on that later). I guess what confuses me the most about this is the terminology. I‚Äôm never sure if when I‚Äôm talking to a trans man, I‚Äôm talking to someone who considers themselves a man or a woman. The terminology confuses me. I used slang terms for so long thanks to porn sites. It was back when I considered trans people more of a fetish than anything. Again, not who I am now. The terms ‚Äúmtf‚Äù and ‚Äúftm‚Äù are clearer to me, but I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a better way to understand the phrasing.\n\n2. What does dysphoria feel like?\n\n-I used to say that dysphoria was just a mental illness. I realize now I was wrong. That being said, I‚Äôm confident in my body, and have never felt dysphoria before. What‚Äôs the best way to describe the feeling to a cis person?\n\n3. What exactly did J.K. Rowling do that was so bad?\n\n-This is just me being ignorant of the terminology again. I‚Äôm not defending her, but I‚Äôm confused as to why her comments caused such an uproar. \n\nand 4.

I've been debating saying this because I dont want it to be taken wrong and used by TERFs as propaganda, but seeing as their sub was banned I feel a little safer saying this.



I wore a binder for about a year when I was 17 and coming to terms with my gender identity- which brought waves of dismorphia. I wore it all day and most nights, if I could have bathed in it I would have. I exercised, swam, carried heavy luggage in it. I do not regret buying or wearing a binder, not for a second.


After about six months I began to have quite bad back pain along my spine from my ribs to the bottom of my shoulders. I did research and did the typical exercises to try to stretch this area of my back out ( using a wall to force my shoulder blades back, or my spine forward, in gentle repetition) but the pain persisted. My family said it may be my binder, but they werent on board with me wearing it so I dismissed them and assumed it was just growing pains.

A year or so after wearing my binder full time I put on a bra again. I was confused about the emotions I felt, but *not confused about my identity*. I wasnt the gender I was born as, but being a full time male didnt fit me either. I felt happiest somewhere inbetween. My back pain slowly eased a little, but I didn't associate it with the binder. 


Four years have passed and I found out that I developed ""mild thoracic scoliosis"" at some point in my teens. I had an MRI for an unrelated back pain which revealed between then an my last MRI aged 15ish my spine had curved in the area my binder compressed most (breast tissue) and where my pain at that time had been. If I had been seeing a more trans competent doctor, or worn a binder later, I may have realised what was happening sooner and been able to do something. 


So yeah, please be safe when binding. I absolutely endorse it for top dismorphia, but I can not stress enough that if your body is still growing you need to be extra careful. I cant be sure it was my binder, but I want to ask anyone still growing (under 21) who wears a binder to please ask either google, a trans positive doctor, or a safe ally, about how to keep your safe safe while you do bind.

I was confused about the emotions I felt, but *not confused about my identity*. I wasnt the gender I was born as, but being a full time male didnt fit me either. I felt happiest somewhere inbetween. My back pain slowly eased a little, but I didn\'t associate it with the binder. \n\n\nFour years have passed and I found out that I developed ""mild thoracic scoliosis"" at some point in my teens. I had an MRI for an unrelated back pain which revealed between then an my last MRI aged 15ish my spine had curved in the area my binder compressed most (breast tissue) and where my pain at that time had been. If I had been seeing a more trans competent doctor, or worn a binder later, I may have realised what was happening sooner and been able to do something. \n\n\nSo yeah, please be safe when binding. I absolutely endorse it for top dismorphia, but I can not stress enough that if your body is still growing you need to be extra careful. I cant be sure it was my binder, but I want to ask anyone still growing (under 21) who wears a binder to please ask either google, a trans positive doctor, or a safe ally, about how to keep your safe safe while you do bind. That\'s all. Thank you‚ù§', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""PSA if you're binding as a young person!"", 'created': 1593574072.0}"
