I just need a place to hopefully get some input and to let out some of my feelings.

So I’m a cis female. I’m fine identifying as a female, although some days I wish I was born male.

Now I don’t think I have dysphoria or anything but I would admire a lot of trans and non-binary people.

For example, there’s this trans guy that I follow on social media and I look up to him in a way? Not in a creepy sexual/romantic fetish way, in a way where kids see a superhero and want to be like them when they grow up.

I’ve always felt this connection with trans/non-binary news, media, people etc. I brush it off as a really strong support.

Anyways, I just wanted to get this off of my chest. I think this is a pretty normal thing for a cis girl.

I remember once thinking I could be trans, then non-binary then all these other labels but I think I’m just gender nonconforming.

I wouldn’t want to surgically or medically transition to be male, rather be born male. Even then some days I would kinda wanna be see as neutral/mix of both. But I think this all had to do with gender expression and I need to not confuse that with gender IDENTITY.

I tried experimenting with pronouns, I like they/them over he/him but I’m so used to using she/her that I pushed pronoun experimentation to the side.

2020-02-02 04:06:24,exink1,4,1,"Content warning: weight-related/eating disorder

Hi team! 

So I started HRT (testosterone) last March 2018, which would mean I have been on it almost a year. I was on 20mg/ml but now I'm on 30mg/ml. I have always struggled with dysphoria as well as poor body image and an eating disorder. Like a lot of folks, I think they kind of exacerbated each other. 

With that background in mind, I now get to my current conundrum. 

I've gained about 40lbs and now I am 180lbs. It's by no means a super high number, but it is high for me. I used to be able to consciously eat and not work out and I would even out around 140-150lbs, but no matter what I do with my eating, I'm just not losing weight. 

I know I should also be working out, but I've been in the worst depression of my life which is making it hard to motivate so I've been eating a 1650 calorie, high protein diet. I'm still eating carbs and fats because I don't believe in giving those up. I adhere to a macro diet at 50% carbs, 20% fat, and 30% protein (though I usually do more protein and less carbs, those are just my base tracking numbers). 

None of my clothing fits me anymore. I've gone up a size and I'm very frustrated, primarily because I don't have more than two pairs of pants that fit and I have maybe 4 work shirts that fit. 

QUESTIONS:
- Has anyone else encountered this? 
- Is it harder to lose weight on T? Or is this the weight I'm meant to be on?
- Does anyone else work with a macro diet? Do I need to adjust my percentages? I was basing this on when I did a macro diet before T. 
- Are there resources out there that are worth looking into for this?",trans,Question for people on T...,1580641584.0,"{'created_utc': 1580616384, 'id': 'exink1', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Content warning: weight-related/eating disorder\n\nHi team! \n\nSo I started HRT (testosterone) last March 2018, which would mean I have been on it almost a year.

This is my first post here. I usually just spend my time here in awe at how inspiring all of you amazing people are, but i'm close to starting HRT and i'm wondering if I could get some general advice on a specific concern I have.

Does anyone know if HRT can stop this or better yet help the lost hair grow back?

2020-02-03 06:06:39,ey2jcy,2,1,"I've been in a limbo for the past year about who I am and what I truly identify with in terms of gender.

I'm a 19F who has always been very masculine. As a kid, I was labeled a ""tomboy"" and found any excuse to go to the boys section to find clothes (now I go to the mens section). I always went to the boys section for toys (still do, but that's just where the Legos are 😉) and never had anything to do with make up. 

My mom made me wear make up when I started middle school (just some foundation and slight blush) because I was entering the next phase of my life as I matured, but I only complied for about a week before I stopped. Make up always made me feel like I was wearing a mask on my face to cover who I was, and even to this day, I do not own a single make up product.

It wasn't until I was in my junior year of high school when I finally built up the courage to ask my kom if I could cut my hair. Up until that point, it had been either shoulder length or chin length, and I hated it. I wanted to ask sooner, but I had been in dance for eight years not too long before (1st through 8th grade) and couldn't cut it in order to keep the unity. Thankfully, she let me get it cut to my desired length/style (picture a mid 2000s Drake Bell haircut), and felt more myself.

One thing that I can't change as easily as a trip to a hair salon is my chest. I have the misfortune of having a rather large chest size (42DDD for those curious) and find it extremely difficult to genuinely feel comfortable in the mens clothing I wear. I have to be cautious of my chest size when getting any type of shirt whether t-shirt or dress shirt. I have considered a binder, but with my large chest, I don't know if I can overcome my dysphoria. I would consider top surgery, but I am in no way able to afford it now or soon. The closest I can get is breat reduction surgery (which I am in the process of losing weight for) that hopefully will reduce my dysphoria and still satisfy my parents.

I am absolutely terrified to talk to either my friends or my family about what I'm going through, mainly because I don't even know what's going on myself. I'm completely lost in terms of who I am and should be. There are parts to being a female I don't mind, but every time I go somewhere, I find myself comparing my body/composure to guys. When I go to the gym, I'm not checking out the guys, but wishing I had the same body structure they did.

I'm so lost and confused and am desperately holding on to my sanity and not become depressed over this confusion, but I don't know how much longer I can last.

If anyone has any advise/support/anything to help me out or questions about myself that are possibly unclear, I greatly appreciate it.

i play a coed sport for my high school. i live in one of the states attempting to push lots of anti-trans legislature.

and i’m in the closet. only out to two friends, plus one of their parents. but i plan to come out to my parents in around a month.

anyway, title is self explanatory. one of the assistant coaches has been pushing for a girls’ team and i don’t know whether or not it’s gonna happen, but for me personally, it sucks. here’s why:

1) new legislature in my state will prevent me from ever playing for the team

2) there’s no reason at all for it to not be coed. some of our best players are cis girls

3) one of my two allies is a cis girl who’s on the team with me, and i don’t want us to get split during this upcoming season because i’m gonna need as much support from her as i can get when i’m going through the process of coming out to my parents and hopefully coming out publicly shortly thereafter.

it also doesn’t even make sense. they’d barely even have enough players to make a team and half of them would be beginners. all the girls i’ve talked to are opposed to the idea of playing on a girls team. but it sounds like it’s gonna happen anyway.

i just don’t know how to express the way this will personally affect me to my coaches. ideally i don’t wanna have to come out to them, and even if i did, idk how to say “hey so this girls team thing makes me feel bad about myself so you shouldn’t do it” because that makes me sound like a brat

2020-02-05 21:19:37,ezgo6e,7,1,"I'm a member of the local kink community. They hold a  munch once a month and we all meet in the pub. It's a nice night out and I don't have much opportunity to socialise otherwise. Last year, I started seeing someone from there - it lasted about a month and then I ended it. I gave her some crappy excuses but the real reason is that I just don't want to be in a relationship right now. 

I'm trans, but I'm also pre-everything, and I'm sometimes struggling to stop pretending to be super masculine and I sometimes feel like I don't even know who I am. I'm struggling with a lot of identity stuff right now and I've got some baggage from an abusive relationship I was in that I'm trying to work through. But I didn't want to get into all this with her, so I made up some crappy excuses. I didn't handle it very well tbh. 

I stopped going to munches for about 6 months because I figured she'd be there. Turns out she stopped going for six months for the same reason and we both went back for the first time last night. 

She hounded me. I was trying to be sociable with everyone but she kept trying to get me to go off and chat about us. I felt bad about how I handled things and she's a nice person so I agreed and we had this awful talk that left me feeling shit. 

She wanted us to get together. I told her I'm not interested in a relationship. She asked if I liked her, I said she's awesome and hopefully we can be friends. She kept on at me and eventually I told her that I was trans and then the evening got really bad. 

Her: So you're sexually attracted to men?

Me: No, it's not about sexuality, it's about gender. I'm sexually attracted to women. 

Her: You're not trans then.

Me: It's not about sexuality. Lesbians aren't men. 

Her: I don't think you'll ever be a woman.

Me: Are you being transphobic or what do you mean?

Her: I don't think you'll go through with it. I don't think you'll do it. You're not trans.

Me: No, I am.

Her: Nah, you're not. 

Me: I've wrestled with this for years, spent countless hours of therapy going over it. I'm trans.

Her: No, you're very masculine.

Me: I act very masculine. 

Her: It's not an act. 

Me: It is.

Her: You got your surgery booked?

Me: It doesn't work like that. I'm on a waiting list to go to a gender clinic where I might hopefully get hormones. The waiting list is several years long. (UK). I won't get surgery for years. 

Her: You can't be trans because you got hard when we had sex. I know a gay guy and he doesn't get hard when he's with women. 

Me: It doesn't work like that. Besides, I'm attracted to women. 

Her: So you want someone to have anal sex with you?

Me: Fuck no. I tried that and it really hurts. 

Her: You're not trans then. 

Me: It's nothing to do with what kind of sex you like. It's about gender. 

Her: I don't know what you want. 

This went on for basically three hours. I should have given up long before then. I should have spent time with other people I know. But I'm not out yet and I felt like I owed her something after how I ended things with her. 

But it was so tiring and I feel so shit today. I've only told a few people and they've all been super nice and this is the first time I've dealt with something like this. And I feel really shitty now. And I'm gonna have to tell people in the future and it could go like this and the little happy bubble of acceptance I lived in has burst and I don't even know why I wrote this except I just... well, fuck it, I just want a hug, really.

2020-02-06 10:27:37,ezqhz2,2,1,"So...I have a question. Is it normal to have like one name and then another? 


I'm bad at explaining things when I should be sleeping. Lol. Some of things may be being repeated from other posts on here. Sorry. 


My birth name is James Michael. I have always hated it. I am a writer and I love cool and unique names. James and Michael are two of the most boring and generic names out there...plus, they are super masculine names...which has always felt wrong...even before my recent realization.


My aunt came up with the name Daylin Knight as a play on words because my mom and birth father are as different as day and night. My mom is the nicest person you'll ever meet and my birth father (James) is a mean person who was always quick to jealousy, violence, and anger. He went out for beer when I was 10 weeks old and never came back. He called me once when I was 15 and tried to steal my identity. That was 17 years ago and I haven't talked to him since. So, that probably fueled my hatred of the name a bit more. Lol. 


But, I always loved Daylin Knight. I used it everywhere online, wrote under it, and finally got most people in my life to call me it. It's even on my nametag and the schedule at work.


Then I discovered I was trans and everything all of a sudden made sense. Unfortunately, Daylin didn't feel right anymore because it is a unisex name that is more commonly masculine. 


In a perfect world, I would have been born as a girl and lived my whole life as a girly goth girl. I'm talking long black hair, black make-up, and black dresses and skirts. Lol. I mean...look at my profile pic. Lol. 


I'm not masculine...like at all. Heck, I have been made fun of all my life for my handshake being 'unmanly'. Lol. My appearance is masculine though...and I hate it. I hate hair everywhere, except the head. I would never wanna hurt a fly, but all anyone sees is a big bald guy...even more so before I shaved my beard. So, my inner femininity is automatically blocked by my masculine appearance.


Due to this, I wanted to distance myself from anything masculine. While I was researching a new name like crazy, a name kept jumping out at me. It is a name that I have always loved and while it is also unisex, it tends to lean more feminine.


That name was Raven. From there, I found an epic middle name that fit with it and formed the new name of Raven Astraea. 


So…
James Michael to Daylin Knight to Raven Astraea.


My friend described Daylin as like a transitional name. 


I hate James. Being called it causes instant pain, sadness, and anger. Daylin causes happiness and joy. But, Raven causes straight up euphoria.


Most people in my life call me Daylin, but some call me Raven and it feels so right every time.


So, I guess my question is...is it normal to change your preferred name over the course of figuring yourself out?

So, that probably fueled my hatred of the name a bit more. Lol.\xa0\n\n\nBut, I always loved Daylin Knight. I used it everywhere online, wrote under it, and finally got most people in my life to call me it. It's even on my nametag and the schedule at work.\n\n\nThen I discovered I was trans and everything all of a sudden made sense. Unfortunately, Daylin didn't feel right anymore because it is a unisex name that is more commonly masculine.\xa0\n\n\nIn a perfect world, I would have been born as a girl and lived my whole life as a girly goth girl. I'm talking long black hair, black make-up, and black dresses and skirts. Lol. I mean...look at my profile pic. Lol.\xa0\n\n\nI'm not masculine...like at all. Heck, I have been made fun of all my life for my handshake being 'unmanly'. Lol. My appearance is masculine though...and I hate it. I hate hair everywhere, except the head. I would never wanna hurt a fly, but all anyone sees is a big bald guy...even more so before I shaved my beard. So, my inner femininity is automatically blocked by my masculine appearance.\n\n\nDue to this, I wanted to distance myself from anything masculine. While I was researching a new name like crazy, a name kept jumping out at me. It is a name that I have always loved and while it is also unisex, it tends to lean more feminine.\n\n\nThat name was Raven. From there, I found an epic middle name that fit with it and formed the new name of Raven Astraea.\xa0\n\n\nSo…\nJames Michael to Daylin Knight to Raven Astraea.\n\n\nMy friend described Daylin as like a transitional name.\xa0\n\n\nI hate James. Being called it causes instant pain, sadness, and anger. Daylin causes happiness and joy. But, Raven causes straight up euphoria.\n\n\nMost people in my life call me Daylin, but some call me Raven and it feels so right every time.\n\n\nSo, I guess my question is...is it normal to change your preferred name over the course of figuring yourself out?\xa0\n\n\nSorry it's so long winded...that's just how I explain things..."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Multiple Name Changes?', 'created': 1581010057.0}"

2020-02-06 21:59:27,ezzxr2,5,1,"(Sry if you’ve already seen this somewhere else, I’m desperately looking for support) So, I'm a 16yo living in the UK, and my school (which is meant to be a fairly accepting school, but also has a rule that boys can’t have more than 4 inches of hair) has finally changed a set of uniform rules which made life really hard for transgender people to transition, and received a letter because 'the torment I was made to go through' (my headteacher's words, not mine). If you wanna know how that happened, be aware that this isn't a long post, but not a short one either.

So. The head of sports (who only gets involved with the admin, and so didn’t know about what happened) at my school, who I know fairly well, finally allowed me to do netball, the 'girls' option' for games starting from this term. For people who haven't had an education in the UK, games is a sport we do two afternoons a week, of which one is generally a match against another school (although the UK netball body doesn't allow to participate in them, which I'm fine with). I wasn't feeling very confident going into the first session, but I was with a group of friends so I got through it without any incidents, and felt great as I changed back into my tracksuit (going back into the boys' changing rooms in netball kit, which looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/eW8pyM0](https://imgur.com/a/eW8pyM0) would have been committing suicide). At that point, however, a football coach came in and asked what I was doing fooling around at netball in GIRLS' KIT! So the conversation we have goes like this:

Me: I've changed my sports option to netball. My name is on the register.

Him: Netball is a girl's sport! You're a boy!

Me: How do you know? (yes I'm cocky and my dysphoria levels are too high for mental sanity)

Him: Well........ The school sees you as a boy (the school knows I'm trans, but doesn't really do much about it), so I assume you should be in football kit, and doing football.

Me: And even if I were to be seen as a boy, how come I would have to do netball?

At this point, the teacher didn't get the hint, and snapped. So he told me to attend boys' sport in boys' kit without fail for the rest of the term. I knew that that would have pushed me over the edge (which I've been close to for the past year and a half or so, so it feels almost bearable at this point), so I sent him an email which essentially said that his attitude was completely inappropriate in a school which prides itself in its 'integralist ethos' and all that bs. The next morning, my tutor (a teacher who registers and deals with the admin-y stuff for about 14 pupils) says he wants to have a chat with me. At this point, I should point out that he's a great guy, who's super catholic and was completely anti-trans to begin with, but was willing to learn about the whole thing, and is helping me so much with my transition. So, he asks me to chat with him, and I've realised that the football coach must have emailed him about what happened during games. He also realises that I’m not going to swap games options, and decides to help me in whichever way he can.

So, the next games session, I go to netball again. It’s really fun, and I’m starting to get beat the level of the other girls who have played it for years. But, as promised, the football coach comes back again, and gives me a tutor’s detention (the most basic detention, just 1 hour picking up rubbish around school), which I can skive off anyways. Sooo, I make sure he knows that I’m still not going to change sports choices. The next session, I notice the guy trying to catch me as I exit the boys’ changing rooms, so I switch to a different changing room. Needless to say, this pisses him off BIG-TIME, so the guy, at the end of the session, decides to give me a div-head’s, the next level up in terms of detentions. At this point, the guy is really on my nerves, my dysphoria is sky-high and I’m just about holding in my tears, so I break and call him a ‘fucking dickhead’ (for reference, I barely ever swear) and storm off into the changing rooms, where he’s not allowed to go. 

So he gets me suspended. (This was on a Saturday, so my suspension is for Monday to Tuesday)

Now, my parents would kill me for that, so I spend the weekend panicking, my dysphoria blowing up, ripping out my body hair, not eating, and trying to find an excuse to pretend to my parents I’m ill. But, on the Sunday evening, I get an official-looking letter, and I’m not really in the mood to open it. But.... seeing as it might distract me from my body hair, I do.

It turns out I’m the jammiest (edit: this means luckiest, sry to the Americans out there) person alive, and that my headteacher checks out all the head’s detentions (the highest level of detention), suspensions and expulsions. So when she had a look at my case, she realised that the football coach was a dick, and reverted my suspension. 

So now, all pupils are allowed to take part in any sport, in any kit (although nobody has used that rule apart from a few girls wearing shorts and some more who have started football, but change starts small in a school with over 1000 people), and hair restrictions have been relaxed. 

I guess thanks for reading my stupidly long and emotion-packed TED talk, and I hope this might inspire some of you to make your lives slightly better. Just saying though, in terms of dysphoria, anxiety, and depression, this was NOT AT ALL worth it. I’m now in a shit state of mental health because the NHS can’t get their shit together for HRT, I don’t and I’m never gonna get remotely close to passing, life is shot, I’m hairy, and the bridge next to my home is beckoning to me in a way I’m pretty sure is not very healthy.

Growing up me and my sister were pretty close, there was almost 10 years between us so I helped look after her.
There was some things that happened to her that I'll not go into here, but it wasn't nice.
After I moved out I became a total recluse, barely talked to family, etc.
Over time I hear more stories about how my sister is lashing out, etc. Typical teenage stuff, but some kind of extreme. 
So at one of the birthdays I can back home to visit for I notice alot of the friends are of varying identities, ok, whatever, kids these days, I think.

Couple years go by and shit goes down for me, I moved back home, it's nice to be with family again, but my sister is having a tough time for various reasons, I try to help but heck knows how, especially with self harm. 

One time she goes missing, not the first, but never good. 
Eventually I get a call from her that she tried to take her own life, again, get shit sorted, hear from authorities that she's safe. 
I visit her in the hospital and basically just ask, what the f*ck?
So begins the most arduous 45 min conversation of our lives, not for the content but for the dancing around of the issue.

Eventually comes out that she feels trans.... My answer. ""I really don't give a fu*k about that, if that's how you feel then I'll support that, I'm still pissed you tried to take your own life, it really didn't need to get this far""
Put slightly more eloquently here.

I knew that about 2 years ago but never came out for the fact that i wanted to if i would ""still be a boy"", even tho pretty much since a child i had this felling that i would fit more with the boys then with the girls but everything went down when puberty started and last year i got into a pretty deep into depression and knowing i was trans was one of the things that messed with my head.  
Anyways, here's how i'm planing to come out to my parents:  
I want to gather then in the living room, they're going to sit on the couch and i'm going to sit on a chair in front of them. Then i'm just gonna tell them i'm a transgender dude, i made my research and tried to educate myself as much as i could to awnser any question they might have.

2020-02-07 16:22:42,f0cr46,2,1,"Hi I’m a little confused and need help.

I know I can’t possibly cover everything in this post, and that I really need to talk to a therapist but for now I want to ask someone whose trans if they had a similar experience to me. 

So basically since I was 4 I’ve had thoughts of wanting to be a girl. They weren’t overwhelming thoughts though. But I would sneak into my mom’s closet and try on her clothes and lingerie and love it. Over the years I would steal her panties to wear under my clothes and sleep in. Ever since I first started watching porn imagined myself as the girl and wanted to be her. It wasn’t a gradual thing either the very first time I watched it I imagined being the girl and haven’t stopped after all these years. 

I know that sounds obvious but here’s what makes me confused. First off I’m straight. I never look at a man and think I want that. I always notice attractive girls and want them. When I am fantasizing about being a girl and having sex the man never has a face because I’ve never seen a man I’m attracted to in real life. I also fantasize about being a woman and having sex with another woman. Something I also think about all the time is being kidnapped and being forced to transition into a woman by someone and being like oh well I get to live as a woman now. The last thing is I don’t hate being male or my male body. I’m just not sure if I’m happy being a guy or just content and would be happier as a woman. The thought of being a woman is something that has always gnawed at me, and for some reason at being 27 years old it starting to get more intense.

When I was around 8 I experienced a lot of physical abuse, and also began to question what my life would be like as the other gender. I would again question my gender for several years from then on before I told myself I was cis. Recently however I've been able to attend more sexually accepting schools and it brought me to question my gender. So here's my problem. I fear I might believe I'm trans because of the physical abuse I suffered at 8. I fear I'm associating the trauma I suffered with my gender and I'm believing being trans is my escape. However nowadays I prefer to grow my hair out and I'm genuinely happy with how I look with longer hair. My family is also extremely Christian, and shunned my sister for a little while when she came out herself, so I'm a bit weary to come out as feeling trans. My friend group is pretty accepting but I'm afraid I might have cemented myself as cis-asexual because that's what I tell people to avoid talking about my sexuality when I'm conflicted.

So as an all-together; I don't have a supportive family, I fear I might be associating trauma with gender and am using the idea of being trans as an escape, and I don't feel like I can tell anyone without this anonymity because of what I've told my friends.

2020-02-10 05:22:40,f1loo2,4,1,"Hello All,

I have a question I'm hoping to open up to discussion. I was directed to this sub.

I, in my teenage years, thought that I was trans and started on my path to transitioning. Right before I started hormones I realized this was not what I wanted and stopped everything. 

I really hated my female body back then. I was so uncomfortable with it and cried nearly every day. I wanted out and transitioning made so much sense. I liked ""boy"" things. I always hated being female and puberty was traumatic. The pieces fit together for me and my therapist at the time agreed that it sounded like gender dysphoria and had given me the green light to continue to hormone therapy.

About three years ago, 7 or so years later, I was having a conversation with my husband and he pointed out that an unrelated memory I was sharing was uncomfortable to listen to. He said that it sounded a lot like sexual abuse. It raised a red flag for me and for the past 3 years I've had a lot of flashbacks and realized that, yes, there was a lot of sexual abuse when I was a young girl. 

It started to raise the question for me: Was my desire to transition me trying to escape my body? Did I hate being female, or did I hate that my body had been violated and that the male in the abuse had the power? Did I really ever want to transition, or did I subconsciously want to escape the constant nagging that my body was not okay and I needed to leave it behind?

I didn't consciously know about the abuse back then, but if I had, would it have changed things? Would my therapist have been more skeptical about transitioning?

My question to this community is: How can one know wether their desire to transition is from gender dysphoria or repressed bodily abuse? Or another way to phrase it: Can sexual abuse look like gender dysphoria on the outside?

I'm not saying that transitioning is wrong or that all desire to transition stems from abuse, but I'm asking wether this has been brought up before, the similarities, and if so, what's being done to potentially help others like myself?

I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way. I just need to know if there are others like me. It was such a scary and confusing time. I'd appreciate any feedback on the subject.

My(24f) partner/future legal wife(22TF) (not signing the paperwork for a couple more years, but wives in all other aspects) came out as trans last October. I'm very queer so that wasn't a problem, but I've been doing a Thing since she came out of giving her experiences she missed out on growing up. We're pagans and are part of a group that does rituals, and part of one I did recently needed Maenads to act as flower girls for a mock-wedding between some friends of ours. She didn't get to be a flower girl at a wedding when she was five, so I offered her the part which she loved.

Anyways, he's the father of my best friend of 10 years. I'm only 20 and my biological father passed when I was 7 or 8. This isn't a topic I've brought up to either my BF or him but I figured I would bring it up with him first because I trust his insight a bit more on the topic.

He's known me awhile and in the past, mostly when I was younger, I'd have ""phases"" where I'd be pretty interested in something. I suppose that's normal for everyone, I still have my main hobbies but I won't deny my interests in things change over time.

Now this is something that I've always considered a part of me. Ever since I was a kid on the internet, I would almost exclusively go as the opposite gender when I was allowed to remain anonymous/not my assigned identity. It felt so natural and in the countless video games that offered the opportunity to play as a woman, that's always the path I took. 

For awhile I thought I was just CIS/hetero but after having been in a few relationships with women, I had never felt any real... interest.. visually? Anyways, I've just told close friends and myself that I'm asexual. Same also goes for guys but part of why I don't like other guys bodies is because I'm not the hugest fan of my own. I'm not particularly unattractive either, it's just what makes up the male form is a lot less... cool? than what makes up the female form. I find a lot of beauty and longing for the female form but not in some primitive sex oriented sense I suppose. There's a sense of normalcy to it I can't describe.

TL;DR how did you decide it ""wasn't a phase"" and do you have any input? 
I told him that if I could be reborn, I'd definitely choose to be a woman because I know I'm not the hugest fan of being a guy.

I also really hope I don't come off as offensive or hurt anyones feelings, this is simply coming from someone who's been really ignorant and closeted their whole life.",trans,My father figure asked me how I know it's not a phase,1581393981.0,"{'created_utc': 1581368781, 'id': 'f1wx3b', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'To start off, this isn\'t exactly what he said.

I suppose that\'s normal for everyone, I still have my main hobbies but I won\'t deny my interests in things change over time.\n\nNow this is something that I\'ve always considered a part of me. Ever since I was a kid on the internet, I would almost exclusively go as the opposite gender when I was allowed to remain anonymous/not my assigned identity. It felt so natural and in the countless video games that offered the opportunity to play as a woman, that\'s always the path I took. \n\nFor awhile I thought I was just CIS/hetero but after having been in a few relationships with women, I had never felt any real... interest.. visually? Anyways, I\'ve just told close friends and myself that I\'m asexual. Same also goes for guys but part of why I don\'t like other guys bodies is because I\'m not the hugest fan of my own. I\'m not particularly unattractive either, it\'s just what makes up the male form is a lot less... cool? than what makes up the female form. I find a lot of beauty and longing for the female form but not in some primitive sex oriented sense I suppose. There\'s a sense of normalcy to it I can\'t describe.\n\nTL;DR how did you decide it ""wasn\'t a phase"" and do you have any input? \nI told him that if I could be reborn, I\'d definitely choose to be a woman because I know I\'m not the hugest fan of being a guy.\n\nI also really hope I don\'t come off as offensive or hurt anyones feelings, this is simply coming from someone who\'s been really ignorant and closeted their whole life.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""My father figure asked me how I know it's not a phase"", 'created': 1581393981.0}"

I have mild gender dysphoria and when I am in my safe space I always tend to question myself and generally feel bad when I am told I am male. I just want to hack this worm off my body and start hormones!

I don't know what I should do, I can't speak to a therapist here and I can't get HRT.

It started with how I dressed (I’ve preferred masculine clothes my whole life, not once have I felt comfortable in a skirt) then I cut my hair and started dressing as masculine as possible. Finally around the start of summer I got a binder and men’s swimwear, and at the start of the school year I officially started using a masculine name and pronouns. 
But since then I haven’t done much apart from trying keep up the image. My mom has already told me she isn’t comfortable with me having top surgery because she’s worried I might regret it or the surgery might go wrong, plus they tend to be more expensive than we are able to spare, and thus I doubt she’ll let me start hormones. But I am self conscious about my voice. Thus I tend to be very quiet at school to avoid strangers noticing. I’m much less self conscious about my body. I was blessed with a very masculine face and thick eyebrows, and I wear loose clothes to cover my chest and legs as much as I can, but I feel it’s not enough.

I am feeling a little in over my head and hoping someone can throw me a lifeline as I try to support one of my high school athletes. Thanks in advance!
I am a high school aquatics coach in California, CIF section, just starting the competitive swim season there. One of my athletes, who has been competing with the girls teams for several years, approached me today and told me they would be transitioning, had planned top surgery, and would like to participate on the boys team this year, including requests to use the boys locker room and wear a speedo instead of a girls suit. 
Personally, I am supportive of this athlete and would do anything to provide them the opportunity to participate and succeed in whatever way they want. 
This person's mother is unsupportive of the transition, and unaware of plans for surgery or goals to compete with the boys team. 
Our school's athletic director is currently researching applicable federal, state, district, and section policies to make sure we can be legally compliant (he is also on board with being as supportive and compassionate as possible while maintaining a legally defensible position).
Any advice, personal experience, or other input is welcome. I am realizing that in my capacity as head coach, it is not always enough to be compassionate and supportive, I also need to educate myself and am working to do so now!

Currently, I'm not out at work but at home I've been out for about 2 years.v

It has really been taking it out of me recently. It's exhausting trying to progress in my transition at night and then in the morning pretending to be someone else for 10-12 hours.

I'm a pre-everything transgirl. I have been out of a relationship for nearly a year, and thats fine, and there was nothing bad about the breakup, but its donned on me now that I kind of, cant date? Being pre-everything I fear that I am not in a real position to be a SO to many people. I present mostly as a guy at the moment, and hope to change that soon. But that being said, im moving very slowly along the transitional timeline. I really have been tiptoeing and taking my time with all of this, and therefore, have recently started to feel a bit... lonely. Like I said, its been a minute since ive been in an actual relationship and I am beginning to miss having that other half. I fear that not many people want to date someone who is ""dynamic"", because if i present myself as a guy, thats simply not true bc I really wont be for a lot longer, and I definitely dont want to lie. On the other hand though I cant really say I'm a girl to someone bc i dont really present as one yet, as im still closeted to my family and am Pre-everything.

So from my sociology class we learned that gender is essentially a social construct. Gender roles are enforced from the moment a child is born. So wearing pink, playing with barbies, etc. is associated with being a girl.

It feels so good, especially since the process is so terrifying.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'In appreciation of a very supportive coworker', 'created': 1581654108.0}"

Basically for a lot of my life I’ve fantasized about being a boy/man. 
For a lot of my childhood I dressed like a boy, wished to be referred to as a boy etc. 
I got into really girly stuff once I hit puberty, I still wondered and wished how my life would be if I was a guy, but never entertained or acted on it. 
I’m over 18 now, and I still get these feelings.
Lately I’ve been really questioning myself, would I be happier as a man? 
The one reason I’m telling myself it’s not real, and I’m happy as a woman is because I like my curvy figure, my boobs, my big hips etc. 
but I feel like there’s a disconnect with my body and mind. 
When I look at me, I don’t see me? I see someone who’s got a feminine body? 
I’m sorry if this is silly, I just don’t know what to do :((

2020-02-15 03:06:11,f43i2s,19,1,"I am not sure why people feel the need to switch genders. 

I feel like it is a supplemental action and not a solution to a deeper issue that is going on. For example, think of a person who seeks plastic surgery because they are not comfortable in their own body. They go through the surgery and look different, but they are still the same person on the inside. Yes, they may be more secure and confident. Yet, has it really solved the issue of insecurity of their own appearance? I do not think it truly has addressed the issue of insecurity.

When it comes to a trans person, I correlate the need for surgery to be a similar act since the person is doing it to increase the comfort in their own skin. So why would someone feel this way? Why would someone be insecure about their own gender/sex? It is clear that men and women overlap in male and female qualities much like a Ven-Diagram. Having some more feminine traits or actions does not mean you are a female, it just means you do more than most men. I believe society deems people who deviate slightly from female or male norms as the gender they act. This is because many may not see that we all vary in many ways. Therefore, a person who feels judged by society either directly by their peers or by acknowledging the variations based off the norm for their current gender, are encouraged to be the gender they act as more than the norm for their gender typically do, even though variations are okay. 

I have come to this reasoning because trans people I have talked to in person (I have family who are transitioning) and they said amongst others that, ""since they do not fit in with the standard definition of \[their current gender\] that they are \[the opposite gender\]."" So it seems to be based off a feeling of inadequacy, failing to meet the societal standards of gender so they feel compelled to become the other gender as to internally feel *proud* of the gender they are seeking to become next. Or to be confident and secure as the example of the person who wants plastic surgery may feel after the operation. 

This leads me to address the suicide rate as a potential support for my reasoning. It is as high as 40% and we know part of this is because of family rejection/treatment. Also that with family support it is to decrease the rate quite a lot! (Just so you know my family is very supportive of my Aunt (was uncle). Now, could this suicide rate be attributed to the severe insecurity someone who wants to switch gender feels? My Aunt was very shy, stepped on, and insecure as a man. Very quiet, never spoke up for herself (as a man), and stayed inside most of time playing video games. She is still the same today besides her appearance and participation in more feminine activities although she still plays video games and stuff. I am not sure if this goes for all trans people of course, but in my Aunt's case, I think over the years she has been more and more *emasculated*. Society is quite harsh to people like my Aunt before the transition, she was not the typical male stereotype and plenty are not. Yet, I am considering the idea that she has accepted the deceiving idea that since she did not fit in the stereotypical male role she believes she is a societal failure and to correct this is to become a female which is gender society deems her more likely to be based off her current actions, and because she does not want to change her life to fit the typical male role. She has accepted that she is not masculine in the traditional sense. Yet I believe a man is by being who he is, not who society deems he is to be. The trans community is very aware of the societal standards more than the common person does and this includes myself too as I am unfamiliar with all the lingo regarding gender. Since the trans community is so aware, they may be more aware than the average person when they vary in the gender norms that commonly categorize a gender. Yet, they also acknowledge that gender is *fluid* yet put a heavy emphasis on the very gender roles that are typical for female/male actions. If gender is indeed fluid, why need to dress and have the parts of the opposite gender when you can do that while being the current sex? Gender does not denote anatomy or physiology since gender is a societal construct that takes away all biological claims. Therefore, moving to a culture that is more appealing to the persons preferred gender roles/standards would theoretically be more resolving than remaining in the same culture the person rejects. Yet, interestingly, the person who does not conform to the societies standards still acknowledges them more than most people who do not know as much about them. Perhaps is even the greats promoter of stereotypical gender roles since if there is a transgender option, that means that each gender does have definitive standards and roles which they do based off society. Also a point where doing one this is more feminine or masculine oriented which is intentionally or unintentionally acknowledged by trans/gender aware people. Since of course, we all vary in gender expression, A feminine man or a masculine woman would denote that a woman or man associates with the opposite gender than they typically would be. Yet this does not mean they have to dress or have surgery as some of the trans community do. A feminine man or masculine woman wouldn't need to take on all the associated roles or stereotypes of the gender they are more than their current sex is. Ronda Rousey (Woman MMA Champ) is an example of a masculine woman, she has many of the stereotypical masculine traits, yet still has stereotypical feminine traits too along with the biological foundation of a woman. It goes back to the Ven Diagram depiction of gender where we may associate a lot with the opposite gender, yet we still are the current gender to some extent. Sex, male or female which have a biological aspect contribute to some of the typical gender norms because biology is associated with, thought, desire, choice, hormones which influence all three and these three things contribute to societal gender roles to varying extent. This is why a person is not one or the other, but is at their root the current gender based off biology and they may take on/have societal traits of the opposite gender. I contribute evidence of this root gender theory based of biology by the fact that my Aunt always thinks like a man and cannot have the mind of a woman. Yet externally participates in the typical roles of a female be dress, makeup, etc. also physical changes from hormone supplements or surgery. Yet, at her core she is still the exact same person who looks different since she is only able to address the middle part of the Ven Diagram if you will. The external, the actions, vernacular, manner, and has some depth to being a female now, but since she cannot be a woman and tap into that biological edge, it will always be a disparity where a trans-woman will always be that, never a woman without the prefix *trans.* This leads me to ask why change all the external when the internal is quite the same. Has society and circumstance emasculated or for a woman defeminized them so much that the feeling of inadequacy of being their current gender leads them to pursue even surgery to potentially feel confident as who they believe they are truly to be. When surgery does not always make the person resolve the internal struggle. Also, it seems that societal norms are a tool for measuring whether one is trans or not based if they fit into the stereotypical roles or not. This is because gender is a societal norm and a person amongst the trans community is so aware of these norms that they acknowledge deviations as crucial determinants of true gender. So is it really a need to be the opposite gender, if so, why is transgender transitions associated with surgery which is associating with the woman anatomy yes, but wouldn't that be transsexual not just gender alone? My Aunt has told me she wants surgery to feel the way she feels on the inside, and that she is disgusted by having male parts and a hairy body. Now, to me this seems like a severe insecurity and possibly do to emasculation caused by her circumstances, other people, and self perception of societal roles/pressure on her life. It seems based on insecurity and a deceiving view of societal roles of gender. Not sure if this is for all trans people or my aunt alone but that is how I perceive it. Regardless, surgery and family support still leave the suicide rate incredibly high, a few times higher than everyday people. Could this be the inherent unhappiness a person who wants to transition is experiencing and finds out it is not the answer?

Perhaps transitioning is the solution, or maybe it is distracting us from the deeper issue at hand which is the person's extremely deep feelings of inadequacy and self resentment. Comfort, established by transitioning into who what they perceive society deems they of them to be which turns into who they believe they should be, ironically based off the stereotypical roles they say reject, yet exploit many stereotypical traits of the gender they are trying to adopt. Which I understand is to make them feel more of their desired gender. Yet, this comfort does not entail resolution. Transitioning is a never ending process, always on hormones, always trying to fit the desired gender, etc. Therefore, could a transgender person always feel inadequate when not only failing to met the desired gender roles/actions, but also when exhibiting previous gender roles/actions? Transgender people, like my aunt, have a huge disgust for the gender they were, and perhaps put the shortcomings they have or that they perceive society deems they have when comparing themselves to stereotypical gender roles, on the gender they were and use it as a vehicle to cast all the issues on and look forward to the new gender as a fresh start/solution. 

I cannot seem to justify transitioning besides a person's free will. If you feel the need to you are free to do that and I will not stop you at all. Not contending wether it is right or wrong, but it doesn't seem to offer any benefit. Does it make a person happier? I don't know, that is a very personal and specific thing, but the suicide rate is not encouraging. Also to add, if transitioning is about gender, that means one can only be one gender at a time since one has to *transition* from one gender to the next. Not bilaterally be one gender or the other at the same time. So as you may have noticed, gender is fluid in function, and also in meaning because in some cases it is definitive and sometimes it is all encompassing. A male can experience essentially everything a trans-woman can and I think this is closely seen with the drag community. Very close ties in terms of expression and some of the drag community may also be trans, yet I suppose drag is not enough for some. Which I justify by the theory that those who seek total surgery are on the more deep end of the feelings of inadequacy. The reason for this inadequacy is the reason I am trying to get here.

&amp;#x200B;

Why feel so insecure about current gender? 

Why base it off societal roles many don't even agree with? 

Why change sexual characteristics/organs if it is about changing gender which at its core is a societal construct? 

Why the high suicide rate that remains high even with family support and surgery? 

Why the need for acceptance in a society whose gender roles they don't subscribe to? 

&amp;#x200B;

This post is meant for discussion and to really think about this. The suicide rate is massive, perhaps transitioning isn't the best solution. 

I do not mean to dictate what one does with one's life or anything like that. I think there must be something deeper to being transgender than meets the eye.

2020-02-15 05:03:27,f44ty2,2,1,"A few days ago I had a horrible night's sleep from having my egg recently shattered (haven't come out yet) and trying to process it all. The next morning my wife left for a conference and I dropped my daughter off at school. I was feeling fairly dysphoric and had decided that I wanted to spend some of my alone time exploring how things felt, so I planned a shopping trip to pick up some things.  I put on a pair of frilly panties that she had gotten me as a joke a few years back and it felt great.  Then I looked in the mirror and it felt terrible. I just wanted to cry, I felt so awful about how I looked and couldn't stand the feel of my own skin. But, I finished getting dressed and went to the store.


My plan was to pick up some panties my size, deodorant and eye liner.  A video I had seen recommended the first two and I've always loved the idea of wearing eye makeup. By the time I got to the store I was almost shaking. I walked past the women's section and almost burst into tears.  I felt awful,like I was a fake, a creep, embarrassed, and hideous and wanting what I could never have. I couldn't bring myself to walk into it and look for anything.  I went to the makeup section, couldn't walk down the aisle, went to my car and drove home.  When I got home I stripped off everything, fell into bed and cried until I fell asleep.  God, everything felt so awful and hopeless. I didn’t know how to define dysphoria a week before and now it felt overwhelming. 

And then my alarm woke me from my nap to pick up my daughter and run some errands. The dysphoria had faded enough that I was able to make it through everything.

The next day I tried again, only without changing clothes and it was fine, almost like I was running an errand for someone else. 

Over the last few days I’ve played around with the things I picked up and it’s felt nice but not particularly strong one way or the other. And I’m not really feeling dysphoric any more. Like, not great but not bad either, just sorta grey and in the background. 

Is this sort of thing normal? Like having a massive dysphoric attack and then it fading away? Was I imagining it all and everything I thought I felt meaningless? Since I’m still very much trying to figure feelings out, could this be gender fluid? Or something?

I'm from a writers’ resources company called [Winning Writers](http://www.winningwriters.com/).     Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes     underrepresented in publishing,  including (but of course not limited    to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body    positive, and \[dis\]abled. I’m  posting here specifically because our    long term goal is to change the  composition of our entry pool to    include more entries featuring diverse  characters and themes. These    voices need to be heard, and we are  actively reaching out to find them.

We are currently looking for new talent in humor poetry, short fiction and essay:

[The Wergle Flomp Humor Poetry Contest](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/wergle-flomp-humor-poetry-contest-free) offers  a first prize of $1000, a second prize of $250, and ten    honorable  mentions of $100 each. Entrants are invited to submit humor    poetry on  any theme. The top twelve entries will be published online.    The  contest is international and the deadline is April 1. The contest is     free to enter.

The fee for the contest is $20.

We     started implementing a policy of reaching out specifically to groups     dedicated to connecting/celebrating underrepresented voices a couple   of   years ago, and I'm glad to say that we have seen our entry levels   from   these communities rise. We'll be continuing with this effort in   order  to  keep trying to get as many people into the national and    international  conversation on literature as we can.

2020-02-15 17:54:27,f4cwy4,7,1,"Does anyone else feel more dysphoric when they get their hair cut really short?

My hair was kind of long-ish before, wich I didn't mind. I like having longer hair, but it was getting a little out of hand and I don't want it to look too feminine either. So I got it cut today. I already find it difficult to go out and do things like that, plus I don't think I pass and I don't want the hairdresser to think I'm a girl who just wants a short haircut. Luckily it didn't come up and she cut it fine, but it still made me anxious.

Anyway, I've been back home for a couple of hours and I've seen myself in the mirror a few times. Technically, it looks fine and it feels okay, but I dunno... I just feel like I look more feminine than before. I think it's because my face is more exposed and thus all the parts I don't like about it. Also, I don't really think it fits my style or personality. I just don't look good with it T\^T and I look like a child.

Honestly if I could have long hair and pass I would do it. Maybe I should try a different hairstyle altogether. (If you have any suggestions, please share.)

So, I'll be waiting for it to grow out again and before then, perhaps a hat?

Oh, and another thing that bothers me: I'm afraid people will take me less seriously if I don't keep my hair shorter. That mainly has to do with my own insecurities. I'm still learning to do what makes me comfortable vs. what is expected of me. It's a process.

2020-02-16 03:53:48,f4l47l,0,1,"I am 23 years old and have always been sort of feminine, or at the very least have rejected traditional masculinity. I have never thought of myself as anything other than a boy. I remember having an extremely powerful thought about being a woman, being in the wrong body exactly one time. That was years ago and up until two days ago I haven't had such thoughts. 

I never had any issues with dysphoria, i don't think. I've always had body image issues, worried about my face, my body not being handsome or whatever but I never tied it to being too masculine or not feminine enough. I've kept my body slim and thin to the point that I'm underweight. Probably massively unhealthy. I had always remarked to myself that I had a body that a lot of women would want, ha.

&amp;#x200B;

But this past week, as I delved into the trans community I feel this longing, to be this way. I never even considered the idea that I might be trans, but when i confronted the issue for the first time in a serious way suddenly things started making sense. I was obsessed with appearing clean shaven, thin, feminine. I am a writer, I often express my feelings in stories and what not, and looking back at the things I wrote they all seem to be focused on the concepts of androgyny, of feminine men. I always just attributed this aspect of my nature to being gay, which i freely acknowledge. 

This idea of becoming a woman has been lodged in my mind and i can't seem to shake it. But it's literally only been a week that it has occupied my mind with such forcefulness as this. Two weeks ago  I was comfortable in my body. Now I'm not. It was my impression than trans people suffered a life long yearning to transition to whichever gender they felt they were, in spite of what they were assigned at birth as. It doesn't seem right that a sudden urge to present oneself as a woman at 23 with no prior compulsion to do so should appear out of the blue. 

&amp;#x200B;

But everytime i look at who i was, I see that I was obsessed with transexuality. Not in a way that's like a sexual attraction or a fetishization, just a burst of jealousy when i see transgender women fulfilling themselves. I focused my attention on music that had transgender themes (stuff like Lou Reed's Transformer album, that song ""Lady Godiva"" how Reed did a live album with a transgender woman which is such a beautiful rendition and the lyrics to that song \[""Candy Says""\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPPlfHGVPrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPPlfHGVPrQ)):  

 *Candy says I've come to hate my body*

  
*And all that it requires in this world*

  
*Candy says I'd like to know completely*

  
*What others so discretely talk about* 

&amp;#x200B;

I read a bunch of books that happened to have transgender characters (City of Night - John Rechy among many others) . I wrote essays for school on the topics of androgyny and how shakespearean plays in his time had male actors playing female roles. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel so absurd. I can't come out to my parents as trans. I can't afford corrective surgery, HRT,  I can't even afford a therapist to talk this through (healthcare in the US is fucked, I can barely afford the anxiety meds I'm on every month) . I've had issues with depression, drug addiction, psychosis. I'm a right mess. I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I don't know if what I'm feeling is real or just some phase. I get that ""it's just a phase"" is possibly a hurtful phrase to use on some who's feelings are invalidated by such a notion as that and I don't mean to suggest it's a commonplace thing.  There are people who are certain and I believe their convictions are 100 percent viable, earnest and true. Like people used to say homosexuality was a phase. I don't subscribe to that notion at all, regarding sexuality or gender preferences. 

I just don't know what to think anymore. This came out of nowhere. Some days I feel it more than others. Two days ago I was certain i was in the wrong body. Today I feel less compelled to think that. But who knows what tomorrow brings? I'm just sad lonely and depressed. And I don't know what to feel. I don't know what I am and it kills me inside to be some nebulous void. I'm drunk and high and I don't know what to feel anymore except to embrace the void. I mean if i were to adopt a female physical presence I don't think I would feel right being referred to as ""she/her"". I just don't know. I mean i understand now why people use the ""they/them"" pronouns. But is it bad of me to believe that if were to present as female I wouldn't be put off by people using ""he/him""? That makes me think this isn't a genuine feeling, that this is just fleeting. But I can't escape these thoughts. I just feel sort of illegitimate, like i don't really belong to the transgender community, that I'm just latching myself onto something that I admire, not out of a genuine pursuit to fulfill who i really am but just to be a part of somethng. But at the same time, I felt the same way when I realized i was gay. I tried to reason that it was a fetish thing, that it wasn't legit. Eternal recurrence I guess.

Going through another bout of self doubt so I did this questionnaire hoping to find answers...  
According to the test, you can compare your scores to that of a typical crossdresser () and trans person \[\] to see where you lie.

I scored:  


Identity 11 (12) \[7\]  


Feminization 5 (10) \[2\]

&amp;#x200B;

Arousal 3 (4) \[9\]

&amp;#x200B;

Gender role 2 (8) \[4\]  


The way I understand my results is that my identity is pretty much what I expected, trans.  
Feminization is between both reference points, makes sense since I just started hrt and only dressed up a few times.

When I got to her house her and her mother just surrounded me hugged me as I wept on their shoulders. Then we made blueberry muffins and dishes about life. Happy ending all around.

Hello everyone,  
I just turned 17, and I'm really anxious about transitioning. Not because I doubt that I'm trans, but because I'm struggling to get access to healthcare. I came out to my therapist over a year ago and came out to my parents in March of 2019. I still haven't been able to get a consultation for medically transition, and it stresses me out. I struggled with anorexia during puberty, so it delayed my development by quite a bit. My voice never fully changed, and I have very little androgenic hair.  
I've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria by 4 separate therapists and 1 psychologist, so I don't have any doubts that I'm trans. I just need to get access to blockers in order to prevent further changes.

I know about [inhousepharmacy.vu](https://inhousepharmacy.vu/) , but I'm really scared about getting caught. I busk for money, so I could afford to pay for spiro, but I don't know how payment would work. I have a bank account, but it's co-owned by my mother. She would probably see a transaction going on and ask me. Is there any way to go through PayPal, or route payments through someone else? I wouldn't feel comfortable wiring anything to someone I met online, I'm just talking about my close friends IRL.

I don't really know how to feel about the situation. Part of me wants to blame myself because ""If I came out before puberty, they would have an easier time seeing me as their daughter."" Or that I might have been taken more seriously if I came out earlier. I'm also upset with my parents for waiting 8 or 9 months to start seeking medical treatment. I feel like I could have had a smoother transition if they hadn't waited to get me on blockers (I can understand waiting to go on hormones).

It feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Like I have to either chose to be stuck in my worst nightmare or castrate myself with DIY HRT. Idk. I could really use some advice.

Thanks,

Wren

P.S. Here's a picture of me with light makeup on. I'd say I can just barely pass on most days, and pass well on others. Wearing bra inserts really helps with passing at a glance.

2020-02-19 20:20:02,f6gp8v,0,1,"How Coming Out Saved My Life:
A Discussion of Depression and Suicide

Hey, I wanted to share one of the hardest parts about being a trans individual and something around half of trans individuals, on either spectrum, experience. For me, what has been most therapeutic has been sharing these things online and thanks for all the support I’ve been given. But anyway, I want to talk about suicide and my personal struggle with it. This is the first time I am coming public with this, but in the past five years, I have made four attempts on my own life.

The first attempt was my sophomore year in High School. I was just returning to the school after a year off of being away at an advanced placement program. This year, nominally was a great year. I felt like I was at a good position at Coloma High School. I felt no shortage of friends, got good grades, and participated in several after-school activities. I felt like I meshed well within the Coloma environment. I often consider it my best year in High School. 

However, at this point, sixteen-year old me had weird feelings that I couldn’t understand. I walked up and down and constantly didn’t understand why I wasn’t particularly meshing better in male groups, but rather I was constantly around girls. I don’t know if there is an opposite term for a Tom-boy to refer to boys, but that’s kind of how it felt. It was more comfortable. So, I thought naturally at the time, well, I must be gay. 

So, I came out as a gay guy, and I was accepted within the community. However, something felt off. I won’t get into specifics but I knew that me being “gay” wasn’t the answer. I didn’t feel that way exactly. Later, I found out I was bi-sexual and still am, but that’s besides the point. I just could not make the identity connection between being gay and myself. It wasn’t who I was but I had already come out and I didn’t know what to do. So, during Spring Break, I had made the first attempt on my own life, failed, and just tried to continue with school.

Since I wanted to have a bit of a fresh start after the first incident, I transferred to Decatur Public Schools to be closer to my best friend of the time and to forget about what happened. After all, no one there knew me, so I thought I would just make a new name for myself.

Well, that just did not happen. I could not really connect with anyone and I’m pretty sure that was because of my background. See, Decatur was the first “rural” place that I lived, having been from Denver in the past. So, I didn’t necessarily connect with the lifestyles that were so common. I mean, I still connected with people, but I did not have the large friend group and ability to talk to everyone that I had in Coloma, I just did not mesh as well. 

So, throughout my junior year, I had strong feelings of uncomfortableness and lack of inclusion. I probably reeked of that to other people which did not help. I had no idea how to make friends here so I just stuck around with one particular friend group. 

Now this group that I was with, I did not mesh well at all. In the past, I had primarily inhabited girl dominated groups and to be around a group of guys was new, and we didn’t always mesh well, there were fights over our desires and interests. Out of the 7-8, I usually sat with, I was really only actually friends with two. 

Of course by Senior year, I was getting included a bit more. I certainly got the shit taken out of me on a daily basis by certain guys, but I still love them. However, I never got that same environment I wanted that I had over at Coloma. So, I took this emptiness to the job counter and began working at various fast food chains.

I have to be honest, at this point I was taken advantage by work which got me. I was insulted regularly because of my “flamboyance” and I had bosses that forced me to work unpaid overtime to which I didn’t know better. It had caused me a lot of distress on a regular basis. I had no standard identity and I got made fun of on the regular for just trying to figure myself: so on my way home on one day I tried to run into a tree and I missed, just totaling my car.

I then finished my senior year, and went off to College. I didn’t know who I was and tried to try new things. Humorously, for awhile I tried to convert to Judaism out of spite because a couple people in high school would call me, “dirty Jew” all the time. That ended up causing me too many problems and that’s a story for a different time. 

At College, I had made various friends and had even met a girl to which I spent the next two-and-a-half years with, which ended recently for reasons unrelated to my transition. I explored my sexuality like most college kids do, I rushed a fraternity, I partied, and went to my classes. It was a fun time, but something wasn’t right.

I would sit up at night talking to my partner and say to her, “I don’t feel right as a person.” Like as if I was never right. I think at this point, as my education grew, I knew I might be trans but I just hated that idea. I have to be honest, I even became transphobic in an effort to repress these feelings. I called it a, “mental illness.” Oh, how I wish I could take back the words I had said. I’m happy I never unleashed those words on a person who identified as the opposite sex, my comment were only passing in private. It doesn’t make it right, but at least I did not bully anyone just for their identity.

But during my freshman year, that lack of identity grew and grew. I didn’t feel like a person. I felt like I was going through the motions everyday. I had talked about my feelings and had even put stuff on my desk just in case I broke down, I had even tempted the idea by getting close. I broke down on my friends birthday for reasons I do not recall. I will never forgive myself for the timing and the pain I caused that day, but it had happened. I jumped off the Little Mackinaw Bridge at Grand Valley. I even made the news at the time, but I just told people that I had fell off doing something stupid. St. Patrick’s Day is always a hard date as a result.

Anyway, I pushed on but never got the help I desperately needed at the time. I went through days and even a year. I began removing myself from all other friends except my then partner. I became a loner like nothing else. My only forms of happiness came from the short dinners that I had with my partner at the time.

In short, I entered a period of my life to which I could not make myself happy. I had to rely on someone else for that, which is wrong. And, I apologize for anytime I put my emotional troubles upon them. I wish I could take it back. 

During my last semester, a mere four months ago, I had another breakdown. I don’t remember what it was over: possibly a combination of everything dealing with finances at the time, my identity, and a relationship that was failing because of my near-constant depression and those issues with identity. I tried again and gave up because of someone else’s plea, I’ll never forget their good grace.

Now, come to a few weeks ago, my struggles with identity were becoming worse. I knew I didn’t want to live like I was. I didn’t want to be who I was. Nothing was feeling right, and I knew I was not meant to be Corey, but I was something else.

So, I finally came out. And for once in my life, I didn’t feel depression. I felt free and no longer under shackles. While before I didn’t want to live like I was, I just didn’t know I still wanted to live: just as myself.

I am sorry for the pain I caused others during those four events. I am sorry for the pain I caused during my depression. I know I am going to have to spend a lot of time building new friend groups, but, those of you who still saw me during that time, thanks for guiding me towards the light: towards freedom.

I often consider it my best year in High School. \n\nHowever, at this point, sixteen-year old me had weird feelings that I couldn’t understand.

2020-02-20 01:46:09,f6lg6v,1,1,"Hey,

So I'm a 19 year old (currently) guy, and I have a feeling I might be actually a woman, or trans-feminine. 

I don't know how to explain exactly, but a few days ago a feeling came to me that something was just not quite right about my gender identity. It is something I had questioned before, especially when I was 14/15 but I pushed it aside because (a) I didn't want to be trans, and (b) I just assumed it was that I was a more effeminate gay than before. I am really trying to figure this out this time, but I want to be sure. 

I am not sure about this still, mostly because I don't seem to have the same experiences of others that I read about online. I can't remember feeling 'different' to other boys when I was younger that much (except for dressing up in girls clothes when I could), I didn't think about gender identity at all. And I wouldn't say any Dysphoria has effected me massively until the last few days when I began noticing things. It feels like it's not ""enough"" to justify it.

Also, I am torn because I think I make quite a cute gay twink, and I can't decide if I just think I pull the look off, or if I actually like myself like that? This is also because I am so used to myself as a guy, and I partly doubt myself being trans because I don't necessarily hate being referred to by he/him pronouns since I'm quite used to it ( but perhaps that would change if I were to transition).

It is something I had questioned before, especially when I was 14/15 but I pushed it aside because (a) I didn\'t want to be trans, and (b) I just assumed it was that I was a more effeminate gay than before. I am really trying to figure this out this time, but I want to be sure. \n\nI am not sure about this still, mostly because I don\'t seem to have the same experiences of others that I read about online. I can\'t remember feeling \'different\' to other boys when I was younger that much (except for dressing up in girls clothes when I could), I didn\'t think about gender identity at all. And I wouldn\'t say any Dysphoria has effected me massively until the last few days when I began noticing things. It feels like it\'s not ""enough"" to justify it.\n\nAlso, I am torn because I think I make quite a cute gay twink, and I can\'t decide if I just think I pull the look off, or if I actually like myself like that? This is also because I am so used to myself as a guy, and I partly doubt myself being trans because I don\'t necessarily hate being referred to by he/him pronouns since I\'m quite used to it ( but perhaps that would change if I were to transition).

We both came out within a few years of one another and have been transitioning for a while.

That year is significant for many reasons but notably here because they had broken up with their long term partner for that summer and we finally admitted to one another how much we are and have been attracted to one another. We went on a date but suffice it to say nothing happened and we've had a great friendship since.
HOWEVER. We have talked more and more about the multitude of ways we care about one another including sexual and romantic feelings. The problem comes with the fact that they're still in a committed monogamous relationship that I have been iffy on in the past but now honestly do my darndest to support. Thing is, they've explicitly stated they have romantic feelings for me and I sure as hell think about them a lot.

So my question is: How do I balance my feelings for them while A) Staying close with them, B) respecting that nothing's ever going to happen, despite us both having these intense feelings and finally C) Not let myself get emotionally manipulated?

I felt like a they rather than a part of the we.) We had a mandatory meeting after class between me, a staff member, the teacher, and him. He insisted that it wasn’t transphobic, and that it’s his free speech. I said it was rude, and was bordering into hate speech. The staff members said that how I responded to his initial comments and how we tried to talk about it during class was inappropriate, and that I wasn’t letting him have his opinion.

So, [u/plumagednine](https://www.reddit.com/u/plumagednine/), here it is: I'm trans. I know you think I'm a girl, but I'm not; I am very much a boy. I know this is probably surprising (at the least) but I had to tell you. I know you probably have questions, and I'm not really up for a conversation, so I'll try to answer some here.

\- How do I know? I've fantasized about being a boy ever since I can remember, but I've really known since the end of 6th grade or so. Since then, I've had to deal with this knowledge without being able to do much about it. I have this thing called gender dysphoria, where I hate my body because it's feminine and I hate that people see me as a girl. It's technically a little more complicated than that, and I haven't been formally diagnosed (though I'm like 98% sure I have it), but you get the gist.

\- What do you need to do about it? Not much, I just wanted you to understand what I'm going through. Don't tell anyone **(please, this is very important)**, unless I ask you or something, and don't try to call me he/him in front of anyone who doesn't know. I don't really have a name picked out, in case you were wondering idk. Also, I probably won't want to talk about it, so please don't bring it up. If you do, I'll call you gay for liking me in middle school.

\- Who else knows? Fin knows, E knew (though I'm not sure if she believes me anymore, and I couldn't care less tbh), and that's about it. My parents most definitely do not know, seeing as my dad is extremely transphobic and my mom would want to tell him.

\- Where can you find out more? I'd recommend watching Kalvin Garrah, Sam Collins, and Storm Ryan on youtube if you really care. Also browsing r/ftm might be helpful.

Anyway, that's it. Hopefully I didn't leave anything out. Idk if this will clear anything up for you or make you want to distance yourself, but you're my best friend and I feel like I've been keeping this from you for too long. This took a lot of courage, so I hope you read this and understand.

2020-02-21 23:18:28,f7jmwb,1,1,"Hello, I (18ftm) have been spiraling for a couple of days because I feel like I'm the only person who feels this way and I've gotten zero (0) answers from anywhere online.

I'll tell my back story in quick bullet points just to give you an idea before spiraling again, just in textual form this time. I apologise for the rant in advance. 


(cannot wait for more than one person to tell me I'm not trans at all and never have been and I'm delusional, in denial and irreparably mentally damaged) 

Acting/feeling like a boy:
First time I remember I was probably ~4, first day of Kindergarten, told everyone my name was Rafael because I liked it better than the one my parents gave me, went to the boys toilets and thought that my willy just hasn't grown like the other boys' yet, they agreed with me, we went on about our day
In school I always went to the boys' side when we were split up and the teacher always had to pull me to the other side, I didn't throw tantrums as I just thought girls needed more numbers for the game
First time I understood the concept of gender differences was in first or second grade (?) when a girl hit me and I refused to hit her back because boys don't hit girls, everybody was confused, including myself when they told me why they were confused 
Tantrums started when puberty did pretty much 

Sexual trauma:
~8 when it first happened at the hands of my older brother by 3 years, continued until I was 13 (?) and realised I could say no 

Family past:
Raised 80% by my grandmother, my mum suffers from mental illnesses which people never fully disclosed to me, she spent most of my life in the psych ward, my dad works abroad for a couple months then is home for a couple weeks before going back out again, it's been that way most of my life 

Physical past:
Always been a fatso kid, never gave a shit about it until kids started teasing me but even then I only wanted them to stop being mean, not necessarily to look different, nowadays I care for it because it's unhealthy to have a high BMI
I didn't mind having tits when it was just fat buildup but when b***st tissue started growing in I hated it and still do

Transness:
Realised it when I was 16 because it was the first time I ever heard of ftm being possible. I knew mtf was a thing but it never occurred to me that it could be reversed 


The rant:
Basically my being trans has nothing to do with my trauma or how I look / how other people perceive me, it's about how I feel inside and I feel like a man. Not manly, not masculine, not butch, _man_.

I know not a single person here will agree with me that trauma has nothing to do with it or that I'm even trans in the first place but I know how I feel. 

I don't care about being overweight because of how I look or what people think, I just don't want to die from a heart attack at 35 because my veins are clogged. If my chest didn't have b***st tissue in it I wouldn't bind because it's just moobs at that point. If you told me I could have a dick and balls but had to keep what I have, it's fine. Because I don't hate those bits because of the sexual trauma I want to dissociate from, I just don't feel like it should be there because dick and balls should be instead. My high voice doesn't bother me because it's feminine but because it's young. It's a young voice. And I'm not as young as I sound. 

When I look in the mirror I don't see a man with a beard that's 190cm tall and has muscles to die for. I just see me. The same me from three years ago or ten or fifteen. I'm just bigger, older and have shorter hair now. But inherently, nothing has changed about me except I've annoyingly grown tissue I have no use for and _didn't_ grow the organs that should have grown in before I left the womb. 

I feel sexually attracted to women, yes, but not in a lesbian way, I want to be able use _my_ organ to have sex. I want to be able impregnate someone. I don't care about what's down there because as far as I'm concerned, it's not there. Getting a vaginectomy and a total hysterectomy would just mean it wouldn't exist for other people either. 

I feel sexually attracted to men, yes, but I want to have male gay sex with them. Where two butts, two penises and zero v*****s are involved. Again, as far as I'm concerned that doesn't exist there so I'd only bottom a****y


Why I'm spiraling:
Nobody feels this way, or at least I haven't found it. All answers I found were either from:
1) ftms with past trauma saying everything is valid,
2) detransitioned ftms saying they regret thinking they were ever trans in the first place 
3) people who went through trauma and felt like they were trans but never transitioned saying that my experience must be like theirs and I shouldn't make a mistake 
4) nbs saying I must be nb because I don't mind looking fat 
Or 5) people without a medical degree telling me that confronting my brother about my trauma is the only thing in the world that will ever solve my problems 



Why I want to die rn:

Nobody has answers, I can't afford therapy, and the replies to this will focus on exactly the wrong things and will get me absolutely nowhere again.

I apologise for the rant in advance. \n\n\n(cannot wait for more than one person to tell me I'm not trans at all and never have been and I'm delusional, in denial and irreparably mentally damaged) \n\nActing/feeling like a boy:\nFirst time I remember I was probably ~4, first day of Kindergarten, told everyone my name was Rafael because I liked it better than the one my parents gave me, went to the boys toilets and thought that my willy just hasn't grown like the other boys' yet, they agreed with me, we went on about our day\nIn school I always went to the boys' side when we were split up and the teacher always had to pull me to the other side, I didn't throw tantrums as I just thought girls needed more numbers for the game\nFirst time I understood the concept of gender differences was in first or second grade (?) when a girl hit me and I refused to hit her back because boys don't hit girls, everybody was confused, including myself when they told me why they were confused \nTantrums started when puberty did pretty much \n\nSexual trauma:\n~8 when it first happened at the hands of my older brother by 3 years, continued until I was 13 (?) and realised I could say no \n\nFamily past:\nRaised 80% by my grandmother, my mum suffers from mental illnesses which people never fully disclosed to me, she spent most of my life in the psych ward, my dad works abroad for a couple months then is home for a couple weeks before going back out again, it's been that way most of my life \n\nPhysical past:\nAlways been a fatso kid, never gave a shit about it until kids started teasing me but even then I only wanted them to stop being mean, not necessarily to look different, nowadays I care for it because it's unhealthy to have a high BMI\nI didn't mind having tits when it was just fat buildup but when b***st tissue started growing in I hated it and still do\n\nTransness:\nRealised it when I was 16 because it was the first time I ever heard of ftm being possible. I knew mtf was a thing but it never occurred to me that it could be reversed \n\n\nThe rant:\nBasically my being trans has nothing to do with my trauma or how I look / how other people perceive me, it's about how I feel inside and I feel like a man. Not manly, not masculine, not butch, _man_.\n\nI know not a single person here will agree with me that trauma has nothing to do with it or that I'm even trans in the first place but I know how I feel. \n\nI don't care about being overweight because of how I look or what people think, I just don't want to die from a heart attack at 35 because my veins are clogged.

My best friend doesn’t. At all. She’s got nothing like a masculine energy if there is such a thing, and all of these leanings have appeared after a long life of sexual and sexuality related trauma. She  realized she liked women way late in life, after having sexually abusive relationships with men(so obviously never connecting with her physical body in a positive way- she wasn’t even having sex with people she was attracted to!). Her mother screamed and drilled into her head lesbians were disgusting horrible things to be. She’s had lifelong depression related to her parents horrible marriage. I know male hormones tend to level out your emotions and up your sex drive, both of which must feel incredibly affirming and pleasant for her which I understand!

I can’t help worrying she is transitioning for reasons that may be..ephemeral? Fixable in a different way? The depression- the body disconnect-the mom trauma (which she has already gone a long way towards fixing my going no contact).




People often have an internal experience that is just NOT consistent with reality, and don’t know it. Some People become doctors and then suddenly hate med school and slowly realize they’re just following theirs parents expectations not reflecting on their real desires. Some Schizophrenics hear their names in TV static and shout back, responding to only the symptom- not realizing/believing that medication can actually alleviate delusions because it is a misfiring in the brain, not a malicious omnipotent presence communicating through the TV. This is a *totally reasonable human thing* wherein often we cannot see the forest for the trees.

I hope this post is allowed here. I'm ftm, and I'm pretty sure my extreme dysphoria has caused some sort of body dysmorphia or BDD.

I think it only makes things worse that I'm also very dysphoric about my chest, my hips, and my butt. I'm dummy thicc by nature AND I HATE IT. If I could, a trans girl could have ALL my curves. Please tell me if booty and titty transplants are a thing.

""I'm a girl, I have a boyfriend and I've had a fair few long term ones over the years, but I dont feel like a woman. If I did it over I'd be a man. I'm tired of going for hypermasculine men to make me feel comfortable in my femininity, I'm tired of going for the exessively girly dress up and doing my makeup because when I look in the mirror without it, I feel masculine, and I'm unsure if it means anything that since 14 I have had many dreams in which i was a man, in a relationship with a woman, and it just felt right and I didnt want to wake up from it. And with my relationships with women, be it sexual or platonic, I tend to automatically feel like less like a woman in the ways I speak or act I guess - my voice goes deeper and i hold myself differently. I don't know if I was born in the wrong body, am just adding another crisis because of personal work/uni stresses, or if I just have warped views on my own gender identity according to societal norms. Coming from a deeply religious background, it took me years to come to terms with my sexuality and accept it wasnt a 'sin' to have same sex attraction, but as a result it does cause me difficulty getting my head around these issues since it took 17 years to fully reject my religion and the phobic views it held towards people who thought/felt this way - towards myself and others, I'm ashamed to say. It feels like I'm either trying to play the part of the perfect hetero girl with her partner, or I suppose the 'typical guy' when i interact with women, particularly ones i like, because I forget what I actually have between my legs.

Unfortunately, I somehow forgot about it, and moved on. If I had pursued it further, I’m positive I would have come to the realization that I was trans, as I did late 2019.

Two years later, I was laying in bed, thinking about how if my girlfriend ever left me and my relationship with my parents became worse, I’d ditch my life and move away and become a woman. I knew I’d be happier, but I didn’t want to uproot my life, and I didn’t think anyone would accept me. I didn’t even consider the possibility that I was trans though (*facepalm*). Again, I forgot and moved on.

It just sucks, because I was soooo close, but I didn’t figure it out.

I’m trying to get top surgery, and insurance won’t cover it. I’ve managed to accumulate about 10k USD in savings, which is what the clinics in my previous state (Colorado) were quoting me. I had been planning on going there, simply because I wouldn’t have to fly out of state and could crash with a friend during the recovery period to avoid hospital fees.

Thing is, I no longer live in Colorado. I’m in Alaska, and as far as I can tell, no one does gender confirmation surgeries anywhere here, because it’s. 
You know.
Alaska.

So, now that I’m going to have to go out of state no matter what I do, does anyone have suggestions for practitioners?

If I can’t find anything, I’m just going to get it done in Colorado next time I’m back there for a conference or something, but 10k (plus travel fees) will clean me out. I’m not in danger of starving/freezing due to lack of heating oil, but having a pad of savings to guard against unexpected events is helpful.

I know in some way I’ll enjoy life much more as a woman. I’ve missed out on so much by having the wrong body. I hate it when I think back on my life and feel like my childhood was a complete and total waste. It fills me with anger, regret, remorse. I wish I could do it all again, properly this time.

I feel so close and yet so far from where I want to be. After a year and a half of questioning. Looking back at my childhood I realized the signs were there. Idk if it’s a curse or a blessing that I only started questioning in my early 20s. I know that if I did know for sure as a child, my family would’ve done irreparable damage (all very conservative and some very religious).

But I’m still stuck with living with family.

I want to start hrt ASAP. I desperately need it. I can’t stand another moment of this testosterone fueled body. I hate it. I don’t want it.

TL:DR: Sex post op feels good! Tried different things and it’s good! AMA and I’ll answer about my sex weekend!

So, I posted about 2 weeks ago about calling my ex asking if he wanted to hookup. So we had a normal breakup and we were still cool with getting together casually.

So we hooked up everyday over the weekend. And I can say that post op sex feels good! We tried different positions and just did everything as an experiment. Fast, slow, going super deep, shallow. It all. And it was great. 

I did learn that using a pillow under my waist makes everything feel the best for some reason during missionary. Cowgirl is good but super awkward now. Doggy feels the best for me.

I found a fairly new app called artbreeder.
It's pretty wild, it is an AI  photo manipulator, it has a ton of manipulations including ethnicity.
Specifically for gender swap, here are some pointers:
- use portrait and select upload.
- you are uploading to their site and they process it, it can take 5, 10, 15 minutes, it does have a queue and tells you how many pics are ahead.of you.
- when your pic appears, click on it and you will see 3 items below the pic, click on ""edit genes""
- the slider you want is gender, down for the opposite of your gender and up for more of your gender.
- its better to use a desktop/laptop simply because the sliders are more precise and you can enter a number rather than slide. 
- the sliders go extreme pretty quickly, one thing that helps.is to turn down ""chaos"" one notch.
- for some weird reason I seemed to turn Asian quickly (I'm Irish) so I turned ""asian"" down a touch
- there is a makeup slider but that's it
- it's easy to get out of hand and create to radical a change

- you can mix photos, you can save pics then merge your pic with it and any other pic.

- children applies random variations of your pic of both genders, if you turn it a notch towards ""similar"" you can produce a close opposite sex variations of you.

- it's easy to get out of hand and yet you can generate rather realistic approximations of your opposite gender.",trans,Artbreeder an alternative to faceapp,1582620615.0,"{'created_utc': 1582595415, 'id': 'f92g8t', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I am not sure if this is the right sub, if it\'s not please let me know before you delete my post.\n\nI found a fairly new app called artbreeder.\nIt\'s pretty wild, it is an AI  photo manipulator, it has a ton of manipulations including ethnicity.\nSpecifically for gender swap, here are some pointers:\n- use portrait and select upload.\n- you are uploading to their site and they process it, it can take 5, 10, 15 minutes, it does have a queue and tells you how many pics are ahead.of you.\n- when your pic appears, click on it and you will see 3 items below the pic, click on ""edit genes""\n- the slider you want is gender, down for the opposite of your gender and up for more of your gender.\n- its better to use a desktop/laptop simply because the sliders are more precise and you can enter a number rather than slide. \n- the sliders go extreme pretty quickly, one thing that helps.is to turn down ""chaos"" one notch.\n- for some weird reason I seemed to turn Asian quickly (I\'m Irish) so I turned ""asian"" down a touch\n- there is a makeup slider but that\'s it\n- it\'s easy to get out of hand and create to radical a change\n\n- you can mix photos, you can save pics then merge your pic with it and any other pic.\n\n- children applies random variations of your pic of both genders, if you turn it a notch towards ""similar"" you can produce a close opposite sex variations of you.\n\n- it\'s easy to get out of hand and yet you can generate rather realistic approximations of your opposite gender.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Artbreeder an alternative to faceapp', 'created': 1582620615.0}"

2020-02-26 00:56:16,f9kqk4,3,1,"One of the things I'm really trying to do as I've turned to face the reality of me is do my best to describe (mostly to myself) my *actual experience* being gender incongruent. So often I read people comment about ""gender dysphoria"" (one of the main ""symptoms"" of being gender incongruent) without explaining exactly what they mean. At a support group in my city that I've attended a few times, people talk frequently about how something ""made them dysphoric."" Leaving aside the question of whether one should allow external events to control their mental state, I always want them to go deeper and explain what the actual experience was that made them make that statement. It's not that I don't believe that they were dysphoric. It's that dysphoria is both such an individualized experience and something that ties most all of us together in ways that we just *get* about one another that it feels important to be specific. But so often people don't explain what that actually means to them, what that actually *feels* like. In that spirit, I'd like to give it a shot!

What I want to talk about is what I primarily mean when I say I experience ""gender dysphoria"". Now, I'm learning almost daily about the myriad ways that I experience dysphoria that I haven't previously understood, but there's been *one experience* that has stayed constant for me since my first conscious recognition of the desire to be female when I was 13. The best word I can use to describe it is *grief*. I *grieve* that I am not female. Unlike regular grief (like one experiences upon the loss of a loved one), though, it's grief that *never heals*. It *never* gets better. Time actually only makes it *worse*.

I'll give you a specific example of a time when I usually feel it.... I'm sad to admit that looking at pictures of transitioning/transitioned trans women (or ""MTF spectrum people"" if you like that descriptor) very often triggers intense dysphoria for me. I'm sad that I'm not them. I'm sad that I was born just a little too early to have had a chance of doing this sooner (in my specific circumstances). I grieve for these things.

To be even more specific.... There's a trans YouTuber whom I absolutely adore and who is doing some amazing trans-related work (don't want to more specific as I don't want to reveal who it is) whom I find extremely attractive. Of course my attraction to her is complicated as I think attraction is for many of us. I want to know her. I want to be with her. I want to be her. When I watch her videos I feel so much sadness, grief, and longing that sometimes I have a difficult time appreciating both her and her work. As perhaps my fellow support group attendee would say. watching her videos makes me dysphoric. I feel it in the pit of my stomach. It's an existential ache that nothing else makes me feel. I'll admit that these are times when I think of suicide. The ache, the grief is so strong. And I  know that it will never go away. Those are the times when I would rather fade into oblivion.

The best word I can use to describe it is *grief*. I *grieve* that I am not female. Unlike regular grief (like one experiences upon the loss of a loved one), though, it\'s grief that *never heals*. It *never* gets better. Time actually only makes it *worse*.\n\nI\'ll give you a specific example of a time when I usually feel it.... I\'m sad to admit that looking at pictures of transitioning/transitioned trans women (or ""MTF spectrum people"" if you like that descriptor) very often triggers intense dysphoria for me. I\'m sad that I\'m not them. I\'m sad that I was born just a little too early to have had a chance of doing this sooner (in my specific circumstances). I grieve for these things.\n\nTo be even more specific.... There\'s a trans YouTuber whom I absolutely adore and who is doing some amazing trans-related work (don\'t want to more specific as I don\'t want to reveal who it is) whom I find extremely attractive. Of course my attraction to her is complicated as I think attraction is for many of us. I want to know her. I want to be with her. I want to be her. When I watch her videos I feel so much sadness, grief, and longing that sometimes I have a difficult time appreciating both her and her work. As perhaps my fellow support group attendee would say. watching her videos makes me dysphoric. I feel it in the pit of my stomach. It\'s an existential ache that nothing else makes me feel. I\'ll admit that these are times when I think of suicide. The ache, the grief is so strong. And I  know that it will never go away. Those are the times when I would rather fade into oblivion. That\'s what I mean when I say, ""I\'m gender dysphoric.""', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'What ""Gender Dysphoria"" Means To Me', 'created': 1582703776.0}"
2020-02-26 00:59:05,f9krzo,1,1,"I just need someone to talk to

I have been uncomfortable about my sexuality since my last relationship, went through a period of time where I had to deal with the fact I was molested a lot when I was younger. I grew up in a household where everything acceptable, we watched straight, gay, and lesbian porn since I was young, before I even started having sexual experiences. 

My first time question myself came around in 10th grade when a female said I talked and walked funny, but it didn’t last long because I quickly got some pussy and went on a sex spree for the next couple of years, until my ex. 

What made me question my sexuality was the fact that I never stopped my cousin from molesting me, and I have always been an independent child, my therapist said I was a victim and I shouldn’t steer in it but I can not clear my head of it. 

Also, I have an attraction to transgender women. I have found that recently it’s easier for me to cum to trans porn than to  cis women porn. 

This drove to try an experience sex with a trans woman, and I couldn’t obtain an erection to have sex with her, but I did from a hand job, while looking at her and playing with her dick. I was not turned off or disgusted about her dick, but I was not turned on, I only gained pleasure from giving her pleasure. 

This confused me more because even though I did not get an erection while being with her, I still watch trans women porn. 

I am certain I want to marry a cis woman but I do not understand my attraction to trans women. 

When it comes to men I find myself uncomfortable with them because I feel like they see that I am not a confident in who I am, and when it comes to gay men, I do not want them to hit on me, it grosses me out. But the fact I think like that makes hate my stance on it because I have friends who are gay and I feel like it’s hindering our friendship. I want to treat everyone as the normal people they are but I can’t keep from feeling about my self and my attractions and confusion.",trans,I need someone to talk to,1582703945.0,"{'created_utc': 1582678745, 'id': 'f9krzo', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I just need someone to talk to\n\nI have been uncomfortable about my sexuality since my last relationship, went through a period of time where I had to deal with the fact I was molested a lot when I was younger.

So, I've been trying to do good at this whole adulting thing. My credit is on the higher end of average, and I have never made a payment late. With my tax return, I'm wanting to pay my store card off (it's a Torrid card that I haven't used in some time, except the occasional dress for doing drag) and apply for a secured card that I can use to accrue better credit. 

(I swear, the trans-related stuff is coming.)

So I don't take two steps backward by not having anything to pay off in the interim, I went ahead and applied for the secured card. And I got denied right away. From what I understand, it's \*pretty easy\* to get a secured credit card, and I know people who have been approved for one with worse credit. I even made sure that my credit wasn't frozen with any of the three major credit bureaus. Nothin'. 

I'm wondering if this has something to do with my name change? I had my name changed more than two years ago (ID and SSC), but on my birth certificate it still says my dead name. Has anyone had any experiences like this? If so, what the heck did you do?

2020-02-27 07:32:24,fa8jt7,0,1,"Soo, I recently found out I was non-binary, and I definitely think this one instance of social/physical dysphoria I’ve experienced A TON this year really hit the nail on the wall for me that I was transgender. 

Basically, because I’m still in the closet, I obviously still present as a “girl” because of my hair and extremely small size and curves (which is bleh, I’m literally 4’7 and I hate it). However, it seems that every time a guy acts sorta in my face (I’m really referring to two dudes in some of my classes) almost as if he’s most certainly interested in me, I instantly feel disgusted and insecure. I hate the feeling of appearing feminine to other people, and the idea of my facade of femininity actually causing a guy  to be specifically interested in me makes me want to vomit. It’s such a horrible feeling, because it also reinforces the inevitable feeling of being a “girl” that I’ve wanted to run away from all my life, along with the physical self-hatred toward specific features of mine that make me female presenting. I hate how I feel this way, especially since those two dudes I’m referring to haven’t actually done anything wrong to me, but holy shit, whenever any of them make a suspicious action I seriously want to write the word tranny on my forehead or something to give them the idea that I’m not real. My feminine features are a lie, because it’s not me. I’m never going to be that way, because I never internally was that way. These occasional scenarios this school year have been a major outlet of my dysphoria, and it just plain sucks. We moved seats in Comp today and I was seated next to one of the guys who I’m certain is interested in me, and I know he means all well but if he makes any more gestures that shoves the fact that I’m a dainty “giRL” my dysphoria is going to overload.

2020-02-28 03:53:10,faoo71,0,1,"I know ""am I trans"" is probably a really common question on this subreddit, so thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this in it's entirety!

For context I am 16 (AFAB) and in high school; I am bisexual and overall pretty masculine (if I was only attracted to women I would probably be considered butch).

For the past three or so years, I have been extremely confused about whether or not I am trans. For about a year I thought I was nonbinary (although almost no one knew about this, other than two very close friends), but I eventually dropped the label for multiple reasons. I felt like it did not acurately describe me, and I also didn't like the idea of going through my life identifying as a gender that many don't respect or consider real. To clarify, there is absolutely nothing wrong with being nonbinary, but I am a very passive person and the idea of being criticized by strangers for how I identify terrifies me. 

After I stopped identifying as nonbinary, I don't know that I necessarily considered myself to be a girl. I sort of just stopped thinking about my gender identity entirely, as whenever I thought about it for too long it made me really stressed and upset. Without really thinking about it, I cut my hair, stopped wearing dresses and skirts, and gradually wore less and less makeup (all I do now is put on some light concealer and fill in my brows in a way that looks natural).

I only started thinking about my gender identity again because I learned that several members of a band I liked were trans. There was a definitive moment where I really started thinking about it, and I cried actual tears of joy when I realized I could be a boy; however, later that same day I recall feeling absolutely disgusted with myself and completely unsure how I felt. I'm still not sure if this was repressed dysphoria or me reacting to me being wrong.

The main reason I'm posting this is because someone who used to go to my school came out has trans male today, and he came out using an instagram post. His experience that he described was almost exactly the same as mine, to the point where it was uncanny. As you can imagine, this immediately sent me into another existential crisis, and now here I am.

Overall, I really don't understand how I feel. On one hand, I really wish I was born as a boy. On the other hand, I feel like I could still survive living as a girl. 

There are a lot of things I do that make it seem like I might be trans. I dress and act pretty much as masculine as I possibly can, and get weirdly happy when people mistake me for a boy. Female pronouns also feel weirdly derogatory when used to refer to me. I don't like my body at all and I kind of wish I was skinnier (even though I'm technically underweight) but that could just be body dysmorphia. I really don't like my birth name either.

 I guess overall I'm at least slightly uncomfortable most if not all of the time, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be? I really don't want to be trans, not because there's anything wrong with being trans, but because as I mentioned earlier I hate the idea of having to defend my own existance. I also really hate the idea of knowing that I'm in the wrong body and being unable to make any immediate changes (i.e. hormones) because I'm underage. Honestly at this point I should probably just go to therapy, but I'm having trouble setting that up without explicitly telling my mom how I feel.

Honestly at this point I should probably just go to therapy, but I\'m having trouble setting that up without explicitly telling my mom how I feel.\n\nThis ended up being really long and I know this probably isn\'t very interesting, so thanks very much to anyone who read it, whether you respond or not :) Any advice at all is greatly appreciated!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am I trans or just butch?', 'created': 1582887190.0}"

Started a new job Jan 6th. Great company, awesome benefits. I'm really good at the work I do. 

Today we had a social gathering. First one is mandatory for new hires so I didn't get a choice in going or not. I would likely have lost my job for not going. 

I struggle really bad with social anxiety. I handle small groups well. Any group size 5 or less, and it seems like I'm doing awesome. I can be funny and interesting to talk to in those more intimate group sizes. Anything past that 5 though and my anxiety starts creeping up as a direct relationship to group size. 

Half the company was there, like 150 people in a tiny area outside the main building of my company, one I don't work at. 

Part of these socials is where old hires introduce themselves to new hires. 

Sooooo it was the perfect quadfecta of unfamiliar environment, unfamiliar people, forced interaction, and large group size in a small area. My anxiety was through the roof. I was trying every coping mechanism I have to try and keep it together and I just couldn't. I ended up crying multiple times through-out the hour. 

But the worst of it is that I was rude to my boss's boss when she came to introduce herself to me. I was in the height of my anxiety at this point, in the hyper aware mode. I apologized that I didn't mean to be dismissive, I just have severe social anxiety. She said ok and walked away. I definitely offended her. I'm going to lose my great job over a single moment of uncontrollable anxiety.

I already feel like I'm on eggshells because of being trans in a rather unfriendly area. Nobody in the company has made it an issue of it but I still feel it's a point of contention. Like the director of hr is constantly misgendering me, and it feels personal but I'm also the type of person to never say anything about it. Nobody else there has ever misgendered me.

When I had my first period (11yrs old) I stopped everything, my life was crushed. I've wanted to die since then. It became worse every time they came back. I can't stand being a girl, I want to be male or nothing at all which I prefer more. Now I'm getting more and more aggressive, I tried to cut my self near the uterus and remove it on my own. I'm only beating myself, I stopped eating at first and next time I get them I will vomit if I eat something.
For my shitty breast I use bandages so tight, that I am barely able to breath, walk and sit. If I feel them just a bit or see them I raise my hand and beat the crap out of them. (Btw I use the pills for women without a pause (off label use) so I don't get my period but it doesn't always work).

I want to ask about what I can do. My parents might not allow me a transition, but there's another way in Germany. Next problem is that I don't know how long I will be able to survive, because it take a lot of time and I'm about to end it all.
Next question is what consequences will my actions (bandages) have. I personally do not have a problem with breast cancer but is there more?

I've hated being a 'girl' since I am able to think and told classmates when I was 7. When I had my first period (11yrs old) I stopped everything, my life was crushed. I've wanted to die since then. It became worse every time they came back. I can't stand being a girl, I want to be male or nothing at all which I prefer more. Now I'm getting more and more aggressive, I tried to cut my self near the uterus and remove it on my own. I'm only beating myself, I stopped eating at first and next time I get them I will vomit if I eat something.\nFor my shitty breast I use bandages so tight, that I am barely able to breath, walk and sit. If I feel them just a bit or see them I raise my hand and beat the crap out of them.

I just want some advice! My best friend has started dating a lovely trans woman (mtf) and I just want some advice on how to best make her feel welcome as a friend. Not sure if it matters but my friend is a straight male, I am a female that has just started to question where I am on the spectrum recently.

I would like to get to know her better and hang out, but I don’t want to make her (her preferred pronouns are she/hers) feel uncomfortable in any way.

I work at a tattoo shop that has a pretty significant LGBTQ+ clientele, so I have no issue or qualms with anyone at all, I do my best to respect preferred pronouns and I do my best to make sure EVERYONE is welcome. That being said, it’s definitely different being welcoming at work and being welcoming on a friend level.

Obviously I don’t plan on making any off color jokes or pry into her past, but I just don’t want to do anything that might be construed as a micro aggression? I hope that makes sense.
