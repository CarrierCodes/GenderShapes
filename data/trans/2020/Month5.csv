2020-05-01 13:48:51,gbiepc,0,1,"Hi all, 

This is my first time posting here, maybe a long spell, I just wanted to get some stuff off of my mind, its always been there, looming.  So it's obvious what I want to talk about if I am posting here. I was never really a normal child. To start with, I never was into sport, or wrestling or really boyish things, like I did go quad-bike riding with my father a lot but thats because it was us and I wanted to spend time with him, more about my father in a bit; yes daddy issues (Im not good at being male). but in saying that I was never overly feminine, or really expressed female interests as a kid, growing up at times I had no friends, all female friends, mostly male friends and then a lot of combinations in between. 

I was always self conscious about my body, always felt fat, even as a little kid, and nobody ever told me I was fat, my parents were decently nice people, they tried to convince me to get into sport but never forced me, I didn't like other kids, I got along with the adults, they were more interesting lol, I was a boomer of a kid lets put it that way.

In high school I was slowly stumbling into puberty and I just hated hair, all the hair it was dreadful, honest to god was jealous of guys who were delayed or had a really lite puberty. Also jealous of Thai guys yeah I'm the √ºber √®gg, my shell is made of unakite, I RATTLE IN THE NIGHT, forever rolling ( ). lol. So eventually I caught onto the fact that I like women and in latter years men, and you know what, I found out that I am just not that fussy. So when I got older I just thought, ""oh I am just really, really gay if I want to wear skirts and stockings and heels and paint my nails and wear a wig or \_\_\_\_\_NAME FEMININE THING\_\_\_\_\_, I am just sexually attracted to the idea of being turned into a woman, this is a fetish, I should keep it on the down low."" Thats what I told myself for a bit in my latter teenage years. So the bedroom was the only place I felt comfortable being this way, you know most men fantasise at some point in there lives about being a sissy, yeah totally, totally normal, nothing to see here. 

Now, I am in university and to be honest I just have days were I feel nervous around anyone and everyone, so the first time I ever told somebody about how I was, it was to a university councillor, we also talked about a bunch of stuff, like my extreme depression and anxiety, yeah, still have those, medication only really slices off the extremes of it, ""Evens me out"", haven't had to be on meds in a while but still have problems. So I had episodes where I wanted to be a girl, or I just found myself dwelling on it, I have never had dreams about being a woman,  just me being nervous male or some weird stuff, maybe I have and forgot.

So what do I do at university, I study Chemistry and Biology and in a way it feels amazing and exciting, I love it when my mind is blown, learning about the world on a deeper level is such a joy on a fundamental level. Yet, I'm learning about Biology, My lecturer once said if somebody could figure out how to successfully repress or express the genes that trigger male development you could have way more successful transitions in MtF and FtM people. [My Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmKKG6tCP3M) . But thats decades away, and I had for the first time to really sit down and mull over why I had that reaction.

The next one came when I had my second session of chemistry and had a new lab tutor ( the proper name escapes me at the moment), she was trans, yeah I was super nervous around her and I really hope she didn't take that the wrong way, but she was a honours student doing biochemistry, which is what I wanted to get into, and well, it was confronting, like wow, she was super nice, helped us out, made sure we didn't blow up anything and taught us new chemistry techniques. funny story one time I was asking her about LUMOs and HOMOs, yes these are actual chemistry things, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOMO\_and\_LUMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOMO_and_LUMO), she look at me with, what the fuck eyes until it clicked, oh that, and I was just standing there like, Ah don't kill me.

And ever since then its been a theme of my life, recently I have been playing a female D&amp;D character, thats the closest I ever got to coming out while reserving the ability to say ""no transo but"" too my friends. I don't know what to do, I have way too much time to myself now. My father is everything phobic, with the exception of black people, which always amazed me, yeah I don't know how that works. I recently changed my last name to my mothers maiden name, but I still love my dad, he just has issue, paranoia. Half my family isn't really the accepting type, the other half has a religious tinge, I can't predict how it will go down if I ever discussed it. The only family member I ever kind of talked to about it was my mum, because I think she picked up on it. 

Im 19, A uni student, I live at home, I'm stuck inside, I have exhausted all distortions and distractions, slowly I just get more melancholic, then maybe it will go away for a bit, but I'm terrified. If I ever came out, would I regret it, will this be a phase, what if I'm not pretty enough, Im tall, my shoulders are wide, I look to male, woman get screwed over all the time in this world, aren't I just screwing myself over, think of the Murder rate, a lot of my friends were Muslims at one point and they had some really conservative mindsets about jews, yikes what would happen if they found out. And I though surely, surely these are enough reasons to forget about this, but I just can't let it go, I started writing a diary were I wrote about myself as a woman, is that normal, I like my original name, I also call myself Esther sometimes, I like that name, oh god why do I like that name too. 

So thats where I am, TL;DR I'm confused and over thinking this and have sort of accepted that if I ever came out or transitioned, I would burn bridges, and it would fuck up my life. There I kind of feel a little better. Thank you if you read this, I wouldn't have ever expected anybody to get this far and not cringe at my spelling.

And I though surely, surely these are enough reasons to forget about this, but I just can\'t let it go, I started writing a diary were I wrote about myself as a woman, is that normal, I like my original name, I also call myself Esther sometimes, I like that name, oh god why do I like that name too. \n\nSo thats where I am, TL;DR I\'m confused and over thinking this and have sort of accepted that if I ever came out or transitioned, I would burn bridges, and it would fuck up my life. There I kind of feel a little better. Thank you if you read this, I wouldn\'t have ever expected anybody to get this far and not cringe at my spelling.\n\n[This is the only thing I do that I feel I can get away with, long nails, cut and filed, people poke me about it but hey its a thing, I know my skin is terrible, I moisturise, every day, a lot.](https://preview.redd.it/va4a0bm5p5w41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6fc639c0d67fb589a249a9a0eeb511366657ed)', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Feeling stuck and at the crossroads, and want to confess to the world.', 'created': 1588366131.0}"

2020-05-01 21:50:41,gbr7z7,0,1,"So, I started HRT in March. Right before all this stupid COVID-19 stuff hit. I'm pushing two months in now. I scheduled laser hair removal, and have had one session so far, at the end of February. Next one got cancelled, it was sometime in mid-April, IIRC. It got rescheduled for the second week of May. Today, it just got pushed back again, cause the governor of my state won't back down on disrupting things for as long as possible (not gonna say my state, but ironically one of the officials responsible for the closure measures is a trans woman). Yeah, I know I sound like a Republican there (eeh!) but I'm in an interesting predicament where I am starting to feminize, and my dysphoria is greatly increasing. I have to shave on an almost daily basis and it is ripping my face apart, and I still have awful shadow. I'm also out almost $2,000 at the moment over it. I also have to shave it as a guy, cause now there are bare splotches in it. It's a lose-lose. i wish the authorities in my state would stop being so obtuse with keeping things closed. Laser hair removal may not meet their criteria for ""life-sustaining"" but it is CRITICAL for my mental well being.

On a sorta related note, my HRT followup got cancelled, and I had to do it over skype. I wanted to try to push them to look into the Powers method a bit.  Anyway, my initial appointment was with a CRNP, rather than the Dr.   The followup was supposed to be with the Dr., but I couldn't make that work, so had to do the followup appointment with the CRNP instead, and she just repeats all the talking points. I'm not completely sure if she really knows much about HRT that she doesn't get from the doctor.

I'm trying to educate myself more on the matter, and I figured this might be a good place to start.

On paper, I'm in favour of our society transitioning to one without  concepts such as gender roles, as I view them to be ultimately detrimental. However, I'm also aware of the challenges that the trans community has faced to even get this much recognition and acceptance, and am worried that advocating for such a society would erode their accomplishments- after all, by abolishing gender, would we then not also be abolishing the concept of transgenderism? 

It's likely that I have some misunderstanding of either one or both of the topics  (I've only recently begun to research these sorts of things, and I've not taken a PoliSci course, so please excuse my ignorance, especially if I've unknowingly said something offensive).

I know that I'm not trans myself, but my brother is and I'd love to share something.

When my mom originally found out about my brother being trans, she insisted that she gave birth to a girl, not wanting to accept or believe it was true. For a while whenever he was brought up she would make a similar comment, until today that is. Whilst I was talking to my mom she asked to see him, however this time using the correct pronoun. I was and still am proud of her, though that's not where it ends. Later in the conversation she brought him up, wanting to ask about his old teddy bear, and this is when it happened. When she brought up the question my mom initially said ""she"", but immediately corrected herself, now saying he. Given how my mom first reacted to the situation I'm quite proud of her and the progress made.

I know that I'm not trans myself, but my brother is and I'd love to share something.

When my mom originally found out about my brother being trans, she insisted that she gave birth to a girl, not wanting to accept or believe it was true. For a while whenever he was brought up she would make a similar comment, until today that is. Whilst I was talking to my mom she asked to see him, however this time using the correct pronoun. I was and still am proud of her, though that's not where it ends. Later in the conversation she brought him up, wanting to ask about his old teddy bear, and this is when it happened. When she brought up the question my mom initially said ""she"", but immediately corrected herself, now saying he. Given how my mom first reacted to the situation I'm quite proud of her and the progress made.

I'm sorry if this isn't as big a deal as I'm making out of it, just wanted to share the good news. I wash y'all an amazing day

First, I go see my cousin who recently came out to me (and I to him) and that's really wonderful, I came out to my other cousin as well which went really well!

The issues happened when I came out to my sister (and more later), who never said a single word to me after that. Didn't even say anything in response to me coming out.

The reaction I got was the cold shoulder, like what the fuck, you're literally gay too. What kind of toxic bullshit is that

And whats even worse is getting disowned by my grandparents, I wore a sweatshirt that wasn't meant for [agab]"" and when I went to hug them to say hello (100% expected in my ""family"") I literally got pushed away. They couldn't even look at me.

So here, in one day I get disowned by 3 Family members and gain 2 strong allies. Please excuse me while I go fucking cry.

Knowing how similar my mother and sister are I now know that I will never in my lifetime ever come out (fully because she knows I cosplay as the opposite [agab]) to my mother or grandparents.

I'm going to cut all ties when I move out.

**disclaimer** *i realise not all religious people are like this*

Hey so I want to start out by saying I‚Äôm not trans , but I‚Äôve always been a supporter/ally and I currently have a trans girlfriend who I adore.

I recently posted on a bible subreddit asking for help for me and my trans girlfriend because she has Christian parents and therefore difficulty coming out to them. I merely asked for help and was greeted with ranging responses from death threats to people telling me I have an illness for having a trans girlfriend. One message however stuck with me particularly because it made me feel sick that people think like this.
It was in response to a comment I made about being loving , as I thought that was the point of Christianity.
‚ÄúHelping someone by telling them it's perfectly okay to ruin their body because of a mental issue is not loving. You might as well say assisting a friend with suicide is also loving. Or taking an alcoholic out for a drink. Or any other activity that helps a person be destructive to themselves because that's what they want to do.‚Äù  They are referring to being trans as a mental issue and likening it to alcoholism.

Would that not be the opposite in this case? Gender Dysphoria is a mental illness. For which a treatment is transitioning through HRT and surgeries 

A treatment for an alcoholic would be to seek rehab, not buying them a drink. Wouldn‚Äôt the equivalent to buying an alcoholic a drink actually be ignoring the issue and not seeking treatment via hormones and surgeries and changing the body?
Maybe some people here will disagree with me but that‚Äôs the way I see it. 
Anyway 
Thankyou to anyone who read this far , this has been a bit of a rant really.
I hope you are all well at this time in the world and you have my empathy and sympathy for how shit it must be for you to deal with people like this throughout your life.

Metoidioplasty and phalloplasty are two surgeries that ftm, trans masc, and non-binary people can get. I‚Äôve never heard of metoidioplasty before today and I‚Äôm not even sure I could even say it but I just wanted to share my findings and maybe get some opinions. Both are bottom surgeries that are used to increase the size of your penis, dick, etc. From what I understand, metoidioplasty doesn‚Äôt necessarily increase the size of your dick. The doctor will make it look more like a penis and the option of adding a pouch (?) for testicles or balls with can be added later which are silicone similar to other plastic surgery. You can have a piece of skin removed from the inside of your cheek to enlarge the urethra so that you have a better chance of standing to pee. Of course, this also depends on the size of your dick whether you‚Äôve gone on hrt or not. Meta is designed to give you a dick but a small one usually (not everyone wants a big dick but this is just so you know). Phalloplasty takes a graft from either your arm or thigh or sometimes your abdomen which is then used to create a longer penis because of that extra skin. Phallo also allows you to pee standing after surgery. I guess it just comes down to what you or your doctor think is best. I‚Äôm a long way from bottom surgery but I just thought I‚Äôd check it out and share what I‚Äôve found. If I‚Äôm wrong with either description, tell me and I‚Äôll change it. This is just my understanding and I‚Äôll link my resources too.

I‚Äôm 23, AMAB, and I just accepted that I‚Äôm a trans woman. It feels like a weight has just been lifted off my shoulders. I‚Äôve been seeing a gender therapist for 2 months now and she‚Äôs the best. We‚Äôve talked about a ton of things, and I‚Äôm transgender. And that‚Äôs okay. 

It‚Äôs going to be a long road, but I don‚Äôt want to waste anymore time and I want to be happy. 

I had a session today, and it was good. But tonight, my roommate had a girl over and her sister ended up coming over too, and I just found myself incredibly jealous. I wanted to wear the cute dress and sandals. I wanted to have cute painted nails. I wanted to be their friend and I wanted to be them. This isn‚Äôt something I can deny anymore. I‚Äôve been putting on too many masks for too long and it‚Äôs time to figure out who I am and how I can be the best version of myself. 

The dysphoria has gotten exponentially worse sense starting therapy, and that‚Äôs because the flood gates have opened. I‚Äôm accepting myself and starting to notice things. 

I no longer want to be a girl, I am a girl, I just want to be treated and accepted as a girl too. 

This is all so liberating and exciting.

So I've been planning on making a Patreon and wanted to make some desktop/mobile backgrounds as one of the benefits for paying supporters. I'm making a comic about my experience as a newly-realized trans person, so I thought it would make sense if I made trans-themed merchandise with it. However, I'm not really well-versed on intellectual property rights, and the last thing I want to do is to breech copyright. Or worse - accidentally make something that is highly offensive to the trans community. So here's a summary of what I'm trying to ask:

\- Is it okay for me to use LGBTQ+ designs (namely flags and symbols) for creating my own content?

\-If so, what should I look out for to make sure I don't accidentally use LGBTQ+ designs that can be seen as offensive?

\-Also, how should I credit the original creator of the design? Do I place their name in the description of the work or should I name them directly on the artwork itself?

\- Should I just omit placing my name on the work and just have the watermark instead?

I want to put my name somewhere so that I can claim that I was the one who did the artwork. This is an especially important practice for digital artists like me who are prone to online art theft, and while watermarking is a thing, I want to make it a habit to use as many anti-theft options as I can. I'm not claiming that I made the original flag and symbol design of course, but I know that not everyone will see it that way. Thanks!

I'm a non-binary trans fem about to start HRT and starting to record a project about my journey over the past few years with songs about the relationships, lingering religious ideology, and process of having to cut my parents out of my life for a while. Y'all know the drill :) I'd love to hear music some of y'all have made and maybe some stories about how your journey has expressed itself through your music, especially those of you who are undergoing HRT, since that can have a huge emotional impact. I go back and forth about my voice and how traditionally masculine it is (mostly sung growly folksy stuff with my smoker-ass factory worker vocals). I've spent a long time growing into and finding my voice and even though it can really give me dysphoria at times, it's become such an integral part of my music and identity as a performer. Even if I could voice train it up, I don't know if I'd even want to or not? Anyhow, I threw a link to one of the songs I recorded with previous band during my egg phase, and I can post the new project once it's done if any of y'all are interested.

Its a poem explaing how this battle in my mind between who i want to be and how the world is ripping me from her 



cant you see me screaming 

or the claw marks on the wall 

is it really only angels 

which have fallen down before 

to look me in my eyes 

expecting me to shine

is impossible as cutting 

the eternal thread of time



oh freedom taunt my life 

cut the shackles in my mind 

or the sounds of distant crys 

which shatter through my eyes

please dont tell me dearling 

why you walked out of my life 

for my clockwork hearts still ticking 

my blood just gently trickling 



so rise me up 

give me a single reason to not give up 

for to many breakups 

imaginary makeups 

for a mind like mine to 

experiment with shakeups



freedom taunt my life 

cut me from this pain 

please doctor tell me .. how do i explain 

after one long year you just drift away 

they'll soon forget your name

but even distant stars must align again 

its a endless game


one thousand tiny lies 

you ricochet around my mind

seeping in the tiny cracks 

you leave a stain like splattered paint 

till one true love makes it go away 



life is like a path which has no claim 

no direction or rejection bonded to your name 

it is what you make leap again 

out of the dark to the light once a again

2020-05-07 00:36:04,gewayq,2,1,"Major questions I have:
1.	Are my feelings valid about myself, my gender identity, and my doubts?
2.	Do you believe that what I am feeling is at the threshold that would warrant me transitioning? Or in a more blunt way: Do you think I am trans and just suppressing myself, or do you think I‚Äôm just a confused cis who is overlooking into things.

Hello everyone! So I have been incredibly conflicted about my gender identity for a long time now, and I cannot tell which thought or emotion I‚Äôm having is valid. I‚Äôm the type of person that will do what will make me happy, regardless of what other think, but I only act if I feel like I‚Äôve sorted out all of my doubts. So, I would love someone else‚Äôs opinion on the matter. Also, please excuse if I use any terms incorrectly, I‚Äôm really trying my best to use every term as appropriately and as accurately as possible!

So, my biggest concern is that I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm misinterpreting the true meaning of gender dysphoria, body dysphoria, and gender identity. I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm feeling dysphoria that is at an amount level ‚Äúx‚Äù and because I feel it at that amount level, I continually believe that I might have gender dysphoria, even though most people that have transitioned have said that they experience dysphoria at an amount level at ‚Äú10x‚Äù. My biggest difficulty is being able to determine if the amount of dysphoria I‚Äôm having is in the threshold of what a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù cis male would usually feel in his life, or if I definitely am the woman I feel that I am. 

I‚Äôll describe my emotions and thoughts on gender identity, and dysphoria as accurately as I can:
List of childhood:
‚Ä¢	For a long time, I never truly felt like I was any gender
‚Ä¢	I KNEW I was born male, everyone viewed me as a man, though I did not absolutely hate the notion of it, I always felt this emptiness with it
‚Ä¢	I never played with purely masculine or feminine toys as a kid, I always picked something gender neutral
‚Ä¢	I always played female characters in video games and I always felt more connected and comfortable with them, but I never knew why. 
‚Ä¢	I never wore my mom‚Äôs clothes or dressed in her heels like a lot of stories I‚Äôve heard from people who transitioned. 
‚Ä¢	I never felt like I belonged when hanging out with boys my age. 
o	I have always been really sensitive, affectionate, loving, which I was bullied for
o	I hated how boys would tease each other and be mean, I had always preferred connecting with someone, talking, creating a deep emotional bond.
o	Regardless of never fitting in, and being so out of place as a kid, gender identity wasn‚Äôt something I attributed that too, though I had never really felt the meaning of gender identity up until that point in my life, I always felt like a genderless ghost surrounded by gendered people.
‚Ä¢	In high school:
o	The way I viewed gender Identity and body dysphoria changed.
o	I‚Äôve always had body dysmorphia; I had never been able to look at myself in the mirror at that point and feel content.  
o	I lost a lot of weight at the beginning of high school, and became seemingly attractive. I felt better with myself that others found me attractive, but I never found myself attractive.
o	Even at my most attractive, I never thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy with the way I look‚Äù , or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm finally close or closer to the way I want to look‚Äù. 
o	I loved that I was losing weight and was getting a slim figure, but I disliked the look of having big muscles. 
o	Even when I did have a lot of muscles and a ripped figure, I was content only that I knew other viewed me as attractive and sexy, because I loved the attention, but I never viewed myself to be more attractive. 
o	Around the same time, I stopped talking to all my guy friends because they treated my awfully. 
o	For most of the four years in high school, I made a lot of friends, and almost all of them were women. 
o	Though I had always been a more sensitive, emotional guy, I didn‚Äôt think I was anything but cis because I didn‚Äôt think I matched the collective of noncis people that I had met up until that point. I‚Äôve always been super quiet, and in public I‚Äôve always been very direct and straight to the point‚Ä¶. Mainly I naturally presented myself as manly in public , but it never felt like me, but I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt stop presenting that way. 
o	I‚Äôve never been flamboyish, and I was never overly into gossip, or like the stereotypical Kardashian sort of vibe. 
‚Ä¢	Sexually until my freshman year of college:
o	I have always been attracted to women
o	I always loved kissing and foreplay revolving around her, and I never really minded not getting head at all. 
o	Intercourse has always felt weird to me. I have always struggled to stay hard while performing intercourse, but the thought of women when I was alone or doing foreplay/kissing would always make me so aroused. 
o	Sexual attraction to women has always felt like part jealous desire and part sexual desire

‚Ä¢	Freshman year of college:
o	First time I thought I was trans
ÔÇß	watching this gorgeous brunette woman kiss another woman, and I just felt right, I was feeling mentally and sexually comfortable and at inner peace with the image of me being that gorgeous brunette.
o	I tried Crossdressing to explore my femininity
ÔÇß	I bought a dress, heals, a wig, makeup, breast forms, panties, and a bra, and I dressed up
ÔÇß	While dressed up, I felt inner power, I felt a sort of contentment that I hadn‚Äôt felt before in my life. The thought of me living my life as a woman was pure ecstasy. 
ÔÇß	I felt sexy and gorgeous TAKING the pictures.
ÔÇß	When I looked at the pictures and saw my masculine features, I was disgusted with myself. 
o	I‚Äôve been crossdressing for 4 years, and I still feel that amazing feeling when I dress and I imagine my life as a woman, but I look in the mirror and see my masculine features and I get really sad and I lose hope and I start questioning if I really am trans. 
o	If I could fully look and feel like a woman I would take it in a heartbeat
o	I tried to sissy scene, but was put off by the notion of the sissies being masculine at all. I didn‚Äôt want to associate with them (in a Role model sense). 
o	I‚Äôve had my female name and identity consistent for four years.
ÔÇß	 Her name is Melissa, and she is this loving, warm, goofy woman, who can be strong, cold, and mean when she needs to be. But she is mostly quiet, and not over the top. 
ÔÇß	I‚Äôm afraid that maybe I‚Äôve just been fetishizing it because I always chicken out when I go to start the transition
o	I go through a constant cycle that last around 3 months and repeat:
ÔÇß	I get this incredibly strong urge to want to transition
ÔÇß	I do a lot of research on it, and I try almost schedule the appointments to start hormones
ÔÇß	I get afraid of all the negative consequences that come with coming out	
‚Ä¢	Changing the family dynamic and changing how my family views me forever
‚Ä¢	Losing career opportunities 
‚Ä¢	Not looking presentably cis for either gender for atleast a decent amount of time
‚Ä¢	The unknowns
ÔÇß	I set up a detailed plan to minimize those negatives
‚Ä¢	Such as working on my body, letting my hair grow, practicing my feminine voice before I transition
‚Ä¢	When I do transition, I would try and present as cis man for as long as I could, while I saved up money for the surgeries, and then I would get some of the major surgeries all around a similar time (don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible), like face feminization, breast implants, etc. 
ÔÇß	Finally, I get too scared because I feel like I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, and I feel don‚Äôt have any support group, so I surpress the emotions, and force myself into my work, until slowly but surely I go back to step one within a couple months. 
Sorry that was so long, but that‚Äôs all of it. Now after reading all of this, I want to know:
3.	Are my feelings valid about myself, my gender identity, and my doubts?
4.	Do you believe that what I am feeling is at the threshold that would warrant me transitioning? Or in a more blunt way: Do you think I am trans and just suppressing myself, or do you think I‚Äôm just a confused cis who is overlooking into things.

The thought of me living my life as a woman was pure ecstasy. \r\n\uf0a7\tI felt sexy and gorgeous TAKING the pictures.\r\n\uf0a7\tWhen I looked at the pictures and saw my masculine features, I was disgusted with myself. \r\no\tI‚Äôve been crossdressing for 4 years, and I still feel that amazing feeling when I dress and I imagine my life as a woman, but I look in the mirror and see my masculine features and I get really sad and I lose hope and I start questioning if I really am trans. \r\no\tIf I could fully look and feel like a woman I would take it in a heartbeat\r\no\tI tried to sissy scene, but was put off by the notion of the sissies being masculine at all. I didn‚Äôt want to associate with them (in a Role model sense). \r\no\tI‚Äôve had my female name and identity consistent for four years.\r\n\uf0a7\t Her name is Melissa, and she is this loving, warm, goofy woman, who can be strong, cold, and mean when she needs to be. But she is mostly quiet, and not over the top. \r\n\uf0a7\tI‚Äôm afraid that maybe I‚Äôve just been fetishizing it because I always chicken out when I go to start the transition\r\no\tI go through a constant cycle that last around 3 months and repeat:\r\n\uf0a7\tI get this incredibly strong urge to want to transition\r\n\uf0a7\tI do a lot of research on it, and I try almost schedule the appointments to start hormones\r\n\uf0a7\tI get afraid of all the negative consequences that come with coming out\t\r\n‚Ä¢\tChanging the family dynamic and changing how my family views me forever\r\n‚Ä¢\tLosing career opportunities \r\n‚Ä¢\tNot looking presentably cis for either gender for atleast a decent amount of time\r\n‚Ä¢\tThe unknowns\r\n\uf0a7\tI set up a detailed plan to minimize those negatives\r\n‚Ä¢\tSuch as working on my body, letting my hair grow, practicing my feminine voice before I transition\r\n‚Ä¢\tWhen I do transition, I would try and present as cis man for as long as I could, while I saved up money for the surgeries, and then I would get some of the major surgeries all around a similar time (don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible), like face feminization, breast implants, etc. \r\n\uf0a7\tFinally, I get too scared because I feel like I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, and I feel don‚Äôt have any support group, so I surpress the emotions, and force myself into my work, until slowly but surely I go back to step one within a couple months. \r\nSorry that was so long, but that‚Äôs all of it. Now after reading all of this, I want to know:\r\n3.\tAre my feelings valid about myself, my gender identity, and my doubts?\r\n4.\tDo you believe that what I am feeling is at the threshold that would warrant me transitioning? Or in a more blunt way: Do you think I am trans and just suppressing myself, or do you think I‚Äôm just a confused cis who is overlooking into things.\r\nI‚Äôd love any feedback.

2020-05-07 09:09:14,gf35e3,4,1,"Hey everyone! I have a little bit of a story to share today, hopefully it'll help some people and bring joy to the rest. Either way I have to tell it, so here goes.

I'm 26, and just celebrated my 2 week mark on HRT tonight. Most of my time on HRT has been really difficult, but the last few days have been amazing! But I digress, I'm sadly not here to talk about the good parts. No, today I'm going to discuss Spironolactone, and just how evil it was for me.

Now before we begin... Spiro works for a lot of people, and it is generally a very safe medication. I'm not here to bash on it for anyone else, or to tell anyone what they need to take. I'm no doctor, and won't pretend to be one.

So... When I started my HRT the doctor told me that Spiro would help move things along. He said that I didn't have to take it, but that I would see progress faster. I trusted him, and of course I took it. He wasn't wrong, but he missed a few details.

The most important detail is about what Spiro actually does in the body. It's a testosterone blocker, so that's obvious. It's also a low level blood thinner, and can have some pretty potent effects on sodium and potassium levels. That's why a lot of people crave salty food when they take it.

Either way I started taking it and felt okay about the decision. The side effects were rough at first, but somehow they started getting worse. Light headed, weak all the time, random heart rates throughout the day. The worst was how painful it was though. I honest to god don't understand how people can endure such a pain in the... jewels. And it was constant.

Well, I thought it was all totally normal. I kept saying I would see my doc in a couple weeks, it would start easing back as the medicine worked, it was only temporary, ECT.

Well... For 2 days I felt constantly weak and lightheaded, to the point where I simply couldn't function. I felt horrible, but I couldn't call out of work anymore, so I went anyway.

Welp, who would have guessed, but I ended up passing out at work. Que the ambulance, hospital, ECT. I spent 24 hours in the ER/Hospital, waiting around for doctors to tell me nothing. Turns out I was totally fine. Super weird and upsetting. Either way they finally let me go and passed my records to my doctor.

He took one look at it and asked if my heart rate was always so low. It was in a normal range for me, so I said yeah, that's normal. Well... Turns out taking a blood thinner is REALLY BAD for people with a naturally low heart rate. It didn't help either that the Spiro dehydrated me really bad. Cocktail of bad shit all at once.

So anyway, I guess that's my big and interesting story. Spiro is evil for me, and possibly for a fair number of other people. Now that I'm no longer taking it I feel great every day. One day soon I'll seek an alternate testosterone management method, but for today the estrogen is just doing its thing.

To leave things on a better note... The highlight of my week, every week, is the wonderful feeling I get from a fresh patch of estrogen. Every 3 days I change it, and every 3 days I can FEEL the fresh estrogen pumping into my system. Maybe it's just me who feels it, but nobody seems to tell you how strongly you feel it.

Only 3 more days till the next milestone, and that sweet reminder that everything is slowly getting better.",trans,A quick story about my first 2 weeks of HRT.,1588867754.0,"{'created_utc': 1588842554, 'id': 'gf35e3', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hey everyone! I have a little bit of a story to share today, hopefully it'll help some people and bring joy to the rest. Either way I have to tell it, so here goes.\n\nI'm 26, and just celebrated my 2 week mark on HRT tonight. Most of my time on HRT has been really difficult, but the last few days have been amazing! But I digress, I'm sadly not here to talk about the good parts. No, today I'm going to discuss Spironolactone, and just how evil it was for me.\n\nNow before we begin... Spiro works for a lot of people, and it is generally a very safe medication. I'm not here to bash on it for anyone else, or to tell anyone what they need to take. I'm no doctor, and won't pretend to be one.\n\nSo... When I started my HRT the doctor told me that Spiro would help move things along. He said that I didn't have to take it, but that I would see progress faster. I trusted him, and of course I took it. He wasn't wrong, but he missed a few details.\n\nThe most important detail is about what Spiro actually does in the body. It's a testosterone blocker, so that's obvious. It's also a low level blood thinner, and can have some pretty potent effects on sodium and potassium levels. That's why a lot of people crave salty food when they take it.\n\nEither way I started taking it and felt okay about the decision. The side effects were rough at first, but somehow they started getting worse. Light headed, weak all the time, random heart rates throughout the day. The worst was how painful it was though. I honest to god don't understand how people can endure such a pain in the... jewels. And it was constant.\n\nWell, I thought it was all totally normal. I kept saying I would see my doc in a couple weeks, it would start easing back as the medicine worked, it was only temporary, ECT.\n\nWell... For 2 days I felt constantly weak and lightheaded, to the point where I simply couldn't function. I felt horrible, but I couldn't call out of work anymore, so I went anyway.\n\nWelp, who would have guessed, but I ended up passing out at work. Que the ambulance, hospital, ECT. I spent 24 hours in the ER/Hospital, waiting around for doctors to tell me nothing. Turns out I was totally fine. Super weird and upsetting. Either way they finally let me go and passed my records to my doctor.\n\nHe took one look at it and asked if my heart rate was always so low. It was in a normal range for me, so I said yeah, that's normal. Well... Turns out taking a blood thinner is REALLY BAD for people with a naturally low heart rate. It didn't help either that the Spiro dehydrated me really bad. Cocktail of bad shit all at once.\n\nSo anyway, I guess that's my big and interesting story. Spiro is evil for me, and possibly for a fair number of other people. Now that I'm no longer taking it I feel great every day. One day soon I'll seek an alternate testosterone management method, but for today the estrogen is just doing its thing.\n\nTo leave things on a better note... The highlight of my week, every week, is the wonderful feeling I get from a fresh patch of estrogen. Every 3 days I change it, and every 3 days I can FEEL the fresh estrogen pumping into my system. Maybe it's just me who feels it, but nobody seems to tell you how strongly you feel it. It has a taste too, which is delightful.\n\nI would like to think every day will be wonderful, but it isn't always. Sometimes bad things will happen, and sometimes my resolve will be tested. I'll never be able to control that. What I can do is push forward every day, just like the rest of you, counting my success in triplicate.\n\nOnly 3 more days till the next milestone, and that sweet reminder that everything is slowly getting better."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'A quick story about my first 2 weeks of HRT.', 'created': 1588867754.0}"

2020-05-07 19:07:04,gfcxgr,7,2,"Hi all! Hope you're staying well out there.

About 4 months ago, I asked in a post about smoking and hrt, got some good answers, but I've thought more about it, because well, I think about my transition all the time:)  
Anyway, I have more questions!:P  


So, I'm on transdermal patches, and even though I've gotten some bewbs, and some thicker thighs, my face remains quite angular (to the point where it's not always read as female.)  
I know that aside from being unhealthy, smoking also is supposed to interact with hrt, and diminish the effects of feminization. **But what if my estrogen levels are at normal female levels?** Would I see on my blood tests that my levels are low, if smoking was fucking with my hormones, or is there something I'm missing?   


Also, there's **DIET**. I don't eat enough probably. Got real skinny and gaunt at around 22-23. I'm 28 now, and have had several periods of not eating, then binge eating, alternating forever.  


With smoking and eating too little, does it make sense that I'm not gaining the results I wanna see? (namely, a more rounded, or at least fuller facial appearance)  


Details on HOW smoking messes with feminization is highly sought after on my part, if the case is that this is something you can't really predict based on your e-levels.

Real life. I have severe ""WannaBeTouchedAndCaressed"" in a sexually intimate manner. It's bad enough that I've considered detransition so that T overpowers the E again. Pre-E my libido was pretty much nonexistent and when I did get the urge self maintenance worked just fine (now it doesn't and feels .. meh .. so I dont do it).

Along with this, my wife has no urge zero interest zilch. Add to that the fact that she is 100% straight and is revolted at the thought of being with another woman. To be clear, she doesn't care about same-same couples being intimate .. as long as she isn't one of them.

Cue in the other night when I was feeling it real intensely, ugh, head to toe shivers and goose bumps with belly twists and flops .. you get it, right? I go to bed early and curl up. My wife, thinking that I was upset at her about something came in, said sorry then started to turn to leave. I reached out, took her wrists (missed her hands) and pulled her in to hug. We do hug and snuggle and platonic stuff. 

Well, she read it in my eyes and body and who knows what else (she is a strong empath) and the repulsed look of fear came on her face .. I immediately let her go,. That was not my intent, I just wanted a hug from her.

Why ClitClap? That's where the weird dream comes in. I'm all worked up, stressed about no attention, so I dream about it.

The dream entails her making an exception for me except she puts on all kinds protective gear to avoid me accidentally touching certain areas. One, in the dream, was referred to as a ClitCap. To prevent any accidental rubbing of that spot.

There was more to it, that's all that I can remember. 

tldr:
Had a no-comtact sex dream where my wife wore a ClitCap to keep me from touching it.

UGH

What's a ClitCap look like? Damned if I know, I just know it's touch prevention.

We do hug and snuggle and platonic stuff. \n\nWell, she read it in my eyes and body and who knows what else (she is a strong empath) and the repulsed look of fear came on her face .. I immediately let her go,. That was not my intent, I just wanted a hug from her.\n\nWhy ClitClap? That\'s where the weird dream comes in. I\'m all worked up, stressed about no attention, so I dream about it.\n\nThe dream entails her making an exception for me except she puts on all kinds protective gear to avoid me accidentally touching certain areas. One, in the dream, was referred to as a ClitCap. To prevent any accidental rubbing of that spot.\n\nThere was more to it, that\'s all that I can remember. \n\ntldr:\nHad a no-comtact sex dream where my wife wore a ClitCap to keep me from touching it.\n\nUGH\n\nWhat\'s a ClitCap look like? Damned if I know, I just know it\'s touch prevention. \n\nDisclaimer:\nThis in no way means that I am open to chats or DMs offering to help out .. no thanks, not interested, keep it to yourself.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': '""ClitCap"" üò±', 'created': 1588919839.0}"

So. To the point.

I‚Äôm a woman and have always been quite happy to be so. I‚Äôve been deemed ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù before, by friends and family.

I do not think that a behavior can be deemed feminine or masculine, these are just social norms, whose history can be traced back but that can also be deconstructed. Men and women, I think, are equal, and I don‚Äôt think that there are feminine or masculine behaviors, qualities, etc.

That said, the only rational difference that I see between a man and a woman is a genetic one. (I recognize that they are treated differently, for example in terms of salary, liberty, etc, but consider that these differences are not rational and worth fighting against.)

Here's some background info. Starting when I was really little, I wanted to wear lipstick when I went out. I also liked wearing women's clothes from time to time. I also  remember lying in my bed at least twice wishing to wake up with female body parts. And look like one as well. I really wanted that.

Somewhere down the line I think I ran into negative feedback. I think someone said something that embarrassed me, or made me think that I shouldn't be girly. So all that behaviour stopped.

A few years later (and currently) I found myself wondering if I'm really trans. I'd spend hours researching people's stories, the process of gender reassignment, ect. At these times I'd really convince myself I'm trans. Something that really stands out is when I interact with girls. This has happened more lately. I'll get thoughts in my head like ""I wish I could look like/be you"", and other thoughts of jealousy. I really admire feminine aspects of life, and along with that just imagining myself being a girl and gossiping with my girl friends seems amazing. it can be really upsetting to me since that isn't my reality.

But something that always happened and continues to is all of a sudden my brain would tell me that it's not right. That I shouldn't be this way.

which have fallen down before 

to look me in my eyes 

expecting me to shine

is impossible as cutting 

the eternal thread of time

oh freedom taunt my life 

cut the shackles in my mind 

or the sounds of distant crys 

which shatter through my eyes

please dont tell me dearling 

why you walked out of my life 

for my clockwork hearts still ticking 

my blood just gently trickling 

&amp;#x200B;

so rise me up 

give me a single reason to not give up 

for to many breakups 

imaginary makeups 

for a mind like mine to 

experiment with shakeups

&amp;#x200B;

freedom taunt my life 

cut me from this pain 

please doctor tell me .. how do i explain 

after one long year you just drift away 

they'll soon forget your name

but even distant stars must align again 

its a endless game

&amp;#x200B;

one thousand tiny lies 

you ricochet around my mind

seeping in the tiny cracks 

you leave a stain like splattered paint 

till one true love makes it go away 

&amp;#x200B;

life is like a path which has no claim 

no direction or rejection bonded to your name 

it is what you make leap again

At this point I know I'm trans and probably a woman, although not experienced enough with female presentation to be sure of it yet. I came out to my mother today, as I realized I'm going to need her help in order to transition.

It is paradoxically scarier than I anticipated and less scary all at once. Luckily I have lots of support in all directions, so I won't have to go through this alone like so many others have to.

I am now looking at names, and mentally preparing for the lengthy odyssey, that is getting treatmeny in norway (high rejection rate, and years before actual help).

2020-05-10 04:59:21,ggv8gn,2,1,"A little over 2 years ago I started talking to a very masculine looking girl via Instagram. She told me she was trans but didn't want to come out of the closet and transition yet because she was scared of what her family might think. She said she would eventually. Fast forward to now, I have moved across the country to be with this girl and we have been living together for almost a year. I love everything about this relationship except the sexual side. I have dated a trans man before so I expected this to be similar. It's not. She doesn't have the masculine features I love in a man (body hair, muscles, etc.) I'm not sexually attracted to her. Yes, I thought she was very handsome when I saw her instagram pictures but that only goes so far.

2020-05-10 05:56:25,ggvy75,7,1,"I honestly get insulted whenever people claim to be trans without dysphoria. 

1. Being trans isn't a choice, people who are trans didn't choose to be this way and it's literally shitting on them whenever you do it because it's ""quirky"" and ""trendy"". 
2. Trans people suffer, glorifying being trans is the same thing as glorifying something like depression because it's not something that should be treated as a normal thing. (By that I mean acting like everyone should suddenly do it)
3. Actual clinically diagnosed trans people are always seen as bad people, because although dysphoria is backed by science people try to make it some fantasy. 
4. Sex isn't a choice and neither is gender. I will respect you for however you identify because everyone deserves to be treated with respect, and anything that isn't perceived as male or female IS a nonbinary gender, because it's going against the binary which are male and female.
5. When actual trans people get backed up with actual facts and science, people go against the science which makes it unfair from people who are actually suffering with this mental complexity. 
6. Why else would you want to transition if you aren't comfortable with the body you were born in? I suppose number three answers that. Unfortunately cis girls transition because they fantisize gay men (cough...yaoi).
7. The reason why so many detransitioners are around is because people transition without gender dysphoria, which makes actual trans people, look even worse, and that gives cis/het people against the community more reasons to ridicule the trans community.
8. Barely even, maybe less than 1 percent of the U.S identifies as the opposite sex/gender(in adults) so we are a minority and although it should be accepted it is not something that should be glorified. Nothing wrong with being proud of who you are and being positive about yourself, but it is not something that should be treated as just a regular every day thing, people shouldn't have to constantly switch binary genders. If you are genderfluid, it is not a gender, it is nonbinary because it is going against the male and female binary. Nonbinary is not a binary gender itself, but a gender expression, more of not identifying as either binary gender but somewhere in between. (Genderfluid people are still valid and deserve to be respected, though!)

She gave me 2 weeks to get out, I was still in high school when I became homeless for the second time in my life (we were all homeless for about a year when I was 10). I eventually found a burger job and roommates, but I had been couch surfing, sleeping in parks, and still going to high school (alternative school) before that while I was homeless. I graduated with a diploma, and I'm still really proud of that. I even went to community college and got about halfway through my AA immediately after high school.

But, I basically cut my whole family off for almost 5 years. Since then the only way they will welcome me into their homes is if I look, talk, and behave as a 'man'. So, because I just want to see them, even though all that and so, so much more happened to me (abuse, rape), I made the choice to perform this act for them so I could have some family in my life. 

These days there is literally nobody in my entire city it seems who doesn't know about my sexuality and transness, I used to be a total party animal and so I have a bit of a reputation still lol. But, that's just to say that my family knows all about me, I'm not in the closet, I'm not lying to or hiding from myself, my family just literally cannot process or accept homosexuality or 'alternative identities' as my mother put it. We have struck a balance, or really I have done all the sacrificing while they put up their barriers and rules and limits and bigotry and ignorance and I just had to and still have to deal with it....but for the sake of not angering myself, I try to think of it as a balance so I can feel good about seeing my family. I still have really limited contact, and extreme boundaries with them, they know and respect my boundaries of not bashing, preaching or insulting me about my past and present and identity and sexuality. I have made it abundantly clear that if I am to be their gay punching bag everytime I see them I will cut them out of my life so fucking fast it will make their heads spin and this time I won't give them second chances, not after what they have already put me through. So, tenuous is the word that describes that relationship best I think.

TL;DR:im very confused and i dont know if im just a masculine lesbian or a trans guy




Um hi. Uh never thought id like post on the trans subreddit or anything but im feeling pretty confused and have been feeling confused for a while now. Basically, i dont know if im trans(and i reay hope im not, no offense but this seems hard). Ok so firstly im a lesbian aaaand sometimes i feel like i want to have a dick, this confuses me tho cus ive heard lesbians say they want a dick not cus theyre trans but just because they want to fuck women, which is what ive always thought about when i think i wanna have a dick. Its like i wish it was there when im having sex and then boom gone. Secondly, i like my femenine features, i like having big boobs and a cooch, i dont mind them. But im always so against people seeing me in a femenine way like. I dont mind being called a woman, in fact i get a little defensive when my friend says im just like his guy friends and basicslly a dude.but i feel weird when im put in a ""femenine"" situation. I dont really know how to explain it. Ive also watched some str8 porn like a really long time ago (i tred to ignore the guy hah) but i always remember thinking ""i wish that was me"" referring to the guy. I have a lovely girlfriend and im always trying to be the more masculine one, its weird, i feel like those men that get super defensive of their masculinity even tho im a woman. I have always had an aversion to femenine things and just recently i allowed myself to start painting my nails black, which i hadnt before cus it seemed too ""femenine"".

Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I am planning on going stealth when I enter college next year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I am extremely excited and terrified about this idea. For context, I came out at 12, puberty blocker at 13, estrogen at 14, and GCS at 16. (Yes this is a very advanced timeline, and I was privileged enough to be in a very supportive family, and have been lucky enough to have the ability to effectively articulate and advocate for the steps I‚Äôve needed). I am not worried about passing, and I‚Äôve been completely stealth in social settings before, but 24/7 is a huge leap. To give some information (apologies for the vagueness), I was born and raised in NYC, and I went to a private all ‚Äúboys‚Äù school from K-8 (it was complete hell, especially at the end), transferred a private co-ed high school. Next year I am going to one of the ‚Äúsouthern ivies‚Äù with about 6 thousand undergrads. Dorms are doubles in either suite or single sex floor style. 

Anyways, I am reaching out to my favorite community on reddit to ask for help. Specifically, I want to come up with a super extensive list of every possible complication or awkward scenario I could end up in next year, and have some sort of plan or way to avoid those issues. The few I have thought of so far are: (lack of) a period, no baby photos, or anything prior to 8th grade, dilating (once a week). 

TL;DR Help me come up with an extensive list of what I need to do to seamlessly enter college in stealth mode.

Hello. I'm a cishet male ally. I'm working on a scifi novel that features a trans character and I'd like some input from the trans community on a part that I'm feeling conflicted on.

Essentially, its a scifi noir-style mystery in a futuristic world (think Star Trek meets Blade Runner). My character is an FtM¬†undercover policeman who is investigating what he thinks is a terrorist group when he's discovered and threatened with assault and rape.

Why is the scene necessary? Essentially the concept of this world is that its a positive spin on the post-apocalyptic genre. The world suffers a catastrophe but manages to overcome it and become a progressive haven. This scene is important because John (the name I'm going with so far) is a 30-ish trans man and this will be the first time he has felt unsafe or threatened because of his being trans. Its as foreign to him as being threatened for being lactose intolerant.

I HATE it in film, TV, or books when assault is just thrown in there to intensify things. Are there specific things I need to be careful of? Watch out for? Tropes that the trans community is sick to death of seeing and would love to see instead?

so, as a trans woman, i‚Äôm here for all enbys. totally get it, not an issue at all.

my confusion, however, arises from people who call themselves non-binary trans men/women.

my understanding of non-binary is that one doesn‚Äôt not identify strongly enough with one specific end of the spectrum to want the term man or woman applied to them. my understanding is that being enby is experiencing either the full extent of the spectrum at different points in time, being kind of in between the ends of the spectrum, experiencing the entirety of the spectrum all at the same time, or being nowhere on the spectrum at all (i know i‚Äôm kind of grouping two-spirit, agender, and genderfluid/genderqueer into the enby definition here but it‚Äôs my understanding these are forms of enbyism).

with all this said, if being enby is any what i‚Äôm currently understanding, why would someone say they are enby trans man/woman and not just say enby trans masc/femme? like, i feel there is a difference because for me, as a trans woman, i do have like masc qualities personality-wise as every human does (and god knows way too many fucking physical traits at the moment) but i don‚Äôt experience any sort of connection to that end of the spectrum at all. whereas, with someone who is enby trans femme, i‚Äôm assuming they would be more inclined to say they do experience more connection to the masc end of the spectrum then i physically ever do (e.g. they sometimes do embody the masc end of the spectrum as their gender identity).

so, with that said, can someone tell me where i‚Äôm misunderstanding? like, i don‚Äôt want to invalidate anybody (because it‚Äôs already hard enough to be trans regardless of if we‚Äôre enby, women, or men) but i genuinely can‚Äôt rap my head around my people say enby trans man/woman and not enby trans masc/femme as it really seems like identifying as a trans man or trans woman is inherently different from being enby...",trans,non-binary question,1589190827.0,"{'created_utc': 1589165627, 'id': 'ghfdz0', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'so, to start, i don‚Äôt want to offend anybody and this genuinely is me trying to understand because, thus far, i have not been able to understand.\n\nso, as a trans woman, i‚Äôm here for all enbys. totally get it, not an issue at all.\n\nmy confusion, however, arises from people who call themselves non-binary trans men/women.\n\nmy understanding of non-binary is that one doesn‚Äôt not identify strongly enough with one specific end of the spectrum to want the term man or woman applied to them. my understanding is that being enby is experiencing either the full extent of the spectrum at different points in time, being kind of in between the ends of the spectrum, experiencing the entirety of the spectrum all at the same time, or being nowhere on the spectrum at all (i know i‚Äôm kind of grouping two-spirit, agender, and genderfluid/genderqueer into the enby definition here but it‚Äôs my understanding these are forms of enbyism).\n\nwith all this said, if being enby is any what i‚Äôm currently understanding, why would someone say they are enby trans man/woman and not just say enby trans masc/femme? like, i feel there is a difference because for me, as a trans woman, i do have like masc qualities personality-wise as every human does (and god knows way too many fucking physical traits at the moment) but i don‚Äôt experience any sort of connection to that end of the spectrum at all. whereas, with someone who is enby trans femme, i‚Äôm assuming they would be more inclined to say they do experience more connection to the masc end of the spectrum then i physically ever do (e.g. they sometimes do embody the masc end of the spectrum as their gender identity).\n\nso, with that said, can someone tell me where i‚Äôm misunderstanding? like, i don‚Äôt want to invalidate anybody (because it‚Äôs already hard enough to be trans regardless of if we‚Äôre enby, women, or men) but i genuinely can‚Äôt rap my head around my people say enby trans man/woman and not enby trans masc/femme as it really seems like identifying as a trans man or trans woman is inherently different from being enby...', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'non-binary question', 'created': 1589190827.0}"

2020-05-11 14:59:20,ghp4hg,1,3,"hello, the trans people

ive been thinking about transitioning for four years now and the dysphoria is getting pretty unbearable. my main issue is that i'm tall. but like, very tall, full on 7 foot / 2 meter dysphoric mess of a person. i feel like unless i move to norway i'll never """"""""pass"""""""". i hate the term passing but i already get crazy long stares on the train for being tall, people stopping me on the street to comment on my height, and all that jazz, i just feel like if i was trans i'd like to just blend in with the crowd without people picking apart and judging my transness everyday for the rest of my life.

i guess people are still gonna be transphobic whether i look like a tall cryptid or a small woman, but i feel like i'd need constant emotional strength for trivial things like taking public transport or walking down the street.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One of the most tragic things in the world is when a parent ends up harming or destroying a child because it's ""for their own good"".

The ""concerned parent"" will tear into this ""*female impostor*"", this ""*parasitic lie""* that ""*infected"" their* poor little boy.

Ripping deeper, ever deeper to the core, tearing apart her defenses, every wall of internal strength and trust demolished, using a lifetime of knowledge, an absolute compendium of all their weak places, just to free their boy from this female *parasitic fraud*.

Destroying a bond of a lifetime, and their daughter's identity, and rupturing her to the core, slashing all the way through and rummaging through the wreckage of their own daughter to find a mythical son, that never existed.

Then they're surprised, completely and truly, that the child that they just symbolically disemboweled is gone from them, into the arms of a healer, or to lick their wounds alone, or tragically into death, but never fully back to them

2020-05-13 12:19:39,gixxld,0,1,"All of a sudden I've started to seriously think about my gender and I've come to the conclusion that whatever I am, I am definitely *not* cisgender. At the same time, I'm also confused and considering if maybe this is just a phase, that I'm actually a woman with serious internalised misogyny and a ton of teenage hormones but even that doesn't feel right.  

First of all, I have social communication disorder (SCD), so growing up I was not at all aware of how I was perceived by people around me or of what was generally expected from boys and girls. When I was a kid I didn't have experiences in which boys and girls were separated in class, or if that happened I never processed it as anything other than 'I look like a girl, I'm a girl', so while other trans people often use those scenarios as examples for them knowing they were not agab in childhood, I really don't have that. As a kid, I loved girly toys and girly clothes, and until recently really had no concern with wearing women's fashion, liking cute stationery, liking stuffed animals etc. While I know that gender expression does not equal gender identity, how can I seriously look at myself now, knowing my past, and say that I'm a man?

There are only a few instances that, were I trans, I could list as examples indicating that I'm not a woman, but in my opinion they're honestly pretty weak. For example, as a child, I used to feel a surge of pride and belonging whenever I played with the boys, or was involved in their games, and would subconsciously think of myself as one of them. As a child, I was also assertive, brash, blunt, and did not display many feminine personality traits (and still don't now), but was labelled as bossy. From ages 11-16, I desperately wanted to be perceived as more masculine than feminine socially, and even now I make comments such as like ""I know you wanted two girls but you got a boy anyway haha I'm so like a guy"" to my mother, almost wanting to prove how un-girl-like I am. I'd try and get people to see certain traits as evidence of me being more guy-like than girl-like. I struggled with accepting the more feminine aspects of myself because it always felt so uncomfortable to do so; at the time, I simply chalked it up to internalised misogyny, although looking back now it could very well have been me not wanting to affirm the gender that I'm perceived as. 

I don't know if this is indicative of anything, but, I've not once been jealous of another girl for how they look. I've been jealous of certain girls (keep in mind I go to an all girl's school) for being perceived as clever, intelligent and respected, yes, but never have I ever envied another girl's appearance. In fact, it's been the opposite. Subconsciously I would admire how guys looked, or I'd see a photo of a conventionally attractive male, and I just have this longing to look like that also. Ever since quarantine I haven't shaved or plucked my eyebrows and honestly, I feel so much more comfortable, and the thought of removing my hair makes me feel distressed, but only mildly, don't get me wrong. I only ever shaved because it was expected of me to, not because I have some desire to have smooth hairless legs and arms. I've always wanted to fit in and have an inferiority complex because of my negative childhood experiences, so sometimes I go out of my way to conform. But I've always felt different. And now I'm like fuck it, I'm not shaving, but I'm wondering what the reason for that is.

To focus again on what I wrote a bit earlier: while I'm very very uncomfortable validating my feminine traits as a woman, the moment I perceive myself as nonbinary or trans, that discomfort is gone. I feel confident to do what I want regardless of if whether or not it's coded as fem or masc by society. Additionally, all of a sudden I've gained this distress surrounding my body and my appearance. I look in the mirror and see a really pretty girl with feminine features and long beautiful hair, but it feels **wrong** and I can't pinpoint why. I'm very attractive, I don't feel ugly at all, but it doesn't feel right. These days I can't even cope unless I'm wearing a very tight bra on to put pressure on my chest, or if I'm wearing something loose enough not to feel my boobs. At night, I hide my body under my blanket to pretend it's not there. Most days I feel this deep anxiety which just Does Not Go Away, god I want it to, I feel like there's something I'm just not addressing.  I mentioned I have SCD, the fact is that emotionally I'm probably more like 13 than 16. Only now am I aware of how I'm perceived. I've lived in a bubble all my life. But it's been burst.

Now I just have these intrusive thoughts constantly: my inner voice now has a lower register, I'll catch myself referring to myself as a guy and I have to tell myself to cut it out because I'm not trans I'm not trans I'm not trans. I think of myself as Elijah and not the name I had previously. I thought I was nonbinary, and that I'm comfortable with a male name because of that, but it doesn't feel like the whole picture. While I used to be comfortable and happy wearing fem clothes before, now I just look at them, find the clothes beautiful, but no longer can imagine myself in them anymore and I don't know why. I long to wear clothes that look masculine and have a Pinterest page full of men's fashion, which I really want to own and wear. I tell myself on the daily that I'm not trans and that this is just a phase, which in all honesty it could be since I'm 16 and have the emotional and social maturity of a 13-year-old. I'm *praying* it's a phase, but I can't erase the fact that for some reason I'm hyper fixated on this. 

At the same time, **if** I were trans, I've effectively been socialised as a female. If I were to say I'm a man, no way would I be accepted as one by the male population because I haven't been socialised as one, although I may give myself too much credit in this regard because to this day I'm told that I'm too blunt and direct, and easy to irritate haha. Either way, this is all so so terrifying to consider. Whichever option I consider I don't like the outcome:

A) I pretend that this is all a phase and force myself to accept myself as female, all the while feeling anxious and depressed because it legit feels like I'm just repressing a huge part of who I am.

B) I cut short all my thoughts, try my best to get a hold of more masculine clothes, but ultimately tell myself I'm nonbinary in order to avoid confronting society and avoid significant social backlash and discrimination (not to say that nb people don't face discrimination! But it's definitely easier to go under the radar in my case) and chalk up all my irritating feelings of fear and confusion and of thinking I'm a guy to being gender fluid or confused.

C) I wait for a longer period of time and try to accept how I feel and understand myself better but at the risk of realising I'm trans, in which case I'm fucked because I have to present as female for the next two years at school and I'm terrified of dealing with society. 

I have this fantasy, where I imagine myself as a guy. I have a low pony and a fringe but masculine facial features. I wear guy clothes and have a flat chest. I like whatever the hell I like, my room is decorated with trinkets and floral wallpaper and I have a collection of cute Asian stationery which I proudly use, and I have multiple stuffed animals which I love and adore. I play videogames and I look like the protagonists I strongly admired and obsessed over growing up. I would be ok with this. That fantasy feels like me. I **want** it to be me. But it isn't, and I'm not trans. I don't feel dysphoria. Other trans people suffer so much more than me to be able to say they're trans, yet I've lived happily as a woman until these last few weeks. I'm not trans, but I'm so jealous of those confident in their trans identity who have had the bravery to transition and god I kind of want that to be me. 

But I'm not trans. I'm deluded. And I'm hormonal and a teenager.

Whichever option I consider I don\'t like the outcome:\n\nA) I pretend that this is all a phase and force myself to accept myself as female, all the while feeling anxious and depressed because it legit feels like I\'m just repressing a huge part of who I am.\n\nB) I cut short all my thoughts, try my best to get a hold of more masculine clothes, but ultimately tell myself I\'m nonbinary in order to avoid confronting society and avoid significant social backlash and discrimination (not to say that nb people don\'t face discrimination! But it\'s definitely easier to go under the radar in my case) and chalk up all my irritating feelings of fear and confusion and of thinking I\'m a guy to being gender fluid or confused.\n\nC) I wait for a longer period of time and try to accept how I feel and understand myself better but at the risk of realising I\'m trans, in which case I\'m fucked because I have to present as female for the next two years at school and I\'m terrified of dealing with society. \n\nI have this fantasy, where I imagine myself as a guy. I have a low pony and a fringe but masculine facial features. I wear guy clothes and have a flat chest. I like whatever the hell I like, my room is decorated with trinkets and floral wallpaper and I have a collection of cute Asian stationery which I proudly use, and I have multiple stuffed animals which I love and adore. I play videogames and I look like the protagonists I strongly admired and obsessed over growing up. I would be ok with this. That fantasy feels like me. I **want** it to be me. But it isn\'t, and I\'m not trans. I don\'t feel dysphoria. Other trans people suffer so much more than me to be able to say they\'re trans, yet I\'ve lived happily as a woman until these last few weeks. I\'m not trans, but I\'m so jealous of those confident in their trans identity who have had the bravery to transition and god I kind of want that to be me. \n\nBut I\'m not trans. I\'m deluded. And I\'m hormonal and a teenager. \n\nSomeone help? :""-)', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I don't know if I'm FTM or if this is a phase and I'm so confused"", 'created': 1589397579.0}"

My younger sibling was born female. Growing up she always asked female was interested in feminine things. She never really ever talk discussed or expressed that she was anything other than well a girl. However she has always been in her own words ‚Äòchawky‚Äô.  Looks wise she has always had very board shoulders and growing up around puberty she started to gain a lot of weight. She stopped wearing traditional female clothing though she still wears dress now and then. She cut her hair really short and started going by a gender neutral name. She kept gaining more weight and lost most of the traditional ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô features she had. Around then she started telling me that she felt like she wasn‚Äôt a female. She started telling me having breast felt wrong and she just wasn‚Äôt interest in having any feminine qualities. She even said that sometimes it feels wrong to be compared or described as remotely feminine. I tried to under stand this thing that maybe she was Agender or gender fluid. But lately she has been comparing herself to a boy claiming to have male habits and i over heard her recently talking about sexuality and gender. When penises came up she said she ‚Äòthings they are gross‚Äô continuing to say she doesn‚Äôt really want one, the only reason she wants to get one is because she is suppose to have one. 

I get really confused because i want to support her, but i feel like she is lying to herself. I always thought transgender traits presented themselves in early childhood. But It has only been since she turned about 14 or so that she started to make these changes. I think she is just trying to compensate for the fact that she doesn‚Äôt look like a woman by trying to be a male, or is combining the fact that she has a masculine astatic and doesn‚Äôt feel a pull towards being female and jumping to the wrong conclusion. How can i help her and be supportive?

I'm stuck in quarantine with conservative parents. I can't come out to them because it will pretty much guarantee a bad reaction. But this makes everything so much harder. Not being able to do anything gender affirming has been agonising. Makes me want to swallow a bottle of pills and not have to look back. 

So it leaves me in this mental state where I really can't be bothered to do anything that is necessary for me. Like homework, or exercise, and even socialising. I'm just filled with a sense of dread and apathy. I'm behind on 3 weeks worth of homework and 4 different projects with 5 days left until the end of the school year. I haven't exercised at all since quarantine has started and I have put on a lot of weight. I have cut off almost everyone I know, not as if they texted me anyway. I've only actively texted with my sister who I'm ou to but I feel really obnoxious and self centered doing so. I'm kind of sick of it all. I just wish all of this would end. What's even the point of going through all this if it will just deteriorate my mental health even further and leave me in a state worse than when it first began. 

Going through each day is just painful. I try to avoid looking in the mirror as to not see the growing and increasingly worse and more noticeable changes happening to my body. My body is bad enough as is but the fact that it'll only get worse from here hurts me. I can't do anything about it for the next three fucking years. Three more years of this is too much for me too handle. Even worse when my parents constantly keep telling me how proud they are of me being so manly. I feel so bloody dissociated and disoriented from everything at this point. 

I'm wasting every passing day doing absolute jack shit. Nothing exciting has happened in the last month. And I'm stuck in a loop of wake up, eat, YouTube, reddit, games, and sleep. The cycle repeats itself every day. Atleast until my inevitable demise. I can't even fucking sleep though. The night slams me like a wall of bricks as I realise how far gone I am and what my life is now reduced to. I get so emotional at night with no proper outlet as my parents usually take my phone or any technology away before bed. So I just go through this awful mish mash of difficult to articulate emotions all at once and it brings me to the verge of tears. But I can't cry. Even as much as I wish I could. I just lie there wishing I was dead. Wishing I didn't exist in the first place. Then fall asleep and let the cycle begin all over again. The only difference being that it only gets worse after each previous night.

I don't know why I'm writing this. I'm terrified of even posting this. I always feel so uncomfortable in trans spaces because of my sense of not belonging in them. The few times I commented I needed actual willpower to do so. I just feel like I'm being a burden and that I should just shut up and keep it all in like I always do. But alas here I am at almost 3AM in the fucking morning not knowing what the fuck I'm doing, probably going to regret this and throw it into the bad choices pile among the rest of the things that shape up my fucking waste of a life. 

Anyway I'll try and fall asleep.

I'm 27 male (live so far as cis). I've been curious for several years about feminine life, first time I crossdressed I had 12. For the last 15 years I switch constantly between thinking I'm trans and that all I have is a fetish. For all these years pretty much every time I masturbated, I was saw me as the woman. I don't know what the fuck is going on, I have erections while trying women clothing and that makes me feel awful. To the point that I've gotten into chastity, but then again I get torn between the fetish and trans ideas.

I used to walk in front of a wedding dressing shop everyday to get to work and it made depressed to look at it half the time.

At the same time I don't particularly feel attracted to males, just to cocks I guess. And this makes me think even more that perhaps I just like to dress as a woman and be submissive.

I'm really lost, I don't feel like talking with anyone I know in person as it would bring a lot do deal with.

My best friend is a woman, she said numerous times she does not think I'm a cis male. Once she asked me to try one of her high heels (we have about the same sizing), I went from pure joy and excitement to dread as I realized I would have to fight an erection. Is that normal?

I have a reoccurring dream where I'm living in the body of a female friend of mine, there is nothing sexual about it, just a nice dream overall.

I'm sorry for throwing all this here, my mind is a mess right now and I just kinda wrote as I thought. All the time I think I should try to transition, but the next second I think it's too late for me or that it's just a fetish I have.

To the point that I've gotten into chastity, but then again I get torn between the fetish and trans ideas.\n\nI used to walk in front of a wedding dressing shop everyday to get to work and it made depressed to look at it half the time.\n\nAt the same time I don't particularly feel attracted to males, just to cocks I guess. And this makes me think even more that perhaps I just like to dress as a woman and be submissive.\n\nI'm really lost, I don't feel like talking with anyone I know in person as it would bring a lot do deal with.\n\nMy best friend is a woman, she said numerous times she does not think I'm a cis male. Once she asked me to try one of her high heels (we have about the same sizing), I went from pure joy and excitement to dread as I realized I would have to fight an erection. Is that normal?\n\nI have a reoccurring dream where I'm living in the body of a female friend of mine, there is nothing sexual about it, just a nice dream overall.\n\nI'm sorry for throwing all this here, my mind is a mess right now and I just kinda wrote as I thought. All the time I think I should try to transition, but the next second I think it's too late for me or that it's just a fetish I have.\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so there is that."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am I trans?', 'created': 1589453446.0}"

&amp;#x200B;

I've never heard this argument about why being trans is more common now than prior generations. They said it is more common now due to more petro-chemicals consumed by most of humanity since WWII in the womb and during development, which in isolation, is fairly undisputed.  


But does it have any bearing on gender issues?  


Is there any science to back this argument? Or are more people out now because it is more acceptable to be out now than in, say, the early-1900s? Is there any documentation about trans prevalence over time?

Below is the comment. Thoughts? Based in *actual* science? Transphobic science? Simply misinformed about the subject matter? The comment could be worded more neutrally, but it also doesn't attempt to attack either. I've never heard of this.

After that I want to High School, I wore a skirt for my entire first year there because every girl did and I didn't want to feel different from others but I did not like it.

2. What if they won't accept me as who I identify as? What if they will think it's just a phase?

I do not think it is said enough, the true overall frustration that is dating as a transgender individual. This isn‚Äôt being written for pity, or as a complaint, but more as a sober, clear-headed view over the matter. In being transgender, or non-binary, or androgynous, or whatever strikes your fancy to call it, it takes a special kind of trust and release in order to form a lasting relationship with someone who is *not* transgender. Unfortunately, in my personal experience, motivations are either hidden until a goal is achieved for personal gain on the other party‚Äôs behalf, or they are attracted to transgender individuals for all the wrong reasons. I would like to make my overall point mid way through this testimony- my mental illness (gender dysphoria) that I treat through my transition, is my release, and a way for me to feel more comfortable in my own skin. It can shift, and vary, day to day, week by week, but it will never, ever, be there to be someone‚Äôs fetish. **My mental struggles, nobody‚Äôs mental struggles, should ever be anyone‚Äôs fetish.** Albeit that is my personal opinion, I believe it is a fair one. In my own experience, I find the paradox as follows: straight women believe dating me makes them lesbian, straight men believe dating me makes them gay, and both parties are typically ashamed to be in public with me. Gay men typically are not attracted to my genitalia, or they fetishize it to the point that it is all they see. And lesbian women typically believe that dating me makes them straight, or like gay men, they are more attracted to the genitalia than the person attached to it. It‚Äôs quite a pickle, and I definitely do not believe my thoughts are my thoughts alone- I would love to hear from other trans-identifying individuals. I would have to say, most messages I receive are in regards to someone finding me attractive, if they could only just change [**insert thing that cannot be changed here**] It is quite honestly sad, but almost sadistically funny at the same time- because at this point, I have had so many instances of it that I truly believe people do not realize how it affects trans individuals, and the subtle mindfuck it puts us under. I believe that straight, cis people, do not understand the feeling of being gay, and both mentioned will not  *ever* understand gender dysphoria. It‚Äôs not a kink- it cannot be turned on or off in between partners. It‚Äôs a part of our mental state, and to request someone to change that, or make an exception, either for something casual or long term, is really a huge slap in the face. Some examples of messages I have received-

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love for you to be my *wife*‚Äù
‚ÄúJust FYI, I would make you more female, just be prepared for that.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you into feminization at all‚Äù
‚ÄúI love your tits, I hope you keep them.‚Äù

Although it is sad in my eyes how truly little thought and understanding there is given into understanding gender dysphoria, it is quite interesting. But I want to leave off with this message to transgender individuals who may be reading this: do not settle for less, or let anybody force you into suicidal thoughts. Regardless if it‚Äôs a hookup, or a 3 year long relationship, or a best friend. Gender dysphoria is an illness that can only be mediated, not cured, and anyone who does not respect you for who you are, is not worth your wellbeing.

2020-05-15 19:52:54,gkg7hi,3,2,"Okay, so. I live in Texas and if you live in Texas too you know that it's getting hot. Super hot. Already broken 90F a couple times hot.

My ""good"" (read: only fitting pair of) pants are 40W/29L ""relaxed fit"" Wranglers with a very slightly elastic waist. I wear relaxed fit to help with the fact that at 30 y/o and only about 5 months HRT, I have the thicc, juicy rump of your friend's lesbian mom. My good pants fit pretty well over my junky trunk, but they're a bit large in the waist.

Last week I went to buy shorts, because it's getting hot. I figured I needed a smaller waist, so I grabbed some 38W/10L ""relaxed fit"" Wranglers. They did not have any elastic to the waist, but my good pants are barely elastic on the waist and significantly too loose, so I thought it was a reasonable sizing decision. Fitting rooms were closed due to pandemic so I gambled and carried them to the self checkout.

Bad move.

These things are big yikes. First of all, the waist is way too snug, which baffles me because the 40W from the same fucking brand and fit was *at least* two inches too big, but I can cope with this since I'd really only wear them when out walking errands and the waist only really becomes an issue when I sit down and my fat gut rolls over.

The bigger problem is that these fuckers are far from relaxed fit. They hug my supple curves like someone painted them on. These are not men's shorts. These are MILF shorts.

Now, sure. I could exchange them. But to do so I'd either have to walk like 2.5 miles or take a meandering 2 hour bus trip and neither one seems worth the $13 I paid, so I'd rather try to salvage them, probably with some strategic cuts to release some of the tension. They only have to get me through one summer of social isolation so I don't care if they come out looking like some white trash nonsense; *however* the last time I mutilated denim it was women's pants and I was still presenting fairly femme.

I'm not confident that I know how to slice pants up in a way that's not going to just make me look like ""Daisy Duke but like, a really butch lesbian"" so I'm soliciting some advice.

2020-05-16 06:27:58,gkpzh1,4,1,"So I've suffered from depersonalization and some derealization for a significant portion of my life. From maybe 12 or so. Early on in my egg phase I realized that there were a lot of Trans folks who experience dysphoria as depersonalization, and unfortunately that's not where the story ends, but it was a tremendous component and I feel much better. It hit its peak when I was at Disney world, making memories with my family and being totally empty. I thought it might make me feel something again but everything was just boring and shallow, same as everything else in my life. I felt like I was this fake person. Or I was a stand in keeping things in order until the real me came in. The present didn't exist, although most of the time there was a past and a future, what I mean is like it didn't feel like i was experiencing anything happening to me, but I knew the past and I could guess at what happened.

I can measure myself and figure that out fine. I'm sure it will be some expensive trial and error, though. It's hard to sort through all the brands and things, especially when a lot of sources are posting links to out-of-stock items. I need good solid advice on what to buy.

One thing that I keep hearing, though is to get bras with side paneling to keep everything growing forward? the idea of my boobs growing sideways is kind of scary. I've got wide shoulders (but strangely wide hips for someone born male so it kind of evens out?), which means my chest is also fairly broad even though I'm short (like 5'6""). Sometimes I fear I'm built like a goddamn linebacker.

I'm also a bit older (got HRT started just before turning 30), don't know if that matters.

Anyways, hi! I'm An (short for Anathema). I don't post often and am usually too busy with job and personal projects to post.

2020-05-17 04:37:39,gl9bb9,1,1,"Hey y'all! Just wanted to share a little something I've learned over the past few months of being in lockdown. Before starting on HRT 5 months ago, if I didn't shave for a day and a half I had pretty heavy shadow. Like there was no denying my facial hair by that point. Because of that I always made sure to shave \*every single morning\*. I did that up until recently; being stuck at home all the time made me feel a lot less motivated to shave since I'm not really going anywhere so I've been just letting it grow and shaving once it gets pretty serious.  


But what I have noticed the past couple of months is that nowadays my facial hair is \*drastically\* reduced compared to before. The hair is thinner, a lot of it is turning blond, there are patches where it's not really growing much anymore, and it grows way slower. I can go for 2 weeks without shaving and end up with the amount of shadow I'd get after 2 days before.  


So what this has all made me think is that if holding off on electrolysis or laser hair removal is a possibility for any other trans women and you're just starting on HRT, I'd say wait! You never know what kind of effects estrogen will have in that regard, and you could probably save a lot of money if HRT has for you the kind of effect it's been having for me.

Amab. 33. Aussie. Country living.

Pronouns: He/Him (but i don't mind f you say she/her or They/Them)

I've been seeing a gender psychiatrist about being 'gender apathetic (G.A.)' but living as a guy and it's going really well.

Background:
My situation is that i have some dysphoria about how I appear. I also have noticed a pattern that when I'm in a lewd mood, my thoughts of wanting to be more bodily feminine are stronger. Afterwards I'm like 'No way Josay'. However in other non sexy times I do have a yearning for being less masculine bodily too. The doc's idea is to get me on an Anti androgen and see how i feel about transitioning.  Ie take away what could potentially be a sexual motivation and see if the desite to be more gender neutral exists on its own.

I've looked into AGP (Autogynephilia) and from what I've ascertained, it appears that typical AGP'ers are sexually interested in females and are 'girly' or, what's the word 'flamboyant' as children. I was never flamboyant or girly but i never felt male either. Plus I'm into men, sexually which from what i understand is more typical of HSTS folk (Homosexual Trans folk). So it'll be interesting to see what happens on the cyproterone for a few months. 

Above all I'm being honest to my doctor and myself, trusting his expert advice and being honest with my supporters, and am feeling good about where things are at and the plans that are in place. I'm still struggling with accepting being non cisgender but it's a process and God/The Universe is with me so I'm feeling blessed and excited about the future :).

I've told several close friends about starting HRT and they've all been really supportive. 

I told mum last night and dad today (during a bike ride) and they were both really supportive and understanding. Mum is a cool person, dads cool too. I knew they would be okay, since they took to the whole 'gay coming out' thing so well. 

Still, I'm proud that i did involve them and proud of them for being so open minded. I was a tad afraid they'd be all 'that's crazy, do what we say"" but now i feel that i have their support if/when i need their help during my transition. Go boomer! Hehe 

Why am i writing this all out? To say Gday and Out myself to the reddit community I guess. I hope this finds you well and that life is good.
Cheers all

I was never flamboyant or girly but i never felt male either. Plus I\'m into men, sexually which from what i understand is more typical of HSTS folk (Homosexual Trans folk). So it\'ll be interesting to see what happens on the cyproterone for a few months. \n\nAbove all I\'m being honest to my doctor and myself, trusting his expert advice and being honest with my supporters, and am feeling good about where things are at and the plans that are in place. I\'m still struggling with accepting being non cisgender but it\'s a process and God/The Universe is with me so I\'m feeling blessed and excited about the future :).\n\nI\'ve told several close friends about starting HRT and they\'ve all been really supportive. \n\nI told mum last night and dad today (during a bike ride) and they were both really supportive and understanding. Mum is a cool person, dads cool too. I knew they would be okay, since they took to the whole \'gay coming out\' thing so well. \n\nStill, I\'m proud that i did involve them and proud of them for being so open minded. I was a tad afraid they\'d be all \'that\'s crazy, do what we say"" but now i feel that i have their support if/when i need their help during my transition. Go boomer! Hehe \n\nWhy am i writing this all out? To say Gday and Out myself to the reddit community I guess. I hope this finds you well and that life is good.\nCheers all\nSteve', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Gender Apathetic Amab 33 - Came out to parents about possible HRT.

2020-05-18 20:24:02,gm9e2h,4,1,"Basically all my life I have been thinking that I would be so much better off as a woman. I was bullied as a child for looking like a girl. I kept quite a long hair, when I was small I even tried on dresses at home etc. but these desires disappeared for years as I was pressured to behave like a ""normal"" boy. I still enjoy dresses and make up even now when acting occassionaly at a birthday for fun etc. but it's not the most important thing for me. However, I just love playing women, I can express myself more fully this way. I am drawn to the traditional, natural acting, I don't do the drag queen stuff although I enjoy watching a good show. I am saying this because I think this shows I just would like to be a woman to be more true to my nature, as opposed to if I was playing them for fun and show (which is great too, but it's not my primary reason).

Now, I've gone through a lot in my life and I am finally hopefully establishing a more stable and happy place. That's why questions, that may before have been buried under layers of depression and crippling anxiety, start to emerge. I have been considering transition for about 9 months now. I wanted to talk about it with a proffesional but they are so occupied in my country that you wait even a year for your first appointment. Besides, they were quite insensitive when I phoned them which put me off, given they work with often psychologically ill people. So I just continued with other life duties but now even one friend of mine told me I should consider transition because he feels as if I were a woman inside, that he knows no other man like me. And it's not because I would look feminine now at 25. I didn't confide my feelings with him either, this occured to him independently, so I began to contemplate it again. 

Since reddit has helped me a lot in many regards, I thought I could ask here for the time being before I can talk with an expert. I realise nobody can give me a definite answer, I must decide on my own, but I am just wondering if there are trans people who were also drawn to transition more because of their personality and possibility to express their true self and who might not have gender dysphoria (I still feel ashamed for my body hair though, but that's probably body dysphoria, right?), but who still feel they would be much more content as women. I know it has to do a lot with societal norms about what men/women ""should do and be like"" so I am not sure if my desire to be a woman isn't misplaced. If it's not just a wish to be allowed to be more true to my nature without being shunned by society according to their fossilized ideas about men and women. I am just too different as a man with my character and it makes me lonely... I was often excluded from girl groups just because I was a boy, it had nothing to do with my personality. I should also mention I'm gay and my fellow gays have hurt me a lot, I feel I don't belong in their community at all. I don't have a single good friend among gays after so many years. In general, I'd say I mostly get along best with women, and I even have great relationships with three of them that are around 50, we are just on the same wavelength. 

I must also add that a school psychologist suggested transition for me when I was 15. At that time, I was severely bullied and could think only at that. The fact she suggested transition only caused me a terrible panic attack because she confirmed that I was feminine - the reason I was being bullied. Of course, transition was off the table as this would only multiply the bullying and I just tried to forget it. As you see, the topic returned but now I can see it in a much more positive light without worrying too much what would people think.

However, the main point for me isn't the physical gender per se, it's the fact that no matter what my body looks like, it's still me inside. I don't want to build my identity around labels - e.g. gay man just doesn't do me (or anyone for that matter) justice. But I believe a woman body would allow me to be myself more freely and happily.

Truth is, I admire the bravery of all of you!",trans,(25M) I feel more like a woman than a man but I don't have gender dysphoria.

I am saying this because I think this shows I just would like to be a woman to be more true to my nature, as opposed to if I was playing them for fun and show (which is great too, but it\'s not my primary reason).\n\nNow, I\'ve gone through a lot in my life and I am finally hopefully establishing a more stable and happy place. That\'s why questions, that may before have been buried under layers of depression and crippling anxiety, start to emerge. I have been considering transition for about 9 months now. I wanted to talk about it with a proffesional but they are so occupied in my country that you wait even a year for your first appointment. Besides, they were quite insensitive when I phoned them which put me off, given they work with often psychologically ill people. So I just continued with other life duties but now even one friend of mine told me I should consider transition because he feels as if I were a woman inside, that he knows no other man like me. And it\'s not because I would look feminine now at 25. I didn\'t confide my feelings with him either, this occured to him independently, so I began to contemplate it again. \n\nSince reddit has helped me a lot in many regards, I thought I could ask here for the time being before I can talk with an expert. I realise nobody can give me a definite answer, I must decide on my own, but I am just wondering if there are trans people who were also drawn to transition more because of their personality and possibility to express their true self and who might not have gender dysphoria (I still feel ashamed for my body hair though, but that\'s probably body dysphoria, right?), but who still feel they would be much more content as women. I know it has to do a lot with societal norms about what men/women ""should do and be like"" so I am not sure if my desire to be a woman isn\'t misplaced. If it\'s not just a wish to be allowed to be more true to my nature without being shunned by society according to their fossilized ideas about men and women. I am just too different as a man with my character and it makes me lonely... I was often excluded from girl groups just because I was a boy, it had nothing to do with my personality. I should also mention I\'m gay and my fellow gays have hurt me a lot, I feel I don\'t belong in their community at all. I don\'t have a single good friend among gays after so many years. In general, I\'d say I mostly get along best with women, and I even have great relationships with three of them that are around 50, we are just on the same wavelength. \n\nI must also add that a school psychologist suggested transition for me when I was 15. At that time, I was severely bullied and could think only at that. The fact she suggested transition only caused me a terrible panic attack because she confirmed that I was feminine - the reason I was being bullied. Of course, transition was off the table as this would only multiply the bullying and I just tried to forget it. As you see, the topic returned but now I can see it in a much more positive light without worrying too much what would people think.\n\nHowever, the main point for me isn\'t the physical gender per se, it\'s the fact that no matter what my body looks like, it\'s still me inside. I don\'t want to build my identity around labels - e.g. gay man just doesn\'t do me (or anyone for that matter) justice. But I believe a woman body would allow me to be myself more freely and happily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. If I did some terminology wrong or wrote something that could be offensive, please be lenient, I am quite new to all this and it\'s unintentional.

a week ago I figured out that genderfluid people don't want to be a guy :"") (wow what a discovery) and other factors that made me sure that I was a transguy, it was super hard to accept it and it still is.

My body is decently feminine. Apart from my broad shoulders, I have a slim, curvy-ish frame. That‚Äôs basically the only feminine thing about me though.

My calves have always been crazy hairy, but recently the hairs gotten even thicker. And up until a few months ago, my thighs were spotless, now they‚Äôre almost completely covered. I‚Äôve never shaved my legs before because both my parents just laughed when I asked them. I didn‚Äôt tell them it was because I want to feel feminine, I told them ‚ÄúI just wanna‚Äù like a dumbass.

I just can‚Äôt work up the courage to tell her, it feels even harder to tell her than when I came out as Bi. I keep seeing all these posts of MtFs saying that wearing a skirt was absolutely amazing. I just get so jealous and end up crying. That brings me to my third topic, emotions. Almost everytime I go on this subreddit or r/transtimelines , I start crying.

2020-05-20 08:48:56,gn7syg,1,1,"Tomorrow is my 6 month mark on my medical transition and I just wanted to say that this journey hasn't been easy for me. I think it's safe to say that this journey hasn't been easy for the majority of us. From a rocky childhood to migrating to a new country to falling in love and experiencing an incredible amount in my 19 years of life, my gender dysphoria has always sat on my back in one way or another. 

There was a point when I forgot how to laugh like I used to, how to cry, how to feel 'okay' in my own body and mind.

I just wanted to make this post to say that transitioning is not linear. Transitioning is up, and down, and a little bit all over the place. Transitioning is self-doubt, sacrifice, and social pressure--but it's also the opposite. For the first time in years, I'm laughing at the little things. I'm laughing at jokes and things that I would've rolled my eyes at or simply been numb to before. I didn't realize how unhappy I was before because it had become normal. 

But here I am, laughing at dad jokes. Here I am, laughing at the silly things. Here I am, still dysphoric and still struggling with the things any teen/young adult struggles with, but here I am seeing the world without such a grainy, gray lens.

Repeat: You are enough. You are beautiful. Your soul is magical. Your past trauma does not define you. You are stronger than your gender dysphoria and you CAN and WILL thrive.

The old me would've balked at this post, at the frill of it, but the old me is gone. The ""old me"" was a facade.

Here's to 6 months on E, and here's to the (mostly good) Reddit knowledge and informative users. Without this forum and other trans forums, I'm not sure where I would be. Transitioning would be a shot in the dark. 

I am truly thankful &lt;3

So I have a transgender friend and she is a really amazing person, she is smart, curious, kind, sweet a free spirit and I really enjoy have her as my penpal.

So she was confident enough to send me her photos and ...can I say that I doubted that was actually her when we talked I assumed that she was very girly, long hair and everything but she wasn't that and she looked so sad and in my reply, I suggested that she soul smile more as I wrote to her "" because I am sure that your smile is absolutely lovely"".

So there is my question she usually asks about my opinion on girly thigh ( and my tomboy's brain try hard to be helpful whit few result) and now I am scared that if she asks me about something on her appearance I can hurt her feeling and I will never forgive myself if I do so.

She is in a very rough period whit her family too soo I want to make sure that I can be a safe place for her, so I thought that I can suggest that maybe she can let her hair grow even I little or wear more yewlery and makeup but I am not sure if this will be appropriate can somebody help me?",trans,Is ok to give advice about my transgender friend appearance?,1590028776.0,"{'created_utc': 1590003576, 'id': 'gni9xt', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have a transgender friend and she is a really amazing person, she is smart, curious, kind, sweet a free spirit and I really enjoy have her as my penpal.\n\nSo she was confident enough to send me her photos and ...can I say that I doubted that was actually her when we talked I assumed that she was very girly, long hair and everything but she wasn\'t that and she looked so sad and in my reply, I suggested that she soul smile more as I wrote to her "" because I am sure that your smile is absolutely lovely"".\n\nSo there is my question she usually asks about my opinion on girly thigh ( and my tomboy\'s brain try hard to be helpful whit few result) and now I am scared that if she asks me about something on her appearance I can hurt her feeling and I will never forgive myself if I do so.\n\nShe is in a very rough period whit her family too soo I want to make sure that I can be a safe place for her, so I thought that I can suggest that maybe she can let her hair grow even I little or wear more yewlery and makeup but I am not sure if this will be appropriate can somebody help me?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Is ok to give advice about my transgender friend appearance?', 'created': 1590028776.0}"

2020-05-21 08:08:51,gnsrnq,2,1,"TL;DR: Dysphoria blows. Society blows. Reddit is a good pillow to scream into.

I was having an alright day until my girlfriend and I went to go run errands. I was originally looking forward to it, feeling good about myself, and then I saw myself in the shirt I'd picked out. I've been cracked for a week and am only out to 7 people, so I haven't really gotten to dress up feminine at all, much less for going out on the town. I've painted my nails once, and brushed my thankfully already grown out hair in a few different ways, but nothing so far as far as actual blouses, skirts, girlpant^tm, etc.

Today for this I'm wearing one of my tighter boy shirts, boy jeans, my hair's in a pretty androgynous ponytail, and that nail polish has fallen apart more and more with each passing day, so I take one look at that mirror and my reflection is just screaming at me. We get in the car and sing along to the radio, and my voice does the same. Went into 3 different stores, two of them on my own (because disabled gf can't walk around as much, happy to be her support just as much as she is mine), and even though most people were probably just doing their fucking shopping, it still felt like I was getting stared at by everyone at each place, even the people who literally did not see me.

Built up to the point of crying once I got back to my car the third time. We went home, and while I was eventually able to calm down with the help of my girly and animal crossing and ice cream, I still felt dysphoric aftershocks for most of the night, and all-in-all, one of the worst things I've ever felt, one of the worst times I've ever had.

2020-05-21 12:20:29,gnvu8l,4,1,"As far as I can go back in my memory as a kid I spent every night laying in bed day dreaming before and after I fell asleep that I would be turned in a girl and could do girly things and wear pretty girl clothes like disney princess dresses. I did it in a werid way though. The adults in my life, the media, and my peers raised me in the thought that boys or strong and manly while girls are weak and stupid so even as a kid I had toxic masculinity like I can't be like this and I have to be better than girls. I pretend liked I didn't like thinking about getting to wear all sorts of different girly oufits, getting long girly hair styles, and getting to do stereotypical female things with girls but in reality I the thought of these things made me so happy. I was in denial to the point that it took me 8 years until I admitted I didn't hate it because I wanted to hate it so bad but the thought of being a girl in a beautiful dress mad me so happy I couldn't stop thinking about it. In these daydreams girls that sometimes I knew and sometimes I didn't but always my age would capture me, tie me up, cut off my penis ( I was four so I didn't know what a vagina so I just assumed that girls had nothing there and pee out of their butt so I thought that made me physically a girl ), dress me up as girl usually in something super girly especially disney princess dresses, sometimes give me womens hair styles like long pigtails, I would be forced to do girly things with them, and sometimes send me to a place with a lot of other feminized guys sometimes I knew others times I didn't but always my age. I still don't know what that means but I know I did it for years as a kid and desperately wanted to hate it but always loved it. I was raised in a very conservative and chirstan family who wouldn't talk about lgbtq things. Hell one member of my anuts is atheist and my family says shit about her for being an atheist behind her back. It would be years before I heard about gay people, trans people, crossdressers, and drag queens. I finally got to try on womens clothes one day when I was no younger than 4 but no older than 6 when at my grandparents house I swapped clothes with my cousin. She was wearing a cute fake jaguar skin top with a matching fake jaguar skin skirt. I felt so alive and powerful. That was so much fun and was of the fun experiences I can remember until my grandparents caught us. My grandparents scolded, insulted, and punished us. They told us under no circumstances we could wear clothes of the opposite gender again. When my parents came a picked me up my grandparents told my parents what happened so then my parents scolded, insulted, and punished me. It wasn't until I was 7-9 that I was able to summon the courage to try and crossdress again. I tried to wear one of my sisters dresses. My sister didn't care and told me I could but right before I started to change my mom caught me and scolded, insulted, and punished me again. When I was 12 I had my first boner but not thinking about a girl or a guy I got it thinking about wearing a pretty dress. It was odd and still don't know what to think about it. Even today while yes I occasionally get boners looking at or thinking about girls or guys I usually get them from thinking about something releated to crossdressing, being a girl, or tg tf sissy captions. I didn't know what mascurbation when I was 12 so thinking about the stuff I talked about before would somethimes make me handless cum which I hated so that is how I stopped doing that. Sorry yes I do have to talk about sissy captions though. When I was 12 a few mounths after the first boner I found them and it was an insane moment for me. I found out I wasn't alone their are other people like me. I thought I was a freak and the only person like me on the planet so it felt so good to find out their was a place wear I belonged. Yes the fact that sissy captions was what I found is probably not good. I wish I could of found drag queens or I would not of found out about trans people from my transphobic uncle instead of sissys but I would be lying if I didn't have the same reaction like a life of confusion and fear is finally making since knowing you actually belong.  A year after that I entered jr. high were my friends got me super into anime and the next two years we were all weebs ( I still am but now like a episode a week not four a day). One thing that really caught my eye were traps. I fell in love with and wished I was one of them. I wished I was cute, got to wear cute outfits, do girly things, have everyone think you are a girl, and be treated as a girl even though I am a boy. I could never bring myself to crossplay even though I wanted to so badly. I rember wishing I could look like a human version of raven from teen titans so when I got to high school with no one I knew everyone would be shocked that I was a guy because I looked like a girl. I knew I wanted to look like a girl 24/7, sound like a girl 24/7, be treated like a girl 24/7, and dress like a girl 24/7 but I told myself that I'm not trans I'm just a crossdresser or a trap because I still have a dick. At the beginning of 8 grade I decided to grow out my hair. I don't know why I did I just did and oh my god it was great. My long hair ment so much to me. I would look in the mirror and feel happy to see something I like. I would watch it grow and get longer feeling ecstatic. My family didn't feel the same. They would constantly bully me for it saying it looked bad and I should cut it. I can't count how often I was told to cut it. Some family members would offer to take me to get it cut right then and their and pay completely out of their pocket just so it would be gone. Finally I gave in and got it cut right before high school. I liked it short for the first day but after that first day I was filled with regret, frustration, sadness, and anger. I hated my hair so so so much. I never really liked my body but I never really realised how much I hated it until I had something I liked about it and lost it. I cut my hair right before I started freshman year and now I am about to start senior years and that haircut I just talked about is my most recent. My hair thankfully goes down to my breasts and my hair means the world to me. When I look in the mirror I try to look look at my hair and blue eyes because those are the only things I like about my body. I am to fat, everything about my face is ugly, I wish I was short but I am 5""11 which sucks, I could go on and fucking on. When I look in the mirror I feel sad, pist, frustrated, sick, and I want to punch the mirror. I don't like taking pictures of myself or being in pictures. Its no accident that my Instagram that I have had for over 3 years only has one picture of me posted on it. I guess I should talk about high school which has been werid and shit. Things turned from wouldn't it be great to why the hell can't I have it. I feel awkard using male locker rooms and male bathrooms everywear. Whenever family members or friends of my family who knew me as a kid comes up to me and says how I have grown up or are growing up to be such as strong handsome young man I feel sad, awkward, and sick. Whenever you have to mark are you a boy or a girl I feel awkward, pist and sick. When other is provided I usually choose other but even other doesn't feel right. I wear nail polish and makeup which are just the best and I love them but I am broke and can't drive so I need my parents help but they always get in my way and try to stop me so I have very little and have to spread out my use. At least they let me buy nail polish and make up though. They won't let me pierce my ears because I'm not a girl. I'm not gonna lie when I asked and they said no and told me that my sister can because she is a girl but I can't because I am not it really hurt. I finally got the courage to crossdress again and decided to crossplay yuri from doki doki but my parents stopped me. I am only 17 and I tried cosplaing yuri when I was 16 so I have no credit card or ability to drive so everything I buys goes through my parents. You could argue that I should ask my friends but I am a depressed, self hatting, socially anxious, shy, weird, loner, outcast, emo kid. I only have one friend. I can and have turned to him for help with many things but not with this because while my family is more of a scold and insult were it comes to drag stuff his is more the beat your ass type. I felt so sad, hopless, and envy so much envy at the con. Its like every other girl I see feels me with envy. Why can't I be her. Why aren't I a girl why wasn't I born a girl. Look she doesn't even care that she has it why can't I have it. For years now I have felt depressed and hated my body. I think I might be trans but I may not. I have gender dysphoria but I don't have bottom dysphoria. I don't love my dick but I don't hate it either it is just kind of there. Sure if I was offered a pill that could magically turn it into a vagina I would take it but I probably won't pay thousands of dollars and go through a painful surgery to get rid of it. I hear these horror stories from trans people both mtf and ftn about how bad their bottom dysphoria is and I have just never felt it. Also it might just be a fetish because I might have a problem. Every since I was 15 I have mascurbated to stuff like tg tf captions like 8 times I week. Its like everyday I think about being sexy get horny and jerk off. I worried I am just a fetish. I don't want to transition if I am just a fetish but I really want to transition. I really hate being a guy. I don't think non binary would cut it but that would be so much better than being a guy. I really want to be a girl. Sure when I watch straight porn I wish I was the girl but that could just be a fetish. Yes when I close my eyes I am a girl, when I dream about the future I am a girl, when I think about love I am girl, and when I think about ny wedding I am a girl but could all still just be a fetish. I thought well I should probably ask trans people if I am trans or just a fetish because fuck if I know. Sorry this was so long and I know no one read it or even seen it but I needed to rant.

Hell one member of my anuts is atheist and my family says shit about her for being an atheist behind her back. It would be years before I heard about gay people, trans people, crossdressers, and drag queens. I finally got to try on womens clothes one day when I was no younger than 4 but no older than 6 when at my grandparents house I swapped clothes with my cousin. She was wearing a cute fake jaguar skin top with a matching fake jaguar skin skirt. I felt so alive and powerful. That was so much fun and was of the fun experiences I can remember until my grandparents caught us. My grandparents scolded, insulted, and punished us. They told us under no circumstances we could wear clothes of the opposite gender again. When my parents came a picked me up my grandparents told my parents what happened so then my parents scolded, insulted, and punished me. It wasn\'t until I was 7-9 that I was able to summon the courage to try and crossdress again. I tried to wear one of my sisters dresses. My sister didn\'t care and told me I could but right before I started to change my mom caught me and scolded, insulted, and punished me again. When I was 12 I had my first boner but not thinking about a girl or a guy I got it thinking about wearing a pretty dress. It was odd and still don\'t know what to think about it. Even today while yes I occasionally get boners looking at or thinking about girls or guys I usually get them from thinking about something releated to crossdressing, being a girl, or tg tf sissy captions. I didn\'t know what mascurbation when I was 12 so thinking about the stuff I talked about before would somethimes make me handless cum which I hated so that is how I stopped doing that. Sorry yes I do have to talk about sissy captions though. When I was 12 a few mounths after the first boner I found them and it was an insane moment for me. I found out I wasn\'t alone their are other people like me. I thought I was a freak and the only person like me on the planet so it felt so good to find out their was a place wear I belonged. Yes the fact that sissy captions was what I found is probably not good. I wish I could of found drag queens or I would not of found out about trans people from my transphobic uncle instead of sissys but I would be lying if I didn\'t have the same reaction like a life of confusion and fear is finally making since knowing you actually belong.  A year after that I entered jr. high were my friends got me super into anime and the next two years we were all weebs ( I still am but now like a episode a week not four a day). One thing that really caught my eye were traps. I fell in love with and wished I was one of them. I wished I was cute, got to wear cute outfits, do girly things, have everyone think you are a girl, and be treated as a girl even though I am a boy. I could never bring myself to crossplay even though I wanted to so badly. I rember wishing I could look like a human version of raven from teen titans so when I got to high school with no one I knew everyone would be shocked that I was a guy because I looked like a girl. I knew I wanted to look like a girl 24/7, sound like a girl 24/7, be treated like a girl 24/7, and dress like a girl 24/7 but I told myself that I\'m not trans I\'m just a crossdresser or a trap because I still have a dick. At the beginning of 8 grade I decided to grow out my hair. I don\'t know why I did I just did and oh my god it was great. My long hair ment so much to me. I would look in the mirror and feel happy to see something I like. I would watch it grow and get longer feeling ecstatic. My family didn\'t feel the same. They would constantly bully me for it saying it looked bad and I should cut it. I can\'t count how often I was told to cut it. Some family members would offer to take me to get it cut right then and their and pay completely out of their pocket just so it would be gone. Finally I gave in and got it cut right before high school. I liked it short for the first day but after that first day I was filled with regret, frustration, sadness, and anger. I hated my hair so so so much. I never really liked my body but I never really realised how much I hated it until I had something I liked about it and lost it. I cut my hair right before I started freshman year and now I am about to start senior years and that haircut I just talked about is my most recent. My hair thankfully goes down to my breasts and my hair means the world to me. When I look in the mirror I try to look look at my hair and blue eyes because those are the only things I like about my body. I am to fat, everything about my face is ugly, I wish I was short but I am 5""11 which sucks, I could go on and fucking on. When I look in the mirror I feel sad, pist, frustrated, sick, and I want to punch the mirror. I don\'t like taking pictures of myself or being in pictures. Its no accident that my Instagram that I have had for over 3 years only has one picture of me posted on it. I guess I should talk about high school which has been werid and shit. Things turned from wouldn\'t it be great to why the hell can\'t I have it. I feel awkard using male locker rooms and male bathrooms everywear. Whenever family members or friends of my family who knew me as a kid comes up to me and says how I have grown up or are growing up to be such as strong handsome young man I feel sad, awkward, and sick. Whenever you have to mark are you a boy or a girl I feel awkward, pist and sick. When other is provided I usually choose other but even other doesn\'t feel right. I wear nail polish and makeup which are just the best and I love them but I am broke and can\'t drive so I need my parents help but they always get in my way and try to stop me so I have very little and have to spread out my use. At least they let me buy nail polish and make up though. They won\'t let me pierce my ears because I\'m not a girl. I\'m not gonna lie when I asked and they said no and told me that my sister can because she is a girl but I can\'t because I am not it really hurt. I finally got the courage to crossdress again and decided to crossplay yuri from doki doki but my parents stopped me. I am only 17 and I tried cosplaing yuri when I was 16 so I have no credit card or ability to drive so everything I buys goes through my parents. You could argue that I should ask my friends but I am a depressed, self hatting, socially anxious, shy, weird, loner, outcast, emo kid. I only have one friend. I can and have turned to him for help with many things but not with this because while my family is more of a scold and insult were it comes to drag stuff his is more the beat your ass type. I felt so sad, hopless, and envy so much envy at the con. Its like every other girl I see feels me with envy. Why can\'t I be her. Why aren\'t I a girl why wasn\'t I born a girl. Look she doesn\'t even care that she has it why can\'t I have it. For years now I have felt depressed and hated my body. I think I might be trans but I may not. I have gender dysphoria but I don\'t have bottom dysphoria. I don\'t love my dick but I don\'t hate it either it is just kind of there. Sure if I was offered a pill that could magically turn it into a vagina I would take it but I probably won\'t pay thousands of dollars and go through a painful surgery to get rid of it. I hear these horror stories from trans people both mtf and ftn about how bad their bottom dysphoria is and I have just never felt it. Also it might just be a fetish because I might have a problem. Every since I was 15 I have mascurbated to stuff like tg tf captions like 8 times I week. Its like everyday I think about being sexy get horny and jerk off. I worried I am just a fetish. I don\'t want to transition if I am just a fetish but I really want to transition. I really hate being a guy. I don\'t think non binary would cut it but that would be so much better than being a guy. I really want to be a girl. Sure when I watch straight porn I wish I was the girl but that could just be a fetish. Yes when I close my eyes I am a girl, when I dream about the future I am a girl, when I think about love I am girl, and when I think about ny wedding I am a girl but could all still just be a fetish. I thought well I should probably ask trans people if I am trans or just a fetish because fuck if I know. Sorry this was so long and I know no one read it or even seen it but I needed to rant.

I heard about ""shemales"" in pop culture more often and do not completely understand the concept. As far as I understood it I thought keeping a penis after transitioning would make the person suffer from gender dysphoria. I always thought a penis war a very- well symbol of men. Thus I thought that having a penis as a woman would not be nice to said women.
But I think that means I misunderstood maybe.

My question is- do some women after transitioning actually keep their penises or is that just a pop-culture clishee and rumour?
If it is indeed true- why do they or you in particular choose to do it, if it's not too rude of me to ask?

Join us for a live Q&amp;A session with a medical provider and staff from the Fenway Health Trans Health Program who will answer your questions about gender-affirming care.\n\n**This month\'s topic will be chest binding.** Each month, we plan to talk about a different topic related to gender-affirming care. You can join us through Zoom and ask your questions directly. You can also submit your questions ahead of time to [transhealth@fenwayhealth.org](mailto:transhealth@fenwayhealth.org)with  the subject line, ""Trans Health  Q&amp;A"". We will record the     Q&amp;A sessions and post them on our website to access anytime.\n\n**These sessions will take place every month on the 1st Wednesday of every month from noon‚Äì1 p.m.** EST. Stay tuned for future discussion topics. Please reach out to [transhealth@fenwayhealth.org](mailto:transhealth@fenwayhealth.org) with any questions or concerns.\n\nCan\'t make it to the live Q&amp;A?

Like, what things do you look back on and think ""well no wonder I was unhappy"" while, in the moment, you just assumed feeling bad was for another reason, or just a normal way to feel? 

\---

I had major and protracted childhood trauma that lead directly into years of depression. Getting out of the toxic and abusive environment I grew up in was a major factor in recovery, as was therapy in that it helped equip me with the tools and context I needed to actively engage in personal growth and healing. While the trauma resulted in a variety of issues, my 'depression' always seemed so detached and unrelated once I was in a better environment. I didn't feel sad, helpless, etc in regards to my experience - just angry and frustrated. Sure, I had a lot of long-lasting issues that were easily traceable to abuse, but depression just felt so... separate. 

Long after working through the worst of things, I'd still find myself caught up on weird stuff and not quite able to articulate what was 'wrong'. The stuff that sent me into depressive periods seemed random and unpredictable. In recent years, prior to realizing I was nonbinary, being able to act/speak/dress/cut my hair/etc the way that made me happiest in a loving, supportive environment free of gendered criticism meant being able to just be 'me', and a lot of the biggest issues around my depression just... went away. However, it wasn't until I experienced others referring to me with they/them and asking my preferred pronouns that the final pieces slammed into place; I describe it like flashing lights and fireworks going off in my head, ""!THIS!IS!RIGHT!"" The pressure was suddenly completely off to be anything else other than myself - and it was really startling to realize how much of that remaining pressure came from within.

 So much intense discomfort over the years I had chalked up to depression/anxiety was suddenly, obviously, dysphoria from being forced, or forcing myself, to conform to gendered expectations. Being able to recognize that certain things gave me gender euphoria, and *that* was why I kept seeking them out, was a brainblast. I was no longer cripplingly depressed for 'no reason' on regular basis because I was no longer dealing with the bulk of the stuff that had felt 'normal', but was making me unhappy.   


Having my favorite shirt thrown away while I was at school because it was for the 'wrong gender' wasn't upsetting *just* because it was in invasion of my privacy and destruction of my property, it hurt because there were REASONS that was my favorite shirt, even if I didn't realize them. Being criticized for my voice and manner of speaking wasn't hurtful *just* because I felt embarrassed for not being 'acceptable', but because I was being forced to shift from just being 'me' towards a gendered presentation that didn't feel comfortable.  I had no say in my hair, my wardrobe, what sports/activities I was allowed to participate in; I faced heavy criticism and limitation on what hobbies I was allowed to pursue, music I could listen to, and even what exercise I could engage in on my own time because - content aside - certain things were for the 'wrong' gender for me to enjoy them. There's so much stuff I look back on now where it seems obvious to me that my unhappiness wasn't merely a response to lack of personal autonomy, but the denial of my *identity*. I didn't identify with my AGAB, but didn't realize there was any other option - like how you might feel unhappy living in the dark, scrabbling mostly blind and seeing by tiny rays of light making it through cracks here and there, but wouldn't know to miss the sun if you didn't even know it existed, or taught that those that seek it out are mentally ill.

2020-05-22 15:00:21,gokwrb,4,7,Hi everyone! Hope you are all safe and sound during the quarantine. I'm 23 years old and finally have been coming to terms with my gender. Luckily I found a friend on reddit 4 days ago whom I opened myself up to for the first time about my gender. I have never felt better. With her support and motivation I finally went to buy my first pair of panties. When I went to the store I was very scared and my heart was beating heavily and I circled around the underwear stand for at least 30 minutes. But I finally grabbed a package with 3 pairs of panties and didn't even look back. Put them in front of the cashier with confidence and even though she gave me a little weird look I didn't care. I was taking the first step to being myself and never felt happier. I want thank my friend again for her massive support. I couldn't have done it without you Emily!

2020-05-22 15:24:04,golc40,10,2,"Hi. I posted this question in another, non-trans specific (LGBT) subreddit thread (I'm assuming it got buried since I got zero responses). I would like to engage in discussion on an idea/response to those who have sexually transitioned, are thinking about it, an ally, or other individual. I have not been able to resolve this question personally.

Before we go any further, because I realize this likely going to be a controversial topic, I want to emphasize that my goal is quality discussion. I'm not looking to start or engage in a fight, personal attacks, bigotry, etc. If you want to get nasty, you are free to do so, but you won't get a response. If I feel a discussion is going down hill, I'll discontinue participating in that discussion. The below example was an attempt to be somewhat preposterous as an example. I trust you all can read between the lines.

If I feel, with all my being, that I am a lizard, does that make me a lizard? Is it realistic to request that others call me a lizard? Whatever the answer is to you, how does this relate to you, or those who have transitioned sexually?

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but I guess any help is good help!

So, I'm looking for some help. A couple months back, I met an FtM and we began chatting a lot, recently things became a lot more serious and we started dating. Sounds great and all, and I'm really happy about it, but I just have a situation that I keep finding myself in.

I've never done this to them, thankfully, but anytime I'm talking to my mates about them, I keep ending up using the incorrect pronouns, and stumbling over my words to correct myself. They prefer to go by He/Him, yet I keep finding myself using She/Her, completely unintentionally. I end up feeling shitty about it, and just one day worry that I might end up misgendering them and upsetting them, which I **really** don't want to have happen.

My question is, is there anything I can do at all that can help me in this situation? I guess it's just a fact that the more I use the correct pronouns over and over, the less I'll fuck it up, but I just really don't want to put myself, or him, in a situation were we both come out of it badly.

Hi! I am a cis-gendered female lesbian, currently dating a heckin cute ass girl. She is trans, and I‚Äôm needing help!

To fellow trans women here, (and others dating trans!), what can I do to help her sexually? I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôll end up using a wrong term for her genitalia, and cause her to be dysphoric and/or become self conscious. I think she‚Äôs beautiful regardless, and I‚Äôd love to go down on her. She‚Äôs given me consent, and we‚Äôve talked about it plenty! But this specific thing, I‚Äôm afraid to mention because I don‚Äôt want her to think I don‚Äôt see her as a women! Because I do!

She still has the genitalia that she had at birth. I, personally, have never had experience with it. I was never really a sexual person.. until I met her. She really knows how to push my buttons and make me want to top her, etc. (I‚Äôm already a top regardless, just no experience). But for some reason, every time we get sexual, she only goes down on me. (Power bottom), she has voiced that she‚Äôd love for me to do the same to her, but something keeps stopping me? How do I overcome the shyness/anxiety?

I think she‚Äôs vvvvvv attractive, and her genitalia does not bother me at all! I‚Äôm just inexperienced and nervous to do it. What if she doesn‚Äôt orgasm? Then what‚Äôs the point? I‚Äôve heard that sometimes for transwomen, the estrogen makes it hard for them to get off.

I‚Äôm basically just looking for tips and advice.

Actually, I'm not really sure if I'm a trans girl, but I don't like my body, and I really want to shape it more feminine, but I have no idea how to do it.  
 I managed to lose 30kg I used to weigh 101 kg 6 months ago, now I weigh 71.I'm 1.73 cm (5.67 ft). So technically I have a normal weight, however I still have extra weight on my belly. It is impossible for me to go to a gym because of the quarantine. And I have no idea what routines I have to do to lose weight and feminize my body. I tried for days to do varied exercise routines, but after 20 minutes I'm exhausted. Could you help me? :(  
 I want to have a flat tummy and a more curvy body, but I do not know how to exercise properly, and I am afraid that due to ignorance, I will shape a body more masculine than feminine.   
 Obviously in my possibilities, because I'm not in hrt, but I know I want a more feminine body and I'm frustrated not being able to get it

2020-05-24 17:08:38,gptak0,4,1,"Hello everybody! I'm completely new to this subreddit and I haven't been able to work up the nerve to say anything. To anybody. In real life at least... Sadly I don't feel safe revealing my age for numerous reasons, but I was born a male, but god decided to screw me over. I... I'm just doing this out of impulse, I've never been good at really good at controlling my impulses and I'm an emotional gal! But hey, coming out to the wonderful people here is a step in the right direction! (I think. Sweating bullets over here, hope somebody responds so I'm not stuck being nervous hahah).

Part 1: Beginnings.

A while ago I, seemingly as a joke, decided to masquerade as a girl online. I was worried that I'd get caught so I made up an entire backstory about how I have a lot of trauma (I don't know why. I've always been a really good storyteller though and I thought that if I kind of fleshed out a backstory I'd be suspected less. I was accepted immediately. I feel horrible about lying about the trauma, but I've been with traumatic people before, all were girls, so there's a chance that I've associated trauma as a feminine thing.) I thought it was the strangest thing. They said right off the bat ""Yeah no, she's a girl. She acts like one, has feminine speech patterns, talks about all the girl stuff with us"" when someone said ""but is ""she"" really a girl?"". As things went by it felt more natural. There was something.. Calming. I liked it, I liked being that girl. The girl I told people about was malnourished because of stress, 5'1, brown hair, things like that. In reality I'm actually 5'10 and (kind) fat. It felt natural and comfortable.

Part 2: Realization.

All of the pieces kind of started to come together. I was talking to a 33 year old trans female online. Her name was Alyson, although she didn't divulge her last name, as she said a major news company did something on her, accusing her of being a crazy feminist that pretty much hates all men. I haven't been able to dig anything up on her mainly because of lack of trying, I wasn't that interested. I saw the emotion in her text (How I can do that is a different story hahah) and she was almost frantic in the insistence of ""no I don't want people to know who I am"", and I've managed to somehow talk about what trans is being like with her without saying ""I'm not who I am, I've been lying.) My Dysphoria (Yes, I figured I had that.) Appeared one time. I was in the mall and I thought ""Hey... What if.. What if I tried walking more feminine?"" And I liked it. But then I saw myself in the reflection of a shop window and I was reminded ""Oh.. I still have a guys body."" And I stopped. I started piecing things together. I was, 1: Always very emotional, 2: Very empathetic, 3: Very prone to tears, 4: Loved drama, 4: Loved art, 5: Had a huge passion for music, 6: Stretched very often, you know that stretch that a lot of girls do where they raise both arms above their head in a kind of helix way and arch their back, stretching like that. Men don't usually stretch or are very flexible, I stretch a lot XD 7: Always loved curling up with a blanket, sipping a beverage, 8: Huge book nerd!!! Books rock! 9: Always was very dispassionate for sports, except for tennis, 10: Always enjoyed an enclosed friend group, 11: Always kind of disliked being rowdy. The noise, it just.. Ugh. Boys can be so annoying, and 12: I am \*very\* insistent on having longer hair, never knew why, 13: When I saw male characters in movies or read that in books I was like ""Oh, cool, they're interesting."" But when it was a female character I was... Fixated on it almost, I almost looked up to them, wanted to be like them. Take a look at that list, if you looked at it, would you guess that I was a male or female? I'm still uncertain, I want to consciously make differences to how I am to seem more feminine, when I just realized: ""Wait. I'm.. Kinda already feminine. Huh.""

Part 3: Fear.

I feel like it's a race. I know that there are irreversible changes once puberty is done. But it's so scary, trying to come out to my mother. She's a counselor, and an advocate of LGBT, and when talking about lovers in the future she always said ""girlfriend or boyfriend"", stuff like that. I know she'd support me, but it's a race against my fear. It's this malicious creature. I can outpace it but the moment I falter it wraps around me, making me stop. Making me fearful. What if I'm not trans? What if it's a huge mistake? I think I \*should\* reveal my age and I don't want to go and edit it. I want people to see my emotion in this, it's a way of me boosting my confidence and I hope to god someone sees this and comments something short like ""Nah it's fine. You'll be good."" I'm 13. I don't seem it, do I? I'm.. Unusually mature for my age hahah. If you respond to this, please don't treat me like a child, treat me like you'd treat your peers because **I very well might be as mature and smart as them.** I don't know how to come out, if it's a mistake or not.. It's like my age is a clock that keeps ticking down, every second gone promising that transitioning will be harder as time goes on as fear paralyses me. I can't move. Then I find a gap, a speck of light that is ""No. I'm me."" I follow that train of thought, imagine myself chatting with the girls, fussing over each others hair and laughing. But that light then gets snuffed out. It's.. So hard. As time goes on I know transitioning will be harder and easier at the same time. Harder, as puberty makes the changes to your body really hard to reverse. Harder, as my Dysphoria will appear more than it did just a few days ago. But easier, as I'll have more time to process it, to be less scared. But it's hard.

Part 4: Conclusion

Right now I'm thinking ""You're stupid. Why are you posting this? Go die in a hole miserable, this will be too hard for you. What if you're not even a girl? I can't tell, but at the same time, I know I might be slipping into feminine speech patterns. I've been told I switched very often from feminine to masculine speech patterns. One time I was being loud. That was probably when I was subconsciously faking being male. And then when something bad happened, I instinctively was more.. Gentle. Soft. Caring. I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe to prove that I'm trans? That this world won't beat me? Maybe I'm posting this so all of you wonderful people can possibly help me. I don't know. I'm lost, and I need a hand to guide me, but I recoil from that hand. I need softer guidance. Not a hand to guide me, but a rough path to suggest. Maybe a map? Does anybody have a magical map of ""oh god I think I'm trans WHAT DO I DO""? If you do, can I borrow this? Sorry, I'm off on a tangent, aren't I? I don't know. This might (will) get buried and could be ignored for a bit(forever) before anybody says anything. Either that or this will get like 15k upvotes and everybody will hammer me with positivity and give me the energy to say ""Hey, mom, I think I'm trans."" I'm sorry if this is actually the wrong subreddit to do this, if so you can totally just delete this LOL

2020-05-25 01:22:09,gq1nap,12,1,"Lately I've been questioning this because I want to be 110% sure I'm transgender before going on T. I can't get any type of gender therapist at the moment, and most likely won't be able to for a year or more because of family. 

So here's some background. I was born a female, and I've been different ever since I was little. I remember being very curious on why boys were seen as different, because I saw myself as the same. When I look back at myself as a toddler, I regularly got mad at my mom for calling my underwear ""panties"" because panties were for girls, and my brother wore ""underwear"" and I just remember being very angry about it. Whenever I went to the pool I wore swim trunks, and I always took off my shirt. My mom was fine with it until a certain age, in which she would get very angry and tell me I was a girl and girls couldn't do that. It felt unfair, I was just like the boys, and nothing I did MADE me a girl. And as I got older my mom would tell me about puberty. She told me I would get a period and get breasts and I remember just saying ""well that won't happen to ME"" like it couldn't, there was no way. and when my mom gave me training bras I would secretly throw them away, because I knew that I wasn't gonna get boobs it was just obvious. Then of course I did and my feelings towards it didn't change. For my first year or so my periods were very wacky and sometimes I went 3 months without them, making me feel like they'd finally stop like I was just meant to not have them. When I became a teenager I saw celebrities that were, well really hot. And they were women. So I thought I was pretty, but it didn't feel like me. I convinced myself that if I acted more girly I would grow to like it, the same way I liked the celebrities. And I kinda did. But I wasn't feeling myself. It felt like I was being someone else. 

About a year ago I wanna say, I started researching transgender people. I didn't think I was one, but I kept remembering more experiences the more I heard about similar ones. About five months ago I cut my hair off, and over a month found my sense of a masculine style. It felt right. Like I felt more comfortable. Kid's would talk to me on the bus and use he/him pronouns, I passed. It made me feel so good inside. 

I was convinced I was trans, but the more I research the community the more it scares me. I find out about transtrenders (people who believe they are trans but aren't, and I'm also including misdiagnosed trans here because it's getting more common) and detransitioners, who come out as trans and go on hormones and later regret it and go back to their birth gender. 

So even if I feel happier presenting as male, and do want hormones and surgeries in the future, I worry that since my dysphoria isn't as bad as other trans folk I'd turn into one of those people that regrets it after making life altering changes. Like I see a lot of real trans people that say they would kill themselves if they didn't have surgery or hormones, and I don't feel that way. I feel more uncomfortable in a girls body than repulsed. 

So I want to hear what you guys have to say. I want to know if I'm showing the same signs as a trans person or if I seem more like a person who'd regret it. And I wanna know some things I can do to find out if I'm a trender or misdiagnosing myself, because a lot of the online quizes I've found just say ""You're valid UwU"" no matter what answers you choose.",trans,Am I transgender?,1590394929.0,"{'created_utc': 1590369729, 'id': 'gq1nap', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Lately I\'ve been questioning this because I want to be 110% sure I\'m transgender before going on T.

2020-05-25 08:52:57,gq7kkl,2,1," Hi folks,

I'm a recently qualified psychotherapist who identifies as trans and I'm trying to put out some affordable therapy sessions to the communities I want to give back to. I specialise in dealing with depression &amp; anxiety, and am knowledgeable about LGBTQI+ issues. I've had a moderator over at the UK sub verify my identity and qualifications [u/the\_kiriyama](https://www.reddit.com/u/the_kiriyama/) but I thought I'd post here for people in other countries.

A bit about me: I'm a 28 year old guy and live in Newcastle, England with my boyfriend and our rescue dog. I have experience facilitating a transgender support group several years ago, before qualifying as a therapist. I care deeply about making mental healthcare a more accessible service and a more socially acceptable topic of discussion. I'm an integrative therapist, using elements of many types of therapy for a tailor made approach.

If you're interested, I've got some slots available at discounted rates - messaging sessions are $35 for 50-60 minutes and voice chat is $50. Both are conducted over Skype. This is as cheap as I can afford to offer right now (for comparison, a subscription to betterhelp or talkspace with live sessions is about $80 a week), so I really hope it will help some folks!

I also remember reading shortly about studies saying how twins are much more likely to be transgender(both of them) than those who are not.

Then I thought back. I was the second born in my family. I was born approximately 12 months after my brother. Which means it was very close to the previous pregnancy. During pregnancy the mother's hormones is very different, and since imbalanced hormones while the fetus developes is thought to be a transgender cause(not confirmed). I have a theory the reason I might have developed in a way that makes me a transperson, might be because I was exposed to enhightened levels of female hormones. Which would be the result of being so close the previous pregnancy, and that hormone levels might not have gone back completely before the previous pregnancy.

If anyone else here who is transgender share the same experience, of being born closely after your sibling. That might be a sign of my theory being right?

2020-05-25 23:43:26,gqlz6b,0,1,"Hello,

I will post a TLDR for those of you who are in a rush, no stress. I've been going through a lot of mental health things as my children have gotten older. I'm doing the best I can to manage them because I know that I have to realize I am enough. The point of this post is to share that seeing my eldest son, express his feminine (in the most pure six year old sense) has really touched me. We have had a few moments since then that have been met with nothing, but the utmost love. 

I've been in and out of therapy for years for all the things, but what I really needed to talk about. How can someone not be enough? Dysphoria. You all could surely educate me on the subject and that is what I am hoping for by sharing this story. 

So I've been watching my son grow and from the first day he said that he couldn't wait ""for my boobies to grow"" so he could feed his little brother. Super sweet and a moment for a father who doesn't want to see his children struggle as he has. So here is the choice, do I shame this creature I've created that I've loved so much since the day he entered my life or not? There is no way that my child is not enough and if he is, than I am. 

I'm not here to do more than I can, but I can enjoy the positive sides of myself regardless of how society labels them. I asked my wife to paint my accent toes to match her because I like it. She is amazing and has been so supportive of me while I have shared this struggle (as all things are inevitably shared in an intimate relationship). 

I've had a rough week. Having some outpatient surgery really put me out for a loop and my frustration with life manifested itself in a way that meant some really hard conversations had to be had. There will be more, but in the meanwhile all my friends here have my support and I will wear our colors (proudly) for the first time in my life. 

Thanks for reading!!

What as trans people we say this because it is inherently true, you cannot expect to fully understand this cause as a cis person you will never experience what a trans experience is. Kind of like how if a person has cancer you can feel empathetic or understanding of their experience but you will never feel what a cancer patient felt or feels if you yourself have never had cancer and that‚Äôs just the truth.

After conversing a bit more, we finally made that progress and this is what he said


Cis people will never understand how much it bothers trans people to be in the wrong skin/have the wrong identity and we will never know how much it will bother us because we aren't in the wrong skin. We're comfortable and we will never understand just how uncomfortable it is to a trans person, therefore we always tend to undermine the uncomfortable feeling that trans people experience and we don't know just HOW uncomfortable it is.
Which is why we will also never understand dysphoria because that's what that uncomfortable feeling is

And I‚Äôm very proud of him for finally getting that, good ally you deserve a treat cause now you get it that you can‚Äôt get it. Well done!!!

This whole experience made me realize a core reason why cis people don‚Äôt really understand trans people. They expect to know and understand the experience of trans people even though they can never experience trans ness. So when I talk about feeling dysphoric or having sort of trans issue, It‚Äôs hard to relate it to cis people cause they truly cannot relate. They can be understanding sure but you are gonna have to be inadvertently left out cause don‚Äôt know fully.
That‚Äôs where I think a lot of the discrimination stems from this ignorance that you actual believe that you can relate to trans people and act as though since I can‚Äôt relate it to my experience and it‚Äôs not my experience, it is invalid for trans people to feel this way.

We don't speak very often and growing up, there was a lot of emotional neglect and disinterest in knowing me as a person. 

I'm the token queer of the family, but no one knows because I've not allowed them to know the real me, they've never been bothered either. Any time i have expressed myself, it's deemed as 'extreme', a 'phase', a joke. I know it's not good to assume people's reactions, but knowing their expressed opinions on things (yep they're homo + transphobic) and how they've always treated me even up to now, i know it's going to be very difficult to be taken seriously. my mother is especially extremely judgemental.

Even though if any of you met me, it would be plainly obvious I'm not a cishet girl, to them i absolutely am and the mention of anything but is going to be a BIG shock, because they simply haven't paid attention. Because there is such a distance, i think they still see me as i was when i was 17 (closeted af), even though i am vastly different now and v obviously am. People who know ME, find it kinda wild that they have no clue. 

I just don't really know how to approach coming out to them, as a trans person in a queer relationship with another trans person. Like, that's going to be A LOT to them, they're going to see it as something completely out of the blue and if i say I've been hiding it for all these years, they're going to be pissed at me because they have a bit of a victim complex (my mother and grandparents esp).

What's more is i am NOT a confrontational person in the slightest, i hate attention and things being made a big deal, but i KNOW that's what's going to happen. It's really going to hurt so much and I've been putting off from the sheer pain i know it's going to cause me. I am a pretty sensitive person and though they are not people who really deserve to know me and their opinions shouldn't matter, i still want this off my chest and i still care about what they say/think (really wish i didn't).

I just hate that i KNOW they're going to feel betrayed, because basically everyone in my life knows the real me but them and have done for years, plus they'll HATE my name change.

It's been going on for almost 2 years now, we've been seeing a psychiatrist to help me figure out whether I'm actually trans or not (like if I just have some other mental disorder instead of gender dysphoria) and while I'm super grateful that my parents care enough about me to try to get me help, it's all been so much. Like, within the past year I've gone by 3 different names against my will (all supposed to be ""genderfluid"" as my parents put it), I've had to stop binding, my parents have told all my friends I go by a different name, they explicitly discuss my sexual/romantic life with my psychiatrist (in case I'm a lesbian instead of a trans guy), they pat me down to make sure I'm not wearing a binder, my entire family wants me a to be a girl, and I know that if I did turn out to be trans my family would resent me for it. Aside from just my family, I know that I'll never look like a cis male, transitioning is really expensive, being a trans guy is a lot harder than being a cis woman, medically transitioning can have serious health repercussions, and it could be years before I can transition so I'll just be stuck trying to pass as a guy but failing miserably because I can't take hormones. So I guess that leaves me with, should I just give up and live as a girl until I can transition? My psychiatrist says that I should but the problem is that my dysphoria makes just living as a pre-transitioned guy hard enough and I know that it would really make my family happy. I'm so tired, I'm tired of fighting every day to be recognized as a guy by people I know will never accept me, I'm tired of my parents touching and looking at my body in places that make me really uncomfortable, I'm tired of them purposely avoiding pronouns or using feminine pronouns around me, I'm tired of my parents trying to convince me to be a lesbian, I'm tired of them thinking about my sex life, I'm tired of them analyzing everything I say into something that implies that I'm a girl or that I'm sick, I don't want to do this anymore, I've been driven to the point of cutting, smoking, dropping, drinking, trying to run away, overdosing, all that wonderful shit, and at this point, I'm willing to just let them have what they want. I feel so violated and controlled, nowhere feels safe anymore, I'm just done. I'm sorry this post was really ranty, I just don't know what to do anymore.

tl;Dr I'm trans, my family doesn't want me to be, I've been pressured into being a girl again for two years through various methods that have nearly pushed me to suicide multiple times, should I just give up and be a girl until I can move out.",trans,Should I go back to being a girl until I can leave my house?,1590598284.0,"{'created_utc': 1590573084, 'id': 'grgs88', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I\'m a trans guy (15y/o) and I\'ve been out for 4 years, but more recently my parents have been pushing for me to detransition and be a girl again. It\'s been going on for almost 2 years now, we\'ve been seeing a psychiatrist to help me figure out whether I\'m actually trans or not (like if I just have some other mental disorder instead of gender dysphoria) and while I\'m super grateful that my parents care enough about me to try to get me help, it\'s all been so much. Like, within the past year I\'ve gone by 3 different names against my will (all supposed to be ""genderfluid"" as my parents put it), I\'ve had to stop binding, my parents have told all my friends I go by a different name, they explicitly discuss my sexual/romantic life with my psychiatrist (in case I\'m a lesbian instead of a trans guy), they pat me down to make sure I\'m not wearing a binder, my entire family wants me a to be a girl, and I know that if I did turn out to be trans my family would resent me for it. Aside from just my family, I know that I\'ll never look like a cis male, transitioning is really expensive, being a trans guy is a lot harder than being a cis woman, medically transitioning can have serious health repercussions, and it could be years before I can transition so I\'ll just be stuck trying to pass as a guy but failing miserably because I can\'t take hormones. So I guess that leaves me with, should I just give up and live as a girl until I can transition? My psychiatrist says that I should but the problem is that my dysphoria makes just living as a pre-transitioned guy hard enough and I know that it would really make my family happy. I\'m so tired, I\'m tired of fighting every day to be recognized as a guy by people I know will never accept me, I\'m tired of my parents touching and looking at my body in places that make me really uncomfortable, I\'m tired of them purposely avoiding pronouns or using feminine pronouns around me, I\'m tired of my parents trying to convince me to be a lesbian, I\'m tired of them thinking about my sex life, I\'m tired of them analyzing everything I say into something that implies that I\'m a girl or that I\'m sick, I don\'t want to do this anymore, I\'ve been driven to the point of cutting, smoking, dropping, drinking, trying to run away, overdosing, all that wonderful shit, and at this point, I\'m willing to just let them have what they want.

I'm very attracted to the feminine physique. I am also very attracted to the D. 

While I can be temporarily sexually attract to a man in the moment, I lose interest when the moment passes and I have no interest in a romantic relationship with a man. 

So thus I find the idea of dating a transwoman very appealing. It isn't a fetish or a bucket list item. But I worry about it coming off as that; I don't want to send the wrong impression or trigger some poor girl who has had lots of reasons to be triggered through what must be an unimaginably difficult journey. 

I also wonder about dysphoria. Are most transgirls dysphoric? Are they going to be turned off if I'm interested in their male genitalia?

I currently identify as a straight cisgender male however I have been an ally since I found out about this all of this stuff, I have never seen what made any of this so wrong, and while I admittedly have made a helicopter joke atleast 1 time back when that was popular, I have never had any problem with trans people. Something about them just clicked with me, and I felt like I related to them. I had always had thoughts about what it would be like to be a girl, but I always thought that was just a normal thing, and I still don't necessarily think that it isn't. What I have recently learned is not normal, however, is thinking about it as much as I do. Now, I have never actually had problems with being a boy, I haven't ever felt like I hated my body, nor have I ever felt like I hated my identity. I could very well live out the rest of my life as a man with no issues. Infact, even if I am mtf trans, it would be fairly easy for me as my family is very accepting, and honestly im not sure if transitioning would even be needed because really the issue for me is on the inside and self assurance, I honestly don't even care about my own pronouns. My whole thing was basically that I was a cis male and am perfectly fine being such, but if I got to choose how I would be born i would be a girl. I just thought for certain I was just a confused cis. Until literally just earlier today. I was browsing r/egg_irl (I know very cis thing to do haha) and in the replies of some meme I saw something saying ""I am trans, but I'm still okay with my assigned gender"" or something like that. This blew my mind. I had paid alot of attention to the trans community but I only really heard stories from YouTubers and people I follow on Twitter. I had always assumed that to be trans you had to hate your assigned gender or something, but just this one comment on a meme changed everything. I almost immediately went to this subreddit and look for similar stories, and to my surprise there were a good amount of atleast similar ones. So now I'm here. The best way to describe me is that I probably wouldn't transition, but if a damn magical gorilla offered me a banana that would turn me into a girl, I would take it. But I have seen people describe it in similar ways and use it for both as why they aren't trans or as why they aren't. Honestly, the whole reason I am asking this right now is because I need closure. I am unable to convince myself one way or the other and honestly just someone saying ""u r train"" or ""u r sis"" would do a whole lot to help.

TLDR I am perfectly okay and happy as a guy but I would rather be a girl but not by that much and I have no idea if I am trans or not.

Honestly it's so hard to find any real porn that has trans people in it. Almost all I can find is basicaly just stuff made by creepy chasers that use derogatory terms, or a few people who say there trans girl in some titles and then have other titles that are transphobic to themself. 

I really wish there was porn made by trans girls for trans girls. 

Also almost any trans porn is just offensive inaccurate depictions of trans women. It's never realistic its alwase catering to chasers or creepy cis het men. Theres also a large lack of trans men or any nonbinary people. I really hope that one day there is an abundance of well made non offensive realistic and diverse trans porn made by trans people for trans people or non trans people.

Also I understand some people want to use offensive terms for themselves for whatever reason but it plays into what chasers want and its transphobic. Using trans specific degrading language hurts how trans people are treated becaue we are seen as sex objects and specifically an obscure fetish. 

Things are getting better in general alot of media but all I ever see is the same offensive porn and it makes me sad.

I want to see a trans girl who dosent use any self degrading language who calls their body what they want to call it and does things on their terms. For example honestly personaly i dont want to refer to my genitals in any way and I dont need to do so.

I just want to see a trans girl sitting at home and doing whatever they do in a video and have the title not be offensive and have them not say language that triggers me to have a shitty dysphoric time reading the title or whatever.

Hello, Reddit! Basically I wanted to know if there was a name for what I'm feeling. I am biologically female and have had this experience for around 4-5 years, and before but I didn't know the names for it. Originally I thought I was a trans man, I had body, voice and social dysphoria ever since primary school (Aussie) but recently my feelings have changed. I have always preferred male pronouns, he/him/himself etc. I have always wanted male titles, I wanted to be a dad, father, husband etc. not a mother, not a wife, not a girlfriend. It sounds perfect, right? nope. Originally I hated female clothing, but recently I've realised something new. I want to be cute, I like feminine clothes and I want to twirl and dance. I like being called a male but I fear if I transition I'll be forced into toxic masculinity. I've never considered myself nonbinary. I have nothing against it, I just never thought it was possible. I wanted to know if anyone knew what I could be called.

TLDR: Prefer male titles, but like feminine clothes, don't wanna lose sense of style after transition.

So, I'm a nonbianary AFAB.  I use they/them pronouns and go by a masculine name.  This past week I had a stroke.  I'm in my mid 20's.  Something like this should not be happening to me, but that's life.

I'm not planning on changing my legal name until my partner and I get married next year, as their last name has more significance to me than my own.  When I need to use my legal name for something, I always add that I don't use that name and give my real name.

While in the hospital, a nurse asked about any cultural needs I have, and my partner chimed in with ""They're trans and use they/them pronouns.  They also use the name [name]""

This nurse looks at me, laughs, and says ""That's not really a cultural thing MISS [DEADNAME], I was looking for something like if you need to eat facing the north""  She then turns to my parter and talks about treatments I'll need while constantly refering to me as she and her.  We didn't bother correcting any other staff because I get genuinely angry when people who know that I'm trans misgender me, but only mildly uncomfortable when people misgender me because they are unaware.  Anger after a stroke is not a great thing.



Fast forward to last night, my first night back home, and I log into this fitness app I've been using.  It's through my insurance as it's somehow a medical service so I have to use my legal name when in a group session.  My trainer says ""I would like to be respectful of people's names, so if any one has a specific pronunciation or a nick name, please let me know""

I chime in that I go by [name].  Someone mentions that that can't be a nickname since it's a man's name and so different from my own.  So I out myself as trans and the trainer literally says ""I'm not really sure if I understand what you're trying to say MISS [DEADNAME]"" So I just left the session and sent a long ass email about how I don't feel like this is an inclusive environment and I asked for a refund for the past 4 sessions and the remainder of the course, which is 6 months.  I haven't heard back from customer service, but I'm pretty upset and needed to rant before I have another stroke.",trans,A rant about the medical field,1590801660.0,"{'created_utc': 1590776460, 'id': 'gsy8mc', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'TW for misgendering\n\n\n\nSo, I\'m a nonbianary AFAB.

It goes by a few titles but it‚Äôs best described as depersonalization; it‚Äôs a symptom of a few different issues but is a fairly common one with gender dysphoria. It causes you to feel separate and partially numb to the rest of the world, you feel like you‚Äôre in third person for your own life. You faintly feel what you should feel in day-to-day situations but even when in extreme situations you still only faintly feel any emotions. But it seems unrelated to you and you do what you think you should do and react how you think you should react and act on what numb and faint feelings you have. But you still feel detached from it all, as if it‚Äôs not real and you‚Äôre just watching it happen. It fills you with an emptiness and an indescribable pit of nothingness that never goes away. Even something that everybody does like crying takes a substantial amount of effort and you feel like you‚Äôre just putting on an act whenever you do it. It can be pretty hard to cry or even impossible but when you do actually cry it‚Äôs as if everything is just draining out of you and for hours or days afterwards you feel even more numb and as if crying took all the effort you could put up. If I‚Äôm being honest I thought everybody felt like this and just did what was expected because it was right, I didn‚Äôt know there was anything wrong or weird about not feeling things and just acting as you thought you should, and when I found out that wasn‚Äôt normal I didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with me.

TW: suicide, depression

I am a transmasculine individual. I used to identify as fully male. I started exploring my gender in 8th grade. 

However, I fell in love with a straight boy at that time. We started out as best friends, and pretty soon we were inseparable. My mom always said it was obvious how much he loved me. We were always cuddling, it was an innocent relationship for the most part (ok, we made out a lot, so not that innocent).

We were still best friends throughout our relationship. We watched movies, played cards against humanity, went to amusement parks together, skied together, and played with stuffed animals. But most importantly, we confided in each other.

About 3 months into our relationship, I told him I was trans. He said he would love me no matter what. Then, I brought up hormones, and he just went completely silent. He didn't talk to me after that.

I'd never been more hurt in my entire life. I became suicidal afterwards, which I know isn't normal. But those feelings never went away.

At the beginning of sophomore year (this year), he became friends with me again. He even began petting my hair, which should have made me happy but I broke down because the emotions of being close to him were too much. He avoided physical contact with me after that, which just made me even more depressed.

I came out as non-binary in January.

In March, he reached out to me, we got close again, and we dated over facetime (social distancing) for a week, before he said that our first breakup had caused him to be scared of commitment. We had a fight, I said some shitty things, we went back to pretty much no talking.

Now, it's been two years since our first breakup, two months since our second, and I've been in agony. I can't stop crying. I've come close to attempting suicide several times this week.

Nobody in my life understands me. Even my therapist has no clue how to help me. I've tried looking up advice but no one's been in my situation before. I don't even know why I feel so fucking sad.

He avoided physical contact with me after that, which just made me even more depressed.\n\nI came out as non-binary in January.\n\nIn March, he reached out to me, we got close again, and we dated over facetime (social distancing) for a week, before he said that our first breakup had caused him to be scared of commitment. We had a fight, I said some shitty things, we went back to pretty much no talking.\n\nNow, it's been two years since our first breakup, two months since our second, and I've been in agony. I can't stop crying. I've come close to attempting suicide several times this week.\n\nNobody in my life understands me. Even my therapist has no clue how to help me. I've tried looking up advice but no one's been in my situation before. I don't even know why I feel so fucking sad. I need someone to understand.

Either way, I'd like to spend some time long weekend or even a week down in the city, to have some free time as Ally without the additional stress of wondering who I am going yo bump into.

Wondering if any of you have any suggestions regarding good locations/accommodations where a girl like me could spend a few days in close proximity to some night life and good eats.  Trying to figure a place that won't require a ton of work/time to get around.  

I'd like to find myself in a more lgbqt friendly area, though I here much of the city is pretty care free in that regard, just a preference, not an absolute.  

Would love suggestions or places to stay and nightlife.  I seem to see some ""trans"" events at bars, but not sure what to expect.  Would love to hear more regarding the trans related events and what to expect if anyone has any experience on that end as well.  Wondering if they are more like a bar/club setting or if its more of an ""escort"" type of setting.

2020-05-30 06:31:33,gt9k01,4,1,"Hi all,

I am writing to share my story about gender and see if anyone else has a similar story or any advice. I've felt that I want to be male for the past decade (I'm 23 now). However, I didn't grow up always ""knowing"" that I was trans-- I lived a very stereotypically female childhood and never experienced dysphoria about it. Puberty changed that for me. Unfortunately, I worry that wanting to be male is not the same as really feeling like I AM male/am simply in the wrong body. I worry that my dysphoria stems from internalized sexism and that even if I were to transition, I would still not be male ""enough"" to satisfy myself (ex: still short, bottom surgery options insufficient, likely still feminine facial features/might not pass).

Because of these concerns, I decided a few years ago that it was the right path for me to not transition, and to instead focus on accepting my body for what it is. For a short while, that worked-- I found a partner who made me feel comfortable as myself and I stayed busy with school and other activities. However, when I am alone at night, overthinking everything and wishing for things that I cannot have,  the dysphoria comes back no weaker than before.

I know it's quite a few years off, but the thought of my body changing in the ways necessary for pregnancy FREAKS me  out and I am SO scared that I will hate my body and that I will resent my child and my choice to become a biological parent.

Has anything in particular helped alleviate dysphoria? If AFAB, have you had biological children/how has that been?

I\'ve felt that I want to be male for the past decade (I\'m 23 now). However, I didn\'t grow up always ""knowing"" that I was trans-- I lived a very stereotypically female childhood and never experienced dysphoria about it. Puberty changed that for me. Unfortunately, I worry that wanting to be male is not the same as really feeling like I AM male/am simply in the wrong body. I worry that my dysphoria stems from internalized sexism and that even if I were to transition, I would still not be male ""enough"" to satisfy myself (ex: still short, bottom surgery options insufficient, likely still feminine facial features/might not pass).\n\nBecause of these concerns, I decided a few years ago that it was the right path for me to not transition, and to instead focus on accepting my body for what it is.

2020-05-30 18:34:29,gtj81h,0,1,"Hello. I‚Äôm making a reddit post about this because I‚Äôm too anxious to talk to the people around me about it.

For about as long as I can remember, part of me has always thought I was supposed to be born a girl. When I was younger, like around the age of 5-6. I would look heavily into female anatomy. I‚Äôd play dress up with my mom and try on some of her bras. And I would do little kid ‚Äúmagic‚Äù stuff to try and make my member disappear. I had like a moment of realization when I first when into kindergarten that these thoughts and actions I had weren‚Äôt very normal. So I did my best to suppress them, and they went away. That is, until about 7th grade.

7th grade is when those thoughts I had as a kid came back, and they came back really, really hard. I felt jealous that my friends that were girls had so many options when it came to clothing, and they could look so pretty. I became insecure of my own body and when I went to the beach, I would often wear swim shirts to cover up my upper body. I started wearing as gender neutral clothes as I could, with jeans and hoodies pretty much all the time. It was terrible, and this is when I first started to notice I had severe depression as well.

I‚Äôm currently 18, just graduated high school, and the thoughts are probably at their peak. They have come and gone frequently since 7th grade, and they get gradually more intense each time. I‚Äôm afraid to even admit these thoughts to most of my friends, because to me it worries me that they could feel betrayed, ya know? They‚Äôve know the me as I‚Äôve been for years, and they‚Äôve never know about all of these thoughts in my head that eat away at me fairly often. I worry about my friends and family looking at me differently. I usually try to be in a romantic relationship with a girl as much as I can be, since I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic and it usually helps the thoughts go away. But they do come and go throughout my relationships, and it makes me worry if I‚Äôm just touch starved or something. What would my girlfriend think of me if she knew I had these thoughts? Part of me wants to dress cutely, be cute and stuff, and the other half of me says that‚Äôs wrong and I shouldn‚Äôt feel that way. I worry that the thoughts I have will mess up my future somehow, and I‚Äôm terrified of using female pronouns at all. 

I‚Äôm just in a major dilemma and I needed someone to talk to about it. Do I have gender dysphoria, and am I transgender? I feel like I already know the answer to this, but at the same time I‚Äôm not sure. I can‚Äôt get therapy about this because my parents are extremely right wing, and because of quarantine.

Mum's afraid that me transitioning will scare the rest of the family, ruin their image and make life harder for everyone. Dad thinks all transgenders are simply incorrectly dealing with deep-rooted  trauma - and considering I'm a host of an undiagnosed OSDD-1b System, I know what Trauma has truly done to our mind.

Mum MAJORLY freaked out when she saw I named half of my socks my preferred name and Dad took me on an entire day-long drive to try and convince me that I was jumping to conclusions and it made me feel even more depressed, despite the fact he kept reminding me that he was still supportive of my journey.

Regardless, my uni psychologist is legit supportive and helped me setup a meeting with a gender-affirming psychologist - keen to meet them - so I'm not gonna stop for their fear of having to accept my less 'traditional' identity \[despite there being Transgenders for centuries, it's not considered to be a long time thing by these peeps\]

paint your toenails!  

shaving of course.  i like to use a disposable women's razor.  instead of shaving cream, i use ""sleek and shine"" conditioner from Garnier, and shave in 1 or 2 different directions.  this gets me ULTRA smooth

you can also clean up the cuticles on your fingernails (a cuticle pusher tool is like $0.99 at a drug store), and use a matte clear coat that isn't noticable (but you'll feel it)

work on a skin care routine -- mine is cheap and simple, i just spray my whole body with witchhazel + a smidge of isopropyl (this is basically for aftershave/rash prevention on shabing days) and then rub down with baby oil after the witchhazel mix is semi-dry

hair care routine is a great addition too!  i use a mix of 90% conditioner and 10% shampoo most days, and only use all shampoo about every 2-3 days.  my hair gets tangled so for me, detangler is a must.  if you need it, you should be able to find it in a ""neutral"" scent like apples

i also pluck all the facial hair out of my mustache, beard, and sideburns to avoid the dreaded beard shadow.  that sounds painful and tedious, but i swear to you the second time is soooooo much easier and faster (if you do this every day, you can get by with only 15 or 20 minutes of effort, because it all comes back slowly). you can clean up your eyebrows at the same time, if you are inclined",trans,for all my closeted AMAB sisters and siblings: affirmation!,1590940326.0,"{'created_utc': 1590915126, 'id': 'gtvmzf', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'i find myself making this post often, so here are some things you can do to affirm your gender and alleviate dysphoria, without alerting those around you!  bonus: i am poor as dirt so i assume you are, too!\n\npaint your toenails!  \n\nshaving of course.  i like to use a disposable women\'s razor.  instead of shaving cream, i use ""sleek and shine"" conditioner from Garnier, and shave in 1 or 2 different directions.  this gets me ULTRA smooth\n\nyou can also clean up the cuticles on your fingernails (a cuticle pusher tool is like $0.99 at a drug store), and use a matte clear coat that isn\'t noticable (but you\'ll feel it)\n\nwork on a skin care routine -- mine is cheap and simple, i just spray my whole body with witchhazel + a smidge of isopropyl (this is basically for aftershave/rash prevention on shabing days) and then rub down with baby oil after the witchhazel mix is semi-dry\n\nhair care routine is a great addition too!  i use a mix of 90% conditioner and 10% shampoo most days, and only use all shampoo about every 2-3 days.  my hair gets tangled so for me, detangler is a must.  if you need it, you should be able to find it in a ""neutral"" scent like apples\n\ni also pluck all the facial hair out of my mustache, beard, and sideburns to avoid the dreaded beard shadow.  that sounds painful and tedious, but i swear to you the second time is soooooo much easier and faster (if you do this every day, you can get by with only 15 or 20 minutes of effort, because it all comes back slowly). you can clean up your eyebrows at the same time, if you are inclined', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'for all my closeted AMAB sisters and siblings: affirmation!', 'created': 1590940326.0}"

2020-05-31 22:13:09,gu85t6,4,1,"Hello. I‚Äôm 20, when I was 13 I came out as FTM &amp; was met with my family making fun of me, calling me ‚Äúit‚Äù and other belittling words. My step father is disgusted with gay people, but my mother actually followed me to pride last year and is alright with the LGBT community, she referred to herself as bi many years ago... 
I was very depressed around the time I came out, and started going to therapy, however, with time passing and being ridiculed so much, I gave in and started to try reverting back... I grew my hair back out, started trying to fit in as much as possible.
From 14-18 ish I wore makeup, feminine clothing more often, had longer hair each year... And I started to realize that I don‚Äôt have to have short hair. I love my long hair now, I love some girly clothing &amp; see such pretty guys rocking the same thing. I‚Äôm still trans. I‚Äôm still figuring things out. 
What‚Äôs keeping me from transitioning or seeking help to start my journey is the fear of disappointing everyone around me, becoming the new hot gossip in our old village. I don‚Äôt want the attention, I just want to keep living like I am. Besides not having the body I want, being stuck in a body I resent and don‚Äôt feel attached to, I‚Äôm living my dream. 
I‚Äôm not quite sure if I‚Äôm a trans male or non-binary, I‚Äôve always been male at heart, but can‚Äôt say I relate to either male or female, I‚Äôm aware I can figure it out with time.

My family knows I‚Äôm into women and that I‚Äôm bisexual. I was vocal about a female crush I had when we were out on vacation once... It became a bit of a joke (and not a belittling one.)
They know I have a friend who is trans &amp; haven‚Äôt made any rude remarks about that.
My mother even helped me buy a binder when I was 13. She wasn‚Äôt exactly thrilled, but I was thankful.

Thankfully, there are a few things that help me.
I‚Äôve always dressed (besides that feminine ish phase) tom-boy ish. Band shirts, track suits, black sweatpants, and so forth. Just comfortable. I get away with that. I have very supportive friends &amp; will be moving back out of my family home when this corona deal is over.
(TMI) I don‚Äôt get my period at all anymore, thanks to birth control and I have naturally smaller breasts. It helps a bunch with the dysphoria, given that I don‚Äôt see the lumps with my t-shirts.

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm almost there, at my goal, but it feels so so far away...

Are there any Swedes here that know whether top surgery and T are available as a non-binary person? I read up a bit, but got confused.

I need support, tips and tricks...
