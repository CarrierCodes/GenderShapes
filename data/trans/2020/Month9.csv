She barely leaves the house because of dysphoria, she uses soap and razor to remove the bodyhair, which  f\*\*ks with her skin. We are saving money for a permanent removal, but as you know, this is expensive and will take time.

I'm fine with this, but it complicated things after having been on HRT for 18 months. :/ Thanks to YouTube, I was led to believe that estrogen eventually causes permanent sterility. Thankfully this seems not to be the case.

Today I had a long talk with my endo, and she said that stopping estrogen typically results in returning to your original fertility levels. Some AMAB transgender people may have been infertile before starting HRT, but never knew they were because they never got tested. (Low fertility may be more common among trans people, since we're slightly more likely to have had unusual hormone levels for our AGAB to begin with.)

This has been a big relief. It means that it doesn't much matter whether I pause HRT now or in five years; we'll have a chance to have kids even if we can't afford banking. 😊 And it also means I can enjoy continued HRT and living as myself without so much fear of what to do in the future!! ❤️

My girlfriend has her 10 year anniversary of transitioning next year. I want to throw her a little celebration, with my close family and our friends. I've already got the ok from her, as I wasn't sure how she'd feel about her transition being the centre of attention, as she doesn't make it public knowledge.

So I'm really excited about this, but I don't know what to do for it! I'm thinking a nice meal out, some drinks and games. I also want to get a gift that can symbolise both my love for her, but also how far she's come.

But I really need suggestions! Even if it's something as small as somewhere to get napkins. We're in the UK, in case that info is needed. I'd especially love suggestions on what gift I could get, maybe jewellery? We're also crazy cat ladies, so anything cat themed will get extra points.

She's no contact with her family, so I can't get any pictures from before we met 4 years ago or anything like that.

I don't know if this is something many people do, but I couldn't not do something for her. I'm so proud of her and she needs something good like this.

• Were you raised in a Christian house?
• Do you still follow the christian faith?
• How old were you when you realized you were trans?

On 20200821 I sent off my paperwork to both Social Security, and TX DSHS - Vital Statistics.  
____

First, Social Security.  
Offices are closed for covid, so I had to mail it.  
I sent a completed [SS-5](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf), a certified copy of the name change, my physician letter in a format complaint with SS and State Dept. [SSA-POMS reference with example wording](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0110212200).  
[State Dept](https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040303.html)  
[Trans Equality has it as an editable form.](https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/passports) It must be on your doctors letter head.  
Also, my letter references my full legal name and DOB at time the letter was written, this is necessary for some places to accept it.   
It also has the doctors DEA # listed after the license #.  
And finally I also put my old SS card in.

Yesterday, I received a letter from my local SS office on 20200902 with all my documents back and a document stating that my new card will arrive within two weeks.  

Today, 20200903, I received my new SS card with correct name.
____

Now, Texas DSHS Vital Statistics.  
I sent a completed [VS-170](https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/reqproc/Amendment_Birth_Form_2019-(003).pdf), a certified copy of the name change order, a copy of my license, and a cashiers check for the fees $60.

It was $60 because I order it  expedited. The address for sending expedited requests is missing the ZIP on the form, its 78756.  
[this page](https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/reqproc/amendment.shtm) has all the info  

In section one I used my new name, and signed with my new signature on section six.  
This signature was notarized at the bank the same time I had them change all my stuff there.

In section three, at the bottom, there is a place where you MUST check the box for a new certificate to be created instead of just adding an amendment to the old one. THERE IS NO BOX, LMAOWTFBBQ.  
I put a big X where it looks like the box should be.

On 20200826 DSHS cashed the check.

Yesterday 20200902, I received a phone call from a ""processing specialist"" at DSHS ""Paternity | Vital Statistics Section"".  
She said they needed my parents birth dates for the new certificate, she asked that I respond with the missing information to an email she had just sent.  
Parents birth dates weren't recorded when I was born, so they didn't have that data.  
I sent the email, she responded that the new record is complete, it has to be printed and should ship in a couple days.  
So I'm expecting that next week.  
____

I have an appointment with the DMV in a couple weeks.  
____

I have blank copies of the petition and order I used to get my gender changed as a non-native to MT, and now confirmed to work at least once to get Texas to update a birth certificate as a non-resident, they are in the link below.

Ok so today was my birthday. I know nothing special comes every year but this one was a little different, it's the first birthday since I finished coming out to everyone in my family. So of course I was preparing myself for the usual bombardment of cards with my dead name on.......but then my grandma handed me a card that just had an initial on the front. So I'm interaged of course how could I not be and I open it to find a beautiful hand made card (no surprise that's kinda my grandmas thing) and on the inside is my name......not my dead name my name the one I chose and the words to an awsome granddaughter many happy returns. So I burst into tears obviously and my grandma bless her soul looks horrified thinking she has done something wrong. So too cut s long story short after about 20 minutes of me reassuring her that she hadn't and they where tears of joy I opened the rest of the cards and they all had my chosen name and correct genderd turmanology in (daughter/granddaughter/niease ect.) Apart from one from those who shall not be named that I have tucked at the very back out of sight. 

So in summary my family is awsome and I'm kinda high on gender euphoria right now.

Is it normal for me to feel strange and somewhat guilty when others use my preferred name and pronouns? 

I ask because whenever I’m with people who use my preferred name and pronouns I start to feel as though I’m lying to myself and that they’re just being kind. 


It’s only with people who used to know me before I came out and began using a new name and pronouns, but with people who I’ve just newly met I don’t have that feeling, and typically I get a sense of euphoria from it. It also doesn’t happen when I’m talking to these people online or over the phone, only in person.



I think it may stem from the fact that I find it hard to pick out things about myself that are feminine (I’m 6’2”, have a bass tone voice, get very thick body and facial hair that always comes back very fast, etc.)

So I've been talking with a therapist for a few months and I'm basically at the stage where I'm deciding what I should do. I do have gender dysphoria but according to my therapist I'm slightly more of a unique case. She told me that most trans people believe they are a female born in the wrong body. While in my case its more of an overwhelming desire wishing that I was a female. I've been close to the point of suicide for a bit because of it but right now I'm pretty fine with my life. I've tried giving up the desire before but it seems to always come back. I've tried committing to saying that I'll transition but I doubt myself. I'm just really stuck in this thing of not knowing anything. She told me to try and ask some people who have transitioned some questions/doubts to help figure things out.

Some of the doubts I have are:

Idealizing the female life (thinking that it'll fix my anxiety, depression, social life, insecurities, etc.)

Thinking that maybe this is just some sexual fetish

I could just be lacking attention and think that if I were a female people would care about me

Since the desire fluctuates and spikes a lot maybe its just a thing to comfort myself

Worried about how I'll look as in my daydreams I'm a short cute girl, but in real life I'm 5'8 and have a huge bone structure w/ a bulky build (I weight lifted a lot when I was competing in swim). Despite this bulky build my ribs still jut out of my stomach and chest so you know. I already hate how I look even though if I look at myself objectively I'm pretty average, but if I were to transition and become an abomination...

Maybe because this is something I can't actually have since I personally view transgender as a ""good enough solution"" since you can't really change biology, I think that it actually won't be good enough. They say humans always want what they can't have so maybe that is what this is.

Sometimes I feel like maybe I just think that life will be better if I were a girl because my sisters were spoiled while I was extremely neglected.

I've kinda faked being a guy to the point where it feels natural so if this happened maybe it was just a phase or something.

I feel like at this point that wanting to be a girl could be a habit and no longer that actual desire since on a few occasions I catch myself forcing myself to do/think something because it is something I would do if I were a girl (forcing myself to do things to validate that the desire isn't fake?) Also feel like I skew memories to be like yeah this happened because I wanted to do girly things or something, when maybe in reality it was just because of some other reason.

Maybe I'm just delusional

If I could live a normal life without experiencing this I would choose that in a heartbeat, but also if I could choose being born a girl or boy I would 100% choose a girl. Almost every trans person I've seen on the internet say they wouldn't trade being trans for anything but I honestly would rather just life a normal life.

The one question about having hrt on an abandoned island and if you would do it. I honestly wouldn't because then is there really a point. Apparently most people how transitioned said yes.

I do have gender dysphoria but according to my therapist I\'m slightly more of a unique case. She told me that most trans people believe they are a female born in the wrong body. While in my case its more of an overwhelming desire wishing that I was a female. I\'ve been close to the point of suicide for a bit because of it but right now I\'m pretty fine with my life. I\'ve tried giving up the desire before but it seems to always come back. I\'ve tried committing to saying that I\'ll transition but I doubt myself. I\'m just really stuck in this thing of not knowing anything. She told me to try and ask some people who have transitioned some questions/doubts to help figure things out.\n\nSome of the doubts I have are:\n\nIdealizing the female life (thinking that it\'ll fix my anxiety, depression, social life, insecurities, etc.)\n\nThinking that maybe this is just some sexual fetish\n\nI could just be lacking attention and think that if I were a female people would care about me\n\nSince the desire fluctuates and spikes a lot maybe its just a thing to comfort myself\n\nWorried about how I\'ll look as in my daydreams I\'m a short cute girl, but in real life I\'m 5\'8 and have a huge bone structure w/ a bulky build (I weight lifted a lot when I was competing in swim). Despite this bulky build my ribs still jut out of my stomach and chest so you know. I already hate how I look even though if I look at myself objectively I\'m pretty average, but if I were to transition and become an abomination...\n\nMaybe because this is something I can\'t actually have since I personally view transgender as a ""good enough solution"" since you can\'t really change biology, I think that it actually won\'t be good enough. They say humans always want what they can\'t have so maybe that is what this is.\n\nSometimes I feel like maybe I just think that life will be better if I were a girl because my sisters were spoiled while I was extremely neglected.\n\nI\'ve kinda faked being a guy to the point where it feels natural so if this happened maybe it was just a phase or something.\n\nI feel like at this point that wanting to be a girl could be a habit and no longer that actual desire since on a few occasions I catch myself forcing myself to do/think something because it is something I would do if I were a girl (forcing myself to do things to validate that the desire isn\'t fake?)

2020-09-05 21:57:48,in9wtv,0,1,"Good evening.   
As some of you remember, I postet a story ""Him, Stefany"".  There was a close friend of me who tried outing, but since he (male pronoun is intentional) did not ever show his true self and you would never see him female outside. A normal male.. But the story is not about him.  
We recently broke up and I am feeling a bit bad. Stefany does not know one thing: He was talking all the time to a (maybe) trans, me. Not maybe, I think I am a girl.

I have a complete male body and am bulky, almost fat. My facial hair is growing very fast, I could shave every day but I hate it. And there is also that damn thing between my legs and of course my bodyhair. I have never talked about it to anyone except another friend of mine but we dont talk much and she struggles with her own stuff so I leave her alone, so you have the pleasure to wittness my ""outing"" ever.  
I had a set of female clothing in my secret drawer but when I moved to my new home a few years ago. But before our friends encountered it while we were carrying my stuff,  I had to get rid of them as ""Garbage"" and lost my first set. It was a skirt, some shirts, a pair of stockings and some thights. It was the savest thing to do before anyone else encountered my true identity. I am planning to move again next year and I will buy new clothing when I get there but need to hide it just in case something happens.   
With all this I also had my Facebook profile  for my female (now deleted) self as well as being logged in an online browsergame as a female. Most importantly I have got to know a few people who I am still chatting with today. They think I am a woman but they will not know who I really am.

The worst part of it is a guy who seemingly fell in love with me. I do not know how but it has been 2 years now and he is confessing me ever and ever again. He even wanted to call me on my ""fake"" birthday but I refused. He shall NOT hear my male voice no matter what. Of course everytime the topic comes up he is heartbroken. I do not toy with him, this is not what I want, I do not love him.  
I do not know how to deal with him. I am too scared to confess and I dont want it.

The other girl never questioned me about myself, I am happy because early at fb I had a ""fb""-friend who always asked me about menstruation.. how the hell was I supposed to answer her? I just googled it because I was scared.

Come out to everyone.. I have been asked that by this another friend of mine but I cant. I am a descendant of a very strict conservative family, where any of this stuff is seen as bad (okay, my parents know that I dont mind LGBT people and they are cool with it) but you shall not be gay or what ever. Please do not blame them, I am still one of the kind who supports the 2-genders-theory (Man is man, woman is woman, transpeople can choose their side in one of them). I can explain that in an extra post but it is my personal believe and please respect it (I wouldnt be here if I hated you lol).  
My friends are also conservative or just dont mind this stuff but I will never dare to watch them see me come out! NEVER EVER. Work and school/courses are not the people I would come out too, not trust worthy for me.

So this is me. A trans in male body, refusing to undergo surgery and HRT... but wanna be girl

There was a close friend of me who tried outing, but since he (male pronoun is intentional) did not ever show his true self and you would never see him female outside. A normal male.. But the story is not about him.  \nWe recently broke up and I am feeling a bit bad. Stefany does not know one thing: He was talking all the time to a (maybe) trans, me. Not maybe, I think I am a girl.\n\nI have a complete male body and am bulky, almost fat. My facial hair is growing very fast, I could shave every day but I hate it. And there is also that damn thing between my legs and of course my bodyhair. I have never talked about it to anyone except another friend of mine but we dont talk much and she struggles with her own stuff so I leave her alone, so you have the pleasure to wittness my ""outing"" ever.  \nI had a set of female clothing in my secret drawer but when I moved to my new home a few years ago. But before our friends encountered it while we were carrying my stuff,  I had to get rid of them as ""Garbage"" and lost my first set. It was a skirt, some shirts, a pair of stockings and some thights. It was the savest thing to do before anyone else encountered my true identity. I am planning to move again next year and I will buy new clothing when I get there but need to hide it just in case something happens.   \nWith all this I also had my Facebook profile  for my female (now deleted) self as well as being logged in an online browsergame as a female. Most importantly I have got to know a few people who I am still chatting with today. They think I am a woman but they will not know who I really am.\n\nThe worst part of it is a guy who seemingly fell in love with me. I do not know how but it has been 2 years now and he is confessing me ever and ever again. He even wanted to call me on my ""fake"" birthday but I refused. He shall NOT hear my male voice no matter what. Of course everytime the topic comes up he is heartbroken. I do not toy with him, this is not what I want, I do not love him.  \nI do not know how to deal with him. I am too scared to confess and I dont want it.\n\nThe other girl never questioned me about myself, I am happy because early at fb I had a ""fb""-friend who always asked me about menstruation.. how the hell was I supposed to answer her? I just googled it because I was scared.\n\nCome out to everyone.. I have been asked that by this another friend of mine but I cant. I am a descendant of a very strict conservative family, where any of this stuff is seen as bad (okay, my parents know that I dont mind LGBT people and they are cool with it) but you shall not be gay or what ever. Please do not blame them, I am still one of the kind who supports the 2-genders-theory (Man is man, woman is woman, transpeople can choose their side in one of them). I can explain that in an extra post but it is my personal believe and please respect it (I wouldnt be here if I hated you lol).  \nMy friends are also conservative or just dont mind this stuff but I will never dare to watch them see me come out! NEVER EVER. Work and school/courses are not the people I would come out too, not trust worthy for me.\n\nSo this is me.

As the pandemic came, I lost all my jobs and my only source of income is the allowance from my scholarships. Even though I have financial assistance, it goes into my monthly rent, food, laundry and other university fees.

I have tried to reach through my local government but then the supplies of the medicines rarely come since we are still on lockdown here on our country. I also tried to reach into women support groups but then their supplies are very limited.

So my sister told me today that her (until now I thought) boyfriend (I'll call her X) has been doing hormone therapy for almost 4 months in order to transition into being a woman. 
Apparently, X's parents are taking it very poorly, to the point of maybe kicking her out of their house. I realize that X's been having a very hard time and coming out to my family must have been extremely difficuly, specially after how her parents reacted. The thing is, I don't think it's a big deal, or a deal at all. So she's a woman, okay, I'm glad that she embraced who she is and had the courage to speak up for herself. 

The only thing I want is some advice. When they told me, I just said ""so what?"", because I was not expecting it and it caught me a bit off ward. When my sister and X left I just sent her a text saying that they will both always have a family in me and can count on me for anything, but I don't know if X will be comfortable with us (me and my parents) knowing ""him"" as a her and maybe she thinks that we're just acting aloof like we don't care and that we actually think it a big deal. Is there a way to let her know that we accept her for who she is and that we're just glad that she's making my sister happy and that she's finally free to be herself? 

Also, I would like to ask if anyone here can tell me a bit about their experience, what they went through, how they felt, etc. I know it's a very personal thing to ask, but I feel that I will understand X better if I get some other points of view and angles on how being transexual has affected other people's lives. I just want to make her know that she should feel good and normal no matter what her parents say, and maybe be able to empathize with her more deeply.

Not as pretty as other girls, don't pass like other trans girls. Feels shitty.

Sitting here working a graveyard shift at a nursing home, these old people say things like. ""Youre a nice young man. Your parents must be proud of the man you are."" And that doesn't help. At all.

What do I do here? Like.. I just want to get through my shift. Not always this bad but today its such crap.

I really hate having people think of me as a straight man. If people are going to think of me as a man, I would much rather they think of me as a gay man than a straight man. It feels like it brings me closer to people seeing me as feminine, and it feels like people are less judgemental of feminine men if they're gay.

I really try to avoid it, I craft my sentences really carefully to avoid revealing the gender of someone I've dated.

It's also probably had a huge impact on my dating life also because I really don't want women to see me as interested in them sexually, I just want them to see me as interested in them as friends. I have nothing against hooking up or dating someone really quickly after meeting them, but it's just a really big deal for me to make female friends(like it is for lots of women), and cause I'm still in the closet, I feel like it becomes way more difficult to do that if they know I I'm sexually interested in women.",trans,"For people still in the closet do you avoid letting people know you're ""straight""(in their eyes)?",1599404508.0,"{'created_utc': 1599379308, 'id': 'ini98w', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""So I'm talking about people who are closeted Lesbian MTF and Gay FTM, but most other people would perceive you as a straight man or straight woman.

Today I saw one of my friends and to clarify before quarantine they had long hair and over the quarantine they had shaved their head so it’s really short. Also one of my other friends who are a lot closer with them told me to call them George (previously Georgina) and gave me that look. 

You know that look where you just should known what they mean and I didn’t know what she meant.

Anyway I’m asking for help here as I’m too antisocial and shy to ask them in person and I don’t have their phone numbers sooooo...

I am trying to find cool sounding girl names just for fun. I'm a cis male but I've always been interested in cool sounding names and I only have a list of male names but if I ever do decide to transition I want to have a cool sounding name. I'm honestly not to sure if I'm trans or not I don't dislike being a guy but I feel like being a woman would be better? Idk it's hard to explain.

2020-09-08 10:11:02,ioqze7,3,1,"I hope it is okay to ask for advice here. I want to preface this by saying I really screwed up with my friend and I know it was largely my fault and I feel guilty. I am asking for advice on how I can be a better ally to the trans community and a better friend. Sorry for this ridiculously long post.

A week ago I had 2 coworkers and a friend over for dinner. The friend is a trans woman, and she is a great person, and I was really excited for her to finally be coming over to my house. I don’t get to hang out with her a lot unfortunately so this was very special. 

I don’t know my coworkers that well because I just started a new job, but I liked them because they seemed very kind and accepting towards me. I didn’t really for see any issues with this dinner, as I was sure they would be kind and respectful towards my friend.

The night was going really well, everyone chatting and getting along. Yay! But then my coworkers both misgendered my friend on espérate instances. The first was very obvious, referring to her as “him.” I immediately corrected her and said “her,” but I knew it had already hurt my friend, who is very sensitive about being a newly transitioning trans woman. Then, the other coworker was talking about shopping and vaguely indicated that she wasn’t sure whether my friend would shop in the women’s or men’s section, to which my friend answered that she would shop in the women’s section. 

At the end of the night I drove my friend home and apologized for my coworkers. She said it wasn’t my fault and not to worry. This is, in retrospect, where I first fucked up: I said maybe I should have told my coworkers before hand to make sure they didn’t misgendered her. My friend said nothing at the time, but after I dropped her off at home she texted me asking me “So you thought your coworkers might misgender me? Do I not pass?” 

I started freaking out. Obviously I had offended her which was not my intention. I wanted to reply as quickly, compassionately, and honestly as possible so as not to make the situation worse. This is where I really started fucking up. (Note: I feel that what I’m about to say will upset many of you, please know that I was really just trying to be honest with her, as I am with all of my friends. I didn’t mean to hurt her and didn’t have any idea how to proceed other than to just be honest.) to summarize to conversation; I first told her that I think the concept of pass/not pass is stupid and that to me she is entirely a woman (I wish that I had also said “you don’t need to prove to anyone that you’re a woman,” but I didn’t convey that as I had hoped), and that it is obvious that she identifies as a woman. Then I said that if her question is “can people tell that I’m not cis?” I would say yes. This was a horrible answer and had I taken the time to put myself in her shoes I don’t think I would have said this, but I still don’t know what the appropriate response would have been, so my first question is what would have been a better way to diffuse this obviously sensitive topic from the get-go? But wait, it gets worse.

She responded with a direct question. I am a very honest person and would never lie to a friend who asks me a direct question. She asked (paraphrased) “How do I not pass? Is it just my voice, or something else?” (Not in those exact words, but a direct question to that affect). We originally met off a friend-finding app in which I could tell that she was trans from her photos. This didn’t bother me in the least, but because of this I wanted to be especially honest in saying that there was something visible. So I told her that there was some physical aspect that I couldn’t put my finger on, and maybe it was a facial aspect (okay, this is admittedly probably my biggest fuck up of the night bc who tf tells someone their face is wrong? It was an awful thing to say, but in the moment I thought I was just being honest). 

I want to directly quote her response because I don’t think there’s a proper summary: “Yeah, really wasn’t looking for the truth now. Especially something I really don’t have the power to change. That just makes me feel worse. My entire day is ruined and I’m definitely just going to cry myself to sleep. Maybe, don’t invite me to dinner anymore. It wasn’t just them, it’s all these fucking customers and now you tell me my facial structure doesn’t pass. Like, I’m done with today.”

I didn’t respond, and later she texted me again saying she just needed to vent and it wasn’t my fault. We started texting about some more casual stuff, but I know that what I said really hurt her and I was definitely in the wrong at multiple points throughout the conversation. I feel guilty for ruining our friendship and making her feel even worse about herself after an already difficult night. I don’t think there is any way for me to properly mend our friendship, but if you think there is, please let me know because I really valued her as a friend. My main questions though, to help me avoid ever hurting someone like this again, are these:

1. Would it have been appropriate to tell my coworkers ahead of time that my friend is trans and make sure they knew to use the proper pronouns? And if so, would it be okay to tell the friend that I told them this, or should I keep that to myself unless asked directly?

2. How could I respond if someone asks if they “pass”? I really do think it’s a stupid concept. If you are a woman, I will refer to you as a woman. If you are a man, I will refer to you as a man. There is no need for you to physically prove to me that you are the gender you tell me you are. However, I know not everyone feels that way and that many people worry about whether they are perceived as the gender that they identify with, so how should I respond if I honestly can tell that someone is not cis? As I write this I already feel that my view on the topic is somewhat unhelpful and biased, so maybe someone can help me changing the view altogether. 

From there I see what I did wrong. Obviously I should NOT have given some specific aspect that didn’t “pass.” This is never a good idea. I think I generally should not have given any answer to confirm the whole “do I pass?” concept and should’ve just stated that she doesn’t need to prove to anyone that she’s a woman... or something. Maybe I’m wrong there, too. I keep going over this conversation in my head wondering what I could have done better at every step, instead of progressively getting worse with every response as I got more panicked. So now I am asking people who may have been through similar situations what, what can I do better next time? Even if I can’t fix this, is there anything I can say to her to make her not feel bad about herself?

I have never considered myself transphobic, but I also never imagined that I would be such an awful friend. I just want to do better by my friend and your community.

TLDR: my trans friend asked me why I thought she didn’t pass and I gave a really insensitive answer, but I want to do better. 

P.S. I will completely understand if people respond to this with anger, as I am also angry with myself for how I handled this.

     “If you woke up tomorrow as (opposite gender), would you still consider yourself (current gender)?”

What I’m stuck on is if the main character realizing this by wearing women’s clothing is inappropriate. I am trans myself but not mtf so I don’t want to write anything negatively.

I always thought trans people were always upset with their assigned gender, but I might be wrong.  Even though I plan to help her/him through this, I just want to know if she may be experimenting or going through a phase.  I dont want to jump the gun and start her on a transition if they are still trying to figure out their identity."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My 13 year old', 'created': 1599766390.0}"

He was asking about being in a relationship with a transgender woman. He is straight. I explained to him that it wasn't any person's job to come out to him, nor reveal all of their personal information at any point. He felt frustrated because he wants to have children, and I am guessing he would wait until marriage to have sex, so he thought it was a long time to wait to realize that his goal of having biological children would not be possible for him with this partner.

I didn't know what to say to this, honestly. I would really like to give him an answer but was kind of lost. He of course could adopt/have kids through another method. But he also was concerned about a woman not having what he ""was interested in"". Again, did not know what to say. How can I give him an honest, realistic, answer?

I went to the sperm bank yesterday because I am startingt hrt this week. It turns out that I am sterile at the moment, no swimmers at all.

They said that it could be the result of tucking on a regular basis. Does anyone have any related experiences about this subject?

They also said delaying my hrt for 6 weeks (sigh)and also stop tucking will increase my chances of producinh sperm. I obviously can get behind the hrt part. But I've read alot about tucking and I couldn't find any source that confirms this.

Am I sterile and 6 weeks won't matter.
That means delaying my hrt again and I absolutely hate that.

Thanks for reading :)
Hope someone has some advice or experiences.

Questions include:

EXPERIENCES:

SOCIETAL:
• What are some of your basic fears?
• How do you guys walk down the streets in the day and in the night?
• How do people treat you daily after or while in transition? (I'd especially like it if you guys would include what country you're living in and your race)
• How do you usually deal with bigots?
• What are some of your internal struggles?
• How do your friends and family treat you?
• What are the drastic differences in living as the gender you're transitioned in from the sex you were born as?
• Do people regularly misgender you?
• How do you think men percieve you?
• What are your typical experiences in bars and nightclubs?
DATING:
•If you transitioned later in life, (for lack of a way to ask the question) how different is dating for you?
•What are your usual fears in going on a date?
•What are your fears in dating?
•If you're straight, how do you think people percieve you when a straight guy brings you to meet friends, family and such.

For a lot of the trans guy ones it was trans males who are gay, bi or just being a femtrans guy. 
And personally I think of myself kind of as a femtrans guy cuz ya boi does blush real easily and gets all flustered easily and gets called a tsundere a lot, I don't think I am but I lowkey like the teasing. 
But the video started to get me thinking that maybe i'm just a ""transtrender"" and am just lying to myself and just doing it for attention but I recently tried to do something stupid because a now former friend was being transphobic deadnaming me misgendering me all on purpose all threw text and the worst part is he kind of scares me because I'm usually the tall one in the group but he's so much taller then me and always rubs it in!
I'm sorry I'm getting a bit carried away. 
But idk, I've been feeling really dysphoric lately and feeling invalid and just been so scared about what will happen when i go back to school because I go to a catholic school. 
Please help me? Please be blunt if you think I may be a ""transtrender"". And if not please tell me because I really need the mental support.

Hey guys.

I've been having a real trouble lately with myself.

I identify as female, but lately I've been looking at myself in the mirror and all I can see is an ugly male face looking back.

I think my mental health is dipping due to lockdown and so my self image is spiralling and I can only see what I dont want to be at the moment.

What I was wondering and hoping, is if some of you kind souls would be able to point out some female role models for me.
You see, I've noticed I'm not typically feminine, as I have a lot of behaviours which are more masculine and a lot of interests that are stereotypically seen as male interests. Now I dont buy into gender roles or gender stereotypes. But I grew up with them and I cant shake them fully yet so my self image doesn't align right with how I feel it ""should"" be.

So what i was hoping is if I could get some help in finding images or something about women who weren't typically feminine. I'm still soft and love hugs and hate fighting, but I love games and sitting in and snacking and FPS games and anime and stuff. So I just want someone I can see myself in. That I WANT to see myself in...

Does any of this make sense?
I'm sorry for prattling on... i just dont see myself as I want to be and its poisoning me. I feel like I'm falling apart even though there's nothing wrong with me.

2020-09-11 22:00:35,ir09e0,2,1,"Hey everyone! Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Perhaps you all can help me with some complex feelings I've been having. 💖

So for a bit of context, I'm 24, MTF, and I work in retail. Despite being fairly early in transitioning physically (2 months HRT, 2 sessions of laser) I'm able to pass pretty consistently. I'm out to basically everyone in my life, including at my job, and I get gendered correctly/called the right name by basically everybody. And it's great!!

However, I'm early enough on to where I still feel a good deal of dysphoria some days. Obviously this is enough of a problem on its own, but it becomes more complicated when talking to strangers. Like I said before, I work at retail, so I've had some pretty bad experiences with a certain demographic of customer. Thankfully no one's been outright transphobic towards me, but because of all the other stuff I've dealt with, I'm always cautious around those types of people. And on days when I'm feeling dysphoric and insecure, I'm extra on-guard when it comes to getting misgendered, to the point where, even when someone genders me correctly, I'm afraid something'll ""give me away"" and they'll do something to make me uncomfortable. And then afterwards, I feel guilty because like, they got it right, why should I feel bad?

Thankfully, this doesn't happen most days, but when it does, it really sucks!! I imagine a lot of this will go away on its own as the hormones and everything else works its magic and I get more comfortable and confident in my body. But until then, how do I shut up my dumb paranoid brain and just enjoy the euphoria of being gendered correctly? Have y'all experienced anything like this?

2020-09-12 09:49:47,ir9stn,1,1,"I wanted to post an experience I had today about how a classic rock song touched my heart. I hope others can appreciate it as much as I did.

I went for a 5k jog this morning and had an inspiration for writing an uplifting blog post that I will put to paper soon. I was listening a rock-n-roll jogging music playlist and I couldn’t believe how applicable some of the lyrics were to experiences that I’ve had since coming to the realization I am transgender. 

In the middle of my jog being hot and sweaty, the Jackson Brown song [Running on Empty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq25ZJwZJzU) started playing. As it progressed, verse after verse struck yet another cord and brought up many emotions. The words went straight to my heart, the tears began to flowing and I sobbed. This time however was an outpouring of positive emotions. 

When I got home and [read the lyrics](https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Jackson-Browne/Running-on-Empty) the tears just started pouring again and I knew I need to share this.

I'm not sure if others will relate but *Running On Empty* is definitely my anthem now. Thank you Jackson!

Following are the lyrics along with my commentary for those that are interested:  


&gt;Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels   
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields

Time is getting away me. As I look back and see all the things that could have been but weren't. As such I need be true to me before I'm dead.  


&gt;In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-on-one   
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

When I was young, I was able to sweep the gender incongruence into the closet and keep on moving but had no clue where I was headed. Still now, I am running, but I don't know where that is going to lead me, other than to know it will be some place better!  


&gt;Running on (running on empty)   
Running on (running blind)   
Running on (running into the sun)   
But I'm running behind

I've been running on empty and blind for more than a decade filled with worsening depression and escalating dysphoria. Now I'm running into my future knowing I'm quickly running out of time.  


&gt;Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive   
Trying not to confuse it, with what you do to survive

I'm just now learning how to love myself but it's so hard given the toxic masculinity and internalized transphobia I've harbored for more than 40 years. Add to that the struggles with my marriage and what not. The doubts and uncertainties make it so confusing and at times I feel I'll die before I make it. Will I survive this point that I'm at?  


&gt;In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own   
I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on

I thought that I had my life mapped out. I knew where I was headed and who I was. Now I'm 55 and all I knew is in question. This is just beginning of my journey.  One that I never imagined I would be undertake. How did I get here I will never know. All I can is get on the road and head into my future.  


&gt;Everyone I know, everywhere I go   
People need some reason to believe

Family, friends, coworkers and society have no clue what we are going through. They truly need a reason to believe us. Without that belief comes bigotry and hatred. It's sad that it falls on my shoulders to give them that reason to believe but will do so for those who are open minded.  


&gt;I don't know about anyone, but me

How true this is. We really don't know anybody but ourself. Sadly though, for the longest time, I didn't know who I was anymore but I am now slowly discovering myself. I will be better for it.  


&gt;If it takes all night, that'll be all right   
If I can get you to smile before I leave

I will give anybody the time to learn what it is like to be transgender. It is my hope that they will understand, accept us, be compassionate and allies. It is my wish that they will have a smile before I leave but know that that isn't always going to happen. I need to accept that.  


&gt;Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels   
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels

Need I say more? Imaging waking up at 53 and discovering you are transgender but never outwardly expressing a single bit of gender variance. How freaking crazy is that?


&gt;Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through   
Looking into their eyes, I see them running too

I had a few friends I used to lean on. That has changed, it’s inevitably. The thing is, I realize that we all have our own issues and their lives are passing them by just as fast. I have to take care of myself.  


&gt;Honey, you really tempt me You know the way you look so kind I'd love to stick around, but I'm running behind

This verse ripped my heart out due to the struggles with my wife and our 36 year marriage. For two years I've been tempted to remain the same and tried to fight this in order to be what she needs. I would love to remain in our marriage if she can accept me for who I am but the clock is ticking. My time here is slipping away.  


&gt;(Running on) You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find   
(Running blind) Running into the sun, but I'm running behind

Since realizing I am transgender, I have been trying to figure out what that means for my life and where this is going to lead me. Trying to figure this out and give my wife answers was making me insane.  I had to let go, give up on a plan and just live things one day at a time. Doing so has taken a huge burden off my shoulders but leaves our relationship with such uncertainty.

2020-09-13 07:42:02,iru1ed,0,3,"I'm not sure if I'm posting to the right sub, but here goes...
Okay, so I need to unload and get some things off my chest. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice,  validation or opinions. I just need to write down what I’ve been thinking and put it out there for people like me to see. Despite distance and varying circumstances, we are all kin in a crazy world and if anyone understands me it you all.
So there is a lot going through my mind about who and what I am. I think I’m needing this vent because I know I want to be a woman, but it also scares me. I don't feel right in my body ever. For years I've been insecure, even when people tell me I'm handsome. I know a large part of it has to do with not liking me. 
I remember being a young teenager and home alone wearing my mom's panties as I cried, yanking on my penis yelling at it to go away and get off me. I still feel that way and wish I could just have a vagina  and have nothing in the way. 
However I’m terrified at the thought of transitioning or coming out. If I could take a pill and wake up a woman I'd do it without hesitation. But that's obviously not happening and I don’t see how my body could change in the ways I'd like. I have super broad shoulders and thick, muscular legs. I also have a very strong brow. This is all very superficial, I know, but it’s one factor that holds me back.
I’ve also been through rough times with my wife about crossdressing. Coming out to her went very badly so I haven't even admitted I’m transgender. She was not accepting at all of me crossdressing and as much as I feel hurt that she doesn’t accept me, I’ve promised her that I'd give these things up. I don’t want to hurt her at all and it’s very conflicting to choose between her happiness and mine.
I’m also terrified of losing my kids. They are my entire world and it gives me anxiety thinking of not having them close. I’ve read stories of kids accepting a transition with no issues, but I have to admit there is fear of them not understanding.
Aside from just daydreaming about being a woman and wishing i was in the right clothing, I came to realise recently that I’ve never viewed porn in the way any guys I know do. Even when I was a teenager I always had a kind of envy for the women I looked at. I adore their shape and what they wear and I NEVER think about having sex with them. I’m always curious what it’s like to BE them. It’s still that way now. A few years ago before I met my wife, I was SUPER into sissy hypno. But as time has gone on I’ve grown away from it because I feel it’s not me. It don’t want to be a man dressed as a woman being fucked. I want to be a woman having sex. Things like Sissy Caption stories bridge the two, but I’m lately infatuated with female pov. I love seeing the woman's perspective and imagining that’s me as I look down. I see woman out in public and get jealous of their shape and bodies and what they’re wearing. 
On my Tumblr I used to post sissy captions I found. Now I’m posting more about just being a woman and also women's fashion. I’m starting to notice I’m moving away from the sex aspect of being a woman and more thinking about my own body and disphoria as well as existing day to day as a woman.
So I don’t know what I hope to achieve here... I could rant for days and don’t know anyone I could talk to about everything. Whoever is reading this I just want you to know I appreciate you listening. Maybe someone reading this will relate and feel less alone. Take care sisters and brothers.

I know a large part of it has to do with not liking me. \r\nI remember being a young teenager and home alone wearing my mom's panties as I cried, yanking on my penis yelling at it to go away and get off me. I still feel that way and wish I could just have a vagina  and have nothing in the way. \r\nHowever I’m terrified at the thought of transitioning or coming out. If I could take a pill and wake up a woman I'd do it without hesitation. But that's obviously not happening and I don’t see how my body could change in the ways I'd like. I have super broad shoulders and thick, muscular legs. I also have a very strong brow. This is all very superficial, I know, but it’s one factor that holds me back.\r\nI’ve also been through rough times with my wife about crossdressing. Coming out to her went very badly so I haven't even admitted I’m transgender. She was not accepting at all of me crossdressing and as much as I feel hurt that she doesn’t accept me, I’ve promised her that I'd give these things up. I don’t want to hurt her at all and it’s very conflicting to choose between her happiness and mine.\r\nI’m also terrified of losing my kids. They are my entire world and it gives me anxiety thinking of not having them close. I’ve read stories of kids accepting a transition with no issues, but I have to admit there is fear of them not understanding.\r\nAside from just daydreaming about being a woman and wishing i was in the right clothing, I came to realise recently that I’ve never viewed porn in the way any guys I know do. Even when I was a teenager I always had a kind of envy for the women I looked at. I adore their shape and what they wear and I NEVER think about having sex with them. I’m always curious what it’s like to BE them. It’s still that way now. A few years ago before I met my wife, I was SUPER into sissy hypno. But as time has gone on I’ve grown away from it because I feel it’s not me. It don’t want to be a man dressed as a woman being fucked. I want to be a woman having sex. Things like Sissy Caption stories bridge the two, but I’m lately infatuated with female pov. I love seeing the woman's perspective and imagining that’s me as I look down. I see woman out in public and get jealous of their shape and bodies and what they’re wearing. \r\nOn my Tumblr I used to post sissy captions I found. Now I’m posting more about just being a woman and also women's fashion. I’m starting to notice I’m moving away from the sex aspect of being a woman and more thinking about my own body and disphoria as well as existing day to day as a woman.\r\nSo I don’t know what I hope to achieve here... I could rant for days and don’t know anyone I could talk to about everything. Whoever is reading this I just want you to know I appreciate you listening. Maybe someone reading this will relate and feel less alone. Take care sisters and brothers. I wish you health and happiness."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Confused Rant', 'created': 1600008122.0}"

This is my first reddit post ever, sorry if I haven’t done it right or something but I’d really appreciate some advice!

I (19F) live in a uni house with four boys around the same age. We have all gotten extremely close and love staying up late having amazingly deep conversations and debates. The topic of gender has come up recently, with one of my housemates stating they do not feel satisfied with their current gender. This conversation led to him confiding in us all that he plans to eventually transition from a male to a female (probably at the end of the year). I feel so honoured and privileged to be able to experience this journey with him and am excited to support him in any way I can. I have asked a couple of questions to make sure I am using his preferred pronouns and name (he wants to still use the he/him pronouns and his current name for the time being).

So for the last few months I’ve been socially transitioning to FTM (currently 16 years old) and it has been a very euphoric but confusing journey for me. Until I was 11 or so, I was always very feminine. I’ve been showing subtle signs of possibly being trans since I was 12 (dislike of my hips/chest, always wearing baggy clothes, out of touch with femininity) but these could also easily just be signs of being gender non conforming. However these feelings became stronger and stronger the last few months and I’ve been feeling a lot of dysphoria with my body and how I’m viewed in society. I cannot stand having my chest/hips visible under my clothes and I feel extremely happy when I’m referred to as male. I feel very confused/nervous about my identity and myself when I’m presenting feminine but when I present masculine and actually pass I have this sense of confidence and euphoria. I do enjoy feminine clothes but only if I’m seen as a “guy in a dress” rather than a normal girl, which is why until I start T, I won’t wear feminine things. Right now I’ve transitioned only socially as FTM (except around my parents). 


This is my story so far and here is my pressing question:


Right now I feel very comfortable identifying as male. I have no past trauma other than a strained relationship with my mom which is being repaired now.

2020-09-13 22:16:22,is81jq,9,2,"Hi everyone!

Wasn't really sure where else to post this and this is probably gonna be kinda long and messy, so, sorry in advance!

Sheesh, where to start... Okay, here goes:

I used to have a really strong beard. And I mean REALLY strong, with a permanent beard shadow. I'd have stubble within a few hours and something actually resembling a fully grown heavy beard inside of a week. Like, this is what I looked like literally immediately after shaving, trying to use the lighting in my favor to make it appear less prominent:

https://preview.redd.it/wlp324c9lzm51.jpg?width=734&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d1fc49cae45ce252f6b6d66d09b125a389dda4e

And I can't really even begin to describe how much I hated it. I feel like maybe you guys on here will have some idea though. I'd basically schedule my life around shaving because I couldn't really shave every single day without irritating my skin, which is pretty sensitive. I'd actually move appointments around to different weekdays, cancel shit outright, plan my grocery shops sometimes several days in advance, use my hands to try to hide the bottom half of my face wherever I could get away with it inconspicuously, etc.

I also have virtually no pictures of myself for an entire chunk of my life (17-24) because I was just so damn freaking brutally uncomfortable with how I looked. Anytime like my mom would try to take a picture of me I'd usually be all grumpy about it and try to get out of it, and I'd always panic in any social situation where I had to have my picture taken and it would have been awkward to say no. I'd always come out of it with like a pit in my stomach.

Literally even just posting that photo right now was something that *still* made me kinda super uncomfortable. Which is just such bullshit.

There were for real so many days where I just stayed indoors all day and refused to even come out of my room and face my roommates, let alone go out, because I wasn't clean-shaven (or as close as I could even get to it back then) and I was letting my face get a rest from shaving against the grain (usually until I bled) to try to get as close a shave as I could.

I'm not exaggerating at all when I say this obsession with my facial hair cost me *years* of my life where I missed out on doing a lot of things I wanted. It also just generally made me super ridiculously miserable and crushed my self-esteem. I haven't really had much of that until recently, if I'm honest.

That's the short version of it. I could go on and on about this forever, but you get the idea.

And here's the thing. I think a lot of you will be able to relate in some way to the stuff I've described above. Because from where I'm standing this sounds a lot like the way I've seen dysphoria described by many trans people.

The weird part is though, I'm pretty pretty sure I'm cisgender. I'm gay as fuck, and I'm super happy with that and comfortable with my identity. It's one of the things about me I think I've always loved. I'm totally down to be a boy who likes boys. No reservations or hangups. I've never really questioned my gender identity either. It feels comfortable to be a dude. I genuinely don't think this is a case of internalized transphobia or me being oblivious or anything like that.

I've only really sat down and thought about this recently, but that does leave me with a pretty weird conclusion. Namely, that I'm a cis guy with beard dysphoria.

It's honestly not something I would ever have thought was possible, but obviously it is, because hi! Here I am! I'm real, I swear.

I'm also not conceited enough to think I'm like, *super mega special* and my situation is *totally unlike anyone else who's ever lived you wouldn't understand, mom.*

So I'm guessing it is actually a real thing, however rare, for people to feel dysphoric about a certain gender-affirming part of your identified gender. I mean, beards are pretty masculine right?

I guess what I'm saying is that if this was super confusing for me, I can't imagine how much worse it would've been for a transmasc person in the same situation with their beard just growing in cause of T, since they would also have been dealing with all sorts of self-doubt. Not to mention not wanting to give other people ammunition who might think they're '*not trans enough'* (blerrhghhhhh).

I've gathered that it's pretty normal for trans people to have minor doubts at many stages of their transition, but to feel like they have to pretend like they're always totally, super, 100% certain about everything to everyone around them so they won't be doubted and so it won't be used against them. Which is like, so shitty. God, people suck sometimes.

But yeah, I don't know where I'm even going with this anymore.

I guess if you've paid attention you've probably realized that I've been referring to my beard in the past tense. Because, fuck yes, I've since had laser hair removal every month for about the last 2-3 years, and here are a couple of 'after' picture for comparison from a road trip we did to australia last October. I must've taken like a squillion selfies on that trip! I kinda felt like I had to make up for lost time!

And here's an even more recent pic of me because lockdown drove me to bleach my hair out of sheer boredom:

And yes, I've been told I look like a fetus, and also yes, I was mistaken for a teenager just last month despite being 26, but I just don't care. I actually have confidence now! That's like, wow. It's still something I can't completely believe sometimes. It's so crazy. I actually like looking into mirrors now because I'm stoked with how I look (most of the time. I've still got insecurities like anyone else!).

I'm not in any way exaggerating when I say that this was life-altering. It was expensive but given the way it's changed my life I'd have happily paid ten times as much even if I'd had to freaking take out a loan.

It's maybe given me a tiny bit of insight into how urgent and essential and *not-optional* it is for trans people to transition, since I can only imagine full-blown gender dysphoria must be a thousand times worse.

I mean, this was a thing that was probably barely even noticable to anyone else. I'm sure lots of people who know me barely even noticed much. But to me? It was colossal.

Thanks to anyone who's actually read to the end of my bizzare stream-of-consciousness, freeform mess of a post. Honestly? I'm not sure why I posted this. I think it was mostly for me, even though I'm not really sure how.

Bonus (and totally unrelated!):

I just got finished playing 'Tell Me Why', which is a story-driven game that just came out a few weeks ago, focusing around two twins, one of whom is a trans guy. It was so wholesome and amazing, and full of healthy representation. I just loved how totally unapologetically *queer* it was! I swear my gay little heart just about exploded with happiness.

Even if you're not the sort of person to play games usually, I'd recommend giving this one a try. The format is more like an interactive novel, honestly. There's not much gameplay other than walking around, making choices, and a few puzzles. Aside from that you just watch the amazing story unfold. I realize this isn't actually a gaming subreddit but I figured I'd mention it anyway. God. I want it to do well so badly, so we'll get more stuff like this!

2020-09-14 01:53:18,isbman,4,3,"Hey, folks.

I have done my own research, however, I find conflicting information and have not been able to find anything concrete, one way or the other.

I know, everyone is different and I am sure that contributes to the lack of anything definitive.

That being said; I am still curious if anyone else has been able to come across information a bit more reliable.

I'm making an appointment to see a Gender Therapist as I am considering taking HRT. I am not looking to make a full transition (as the more I think about it, the less I feel like I conform to any one gender) but my body is naturally, stereotypically masculine and I honestly hate it.

I've read about people going on HRT, not to make the transition, but to get their bodies into a middle ground, some where that is more comfortable.  Reading this was incredibly re-affirming and validating to me and so I am considering it as an option.

My question, however, (now that background is out of the way) is how much can HRT affect one's ability to reproduce.

Again; I understand every body is different and thus, have read everything from ""not at all"" to ""sterile after 6 months.""

Is the range really so wide?
 Or can that be narrowed down?

While I embrace my femininity and want my outward appearance to reflect that, so that I can feel more comfortable in my skin, it is also, very important to me, that I am still able to father a child.

I have been transitioning (trans woman) since February 2018. I was approved for my bottom surgery last year, and the costs are covered by my insurance.

But I have an enormous obstacle, one that has me literally rocking and trying not to cry as I type this.

In January of this year, I lost my life partner. She was my designated caregiver for my surgery. Now I have no one even close to local, no family to speak of, and no friends who can fill her role.

I was a month away before COVID-19 hit. Now I'm close again, but i have no idea what to do. Kaiser said they don't cover in-home care after bottom surgery.

I'm completely lost and despondent over the thought of not being able to complete my goals. I'm losing sleep and I don't know what to do.

2020-09-14 13:36:46,iskzg2,8,2,"so around this time last year, a very close friend of mine came out to me as trans (mtf). they requested i start using their new preferred name n pronouns, which i was totally okay with and supportive of. i was the first person they came out to, and they requested i keep it on the down low until they were comfortable. i asked them about what was comfortable for them, and they said that around others/at school, i refer to  them with they/them pronouns and not use their new name, but when it was just us, they were comfortable trying out the new name and pronouns. 

we talked all the time, in and out of school, and it was really awesome to see my friend (who is a little shy) become more and more confident in their new identity, it was the first time i'd seen them so happy. they told me they'd like to begin shaving their face/legs, but couldn't get their hands on the needed stuff due to a transphobic parent at home. 

later that day, i went shopping. i picked up a few different kinds of razors, some more feminine scented deodorant (something they also wanted), and some shaving cream/body wash. i gave it to them in private, and they said they were really excited about the chance to use it all. and to clarify, i told them to use them whenever they were comfortable and ready. 

this was right before the covid shut down of schools, and they abruptly stopped speaking to me. not answering my texts, it was like a switch flipped. all our other friends say they were still talking to everyone else, and they were fine. i was heartbroken, they were sort of my only close friend. 

do you guys think i was overstepping my boundaries by purchasing the stuff for them? i thought it would be helpful and a way to show how supportive i was, and still am of them since they didn't have their own money and a transphobic home life. i would hate for that to be the case. just wondering if y'all have had experience with anything like this or if you would see it as crossing a line? 

tldr; my friend came out as trans, but didn't have access to the feminine hygiene products they wanted, so i got them a little care package of them. they stopped speaking to me immediately afterwards. did i overstep my boundaries? i really miss my friend 💙

Keep in mind I will be both translating and summarising this conversation. I could understand he implied everyone of these words as polite as he possibly could. 

""My advice would be to wait till you're over 18 or even 20. At these ages it's not so out of the ordinary to feel this way. At these stages, labelling yourself as anything could be very damaging and I would suggest you try to push these thoughts aside as you have to prepare for college."" 

That's the best way I could've summarised what he said and... It was odd, truly. Especially because what I told him was that I have been feeling this way even before puberty. He seems to be disregarding that... Aside from that, he also told me how I shouldn't label myself as such which just makes me so confused. Not only have I seen many do the same, which isn't a valid reason but still it felt incredible, in serious situations I don't represent myself as transexual but rather just... Say that I'm uncomfortable with the body I have or that I would rather have a female body. 

The worst part of this is he told me to just suppress and push down these feelings and focus on my school work even though I did tell him before and after his talk that this situation, feeling this way made me constantly distracted.

I really want to have faith in someone that has studied this for years but somehow the answer of ""you're not ready yet"" doesn't satisfy me anymore. These feelings have been present for years and only reason I haven't told anyone after I got to puberty, between 14-16 especially was because I thought was simply not ready for anything this big and that I shouldn't bring it up. 

In the end, I may as well go to some more doctors before I eventually decide it, most likely with a doctor somewhere else and maybe international as in my country(Turkey) LGBT+ is in a hard state.

2020-09-14 20:48:35,ists0h,24,1,"I have been transitioning going on two years. Most of that time has been in Berlin, a city that has treated me so, so kindly. To mark the publication of Rowling's ""Troubled Blood"", i wanted to give tell my story, which i think typifies how the vast majority of cis women feel about us tranfemales, especially in Women's toilets.

I will begin with the observation that Berliners, unlike some in my home land of Australia, or the US, or the UK, do NOT work themselves into ischaemic apoplectic paroxysms about ""which bathroom"" questions.

I came back to Berlin in April 2019 after just having split temporarily from my partner owing to my transition. We decided we needed some time apart to process our very different griefs. Those first days were dark for both of us and dreadful for our smallest child, whom we could offer no promises to about our future: i thought my transition would cost me my 22 year relationship with the person i loved most in the world and i missed her and our children so, so much. My skin ached physically for a hug when i thought of them. At that time when transition was new, women's toilets were a supreme source of intense stress for me, and i would often hold off all day, and when i had to go i was a quivvering wreck. I pass reasonably well, so i would have been OK would it have not been for my voice. But in my stressed state i was full of involuntary vocal ticks, where i would blurt out my partner's name or one of our children's name involuntarily. 

So here i was at the washbasins in the women's toilets at a very cute Kneipe in Alexanderplatz, looking dead straight ahead and trying to be unnoticeable as i could, when out came, loudly, our son's nickname as his image filled my head. And, being a tick, it came out in my most primitive male voice. There was a woman at the basin next to me. Instantly she turned her head towards me and our gazes met, and i could tell she instantly knew what was going on, and that she could also see my recognition of her awareness in my eyes. I could see shock in her eyes. She took a step towards me and i thought for a dreadful moment i thought she would hit me; i was already beginning to imagine how devastated and crushed i would feel. In that split second her deft mind processed her shock in an act of supreme emotiona maturity and kindness: she stepped up to me, touched me gently, affectionately and very sincerely on the upper arm and told me how lovely i looked. I  just broke down and wept at such a display of spontaneous, heartfelt  kindness. I could scarely believe neither this woman's kindness, nor her presence of mind to turn shock, an emotional state that often provokes instinctive, self defensive agression, into an understanding of not only what was going on, but a deduction of and deep empathy for what she believed i was feeling.

I have no idea who this woman is. Let's call her Katja for the rest of my story. She smiled at me and we parted ways, she of course not expecting a whit in return for her kindness.

And i swear that this little scenario is highly typical of the attitudes of cis women to me, not only on ""which bathroom"" questions but in every aspect of my life.

And of cis men too. Another time saw me in the grips of a psychotic episode, sprawled on the platform at Bahnhof Adlershof. I had reacted badly to a too high dose, too powerful anxiolytic drug my doctor had hamfistedly prescribed me for panic attacks. I had an utterly terrifying motion hallucination and i could well have fled under a train. I hit the ground and dug my fingers as hard as i could into the asphalt because i was convinced the earth would open and swallow me up. A man in a suit sat down beside me, crosslegged (no concern for his suit) in the evening crowds, asked me my name, told me his, ""David"", and kept repeating to me that he had called the paramedics, that everything would be OK and that he was not going anywhere until the paramedics came. I layed my head on his lap and he stroked my hair gently and kept making contact with me, asking me whether i could hear him. The paramedics came and stayed with me until the dreadful psychosis slowly eased its grip and warm, wonted reality flowed back into my being.

""David"", like the beautiful Katja in the toilets at Alexanderplatz, disappeared into the cold Berlin December night, expecting nothing in return, acting out of pure kindness.

We hear of so much hate, begotten of so much misunderstanding, and so much ignorance that we forget what Jane and Joe Ordinary are truly like sometimes. Truly awesome, empathic creatures well able to open themselves to those of difference.

2020-09-14 21:45:36,isux65,9,1,"Hi I hope I’m okay to post here. I’m not trans, but am wanting to understand more so visiting this subreddit. My interest stems from the fact more people are open about it, I have a friend who has come ‘out’ as trans, and I had gender confusion as a child. I hope I don’t offend anyone here I am really wanting to better understand and also know there will be different experiences and opinions. 


Basically, when I had gender confusion as a child I thought I was born the wrong sex, I didn’t feel anything like a girl but I felt like a boy, I often wore unisex clothes (side note do they even do ‘unisex’ clothes now?! I’m sure it used to be more common), I wanted short hair, I didn’t like anything typically feminine. 


Anyway so I never told anyone about it and just pushed it down, I still don’t feel like a girl and people often think I’m a lesbian I suppose because I’m not feminine. I think that it was never really about wanting to be the other sex, it was wanting to be the other gender...or perhaps another way to put it is according to my sex I ‘should have’ or felt as though I should have been more feminine than I was. I acted more like a boy, (as in more typically masculine) etc. ...i hope you are still with me. So my point is that now I don’t see it in this way of how I ‘should be’ I.e act in accordance with a typical female be more feminine, I’m not feminine really but that doesn’t lead me to have confusion about my gender or sex. 

I am a female (by sex) who does not feel feminine but this is my body and sex and I’m okay with that, because it’s fine to be a non-feminine girl, girls don’t all have to act a certain way etc etc. 

So my question is how far off is a trans persons experience and perception from this, because I guess the different is those feelings of not being the right sex stay, but is it much more than I have described?. 

And I’m sorry if this is ignorant, I’m sure more many it is not the case, but...if we lived in a society where males and females weren’t so defined as they are now (in the way eg make up is feminine and for girls, girls like and do x whereas boys like masculine games and do x) so if there were no expectation of what it meant to be a boy or girl, would you still identify as the other sex? Is it that you feel your body is wrong or is it that the traits etc aren’t in accordance with you sex at birth? Would you still be trans if the the male sex and the female sex had an even distribution of masculine and feminine traits? If you want to be the other sex (as in transition) then is this because it typifies the gender you think you should be? So if a man felt feminine is a female body desirable because it’s associated with being feminine? Or is there something intrinsic to about the sex, regardless of traits?

First of, I’m not a trans person but I wanted to understand you more and I sincerely apologise if my post is offensive or if I can’t actually post since I’m not part of the community (I’ll delete the post then). Also excuse me for my English, since I am still learning.
Recently has been a lot of polemic with this topic and I am totally against the discrimination and abuse some people give you. The idea of genitalia defining personality is a nonsense and has no biological reasoning. Gender is something that has changed with time and also changes between countries. But for that same reason I thought, precisely because it is something so volatile and oppressive, why carry on in assigning ourselves with that? Wouldn’t it be more productive if people who does not fit in the stereotypes associated with his sex (gender) revealed themselves against that structure? Like, for example, in the case of a male “yes, I’m a man, I have XY chromosomes and so, so what?” and try to accept their body as it is instead of change it through a painful journey. With this I don’t mean in any way give up their true selves, their personalities, clothes, or anything, just the fact of giving up on what society says and assignsting themselves as what they want. I feel like it says that actually they can’t imagine a woman or man being that way.
I think that it’s better to break all that gender policy and just express and be how you feel. Additionally, if we maintain the gender structure, it would cause more people to have dysphoria in the future (I myself had it when I was a child). I think that this is the best way to break it. Don’t think you have to change anything because you are already expressing this, it’s just because of the approach and measures for the future and most important the dysphoria problem. In people who already had to live through this times I agree that it’s probably the best/only method, but we might be able to avoid it in future generations.
The gender thing has a very painful history (specially for woman) and I don’t think that follow it is a very good thing.
What do you think? If you see errors, I would like you to point them because I wanted to share this ideas with you in order to perfectionate them, because I don’t want to harm anyone. So I am interested in your comments and also sorry if someone get offended about this, I know it’s controversial to talk about this things but I feel you are the best people to help me understand and if you want to I’ll delete the post without any problem.

2020-09-15 01:18:31,isynyo,1,1,"Hi all, 

Anyone can answer this question obviously but I just wanted to share a personal experience and am curious to see if anyone else can relate? 

Since I have medically transitioned (testosterone for 6 years now and I pass as very cis-het) I have noticed more and more as time goes on how much men (cis men in their 30s to 40s) constantly try to act like experts in skills that they're not. 

For example, I'm an arborist. This year because of covid I got let go and found a seasonal job as a utility worker luckily. I consider myself an expert in trees and chainsaw. In my new job we work with limbing up or falling trees a little (10% of the job is tree work). Since working at this new job I have run into several men stating their experts in chainsaw, especially once they find out about my background they make sure to tell me about how great they are at running saw. But when the time comes whether it's using the chainsaw or doing basic chainsaw maintenance their BS shows significantly. I try to step in to gently show them proper techniques or ways to use the saw or sharpen a saw etc and am met with hostility and a parade of ""I've been running chainsaw since- when you were just learning 2+2."" Like weird ass hostile attitude?!

That is just one example of many. Why are --some-- men like this? I haven't seen this in trans men as much- at least I don't think. And I really don't see this in the women I work with. But many men I work with and have just ran into randomly in life I am constantly met with men trying to show off or just blatantly lying about themselves to seem idek smarter? I don't understand this. 

When I presented and ""identified"" more as female, I never had this issue or noticed this with men. At least I don't think I did. 

Any other trans folk here who have been met with more hostility/ machismo from cis men??

2020-09-15 03:12:18,it0jbw,7,1,"Hello you beautiful people. I (36 AMAB and pre anything) am looking for ideas or stories on how you came out to your children. My son is 11 years old. My biggest concern is him being afraid of being bullied from it. He has had bully issues in the past already. Thankfully my wife and I are much more understanding than my parents were. My parents put me through conversion therapy and it made things extremely hard until I finally gave up on that stuff and came out to my wife. There are little things I have done his whole life while I was still in my own denial that will probably make more sense to him like have toes painted. 

Part of my upbringing was that men are strong, brave, and don't cry kind of toxicness so unfortunately I have echoed that early on in his life not realizing how wrong it was. But he most likely sees me as a ""man's man"" because of this so he might be shocked and confused as well. He is in therapy so he has a release outside of my wife and I if and when he is ready for that. 

I have only came out to myself and quickly after my wife for about 2 months now and I am still exploring everything with a willingness to do what feels right and good. I still question if I am genderfluid or MTF. And part of that exploring is to be my feminine side and not hide in the bedroom at night for my only time of doing it. I dont want to feel ashamed of it anymore and by hiding to be me is only making those shame feelings worse. I still have to figure it out and I know that but I dont want to rush into anything I might regret later. Of course my wife and I need to go over how we decide to handle this with our son before that happens as well but it would be nice to offer things that have helped make it smoother that others have done. Or maybe things to avoid that didn't workout so well as hard as that might be for sharing. Please feel free to private message me as well if you wish to keep it not open forum.

2020-09-15 07:47:39,it4arq,15,1,"I was accused of being transphobic, (not by a trans person mind you) and it is has really bothered me. Based on how I feel, and what I have read and what I have spent time researching, in order to not be totally uninformed, I am not.

That being said I might be wrong and I would like some clarification. I don’t expect that it’s anyone’s job to answer my question, but as a human it would be nice and I value and respect all your time and all your opinions.

Let me get right to it: As a straight person, or as a gay person, I have understood (and it’s pretty clear from a few google searches) that if you find the idea of kissing a member of a sex you are not attracted to be very unappealing, or something you would never do, that does not make you homophobic. That just makes you a person with a sexual preference. In order to be Homophobic, you have to be in some way against, scared of, or have some type of ill-will towards gay people. If you want nothing but the most fabulous success for all, however decide it’s not for you, then that’s just a preference and is normal. 

I was following this logic and here’s where I got accused of transphobia. If you are kissing someone who you believe to be a specific scientific gender (as we are taught in schools from a young age), yet they have not revealed anything to you, and you only find out after, let’s say, proceeding further with this person, am I as an Individual not allowed to be upset/disappointed/unhappy that the person did not tell me up front that they might be different from what I am expecting? And if I find myself in this situation, is being upset because the person wasn’t upfront with me make me transphobic, even IF I wish nothing but success, happiness, and ultimate amounts of thriving to all trans people? 

To me the logical train of thought is I am allowed to have my preference and emotions the same as anyone, and when engaging in a deeply personal situation like this being disappointed/unhappy would make sense if you are not into said gender. But I am learning these things are nuanced and perhaps I am wrong. AND if I am wrong, what are the appropriate emotions to have? Or is there a right way to handle this? Or...what is...this has gotten my mind spinning a bit because I’m not sure where one’s own preferences end and someone else’s obligation begins. I have always believed that there are two sides to every equation, honesty is the best policy, and kindness and empathy are key. I’m getting the impression this has been the source of some conversation. 

I have tried to choose my words carefully as to not offend anyone, because this is not my goal, forgive any words I may have used, my overall message is simply where is the line on personal encounters. I am only here because as someone who has always advocated for equality I feel disheartened to have been called transphobic dispite my best efforts to uplift. I’m not playing the victim nor is this an ego boost, I know life is not fair and many people have had much worse things happen, but I honestly now am not sure I even know what I’m talking about related to the subject now so I could use some help getting some clarity so I can be more informed for the future.

2020-09-15 15:59:42,itbmpw,4,1,"Hi! So, my therapist asked me to write out my ‘gender story’. I wrote out a few paragraphs, but im not sure if what i wrote is good enough to be diagnosed with dysphoria. Id be mighty thankful if someone could read through it and let me know if I should be more descriptive with events in my life, thanks! (Also, apologies in advance for my poor writing skills, english was not an easy subject for me 😅)

In 2007 (when I was 9 years old), a movie called stardust came out. The movie itself is terrible, but it had a scene where a witch turns a man into a woman, and upon seeing this weird display of magic my brain started questioning a lot of things. Why was i born in the body im in? Why do i feel this weird jealousy with my little sister? Why did I have to wear baggy jeans and graphic t-shirts while my little sister got to walk around in sundresses, or questioning as to why i wasnt allowed to wear makeup outside of the house?

As I got older and moved towards puberty, I started to actively dislike the body I was born in. My parents told me that it was normal to not like your body that age. I started to hate the amount of body hair i was growing, and i had started to feel uncomfortable even looking at myself in the mirror. Looking down (physically) at myself was even worse, especially being able to see my genitalia more prominently. I used to go ridiculously far out of my way to wear baggy clothes to hide myself, even going as far to risk heat stroke on 100 degree days.

By the time i was a sophomore in highschool, i started to dabble in drag and just passed it off as me being a bit more leaning towards gay, despite being bisexual (and leaning towards women). Truthfully, wearing makeup and womans clothing made me happier than i had ever been up to that point, and thinking about transitioning was something that often got me through the day. I made up fantasy lives where I had moved away to a different state and had gone through with it and had started over.

I started talking openly about how much i disliked my body, knowing full well that the general response id get would be to the tune of ‘Go exercise’ or ‘diet better’. After all, these people id vent to had no idea i was living a lie. I lived like that for years, and its admittedly had lasting effects on my attitude towards myself. Somedays i find it hard to even go outside with how upset i am with myself. It has become easier since i came out, feeling more comfortable in clothes that are affirming with how i want to see myself.

Conceptually, the idea of being happy with how I look seems so alien to me that I dont think ive ever considered that it could be a reality. Just thinking about living life happily seems like something out of a fantasy novel. I would come up with reasons why it would never work, whether it be because of money or from social issues. All of that being said, the more and more people take me seriously about this, the happier i seem to get. The acceptance ive received over the past couple of months has been overwhelming. 

Im a particularly anxious person, who has a bad habit of second guessing everything about myself but i have never been more sure of something than i am that my body is incorrect. While i dont know what the inside of everyone elses head sounds like, i cant imagine that being this disgusted with yourself is normal. A common occurrence i seemed to catch myself falling into was getting huffy with people who would refer to me as a guy, or say that i wouldnt want to do something because of it. I would feel this intense level of guilt to the tune of “No, come back, i swear im only a guy in presentation and not in practice!”.
I just want to be comfortable around people i like, in a body i like. I once went with my partner and our friend to victorias secret (before coming out and covid, of course) and i think that was the happiest i had been in awhile. Being able to be surrounded by all the pretty lingerie and seeing all the beautiful people working there. Though, despite that happiness, there was a heavy jealousy. I ended up sneaking away to a nearby family restroom (we were in a mall), curling up in a rocking chair, and started crying because i wasnt the normal that i craved.

I feel disgusted with myself a lot, but presenting female is an excellent combatant against it. I believe what i feel is genuine gender dysphoria, and this has been the only thing thats alleviated my anxiety towards my body and my self. That being said, even when i present female, i still feel the anxiety but It appears in different forms now. Ill feel shitty for not filling out a bra right, or there being a slight bulge in the pants im wearing.
I know that hormones and grs arent a cure-all. I still have depression, and while i think having a more female presenting body will help, i know that my dislike for myself is something i will always have to work on.",trans,My Gender Story,1600210782.0,"{'created_utc': 1600185582, 'id': 'itbmpw', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi!

If they can do that again and help me collaborate if I do go through with asking for a low T prescription, I should be fine?

I am currently enrolled in a gender studies course and am looking to interview an open and honest person about their experience as a member of the trans community. 

Questions will regard experiences during your transition, with your family and your friends and other questions of that nature. The interview should only take 20-30 minutes or longer if you are willing!

I am very interested in learning more about persons of non traditional genders. This is a completely none judgmental conversation. I am aware of the biases and poor treatment of trans persons. I think this would be a really cool way to contribute to my own awareness and the awareness of my classmates.

But I was just super happy and didn't feel the butterfly like feeling in my chest, when the previous night I did. Sorry to drag it out but basically i wanted to ask if this has happened to anyone else or if it's a sign I'm not actually trans. \nThanks for reading this merp."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Just some questions (questioning my gender)', 'created': 1600371130.0}"

2020-09-18 13:51:35,iv6g5g,3,1,"Hi people of r/trans! I hope you’re all having a nice morning, day, evening :)

A little background before I want to ask my questions: I’m a 20yo cis woman, I was raised in a left wing household, my mum taught my brother and I to always be accepting to people who were trans, homosexual, ... she even told us growing up „if you somehow don’t feel at home in your body and want to change yourself, remember I‘ll always love you.“ It was nice growing up in a home where we could talk about things like that.

Lately I see more and more posts about trans people (I don’t know why? Doesn’t bother me though) and I realized I want to understand the „culture“(?) more. **Disclaimer**: the questions I‘m going to ask are in no way meant to feel like an attack towards you, I‘m genuinely interested and curious.

1) How does it feel for you to realize you were not born in the right body?

2) How do you make the physical changes? Like what is the process? Eg do you start by taking hormones or sometimes go straight to surgery?

3) How does impact you psychologically? Ie knowing you want to change

4) Can you explain why it isn‘t a choice? I understand you were born in the wrong body, but changing is a choice you make, right?

5) There was a girl in my high school when I was about 14, she totally looked like a woman but openly told everyone that she was born a man (thought it was pretty cool of her being so confident sharing that with everyone) and the first few months she still had her male name, but then changed it. How do you choose a new name? It sounds so difficult.

6) When you make the physical transition, do you then go all the way? 

7) I‘ve heard of this trans man a few years back who kept his womb to bear his own children, and to a cis people like my friends and I that seemed kind of strange. He also ended up getting pregnant and giving birth successfully.
What are your views on that?

8) I‘ve also heard of cases where someone did a full transition, regretted it, and wanted to change back. Doesn’t that take a huge toll on the body? Also, how can you regret it? Ie I can understand regretting a tattoo, but transitioning is a long process isn’t it? How can you regret something you were so sure about?

9) What are your views on right wing sayings considering children like „How can a child grow up with a parent that changed it sex?“

2020-09-18 17:11:03,iva6je,2,2,"sorry for the long post! i have a lot of feelings ;~;

tw: sex, assault

hi friends,

i’ve been transitioning for about 3 years and was amab. i’ve mostly been attracted to masculine people and before transitioning i had only had sex with cis gay men and a trans man. since college and especially after transitioning my mind was opened to how fluid sexuality can be if you question your inherited assumptions and let it flow~

i’m in my first lesbian relationship with a cis woman (yes, she’s a butch lol). i love her with alllll my heart. we’ve been dating for a bit and we’re still smitten despite some hard conversations here and there. the sex in the first couple of months was great and often, but even then i had to throw myself into the moment to get it on sometimes because my sex drive isn’t the same since taking estrogen. it’s been harder for me to get into sex and stay aroused in general.

then we had a moment that kind of triggered/reminded me of some old sexual trauma and since then our sex hasn’t been the same. it’s been difficult for me to get out of my head during sex, get/stay hard, or event want to have sex. i’m at the point of wondering if i’m attracted more to cis/trans men because that’s the porn i’ve been having an easier time getting off on. that along some other intrusive thoughts have led me to ask for help (e.g. “maybe i should have bottom surgery” even tho i’ve always loved my equipment, “do i need to end this beautiful relationship even tho i really don’t want to”, “ugh do i have to go back to dating cis men!?!”*)

so i have some questions (and yes i’m doing sex therapy, i’m honestly looking more for shared experiences):
- have you experienced anything like this? or any aspect of this?
- how have you gotten through things like this? any specific practices, books, mindsets, etc.?

also this is my first time ever posting and i’m pretty new to reddit in general, so any feedback on structure (or if this is the wrong place to post this!) is welcome lol.

I am a law student from Rutgers - Camden who has been advocating for change in New Jersey law that would ease transition for individuals in New Jersey as far as gender affirming name changes and gender markers. This week the Supreme Court of New Jersey proposed a change in the rules that would remove the requirement for newspaper publication. For anyone who has not applied for a name change or your state doesn't require this step - New Jersey requires applicants to publish in the newspaper twice - once before their hearing and once after their hearing - notice that they are applying for a name change. The practice is super outdated and the reasoning for it is too (I.e. inform creditors that one's name has changed and you're not just trying to give them the slip). I don't think I need to spell it out for ya'll but this can be a super traumatic part of the transition process for some (i.e. using deadnames, publicizing a transition, using the wrong pronouns, etc).   


Here's where we need your help! This is just a proposed change; there's still a chance it won't happen. The court will be collecting comments until October 14th. Comments are just people sending a note (doesn't have to be super formal, you can use your preferred name even if it's not your legal name) saying how they feel about this change. If you have time between now and October 14th, please consider sending a comment to the Supreme Court of New Jersey showing support of this change and stressing the importance of respecting one's privacy throughout the process of a gender affirming name change petition and encouraging New Jersey to move towards more trans-friendly policies.   


Here's the official note from the court: [https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200916a.pdf?c=4eo](https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200916a.pdf?c=4eo)

That was great enough, but the reason I posted this here is because I requested a mentor with some kind of exposure to the LGBTQIA+ community. My mentor has “LGBTQ+” on his Twitter profile and his pronouns are listed as “he/him or they/them.”

I told him I'm nonbinary, and asked whether he is. He said no, it's just that those are the possible pronouns he answers to.

He also said that he's pansexual, as is his wife, and also that his sister is transgender.

I told him I'm on HRT — doesn't really matter to the mentorship, but I said I'm comfortable with him knowing, and he said he's happy that I do. 👍🏻

I'm identifying as a trans man and I'm planning to come out soon and start physical transition. However, I don't feel like I'm going to change my name. My name is not very feminine but its used for girls only and I haven't seen it to be used for boys. Would it be weird for people to see I'm using a ""feminine"" name but identifying as a male? I really tried to find a new name for myself but all of them felt wrong for me. I don't feel dysphoric with my name and I don't believe in giving gender labels to names but I'm afraid that my name would make things harder in the future because people would assume I'm female by my name and I will need to explain to them that I'm not female.

I'm pretty much masculine looking and feeling more like being male but the pressure of not wanting to change my name makes me to think that maybe I'm nonbinary. I'm really confused. On the one hand, I want to be straight-cis passing male, and on the other hand, I don't want to change my feminine name.

After so many stealth years spent convincing myself that correcting the little things--hair, weight, voice, wardrobe, etc.--should take immediate priority over uncloseting myself and requesting hrt, the fact of my age has finally hit me. I know I'm still young (as my therapist keeps telling me), but the thought that estrogen's effects won't be fully developed and ffs won't be feasible until I'm 22 whole years old is obliterating me. A few times a day, I'll just be trying to read or write or escape into YouTube and I'll think about how many months I'll have to wait, and upon that thought, my head gets heavy and suddenly what I want most of everything in the universe is to scream until night subsumes day.  
Worst of all, I know I'm cleared for hormones. I've taken and passed the blood tests and the wellness screenings. I've filed my consent form. All I need is for my doctor to authorize my prescription, but because of the virus, my appointment options are severely limited. My next appointment with her is more than a month from today, and that was the earliest option. And then what happens after that? Can I stop by my clinic that very day for testosterone blockers or will I have to wait on *yet another* video consultation with *yet another* doctor (I swear I've been through no fewer than a dozen of these).  
I mean no offense to those who no doubt have it harder than me, who can't take hormones or who have no hope at all for ffs (the procedure being as expensive as it is), but god I'm desperate. A month, maybe two, before T-blockers; two more months until estrogen; god knows how many more months until results. By then I'm 22 and physically the same as I am now. I would give anything to cut down the wait. The question I have for anyone willing to help is: given that my body has been judged safe for hrt, shouldn't it be okay for me to pursue buying T-blockers online to get a head-start on taking them before I get my prescription officially, and, if so, can anyone recommend a place to find them (if that's okay to answer)? I could shave a month or more off the medical process of my transition. Looking at pictures of me from a year ago compared to pictures of me now has me really scared for what testosterone will do to me if I wait any longer.

Since I came out and started working towards transitioning, my mental health has for the first time in my life actually improved. I am not transitioning yet, but preparing it, coming out and just accepting and openly ""becoming"" trans made my life already so much better. 

My problem now is that I used to play games about 95% of my free time, just because it was the easiest way to escape reality. Now that I am doing better and don't need to depend on that anymore, gaming on my own all the time just bores me out of my mind and I wish I could be much more social.
Problem is that I don't pass in any way so I'd get gendered as my gender at birth. Which would send my mental health right back down.

I am a woman with gender neutral characteristics. This is a huge part of my identity and my life because I cannot escape being the target of violence for who I am. I am currently undergoing Estrogen HRT and want surgery in the future if I can ever afford it. I hate walking over bridges. I hate looking down from great heights. I can only think of falling and panic consumes everything.  


I suffer from PTSD that comes from my former self, who I think of as father, jumping off an overpass and breaking this body's pelvis. I consider this the moment that my soul was born into this world. I was born screaming beneath the white sun with the blood-red halo closing in and the purple cold following close behind. Symphonies of pain reverberated through ripped flesh, with my tubes and wires and sacs all mangled.  


The saviors in white brought me back to life. I worship medicine, and the Surgeon God who saves us from death and entombment. I remember the hours of total collapse of self. It was like giving birth and I walk with a shuddering limp now. My father was a crazy person. He was so literal, and so beautiful. He transcended self and God so loved him that I, his only daughter, well and truly was born in that time.  


I, three faces of Eve, would have to be safe inside a body that was undesirable and strange to me, cowering and no longer able to play or stretch my arms, for 10 years before I could show myself and exist. He knew what the world would do to me if I came out too soon. I'm scared to go out alone at night. It's a miracle I have my Howard to keep me safe.  


My father lingered for several years, but slowly he died. He wanted to die and find rest somewhere else. I have to let his friends, lovers, and comrades mourn. He is safe now. I have faith in this. He is in peace.  


As a parting gift, a coming of age gift, he gave me, his only daughter, his body which was his only true possession. He gave this to me to do with it as I would.  


I am left broken and cold with the result of what he did, and now he is gone and he can't tell me I'm beautiful anymore. I lash out in loneliness but walk forward with a strength in my heart that was lit there by him. His ghost descends sometimes from the ceiling when I'm half asleep. I think he holds me for a while as I drift to sleep and sings me lullabies and tells me stories like I remember. I have them all now. Like old VHS tapes.  


But he's gone now. I have his body. This precious body that he gave me to be myself in, and reshape into something I recognize in the mirror. It came complete with a bank of out-of-context memories, fading from disuse like they were stored in an attic. He gave me all his memories and experiences and perspectives and all his precious things and all his shames and regrets. I have them all now. I keep them close to my heart. I weep in shame when in anger and hurt I break some of his old things. It just hurts so much sometimes.  


People hate the myth of pygmalion, but my pygmalion truly did render life from death itself. He is my fungal God and he holds me forever. I will be reunited with him beyond the stars. My Howard and my mothers and fathers and lovers and comrades and everyone will be there and I'll awaken in Elysium a woman all in orange and white, greeting a magnificent sunrise with the flash of warm and ecstatic recognition and reunion. I have faith that this will be. Death is intolerable without something that loves us and saves us and takes us somewhere good and right and beautiful.

This precious body that he gave me to be myself in, and reshape into something I recognize in the mirror. It came complete with a bank of out-of-context memories, fading from disuse like they were stored in an attic. He gave me all his memories and experiences and perspectives and all his precious things and all his shames and regrets. I have them all now. I keep them close to my heart. I weep in shame when in anger and hurt I break some of his old things. It just hurts so much sometimes.  \n\n\nPeople hate the myth of pygmalion, but my pygmalion truly did render life from death itself. He is my fungal God and he holds me forever. I will be reunited with him beyond the stars. My Howard and my mothers and fathers and lovers and comrades and everyone will be there and I'll awaken in Elysium a woman all in orange and white, greeting a magnificent sunrise with the flash of warm and ecstatic recognition and reunion. I have faith that this will be. Death is intolerable without something that loves us and saves us and takes us somewhere good and right and beautiful. I can't stand the endless cup of sadness that is human life and human death. Love is infinite hurt."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""i live in my father's old body"", 'created': 1600600763.0}"

2020-09-21 08:29:59,iwwhtk,2,1,"I was born biologically male in 2006, so I am only 14 and I still have a lot to figure out. Growing up, I showed no signs of being trans that I am aware of, even though I have not asked my parents because I am afraid and they are like borderline conservative Christians so I ain't tryna be too sus. I grew up in a house with both of my parents and my older brother and all the toys you'd expect a little boy to have, and I was happy and content with this. Then from 2nd to 4th grade, I was homeschooled and I didn't really have any friends so that was kinda a blank period in my social development per say. My only social interaction was when my family would visit my extended family and around the age of 8 is probably when I'd say I began to show interest in more feminine things. My grandma had a lot of dress up stuff and I liked to wear the wigs and heels, but since I've always been more of a follower, I just excepted that that was just me being a weirdo and went on to play with need guns with my brother and be a normal boy and do boy stuff... Y'know. I enjoyed putting on those heels and that wig, but I tried to hide it, because even from a young age, I could tell that it was ""wrong"" for me to like those things. Now, 5th grade is when things really got weird for me... I listened to a lot of one direction at the time and this may seem like a weird thing to point out and it may just be me being nit picky, but whenever I listed to ""Beautiful"" by my One Direction, I would always picture myself as the girl that he was singing about. I could identify with that shy girl who wasn't aware that she was beautiful, and at the time, I loved that song, but I didn't really know what it was about it. That's around when I thought ""I might be gay"", so I went on a long quest of self discovery and now, 9th grade me believes that I am infact pansexual and possibly transgender. During that 5th grade year I also had another strange event that had really stuck with me for awhile. My mom was painting my sister's nails and jokingly asked me if I wanted her to paint mine. I don't think she expected me to eagerly say yes, but I did... She only painted one nail with clear nail polish, which was kinda disappointing, but I overheard my dad talking to her about how he's ""afraid of how I'm gonna turn out"" and that has really stuck with me. I don't know if that was in reference to me coming out as gay or trans in the future, but that one statement has stuck with me and I wasn't even supposed to hear it. My dad also says he'd be fine if any of us came out as gay, but then he constantly calls people ""f*ggots"" and if a man has his hair up in a bun he calls it a ""tw*t knot"", so he's kinda sending mixed signals. He also said that if any of his kids ever come out as trans, he would disown them and kick them out of the house. It doesn't help that in the past few months I've been thinking about me gender identity a lot more and I think I may even be experiencing gender dysphoria, but all I have is other people's explanations of what gender dysphoria is, and I know it affects people differently, but I find myself almost obsessing over the idea of being a female and I feel like my dad's and my brother's transphobic comments have just increased in number. But even just holding a blanket over myself and pretending it is a dress just makes me happy and makes me wanna just dance around and enjoy what little childhood I have left. I have also been experimenting with the name Autumn and using she/her pronouns for myself, but I have not socially transitioned or came out to anyone, because A) I'm not even sure if I'm trans B) I'm afraid.

Don't Know What to do From Here.,1600702199.0,"{'created_utc': 1600676999, 'id': 'iwwhtk', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I was born biologically male in 2006, so I am only 14 and I still have a lot to figure out. Growing up, I showed no signs of being trans that I am aware of, even though I have not asked my parents because I am afraid and they are like borderline conservative Christians so I ain\'t tryna be too sus. I grew up in a house with both of my parents and my older brother and all the toys you\'d expect a little boy to have, and I was happy and content with this. Then from 2nd to 4th grade, I was homeschooled and I didn\'t really have any friends so that was kinda a blank period in my social development per say. My only social interaction was when my family would visit my extended family and around the age of 8 is probably when I\'d say I began to show interest in more feminine things. My grandma had a lot of dress up stuff and I liked to wear the wigs and heels, but since I\'ve always been more of a follower, I just excepted that that was just me being a weirdo and went on to play with need guns with my brother and be a normal boy and do boy stuff... Y\'know. I enjoyed putting on those heels and that wig, but I tried to hide it, because even from a young age, I could tell that it was ""wrong"" for me to like those things. Now, 5th grade is when things really got weird for me... I listened to a lot of one direction at the time and this may seem like a weird thing to point out and it may just be me being nit picky, but whenever I listed to ""Beautiful"" by my One Direction, I would always picture myself as the girl that he was singing about. I could identify with that shy girl who wasn\'t aware that she was beautiful, and at the time, I loved that song, but I didn\'t really know what it was about it. That\'s around when I thought ""I might be gay"", so I went on a long quest of self discovery and now, 9th grade me believes that I am infact pansexual and possibly transgender. During that 5th grade year I also had another strange event that had really stuck with me for awhile. My mom was painting my sister\'s nails and jokingly asked me if I wanted her to paint mine. I don\'t think she expected me to eagerly say yes, but I did... She only painted one nail with clear nail polish, which was kinda disappointing, but I overheard my dad talking to her about how he\'s ""afraid of how I\'m gonna turn out"" and that has really stuck with me. I don\'t know if that was in reference to me coming out as gay or trans in the future, but that one statement has stuck with me and I wasn\'t even supposed to hear it. My dad also says he\'d be fine if any of us came out as gay, but then he constantly calls people ""f*ggots"" and if a man has his hair up in a bun he calls it a ""tw*t knot"", so he\'s kinda sending mixed signals. He also said that if any of his kids ever come out as trans, he would disown them and kick them out of the house. It doesn\'t help that in the past few months I\'ve been thinking about me gender identity a lot more and I think I may even be experiencing gender dysphoria, but all I have is other people\'s explanations of what gender dysphoria is, and I know it affects people differently, but I find myself almost obsessing over the idea of being a female and I feel like my dad\'s and my brother\'s transphobic comments have just increased in number. But even just holding a blanket over myself and pretending it is a dress just makes me happy and makes me wanna just dance around and enjoy what little childhood I have left. I have also been experimenting with the name Autumn and using she/her pronouns for myself, but I have not socially transitioned or came out to anyone, because A) I\'m not even sure if I\'m trans B) I\'m afraid.

2020-09-21 19:36:15,ix7jyf,0,1,"Today I left work; I packed up my things, turned the computer off, locked my door and walked out of the building. I left work, for the last time being a pre-op trans woman. As I walked down the hallway, I thought back to the many many times where I would be sitting in my classroom, waiting to go home so I could “dress-up” and express myself, freely. I thought about the times I would sit in an empty room, and just think about where my life was headed and how unhappy I was in the body I was currently in. I would look on Reddit and Instagram and see all of these girls “living authentically”, yet there I would sit, alone and empty...

But.

Today I left work; I left work as myself. I left work presenting as the woman I am; and have been (to my coworkers) since coming out back in June.
I left work with an incredible feeling.
I left work with the absolute assurance that I had the love and support of every person in that building. I can’t explain to you the amount of “hey tori, we will be thinking about you and praying for you tomorrow” or “we can’t wait! We are so excited for you!” that I’ve received today as well as the weeks leading up to tomorrow.

We. We as in, my loving and supporting coworkers on staff. WE are excited for you. WE are happy for you. WE love you. WE support you.

Today I left work; knowing and feeling that love and support. An absolutely indescribable moment.

But I know this isn’t the narrative. I know this isn’t reality for many of my trans brothers and sisters. I know the lot of us are treated differently, exiled, or even fired from our current place of employment...and that’s the narrative. Most often, the general story is negative, when someone starts living authentically - and that’s the sad world we find ourselves fighting to live in.

However, there is hope. I share my story with you all not to “flex” or “brag” but to share that there IS light and there IS love, out there. I share my story to encourage those struggling; I share my story to give insight into the life of a transwoman who isn’t rich or famous, but has the undeniable love and support of her colleagues. 
There is hope.

2020-09-22 06:17:16,ixi1bn,9,1,"Hi everyone. I have a child that was AFAB and has been living as male for nearly 2 years now. I hope I’m in the right sub for this and I know this is long so if you don’t want to read so much, there is a TL;DR at the bottom. 

To begin, my son is turning 12 at the end of the month (Sept 27). A few months ago, he started puberty and it was so traumatic for both of us. He cried and I cried and it was so hard. It hurt me so much to see him in pain and I knew then that I’d do anything to take that pain away. I was just not ready for this to happen so soon. I didn’t start mine until I was almost 17 so I thought he had plenty of time. I immediately found him a therapist and he’s now into his third one that he’s been seeing for a few months (the first two didn’t work out but this one seems to be going well I think). And recently she told us that he is okay to start puberty blockers (yayy) so I’ve been trying to find a pediatric endocrinologist that can get him started. I hate to watch him go through this horrible experience and it makes me feel so terrible for him. I hope to get him on the puberty blockers asap, especially with his birthday around the corner. Speaking of which, I want to do something special for him because the last few years have been very difficult between his father and I splitting (after years of fighting and me putting up with his abuse). I made the decision to leave and moved my son and I 3 hours drive away from there. My son knows his dad is a band person and he doesn’t really even want to see him. He’s very protective of me and couldn’t stand seeing me being abused. There’s been so much pain and suffering in our lives and I really want this to be a special birthday for him. So any ideas are welcome. I can’t seem to get anything out of him. He won’t ask for much because he knows I don’t have much and he doesn’t want to stress me out but I keep telling him that money isn’t an issue and this birthday is going to be special whether he likes it or not. So I’m kind of on my own trying to figure out what I can do with him that will make it special. 

Anyway, moving on from that, I guess I’m here because I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. I love my son more than anything in the world and he’s the most amazing person I know. He is just so smart, kind, and brave; he’s just such an amazing kid. He calls his cycle his “man period.” Which I don’t know where he for that from but I love it. And yet, I have so many things that worry me. I know he’s strong and he can handle almost anything. I just want to do whatever I can to help. I grew up in a family that was very homophobic and made me feel terrible about who I was. I want to make sure my son doesn’t ever have to experience the shame, humiliation, and depression that my own family put me through. 

My mom says that it’s somehow my fault that I made him think he’s a boy because I’m so open about being pansexual and about my own struggles with my gender identity. I don’t really identify as either gender and I’ve been using the label non-binary for now. I’m still figuring it out. I changed my name a long time ago because I hated my birth name, it was too feminine and it just didn’t fit me. I use a more gender neutral name now, Lee. But my parents refuse to call me by that name even though I’ve been using it for close to 15 years now and they’re the only ones who call me my birth name, which I hate and it has a lot of trauma attached to it. I’m sure you all can understand that. 

I also caused a lot of drama when I named my baby Elliot (I chose that name after having an ultrasound and being told I was having a girl). My entire family hated it and I had people literally coming at me with lists of alternative more feminine names (like Ella or Ellen and similar) and berating me for choosing a “boys name” for my female baby. But I didn’t care and I refused to budge. I just loved the name so much and now I’m so glad I didn’t give in because people have thought Elliot was a boy from the very beginning. For the first few years I was constantly having to correct people when they thought my baby was a boy and I thought I had a girl and of course he was too young to tell us yet. On top of the whole name thing, it bothered my family that I let my kid play with all kinds of toys and wear all kinds of different clothes. I never believed that toys and clothes should be gendered so I always just let my kid play with whatever he wanted and dressed him in a variety of clothing from both sides of the store because if I liked something then I got it and it never mattered to me if it was labeled for boys or girls. My kid played with dolls and kitchen sets and also cars and tool kits and so on. Whatever he liked, I let him have. I know that none of that made him trans. I know he was born that way and I believe him when he says he’s a boy. I’ve had a feeling for awhile because he used to tell me that he liked when people referred to him as male and as he got old enough to choose his own style, he would always ask me to get him boy clothes and to let him cut his hair shorter and shorter every time. And I always felt my job was not to dictate how he dressed or what he played with but to just let him express himself however he wanted. He came out to me officially when he was 10 and I was scared at first because I felt like he was too young. But I also never doubted him for a second and I know that he is sure about who he is. I’m so proud of him because he’s so strong and so smart. 

About a year ago, he said that if he could have just one wish, he would wish that he was a boy. I cried. But I knew for sure that he was a boy and I would do anything to help him be himself. His happiness is all that matters to me. A few months later, he decided he wanted to come out to the family and even to people at school. Most of the kids at school thought he was a boy already because he looks like a boy. Fortunately, his teachers and counselors were very supportive and kind and they even let him use the one gender neutral bathroom in the office because he was afraid to use the boys bathroom or the girls. That helped a lot. 

The scariest part for me was coming out to my parents. I knew they wouldn’t be so open. My mom still thinks he is “way too young to make this kind of decision” (she doesn’t understand that it isn’t a choice) and she’s told me that I’m pushing him in the wrong direction because I’m encouraging him by allowing him to dress how he wants and helping to get him put on puberty blockers. I know that is total nonsense and I’m not going to listen to anything she says. It just bugs me so much. She misgenders him a lot but I make a point to correct her every time and it’s actually gotten better lately. She is starting to use male pronouns more now and I’m going to keep correcting her if she slips up. At this point I’m giving her the benefit of the doubt and just trying to teach her that being trans or gay or whatever is not a choice anymore than her being straight and cis is a choice for her. I’m so proud of my son for everything he’s helped me achieve, for being brave and helping me to open up the minds and hearts of my family. I honestly never thought they’d accept him and even though it hasn’t been easy, it’s not as bad as I expected it would be. 

So I guess I am here for some advice and maybe also some stories from some of you. If it’s not too hard to share, I would love to hear what your experiences were like. And for those who had negative experiences, what is something you wish your parent or other loved ones had done or said to make your coming out and/or your transition easier? What do you wish they would say or do now that would make you feel more validated? The reason I ask this is because I want to make sure I do the right things and help my son feel proud to be himself and show him that I’m always on his side no matter what. 

I’m willing to do anything to make my son’s life easier. I know he will deal with some bad stuff and that I can’t protect him forever. So I want to prepare him for that. At the same time, I want him to see that there are plenty of good people in the world too, who will love and respect him for who he is. I want to show him that he’s not alone and that he’s loved and respected. 

I’m sorry for the long rant and I hope that I didn’t break any rules here. I just have been wanting to reach out to others for so long. I’ve been wanting to hear stories, experiences, and advice. So that I can be the best parent I possibly can be for my son. Because especially now I am all he has (and he is all I have). He struggles to make friends. A lot of that is my fault because we have moved so many times. And having to start middle school online isn’t helping. It’s been him and me for a long time now but the last few months we’ve been just the two of us at home all day every day because of the pandemic. 

I struggle with mental illness myself and I left his father because he was abusive. I had to move away from him for my own sanity and to start a better life for my son and myself. I wish I could get him to talk to someone but he has a hard time opening up fully and I never want to press him on anything because I don’t want to cause him any pain. I just want him to be happy. 

So if you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice or stories or anything to share with me, I will be eternally grateful. 

If I posted this in the wrong place, I’m so sorry; please let me know and I’ll remove it. If you can point me in the right direction then I’ll go there. I just didn’t know where to turn. Life has not been easy for us. I know it’s been hard for so many people. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. I look forward to reading your responses. Thank you so much in advance. You are amazing people and I love you all.

On top of the whole name thing, it bothered my family that I let my kid play with all kinds of toys and wear all kinds of different clothes. I never believed that toys and clothes should be gendered so I always just let my kid play with whatever he wanted and dressed him in a variety of clothing from both sides of the store because if I liked something then I got it and it never mattered to me if it was labeled for boys or girls. My kid played with dolls and kitchen sets and also cars and tool kits and so on. Whatever he liked, I let him have. I know that none of that made him trans. I know he was born that way and I believe him when he says he’s a boy. I’ve had a feeling for awhile because he used to tell me that he liked when people referred to him as male and as he got old enough to choose his own style, he would always ask me to get him boy clothes and to let him cut his hair shorter and shorter every time. And I always felt my job was not to dictate how he dressed or what he played with but to just let him express himself however he wanted. He came out to me officially when he was 10 and I was scared at first because I felt like he was too young. But I also never doubted him for a second and I know that he is sure about who he is. I’m so proud of him because he’s so strong and so smart. \n\nAbout a year ago, he said that if he could have just one wish, he would wish that he was a boy. I cried. But I knew for sure that he was a boy and I would do anything to help him be himself. His happiness is all that matters to me. A few months later, he decided he wanted to come out to the family and even to people at school. Most of the kids at school thought he was a boy already because he looks like a boy. Fortunately, his teachers and counselors were very supportive and kind and they even let him use the one gender neutral bathroom in the office because he was afraid to use the boys bathroom or the girls. That helped a lot. \n\nThe scariest part for me was coming out to my parents. I knew they wouldn’t be so open. My mom still thinks he is “way too young to make this kind of decision” (she doesn’t understand that it isn’t a choice) and she’s told me that I’m pushing him in the wrong direction because I’m encouraging him by allowing him to dress how he wants and helping to get him put on puberty blockers. I know that is total nonsense and I’m not going to listen to anything she says. It just bugs me so much. She misgenders him a lot but I make a point to correct her every time and it’s actually gotten better lately. She is starting to use male pronouns more now and I’m going to keep correcting her if she slips up. At this point I’m giving her the benefit of the doubt and just trying to teach her that being trans or gay or whatever is not a choice anymore than her being straight and cis is a choice for her. I’m so proud of my son for everything he’s helped me achieve, for being brave and helping me to open up the minds and hearts of my family. I honestly never thought they’d accept him and even though it hasn’t been easy, it’s not as bad as I expected it would be. \n\nSo I guess I am here for some advice and maybe also some stories from some of you. If it’s not too hard to share, I would love to hear what your experiences were like. And for those who had negative experiences, what is something you wish your parent or other loved ones had done or said to make your coming out and/or your transition easier? What do you wish they would say or do now that would make you feel more validated? The reason I ask this is because I want to make sure I do the right things and help my son feel proud to be himself and show him that I’m always on his side no matter what. \n\nI’m willing to do anything to make my son’s life easier. I know he will deal with some bad stuff and that I can’t protect him forever. So I want to prepare him for that. At the same time, I want him to see that there are plenty of good people in the world too, who will love and respect him for who he is. I want to show him that he’s not alone and that he’s loved and respected. \n\nI’m sorry for the long rant and I hope that I didn’t break any rules here. I just have been wanting to reach out to others for so long. I’ve been wanting to hear stories, experiences, and advice. So that I can be the best parent I possibly can be for my son. Because especially now I am all he has (and he is all I have). He struggles to make friends. A lot of that is my fault because we have moved so many times. And having to start middle school online isn’t helping. It’s been him and me for a long time now but the last few months we’ve been just the two of us at home all day every day because of the pandemic. \n\nI struggle with mental illness myself and I left his father because he was abusive. I had to move away from him for my own sanity and to start a better life for my son and myself. I wish I could get him to talk to someone but he has a hard time opening up fully and I never want to press him on anything because I don’t want to cause him any pain. I just want him to be happy. \n\nSo if you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice or stories or anything to share with me, I will be eternally grateful. \n\nIf I posted this in the wrong place, I’m so sorry; please let me know and I’ll remove it. If you can point me in the right direction then I’ll go there. I just didn’t know where to turn. Life has not been easy for us. I know it’s been hard for so many people. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. I look forward to reading your responses. Thank you so much in advance. You are amazing people and I love you all.\n\nTL;DR: My young child (AFAB) came out as trans and I want to be as supportive as possible and make life easier, better, and happier for him. I’d love to hear your stories, experiences, advice, etc. Thank you.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My son is trans and he’s the best thing in my life.', 'created': 1600780636.0}"

2020-09-22 18:26:59,ixt674,1,1,"Hello everyone. I am not transgender myself but my partner might be so I hope it's okay for me to post here!

A background: My partner is assigned male at birth. In his youth he often thought about transitioning and felt like it could be the right way for him. However he lived in a small, very Catholic city and the people there aren't very accepting around these topics. So he pushed those thoughts away because he felt like it's impossible for him to really live up to that.
Right before the Corona crisis started he moved in with me in a different area of our country. My city has lots of students and is generally pretty open-minded. So now the topic about being trans came up again and he starts to realise that it might not be as impossible as he originally thought.

He is still in the phase of figuring stuff out. I'm trying the best I can to help him, I have some close friends who are transgender as well and think I have a basic understanding of the topic. I definitely want him to look out for a therapist who is qualified to help him in a professional way, but the waiting lists are really long and it will take months to get an appointment.
We also have a group that is supporting queer people but they are closed due to the Corona crisis.

Soon the university will start and as he is new here and didn't meet many people yet I feel like this would be the perfect time to try some things out and see how it feels. I personally did something similar when I changed my name and it helped so much that nobody knew me before. We already found a female name that feels very comfortable to him. And now comes the point where I hoped that you guys could help me. How can I help him with being perceived as female as possible? He has long hairs already, so that's not a big deal. But when it comes to clothes and makeup I just don't have enough experience. He is pretty tall but thin - what types of clothes can you recommend that we try? What kinds of makeup could be right for him, what should I look out for and how exactly can contouring etc. help to make his face look more female? I rarely use makeup on myself and never did anything with contouring so any tips would be great!

2020-09-22 23:42:02,ixz21x,6,1,"so, recently I've been questioning my gender again, but here's my dilemma:

I'm conflicted because of internalized transphobia and shame about being trans for a long time. I've always felt like I've had to prove myself and I'm currently working through that. I'm realizing that I want to still be perceived mainly as male, but I would probably like having that part where some people might not know. And have more freedom in my mind to express in multiple ways while still presenting mostly male.

The main issue is that now, I'm feeling like I might identify with nonbinary masc and I'm trying to figure out what would be the indicator other than gender expression and dysphoria, or my lack of dysphoria in other areas.

I feel like it's frustrating because being trans isn't a choice, but I know gender identity, and gender expression are two different things. I can be a trans man, and still dress feminine, or androgynously, but on the other hand how would I know if I'm nonbinary masc, or trans male if someone doesn't pay attention to ""signs""? It's conflicting right?

Definitions are so confusing to me because even though gender, and the gender binary are a construction, it's till not a choice. I also feel like gender dysphoria is the medical term to identify how a trans person is trans, and it makes us seem mentally ill, or illegitimate. It shouldn't be a hard science, I feel like social sciences explain it a lot more, and would point more to trans people being valid, and not mentally ill. It also validates the reason why everyone's gender isn't a choice.

So, mainly,

How do I know if I'm nonbinary masc, or trans male who wants to express differently? I feel like gender identity does have a lot to do with expression because it's interconnected, and sometimes is how we identify transness. In reality, our sex and gender are also two different things. **I just have a hard time understanding how I exist, and how I'm valid.** or how I can figure out my identity. Should I just call myself queer because the more educated I am, the more I get frustrated with my identity. Maybe queer is just a better idea, because I shouldn't be constricted by labels? Even though I would like a label or two to attach myself to.

I could list ""signs"" but I also feel like that's enforcing the gender binary. Like, I really feel more comfortable on testosterone, and I want top surgery, but I feel okay about my bottom parts. I have always been masculine leaning, and presenting, but I like mixing ""fem"" or androgynous things into my presentation and my style, and I want to be more of that. It feels right.

Hi. Tbh I'm a little drunk writing this, so I apologized in advance if there are grammar mistakes or if my post makes no sense. Also, just a warning I kinda cuss a lot. lol. Idk how to even start. So, I guess I'll start with a question. How the hell do you tell the difference between being trans and things like, wanting to be a drag queen, cross dresser, etc..... For most of my life I feel like I have been bouncing between thinking I maybe one of those things. Ever time I think I have it pinned down I become really indecisive and my opinion changes. One minute ""I'm pretty sure I'm probably just trans"", a few days later ""maybe it is just a weird fetish"" and few days later ""maybe I just want to be drag queen or some shit"". Now pictures that though process on repeat for that lasts like 15 years of your god damn life. I can honestly say I would not give a single fuck if I was trans. I have frankly lost the ability to give a shit. I just want to know for sure, you know? Or at least go more then a week without doubting myself and changing my opinion. Does anyone understand what I am talking about and maybe have any tips or something like that? Or am I just crazy? Idk what is even compelling me to write this in the middle of the night. I try to avoid thinking about this stuff because it drives me fucking crazy. Most nights I start to think about this, it ends with me just burying my head in my pillow and just stayjng there motionless until I fall asleep (usually takes an hour or two).

To answer some basic questions right out the gate : Biology speaking I'm a male. Yes I have dress like the opposite sex before and it felt comforting, kinda like a hug if that makes any sense (stuff like hoodies, tops, pants, shorts). Also, and this is probably why I am even thinking about this write now, a few days ago a few days ago a complete stranger refered to me as a female pronoun on the phone and it made me feel good/happy? Idk.

Im 19 and I’ve recently been questioning my gender and I think I might be MtF, right after I found out I told my sister and a friend, however since then I’ve been on hold not knowing what to do. Maybe therapy would be the logical next step, and I know my mother would happily allow me to go, the only problem is that... she sucks at keeping secrets, it’s not out of malice it’s just that she gets nervous and slips up at the worst time, and I know the rest of my family won’t easily accept me.

So recently I’ve been closing myself up, I don’t know if it’s out of fear or why, but my emotions are becoming “dry” and I feel like I’m in negation. However when I first found out, a wave of all the bottled up feelings came out (cried all night) so I know it’s not something that came out of nowhere, so I’m afraid about what would happen if I keep on rejecting who I am, however I’m too scared to do anything because of my family and also my country is really bad for anything lgbtq and there’s a lot of female killings or kidnapping.

So that’s why I’m here, asking for advice, what should I do next?

Problem with the second suggestion is first off I’m scared of first off being judged looking ugly, and secondly I don’t want any of my other friends or family to find out since I’m not out of the closet about it. They kept assuming me that it helped them out a lot but idk. \n\nTldr I’m just scared and looking for tips because I don’t know what to do.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I just recently accepted I’m trans.

I wish this weren’t a thing and all restrooms could just be called **Restrooms!!**. 

Maybe the fact that these restrooms are present is enough and maybe I’m overthinking it? We still do a lot of communal restrooms but over the last few years, the bar/restaurant style M/F with stalls has been phased out and most have actual walls/doors with sinks/showers in there or just a toilet/shower with communal rows of sinks.

I haven't been able to hold down a job because of my immediate dysphoria, I am a Leo asking for help isn't something I like doing very often but I even gave that a try and have gotten nowhere, from talking to other trans people, going to counselors/therapists, to making a gofundme. I have almost given up, I want to be free of being an unhappy existing burden to become a beautiful blossoming queen of the jungle.

(or at least thats what they say)

 I want to give them more info about transitioning and trans people. If anyone knowns any resources or what's to share their experience it would be greatly appreciated. 

background on me: (22mtF) 

I've been on hormones for a couple months through a clinic thankfully.

I've been very unsure in a lot of things in my life but for once I known this is my path.

I'm damn sure I'm trans but I'll be seeing a psychiatrist to get a second opinion soon just to calm my parents down, this is mostly my dad

Here's some main issues they have:

the classic ""never shown any signs""

they don't believe I'm 100% sure and don't want me to do permanent ""damage"" 

doesn't understand that people don't just decided this night

My dad thinks most people regret transitioning and thinks that if I see both sides of transitioning I'll change mind? He wants to be convinced himself that I'm definitely trans AF. Also he thinks that it was caused by bullies or some trauma in my childhood, (already said no) Lastly, he thinks that it's weird that I want to transition to a female but I still like girls ????

I already told them that I would go to our psychiatrist covered through our insurance since they want another opinion besides the clinic, which I agreed on

So basically my dad wants to ask a bunch of super specific questions so he knows for sure that I'm 100% and thinks that this is something that you should think about for over a year, I've said that I've questioned for over a year until it finally clicked

bonus: he was like you know most parents kick their kids out for this stuff and you won't talk to me about this in depth, I just want to known for sure because I'm not convinced and blah 

I think he would make a great gatekeeper lmao,

sorry if this post is a mess but I'm pretty happy my true life is beginning lol

I just wanna find the best way to come out."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Help on Coming Out as Trans to my Family', 'created': 1600976680.0}"

""Is it because trans rights and recognician is a big issue and he doesnt know where to place himself in the LGBTQ+ community?""\n\nI really am accepting of him but I dont want to lay it on thick and for him to feel like it is forced. \n\nHe isn\'t changing his pronouns at this moment he just told us and wants it to stay as it is for now he just wanted to tell us.\n\nI work abroad and so right now am not in the same country as my family but any advice at all would be appreciated, sorry if this is the wrong sub i will place it in the correct one if tell me where.\n\nThanks in advance', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Not me but my son', 'created': 1600994310.0}"

There is no ‘easy’ way to say so i’m going to be blunt, i’m trans. I know this can be alot to take in and process but there is no rush, telling you was the next part of my journey and when you’re ready to read on i’m gonna try explain what this means.

I have felt this way for years but suppressed my emotions as I wanted to be ‘normal’, I pushed the thoughts back but I can’t anymore, I have finally accepted that this is who I am and as much as I tried nothing can change it. I remember a few moments from my childhood where I began to have these thoughts and feelings but in the last year or two I have felt more dysphoric than ever. I have begun hating my body and feel the need to begin my transition more than I have ever felt before.

I don’t know how much you know about being trans or what this means so I will try and explain as best I can, however feel free to ask anything as I have found the hardest part for me is saying something for the first time, but then it becomes a normal part of life, whether they accept me or not.

What this means:

* I prefer female presentation clothes, makeup, mannerisms, ect…
* I would prefer female pronouns and although I am not set on a name the friend group who know currently use Delilah or Lila
* I am still your child, just not the son you thought you had

Although my feelings aren’t set in stone they never will be, but I can only begin to explore this if I begin my social transition. I have researched a lot into this and talking to a GP is my planned next step. I have already told Millie and that friend group, who all accept me and allow me to be me. I know it can be hard to accept and process but I hope that this doesn’t change much between us.

In the short term I'd rather you only use my new name and pronouns around those that know, keeping it secret still as I build confidence to tell those that don't. I do plan to tell everyone around me as I would feel better expressing myself as the person I was born to be, however hearing thoughts and views of those around me doesn’t fill me with confidence which is why i’d rather you not say anything.

As of writing this 24/09/2020 I am still unsure when you will see this but hopefully it shall be soon. I am worried that if you don’t accept me then it may affect Christmas, but I also know that I need to tell you soon as the feeling of anxiety and stress is so much.

I hope this is enough information and that I have explained it well, I hope that you will accept me as I am and respect my wish to keep it private as this is such a tough topic to express.

Hi all. I’m not a trans individual, but I am the teacher’s aide for several trans students. Our school is in rural Indiana, but we’re pretty big because we’re next to a larger city. Because of this, I’ve got a really interesting mix of quite conservative and quite liberal students and teachers.

2020-09-26 06:55:39,j019yl,3,1,"I’ve recently been feeling as though my mother is trying to slow my transition process down and force me to wait until I’m 18, when I will just do it myself.

For context, my mom isn’t a very open minded person, and at times can even be racist.

I say that my mom is intentionally trying to slow my transition down because in the past her main concern is that if “something were to happen to me” (I assume she means I detransition) then she would be framed as a bad parent for allowing me to go through with it so early in my life. 

She’s also tried to make me second guess myself and try to change how I feel very subtlety (she doesn’t realize I could tell, but I’m not stupid.)



Recently over the last year I finally thought I’d been breaking through to her and that maybe she was finally starting to understand. We were able to talk openly about it on occasion and she agreed to let me see a professional. 

I started therapy with a therapist who specializes in gender, and she not only confirmed to my mom that it isn’t “just a phase” or “just for attention” as she’s said in the past, and I was even recommended from her to begin looking into starting HRT. 

I told my mother this and did a lot of research into it prior to telling her, including reading an entire 88 page legal doc from my healthcare provider to check for coverage and availability for transgender care. 

I informed her I did this and let her know that our current PCP will not be able to do anything other than refer us elsewhere, most likely to an Endocrinologist, which I also did research into and found the only one in my entire city that takes our insurance is 18+ only, and that instead I would like to go to planned parenthood since they have a different procedure and don’t require you to be 18. 


I was then told the next day that I had an appointment with my PCP, and not planned parenthood like I had recommended. I assumed this was just because she was more familiar with it, and wanted to start somewhere she knew, which is understandable.

So yesterday morning comes and I drive with her to my appointment, in the car ride there she had a talk with me that mainly consisted of her telling me that she doesn’t feel like I’m old enough to be making this decision.

We get to the doctors office and the appointment goes exactly how I told her it would. “They won’t be able to do anything, and they’re just going to refer us elsewhere” low and behold, they referred us elsewhere...

To the only endocrinologist in my city...

Who is 18+ only.



At this point I feel like I can’t keep denying it, it’s very clear to me she’s trying to force me to wait until I’m 18 to do this on my own so she doesn’t have to bear the burden if something doesn’t go as intended. Not only did she completely ignore what I said to her about what would happen with our PCP, she insists that I don’t go to planned parenthood because “I don’t want to go into a crowded hospital” despite us doing exactly that today, as well as the fact that it took her nearly a year just to get me with a therapist that is knowledgable on the subject.



I can understand her being scared, as a parent it’s scary for your child to go under such a severe change and if she would just say that, I’d be less upset. What really upsets me is that I’m being led on thinking that things are going to get better for me, and setting my expectations to a standard that they’re not going to meet. It feels like I’m being lied to just to be appeased and it really hurts.

2020-09-26 07:52:30,j01yz9,0,1,"When I first came to this subreddit I had no idea what gender dysphoria was. I didn’t even know I had it until I read an explanation which explained all of my feelings. 

My whole life people have told me I was good looking. I seriously have no idea what they’re talking about. I still don’t. I hated that I was a boy who could never be a man. I tried so hard to be a man. I had to fight every natural tendency. I had a system, to make sure I did all of the most manly things! Yet I could never grow a beard, or have the muscle mass growth that I should a man should have. I didn’t know I hated myself at the time, all I knew is that I need work. 

Coming here made me realize that I didn’t have to be a man! I never wanted to be a man. The more I tore down my worldview of what was expected of me the more I realized that I was naturally primed to be a girl. That system that I designed was a system of suppressing all of the girl inside of me and faking a man.

For my FFS, they gave me disposable paper panties so that i could cover up going into my op. I felt that was a REALLY thoughtful gesture and as soon as i was aware i could put them on, it dropped my stress levels enormously.

I was born a male, and in my early childhood I started to have more feminine tendencies, doing things traditionally meant for girls and feeling comfortable doing it. That kind of got my family to laugh at me so I learned that doing that was an easy way to get ridiculed. I suppressed that and just went with the story of being a guy my whole life. I would on occasion have these dysphoric episodes where I seriously question what I am, but I would always push the thoughts away and ignore my feelings. I wouldn’t say I really identified with anything when suppressing my feelings, more so I just used the labels of a man and didn’t think about how I felt for most of my teenage years. Around when I was 17 and 18, the feelings would come back and they would stick around for long periods of time. Questioning my identity, my body feeling wrong, how I felt about myself. After a few weeks I would suppress and ignore my feelings and just go along as it I felt nothing at all. This would happen for the next few years, and now I’m here at 21. After expressing my feelings to some of my friends who are trans they told me I should confront my feelings and start exploring what makes me comfortable. Since doing it my dysphoria has gotten worse, but I’ve also had moments where I’m much happier. I’ve been using female pronouns for a month and a different name. I wear women’s clothes when I’m not working, so mostly at home but on occasion I go for walks. When I am working I have to use my first dead name(I have two) and use male pronouns because I’m afraid of what some coworkers will say or think. Being forced into a situation where I’m using both male and female pronouns has had an incredible impact on my mind and it just makes me feel doubtful and uncomfortable. When I’m not feeling dysphoric I feel just whatever about my body. I don’t love it. I have to shave every day because the facial hair just is really not making me happy, I’ve shaved a lot of my body hair because that’s something that always bothered me. In trying to understand myself I look at what questions people ask and what stories are told. I found some people saying experiences similar to mine are just not valid which makes me feel incredible doubt about myself, and I already deal with doubt fairly often because I’m doing something I suppressed, and ignored for a long time while also challenging everything I was told that I am.

Because I’m among the 27 million or so uninsured Americans, not to mention my location, my choices were considerably circumscribed. Just the same, I managed to find a provider who said they had someone in-house with experience in Trans mental health. 

Yesterday, during my intake interview, I found out the therapist’s name. This morning, I did a brief search and came up with what, to me at least, is a disturbing fact. 

My therapist got their degrees (BA &amp; MA) from Liberty University (a/k/a Jerry Falwell U). This is the same institution that preaches that Trans is “sin,” that “male and female created He them” (and there’s no middle ground), that the entirety of the LGBTQ population is hell-bound, denies Evolution, and expels it’s students for being any thing but 1,000,000% Hetero. 

Are my fears justified? Is it possible this person could spend all that time in that atmosphere and somehow still be caring and open to the Trans population?

2020-09-26 17:37:39,j0aaps,1,1,"Hi all! Just hoping someone can help me out here as it’s been messing with my head for a while.

So I’m mid twenties and born male. Just recently got into my first serious relationship with a girl. However, when we are intimate the only way I can finish is if I imagine myself as the girl. I’ve tried so many times thinking I’m the guy and it just doesn’t work. Obviously this has me asking the question as to whether it’s deeper than say a fetish.

A bit of background. I’ve always wanted to be a girl since puberty really. Never really acted on it other than in lockdown where I started to experiment with dressing up and toys etc. Tbh I completely felt my true self and relaxed then.

Now I live my girlfriend too so I don’t really have anywhere for my other side to come out. Think it is taking a toll mentally as I don’t feel myself and I’m slightly depressed.

Be interest to here anyone’s thoughts on this please?

If you're a trans person, non binary person, or someone who goes by a different name or pronouns to what your family calls you I'm offering to send you a Christmas card. It'll have your real name on the inside where only you can see it and your birth name or whatever name you choose on the envelope. Just let me know the name you want on the inside and on the envelope. If you're dealing with anything specific I can write about in the card let me know. I want this to be hopeful and make people happy at Christmas.

This is also open if you are out to everyone and you'd just like a Christmas card. Or if you don't have any family or you're alone, it's open to everyone!

The cards won't be religious, they'll have things like snowmen and santa on them.

Sadly I can only send to the UK because the price of international stamps is double uk stamps

If you want one of these cards send me a private message with your address, name for inside of the card, name for envelope and any other information you want to give me to personalise your card.

I just want to make people happy over the holidays.

2020-09-27 17:11:56,j0ur31,5,1,"Dear Mum, Dad and [Step-mum],

I doubt you realise this, but it’s almost been a year since I’ve realised my feelings about my gender, and they haven’t changed. I still feel like I’m in the wrong body and I still have a strong hatred for the way my body is and looks. Also, I have just turned 15 and feel like I have a little more responsibility for these kinds of things. Because of this, I wanted to bring up the subject with you again. 

I want to get my name and gender changed at school. I’ve already spoken with [counselling teacher 1] and [counselling teacher 2] about it at school. They’ve said I’ve been very mature and responsible with it and that they would do it as long as they had permission from you. I told them I’d have the conversation with you, since the last conversation with them before didn’t go at all how I wanted, since I was unprepared and didn’t know what to say. That’s one of the reasons I’ve written this in a letter: to make sure I say the right things instead of spouting random reasons to try and get you to let me be a boy. 

If you don’t agree, I completely understand. I just thought this was a good opportunity to get my thoughts across to you. I understand and agree that you want me to take things slowly and not go through major things (medication, etc.) until I’m 18, but I don’t think this really falls into that category. It’s a name/gender change, and if I change my mind, I can always change it back. However, if you think it’s too much, then I’ll wait and maybe ask again next year, when I’m 16. 

If you decide that I can, then I’ll tell them the next school day and you’ll most likely get a phone call from either of them to confirm that you agree. I’m planning on talking to [counselling teacher 1] and [counselling teacher 2] once you’ve told me if I can go through with it. If you do agree, I just want to tell you how much it means to me. My gender dysphoria has been quite bad the past few months and I didn’t really know what to do with myself. 

(I want to add that I’m so happy with how supportive you’ve been with letting me wear boys clothes and cut my hair short. There are lots of people out there whose parents would never let them and I’m so grateful for the fact that you have let me be myself in that way.)

Some extra things I’d like to add is how I’m seen at home and with family. I wanted to clarify the fact that just because I want to be seen as a boy at school doesn’t mean I also want to be seen that way at home. I’m still fine with family referring to me as she/her for the time being, but I would prefer if you stopped calling me things like “my little girl”. It makes me feel bad and, in a way, kind of insulted. I know it’s hard to understand — I can’t even really explain it myself — but it’s just the way I feel and I don’t think I’d be able to change that. 

When it comes to names, I’m not really all that fussy. The name “[deadname nickname]” is still fine for me, too. I don’t see it as a feminine name, since I suppose it could be short for “Alfie”. Nicknames like “[personal nickname]” and “[personal nickname]” are also fine for the name reason. I’d prefer you not call me names that are obviously feminine, like “princess”. I’d like it if you wouldn’t use my full first name “[full deadname]” (this isn’t a recent thing,I haven’t liked the double barrel name for a few years now) but [shortened deadname] is fine, of course. 

Like I said before, this is all up to you three. I don’t mind if you read over this and decide you’re not going to change anything. If you still want to call me feminine nicknames, or you don’t want me to change my name at school, it’s fine. My only thought was this was a good time to get my feeling across to you and help you understand that I’m still feeling this way. 

(I’m also sorry if I’ve worded some things wrong and come across in the wrong way. I mean to write all this in the most polite and open way possible.)

You’re all wonderful parents and I couldn’t wish for better ones. I hope you at least take some of my points into consideration. Thank you so much for reading this.

I am a trans guy and realised for the first time I'm serious about 4 years ago, but wasn't accepted really. My mum kept commenting ""You know that's the men's section?"" and ""That's a male shirt. You know that right? You're a girl..."" and so on. So I just dropped it. When I moved to my own place though I could freely think and dress how I wanted. So I fully realised ""I'm trans and I this body isn't mine. I need help!"" So I chatted with my friend who's trans and got courage and help to contact people and am currently waiting to be called for a meeting to see if I can start HRT etc.

I have come out to my parents, grandparents and my aunt (both dad's side.)
My aunt seems to understand the most, she said I'll always be in her heart whoever I am or decide to be.
My grandparents seemed to understand and caught on quickly asking for my new name, but since they are old they called me by birthname and she/her, but that's understandable.
My parents I told first of all, since I believed to be genderfluid for quite some time and came out as that whilst drunk, so I wanted to correct that, and since it's pretty accepted in Sweden it seems (imo) and that I'm tired of hiding who I am and all I just want it out ASAP so I can get help and people understand and call me correctly.

However, I just got home from my parents and my brother was there too, and I wanted to come out to him, but he is rather conservative, so I'm a bit more scared to come out to him, so I asked my parents, and they didn't understand that it's kind of important ""Since I will hopefully get help and change"" I said.
They didn't understand. So I explained it a bit more.
And they were SHOCKED. They thought I only want to be called by he/him and Lucas. They didn't understand or realise I'm serious and want to physically change and all to be comfortable in my own skin.
My mum literally said ""But *real name*, that's not necessary. You can't be serious!? Stop!"" basically and several times. I told them I'm serious and I will go through with it if I can and am able to and that it's my choice.
Mum was still against it, but dad was more chill like always, shrugging and said ""well... okay then..."" Then I just left because it was late and I felt super awkward.

I am now scared what they might say to others or possibly talk about behind my back as they do with others...

How can I deal with this? Have you been through the same?

So uhh... Where should I start? I'm 14 AMAB, living in homophobic country, also known as Poland. 

All this dysphoria thing started about 3 or 4 months ago (although I think I felt something was wrong even as far as about 2 years ago). At first I didn't think much about it and just thought it was a phase. Few weeks after I noticed it, I started questioning my gender. I've always felt like being a boy, but from this moment I thought about feeling and presenting more feminine. I talked about it with my best friend, who was also a part of LGBTQ+ community. We agreed to test if female pronouns were okay for me. I quickly get used to be reffered to as female. It just felt so right. It worked surprisingly well and some time later I chose my new name. It also felt so good and right. 

The first real problems started about month after that. I started to feel mental pain by just looking in the mirror. I hated almost every aspect of my body: my height, voice, hair on my body etc. I also felt really wrong, when members of my family reffered to me by my deadname and called me things like ""handsome"". Things just got worse, as the time passed by. Sometimes I cried by just looking at my appearance and thinking about future (I am afraid of being very masculine). The real dysphoria started about a month ago from now. This is when shit really went down. I used to cry everyday in my bed and there was this moment, where I was really deppressed and even started thinking about suicidal stuff. 

I really wish I was born as female. It's like my biggest dream. I dreamed about being in a relationship as female, I dreamed about living in society as female. I just wished I was cis (I didn't want to offend any one of You, but I've never wanted to be trans). All those thoughts and dreams had even worse impact on my mental health and it was a pain to think, that they'll never become true. 

As I mentioned before, I live in very conservative and homophobic country, where you can literally get beaten up on the street by just holding hands with person of the same sex. My parents are quite accepting, but I'm sure they'll be dissapointed if I told them all those thing I've written here. I'm afraid of ruining my whole life by just coming out.

It was something that I accepted, but I was a fan of just living with the hand I was dealt by life. But as of late that's changed. Where as before I put up with the sexual frustration of not liking my own body, envy of those that I considered attractive, and the resent for the pushes from society to be what I'm not with it's expectations of a man. In recent times I've been talking to a friend who has undergone a similar transformation and has witnessed countless of her friends undergo the same change, and it made me realize that maybe I should try and pursue this. Maybe I should shoot for higher than just okay with what I was dealt.

I have plans to start shaving my body hair, wearing leggings, skirts, and whatever in privacy. But aside from that, I am wanting to take things a bit slow because this is mostly uncharted territory for me. One of my friends that knows about these feelings I have has suggested I go to therapy. Something I currently don't have.

So I wanted to ask for advice/input and can answer questions.  
\-What are some good ways to try and ease into being more feminine without tipping everyone off?  
\-For those of you who have transitioned, how did you go about finding a specialist?   
\-How did you build up the courage to come out to your family and friends? Did you do it while already transitioning, before, after?   
\-Are there any risks I should know about, or any sort of decisions on the medical side I should know about?   
\-How long did your transition take and did you start HRT right away?

Here's some additional information about me;   
\-I live with my parents and my 13 year old sister out in the country in Alberta, Canada.   
\-No one knows about these feelings at the moment except for three of my friends only one of which lives by me.   
\-While I have had these feelings for as long as I can remember, only in the past 2 weeks have I really considered this possibility. Thinking about and discussing this possible future has made me the most excited and happy I have been in a long time. I don't know how or when, but I as of now do intend to start HRT at some point.   
\-I most likely will not be able to go to any doctors or specialists during covid due to my family living with me and being at risk.   
\-I want to try and make a decision and make a plan quickly because I would like to start as soon as possible, but I don't want to rush and I want to know what I'm getting into first.

2020-09-28 15:18:27,j1dx8m,2,1,"To start off, I really don't know too much about this topic, so if anything I say is incorrect or offensive please forgive me.

I was born male, but I've always wished that I could have been born female. There's a lot that's expected or assumed about men I believe, and it would just be so much easier to be myself if my sex just matched my gender.

One of the things that made me realize was that I hated seeing myself in mirrors and photos - not because I was overly self conscious, it just never feels like I'm looking at myself.

Unfortunately, no matter how much I may feel like a woman, I just don't feel like anything I could do to my current self (through surgery, hormone replacement, etc.) would make me into the person I know myself to be. For me, the best I can do is feel this way - in terms of sex I will never have the opportunity to be authentically female.

I even dedicated myself to exercising and getting in shape a few years ago, and while I'm definitely the healthiest I've ever been physically, it still doesn't help on the emotional side. It's like I've been doing somebody else's work the whole time.

For that reason (as well as having religious family), I've never really wanted to come out or anything of the sort. It's something that I feel like I have to keep to myself. Even if I came out, even if the people around me accepted the person I really am, nothing more would ever come of it for me.

So, I have some questions if anyone's able and willing to answer:

1) Would I still be considered trans even if I don't go through with any surgery/body modification?

2) Is it normal for people in my situation to never come out? Or just not feel the need to do so? I've heard stories about other people who had to come out for the benefit of their mental health, but I just don't think I stand to gain anything from it.

3) Would saying that I'm a trans woman make people assume I'm into people who are males (sexually speaking)? It's really hard to figure exactly who I am, but if I am trans - if my true self is female - then I suppose I'm a lesbian? Like, is sexual orientation determined by what sex you're attracted to, what gender you're attracted to, or both?

Life is a theatre. All people, including myself, tailor themselves to the roles they want to play or feel forced to play. We hide behind a mask because we are scared or uncomfortable with what is behind it, the fear of the unknown. Its only in a period with no role or crowd that the mask comes off and you start to ask the real questions about who you are under the mask. My mask is off now and its not going back on, the questions were many and the answers brought terror mixed with joy, smiles mixed with tears and yet more questions. Im not hiding from those questions behind a mask anymore or from the answers, im hitting them head on. The crowd may be shocked that this actress has no mask on anymore but they get over it in a short time and go back to their own roles and hide behind their own masks.

I'm resuming the Super Mario Galaxy stream tonight on Twitch and telling a bit more of the story about my grandfather, the importance of this game to me and how it helped pull me out of the slump I sank into when he passed, and how I knew I was going to marry the woman who became my wife. I am also very close to being able to start making money from streaming, I am two followers away from 50 and from there all I need to do is increase my average viewer count on my streams to 3 an hour. If you want to hear me ramble to the tune of Mario, or come support me in my goals, come hang out. I'll be at it most if not all night again, and I am aiming for 100% in this game.

One of my perfectionist, snob-nosed, Paula Dean lovin’, country bumpkin family’s most favorite things to tell me over Christmas dinner is:

***“I’ve just read too many stories about people regretting their decision because they realize that they’re freaks later on in their life.”***

A long time ago, Max (hi, that's me) from a different era would have believed this.  Today’s Max realized that they’re manipulative and will say anything to make sure that they’re right and that they can “fix the issue.”  So, the (very petty) question that I would ask to get a statistic would be what is the statistic of people who transitioned and regretted it? It’s a hard question to ask and for some (including myself) to even think about, but another serious question and the one to be asked…

***""…after transitioning, do you think that you will/you have regretted it?""***

Everything was fine and dandy until my professor wanted me to get the data, and now we're here.  The way that this research study was asked to be conducted would be to survey six different type of people:

* FTM/FTX **before** testosterone HRT.
* MTF/MTX **before** estrogen HRT.
* FTM/FTX during **testosterone** HRT.
* MTF/MTX **during** estrogen HRT.
* MTF/MTX **after** estrogen HRT.
* FTM/FTX after **testosterone** HRT.

2020-09-29 17:41:19,j2463t,0,1,"1) I don’t know if this is the right place to do this.    I am also new to this format (reddit) and I’m not 100 on the community rules, especially regarding length/topics of a post.  However I don’t know where else to seek thoughts and advice from.  I’ve talked to people, talked to my therapist, and now I’ve come to wisdom of the Internet.  Also please excuse if my verbiage gets technical.   I am a scientist by trade and heart and it’s how I tend to dialogue.  

2) I am a 31 year old born male, and I’m increasingly suspecting (or feeling) that I am a transgender woman  or some degree of non-binary.  Now the whole idea of “suspecting” it, I feel that is contrary to the idealistic case of “I was born a woman in a mans body”.   However the more I look into individual stories and cases the ideal case turns out to be just that, an ideal and typical case.  It does not appear to be representative of everyones experiences, or indicative/diagnostic of transgender individuals.   Like with most things the subject is significantly more complex and subtle (from what I’ve come to understand) and the “case” study is really a best simplified way to explain it to those not “in the know” as it were.  

3) since a young age I always had the fantasy and posed the question of “what would it be like to be the opposite sex?”.   For a long time I dismissed it as just a curiosity and a question in some kind of “grass is greener” scenario.   In time I realized and felt that question became less of a curiosity and turned 1st into a desire and then 2nd a deep seated need.   I needed to be a woman.   I sought out every bit of fiction of every “magical” or otherwise transformation where a man could be a woman.   Still I thought it was just for the “thrill” of the idea.   Slowly though, the thrill wore off but the feelings of need remained.   I was left with disappointment, emptiness, and envy.   Just as much as I would want to be with my girlfriend, I also wanted to be her (not her exactly, but to be a woman with her) and live out my life that way.  Just like seeing a picture of a woman in clothes I like I get envious that she gets to look beautiful in them and I never will.   I could put the clothes on yes, but it would never be the same.   It would be a lie, it would never fulfill what I wanted and felt.   I seem to have digressed into a heap of incoherent thoughts.   I’m just lost.   I don’t know what to do.   I know I’m just “me” but I don’t know what that even means.   To add fuel to the fire I’ve deal with depression all my life and likely (not officially diagnosed but similar symptoms) Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).   Which tends to lead to people not wanting to be themselves.   So I don’t want to be me, at least not this version of me.  So it’s a confusing line of do I not want to be me because of BPD ? Or do I not want to be me because I’ve been something else this whole time? OR to add more to it, is it a combination of all the above? Because if things were complicated enough BPD and GID tend to go hand in hand.


So I guess when all is said and done (as best I can without writing a thesis), I’m just lost.  I’m in pain.  I don’t know what to do next.   I don’t know if what I’m feeling is actually valid, or I’m just some demented perv with a fetish.

I am also new to this format (reddit) and I’m not 100 on the community rules, especially regarding length/topics of a post.  However I don’t know where else to seek thoughts and advice from.  I’ve talked to people, talked to my therapist, and now I’ve come to wisdom of the Internet.  Also please excuse if my verbiage gets technical.   I am a scientist by trade and heart and it’s how I tend to dialogue.  \n\n2) I am a 31 year old born male, and I’m increasingly suspecting (or feeling) that I am a transgender woman  or some degree of non-binary.  Now the whole idea of “suspecting” it, I feel that is contrary to the idealistic case of “I was born a woman in a mans body”.   However the more I look into individual stories and cases the ideal case turns out to be just that, an ideal and typical case.  It does not appear to be representative of everyones experiences, or indicative/diagnostic of transgender individuals.   Like with most things the subject is significantly more complex and subtle (from what I’ve come to understand) and the “case” study is really a best simplified way to explain it to those not “in the know” as it were.  \n\n3) since a young age I always had the fantasy and posed the question of “what would it be like to be the opposite sex?”.   For a long time I dismissed it as just a curiosity and a question in some kind of “grass is greener” scenario.   In time I realized and felt that question became less of a curiosity and turned 1st into a desire and then 2nd a deep seated need.   I needed to be a woman.   I sought out every bit of fiction of every “magical” or otherwise transformation where a man could be a woman.   Still I thought it was just for the “thrill” of the idea.   Slowly though, the thrill wore off but the feelings of need remained.   I was left with disappointment, emptiness, and envy.

I ruined one relationship a long time ago by confessing my feelings to a partner, so I was very hesitant to try again with my current girlfriend  We've been together 5 years, and its been one of those things where I'm pretty sure I want it to be forever, but I always knew in the back of my head that the ""well, I'm actually interested in transitioning..."" conversation would have to happen one day.

He became very unprofessional and frankly, hostile about it, so out of the 2 people I ever told, both reacted horribly.  Its fair to say I had a LOT of anxiety about telling anyone ever again.  Touch the stove, get burned, never wanna touch it again.

But last night I did it.  I told her.  I let her know I am planning to see someone to discuss my options and I didn't know 100% where it would go.  Maybe I will transition.  Maybe I won't.  But I wanted her to know, flat out, I was not happy with my body and have felt this way my whole life.  

I braced myself for an argument.  I braced myself for a breakup.  Hell, I braced myself for getting hurt, physically (she's not violent, but I know firsthand people can lose their shit over this).  What did I hear from her? The words I've been waiting to hear my whole life;

2020-09-30 02:48:37,j2dvk3,13,1,"Sitting here in tears,
I want to become who I'm meant to be,
Without breaking the hearts of those who love me,
I'm not strong enough to overcome my fears.


But tonight I get to dress again,
And drive around the town,
The darkness protecting me, helping to ensure I pass,
Dressing up stops me from being down,
I feel normal, alive, real, not at all a farce.

But I can't come out, not to them, not to anyone.
I'm scared, I'll embarrass my kids, my wife will leave me, my colleagues will shun me, my mostly perfect life will be over. Just because I'm a girl inside.

It's not fair. I didn't ask for this. Since 5 yrs old I can remember wanting to be a girl. 40yrs of internal torture. Relieved by intermittent dressing up. But never accepted by others because I've never been brave enough to take that step.

With other barriers in my life I have friends and family that support my, understand the problem and give advice. I haven't even told my best friend. What if she rejects me?

I'm just sitting here in tears again 
Maybe what I do desperately want is no longer an option because I chose to have a family instead.
Maybe I had my chance when I was young and blew it.

This secret Life has left me so distrustful of people. I can't share myself online for fear of being clocked. Who knows which of my friends would see me. And I don't pass well enough to be anonymous..

in one of her videos, though, she mentions she’s trans. im like “oh, ok, cool! noted,” and being a trans girl myself, i look around and see some more videos about her experience as a trans woman crop up. well, alright, that’s perfectly fine!
here’s where the weird part kicks in: after some time not watching a lot of YouTube, i start watching some of her videos again, but i can’t *quite focus* on the content. like, im paying attention to what she’s saying, and get the point she’s transmitting and all that, but im also catching myself wondering — how does she do her makeup? her voice is super feminine, but can someone notice she is trans by it? does she pass? — that kind of stuff.
now, like i said, im a (closeted) trans woman myself, and stopping to think about that has left me wondering. i rationalized those questions as me trying to get an insight on her trans experience, but i think that might not be the case? maybe it could be some sort of internalized transphobia? or misogyny? im trying my best to deconstruct those types of beliefs and behaviors, and this has been a weird experience that i think would be interesting to share and reflect upon.

2020-09-30 15:53:42,j2oqze,0,1,"Hello beautiful people 😊 I know a lot of us struggle with how to broach certain topics when we’re afforded the platform, and I just wanted to share a message I’ve sent to my fellow production team members as we prepare to rehearse Shrek The Musical (don’t worry, we’re splitting rehearsals, planning on masks/face shields for performances, taking temperatures, etc etc; also, don’t worry, we’re changing that very problematic lyric in Story of My Life). For context, our director is a cis white woman, who between not wanting to direct characters who are outside of her own experience (Donkey and Big Bad Wolf) as well as in the interest of having extra hands to cover split rehearsals for the sake of everyone’s health, has brought on a black woman as well as myself as assistant directors. There‘s no way I’d let this opportunity to address basic trans allyship pass me by, so I wanted to share the language I’m using with the production staff, well before rehearsal 1, with anyone who’s struggled to address these topics. Personal info has obviously been redacted, but I’ve already been thanked for sharing the intel as well as personal experience. I’m already feeling the shift in personal freedom/symbolic power that I’ll be experiencing for the next few months, but trust me when I say I’ll be prioritizing the hell out of self-care in interest of the former, so I can make full use of the latter. Stay strong, fam!



Hey good people!

Per a conversation I had with [director] last night, I have two requests to make of everyone in this thread to help bring a strong foundation of welcome and allyship to this production, specifically re: trans and/or gender non-conforming (GNC) folks.

First: introducing yourself with your pronoun. The only piece of information any cis (cis = identifying  with one’s assigned gender at birth) person needs to know to treat trans and/or GNC with respect in public spaces is their pronoun(s). However, it is common for trans/GNC people to withhold their pronouns, particularly in new spaces, for fear of backlash, being ignored, feeling pressured to explain more than they’re comfortable with, or the potential of being in a straight-up unsafe space. When cis people introduce themselves with their pronoun, it does two things: first, it welcomes everyone in that space to the do the same. This needs to come top-down in a rehearsal space! As we, the production staff, make a point of including our pronouns in our introductions, we make it clear that this is a space where pronouns will be heard and respected. Second, and more importantly for its implications and reach, it normalizes the discussion of pronouns. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve introduced myself as “Felix, they/them pronouns,” only to receive confused looks and have to explain what “pronoun” means. By this point in the conversation, I’m already feeling very on-the-spot, spending more time discussing gender than I ever want to in an everyday environment. We can only achieve a culture of trans allyship when cis people of all walks make it commonplace to establish pronouns as part of meeting new people, day-in and day-out.

Establishing your pronouns in a setting like a rehearsal process can be achieved in two ways (and please include both, at least for the first month or so of your interaction with the cast!): first and most obviously, including them when you introduce yourself out loud. Your pronoun should sit right next to your name, because it is more vital to your identity than anything else you might have cause to announce out loud. You might be producing a show now (for example) but not six months from now, but six months from now, you still have specific pronouns you want people to refer to you by to respect your identity. For those of you who do your artistic thang month-in and month-out, I will absolutely pull the trans card now and say, I’m sorry, I respect and admire everything you do, but in the bigger picture, your pronouns are more important than your career. It’s as simple as “Hi, I’m [director], she/her pronouns, and for those of you who don’t know, I’m your director!” or “Hey everyone, [scenic designer], he/him pronouns here, I just wanted to run you down on a few of the set pieces you’ll be working with today.” The second way to establish your pronouns and normalize their discussion is so easy, because you can set it and forget it: email signatures. Right after your name, in the same line (or very next line at the latest), include your pronouns (either in parentheses or following a comma if in the same line). For example:

[my full name] (they/them pronouns)
Assistant Director, Shrek the Musical
[production company]

or

[director’s full name]
She/Her/Hers
Director, Shrek the Musical
(###) ###-####
*******@gmail.com


Introducing yourself with your pronouns is just that easy, it becomes habit with time (please start practicing! even for trans folks it can feel weird at first!), and I promise you: it will make any trans, GNC, or even questioning individual feel safer and more respected in your shared spaces.


The second big piece of trans allyship? Striking gendered language from your vernacular. I know, I know, we all grow up hearing “ladies and gentlemen,” “boys and girls,” “basses sounding good, tenors join them, gentlemen from measure 55 please,” etc etc. How many of you have heard me insist on “sopranos and altos” and “tenors and basses” in music rehearsals I’ve run in the past? It is very intentional. The simple fact is, you never know when you might be addressing someone whose relationship with gender is more complicated than it appears, and you never know when addressing that person as their assigned gender at birth might be causing mental and emotional anguish. Neutralizing your language in referring to groups of people, via “friends,” “folks,” “sopranos and altos,” “y’all,” “dancers,” or what-have-you will instantly make your space more accessible and welcoming. Wanna know something personal real quick? I miss my days in ~~ Men’s Chorus. I would love to join a community ensemble of tenors and basses again and enjoy being part of that awesome, unique timbre, but I haven’t and likely won’t, because I know walking into that space would be an invitation for me to be referred to and seen as a man, and I just don’t have the emotional space to deal with that on a regular basis. Every time a stranger (especially someone who is AMAB–assigned male at birth) calls me “man,” “bro,” or uses he/him pronouns by default, it just brings my current emotional well-being down a peg. Please help keep our rehearsal space safe, not only physically, but mentally and emotionally, by avoiding language that makes assumptions and lumps people together in a gendered way.


[director] and I have talked, and we’ll be finding a time early in the rehearsal process for me to address this with the cast as well, but as I mentioned, this comes top-down. If I share these points October ~~, but by mid-November, I’m the only member of the production team sticking to my guns about it, I WILL lose credibility in the eyes of the cast (subconsciously, to be sure) and we will be letting this opportunity to increase awareness and allyship regarding issues of gender pass us by. It is in line with the mission of [production company], as well as the spirit of Shrek the Musical, that we take this stance together. Allyship is an ACTIVE process, and I need every single one of you to help me bring about this change in our sphere of influence. We reach so many people at [production company], and this gives us huge potential for a ripple-on-the-pond effect over the next [length of rehearsal process + show run].

[director] and I have also discussed finding a specific time in an all-cast rehearsal to set aside for “ask a trans person anything,” but if any of you have any questions as we ready ourselves for this process, please don’t hesitate to ask! (but don’t be surprised if I’m not in the headspace to answer immediately; I’ll get to it, I promise)

Thank you all in advance! I’m so excited for everything about this rehearsal process!!

For context, our director is a cis white woman, who between not wanting to direct characters who are outside of her own experience (Donkey and Big Bad Wolf) as well as in the interest of having extra hands to cover split rehearsals for the sake of everyone’s health, has brought on a black woman as well as myself as assistant directors. There‘s no way I’d let this opportunity to address basic trans allyship pass me by, so I wanted to share the language I’m using with the production staff, well before rehearsal 1, with anyone who’s struggled to address these topics. Personal info has obviously been redacted, but I’ve already been thanked for sharing the intel as well as personal experience. I’m already feeling the shift in personal freedom/symbolic power that I’ll be experiencing for the next few months, but trust me when I say I’ll be prioritizing the hell out of self-care in interest of the former, so I can make full use of the latter.

2020-09-30 17:11:16,j2q9e2,8,1,"Hello redditors, I need some help. I created a new account (this is my alt) because my friends know my real account and I don’t want them seeing this.
 I am a 14 year old AMAB in an all boys school ( I don’t feel that out of place there) and I have suspicions that I’m not a boy. I have had suspicions for a while, I always had day dreams about marrying someone as a woman and stuff like that but I brushed it off as just my imagination being weird. Also as a young child I had a few dreams (like actual dreams while you sleep lol) about being a girl and I watched a few “girly” shows convincing myself I did not like them.
There was a brief moment in my life where I crossdressed, wearing dresses, skirts and other girl’s clothes but I stopped as I did not have the opportunity to do it but I definitely enjoyed it and would still enjoy it now.
Anyway, as I said earlier I always had suspicions I was trans but was probably about 30% sure and it was not really bugging me until at about the start of this year I randomly started thinking about it more. I have no idea what caused it but it was in the center of my mind a lot and I thought about it late at night most. However it suddenly stopped after 2 weeks and went back to normal where I was about 30% sure I was trans. It was very strange but like most strange things, I brushed it of as nothing.
So a few months later in July I saw a post in r/splatoon about a glitch someone encountered during an online match. I was in the match and said something like “hey I was in this match!” OP recognised my username (I’m not saying it, I don’t want my friends to find out who I am if they somehow saw this post) and they later referred to me as a her when talking about how they saw me in the match (I swear if that OP sees this post I am going to be upset). I read it and felt happy and that really confused me. I was thinking about it occasionally for a few days but then forgot about it. However it slowly came back into my mind along with other thoughts about being a girl
Eventually these thoughts came more and more prevalent and in early September when school started I was thinking about being a girl a lot, it got really bad, I found it hard to write my name because I wanted a more female name (which was unfortunate as we had to write our names a lot while labelling books) and being female was on my mind the most. I didn’t tell anyone but I hinted at it because I’m such a bad liar but I don’t think anyone is suspicious of me. Since then it has got a little better but I still catch myself dreaming about being a girl a lot or thinking about going into school in girl’s clothes during mufti and wanting people to not recognise me as a boy.
I don’t have a lot of friends who are girls (most of my friends are boys but I go to a boy school so that’s not surprising) and when I was younger I didn’t think about being a girl this much.
If you have read all of this, firstly thank you, I know I would not read a post this long, and secondly I’m not sure if I’m going through a phase or I’m actually trans (or something else) so I’d appreciate your help.

I read it and felt happy and that really confused me. I was thinking about it occasionally for a few days but then forgot about it. However it slowly came back into my mind along with other thoughts about being a girl\nEventually these thoughts came more and more prevalent and in early September when school started I was thinking about being a girl a lot, it got really bad, I found it hard to write my name because I wanted a more female name (which was unfortunate as we had to write our names a lot while labelling books) and being female was on my mind the most. I didn’t tell anyone but I hinted at it because I’m such a bad liar but I don’t think anyone is suspicious of me. Since then it has got a little better but I still catch myself dreaming about being a girl a lot or thinking about going into school in girl’s clothes during mufti and wanting people to not recognise me as a boy.\nI don’t have a lot of friends who are girls (most of my friends are boys but I go to a boy school so that’s not surprising) and when I was younger I didn’t think about being a girl this much.\nIf you have read all of this, firstly thank you, I know I would not read a post this long, and secondly I’m not sure if I’m going through a phase or I’m actually trans (or something else) so I’d appreciate your help. This is stressing me out and makes me anxious. Also can you tell me where else I should post this, thanks.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am I trans?', 'created': 1601511076.0}"

2020-09-30 22:42:59,j2whbl,0,1,"TL;DR at end

First, some context:

I (NB TF) live with my grandparents (who I am not out to yet; this is relevant later), but I have spent the past few months in a different state with my parents. I drove back to my grandparents's on Monday.

My truck has a topper with a roof box on it, so after unloading my stuff from the bed, I started on the roof box. It can open from both sides, which is really nice since it has a lot of capacity. I grabbed a few bags from one side, latched it, then went to the other side to get the rest. Problem was, I had not really latched it.

So I am getting things out when the other side pops loose and now this lid is wobbling all over the place, and I am having a hell of a time getting it back down. In the process I may have said a few choice words. I finally got it secured and took my things inside thinking nothing more of it.

Fast forward to today and my grandfather tells me that while he and my grandmother were eating breakfast on the patio this morning, one of their friends stopped by to chat and said, ""there was some woman trying to close that box on that truck and she sounded a lot like me."" (I presume she meant the curses, not the actual sound of my voice.)

For clarity here, I am pre-everything and present male in public. I was wearing jogging pants, a tank top, a mask, and had my hair in a ponytail. When my grandfather told me this story I had that terribly awkward moment of glowing on the inside, but trying to be stoic on the outside. It was just such a random affirmation and has actually made my day. I may not stop wearing a mask when the pandemic ends.
