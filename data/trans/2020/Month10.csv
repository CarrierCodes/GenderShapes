However when I think about those things I'm kinda worried about where I would work once I've finished school (and university after that). Sadly many places seem to be unwilling to take trans people or even those who slightly deviate from the norm.

2020-10-01 12:57:08,j381w1,3,1,"I feel like it’s a really big step to decide that you’re trans and ooo boy I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s been popping up in my head every day for the past month.

I’m AFAB. I have always preferred males over females, not just romantically, but because of everything. I wanted to be like them and didn’t feel anything special about being female.

I’ve always wanted to be a father rather than a mother, didn’t know why though. Dads just warm my heart more than mothers do and so does being called one I guess, even though I prefer my own mother over my dad since she’s more accepting of everything.

Boys’ clothes are amazing and girls’ clothes are trash imo and I’ve always been like this. The first time I wore a button-up shirt I felt so comfortable and euphoric though I didn’t know why. I just thought it was because I finally wore clothes I like, but now I think it might be some more since I like lots of other boys’ clothes as well. Count short hairstyles in as well.

I don’t really mind female pronouns, though when somebody calls me ‘he’ I feel kind of euphoric... I guess? The same happens when somebody calls me the name I’ve chosen in case I’m indeed male. I’m not very sure of what kind of feelings I experience, but I’m trying to understand them as hard as I can. Also, I don’t think my current name is that bad. I do feel uncomfortable when it’s the first time people try to pronounce it, because I always need to tell them how it’s done, which I, as an introvert at that moment, truly hate.

I’m pretty sure I’m not nonbinary either. I don’t like they/them pronouns and being bigendered, genderfluid, queer or something like that makes me even more confused. I feel like the right thing for me would be being only female or only male.

About dysphoria... I don’t know? I have felt kind of dysphoric about my bum for a pretty long time. My chest doesn’t really make me dysphoric, I just wish I could take off a shirt and go swimming without people being weirded out. Besides all practical cases, a flat chest still appeals to me. My bottom genitalia don’t make me dysphoric either. Though I would prefer being able to pee while standing and not just because it’s a practical extra.

2020-10-02 02:06:32,j3m47b,1,1,"Okay, so this is going to be a long post - I apologize in advance. Also, TW this post features some solid intentional misgendering and whatnot from my lovely mother and familial drama.   


Oof.   


Okay, so I came out to my parents as trans in the late half of the Year of Our Lord 2012. I had been in therapy and struggling with gender woes for a bit and as trans folk and the act of transitioning started to tiptoe its' way into the public spotlight, I thought - ""okay cool - I can do this now.""  


Well, the conversation went less-than great and my parents opposed my desire to transition; asking that I ""make sure"" it was what I wanted and to go to therapy (not with a queer-focused therapist though, because they have ""an agenda"", a therapist for ""normal people""). So, I agreed. The reaction initially put me off the idea of transitioning and through therapy I came to this point where I decided it would be easier to just claim that I was gay. 

I had THAT coming out discussion with them in 2014.  Putting their transgender kid fears to rest. For the time being. 

Now, I'd like to add that at this point in my life I was in my mid twenties. I very easily could have pursued transition on my own.  But, knowing the harsh reaction from my folks, and not necessarily wanting to sever my relationship with my family - I just kinda - decided not to. It was easier at the time and, well, I could always pursue transition after they died, right? Right. 

So I existed as gay, when the gender dysphoria got bad, I found a home as a drag performer that provided me with opportunities multiple times a week to indulge in a bit of gender euphoria. This worked GREAT for about three years until eventually, what used to cause me an intense feeling of euphoria started doing the opposite. The act of getting INTO drag was uplifting and gave me sense of immense comfort. The shows were great, I've always loved performing and doing that presenting feminine (even an exaggerated form of feminine) was a dream come true for me. However when it came time to take it all off, that feeling of elation took a nose dive into a borderline traumatizing place. I was stripping away what I saw as my true self on almost a nightly basis and as one could assume, my mental health took a pretty steady plunge from there.    

ANYWAY - so I decided (finally) to go through with a medical transition. Came out to my parents (again) and basically told them that this is what I was going to be doing and they had no input. They could accept it or not. I'm 31 - they do not NEED to approve.   


To my surprise, they were really supportive this time. They expressed to me that they knew this was something I'd given a lot of thought to and if it was something I needed to do they'd support me. All of that stayed true until I started living as female full time. At about four months into hormones, I started to feel more secure in my gender and started living as such. I came out at work, started working toward a name change, and am pretty much solidly and comfortably existing fully in my gender. 

The other day, I got a call from my dad letting my know that some mail of mine had been delivered to their house. So, I was out and about running errands (looking like who I am, a goddamn woman) and I just stopped by there to get whatever it was that had come for me. This was the first time (thanks covid) that they've seen me presenting as female  in person (there's plenty of pics on my Facebook that they largely responded positively to) and all of a sudden all the support went out the window. My mother all but had a breakdown, started screaming at me about me having ""the audacity"" to show up to her home that way. Went into some rant about ""watching her son die"" and made fun of my makeup. 

It was completely out of the blue, a gut punch, and tbh I have zero idea if I want to see or speak with her or my father ever again. They said they were just ""struggling"" and needed time. But, they've refused to adopt my pronouns, and chose to be as cruel as possible in order to make some kind of point.   


Basically, I have two questions:   
First - Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? I'm a grown adult. I support myself fully. And, to be blunt, there's a lot of pre-existing issues between my mother and I anyway that likely won't be resolved. 

Second - Does anyone have any resources I can forward to them about parents coming to terms with a trans child (adult child is still a child right? )   


I'm very torn on where I want to go with this. But I really could use some advice from the community here.

I had been in therapy and struggling with gender woes for a bit and as trans folk and the act of transitioning started to tiptoe its\' way into the public spotlight, I thought - ""okay cool - I can do this now.""  \n\n\nWell, the conversation went less-than great and my parents opposed my desire to transition; asking that I ""make sure"" it was what I wanted and to go to therapy (not with a queer-focused therapist though, because they have ""an agenda"", a therapist for ""normal people""). So, I agreed. The reaction initially put me off the idea of transitioning and through therapy I came to this point where I decided it would be easier to just claim that I was gay. \n\nI had THAT coming out discussion with them in 2014.  Putting their transgender kid fears to rest. For the time being. \n\nNow, I\'d like to add that at this point in my life I was in my mid twenties. I very easily could have pursued transition on my own.  But, knowing the harsh reaction from my folks, and not necessarily wanting to sever my relationship with my family - I just kinda - decided not to. It was easier at the time and, well, I could always pursue transition after they died, right? Right. \n\nSo I existed as gay, when the gender dysphoria got bad, I found a home as a drag performer that provided me with opportunities multiple times a week to indulge in a bit of gender euphoria. This worked GREAT for about three years until eventually, what used to cause me an intense feeling of euphoria started doing the opposite. The act of getting INTO drag was uplifting and gave me sense of immense comfort. The shows were great, I\'ve always loved performing and doing that presenting feminine (even an exaggerated form of feminine) was a dream come true for me. However when it came time to take it all off, that feeling of elation took a nose dive into a borderline traumatizing place. I was stripping away what I saw as my true self on almost a nightly basis and as one could assume, my mental health took a pretty steady plunge from there.    \n\nANYWAY - so I decided (finally) to go through with a medical transition. Came out to my parents (again) and basically told them that this is what I was going to be doing and they had no input. They could accept it or not. I\'m 31 - they do not NEED to approve.   \n\n\nTo my surprise, they were really supportive this time. They expressed to me that they knew this was something I\'d given a lot of thought to and if it was something I needed to do they\'d support me. All of that stayed true until I started living as female full time. At about four months into hormones, I started to feel more secure in my gender and started living as such. I came out at work, started working toward a name change, and am pretty much solidly and comfortably existing fully in my gender. \n\nThe other day, I got a call from my dad letting my know that some mail of mine had been delivered to their house. So, I was out and about running errands (looking like who I am, a goddamn woman) and I just stopped by there to get whatever it was that had come for me. This was the first time (thanks covid) that they\'ve seen me presenting as female  in person (there\'s plenty of pics on my Facebook that they largely responded positively to) and all of a sudden all the support went out the window. My mother all but had a breakdown, started screaming at me about me having ""the audacity"" to show up to her home that way. Went into some rant about ""watching her son die"" and made fun of my makeup. \n\nIt was completely out of the blue, a gut punch, and tbh I have zero idea if I want to see or speak with her or my father ever again. They said they were just ""struggling"" and needed time. But, they\'ve refused to adopt my pronouns, and chose to be as cruel as possible in order to make some kind of point.   \n\n\nBasically, I have two questions:   \nFirst - Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? I\'m a grown adult. I support myself fully. And, to be blunt, there\'s a lot of pre-existing issues between my mother and I anyway that likely won\'t be resolved. \n\nSecond - Does anyone have any resources I can forward to them about parents coming to terms with a trans child (adult child is still a child right? )   \n\n\nI\'m very torn on where I want to go with this. But I really could use some advice from the community here.   \n\n\nThanks all. Much love.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Advice for My ""Struggling"" Parents', 'created': 1601629592.0}"

2020-10-03 03:05:29,j48fjm,1,1,"My state recently failed to pass a ban on conversion therapy. While those in support of the ban are regrouping and preparing to try again, several state house *Republicans* are performing a ""study"" to see if the benefits outweigh the risks. These same House Republicans are attempting to create legislation that would actually make conversion therapy MORE accessible to parents and guardians. It is the most blatantly biased thing I've ever seen.

The study consists of interviewing an unspecified number of people. An unspecified percentage of the interviewees will be therapists and psychiatrists who practice conversion therapy. Allowing practitioners to partake in this is extremely biased and unethical. 

Here is what I need from anyone who is willing: I just want your story and experience with Conversion Therapy. Be as brutally honest as possible about the harmful effects the practice has. People need to know how not ok it is. 

Anybody who is willing to help me with this, you can message your story to me here on reddit or email it to ban.ct.petition@gmail.com or if there is another method you are more comfortable with, I'll see if I can make it happen. Everyone will remain anonymous.


I need as many eyes to see this as possible. I need as many responses as possible. I want these fuckers to feel the hurt and pain that they are causing. Who knows, if I can get enough support from within my state and from elsewhere, maybe I can convince my ""baby trump"" governor to ban it with an executive order. 

I am going to post this to several subreddits and other social media sites, but I can't do this alone. Even if this doesn't affect you I am begging for your help. If anyone you know has suffered because of this disgusting practice, get them on board with this.

Note to the moderators: 

Normally I would have asked permission before posting this, but in my experience it can take days to hear back from mods, and this is urgent. I am very sorry if this violates any of your rules, but my intentions are good. I need your help. I need this community's help.

These same House Republicans are attempting to create legislation that would actually make conversion therapy MORE accessible to parents and guardians. It is the most blatantly biased thing I\'ve ever seen.\n\nThe study consists of interviewing an unspecified number of people. An unspecified percentage of the interviewees will be therapists and psychiatrists who practice conversion therapy. Allowing practitioners to partake in this is extremely biased and unethical. \n\nHere is what I need from anyone who is willing: I just want your story and experience with Conversion Therapy. Be as brutally honest as possible about the harmful effects the practice has. People need to know how not ok it is. \n\nAnybody who is willing to help me with this, you can message your story to me here on reddit or email it to ban.ct.petition@gmail.com or if there is another method you are more comfortable with, I\'ll see if I can make it happen. Everyone will remain anonymous.\n\n\nI need as many eyes to see this as possible. I need as many responses as possible. I want these fuckers to feel the hurt and pain that they are causing. Who knows, if I can get enough support from within my state and from elsewhere, maybe I can convince my ""baby trump"" governor to ban it with an executive order. \n\nI am going to post this to several subreddits and other social media sites, but I can\'t do this alone. Even if this doesn\'t affect you I am begging for your help. If anyone you know has suffered because of this disgusting practice, get them on board with this.\n\nNote to the moderators: \n\nNormally I would have asked permission before posting this, but in my experience it can take days to hear back from mods, and this is urgent. I am very sorry if this violates any of your rules, but my intentions are good. I need your help. I need this community\'s help.

I hope this post finds you all well. I’m a cis-gender gay male and I’ve always been in support of the community. 

I recently moved to a new city and a trans man would like to take me on a date. I’ve never been in this situation but I am open to giving anyone a chance. 

However, I’m afraid I may do something that could be triggering. Does anyone have any advice for a cos-gendered person going on dates with trans folks? 

I hope this isn’t offensive to anyone. I just want to educate myself and make sure I’m aware and don’t say something sideways or do something that is a big no-no.

Some bullet points:
Mother is extremely manipulative ""Think of how this makes me feel"" is her go to argument and religion. Also she likes to say ""Praying for you to change"" as a petty way to say Im hoping a divine force coerces you to change, which is insulting to everyone including the god they try to rope in

Grandparents call everything LGBT a sexual perversion

I wanted a bit of light heartedness in it so I ""came out politically as a joke."" (If you cant guess by the rest of this family is Christian Conservative)

I really don't remember my child hood except for specific moments that carried a lot of weight with me

When Pride parades were really big my grandparents and mom worked at a Christian voting information style workplace. They went to a parade and covered their faces to hide their identity so that they didn't get shamed or recognized.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This has been a long time of consideration and trying to figure myself out. I will preface this by saying I will likely not answer my phone or texts for a few days after posting this. I set a day to come out and ironically #nationalcomingoutday is soon or today depending on when I post this as this is a draft. I do not want to hear ""Im praying for you to change"" as that is insulting at the very least Christian or not asking a god to change someone is insulting to the person and the god whomever you are praying to.

I have been dealing with Dysphoria for pretty much as long as I can remember. I never felt right in my body. Too much body hair, too tall or too short depending on the day, hair too short even though it is long now. Etc. Ive been questioning what is causing the dysphoria and came to the realization that I do not feel as though the gender I was born as matches me. No one talked me into this, and up until I decided this I despised the trans community (and now I know why I do because I hated myself)

In my dreams I was always a women. My earliest know instance of dysphoria was playing morrowind on the original xbox. My older brother got mad or something that I was playing a female character and I was heartbroken that it was supposedly wrong to do so. At the time when I didnt know the game I saw nothing wrong with this, even though now I know there are stat differences between male and female characters. From that point forward I never played a male character unless a video game made me, and I genuinely put myself into the character. That was when I was really young (Do not remember the age my entire childhood is a blur to me and it scares me because I do not actually know anything that happened to me). From that point forward I always had small dysphoric instances here and there. Suddenly just deciding to shave my legs because I wanted more feminine legs, growing my beard out to try to fight the dysphoria etc. I didnt know what was going on and I didnt know dysphoria existed until 2020. 

For the past 3 years with (Insert S/O's name) I have hinted my feelings towards her feeling safe to come out of my shell and what I was dealing with but I never explicitly said what I felt because I was still fighting myself. 

If you think this is a phase it has been with me my entire life

If you think its a sexual perversion, it has nothing to do sex

If you think Im a godless heathen, well I guess according to what you wish to believe I guess I am. But that same bible that I know will be used against me has many contradictions to the modern day church it is truly heartbreaking to see.

On the topic of coming out Im gonna come out politically I'm an anarchist. Meaning government should be minimal at least non-existent at best and should treat each other as we should be treated.

That should be it. I have already decided on a name as well and will likely be dropping the last name as I know they don't want to associate with anything LGBT as I have one distinct memory around 2012 where family members went to a pride parade to see it and had to cover their faces to not be recognized. So don't worry this black sheep wont be a stain on the family name. Though I will be open to maintaining healthy relationships with blood kin who treat me equally I do not fully see myself being accepted back as a (Insert family name).


Tl:dr Im coming out as a trans woman I expect to be disowned or patronized by my family. I can no longer feign my happiness by making other happy while also forsaking myself.

Some (maybe) important informations
One of my bosses (they are all mostly in the office) is really happy to finally have a girl working there.
It's a small company, everyone knows each other.
I always use the mens restroom cause there isn't one for girls (there is only one at the office).
I really have no idea what most of the people think about lgbt in general.

So i’ve been out as trans since June, been on hormones for about a month and a half now. When i was younger i was sexually assaulted by a neighbor that was a little older and just have always had a weird relationship with men. I like the idea of sleeping with a dude and getting dicked down, for lack of better terms. however it makes me feel a little insecure because i don’t want to be seen as feminine even though it seems like this guy is pretty respectful regarding my boundaries and everything. 
For context purposes ive slept with multiple cis men but haven’t since i’ve come out &amp; would like some other people that can relate to give their input?
is there anything i can do, mentality wise, to be less anxious about this encounter?

 I'm writing a paper/article for a class I'm taking, and the topic was marginalized groups. I wanted to write about systemic discrimination against transgender people because in my eyes they've been one of the most oppressed / marginalized groups in the United States.

Essentially what I'm asking of you is to share any anecdotes / stories / experiences that you've had in which you've been discriminated against just for being who you are in areas including but not necessarily limited to Insurance, Healthcare, Banking, Education, Housing, Military, or others. You absolutely do not have to provide any identifying information, feel free to use an alias and/or change specific identifying details, I just want to include your experience if you're willing to share. What I'm going for is to use personal stories and anecdotes and weave in statistics like those found in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey to kind of paint a broad picture of transgender discrimination in the United States. 

In the class we're working closely with several activist groups in Cincinnati like the Homeless Coalition, but for this particular project we're collaborating with the Streetvibes magazine. The article, if the editors think its good, could be published in the magazine. 

Thank you for taking the time to read, bigger thank you if you decide to share. If you decide to share your story, whether or not I was able to include it, I will send you the finished copy of the article once it's been graded. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

If you decide to share your story, whether or not I was able to include it, I will send you the finished copy of the article once it's been graded. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

I began therapy for depression/suicidal thoughts around July. My mother and father are divorced and have married others. I currently live solely with my mom and stepdad.

The first thing we talked about was having a high displeasure about my genitals and just general disgust and such from having them as well as how I regularly got suicidal tendencies from my bio father. This led my therapist to wondering about if my bodily hatred was stemming from having such a negative, toxic, even abusive/abuse enabler that led into depression and even two halfhearted attempts at suicide as well as regular thought patterns around it. I started full acknowledgement of being female as well as that I was better off without my bio dad around the same time. I went on antidepressants a few weeks later after my therapist made a semi-official diagnosis of dysphoria.

I'm AFAB and 16. I've never really had a ""problem"" with my assigned gender and its corresponding sex (although, to be fair, my body doesn't look very feminine at all. perhaps that would be different if I had curves, and, you know, ***^tiddies***). but I also know that if I somehow magically woke up in a hyper-masculine body (6'2"", super cut jaw, 8 pack, the whole shabang) i wouldn't really mind that either.

and......... pronouns? the fuck are those? I've been called she my entire life, which is ok I guess, but if I ever get gendered as a he (i have short hair so thats understandable) I'm also kinda like... eh. like I just dont really care? 

is it possible that I'm non binary? agender? there's a part of me thats like, yeah, maybe I'm enby and I can change my name to be more androgynous and maybe take light dosages of T. but there's another part of me that just (^sorry ^if ^this ^sounds ^weird).... doesn't really care? like I'm not sure if I care enough to go through all that?

I'm fairly knew to the topic of being trans or enby, so I'm sorry if any of this is insensitive or if I sound like a cis person asking for attention. I don't really know enough to figure out what any of this means, so are there any more knowledgeable people who can give me advice?

I\'ve been called she my entire life, which is ok I guess, but if I ever get gendered as a he (i have short hair so thats understandable) I\'m also kinda like... eh. like I just dont really care? \n\nis it possible that I\'m non binary? agender? there\'s a part of me thats like, yeah, maybe I\'m enby and I can change my name to be more androgynous and maybe take light dosages of T. but there\'s another part of me that just (^sorry ^if ^this ^sounds ^weird).... doesn\'t really care? like I\'m not sure if I care enough to go through all that?\n\nI\'m fairly knew to the topic of being trans or enby, so I\'m sorry if any of this is insensitive or if I sound like a cis person asking for attention. I don\'t really know enough to figure out what any of this means, so are there any more knowledgeable people who can give me advice?\n\nif you made it down here. thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you have a wonderful day :D\n\nTL;DR im confused as to whether i may be trans or enby but I could also just be a tomboy help please om confused', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'ah, yes. ✨gender✨', 'created': 1601983677.0}"

Though I'd still give anything to be a girl, It's most certainly the transition &amp; outcome I'm worried about.

Then I found this reddit, reading through all your stories has brought out the little hope left in me &amp; now I'm beginning to look at both sides again.

I've been messing around with FaceApp for about 4\~ years now too, I remember a single YouTuber reviewing it before everyone else &amp; how quickly I rushed to the appstore to download it, I played with it for hours on end just trying to get a good female filter shot, over the years its become easier to use FaceApp to the point you can get a decently good photo out of nearly any shot.  
I still sit down for an hour or so each day just to look into the eyes of how I actually feel.

This would probably be my favourite shot so far :)

Though I\'d still give anything to be a girl, It\'s most certainly the transition &amp; outcome I\'m worried about.\n\nThen I found this reddit, reading through all your stories has brought out the little hope left in me &amp; now I\'m beginning to look at both sides again.\n\nI\'ve been messing around with FaceApp for about 4\\~ years now too, I remember a single YouTuber reviewing it before everyone else &amp; how quickly I rushed to the appstore to download it, I played with it for hours on end just trying to get a good female filter shot, over the years its become easier to use FaceApp to the point you can get a decently good photo out of nearly any shot.  \nI still sit down for an hour or so each day just to look into the eyes of how I actually feel.\n\nThis would probably be my favourite shot so far :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8z99a4qbjr51.jpg?width=1270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d4f2b08c78d0741d0a01e766a12a9ada48e0c22', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Getting Hope', 'created': 1602041666.0}"

2020-10-07 04:53:19,j6ktta,1,1,"I’m still very upset so I apologize for the long emotional post. 

I just lost my first long term relationship of three years in a devastating messy way and got put back into homelessness as he was my sole family. I stopped posting myself or being active anywhere on the internet to assuage his insecurities and totally wrapped my self confidence up in our relationship. 

I am nowhere ready to start dating again, and I’m trying to recognize this unhealthy subconscious idea I *need* to be in a relationship to be allowed to exist, but also feeling like I’m so undeserving of good things and I won’t ever find that kind of unconditional support again. 

I’ve recently uncovered some early childhood abuse and he was the first partner I shared that with, it lead me to feel increasing less comfortable with sex. Looking back it seems like we started having problems when our frequency declined till it got to the point he was angry snapping at me for very little inconsequential things till it felt clear he wanted me so uncomfortable I’d leave so he could avoid the responsibility of putting me out. 

I’m scared I won’t be capable of finding a partner that will accept me and love me unconditionally without some kind of sexual expectations of me as a trans woman. Any guy who’s ever had interest in me it’s started because of his sexual curiosity and at one point I was very confident sexually. 

Now it’s like I’m broken, discarded, and can expect a life full of hardship because of it. I am not financially solvent and struggle to be since stopping my work for my relationship and I can’t go back to that work as I cannot stop these horrid flashbacks ever since this came out. 

I’d like to know if any of you have tried dating openly asexual or if anyone has/had an asexual relationship and how you went about finding that connection?

Or if anyone has CSA experience and is still successfully dating, how’d you manage to get to that point, are you open with your partners?

Alright so I'm set up in the new room and going to resume streaming after a couple of days off. I'm picking back up with the horror content this time with Evil Within. No more hiding in barrels listening to cultists describe in visceral gooey detail what they plan to do to me, now I can fight back. 

Now I played Evil Within years ago when it first came out on PS4, but haven't touched it since then. This will be my first run with it on PC, and my first run with the DLC which I do intend to check out both the story DLC and the more for fun and combat heavy executioner DLC. 

Evil Within, while still a dark, twisted horror game is not as overwhelmingly crushing as Observer and Outlast were, and is more family friendly especially, or at least as much so as a horror game can be. It's from the mind of Shinji Mikami, the big name behind Resident Evil. Come join me as I jump back into a series of deeper rabbit holes armed with a trusty ...crossbow? I'm a detective right, why am I using a crossbow? Why do I have a crossbow when that guy gets a chainsaw? How is this even fair, at least like give me a barrel to hide in...

It probably couldn't have gone better. Telling her I was also bisexual was a walk in the park. It was crazy. She told me she was bi as well. 

She had a lot of trans friends and really wants to get into contact again. It's kind of overwhelming. She's thinking of using the inherited money from my probably transphobic conservative great grandmother to help me. 

It's going reeeeaaaly fast. I have no idea how to tell my dad and grandparents though. This took quite a lot of intense talking to understand, that I could just say it out loud.

I've been medically transitioning for over a year now. I do not always pass since my gender expression is very fluid (my gender to a certain extent too). That's why I don't expect people to call me by the correct pronouns all the time. However, there's a person very close to me that hasn't used my preferred pronouns once in the almost 2 years that I've come out. Very few times I've made remarks that they are using the wrong pronoun, 99% I say nothing. This person is very conservative so I don't want to stress them. But it's kinda awkward for me to get misgendered, especially in times when I do pass. I'd already be grateful if it was just 50% of the time.

Hi everyone. I had no idea where else to ask and thought this might be the most suitable place for this kind of question. I've never viewed myself as trans. In the LGBT community I only fall under the bisexual category. But I've been having this strange... Urge? If that's the right word for it. 
I'm 19, female and I get these periods of time where I'm disgusted, ashamed of my female physique, female mindset, I can't even think about it. I become anxious and unmotivated to do anything at all, feel as if there's no point, I get this really strong urge to become male. It lasts for a while, destroys my sex drive, self confidence, motivation. To deal with it I either have to ignore it and patiently sit through it having trouble doing anything at all, or get into a male mindset and carry on until it passes. 
The most confusing thing about it - it comes and goes. It can last for days, weeks, months, but it always passes eventually. For more context, it's been happening since I was a child. And I know since it passes it might not be such a big deal but I'd just really like to know if anybody has dealt with this before?

I apologise if this was the wrong place to seek advice and if I don't understand this to a point where posting this here offended somebody. If anybody knows where else I can turn to I'm all up for suggestions.

2020-10-07 21:22:24,j6zqcy,0,1,"Okay so. I am a 15 year old FtM dude. I've decided this schoolyear willl be the year I finally come out as trans publicly. I have told my class and teachers about it, my friends already knew and currently I am trying to get to tell everyone I know so I don't have to go through getting deadnamed by literally **everybody** anymore.

Now here's my issue/question. I now want to come out to my boyfriend's family. For background info, we often all go to the restaurant together and since they don't know I'm trans, they deadname me, which is already bad enough. Well it isn't only that though. They have this awful ton of stereotypes, always telling my boyfriend to act more like a gentleman and shit like that, even though I am more that type of person in the relationship, I suppose. It is honestly stupid. Whenever I do anything on my own, his mom tells him he should offer me his help, even though I definitely don't need it. Me and my boyfriend know each other extremely well, so he knows that he doesn't have to ask every 5 seconds if I need help with something super minor, if I'd need help I ask. All of this sucks, so now I've decided I want to come out to them. 

But now here's the second issue. My boyfriend's family is pretty religious. I don't care if they don't accept me, but I am afraid they'd yell at my boy because of it. I still want and need to tell them though. 

So now, does anyone have any ideas on how I should even adress that? His parents seem to like me a lot by the way and I hope that won't change.

2020-10-07 23:05:06,j71jau,4,1,"As I remember when I was born and up till the age of 10, I identified as male and did all male stuff and was pretty content doing so.

Just before my 10th birthday, we decided to go on a road trip to Canberra, one that would end in disaster, changing my life forever. 

The car lost control on the highway and crashed into a tree, I was sitting on the side of impact, and suffered a traumatic brain injury.

When I woke in hospital I could still remember everything pre accident, I remembered my friends, my memories and home.

I had to stay in hospital for 3 months recovering and also had to move houses as our apartment we were at was deemed no longer safe for me by the doctors because it had a lot of stairs.

When I got out of hospital and was re introduced to gender roles I found myself acting more feminine and following my sisters in actions, but I thought nothing of it.

I also developed a limp and as an out patient I was diagnosed with muscle dystonia which meant I didn't have complete control over my muscles. Walking was exhausting for me and still very much is. We tried so many things, botox, acupuncture, herbal medicine, nothing was permanent enough.

When I entered High School I was bullied relentlessly for being different, even with my obvious disability. Kids are cruel, not to mention that I had gender dysphoria without knowing it.

My dad was abusive towards my mum and I would always have to hear him screaming and was scared of and hated him. Eventually he got divorced with my mum and moved to the UK.

In year 11, close to my 16th birthday, I finally decided to google ""Why do I feel like a girl?"", I then found out what being transgender was and could relate so much with everything I was reading.

By the time I was 17 I had an appointment with the gender centre(gender organisation in Australia) and they confirmed that I had gender dysphoria, but they said I had to wait until I was 18 to transition.

I ended up dropping out of high school in my final year because my mental health was so bad and the bullying was still on going. And had to do other courses to make up for it.

I was also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder as I was depressed for months and months on end. I even tried killing myself via carbon monoxide poisoning in 2019, which failed, luckily.

Due to distractions it took me until I turned 21 (2020) to transition, covid finally made me face myself, and now I'm 5 months on HRT and never been happier.

I skipped a lot but that's the gist of it.

Thanks for reading

Even before she ever came out as trans or even accepted it I could only ever treat her in a feminine way. I saw how she enjoyed it and loved that and I wanted to give her that happiness, even before we ever got together. 
My girlfriend is in the military, it’s a struggle being in the American military as a trans person since they’re banned. She deeply wants to serve, but she doesn’t know how long she can keep it up. 

I love her more than the sun itself, If everything else vanished it wouldn’t matter if I still had her. We are both usually opposed to the idea but we have agreed that we actually want to get married sometime in the future. Even though we aren’t that type. We never dreamed of getting married before but it’s not such a bad idea, she’s the right person for me.

She can’t come out to her folks, she’s afraid of being rejected. She says she will be disowned by her family and it’s a fear I’m glad I never had, but whenever she needs me I’m there. I’m there to tell her I love her and give her all the sweetness and love because getting her flustered and blushing and just feeling special is magical to me. 

Sometimes she needs support, a lot of support. Every day we call and there’s a different conversation about how she feels and I’m there to listen, she tells me she wants to kill herself and die and just not exist. I tell her please don’t, I’m greedy and I want her alive, because I love her so much.  
We both just understand each other and she gives me love and support.

She’s crying telling me I’m the one of her only reasons to live, that she loves me more than I could ever know. 
I’m crying too, just hearing her so sad is too much for me to bear.  I’d honestly do anything for her. 

I couldn’t imagine being by another person’s side. She means so much to me. She tells me she’s sorry that she’s crying so much, like it’s something so profoundly wrong. That sort of damage done over years of emotional repression... We both know it so well. 

We’re two broken halves to a wonderful whole. 
We both have our issues but everything is just so much better around each other.
I’m not sure if I said it but I’d do anything for her... I really would

So essentially, I feel like there is an expectation put upon trans people by the media and the general public, to be honest, to conform to gender stereotypes just because I say I am that gender. For example, the media seem to assume that just because I identify as a female that I love the colour pink and solely wear frilly dresses. And by extension, if I don't conform to these stereotypes, in my experience, people start to question whether or not i'm actually the gender I identify as. 

It is honestly so painful, frustrating and exhausting to have to constantly feel like I have to prove myself with literally every action I take, hobby I make, word I speak, etc. I just want to enjoy what I enjoy and I believe that just responding with ""well, just don't listen to them and do what you want"", but I think that comes from a place of privilege because have you ever been in that situation because there is only so far not caring about people's opinions goes. We are social creatures and so by design, inherently care about what our peers think about us.

2020-10-08 13:36:48,j7d5km,2,1,"Hey there!

I’m posting here today because well, I think I’m transgender. 

I am currently a cis male,  and I’ve been browsing this sub with r/egg_irl aswell for a while. trying to make up my mind and seek validation essentially to see if what I’m feeling is in fact dysphoria. The things that are stopping me from coming out essentially, or ask for a gender therapist are:

- People on YouTube comment sections saying how “where did all the tomboys go” meaning that being transgender isn’t real etc and 20 years ago you would just be called a tomboy or feminine guy and then move on and have a family,

- I feel for some reason I’d be embarrassed to tell my parents that I want to go on hormones or buy clothes (that my parents might mistake me for being gay or a fetish like crossdressing when really it’s neither - NOT saying that being gay is a bad thing I meant that they would think I’m some kind of fetish person not sure sorry don’t take offence to this)
 
And lastly what people around me like family or school friends would think.

The weird part about it all is it feels like I’m just “alright” in my actual body. Well sort of at least. I want to be a woman. 

I have PTSD from past abuse and depression, they are the huge things that make me rethink if I want to actually transition or try out clothes of the opposite gender etc. which brings me onto my next point:

I could just have ocd and be overthinking it all. 

All I’m gonna say is when I’m around other guys I keep like kinda trembling or really stressing about everything I say or do. It’s like wearing a mask and I listen to my voice and I feel so insecure for some unknown reason. It feels like I need to act to be like a guy maybe I’m not sure but I do act. When I’m around women I kind of feel shy, not the same - I got social anxiety lol so i don’t talk to neither but however I feel way more easily like a hugging feeling not sure how to explain but that they will look after me unlike to being around guys- ANYWAY IM WEIRD AS FUCK SAYING THIS LOL SORRY! 

My point I’m tryna get at is I think maybe because I have been bullied in the past by guys and girls, I have low self esteem around both since also a figure has particularly abused me I feel inferior to everyone. 
In saying that I feel like if I take hormones I’ll be comfortable and I’m honestly not sure where I’m going with this all I’m so so sorry to anyone who has read this far. I just feel depressed sometimes thinking I’ve somehow faked myself into dysphoria and I’ve read so many people turning being transgender into a political statement which makes me feel disgusting but I’m not doing it for that or just to be different, I am feeling this way because I am different to people around me and I think I always been.

hi everyone, im ftm myself but my friend (B) who was assigned male at birth is questioning and I want to be able to support them.   


B did ask that i refer to him using male pronouns despite him questioning, so from now on in this post, that's what i'll do.  


B has been depressed for as long as we've been friends, but in quarantine things really spiked up.  
he's been drinking (i should also mention that B and I are teens, definitely not of drinking age) and that he tried smoking more than once, and even pressed the bunt to his own body multiple times, creating dark circles on his torso.  


needless to say, i am really worried about B.  he doesn't have a plan for suicide but i'm concerned that B could have one in the future if there isn't an intervention.  


now, genderwise B has told me that if he could wake up in a female body no questions asked, no repercussions, that B absolutely would. this already sends red flags to me as someone who might be trans, so I'm thinking that B may be an egg. I would send B to egg\_irl but there's some toxic people there that I don't want to subject him to. B has also said that he doesn't want to be in the icky transition phase of being seen as a guy pretending to be a girl, he just wants to be seen as a girl, not a trans girl.   


(eugh I feel really bad using the he/him pronouns for B, but he specifically asked me to refer to him that way)

I am an assistant manager who is newly promoted and needs help.  I have an associate (let's call them Kai) that is transgender, passes well and unfortunately some of the documents shows their deadname until their name is legally changed.  Another associate (let's call them Kelly) has access to said documents and started to question Kai in front of other associates and customers.  Kai told Kelly not to worry about it and that these were invasive and inappropriate questions, to which Kelly continued to question.  Kai knows I am an ally and came to me to vent and for advice.  They told me this was the most uncomfortable situation they've experienced.  I told Kai that I would talk to Kelly if they want, that they can talk to Kelly, or the two of them can sit down with another manager as a mediator to talk (being newly promoted i do not feel comfortable being a mediator).  I told them to think about what they want to to do and I will back them up 100%.  My associates are like my children and I want to make sure I am there for them.  What can I do to assist Kai?  What can I do to educate Kelly?  I don't want the burden of educating someone else to fall on Kai's shoulders at least not alone.

So, to quickly summarise; it's a crime/detective thing and somebody has reopened a ten-year-old cold case involving the disappearance of a young girl, by accusing her childhood friend. Things happen, mysteries are solved, the small community is (un)surprisingly hiding dark secrets and nobody has told the truth about a single thing. Your standard fare.

This is relevant to this subreddit because the individual who went missing, returns, but they're not a girl, and in the ten years they've been gone, they've transitioned. He's returned to see if his family is interested in being part of his life again, and 'coincidentally' in time to clear his friend's name.

I'm mostly unsure of this idea because it kind of forces him to out himself, but he was coming back to reconnect with his family anyway, and I'm also really wary of him being more of a plot device than a character.

2020-10-11 07:57:19,j91fm2,2,1,"Reposting this here from AskTrans because I wanna get this message to the folks who need to see it.

I've gone to basically every end of the internet for 3 years researching and learning about things because I've been wanting to figure out what really means I'm ""really trans or not"". Some people say you need dysphoria, some people say you don't, some people go in depth to call out trans people as ""trenders"" or as AGP. You don't need to go to all of these lengths battling yourself over if you deserve to be happy or if you're ""not trans"" and need to repress your feelings or something. And after all this searching, a catharsis, and a whole lotta therapy, I learned a few things that will save people a LOT OF TIME.

So, for your sake, please listen up.

If you're questioning, stop now for a moment and acknowledge your AGAB. You WERE born that way, you will always have BEEN born that way. Your body has formed in a way dictated by your sex. But, your birth gender means fuck all to your actual gender experience.

Literally everyone has a different experience of gender, not just trans people. Look at any cis person. Do other people of their gender present the same as them? Is there just ""one proper way"" that they all present? OF COURSE NOT! Because the thing is, gender means NOTHING unless you're not allowed or able to express it.

You know the discomfort a masculine girl might have wearing a frilly dress? THAT'S DYSPHORIA. If she went ""wow I sure do think a men's suit would look cool"", that would be euphoria, the alleviation of gender discomfort by chasing after things that let her better express herself. The medical definition of ""gender dysphoria"" is stupid because LITERALLY all it means is that you aren't expressing your gender properly. So if you have ""euphoria"" that makes you feel like you're finally presenting in a way that lines up with your gender, congratulations, you're a person who wants to handle their gender differently whether you're ""cis"" or not.

You NEED to start asking, ""What would make me feel better?"".

Cis people take action all the time to alleviate gender discomfort. So you should too, cis or not. Does that involve anything you would label as ""gender transition""? Then congratulations, you're trans! That's literally all it means! Stop asking if you aren't, because if you're cis and asking yourself this, your mind is still telling you to fix something whether it requires transition or not.

Figure out WHAT those things are, trans or cis or whatever, and TAKE THEM. If you're stuck in the closet, at the very least you can find comfort in the little things since you'll find them once you stop fighting yourself.

YOU NEED TO STOP COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE. You are not other people. You are you. Being cis or trans means nothing to your internal sense of gender. It is yours alone. Stop comparing yourself. If you are trans you will never be cis, in the same way a cis person will never be the same as any other cis person. Do you not feel like other people of your AGAB? Then stop comparing yourself to people of your desired gender/expression because no person is ""like"" another person. You will never feel like someone else. You feel like yourself, and only you feel that way. Your life is yours, so take it into your own hands NOW and don't wait to figure out labels until you know how you want to express yourself. Transition is nothing but a means to an end of some people's best expression.

(Also stop asking yourself if it's a sex thing. If it's only a sex thing and you get discomfort then find what works and change your expression in bed, cis or trans or whatever. Just like before, try some things and find what works best. Don't bother with fretting about AGP stuff because that's a non-starter made by a doink who wants to make everyone with a kink to feel bad about themselves, cis or not.

Just look for your lighthouse, and start sailing, no matter where it lands you, trans or not. We're all still just people looking to live our lives best as possible- so stop worrying about labels and start taking action!

Here's my advice that will save you possibly years of being stuck in a personal hell. (Others feel free to chime in with advice too.)",1602428239.0,"{'created_utc': 1602403039, 'id': 'j91fm2', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Reposting this here from AskTrans because I wanna get this message to the folks who need to see it.\n\nI\'ve gone to basically every end of the internet for 3 years researching and learning about things because I\'ve been wanting to figure out what really means I\'m ""really trans or not"". Some people say you need dysphoria, some people say you don\'t, some people go in depth to call out trans people as ""trenders"" or as AGP. You don\'t need to go to all of these lengths battling yourself over if you deserve to be happy or if you\'re ""not trans"" and need to repress your feelings or something. And after all this searching, a catharsis, and a whole lotta therapy, I learned a few things that will save people a LOT OF TIME.\n\nSo, for your sake, please listen up.\n\nIf you\'re questioning, stop now for a moment and acknowledge your AGAB. You WERE born that way, you will always have BEEN born that way. Your body has formed in a way dictated by your sex. But, your birth gender means fuck all to your actual gender experience.\n\nLiterally everyone has a different experience of gender, not just trans people. Look at any cis person. Do other people of their gender present the same as them? Is there just ""one proper way"" that they all present? OF COURSE NOT! Because the thing is, gender means NOTHING unless you\'re not allowed or able to express it.\n\nYou know the discomfort a masculine girl might have wearing a frilly dress? THAT\'S DYSPHORIA. If she went ""wow I sure do think a men\'s suit would look cool"", that would be euphoria, the alleviation of gender discomfort by chasing after things that let her better express herself. The medical definition of ""gender dysphoria"" is stupid because LITERALLY all it means is that you aren\'t expressing your gender properly. So if you have ""euphoria"" that makes you feel like you\'re finally presenting in a way that lines up with your gender, congratulations, you\'re a person who wants to handle their gender differently whether you\'re ""cis"" or not.\n\nYou NEED to start asking, ""What would make me feel better?"".\n\nCis people take action all the time to alleviate gender discomfort. So you should too, cis or not. Does that involve anything you would label as ""gender transition""? Then congratulations, you\'re trans! That\'s literally all it means! Stop asking if you aren\'t, because if you\'re cis and asking yourself this, your mind is still telling you to fix something whether it requires transition or not.\n\nFigure out WHAT those things are, trans or cis or whatever, and TAKE THEM. If you\'re stuck in the closet, at the very least you can find comfort in the little things since you\'ll find them once you stop fighting yourself.\n\nYOU NEED TO STOP COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE. You are not other people. You are you. Being cis or trans means nothing to your internal sense of gender. It is yours alone. Stop comparing yourself. If you are trans you will never be cis, in the same way a cis person will never be the same as any other cis person. Do you not feel like other people of your AGAB? Then stop comparing yourself to people of your desired gender/expression because no person is ""like"" another person. You will never feel like someone else. You feel like yourself, and only you feel that way. Your life is yours, so take it into your own hands NOW and don\'t wait to figure out labels until you know how you want to express yourself. Transition is nothing but a means to an end of some people\'s best expression.\n\n(Also stop asking yourself if it\'s a sex thing. If it\'s only a sex thing and you get discomfort then find what works and change your expression in bed, cis or trans or whatever. Just like before, try some things and find what works best. Don\'t bother with fretting about AGP stuff because that\'s a non-starter made by a doink who wants to make everyone with a kink to feel bad about themselves, cis or not. If you have a kink, enjoy it like anyone else would with any other safe and innocuous part of their sexuality.

2020-10-11 21:54:24,j9edeh,3,1," I'm pre-HRT and have been wishing to be a girl since I was young, like maybe 8 and then these feelings getting stronger as I've aged. Being a girl is on my mind all day every day and I'm really making steps to transtioning fully and intend to start HRT as soon as I can. I have social media accounts as a girl, email addresses, clothes, have online friends that know me as only Seren which I like.

I have concerns though, things that hold me back. Firstly, I look pretty passable from the front with light makeup as you can see in my pics but I feel that from certain angles and from the side I look masculine, especially my mouth and nose. I want to blend in and really fear being constantly spotted, stared at, commented on in public. I don't think I'd handle that well. I worry what I would look like in natural daylight. I have pondered before about going out in public, maybe just to use the campus library, but I'm way too self-conscious and scared of feeling like everybody is looking at me, joking, commenting. 

There is also the whole family thing. I have come out to lots of people about dressing female but they just think I crossdress. I haven't told anybody but my counsellour that I have always desired to be a girl. I bought it up in conversation to my mum recently asking ""what would you do if I transitioned?"" Jokingly...and she told me how hard it would be, that she would be mourning the loss of her son like he had died. It puts me off, I really want to just blend in and ease into it without any drama but I know that I would be the centre of so much negative attention within my wider family and friends etc.

I'm also pretty poor, at university and definitely can't afford the surgeries that I feel would make me so much more content with my appearance.

Then there's the whole feeling of not being trans enough. It changes. Sometimes I just feel so depressed, suicidal at the fact that I'm male and I've basically stopped going out in public and socialising with others because I've become so discontent with being me and become totally introverted. The other day I was dressed feminine, and sitting at my mirror crying and asking myself why I couldn't have just been born this way. But then there are times in which I wonder if I'm feeling so strongly about it because all I do is sit in my room thinking about it. Maybe if I had a social life, a partner, friends, hobbies...then I wouldn't feel it.

I'm just so confused and feel like there is an obstacle in my path, which is myself. I don't think I'm strong enough to do this even though it's 100% what I'd like to do. It could make me so happy on the inside and content with myself but also make my life hell.",trans,Feel like I'm my own obstacle,1602478464.0,"{'created_utc': 1602453264, 'id': 'j9edeh', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ' I\'m pre-HRT and have been wishing to be a girl since I was young, like maybe 8 and then these feelings getting stronger as I\'ve aged.

2020-10-12 05:47:42,j9lazw,2,1,"Hi,
I hope this is an acceptable post. Not sure where else would be better to ask.
I’m very certain my online friend is trans. She has hinted at it in (kind of evident) ways. It only matters in the sense it matters to her (and other people), and therefore matters to me. I want our relationship to be one where we can tell each other stuff that’s bothering us.

Tobey has helped me so much and given me an identity but now that I’m in this indecisive area I feel like I’m losing my identity. I’m really struggling and I’m going back into a bad mindset with thoughts of hurting myself.

The last week I met a trans woman (I don’t know whether such term is respectful or not) online, specifically in Badoo. When it came the first conversation, I asked her “What if we get know each other, what can possibly go wrong?”. And everything hereinafter was wrapped up nevertheless she seemed to be somewhat uncomfortable or perhaps didn’t use to such conversations because she replied me “I don’t know” a lot of times and when I said her whether she wanted to know about me, she only asked “what kind of movies do I like?” and “what’s your favourite colour?” And I told her if she wanted to know something else and her answer was again the same “I don’t know”.

In addition, I knew she’s a “sex worker” for a living thus the average relationship between a guy and a worker is sometimes kinda awkward, abusive, disrespectful and destructive; however I’m not interested in pursuing anything related to sexual services but to develop a real friendship with a real woman nevertheless she’s having a tough time when it comes to trust me, hence I’d like to know what I can perhaps do to gain her trust.

But my gf is. (MtF, presenting male) She is not comfortable with herself, and I have no idea how to help her with this issue. It breaks my heart to see her in pain but I have never had any particular issue with gender or body-image so gender dysphoria is not something I can relate to. She's also frequently concerned she's not valid, which I can relate to but still don't know how to give any comfort in. 

For the record, I have no issue with her gender transformation, which I mention because we started dating before this was a thing I knew about.

I just really want to know how I can help her through this difficult period because she is in a great deal of pain and I have no words to help her feel better. I don't know a great deal about the time period a transition takes either, but she's been on HRT for about ten months and there have definitely been changes. (But I'm really bad with describing the human body so it's hard for me to explain what I see that is so different. Whereas she knows that exact ratio of measurements for everything to look 'right.')

I finally decided to get a therapist and actually try to right myself a couple of years ago.  She's been wonderful, though I haven't seen her since February.

Tonight I happened to look at the mirror at just the right time without actually trying to and saw who I was, quickly and without gazing, criticizing, analyzing, and there, before I knew what was happening, I smiled.

I will apologize in advance if I mess up any terms as I'm still learning. For the purpose of this post, I will use she/her, but that is not a sign of disrespect of her wishes.

I am a single mum of an almost 14 year old girl. I have noticed for a few years now that she seems gender fluid. She mostly dresses in loose t-shirts/hoodies and loose cotton shorts. Her hair has been shorter and shorter until we had a discussion this summer and we decided to buzz her hair off (and she looks fabulous!).

Honestly, I have been fully expecting a they/them conversation to happen for over a year now. However, she came to me a week ago after a discussion about whether she would want to wear a dress with the demonia boots that she has asked me for for her birthday and told me she doesn't feel comfortable in dresses because she feels like a boy.

Since then, we've had a number of conversations. Please note that this have been pleasant conversations and there are no feelings of angst or upset on either side, during the conversations or after.  

My concern is walking a line between trying to help her understand how she is feeling and respecting her narrative. She's had some mental health issues and I'm paying for a psychologist, and I suggested that she speak to them and walk through her feelings before we make any major changes. I also suggested that she look through lists of gender neutral names and find something that calls to her. I asked her about binding or further steps (she has a condition that requires an endocrinologist who also happens to be the major expert for transgender in our area), but she says she's experiencing no gender dysphoria. 

I'm concerned that with no changes to her body and the fact that she makes more masculine feeling choices some days and more feminine feeling choices others that it will be difficult for others to accept the decision to identify as male, and I don't want her to feel unsupported when she already has existing mental health issues.

Am I wrong for trying to help her understand what these choices mean and gently encouraging a more gender fluid choice?

There's been a bit of a shake-up within the animation industry recently, concerning characters of colour.

2020-10-13 23:41:42,japb90,5,1,"H'lo

I'm 16 and considering a mtf transition. I came out to my friend, then my mother shortly after. This was a while ago, so I can't remember the exact wording, but it was generally positive, with her saying that she'd accept me if it was either just a phase or not just a phase

today, since it'd been a while, I brought it back up, and said there were up to 10 year long waiting lists and I'd like to join the waiting list, since I'd be able to just bail if I'm not trans. She then responded about how I'm not old enough to make big decisions like that. I tried to explain that it meant that I would be deciding later because of the long waiting times, but then she said that I'd know when I'm 30??

Personally I think that's bullshit. I don't want to live through another 19 years of my life not being me because I'm not an arbitrary number, I understand I might be too young to make any rash decisions, but I'm really not sure how to go forward with this. She isn't anti-LGBT or anything and she really doesn't mean to be harsh, but when I'm actually talking to her I just nod and agree then after realize how little was said because I don't want to argue about it, I don't want me being trans to become an argument or have bad connotations

I'm really not sure. I feel she believes it's just a phase, and that might be right, but I'd like to explore it to find if it's a phase or not, which I can't do... you get where I'm coming from?

I know there's a lot of things I can do with clothes to help shape my body. I tried on some more outfits and they looked much better. That was just a really rough moment for me.

TL;DR: Broke out of denial around my being trans, seeking support in friends and communities. Wanted to share my story and feel that I'm a part of something.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always thought that what I was feeling was normal. I thought that every guy must be a little curious about girls, want to be one a little, but it would pass. I know it sounds cliche, but I thought it would just be a phase. Now I know that it's not.

I guess I'd known for a while. I had been interested in becoming a girl for years, but I had never considered myself trans. More recently, whenever I had been playing a video game that asked you to pick your character's gender, I'd pick female. I wouldn't even put in (what I thought was)my own name. I'd put in Brielle. Not too different from ""my name"" but it was distinctly female. I had been wearing girlier and girlier clothes in Animal Crossing New Horizons, made friends with a group of people who also played it. An hour or so after we met, they asked me my pronouns. I said she/hers. I was still in denial. I was in the closet so much that I couldn't see the walls lol.

Two days after that, I was browsing the internet when I found out it was National Coming Out Day. Eventually, I decided something. I decided that I might be trans. I wasn't positive, still aren't tbh. I also decided that I had to have some way to keep myself honest, to make sure that I didn't just drop back into denial. I had to explore the emotions and feelings I was having, no matter what. And so I came out to the one person I knew who knew what I was going through. I came out to my closest friend, a trans man, who once came out to me.

He was as supportive as supportive could be. His first reply shot any doubts I had, as he told me that it takes a long time to figure out and that he was glad I was 'putting words to the feeling.' Since then, he's been a font of information, as I've asked questions about picking my name, finding support, and the general journey.

So far, I've been exploring possibilities as to where my being trans could take me, and just exploring the communities of people like me I never knew that I should have been a part of. I've been trying to find my name (I'd love any tips you guys could give me about that.) and become more comfortable with who I am, and hopefully be comfortable enough to come out to my mom, my other friends.

I don't know where I'll be in the future, or even who I'll be, but I'm excited to be a part of this group of kings, queens, and in-betweens!

Wait until you have secured the job and have started working before using your preferred name and gender. (this means asking everyone to call me something different to how I introduced myself).

tldr; during my cosmetology apprenticeships a lot of bad stuff happened to me. Is continuing to pursue a career in cosmetology worth it? 

cw: transphobia/racism/ableism

I have been in the cosmetology industry for three years: in school for two years and assisting for a year and a half. I was fired on new years eve from the first job (a barbering apprenticeship); six months into working there and a week after asking them to use my pronouns. I was given no explanation when I asked. 

I had to leave the second job (a curly apprenticeship where I got my DevaCurl cert and Ouidad Rake and Shake cert) after ten months of nothing being done about the constant teasing concerning my sexuality and gender in Spanish. I was made fun of for not being a good sport. I also don't speak Spanish. 

I was fired from my third job (a blonding apprenticeship) after four months when I had an anxiety attack due to listening to a client talk about ""transvestites"" for an hour and a second (white) client going off on me because I passively mentioned that reverse racism wasn't real. I went to the backroom when I started feeling anxious, as I had previously discussed with my boss. The owner (who was not my boss) came back and started yelling at me to clean which triggered a full fledged panic attack where I blacked out in the bathroom for an hour. Then the owner literally chased me out of the backroom into the parking lot when I told him I needed some time to calm down before we had a conversation about what happened. He then bullied my boss into terminating me, threatening her position at the salon. That's when I learned a company needs at least 15 employees to be sued for discrimination. 

I have spent so much time and money and love into learning this craft only to find the industry incredibly punitive. I don't know if it was my location (Miami, FL) or if it's the industry in general. I'm moving to to another city (Philadelphia, PA) soon and I don't know if it will be different there or if it's an industry issue. 

I don't see transmasc people in the industry or on social media and I don't have the emotional or psychological capacity to sit in a salon for 8-10 hours, five days a week educating people on how to be nice to me when the focus should be on my expertise and what I have to offer. I understand that prejudice happens. I don't want it happening 24/7. I also don't have the access or ability to build a business on my own and if I were to continue in this career I would need to be in a salon to build my clientele. 

It's been eight months since I was last in a salon. I stay current on hair trends and continue to watch and listen to educational videos and podcasts despite the fact that I left social media because of how upset seeing other stylists made me. I do see the irony in it and I laugh at myself all the time. I also have continued to cut hair on v rare occasions for people I know who are immunocompromised, as well as maintaining the color and cut of my partner's and my hair. 

In the past eight months I've been studying computer programming because I don't feel like I'll ever be safe in a salon setting again; and I can't get into it mostly because I'm having trouble letting go of my love and desire to do hair. 

I honestly think I would be fine if I had at least one actual ally, but my experience indicates that desire as unrealistic. 

I really hope it's not the only truth, but that's why I'm here. 

Any seasoned stylists with realistic advice? I'm high-functioning, but neurodivergent and have c-ptsd so I literally will not be okay if I continue to work in spaces like the ones I've been in. It's taken months to stop having nightmares of someone chasing me out of a job and I know I will not be the same if traumatizing events continue to occur. Will I always run the risk of the things that have happened to me in salons if I continue to pursue this career? Is there a net of support that I can fall into? 

I just need to know if this is something that I need to move on from and let go of or if there is space for a person like me in this industry. I'm okay with letting go. It's not the first career that I've fallen in love with and had to leave because of obstacles like this.

I also have continued to cut hair on v rare occasions for people I know who are immunocompromised, as well as maintaining the color and cut of my partner\'s and my hair. \n\nIn the past eight months I\'ve been studying computer programming because I don\'t feel like I\'ll ever be safe in a salon setting again; and I can\'t get into it mostly because I\'m having trouble letting go of my love and desire to do hair. \n\nI honestly think I would be fine if I had at least one actual ally, but my experience indicates that desire as unrealistic. \n\nI really hope it\'s not the only truth, but that\'s why I\'m here. \n\nAny seasoned stylists with realistic advice? I\'m high-functioning, but neurodivergent and have c-ptsd so I literally will not be okay if I continue to work in spaces like the ones I\'ve been in. It\'s taken months to stop having nightmares of someone chasing me out of a job and I know I will not be the same if traumatizing events continue to occur. Will I always run the risk of the things that have happened to me in salons if I continue to pursue this career? Is there a net of support that I can fall into? \n\nI just need to know if this is something that I need to move on from and let go of or if there is space for a person like me in this industry. I\'m okay with letting go. It\'s not the first career that I\'ve fallen in love with and had to leave because of obstacles like this. I just wanted to give it one last shot.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Advice from other stylists?', 'created': 1602712527.0}"

So I recently outed myself to my close family and will start HRT soon. Though I feel so terrified and happy at the same time. I'm so worried about my social life and what it will look like after I out myself to the world. Growing up, I was never really social and couldn't start and keep a lot of meaningful friendships. My closest friends were and still are guys. And this worries me so much. I really really want to have more girlfriends but right now, I'm so awkward around most girls and it makes me feel really dysphoric. I feel like I would make good friends with shy girls, because I'm shy myself, but that's the problem: I'm way to fucking nervous to talk to them. I also never know what to say. Some girls like to talk about typical 'girly stuff' (make up, gossip, ...). I don't really feel like I'm into that stuff. I don't see myself as very girly, maybe that's why? Idk... I feel like maybe this will all go a lot easier once I explain my full situation but still... Very nervous about all of that.

I think the reason I'm not very social is because I never was able to really be myself, and that's fucking exhausting. My social batteries quickly run out after a night out of pretending to be someone I'm not. Maybe that's also the reason why I can't really connect with other people? Idk tho

2020-10-14 19:43:53,jb7xu3,5,1,"So I've been questioning my gender for years. Like 3-4 years. I had a friend who was a trans male at the time (I'm pretty sure they are female now like they use she/her pronouns and don't like he/him pronouns). I started doing research on gender identities and told my mom that I thought I was genderfluid. I might have worded what I was trying to say incorrectly because she told me that ""just because you like dressing like a boy doesn't mean you are a boy."" She used my cisgender aunt as an example and said that just because she was a ""tomboy"", it didn't mean she was transgender. I felt hurt and like she didn't understand me. I felt like my identity was invalidated.

I kept experimenting with clothing, wearing ""guys"" clothing that I got handed down to me from my cousins. I tucked my hair into beanies and felt happy that I looked like a guy. I don't think I felt uncomfortable with she/her pronouns during this time, but I always felt strange thinking about certain things. Like I would think ""I'm a girl"", and it would just feel weird to think about. Hearing my feminine name made me feel weird, and I often felt as if that wasn't my name. When I heard people say my name when I had to introduce myself... I just felt so weird and uncomfortable. 

I was always a very masculine person. I hung out with boys and girls, but I felt more connected to the boys than the girls. In my school there  was a ""boys table"" and a ""girls table"", and I usually sat at the girl's table. But once I felt comfortable and confident enough to sit at the boy's table, and so I did. I sat down next to my classmate, who was confused on why I was at the boy's table. The boys asked me why I was there, and I jokingly put my hair up and the boy who was sitting next to me said, ""she's a boy!"" It sounds to me so stupid, so foolish, but at the time I was overjoyed. I couldn't really tell why. 

I often preferred hanging out with my dad and brother and doing stereotypically masculine things. I felt more connected to them, and when I thought of myself, I usually thought of myself as ""one of the guys."" This is why I felt more connected to guys than girls, I decided.

When I looked at myself in the mirror, I often asked myself who was this person that was looking back at me. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It all felt so strange and unfamiliar. I thought to myself, "" who is this GIRL looking back at me?"" I couldn't believe that the girl in the mirror was me. I felt strange and weird to think of the me in the mirror as a girl.

Whenever I went to parties, I often wore dresses with white stockings/tights underneath. I felt uncomfortable and awkward and looking back at old pictures of myself, it was obvious that something wasn't right.  I never asked to wear anything other than dresses during this time, because I thought that I had to wear only dresses. Of course, no one ever told me that I had to wear only dresses; I just assumed that I had to, I guess because a lot of the people at the parties wore ""men's"" and ""women's"" clothes if they were cisgender male or cisgender female. 

Once, I asked my mother if I could wear a suit or pantsuit next time I went to parties. She had nothing against it and jokingly asked if I was a lesbian. 

I discovered BTS and loved the way they looked so feminine, yet so masculine at the same time. I listened to K-Pop and was a fan of some girl groups, like Mamamoo and Blackpink, but whenever I thought of who I wanted to look and be like, I usually thought of male K-pop idols. Of course, there were times when I wanted to look like female idols because they looked so feminine and my face was an ugly mixture of masculine and feminine. 

I think I wanted to be like BTS because they just seemed so comfortable and confident and who they were. They seemed comfortable and confident as cisgender men, and that was appealing to me. I wanted to be comfortable in my gender, in who I was. 

I learned about transgender women. I was proud of them for being able to live as who they were, to be confident in who they were. I also wanted to be like them; I wanted to know what my gender identity was, and to be comfortable and confident that THAT'S what my gender identity was. I was and still do support transgender women (trans women are women!!!), but I always asked myself, ""why would anyone want to be a woman?"" Of course, at this time, I was still pretty uneducated and didn't know that they didn't want to be women; they were women. They didn't choose to be women, because that's who they were all along. But the thought of someone who was AMAB transitioning always made me ask that question: ""Why would anyone want to be a woman?""

I remember taking part in a play, where there were some younger and older kids. One of the little girls asked me if I was a boy because I ""sounded like a boy."" I kept telling her that I wasn't a boy, I was a girl, but she insisted that I was a boy, using it as an insult against me, taunting me. I thought about this a lot; I even cried about it, though it sounded so stupid. Why was I crying about a little girl calling me a boy? 

In the summer, when I didn't have to wear a uniform to school and worry about whether people would think I was weird for expressing myself in the ways that I did, I sometimes locked myself in my room and tried on the masculine clothes that I had. I tied up my hair to make it look short. I took pictures of myself and videos too. I felt so happy when I saw that I looked like a boy. I cried and had anxiety attacks when I realized that I didn't know what my gender was and that I wished I was born a boy.

I think its important to mention that throughout the years, I have dressed in both masculine and feminine ways. There were some times that I felt uncomfortable dressing in masculine ways, and some times that my confidence shot through the roof. It was the same for when I dressed in feminine ways too. There were periods of time when I dressed and acted in a super feminine way, and I often felt like I was doing this  to hold onto my femininity.

I later cut my hair, and I was so happy that I did it. I started expressing myself in more masculine ways. People complimented me on my hair. It felt good being who I was.

After cutting my hair, I found that I was being misgendered often. My eye doctor, who couldn't recognize me, came to my school and referred with he/him pronouns. My brother's classmate asked, in front of me and my brother, ""is that a girl or a boy"", and when my brother replied ""that's a girl"", the kid was in shock. ""That's a girl?"" he asked, as if he couldn't believe it. Someone passed by me in the hallway at school and whispered, ""he looks like someone I know."" 

When my eye doctor misgendered me, I told my friend, and anxiously asked her if I looked like a boy. She said no. She asked me how I felt about him misgendering me, and I replied that I didn't really care. I think I was kind of numb at the time; I had never been misgendered the way he misgendered me before, and it was a weird feeling. If I was a cisgender female, why didn't I care that I had just been misgendered???

When my brother's classmate misgendered me, I felt embarrassed. I felt like I was an ugly girl, because some kid couldn't tell if I was a guy or girl. I was anxious about being misgendered, and broke down crying when I got home from school. 

When I was misgendered by someone at school, I didn't really care at first. But I started thinking about it after it happened, and I realized that I wasn't totally uncomfortable with he/him pronouns; of course, I had been using she/her pronouns all my life, so it was a little weird to have them suddenly being used for me without my consent. I asked my mom to use he/him pronouns for me, and I could feel my heart pounding when I sent that text. She started texting back questions I was uncomfortable answering, so I dropped it and tried to forget about it. 

Recently, I started to identify myself as a masculine-leaning bigender person, but that label didn't feel quite right at the time. I started identifying myself as genderfluid, but something still felt off. I decided that my gender didn't really matter; I'm a person, that was the answer that I decided I would give to people who asked if I was a boy or girl. I thought I was a trans guy, but then I realized that I still wanted to be a girl sometimes. 

I started feeling dysphoria. I mean, I guess I've always felt it. I've always felt a little uncomfortable in tight shirts that showed my chest, and I felt uncomfortable in skirts, dresses, and tight clothes made for girls. But I started feeling and really noticing my dysphoria towards things I had never been dysphoric about before. I couldn't listen to female rappers or singers. I couldn't wear certain shoes because they were ""girls shoes."" I was uncomfortable seeing my name on Zoom, hearing my teachers say my name, and hearing them refer to me with she/her pronouns.

I'd also like to mention that I tried packing yesterday with socks. I felt happy seeing a bulge there, since I often felt like something was missing down there.

I found a safe place for me, the Sexuality and Gender Alliance club at my high school. I started going by a name that I decided was unisex, and started using he/him pronouns. Right now, I am happy with where I am. I am a person, and my gender does not really define me, though at times it seems like it does. 

If you read all the way here, thank you. Thank you for giving me an outlet to share my story. Thank you for allowing me to share your story with you. Thank you for hearing me, for listening to me.

I hung out with boys and girls, but I felt more connected to the boys than the girls. In my school there  was a ""boys table"" and a ""girls table"", and I usually sat at the girl\'s table. But once I felt comfortable and confident enough to sit at the boy\'s table, and so I did. I sat down next to my classmate, who was confused on why I was at the boy\'s table. The boys asked me why I was there, and I jokingly put my hair up and the boy who was sitting next to me said, ""she\'s a boy!"" It sounds to me so stupid, so foolish, but at the time I was overjoyed. I couldn\'t really tell why. \n\nI often preferred hanging out with my dad and brother and doing stereotypically masculine things. I felt more connected to them, and when I thought of myself, I usually thought of myself as ""one of the guys."" This is why I felt more connected to guys than girls, I decided.\n\nWhen I looked at myself in the mirror, I often asked myself who was this person that was looking back at me. I couldn\'t believe what I was seeing. It all felt so strange and unfamiliar. I thought to myself, "" who is this GIRL looking back at me?"" I couldn\'t believe that the girl in the mirror was me. I felt strange and weird to think of the me in the mirror as a girl.\n\nWhenever I went to parties, I often wore dresses with white stockings/tights underneath. I felt uncomfortable and awkward and looking back at old pictures of myself, it was obvious that something wasn\'t right.  I never asked to wear anything other than dresses during this time, because I thought that I had to wear only dresses. Of course, no one ever told me that I had to wear only dresses; I just assumed that I had to, I guess because a lot of the people at the parties wore ""men\'s"" and ""women\'s"" clothes if they were cisgender male or cisgender female. \n\nOnce, I asked my mother if I could wear a suit or pantsuit next time I went to parties. She had nothing against it and jokingly asked if I was a lesbian. \n\nI discovered BTS and loved the way they looked so feminine, yet so masculine at the same time. I listened to K-Pop and was a fan of some girl groups, like Mamamoo and Blackpink, but whenever I thought of who I wanted to look and be like, I usually thought of male K-pop idols. Of course, there were times when I wanted to look like female idols because they looked so feminine and my face was an ugly mixture of masculine and feminine. \n\nI think I wanted to be like BTS because they just seemed so comfortable and confident and who they were. They seemed comfortable and confident as cisgender men, and that was appealing to me. I wanted to be comfortable in my gender, in who I was. \n\nI learned about transgender women. I was proud of them for being able to live as who they were, to be confident in who they were. I also wanted to be like them; I wanted to know what my gender identity was, and to be comfortable and confident that THAT\'S what my gender identity was. I was and still do support transgender women (trans women are women!!!), but I always asked myself, ""why would anyone want to be a woman?"" Of course, at this time, I was still pretty uneducated and didn\'t know that they didn\'t want to be women; they were women. They didn\'t choose to be women, because that\'s who they were all along. But the thought of someone who was AMAB transitioning always made me ask that question: ""Why would anyone want to be a woman?""\n\nI remember taking part in a play, where there were some younger and older kids. One of the little girls asked me if I was a boy because I ""sounded like a boy."" I kept telling her that I wasn\'t a boy, I was a girl, but she insisted that I was a boy, using it as an insult against me, taunting me. I thought about this a lot; I even cried about it, though it sounded so stupid. Why was I crying about a little girl calling me a boy? \n\nIn the summer, when I didn\'t have to wear a uniform to school and worry about whether people would think I was weird for expressing myself in the ways that I did, I sometimes locked myself in my room and tried on the masculine clothes that I had. I tied up my hair to make it look short. I took pictures of myself and videos too. I felt so happy when I saw that I looked like a boy. I cried and had anxiety attacks when I realized that I didn\'t know what my gender was and that I wished I was born a boy.\n\nI think its important to mention that throughout the years, I have dressed in both masculine and feminine ways. There were some times that I felt uncomfortable dressing in masculine ways, and some times that my confidence shot through the roof. It was the same for when I dressed in feminine ways too. There were periods of time when I dressed and acted in a super feminine way, and I often felt like I was doing this  to hold onto my femininity.\n\nI later cut my hair, and I was so happy that I did it. I started expressing myself in more masculine ways. People complimented me on my hair. It felt good being who I was.\n\nAfter cutting my hair, I found that I was being misgendered often. My eye doctor, who couldn\'t recognize me, came to my school and referred with he/him pronouns. My brother\'s classmate asked, in front of me and my brother, ""is that a girl or a boy"", and when my brother replied ""that\'s a girl"", the kid was in shock. ""That\'s a girl?"" he asked, as if he couldn\'t believe it. Someone passed by me in the hallway at school and whispered, ""he looks like someone I know."" \n\nWhen my eye doctor misgendered me, I told my friend, and anxiously asked her if I looked like a boy. She said no. She asked me how I felt about him misgendering me, and I replied that I didn\'t really care. I think I was kind of numb at the time; I had never been misgendered the way he misgendered me before, and it was a weird feeling. If I was a cisgender female, why didn\'t I care that I had just been misgendered???\n\nWhen my brother\'s classmate misgendered me, I felt embarrassed. I felt like I was an ugly girl, because some kid couldn\'t tell if I was a guy or girl. I was anxious about being misgendered, and broke down crying when I got home from school. \n\nWhen I was misgendered by someone at school, I didn\'t really care at first. But I started thinking about it after it happened, and I realized that I wasn\'t totally uncomfortable with he/him pronouns; of course, I had been using she/her pronouns all my life, so it was a little weird to have them suddenly being used for me without my consent. I asked my mom to use he/him pronouns for me, and I could feel my heart pounding when I sent that text. She started texting back questions I was uncomfortable answering, so I dropped it and tried to forget about it. \n\nRecently, I started to identify myself as a masculine-leaning bigender person, but that label didn\'t feel quite right at the time. I started identifying myself as genderfluid, but something still felt off. I decided that my gender didn\'t really matter; I\'m a person, that was the answer that I decided I would give to people who asked if I was a boy or girl. I thought I was a trans guy, but then I realized that I still wanted to be a girl sometimes. \n\nI started feeling dysphoria. I mean, I guess I\'ve always felt it. I\'ve always felt a little uncomfortable in tight shirts that showed my chest, and I felt uncomfortable in skirts, dresses, and tight clothes made for girls. But I started feeling and really noticing my dysphoria towards things I had never been dysphoric about before. I couldn\'t listen to female rappers or singers. I couldn\'t wear certain shoes because they were ""girls shoes."" I was uncomfortable seeing my name on Zoom, hearing my teachers say my name, and hearing them refer to me with she/her pronouns.\n\nI\'d also like to mention that I tried packing yesterday with socks. I felt happy seeing a bulge there, since I often felt like something was missing down there.\n\nI found a safe place for me, the Sexuality and Gender Alliance club at my high school. I started going by a name that I decided was unisex, and started using he/him pronouns. Right now, I am happy with where I am. I am a person, and my gender does not really define me, though at times it seems like it does. \n\nIf you read all the way here, thank you. Thank you for giving me an outlet to share my story. Thank you for allowing me to share your story with you. Thank you for hearing me, for listening to me.\n\nTL;DR - I experience gender dysphoria and am still questioning my gender, but I am happy with where I am right now.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Questioning my Gender (LONG RANT)', 'created': 1602729833.0}"

All this time there’s been a rainbow hiding in the grey,
Like an uneasy warmth,
On an otherwise cold day,
Curiosities subdued by a fear of the unknown,
One so great, the fear itself remained unknown,
Being alone is a lonely soul’s only comfort

But change begins with discomfort,
Like beads of sweat, 
Gathering on fingertips,
That are all that’s left clinging to the edge of the bridge,
The bridge between what was and what could be,
Can I let go of what I was, to be who I am?
Is that what forgiveness feels like?

Though the good days are in the past, The best is yet to come,
This might not come to last, The fight may never be done,

Right now I present as a straight guy, but am very transamorous. 

What I am trying to understand is how can I express my attraction to individuals who are transitioning without being seen as a “chaser”? 

To be bluntly clear, I am very attracted to femininity, but am not attracted to one specific area that those who are “afab” have. 

I’m a person who is very seriously considering transitioning myself due to feelings and other things I’ve been dealing with for many years, and I am simply trying to understand how to enter into this type of community. 

Yes, I am attracted to individuals who are transitioning from male to female. 

No, that does not mean I’m fetishizing or chasing them just to hookup or anything of that nature. 

If it helps, one reason I am attracted to individuals who are transitioning is because I freaking admire their bravery! To begin such a journey has to be one of the scariest things anyone has ever done, and to do it successfully? You freaking rock! The courage and strength behind that is amazing! And who can say whether or not you are doing it successfully? Only you can!

If I needed to sign a waiver saying: I wouldn’t try to hookup with an individual who is transitioning if they reached out to talk to me, I would. My intent is to befriend, to support, to learn, and to love. 

Along with everything above, I’ve been wrestling for years with the desire to transition (mtf) myself. Frankly I’m terrified and alone in this. 

I’m willing to read comments, pm’s, and chats. I hope that having feelings of attraction towards those who have transitioned from male-to-female doesn’t automatically assign to me a nasty narrative.

My way of disregarding my dysphoria has been programming, now that the pandemic has hit and I’ve finished my longest project that took months. I’m outta luck, some days I feel so hopeless and sometimes just wanna cry. 
————-:-///———————/—————-—————————
Some days, it feels like a python taking my breath and personality just constricting me till the pressure just tears me up. I’m not out to anyone for a good reason. Some days, I wish I had someone to speak with about this that actually could understand. I used to be out long ago, but I always felt people treated me so harshly and discreetly packaged it as caring. So, I got off my HRT since I was struggling to afford it and ever since my life has been spiraling down into a never ending torture. (Big mistake of my life) I know I need to work on being confident and I do but of course it takes time. 
 I feel so lost but usually meditate since my therapist I used to see before I moved said it will help me. And it does some days except, it catches up and beats me down after a long high of happiness.

The kid looked up and said 'how?'

So the mom looked back and stumbled over the thought of hov to explain trans ppl to a 5 yr old and her best answer, which I loved, was 'some girl and boys don't look like girls or boys' and the kid was happy with that.

2020-10-16 05:01:25,jc3ojy,1,1,"Needing some help or advice with my current mental state.

Prior to middle school, I was comfortable with my biological sex and never really thought about gender in a concrete form. I believe I first I thought I was trans ever since I found social media groups and correlated how I was feeling about my body/self as dysphoria, but I've been going back and forth regarding my identity since. The details of said social media have long since faded outside of them being a very brief stint in my middle school career, but obviously they've been pretty influential. Throughout middle and high school, I flip flopped between identifying as my biological sex and as transgender, with periods of identifying as nonbinary as well. Nothing felt right. Outside of that, I was never very active in the trans community, and during college I had a long stretch of subscribing to very transphobic ideals once I left high school and realized that I didn't like being associated with transgender people. 

Now, I act as my opposite biological sex (cis) online and feel better doing so, albeit I'm constantly paranoid that someone will oust me as trans or the opposite sex. In real life, I let people project what they will onto me and do nothing to clarify anything (I do, however, get incredibly angry when I'm gendered as my biological sex or am ""clocked"" as transgender; this anger is never expressed publicly, though). I make efforts to appear more in line with the opposite gender, but I'm currently doing little things that appear more in line with my biological sex in the name of trying to not label things. I recently tried on old clothes from when I dressed more in line with my biological sex, and while I didn't have a strong reaction outside of ephemeral shock and latent, somewhat minor discomfort, I didn't connect what I saw in the mirror to the person I feel is operating my brain. To be fair, though, I don't think I connect that person to anyone I've seen in the mirror in a long while.

It's probably worth noting that while I haven't suffered from any trauma, body dysmorphia, etc, I've struggled with nearly lifelong depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts/actions that may be influencing my self-perception (I've been experiencing something that aligns with ""dysphoria,"" but I don't want to rush to label things). I never had many friends in the past and still don't have many now, viscerally dislike myself outside of gendered distress (I acknowledge transitioning won't absolve me of this self-loathing, but I wonder if I truly believe this or am only aware of this logically), and still have a long way to go to unlearn very toxic beliefs surrounding gender roles and the LGBT community (reading books on gender theory have helped me in this regard, but they're only making me more overwhelmed when I try applying them to my own life--everything simultaneously relates and is completely foreign to me).

I'm now incredibly depressed and confused regarding every facet of my identity, and I'm tired of all the sleepless nights filled with confusingly-relatable-yet-not-quite-relatable detransition videos and self loathing. I see myself at a fork in the road, but both options feel simultaneously wonderful and horrible at the same time. My past and current therapists haven't been much help, unfortunately, and I'm desperate at this point. I can acknowledge that this subreddit is inherently biased, but I trust and respect everyone's opinion here. Like I said, I'm very desperate and tired.

I know that this topic can be controversial, but I sincerely am wondering and I'm only asking for myself. If you have transitioned/want to transition I fully support you! ❤️

I am just so lost... I am AFAB and I know I have gender dysphoria, but I'm just not sure if I'm trans. I tried out pronouns and a new name for a few months and I liked it. 

Recently, someone asked me if maybe I want to be trans because of internalized homophobia (like, suggesting maybe it would be easier for me to be a ""straight guy"" than be a lesbian), and that really threw me into a tailspin and made me question even more than I already was.

However, I think I still have gender dysphoria. It tears me apart inside everyday. I want to know if there's a way that I can *like* being my assigned gender? I think I could live with it, but there's just things that I can't get over. I want to love being a woman, but it makes me feel weird to claim that for myself. But I really want to be okay with it. 

I'm kind of desperate. If you have any experience or suggestions at all, I welcome all feedback.

  So, I am having very bad dysphoria lately and it has led me to do things like harming myself and smashing my bathroom mirror. One thing I tried is to wear more feminine clothes (I'm mtf btw). I also have been taking showers and going to the bathroom with the lights off. Another thing is my voice, u try not to talk but my job makes me speak a lot so it's hard to avoid. And other problems I don't want to get into. I had many attempts of sudicde, and I think I'm heading back to that (it's been a while I thought things were going to stay better). I debated about posting but I feel like it's better to try than not.      

    Also does not help that I am on the spectrum so conversations with my therapist even is hard. Speaking of that, I have contacted support and they actually surprisingly did help however not for long, I temporary feel ok but then always go back to experiencing hell. I guess what I am asking is idk, just anything to stop me idk. I posted this in a lot of places and got taken down so hopefully it doesn't here but if so so be it but won't help.

As the title suggests, I (married, 26) am really trying to make some friends in this community because frankly I’m terrified of taking the first step toward transitioning. I have female clothes that I wear around the house and I love dressing up, and I’ve started really taking care of myself physically, losing weight, much better personal hygeine, and I’m out to my wife. We’ve opened our relationship as well (mutually because she really isn’t attracted to femininity, and I’m... I really don’t know at this point)

I posted a few days ago on the topic of being transamourus versus being a chaser, and there’s so much that it feels like I’m missing. I am so so sorry if any of the things I say are offensive or come off as me being the creepy guy just attracted to trans women. My heart is breaking inside because I do not know how to express correctly how I feel. 

I grew up in a sheltered home and culture where derogatory words and ideas flowed rather freely. I HATE ALL OF THAT! I have the utmost love and respect to all individuals who are going through transition because I know I understand only a little of what you all go through every day. 

“What am I looking for?” 

Personally, I believe that if you have a goal of doing or being something (or someone) in life, then find someone who is doing that well and follow them. 

I’m looking for people I can talk with, ask honest, open, hard questions to, people I can go to coffee, or maybe even dinner with. Someone to hold hands with through this process. One person or a few people. 

I understand that therapy is an essential part of transitioning, as it would help me understand why I want to transition, or if I’m just viewing it as an escape. I am considering therapy very seriously, and if I do transition, my goal would be to be full-time 100% passable woman. 

You all are amazing! I wish you all the best! and if you would like a texting buddy, send me a DM or a comment and I will do the very best I can.

2020-10-17 18:01:44,jczwq8,0,1,"Hello everyone, 

This is a relatively positive place so I hope this message is apt and accepted. 

I know that finding love as a trans person can be difficult, and dating can be problematic and hard. I am lucky to have met my fiancé relatively early in her transition, and while I fell for her intensely and quickly, I made a conscious effort to make her experience dating me a positive one. I hoped beyond hope that my feelings were reciprocated, and I'm very happy to say that they were, but still I decided very early on that it was important to give her a positive experience. She deserves love and I feel privileged to be the one to give that to her. 

All of you deserve love, and none of you deserve to have bad experiences dating just because you happen to be trans. You deserve better than to be someone's fetish or experiment. At the same time you deserve the sexual liberty to have fun and do as you wish with consenting partners, naturally, but I hope you understand my point all the same. 

Find someone that loves, understands, cherishes, and values you as the individual you are. There are people out there that can give you the love you deserve and I hope you find them. 

As a cisgendered person there are things you need to take into account and consider when dating a trans person. But this is the case in any relationship. We are all individuals and every relationship needs thought and effort put into it. The idea that dating a trans person is a burden is harmful and false. Yes, there may be some difficulties at times, but like I say that is the case in any relationship. Don't feel guilty for 'burdening' someone, because if they truly love you, I promise, any difficulties you face will not be a burden for them. 

There is more I could say but I think it may dilute my overall message if I say more.",trans,Just a message,1602982904.0,"{'created_utc': 1602957704, 'id': 'jczwq8', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hello everyone, \n\nThis is a relatively positive place so I hope this message is apt and accepted. \n\nI know that finding love as a trans person can be difficult, and dating can be problematic and hard.

But this is the case in any relationship. We are all individuals and every relationship needs thought and effort put into it. The idea that dating a trans person is a burden is harmful and false. Yes, there may be some difficulties at times, but like I say that is the case in any relationship. Don't feel guilty for 'burdening' someone, because if they truly love you, I promise, any difficulties you face will not be a burden for them. \n\nThere is more I could say but I think it may dilute my overall message if I say more."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Just a message', 'created': 1602982904.0}"

2020-10-17 21:42:58,jd3t3x,2,1,"My boyfriend (19M) of two years has recently told me (20M) they want to transition from MtF and what my thoughts were. I have been completely supportive to my ability on the situation and told them regardless whatever route they take, I will support them and we will make it work. 

When I ask my partner how long they have felt like this, they said that it’s been a long time, even before we got together, but they’ve suppressed it to the back of their mind until now. I obviously want to support them so looked into the route of how to achieve it in the UK, the financial side so I can support where possible, and even during the build up to telling their mum, which they were a nervous wreck about.

Nonetheless, they did this and felt much Better for doing this. They’ve so far only told me, our bosses, their mum, and their sister, but not their farther or two brothers just yet and they were talking about wanting to start hormones soon without an unnecessary wait time. 

They have told me tonight that sometimes, they wake up and think of transitioning and what it’ll be like, but then sometimes they think about how they will miss being a man. I feel like this may be normal as they have known no difference in life, but I don’t want to be to vocal and come across pushing for a transition because I just want to support them and make them happy, however they decide to lead their lives. 

I want to know if anyone who has transitioned, post or pre op has ever had these doubts when looking into this or during the process and if you would consider this a natural response or whether the doubt means transitioning may not be what my partner needs. I just want to be a good support network for my boyfriend as we’ve already discussed names and how they would love to look I.e wigs, dress sense etc. 

I have told them to hold off speaking to their doctor for the time being as I don’t want them to go in with doubt and their doctor decide for them that transitioning isn’t correct and dismiss it if that’s what they decide they want to do in the future, I just want to be able to understand this more and see how my partner is feeling and how to react etc.

I feel a strong social dysphoria and I would love to be a girl but I don't hate my body. I just hate that  it doesn't look feminine and that my hair grows back so rapidly and I have to shave everyday. I would love to have a woman body, but I don't hate with a passion mine. 
I get the good chemicals like crazy when I look at my FaceApp photos, when I look at photos of transition, when I do make up and when I dress feminine. I'm pretty disconnected with my emotions so I don't feel much else and these things are some of the very few things that put a genuine smile on my face. 

I feel like a woman, I want to be a woman, I would press the button and I would like to take estrogen. Still I can't be sure I'm trans. I think people like Kelvin are necessarily because everywhere there are only positive voices and it is healthy to doubt yourself and the choices you are going to make.

Obviously everybody experience gender differently and Kalvin can't be sure about what he assumes and he's unnecessarily aggressive so I'm not a fan but still I think he's a voice that needs to be heard. 

What do you think about youtubers like him, Ryan, or London? 
On a side note, how do you feel your dysphoria, if you have it and what do you think about not-dysphoric trans people? 

Disclaimer: I don't identifying in any way as a transmed. I'm just doubting myself. Personally I think that everybody should pursue happiness and self-realization in any way that doesn't harm others.

2020-10-18 09:35:15,jddgs4,3,1,"So first of all hi, please forgive the formatting I’m on mobile and I hope this post is ok here. 

I’ve (25) identified as nonbinary (afab) for four years, since I started to question my gender identity. It became very clear to me that I wasn’t a woman and that some of the mental health issues I’d been having were linked to dysphoria. 
I settled on agender as I felt it was the best representation of what I was feeling, not really identifying with any genders. 

Here’s where my problem is. I never actually considered that I might be ftm. I was raised by a prejudiced family (who to be fair have been great since I came out as bi, but I think trans would be too much for them so I’m not out to them) and whenever I would do something butch or masculine growing up, such as ask to cut my hair short, my mom would say “You know you’re not a boy, right?” 
Also I was in a relationship with a cishet man at the time who said he was supportive of my struggles, but that he would leave me if after my questioning phase I came to the conclusion that I was a transman. 

I just worry now that I’m comfortably out in my social group that I’ll never be truly happy with my identity because I might’ve pushed away any thoughts that could’ve meant I identified differently. 

I fluctuate in my presentation, as my dysphoria fluctuates, it’s mainly top and monthly cycle that sets me off. But some days I’m perfectly fine wearing lingerie or a dress. 

I’m just looking for advice I guess? Anyone ever been in a similar situation?

This game was made to influence the pubblic opinion to be tollerant toward people that see the world defferently to prevent unfortunate consequences like happened in this game. I suggest you to check out the game. But if you didn't want to buy and play it you can still watch some gameplays I realized to share the story of this intresting adventure game. Despite I'm not a trans I support the idea that people have to be tollerant toward this community.

I’m 25 and I don’t live with my mom and she’s 18 and alternates between moms and dads and I told our mom like 2 weeks ago at a restaurant over lunch and she was very supportive she gave me a hug and said she will always love me. It went well imo. The next week she became ridiculously paranoid and started freaking out about the logistics with me when I would come over for dinner. Telling me “it affects every part of your life (duh). And it’s very very expensive and your family is going to have a hard time with it blah blah blah” but i managed to calm her down and she became normal-ish. Even going as far to look up books written by transgender women so she could have more insight, which gave me hope that things would be okay. 

Last night my sister who still very much presents masc was caught shaving her legs, well she was caught like after she did it my mom saw hair in the razor. Mom flipped out started going on tangents about how problematic it would be for her like with the money and family things. My mom said “why me why me” and when my sister tried to end the conversation my mom threw a glass plate full of food across the room. My sister ended up coming over my house after that and my mom called me saying “you me your brother(sister) and your father need to have a sit down conversation, I can’t wait for you to tell them on your own terms” and I started yelling at her that this had nothing to do with her. I said a lot of things and told her “we want you to participate in our lives, but if you’re going to be this way then we will have to adapt.” 

My sister slept over and we talked about life and things and everything was okay after that whole ordeal. It was nice, but I’m very frustrated with this whole situation and I guess I’m mostly just venting here. Does anyone else have a trans sibling where they themselves are trans too ?

I'm so not use to being the one to ask?! 😅 I'm scared she'll say no and then it will remain weird between us. How do I drop hints that I like her? I believe she has dropped little hints, especially when I mentioned our small age difference and she got defensive saying it's hardly anything.

2020-10-21 06:01:24,jf7c8o,13,1,I have seen people reprimanded on here for stating that they were specifically wanting to date a trans woman. One reason was that the woman was not being dated because she was a woman but because she was being treated as a fetish. I look at it a little differently. To me a woman that would come out to me as a trans woman literally gave me a part of her soul. I have read many accounts of people coming out that said it was the hardest thing they have ever done. I am not saying that trans would be my only criteria for dating and exclude non trans people. What I am saying is I am attracted to a trans person because they gave me a part of their heart not knowing if they would be rejected or accepted. If they could be crushed. The fact that a person would entrust me with their soul. I guess it would still be selfish to seek that out but can you tell me the likelyhood of randomly finding that kind of person without specifically looking for it? Another reason I would want to date a trans person is they are not looking to find themselves at least they are well on the way. I think that they have been strengthened by their experiences.

2020-10-22 03:57:16,jfsh76,3,1,"A few months ago, after being quarantined in a new apartment by myself for online school for a couple months, I (AFAB) was casually thinking about my gender when the common thought crossed my mind: “if life was like a video game and I could customize my gender with the push of a button, I’d probably choose to have a male body.” And then it hit me: that can’t be normal. Not for cis people, at least. That day was the start of a continuing spiral that has caused me to constantly question and think about my gender, to the point where it’s almost always in the back of my mind if I’m not actively pondering it.

I want to talk about it so badly, but I don’t know how to bring it up or even what to say. Talking about my feelings is how I experience them and work through them. I keep no secrets from my family. But now I feel like this is something I should keep to myself. Idk why; my sister and my cousin (who lives with my direct family) are extremely progressive, and both my parents are a bit behind the times and judgmental but still accepting and not particularly transphobic. I want to tell them what I’m feeling, but for once my brain is telling me to save it for therapy.

A couple days ago I think I finally might’ve had a breakthrough on my process towards figuring out exactly what I am. I’m still not sure, but this seems like the closest I’ve been so far. I was laying in bed, thinking about my gender like I’ve been doing a lot lately, and the thought crossed my mind, “I’m just both.” And then it hit me — I might be both.

So gender-wise, I think I’m both a man and a woman. Like both at the same time (and maybe with a little bit of a third gender mixed in that I can’t quite identify). I feel like I’m leaning feminine, but not particularly strongly either way. But I do think I experience both binaries at least a little bit. I did some research and I think this is called bigender.

Sexually, however, I also feel like I’m both, but (at least right now) I genuinely feel like I’m more male than female. The thing is, because I’m not extremely uncomfortable with my female body, there’s really nothing I can do about it.

This seems to be the closest thing to the truth that I’ve felt. I don’t see any problems with this conclusion. I’m really starting to feel like this might be me. But at the same time, I’m still a bit disappointed, because I probably won’t ever be able to fully embrace my masculine sexuality. I don’t hate my feminine body or desire a masculine body enough to put myself through a sex change. Because my GENDER is leaning feminine, there’s not much I can do about that or my sex. And even if I did want one, I highly doubt that any doctors would be willing to do it, anyway. It sucks, but I just don’t see a solution. I think I’m just gonna have to live with it.

It would explain a lot, why I’m suddenly having this but at the same time for my whole life I was okay with being female. It’s cause I AM female, but now I feel like something else is missing. But idk if it’s a big enough problem to really exert a lot of effort towards.

I don’t like WISH I had dysphoria. Nobody does. But part of me is just a little disappointed that I don’t. I know that’s horrible, and doesn’t make sense. Like how privileged could I possibly be to be even a little disappointed about that. I already have depression, and that’s bad enough as is. I’m already faced with horrible, self-degrading intrusive thoughts on a daily basis, especially when I’m home alone, and the feelings that go with that feel horrible. I’ve heard so many experiences from people with dysphoria and it sounds terrible. I know that it is. I can see how painful it is.

So don’t get me wrong, I don’t wish I had it. But if I did, then I could at least know for sure that I was a man (at least physically). Then I could really know what I was, and have a reason to transition, a stronger desire. Does that, by itself, mean I’m trans? Lately, I have been kind of wanting to. I imagine myself as an enby with a twinkish male body and feel sad that I could never be that way. Honestly, I just want someone to tell me that I can transition, and then knowing I had the option, I could decide from there if that’s what I really wanted. If I could press a button and change immediately, I would. But having to deal with the whole process, with the imperfect body I’ll have as a result, with transphobia, with all the self-doubt and regrets I could (and almost definitely would) end up with… it’s terrifying to think about. Plus I’ve gotten used to being a straight female in the dating scene. But despite all that, part of me wishes I was trans, that I could be what I like to imagine myself as. But I might never know if that’s me.

*sigh*

Thanks for listening to my vent. If anybody has any advice, I’d really appreciate it.

•TL;DR•: I think I might be bigender, but my gender leaning feminine and my sex leaning masculine. I don’t have dysphoria though, so even if I wanted a sex change, I don’t think I could get it / would be stopped in place by my self-doubts. So it sucks that, because I’m both male and female (or at least that’s what I think right now — I’m still not sure), and my gender is more femme than masc, I can probably never know what it’s like to have the body I desire.

2020-10-22 15:40:13,jg1z3a,2,1,"Hey everyone! I've been happily dating my trans (and nonbinary) partner for a couple of months now. They're really a wonderful person and I'm grateful that I can know them and date them. Their trans identity is only one of many many things that draws me to them as a person.

We've talked some about their identity (hormones, a little about how they realized they're trans, being nonbinary and trans, etc.) and their trans friends and the community. I'm grateful that they're open about all of this with me. **But they're the first trans person I've ever dated and one of the first gay relationships I've ever had, so all of this is new (and exciting, ofc!) to me and I don't really know how to navigate if I'm being honest.** ***To put it shortly, I don't know the ""best practices.""***

(I fully realize they don't need their cis girlfriend to ""protect"" them. I don't at all want to be the savior-complex-ey, white, cis ""woke"" girlfriend who condescendingly treats their partner like a sad puppy who needs saving. I am nervous about being that person and being intrusive or ""woke""-ly condescending or insensitive, even if I don't mean to be. I'm posting this and asking myself and y'all these questions because I want to know how I can be a good partner.)

&amp;#x200B;

* **How do you wish your cis partners had behaved with respect to your trans identity? What things have cis partners of yours done (or stopped doing, even) that made your relationship better?**
* **Do you have any videos/podcasts/articles/anything (literally anything) that you would recommend cis partners of trans people look at?** I want to understand trans people and experiences (the good and the bad) without putting weight on my partner to be my educator or my dictionary, but I don't know where to start.
* **How can I ask about their pronouns?** When I met them they introduced themselves with ""they/them,"" but they recently started using not only ""they"" pronouns but ""she"" pronouns with certain people. We haven't talked about it, they just updated their social media bio with the ""they/she."" **I'm curious about whether they would like for me to call them ""she"" or ""my girlfriend"" or anything else ""she""-oriented, but should I wait for them to initiate that conversation? Does it make me a bad partner that sometimes in my mind I think of them as my girlfriend?**
* **Is it weird if I ask them if we could do each other's makeup or paint each other's nails?** We both like makeup and all that good stuff, I just don't want it to be like I'm trying too hard.
* **Is it weird if I compliment their appearance with traditionally female-oriented words/phrases? Should I use more neutral phrases?** Like rather than saying, ""You look really nice today!"" I tend to say, ""Wow, your hair is so pretty"" or ""You have really gorgeous eyes"". I don't do this in any conscious effort, just I look at them and see someone who is pretty, gorgeous, beautiful, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some pertinent background:**

We're both in our early 20's and in college, for some context.

Last night my partner and I were relaxing in their room and they said they needed to shave their legs. I'm stupid and sarcastically responded, ""You know *real humans* (\*air quotes\*) are always hairless, right?"". I was being satirical with that comment and I say satirical comments with them quite often about many different topics (and they share that sense of humor), but really genuinely I wish I hadn't said that last night. They didn't seem to even really notice what I said but I'm still going to apologize nonetheless. After reflecting on it a bit, I just kind of see that what I said, even as a ""joke,"" wasn't really up to my own personal standards of communication and respect and I want them to know that. I say stupid and insensitive things like this to people sometimes and I wanna stop doing it. **I don't want them to feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them with this apology or with how I talk to them --- I just wanna be a more sensitive communicator in general.**

**In a similar sense with the eggshells, the last time we were having sex they told me something along the lines of ""you don't have to worry about hurting me""** (no, not in a kinky way lol....). I reassured them that I'm not worried about it.  I *definitely* don't think of them as being fragile or feeble or broken or the like in any way, including sex, and I don't want them to worry otherwise. We avoid certain activities that make them dysphoric and I'm totally fine with that, its no big deal, there's some things we also don't do because I'm just not into it. So, in that way, we're both comfortable stating when we aren't into something. We also have little check-ins during our intimate moments to make sure the other person is doing well. **I just don't want to do something in bed that would make them dysphoric and don't really know how to navigate that.

So I was out with my daughter at Ulta, and the greeter at the front was clearly born male, but was pretty obviously dressed to present female. They asked me if I needed any help, which I did, so I asked about the location of a few items. Throughout the interaction I referenced them with she/her pronouns. All seemed to go well. 

Then, in the car on the way home, I was mentioned to my daughter how I was glad that the greeter worked there and dressed and presented how they wanted to. It’s not super common around us, so I was just kinda happy about it. Like the world is changing in a good way. 

But, my daughter felt she had to point out that I didn’t really “know” the greeter wanted to be referred to by she/her, just because they wore a skirt and feminine make up. So, maybe I shouldn’t do that in the future. 

That said, do you think it’s a good rule of thumb to use physical cues to help guide me with pronouns during interactions with staff at a store when it seems that staff are trying to present a certain way?

2020-10-23 05:46:25,jgh79u,4,1,"Do I have internalized transphobia or am I just a tomboy/have internalized misogyny

I have been thinking about it since the start of October.

I have been feminine since I was born. Loved things like dresses and makeup since I can remember. But I do main male characters in smash bros and over watch and one of my highest comfort characters is a guy too.

My favorite youtubers are all males same goes for most of my favorite anime characters and music artists. 

I do feel pretty insecure about my voice and how I think it sounds too deep. Same with my broad shoulders. I also dislike my dip hips and started crying one time during boxing practice.

I remember when I watched Hamilton one time and I remember crying when Angelica appeared on the screen and felt so jealous over her body. 

I also dislike my short hair. My dad felt too lazy to fix the lice problem me and my brother had when we were both toddlers so he cut our hair. And I have tried to grow it back and make it bigger. I also want box braids.

I really like makeup but it really sets off my eczema.

So yeah, after reading those paragraphs. You might wonder why I decided to post this.

But basically. To start the entire thing. It was an average Wednesday and I was in the school library watching tiktoks. Then I just started to question myself. Like, what if I was trans the entire time. I have always felt like a girl. But now, I was just confused. So I texted my mom if we could buy some dresses. 

Later, we did. And it was pretty fun.

Then this week and the weekends prior. I continued questioning. I like being a girl and I feel comfort in my body, but I wouldn’t mind being a guy. 

And I just feel detached from my femininity. I don’t feel as feminine compared to the other girls in my school, but I don’t feel as masculine as the guys at my school. But I don’t feel like I’m non binary. 

I have done a few tests online which all say that I’m not or that I’m too young. 

But I’m questioning if I’m just doing feminine things because I’m compensating and/or has internalized transphobia.

The reason i am doing this project is due to the fact that many people in india think that being a transgender person is like being a “demon”. Transgender people, where i live are treated like beggars and outcasts, people ignore them and pretend that they do not exist.

This is what I got so far;

1.)What are ALL of the changes I will experience?

2.)How do I deal with acne?

3.)Do I have to have a specific diet or workout routine??

4.)What are the basic things I should know?

5.)How long do you take testosterone?

4.)What should I expect each month as i keep taking testosterone?

5.)What are the risks? Is there anything I should be worried about? 

6.) I read that you can go bald, I don't know if this is true but how can you prevent this?

2020-10-24 04:49:38,jh30vm,4,1,"TW: These questions might trigger gender dysphoria for some, I guess(?).

Hi!

I'm doing a little SOGIE talk for a group of fellow students where I'll be giving them the basic foundation for understanding SOGIE and contemporary gender issues. I've asked them to send me burning questions regarding gender beforehand so that I could address them in the talk.

I feel like I'm able to answer most of them except for 1 specific set of questions regarding dating trans people and the etiquette to it. I'm agender, polysexual, and express myself androgynously (I hope?), so I think that it would be better off for trans people whose expressions are more aligned with their identity to answer these.

1. Is having a preference for non-trans individuals over trans individuals transphobic? For example, someone refuses to date trans women and only dates cis women. Is that type of behavior transphobic? &lt;---- I'm thinking this question refers specifically to genital revulsion, and my guess is that the preference is rooted in transphobia but *not exactly* transphobic.
2. Is it transphobic for a person to ask what someone's genitals are on a date or before a hookup? Further, is it transphobic for a person to forego romantic or sexual advances upon learning what their target's genitals are?
3. How do I ask someone their pronouns especially if I'm not close with them or don't know them personally?

Questions 1 and 2 are the more difficult questions that I simply can't answer on my own, so I'd appreciate if your responses focused on that. Both run on the premise that the asker is unaware whether the person they're dating/about to hook up with is trans or not.

https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/8TLQHPSAP9V7?ref_=wl_share


But as much as i would love for me to get gifts and such, this post really isn't about that, its main focus is about the 3 year journey I've been on and dealing with coming in and out of the closet and never truly accepting who i am or having that support structure. I have my fiance and a few friends, but the list stops there, our families aren't too supportive at all and it became very difficult to really express myself without the fear of being judged, and when my fiance started questioning themselves, my attention went fully to making sure they're happy with who they become. Around this time is where i sat down with my family and laid it all out, one world pandemic later and my mom is still apologizing for dead names and the wrong gender, so no progress has been made really.

In spite of all that, my fiance finally found their identity and posted all over the various lgbt places on here and got so much support it really boosted our confidence, some of you may have even seen their posts, couple that with them getting their first binders, and then my job accepting me, our confidence has never been higher and we really have come a long way and we're embracing our journey with open arms and warm hearts.

So to all those that arent out yet, and those that are struggling, dont give up, I've been questioning since i was 16, came out at 22, and embraced the transition at 25. It takes time, some of you will take longer than others to really come to terms with who you are, but when you do, it'll be a very beautiful moment.

2020-10-24 19:42:34,jhf9n4,6,1,"Hello everyone,

Thank you in advance for any caring advise.

I've been gone from my job for several months. When I returned recently, I learned that one of my coworkers came out as transgender since I left. It feels weird to just go along like nothing is different, but I don't want to make a big deal out of it either. Is there something I could say to acknowledge I accept and celebrate her change? (yes, her)

2020-10-24 20:48:13,jhgf5q,2,1,"Hello everyone, I am a voice actor and I came to share a story, which to me has great value.

About five years ago I started voice acting. I could do a, bunch of good voices after a year or so and finally got a job. 
Two years ago I got an audition which had an amazing job, like dream one, and good pay. Twist was I had to learn a female voice along my usual ones, within a year. 
I could not for the love of me get how to do it and Internet wasn't that helpful. I asked around for help, a ton of it. Until I found the trans community

I was really scared to go ask for help. Waited almost too long before I said fuck it and just went in and explained myself and asked for help.

I was shocked by the amazing response. So many people volunteered to help me personally. It was beautiful to see people act out of kindness, and to someone outside the community, someone who had no right to be in the community. But still helped me.

I was afraid of insulting or offending someone with my reguest. As I had a negative imagine of transpeople. All I've seen of them was from non trans person ranting about their rights and in my oblivious mind I thought they were the same. So many of those people are so eager to be offended and not let someone explain.
Someone like me who has trouble with social interactions. I am blunt and brutally honest. I tell what's on my mind how it is. How I see it and how I think it. I lack a filter, but never do I want to cause harm

The chasm between me and you was wide and grew wider as I listened to social media. But as I came to you for help. It vanished. You were just normal nice humans. Not annoying, mean, provocative, anything like what the people that had been visible were.

I am sorry for having negative thoughts, in my defence, the people who speak for you are not well suited for it. They seem mean and unwelcoming.

Now I've kinds been a part of the community, just as someone who wants to learn how to do a female voice, but I feel like I am a part of it. People are so open and welcoming

I don't know how to help you narrow the gap, but I will talk of you as an average Joe. More so than before

So, I get really triggered by Lizzo.  I'll explain more, but one of the main things is that she has some negative things to say about men, and I still present as a man IRL, but I don't want to, so then I want to identify with the female point of view she's speaking from but I feel like I don't have a right to, because I didn't grow up being judged as a woman.

This is complicated by the fact that last year my wife and I got into a big argument about music that originated by talking about Lizzo, which stemmed partly from the fact that she perceived me coming from a male point of view and me just totally not feeling that way but afraid (still afraid today) to say anything to the contrary.  The result of the argument was that she yelled at me for always playing my music when we were home together, which caused me so much self hatred that I couldn't use the record player, even when I was alone, for months. Even today it's had lasting effects in that even though music is my life, I often don't put it on in many situations where I previously did.

I feel like this sounds ridiculous, and like it shouldn't possibly affect my life, but it actually does fairly often.

I've been thinking that i might be trans. But i'm not sure.
I realised i did a lot of things in my childhood that would show that i wanted to be another gender, i dressed up like the other gender, i put myself in the character of the other gender, ...
But idk if i ever hated my gender to say it like that.
I really wanna be the other gender and think life would be a lot easier as the opposite gender (minus all the transphobia).
But i never really hated my gender.
I hate a lot about myself and i do feel like it's not me in the mirror.
I started looking around at trans stuff, but i feel like everyone knew they hated there gender and stuff.
I had a small idea that i just forced myself to see me as one gender.

Is there anyone who could give me some advice how to actually know? Or people who had the same thing.

I'm feeling lost and confused and I really just wish I had some sort of answer or at least something close to an answer. I have a list of reasons why I think I might be a boy and reasons why I think maybe i'm not. If anybody has any input/advice I would appreciate it. 

REASONS WHY I THINK I AM TRANS:
-I never truly saw/recognized myself as a girl
-when I was younger I had a theory that my parents had switched my gender at birth (i'm aware it doesn't make sense, I was very young when I thought this) and I was actually a girl who transitioned to boy and that's why I look like a boy
-I would always get really excited when I got to play a boy in a school play 
-I would always copy what everyone else was doing so it took me a while to stop trying to be other people and just be myself. That could be why I dressed feminine for so long
-I made jokes about being upset about being flat chested but I think in reality I really liked it
-When someone calls me he or they on the internet or says I pass it makes my day, or even my week. It makes me happy and I feel good 
-I don't like my female body rn/I want a binder and a haircut 
-As a kid I would always wear male/gender neutral halloween costumes
-I loved playing basketball as a kid because the jerseys/outfits were masculine 
-I currently hate getting feminine compliments
-whenever there is a male part in a song duet I will always choose that over the female one 

REASONS I THINK MAYBE IM NOT TRANS:
-I used to be very confident in my female body. I would be excited to dress feminine and confident whenever I showed off my female body. I would wear tight fitting clothes and I felt very confident in them
-She/her pronouns don't make me uncomfortable at the moment 
-Feminine comments never used to bother me
-i'm 17, which is pretty old to be questioning your gender
-I proudly and confidently identified as a lesbian for quite a while
-i've never really thought about being trans before

2020-10-26 14:48:33,jifvkn,2,1,"Hi Reddit, 

I’m a 17 year old guy who happens to be trans and I’m applying to college this year. 

I’ve been stressing a lot about how being trans may affect that application process. I’m in my senior year now, and out to essentially everyone except some of my family (particularly my parents) and my high school administration. The idea of filling out applications potentially closeted makes me sick, but I’m concerned that divulging that information on the application will either change how admissions looks at me or will force me to come out in order to be acknowledged. I do, however, have the full intention of being completely out in college. 

There’s virtually no information online about applying to college as a trans person, and I don’t really have support in my application process. I’m looking for any information I can get from other trans people who have been through the application process out or not, and what it looked/looks like in college for you now. 

How has it been for you? How did you approach applying to college while trans and how does dorming and classes work once you’re there? How did the way you applied (i.e. out or not out) affect your college experience? Is it important to look for a “trans-friendly” college and what resources does a school like that provide? Any tips? Advice? Relevant stories to tell?

So it's only in the past month that I realized I was trans. While I had been in denial for oh, so many years, I don't at all feel conflicted with this realization. It's been a weight lifted off my shoulders. (There is still plenty of other weight, as I'm not out to anyone other then a couple close friends)

My dysphoria is mild/medium, but pretty constant. There haven't been any nights crying. Just resentment towards whatever God/god(s)/cosmos that's in charge. 

And while I fancy seeing myself as who I really am, I haven't fully decided if transition is what I want. (Yet)

I've asked myself some tough questions, and I realize there are probably many more I haven't even thought of yet. 

I guess in a way I'm trying to be pragmatic. 

The thing that sits in the back of my brain the most is looking in the mirror and finally recognizing my face. I've been pouring over a dozen or so trans related subs, seeing all of these transitions and it's amazing to see how beautiful and handsome you all are. 

I also see a ton of posts of goals. What is hoped to look like. And I admit, Faceapp had me chasing a dream for a few days. I've gone through thousands of photos dreaming about myself. And it felt so good. 

The problem I guess, is I realized I didn't want to fill my head with all of these expectations that likely are very unrealistic. It isn't that I am afraid I won't pass, or at least I don't think it is. But if I do decide to transition, I don't want to have to deal with disappointment. I have put myself through so much physically and emotionally that I don't see the point of building up this dream version of myself.

My (25f) sister (15f) just came out as trans (FYI she said does not want to be referred to as a boy yet, so that’s why I’m using she) and...I’m not sure how I feel about it. Before you write me off, please know I am not opposed at all. I support all healthy genders, identities, and sexualities and have a very “that not my business” view on them. Like seriously, who you love is not my or anyone else’s business lol. I don’t know why some people don’t understand that. But I digress...    

I guess I’m just having a hard time accepting it. She’s only 15 and has had a lot of issues the past few years with belonging and fitting in. She came out as pansexual last year and very shortly after she realized we (my parents and I. I do not live at home btw) were just fine with it, she then said she was actually gay. Still no issue. Then it was back to pansexual, then just depressed, then bipolar, then nothing, and now trans. We want to support her without making her feel like she *needs* to make this decision now. She’s young.    

I’d just like some advice on how to approach this. She’s absolutely crazy about this boy at school, but they clearly have a male-female relationship. Since COVID though (they haven’t seen each other since no school) she’s been dressing more masculine. And then last night she shaved her head and said that she’s “working towards being a boy but don’t call me a boy yet”. Again, my parents didn’t make a big deal just told her it looks nice, and I can now tell she’s regretting it. It’s just a lot for me and I’d like to know how best to support her without putting pressure on her to “double down” if this isn’t truly what she wants. She 100% has the “shock value” gene where she says/does things to get a reaction and I’m afraid this is another one of those things.

I do not live at home btw) were just fine with it, she then said she was actually gay. Still no issue. Then it was back to pansexual, then just depressed, then bipolar, then nothing, and now trans. We want to support her without making her feel like she *needs* to make this decision now. She’s young.    \n\nI’d just like some advice on how to approach this. She’s absolutely crazy about this boy at school, but they clearly have a male-female relationship. Since COVID though (they haven’t seen each other since no school) she’s been dressing more masculine. And then last night she shaved her head and said that she’s “working towards being a boy but don’t call me a boy yet”. Again, my parents didn’t make a big deal just told her it looks nice, and I can now tell she’s regretting it. It’s just a lot for me and I’d like to know how best to support her without putting pressure on her to “double down” if this isn’t truly what she wants. She 100% has the “shock value” gene where she says/does things to get a reaction and I’m afraid this is another one of those things.      \n\nPlease help...', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Help from a different perspective?', 'created': 1603772163.0}"

2020-10-26 22:28:17,jiovjm,8,1,"Hey everyone,

I'm 24 years (amab) and ever since I was a kid, I had a wish of living my life as a girl. I have basically repressed this wish throughout my childhood/adolescence, but it would sometimes surface, in private, where I would wear traditionally women's clothing, makeup and shoes. Assuming a women's role even began dominating my sexual fantasies, despite that I am primarily attracted to women. As time went on, I felt more of a desire to incorporate feminity into my everyday life.

I am currently in a long-term relationship with a woman I love and she is accepting of me openly wearing makeup, feminine shoes and blurring the gender line in terms of my clothing choices - all to a certain point (it can turn her off if I take things too far - which is understandable). For a while, the ability to openly express some feminity kept my feelings of discontent at bay, but recently, they have resurfaced. 

I have entertained the idea of transitioning, but I'm unsure of myself. I don't know if I am truly trans, as I imagined a true trans person would have less doubt than me regarding their gender identity. 

Also, I haven't told my girlfriend that I've felt discontent with my gender identity and that I've thought about transitioning. I'm terrified of her reaction. These thoughts may pass, and in that case, I'd rather not freak her out beforehand.

I guess I'm just curious to find out if my feelings and experience are consistent with a MtF trans person. I appreciate any input. &lt;3",trans,Am I trans?

2020-10-27 00:49:27,jirb2e,2,1,"So I am a twenty year old amab, and about a year ago I moved out from home to study abroad and started exploring various aspects of my own identity due to my newfound freedom. I began questioning my own gender and eventually started identifying as gender fluid without telling anyone but two close friends. These past couple of weeks I've started telling more people in my friends group and feeling overjoyed due to the amount of support and acceptance I received from everyone of them. 

However, I feel that I am using the gender fluid label for now just because it is an umbrella term I feel comfortable with and not because it is the gender identity I feel one hundred percent sure with. I have considered that I might be transfem and have decided to explore that possibility by having close friends refer to me with femenine pronouns and by buying femenine clothes that I've been wearing privately in my room. I feel good when my friends use femenine pronouns to me, but still I prefer neutral ones like they/them; the thing that I wasn't expecting is just how good I would feel using femenine clothes. I bought some tights, a padded bra, and a skirt and have been using them pretty much all the time when I'm in my room, the sensation of having them on and picturing I was a girl is incredible and I hate it when I have to change into my regular clothes to go out into the real world. 

I've already told my mum that I have been having doubts about my gender identity and she was as supportive as one can be, just making sure that I knew she just wants me to feel comfortable in my own skin, but I didn't tell her about the fact that I'm thinking I may want to transition. This is partly due to the fact I'm terrified of transitioning and wonder how will my body react to HRT (I am very slim and already have been told by many I'm effeminate, so I have some things that reassure me)  and of course the old question of ""will I pass?""

I previously made a post that trans people can be considered transformers. Well, I am not the only one who thinks this. President Vladimir Putin stated at the G20 that he believes that trans people are the human first transformers in our history. “They’ve thought up six or five genders – transformers, trans… I don’t even understand what it is myself.” (mygnews, 2019). Now I’d you look beyond the black and white statement and look deeper into the nuance of what he is saying, he is saying that they are transformers because they are biologically achieving something that humans could not achieve before. It is really incredible, and thus the trans community deserves a positive recognition to be referred to as transformers.

So for come context. Im a trans man. I’m in the USA. I got top surgery with Dr. Loren Schecter in Chicago on September 22nd this year. I’m on my dad’s insurance he has through work. It’s Blue Cross Blue Shield for everything but mental health, which is through a company called Beacon Hill. Basically, any kind of therapy and things like that go through Beacon Hill, not BCBS. Beacon Hill is absolute trash and almost no one accepts it bc they pay so little.

So, originally my quote was about $2000 after insurance coverage. I got this quote from BCBS a few weeks before my actual surgery. They weren’t going to cover the liposuction bit, since it wasn’t “essential” or whatever, but okay, $2000 is fine.

Fast forward to today. I get a “explanation of costs” bill in the mail explaining that BCBS has passed all costs onto Beacon Hill. Those costs ARE $108,000!!! Wtf?? Has anyone top surgery, even without insurance, cost $108,000??? 

Basically, Beacon Hill has to approve or deny this cost. If they deny it I owe $108,000. I’m a poor 20 y/o college student and that is fucking insane. My parents and I have a complicated relationship, even if they offered to help pay it, that’s more than what they make in a year, so there’s no way they could really help.

2020-10-27 15:48:57,jj3n7b,5,1,"Hi, I managed to slip up and outed my trans friend to my flatmate while taking about Pride. I would like to know what to do to make sure I do the least possible damage to my trans friend. He and my flatmate know each other but they have never met up in real life.

What happened:
I was chatting with my flatmate about Pride that happened last year and how me and bunch of people, along with my trans friend (let's call him Michael) enjoyed it. My flatmate wants to attend next year so I was talking about stuff that happens there excitedly, which along with me feeling comfortable and safe around her resulted in mentioned fuck up. While talking about  these small discussion LGBTQ+ groups that are there each year, I mentioned that my group of friends back then realized we couldn't actually join them because would have to split up and go individually to join our groups.
And I was just mindlessly adding examples, so I listed that I would have gone to the bi one, my other friend to the asexual one and Michael to the trans one. 

The moment I said that part with Michael I just felt my heart drop but carried on with the story, hoping my flatmate wouldn't notice. I fear that wasn't the case if I can take her expression as a sign. I didn't mention it after that, didn't adress it, finished the conversation and left. I am pretty sure she realized what I said and the meaning of it.

Michael &amp; my flatmate:
Now, my flatmate and Michael only know each other through group video calls since it's a pandemic going on (they have never met in real life). Cameras in calls were always off. They do vibe tho and my flatmate is pretty much becoming part of the friend group where  everyone knows about Michael (that is by no means meant to be an excuse for what I did, I'm saying it just to show the whole picture).
 My flatmate has only seen Michael in photos and has commented that he looks feminine a few times which I always brushed off saying stuff like 'he sometimes looks like that in pictures' or 'yeah and it pisses him off' to make sure she doesn't mention it in front of him. She never meant any harm but I'm pretty sure she thought he was trans for some time now, even though she never mentioned it and always talked about him just like she would about any other guy. She is very open-minded and part of the LGBTQ+ community herself.

Question:
Now, what should I do? I am asking here because I want to make as little damage as possible to Michael, even though I realize most is already done because I fucked up.I want to do what is right.

Should I have a talk about it with my flatmate? If so, what should I tell her (don't mention it/??)? Or should I never mention it again? Should I tell Michael that it happened and if so, how (apart for apologizing, obviously)?

So I came out to my mom in March as ftm, and she told my dad even though I didn’t want her to. My mom is saying that I’m too young to make the decision to transition (being only 13, almost 14), and I kind of understand where she’s coming from, but I just don’t get it. My mother is a Christian and my dad isn‘t, but they share the same view of thinking I’m too young. I’ve had a feeling that I wasn’t cis since 5th grade, but I never acted on it until this year. So, my mom, part of her reasoning to not let me transition was because of her belief in God, which I have no issue with. But, her belief is that God made me to be a girl and not a boy, therefore, I should not be a boy. I do go to the youth services and pay attention to the sermon, and I do partially believe in God, but I’ve been a skeptic ever since I was little. Overall, I’m having an issue talking to my mom about why she thinks I shouldn’t transition because I only get the same or similar answer of “You’re too young and God made you a girl”. She’s understanding though, especially of dysphoria. When she was little she struggled a lot with body image and she didn’t want me to feel the same way, so she allowed me to get a nice binder as long as I paid for it.

2020-10-28 05:31:15,jji3gi,1,1,"So I bought this AliExpress lipstick that I really liked the colour of, but hated the feel as it dried me out. I'm colour blind so my best friend tried to find a match in a better brand but couldn't so she suggested I go and ask the store to help..  at the first store I explained that I'm colour blind and needed help etc etc. They were great but couldn't find a match. At the second store I asked the same thing, but this time she asked ""is this for your...""and I filled in the blanks for her by saying wife. She didn't really try hard and I felt I let myself down by saying wife..

So I went back to store 2 later in the day and found someone else to help. She was amazing! I said that I'm colour blind and need help matching this colour (I took the current lipstick with me), because I really like the colour but it dries out my lips... So there was no ambiguity, I wear lipstick and I'm asking for help for myself...

This is a massive deal for me. I still haven't come out and I'm 45. To have someone just accept me like that really boosted my confidence.. so what about the pizza? Well I put the lipstick on in the car and wore it while driving to the pizza place. I just ordered and picked up while wearing it. It's the first time anyone in public has seen me wearing makeup. I was confident, just ordered like normal, and the cashier just got on with it and didn't care.

I’m unsure if I should tell my therapist that I am trans..

I'm a 26 year old transgender man, I am 3 years on testosterone (HRT) &amp; post top surgery (chest surgery)

I've been having therapy for  8/9 months 
My therapist doesn't know I'm trans and i'm trying to work through some issues which i thought were unrelated..but they may not be..

I get very angry, as if I cannot control it (BPD FEELS) but the other day my therpist asked me if there is anything in my childhood/past which triggered the anger

we discovered it is mostly because I feel very unheard and have done my whole life, we discovered my anger got worst when I was about 12/13...&amp; when they asked me if there is anything that stands out in my mind as to why the anger got so bad then the first thing I thought of is (I didn't say this outloud as they don't know i'm trans) ""probably because I'm trans..."" 

I didn't come out as trans until I was 22 but I told my therpist that I think my anger got worst because I struggled to learn in highschool (I have dyslexia &amp; possible ADHD) and that no one really helped me either..which is true but maybe it is also because I had to life a fake life with a fake name just so people wouldn’t bully me that much, they still did bully me but the abuse subsided rather a lot when I started to dress more fem in high school 

Yeah it fucking sucked not being raised and socialised as a boy, but I was lucky in the sense that during my whole life Ive been allowed to wear what I wanted (boys clothes) play with the toys i wanted (boys toys) and could more or less have my hair how i wanted but, when i started highschool I was bullied because i ""looked like a boy"" so I grew my hair out, &amp; started dressing/acting more fem because i couldn't take the bullying and i needed everyone to leave me alone

I also thought ""meh yeah, maybe everyone is right...I am weird, I am a freak...I need to act like a girl...I guess I should look like a normal girl"" so I changed my apperance to please everybody else..

Now, my questions are:

Do you think I should tell my theripist I am trans? (It makes me uncomfortable when people know, but if it will help me heal and get better/ help my mental health in the long run then I will deal with how it makes me feel)

Has anybody else been in a similar situation? if so, what did you do? 

Do you think the fact that I am trans has more of an inpact/has caused some of this anger more than I realise? 

What would you do in my situation?

That's a bit easier to fix and I do so naturally when playing with others.  \n\n\nVoice surgery also isn't an option at this time as it's very expensive. Any recommendations for changing my voice real-time would be much appreciated.

2020-10-28 17:19:28,jjs0f8,6,1,"The anticipation, racing thoughts, running scenarios in my head over and over throughout all these years about coming out and telling someone built up in me and was terrifying! Why? I was in denial and wasn’t sure even though deep down I really did and just needed to accept myself. 

Well, something came over me and I came out to one new person I recently met (small risk), another friend I’ve know for a year and then I came out to my mom. My heart was racing and anxiety spiked but it went well and I knew she would be the safest person to tell but it was damn liberating! I have no kids and single so I’m free to do as I please and commend those with a spouse and kids bc I couldn’t imagine doing it. Anyway, I still have to come out to my siblings and some friends, but I do know I will lose most of my friends and some extended family but in the end, the weight of many, many years have been lifted a lot. 

My advice for anyone who is as terrified about coming out as I am, take it one step at a time and tell one person you know would be the safest to tell and is most accepting of others in this cultural spectrum. 

Start with yourself and accept who you are. Tell a therapist (suggest a gender therapist) and someone online. The risk is small but you get used to telling someone and are able to reflect on it. Then find someone who you know in the LGBTQ+ community or an accepting friend what’s closer within your inner circle and can fully trust. Feeling safe with that person is important!

2020-10-28 20:11:49,jjvdkt,0,1,"Hello!

I am a medical student in the US. Currently I’m taking a LGBTQIA health disparities course that requires me to interview someone knowledgeable about healthcare disparities affecting the trans community. I would also like to ask questions regarding one’s personal experiences with healthcare providers, including what problems you may have experienced and any suggestions you have to improve how healthcare treats those in the trans community.

Already tried r/Atlanta. No one gave a fuck.

I am looking to get my first tattoo ASAP.

So English unlike my native language doesn’t have genders anymore.

The story doesn’t hint or give you context what gender this person has. 
But I as a speaker of the language that has genders always assign a gender to that person. 
I think in my case it’s male by default because I’m cis male. What do you do?
Does the gender you assign to the character in question always aligns with yours if it doesn’t say otherwise?

I don’t think I can talk with my family, though. I can hardly have a conversation with my mom without her twisting my words and using them to get attention. I’ve been taking senior civics, and MAN it’s nice to actually learn about politics, and not just hear my parents pov. Well, my mom is Catholic, and she’s very strongly against Abortion. I don’t mean to actually get into politics so I don’t plan to share my opinions, but at some point I was basically telling my mom, “pro choice isn’t pro abortion. It means these people don’t think the government have a right to decide this for people. People can disagree with abortion and still be pro choice”. She told my dad I said this (I know this cause I was eavesdropping &gt;.&lt;) and his response is “does he even know what pro choice is?” My mom responds, “I wasn’t going to go there”. Then I find out from my sister this morning, my mom was trying to slowly and subtlety get into the topic with my sister so she could basically ridicule/make fun of me. This, on what should be such a nonchalant topic, being this extreme. I can’t ever imagine talking to them about wanting to cross dress, and/or being transgender. 

When I was 13, I had a better relationship with my mom (well, I was still highly influenced by her and didn’t have too many of my own opinions), and I really, really carefully cryptically tried talking about which what I’m thinking now was dysphoria. Her response was, “you wouldn’t be a very good girl” with this huge smile (the smile makes me so upset, lol). And went on to talk about my uncle who supposedly was going to transition one day, and her point was basically to say he didn’t cause God sent him a sign not to. Which I don’t agree or disagree with that happening, just the point in case, I keep thinking about this and I can’t stand living here. I didn’t really have my own opinions back then, so the dysphoria and questioning just brought on so much guilt. All I needed from her was love, or acceptance, and instead she had to say that. I’ve also been growing out my hair for a couple years now, and she’s asked me if I wanted to get it cut multiple, multiple times. Each time I told her, if I wanted it cut, I would get it cut.

My family is anti LGBT. They are hardcore Christians, so obviously, being trans is an immense sin in their eyes.

Thinking about how I'll get disowned breaks my heart. I know they won't accept me. I'll either have to live my life as a woman and be depressed or be my true self and no longer have a family. And I choose to be my true self, which means I'll be disowned. They'll probably consider me dead.

I wish I was just born a cis guy so I didn't have gender dysphoria. 

I wish I could just be happy. 

I say I'm not trans and that I'm a cis dude and keep myself out of all trans stuff because of how uncomfortable it makes me. 

I'm happy people can be happy to call themselves trans, but calling myself trans just gives me extreme dysphoria and makes me want to curl up and die. 

When I talk about these problems online people call me a transmed or transcum and it makes me even more upset.

I hate how I know even if I get all the surgeries I want to make myself look like a guy it will never be enough. 

I'll never get to experience sexual stuff like cis guys do like ejaculating, getting morning wood or having a prostate. 

I hate how I can't tell my trans friends I'm trans, because people knowing I wasn't born male makes me want to die. 

I can't tell them I relate to what they've experience, because I'll end up hating myself. 

I hate how I want to leave my supportive family behind and start a new life so no one will know I was born female. 

I hate how I'm too scared to have a boyfriend out of fear they find out I wasn't born male like I want people to think I am, even if they themselves were trans or the most accepting husband in the world it still makes me want to breakdown and live alone for the reason of my life.

If it had the smallest bit of pink, the smallest fringe, a low cut, anything, it was gone. 95% of my closet. 

I started building up my closet on masculine things. If it was even slighting feminine, even if I liked it, I wouldn’t get it. I was thrown into this toxic masculinity. I was put under this belief that in order for me to be a boy, I couldn’t like feminine things. 

Then about a year later, I started learning I didn’t have to be extremely masculine to be a boy. I can like feminine things if I want to. I went against a ton of trauma I had and bought a skirt. I sat there for an hour looking at the skirt and trying to build up the courage to just put it on. Eventually I did it, and I loved it, so I bought more. 

I pushed myself far out of my comfort zone. I went against everything I had been told about being a trans guy. I felt so proud of myself. It became a normal thing to see my in a skirt. I felt confident in myself. I’m a trans guy, and I love skirts. 

Then people got mad at me. They told me I was a girl. They told me I was just trying to get attention, and that I was a “trender”. Just because I like to wear a damn skirt. 

This really tore me up. I went through all that trauma and struggle to accept myself only to not be accepted by the trans community?

I’m a boy. What I wear can’t change that. If cis men can wear skirts and crop tops and still be men, why can’t I? What happened to “trans guys are guys” and that we’re just as much of men as cis men?

2020-10-31 07:52:02,jleikj,7,1,"I've (26F) posted ranting about my parents (60-ishM, 60-ishF) before.

My parents have not at all been the most kind to me over my three+ year transition.  At first it was refusal to use my name/pronouns.  Then came the belittling that I'd never be a woman, nothing I could do would ever make me one, and that everyone on the street would know I'm trans.  That all my friends are simply playing along with my little ruse because ""They're my friends and they'll say anything to stay your friend,"" .

It then escalated over the months to my mother asking me how my transition made THEM feel, how I affected THEM, how I was forcing them to use pronouns I so desperately wanted them to use.

Later I realized they were only tolerating my existence because I was their child. LGBTQ rights meant nothing to them.  Gay marriage didn't matter.  They didn't fight for me.  They never tried learning.  Out of both sides of my family (and my sister) nobody has such a huge deal with me than they have.

As the years passed I noticed as long as I didn't talk to them about their view on trans rights, gay marriage, what they felt about my relationships, that I'm a lesbian... everything was fine.  As long as I never mentioned a hot-button issue we were peachy keen.

Then today happened.

I asked the ill-fated question,

""Who did you vote for?""

Of course the answer was Trump.  I asked them if it mattered that his re-election could mean the end to my rights.  No comment beyond they voted for him because he'd ""Make the biggest difference to more people"" than Biden would.  I don't like either of them but it's the lesser of two evils.  My mom told me they were too busy to watch Trump talk about the community and she didn't know even though I told her months ago how our healthcare was in danger.

I'm extremely disappointed in them.  Not that I'm surprised.  But I want to cut them off more than ever, yet at the same time am I overreacting?  Am I making a bigger fuss out of the past three years than I should?  If they weren't my parents the answer would be obvious: **Yes, of course cut them off.  Fuck them.**  I don't find the answer that easy... their treatment of me isn't hostile.  It's not malicious.  They've come around a little to me and the community.

But not to the point where they respect us as a whole.  That ALL of our rights are in danger.  That our very existence is shadowed with regulations, rules, hate crimes, everything.  They so easily marked us for dead without so much as batting an eyelash.

I know it sounds stupid.  I've been debating this all night in my head.  I feel like I'd be making a terrible decision.  I don't know.  I don't know anymore.  Some days are good, some days are terrible.   I can't tell if they really support me or if they're doing it out of obligation.  I want to cry so fucking much...

&amp;#x200B;

2020-10-31 20:26:06,jlpgnc,6,1,"Just did a little wikipedia digging around these terms and their history and honestly all I can say is that it seems like a clusterf*ck that happened because everybody was offended by some aspect they interpreted into these words. Now don't get me wrong, I've also experienced a sort of relief when I finally associated myself with one or more of these labels. But seriously transgender *apparently* means being uncomfortable with ones agab, transsexual isn't offensive but means trying to medically transition from one end of the spectrum to the other and queer is basically the same as transgender, rendering the Q in LGBTQ redundant (??).

Honestly, I get how these labels can be affirming and if they do something for you (and that sometimes includes me) I'm happy for you but I feel like these labels are becoming bigger than what they try to describe.

Let me put it this way: During my journey I've often felt like I don't want to identify as any gender and saying ""I'm a man"" hurt while saying ""I'm a woman"" hurt less. ""I'm nonbinary"" felt wrong, as did ""I'm genderfluid"". In retrospect this is probably what being agender feels like (??). And everytime I got to the point of being able to confidently say ""I'm a woman"" I thought ""phew, that feels good, that's progress"". But these phases of preferring to refer to myself as me kept coming and they made me anxious as to why I wasn't able to identify as a woman. Now I think all that made me anxious was _confining_ myself to a label. But there's really no need to do that. I'm &lt;whatever&gt; I want to have a female body and go by female pronouns and if you want to call me transgender, that's just as fine as calling me transsexual or transsex. But I won't be limited by these labels and if I exhibit traits that break the confines of these labels that sounds very much like a ""you"" problem.

As leslie feinberg put it, _transgender_ is not a self-identifier but a category imposed by observers.

And again, I don't have anything against those labels, but I feel like trying to pathologically find labels that perfectly fit a person can be a great source of anxiety, ignores the person themselves, ultimately is a categorization and is in addition inherently impossible.

2020-10-31 21:15:42,jlqaof,2,1,"Hello! This is my first post here, my name is Ciri and I have been transitioning (mtf) for 13 months now. On September 3rd of this year I began my HRT treatment and was prescribed 2mg of Estradiol once per day. This was initially strange to me as I have only ever seen other cases getting 2mg twice a day as well as T blockers. My endocrinologist told me the absence of initial T blockers was good so my estrogen levels would increase before we decrease my testosterone levels. It made sense to me but I have never heard of any cases where the two medications aren’t prescribed at the same time.
It is now about two months in and I have seen no changes or progress in any way. It doesn’t seem like my doctor will be prescribing me anything more or increasing my dose anytime in the near future. I just wanted to post my thoughts on this and see if anyone here is in the same situation or has been prescribed less than the usual 2mg twice per day and the T blockers to accompany.
