So Before coming out I didnt have dysphoria, I grew up not completely hating my body, but not really liking it either. always feeling more feminine inside.

 a couple of years ago I started questioning my appearance and gender along with it.
Since I have been presenting as a woman for a while and with that came gender euphoria which is great. although allot of social anxiety has come with that too over constantly feeling I look silly and just generally not seen as a woman properly in society.

2020-07-01 02:35:00,hj1q5m,0,1,"I recently had a first name change in Orange County in the state of Florida. I am not trans but I know that trans people are the most likely people to change their first name. I wanted to share my experience since it was hard to find information when I was starting the process, particularly in my area where you are required to change your name by court order. The stories from the trans community were a huge help in not only navigating the process but comforting me, and I wanted to give back by sharing my personal experiences.

A couple things I wanted to highlight: Save a copy of your old documents (license, passport) as well as making digital copies of new documents (social security card, driver's license, court order). A few companies requested I show an old and new photo ID to change my information. I also ended up having to pay the courts to get a copy of my initial petition for the health department in my birth state, so keep a completed copy. And finally, I will not link any forms in this summary because I discovered myself that forms change all the time. The name change petition for Orange County cost $10 to download all the forms from the county courts site, and it was worth every penny. The courts site does offer the forms but there are a lot to sort through, and other websites will often show outdated forms or incomplete forms. I saw other people at the office having to pay and fill them out there because they had brought in the wrong forms. I also saw tons of posts online sharing only ONE name change form, when there are several.

If you are preparing to change your name and also planning to move in the not so distant future, I highly recommend exploring the options in your old and new area. In my old county, I did not want to proceed with my name change because I had to publish my information in the newspaper before I could petition the court. My new county does not have the newspaper requirement. It also cost me $412.50 just to file the petition, not including the fingerprint background check that you also had to complete before filing. Every county will charge a different amount so definitely look into the cost for your new and old location before deciding where to file at. I also plan to move abroad in the future and found that any name change would have to be done in the US and would be a huge pain to transition into my future country so I opted to do it before I moved.

Orange County requires an authorized agency perform an electronic fingerprint that is sent to FDLE and the FBI for a background check. In the name change packet I purchased it actually had a list of companies that were authorized. I searched by city name to find someone nearby that did remote fingerprinting. He came to my office and took about 20 minutes to take my fingerprints. He told me that the courts would receive the fingerprints the next day (taken on Thursday) but I waited until Monday to go to the courthouse and file my petition. You are only allowed to file your petition at the Orange County Courthouse on N Orange Ave (room 320/330). You need your form notarized but the notary cost on site is cheap and they also review your document before you file it. They do accept credit card with a small fee, as well as cash and check with no fee. You will be paying the filing fee ($412.50 as of this post) when you go so plan ahead for that.

I filed my case on March 9th. I received a notice of hearing on March 11th. My hearing was initially scheduled on March 24th, but due to COVID was rescheduled for May 19th. Ultimately my hearing was done over the phone on the rescheduled date. I was on the call about 5 minutes before the scheduled time, and was in a conference call with several other people as well as the judge assigned to my case. I verified my identity, confirmed I didn't want the name change to avoid debt etc, and explained why I wanted a name change. There was absolutely 0 judgement regarding why I wanted it, all I said was that I didn't like my old first name and wanted to change it. I know that Orange County does typically do name change cases with others at the same time. If you end up with other people present, I can honestly say that I had no idea or care why everyone else was there because I was way too nervous about my own hearing. I couldn't even focus on what everyone else was saying. My final judgement was mailed out on the 21st and I received it the following week. I was very nervous about this process but it was honestly really painless and fairly quick outside of the COVID delay. There is also a form that you can complete if you need to change the scheduled hearing date for any reason.

-----------------------------------------

Below are just my specific experiences after the court process:

The first thing I had to replace was my social security card. Since offices are closed due to COVID I was able to mail in my court order and the form for a replacement social security card. You will have to go in person if the office is not closed. My court order indicates my former name, new name, date of birth, and birth location. When I called they told me that if it didn't contain that information I would need to include another form of identification that did to verify, so keep that in mind if you are mailing in this form.

In my state, the DMV requires that your name be fully updated with the social security office before they will issue a new driver's license. I waited until I received my new card to go to the DMV. They scanned a copy of my court order. On the DMV site it said I would need multiple documents to verify my former identity as well as my address, which I did bring but they didn't ask for. I plan to get married in the near future and was told by the DMV that I would need to bring my court order as well as my marriage license when that change happened. At the DMV you can also update your voter registration and any vehicle titles. I had my driver's license replaced two weeks ago and still haven't seen an update on my voter registration so be careful around election time as it seems to be quite delayed.

Once those two things were checked off, most everything is simple. Most places allowed me to upload the documents or e-mail them. Only a few places required a mailed copy. Some companies that initially told me over the phone that it had been taken care of actually sent me a letter requesting physical copies. Most companies will have an FAQ page for name change instructions. Try to get a list together of everywhere that is essential to get updated. Banks, Insurance, Student Loans, Paypal and similar cash apps, reward programs, etc. I also updated my name on any websites I actively use that I would need to show identification to recover an account, and updated my name for shipping and billing addresses. With my debit card and credit card, I had to upload the documents, wait for them to be reviewed (usually took 1-2 days), and then I called to request new cards. I recommend calling in, as I was able to continue using my old cards until replacements arrived, whereas online forms assume they are lost/stolen and freeze them.

I have insurance through the healthcare marketplace. For this change, I had to make a life change to my plan, complete the application with my new name, and re-select my current health and dental plan. Once that was done, it took about 3 days for the companies to automatically update my plan with the new name. I then had to call in to request a replacement card since the website service wasn't working. If you're concerned about messing it up, you can call in and have a representative change your plan for you.

If you are doing a name change during COVID, keep in mind a lot of companies have long wait times for customer service. One company I have a card with doesn't even have anyone available for customer service and doesn't allow name changes online. I carry a copy of my court order while I wait to get all my new documents and cards. Another important thing, I had a travel voucher with Southwest Airlines. They do not change the name on the voucher, and to use it after a name change you have to call in and use the voucher to book the flight over the phone as well as e-mailing them the documents from the name change. I am also not able to update my passport due to COVID. I have no plans to travel abroad right now, and have read online previously that you may be able to get by with the court order, new ID and old passport, but I don't know for sure and something to consider if you are changing your name during COVID.

I will add on just to say that I was not employed when my name change was finalized due to COVID, but remember to notify your employer. I was planning to do it after updating my banking information.

Changing my name has been such an amazing feeling for me. I have always felt that the name I was given was not who I was. I selected my new name based primarily on wanting to keep my old initials, and it was a nickname I went by for years before I changed it, so I knew it was right for me. It has been a hassle but was worth every second, and the happiness I feel every time I get a piece of mail with my new name on it is priceless. If you are planning to change your name, I hope that this has helped you and I wish you the best of luck.

My Long ass story.... told in 4 parts.

\[MY BIO\]

 I'm a Dominican college student from the Bronx (23) who has an associates film degree from a community college. I love telling stories--whether that be writing plays for theater or making short films with my friends. My inspirations include Lin Manuel Miranda, Joss Whedon, &amp; The Wachowskis. I've always dreamed of being an artist as a career and living in NYC my whole life has made that dream so close to taste. I've had so many cool opportunities at my community college--like being a PA for a documentary project at a big film festival, being apart of a playwright group with MFA students in their 30s (it felt weird being the youngest one there, lol), and making a short horror film with my friends at a summer camp. I began my journey at community college after dropping out of an insanely good private college where I got a full ride for engineering. My family was incredibly disappointed in me for dropping out--but I think the best thing that's ever happened to me was discovering film at my community college. I have really bad body dysmorphia ever since I was a child, and I also have a disability called developmental coordination disorder, so I really suck with my motor skills. Growing up I didn't have many normative childhood experiences due to always hating my body and being disabled. I sucked at sports, dancing, skateboarding, anything that required physical activity. I've always struggled to come to terms with my adulthood and feel independent because of my disability--while longing for an adolescence I never got to fully have. Filmmaking is the only thing I've ever found that has given me a voice and allowed me to have fun and explore my inner child.

\[FAMILY\]

My best friend growing up was my mom--she was the breadwinner of our household and the first to go to a college. An amazing Dominican immigrant who worked hard to be the head of her department at CitiBank. When I was 12, she had a brain aneursym because of the stress of her job--and while she survived and had a very expensive surgery to be with us today--she's not the same person she was. She's very dependent on my father and me since she's mentally regressed to being part child/part adult. I love her to pieces but its' always been hard to me accept that the strong women she was is gone. She resigns herself to staying indoors in our horrendous neighborhood where loud trap music is played on the streets all day, occasionally having run-ins with our drug abusing neighbors who harass her because of her disability, and generally not being able to do anything fun that she enjoys doing---like painting, going out to restaurant, or just even walking outside by herself. My mom is still incredibly intelligent after her incident and we can have these great elaborate conversations about our lives, telenovelas, art--and shes just so funny and full of life despite her condition. But I feel like the time we have together is dwindling, and our family will just never know life outside the Bronx. I always grew up wanting to be like my mom when she was a career woman. I idolized her.

My father is the exact opposite of everything I've ever wanted to be. He's had a hard life being a campensino from the D.R.-and its a classic tale of toxic masculinity that I'm sure you all know. My father warned me that ""I better not be gay"" when I was 8 because the other school kids were teasing me. But--he had no problem there. I've always loved women. SO much. Infact--to this day, I still romanticize the idea of having a girlfriend. I've not yet kissed anyone or had any romantic physical contact my entire life. I've had opportunities--but body dysmorphia. ANYWHO...  my father was very abusive to me because of my disability. I always felt uncomfortable around him in any room. And I always felt like I had to be protective of my mother because her disability was way worse than mine. Constant yelling and calling me and my mom retards, constantly making us feel dependent on him and any chance to build up any independence was quickly put down. My father is a narcissist who forced his family to love him out of fear. Ultimately my relationship with my father ended very poorly because it led to me getting kicked out my house (read part 3!) ,but I eventually returned to my family to because of the COVID epidemic.

My brother is not my father's son so he never related to him, and he's gay. He is incredibly accomplished in life, made it out of the Bronx, and is a marketing executive who has a really nice studio apartment in Brooklyn. I want to be where he's at in life and he loves me and my mom, but it's always been at a distance because he's always felt pressured to support our family since he's the one ""who made it."" He sees me as his immature kid brother--which is fair because I've gotten into a lot of shit into the years and still don't have my shit together. I feel like it's hard to open up to him without judgement--and he's very jaded about our family since he grew up having no trust towards my father, being well aware of my mom being manipulated by my dad, being cast out of the extended family for being gay, and surviving as a gay man in the Bronx. I always feel like we could have an incredible sibling relationship but there's a lot of family trauma. Also I was a homophobic little shit up until I found out my best friend is bi.

My only friend up until college was my cousin, who happens to be bisexual, and we always had fun growing up enjoying a shared love of storytelling. Any scifi-movie with a bad-ass female protagonist was our jam, doing karoake to sugary pop music, or roleplaying scenarios in videogames (we'd make our own machinimas in like smash brothers for example). My cousin was also way more social than me, so he'd drag me kicking and screaming to any parties or group events and was basically my social lifeline. He's helped me through a lot of rough times, which has put a strain on our relationship.

My family has always been poor and dysfunctional. We've been through alot--and lately I've been feeling really insecure about my dreams and one day making it out of the hood. It almost feels impossible at times.

Shout out to any New Yorkers out here who know the struggle.

\[TLDR; Life Goes to shit &amp; Transition Thoughts\]

After dropping out of private college, being out of school for a year, and attending community college--things were incredibly tense at home with my family. My brother moved out and made his life--and my neighborhood and our financial debt at home just got worse and worse. My father got increasingly irritated about living in the Bronx, would call me his failure son, and be very mean to my mom. He worked very long hours as a bus driver, and I wasn't contributing to any bills at the time. I found escape in my community college's film club and writing classes--but made a mistake that cost me a year of my life.

One night I was drunk, depressed, and frustrated. I had lost a piece of camera equipment I couldn't afford to pay off at school, and my hours were getting cut at the restaurant I worked at because I kept dropping food due to my poor motor skills. I came home to my father yelling at me about closing the bathroom door too hard. I told him to go fuck himself, and he woke up and hit me in the face. We got into a very violent fight, he put an order of protection on me, and I officially had my first record every for third degree assault.

This violent outburst is very unlike me--I haven't gotten into a fight since high school. My brother had to bail me out of jail and get me a lawyer to clear my case, while I navigated finding a job and passing my classes all at the same time. I crashed on my cousin's bedroom floor in secret from my aunt, and ate the spare food at the restaurant I worked at (where I was on the verge of getting fired for my poor performance). Eventually I did get fired, and ended up finding a place to stay permanently in a really shitty room in an overcrowded house with an Ecuadorian family I found on Roomi in a bad neighborhood in Queens where there was no credit check, and paid the landlady through CashApp. No kitchen use allowed, and my landlady and her family were borderline insane. My brother spotted my first month's rent while I found a job, which was damn near impossible with my record. Eventually I did get my job at T-Mobile, through a photography friend I had made from one of my film activities. While they saw my record, I fought tooth and nail with several recommendations from previous employers to dispute why I should be able to work there. It took nearly 2 months and several rounds of interviews to go through the HR Process to get the job.

Meanwhile, any day I wasn't looking for a job I was going to a community center for LGBT youth to get free meals, and giving my all to my film classes. I made a friend in my film professor, who is the sweetest man I've ever met and the only positive male role model I've ever had in life.  He showed me it was possible to be a 40 year old male and be a total nerdy kidult goofball while having a professional job and being role model to your community. That there were alternatives to being this hardened, macho, sexist, self-serious man my father and all my uncles were. If I were to stay male--I'd want to be like him. I opened up to him about my situation, and he helped me with my court case to clear my misdemeanor, helped me pass my classes, and encouraged me to keep going to the campus film club. At the end of the semester--while I was still jobless and struggling to eat--he encouraged me to make a film about my disability for a film festival.

 I won a $500 scholarship to pay rent with, and was then offered by my professor along with 10 other art students to go to a summer art camp for 10 days which was the happiest week of my entire life. Words couldn't describe how great it was to be in nature (I've never had that coming from the Bronx), and being with other creatives doing what I love. A lot of the students from that camp are still my friends to this day. We also learned a lot of great meditation exercises--and I now consider myself a Buddhist because of the experience.

Everything worked out. I had a home (a shitty one where I was super uncomfortable--but I wasn't homeless), a job that was okay for my disability and paid the bills, and was still attending school. But things were still really hard. Not being able to see my mom sucked--and my impulsive and selfish actions ruined my relationships with my cousin and my brother. My summer camp friends ended up being the only friends I had--and my emotional baggage at the time proved difficult to discuss and alienated me a lot from them. I was depressed all the time and not fun to be around. 

It got to a point where I was suicidal. I couldn't take coming to that home anymore to a similar scene I saw with my family--the landlady's daughter fighting with her boyfriend violently or having loud sex every night, annoying loud kids, my religious zealot landlady being OCD about the cleanliness of her house to the point where I felt dirty existing there, the overpriced rent and constant restrictions, not being able to use the kitchen and having no air conditioning during the summer or heating during the winter, and living in an absolutely filthy room I didn't have the energy to clean due to being exhausted from work and school.

Around Christmas my brother was organizing me to see my mom at his house. He was proud I was still in school and wanted us three to spend time together. But--I really wanted to end it all the day before. I was considering popping sleeping pills and alcohol until I wouldn't wake up. But then something came over me--to get out the house. To do anything but be there. 

I went to an H&amp;M and crossdressed for the first time December 23rd, 2019. I didn't feel euphoric--just incomplete. And curious. Two days later, on the 25th, I saw my mom and my brother together for the first time in months. I was happy--but my world was rocked my this discovery and it fueled more self-hatred.

\[EPILOGUE\]

June 2020 I'm living with my parents in the Bronx again. I moved back in March after asking permission to my dad to come back because of COVID. He has changed alot--and is realizing his mistakes and his old age. I still don't feel like I can trust him completely and probably never will--but it was the right decision to come back and be able to hug my mom again. I still have my job at T-Mobile, and have 1 class left to graduate my community college. I'm applied to go upstate to school to an LGBT friendly SUNY to be free and queer for the first time ever.

Every single day I think about cross-dressing and transitioning, and feel guilty that it is not safe to do so in my neighbourhood, at my job, or because of the circumstances I'm surrounded by living in the Bronx. I feel trapped and suffocated--like I can't be me. The only escape I have is watching Bianca (MJ RODRIGUES IS AN ICON!!!) on POSE and identifying with her story.

But I'm not even sure its what I want? I'd dread losing the safety and security of being a man and I don't want to kill off who I've been the past 23 years. He was going to be a great dude and father one day. I'm just so confused.

I'm safer, happier, and healthier, than I was last year--and have definitely made a lot of progress towards adulthood. But I feel like being feminine, or the desire to be the person my mom once was--IS WRONG.  I still have this constant tug of war of wanting to stay a man versus wanting to become a woman--mainly because of the context of how I grew up and how I know my community will just not accept me. How I'm tired of being in poverty and desperately want better for myself and my family. Being trans feels like another setback. Like I have to startover again like when I stupidly blew my opportunity at the private school I went to. I still don't know if it's a weird hobby or who I really am and am TOTALLY unable to even entertain the idea because of how dangerous it is to be LGBT in the Bronx.

I'm just scared. And with COVID--god knows if I can even go upstate and explore who I am, let alone do the only thing I love in filmmaking.

I feel like a mindless automaton at work, and I feel like I will never escape the toxic masculinity of the world I am in.

I'm tired of this world. I know the world is so much bigger than the Bronx. So much brighter and more beautiful than I could even imagine. But I feel like I won't make it to see that day. To share my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening to my story. Noone's going to read like the 4 pages I've practically wrote here, but it feels good to release it to the internet.

I love telling stories--whether that be writing plays for theater or making short films with my friends. My inspirations include Lin Manuel Miranda, Joss Whedon, &amp; The Wachowskis. I\'ve always dreamed of being an artist as a career and living in NYC my whole life has made that dream so close to taste. I\'ve had so many cool opportunities at my community college--like being a PA for a documentary project at a big film festival, being apart of a playwright group with MFA students in their 30s (it felt weird being the youngest one there, lol), and making a short horror film with my friends at a summer camp. I began my journey at community college after dropping out of an insanely good private college where I got a full ride for engineering. My family was incredibly disappointed in me for dropping out--but I think the best thing that\'s ever happened to me was discovering film at my community college. I have really bad body dysmorphia ever since I was a child, and I also have a disability called developmental coordination disorder, so I really suck with my motor skills. Growing up I didn\'t have many normative childhood experiences due to always hating my body and being disabled. I sucked at sports, dancing, skateboarding, anything that required physical activity. I\'ve always struggled to come to terms with my adulthood and feel independent because of my disability--while longing for an adolescence I never got to fully have. Filmmaking is the only thing I\'ve ever found that has given me a voice and allowed me to have fun and explore my inner child.\n\n\\[FAMILY\\]\n\nMy best friend growing up was my mom--she was the breadwinner of our household and the first to go to a college. An amazing Dominican immigrant who worked hard to be the head of her department at CitiBank. When I was 12, she had a brain aneursym because of the stress of her job--and while she survived and had a very expensive surgery to be with us today--she\'s not the same person she was. She\'s very dependent on my father and me since she\'s mentally regressed to being part child/part adult. I love her to pieces but its\' always been hard to me accept that the strong women she was is gone. She resigns herself to staying indoors in our horrendous neighborhood where loud trap music is played on the streets all day, occasionally having run-ins with our drug abusing neighbors who harass her because of her disability, and generally not being able to do anything fun that she enjoys doing---like painting, going out to restaurant, or just even walking outside by herself. My mom is still incredibly intelligent after her incident and we can have these great elaborate conversations about our lives, telenovelas, art--and shes just so funny and full of life despite her condition. But I feel like the time we have together is dwindling, and our family will just never know life outside the Bronx. I always grew up wanting to be like my mom when she was a career woman. I idolized her.\n\nMy father is the exact opposite of everything I\'ve ever wanted to be. He\'s had a hard life being a campensino from the D.R.-and its a classic tale of toxic masculinity that I\'m sure you all know. My father warned me that ""I better not be gay"" when I was 8 because the other school kids were teasing me. But--he had no problem there. I\'ve always loved women. SO much. Infact--to this day, I still romanticize the idea of having a girlfriend. I\'ve not yet kissed anyone or had any romantic physical contact my entire life. I\'ve had opportunities--but body dysmorphia. ANYWHO...  my father was very abusive to me because of my disability. I always felt uncomfortable around him in any room. And I always felt like I had to be protective of my mother because her disability was way worse than mine. Constant yelling and calling me and my mom retards, constantly making us feel dependent on him and any chance to build up any independence was quickly put down. My father is a narcissist who forced his family to love him out of fear. Ultimately my relationship with my father ended very poorly because it led to me getting kicked out my house (read part 3!) ,but I eventually returned to my family to because of the COVID epidemic.\n\nMy brother is not my father\'s son so he never related to him, and he\'s gay. He is incredibly accomplished in life, made it out of the Bronx, and is a marketing executive who has a really nice studio apartment in Brooklyn. I want to be where he\'s at in life and he loves me and my mom, but it\'s always been at a distance because he\'s always felt pressured to support our family since he\'s the one ""who made it."" He sees me as his immature kid brother--which is fair because I\'ve gotten into a lot of shit into the years and still don\'t have my shit together. I feel like it\'s hard to open up to him without judgement--and he\'s very jaded about our family since he grew up having no trust towards my father, being well aware of my mom being manipulated by my dad, being cast out of the extended family for being gay, and surviving as a gay man in the Bronx. I always feel like we could have an incredible sibling relationship but there\'s a lot of family trauma. Also I was a homophobic little shit up until I found out my best friend is bi.\n\nMy only friend up until college was my cousin, who happens to be bisexual, and we always had fun growing up enjoying a shared love of storytelling. Any scifi-movie with a bad-ass female protagonist was our jam, doing karoake to sugary pop music, or roleplaying scenarios in videogames (we\'d make our own machinimas in like smash brothers for example). My cousin was also way more social than me, so he\'d drag me kicking and screaming to any parties or group events and was basically my social lifeline. He\'s helped me through a lot of rough times, which has put a strain on our relationship.\n\nMy family has always been poor and dysfunctional. We\'ve been through alot--and lately I\'ve been feeling really insecure about my dreams and one day making it out of the hood. It almost feels impossible at times.\n\nShout out to any New Yorkers out here who know the struggle.\n\n\\[TLDR; Life Goes to shit &amp; Transition Thoughts\\]\n\nAfter dropping out of private college, being out of school for a year, and attending community college--things were incredibly tense at home with my family. My brother moved out and made his life--and my neighborhood and our financial debt at home just got worse and worse. My father got increasingly irritated about living in the Bronx, would call me his failure son, and be very mean to my mom. He worked very long hours as a bus driver, and I wasn\'t contributing to any bills at the time. I found escape in my community college\'s film club and writing classes--but made a mistake that cost me a year of my life.\n\nOne night I was drunk, depressed, and frustrated. I had lost a piece of camera equipment I couldn\'t afford to pay off at school, and my hours were getting cut at the restaurant I worked at because I kept dropping food due to my poor motor skills. I came home to my father yelling at me about closing the bathroom door too hard. I told him to go fuck himself, and he woke up and hit me in the face. We got into a very violent fight, he put an order of protection on me, and I officially had my first record every for third degree assault.\n\nThis violent outburst is very unlike me--I haven\'t gotten into a fight since high school. My brother had to bail me out of jail and get me a lawyer to clear my case, while I navigated finding a job and passing my classes all at the same time. I crashed on my cousin\'s bedroom floor in secret from my aunt, and ate the spare food at the restaurant I worked at (where I was on the verge of getting fired for my poor performance). Eventually I did get fired, and ended up finding a place to stay permanently in a really shitty room in an overcrowded house with an Ecuadorian family I found on Roomi in a bad neighborhood in Queens where there was no credit check, and paid the landlady through CashApp. No kitchen use allowed, and my landlady and her family were borderline insane. My brother spotted my first month\'s rent while I found a job, which was damn near impossible with my record. Eventually I did get my job at T-Mobile, through a photography friend I had made from one of my film activities. While they saw my record, I fought tooth and nail with several recommendations from previous employers to dispute why I should be able to work there. It took nearly 2 months and several rounds of interviews to go through the HR Process to get the job.\n\nMeanwhile, any day I wasn\'t looking for a job I was going to a community center for LGBT youth to get free meals, and giving my all to my film classes. I made a friend in my film professor, who is the sweetest man I\'ve ever met and the only positive male role model I\'ve ever had in life.  He showed me it was possible to be a 40 year old male and be a total nerdy kidult goofball while having a professional job and being role model to your community. That there were alternatives to being this hardened, macho, sexist, self-serious man my father and all my uncles were. If I were to stay male--I\'d want to be like him. I opened up to him about my situation, and he helped me with my court case to clear my misdemeanor, helped me pass my classes, and encouraged me to keep going to the campus film club.

My Long ass story.... told in 4 parts.

\[MY BIO\]

 I'm a Dominican college student from the Bronx (23) who has an associates film degree from a community college. I love telling stories--whether that be writing plays for theater or making short films with my friends. My inspirations include Lin Manuel Miranda, Joss Whedon, &amp; The Wachowskis. I've always dreamed of being an artist as a career and living in NYC my whole life has made that dream so close to taste. I've had so many cool opportunities at my community college--like being a PA for a documentary project at a big film festival, being apart of a playwright group with MFA students in their 30s (it felt weird being the youngest one there, lol), and making a short horror film with my friends at a summer camp.

\[TLDR; Life Goes to shit &amp; Transition Thoughts\]

After dropping out of private college, being out of school for a year, and attending community college--things were incredibly tense at home with my family. My brother moved out and made his life--and my neighborhood and our financial debt at home just got worse and worse. My father got increasingly irritated about living in the Bronx, would call me his failure son, and be very mean to my mom.

Two days later, on the 25th, I saw my mom and my brother together for the first time in months. I was happy--but my world was rocked my this discovery and it fueled more self-hatred.

\[EPILOGUE\]

June 2020 I'm living with my parents in the Bronx again. I moved back in March after asking permission to my dad to come back because of COVID. He has changed alot--and is realizing his mistakes and his old age. I still don't feel like I can trust him completely and probably never will--but it was the right decision to come back and be able to hug my mom again. I still have my job at T-Mobile, and have 1 class left to graduate my community college. I'm applied to go upstate to school to an LGBT friendly SUNY to be free and queer for the first time ever.

Every single day I think about cross-dressing and transitioning, and feel guilty that it is not safe to do so in my neighbourhood, at my job, or because of the circumstances I'm surrounded by living in the Bronx. I feel trapped and suffocated--like I can't be me. The only escape I have is watching Bianca (MJ RODRIGUES IS AN ICON!!!) on POSE and identifying with her story.

But I'm not even sure its what I want? I'd dread losing the safety and security of being a man and I don't want to kill off who I've been the past 23 years. He was going to be a great dude and father one day. I'm just so confused.

I'm safer, happier, and healthier, than I was last year--and have definitely made a lot of progress towards adulthood. But I feel like being feminine, or the desire to be the person my mom once was--IS WRONG.  I still have this constant tug of war of wanting to stay a man versus wanting to become a woman--mainly because of the context of how I grew up and how I know my community will just not accept me. How I'm tired of being in poverty and desperately want better for myself and my family. Being trans feels like another setback. Like I have to startover again like when I stupidly blew my opportunity at the private school I went to. I still don't know if it's a weird hobby or who I really am and am TOTALLY unable to even entertain the idea because of how dangerous it is to be LGBT in the Bronx.

I'm just scared. And with COVID--god knows if I can even go upstate and explore who I am, let alone do the only thing I love in filmmaking.

I feel like a mindless automaton at work, and I feel like I will never escape the toxic masculinity of the world I am in.

I'm tired of this world. I know the world is so much bigger than the Bronx. So much brighter and more beautiful than I could even imagine. But I feel like I won't make it to see that day. To share my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening to my story. Noone's going to read like the 4 pages I've practically wrote here, but it feels good to release it to the internet.

I love telling stories--whether that be writing plays for theater or making short films with my friends. My inspirations include Lin Manuel Miranda, Joss Whedon, &amp; The Wachowskis. I\'ve always dreamed of being an artist as a career and living in NYC my whole life has made that dream so close to taste. I\'ve had so many cool opportunities at my community college--like being a PA for a documentary project at a big film festival, being apart of a playwright group with MFA students in their 30s (it felt weird being the youngest one there, lol), and making a short horror film with my friends at a summer camp. I began my journey at community college after dropping out of an insanely good private college where I got a full ride for engineering. My family was incredibly disappointed in me for dropping out--but I think the best thing that\'s ever happened to me was discovering film at my community college. I have really bad body dysmorphia ever since I was a child, and I also have a disability called developmental coordination disorder, so I really suck with my motor skills. Growing up I didn\'t have many normative childhood experiences due to always hating my body and being disabled. I sucked at sports, dancing, skateboarding, anything that required physical activity. I\'ve always struggled to come to terms with my adulthood and feel independent because of my disability--while longing for an adolescence I never got to fully have. Filmmaking is the only thing I\'ve ever found that has given me a voice and allowed me to have fun and explore my inner child.\n\n\\[FAMILY\\]\n\nMy best friend growing up was my mom--she was the breadwinner of our household and the first to go to a college. An amazing Dominican immigrant who worked hard to be the head of her department at CitiBank. When I was 12, she had a brain aneursym because of the stress of her job--and while she survived and had a very expensive surgery to be with us today--she\'s not the same person she was. She\'s very dependent on my father and me since she\'s mentally regressed to being part child/part adult. I love her to pieces but its\' always been hard to me accept that the strong women she was is gone. She resigns herself to staying indoors in our horrendous neighborhood where loud trap music is played on the streets all day, occasionally having run-ins with our drug abusing neighbors who harass her because of her disability, and generally not being able to do anything fun that she enjoys doing---like painting, going out to restaurant, or just even walking outside by herself. My mom is still incredibly intelligent after her incident and we can have these great elaborate conversations about our lives, telenovelas, art--and shes just so funny and full of life despite her condition. But I feel like the time we have together is dwindling, and our family will just never know life outside the Bronx. I always grew up wanting to be like my mom when she was a career woman. I idolized her.\n\nMy father is the exact opposite of everything I\'ve ever wanted to be. He\'s had a hard life being a campensino from the D.R.-and its a classic tale of toxic masculinity that I\'m sure you all know. My father warned me that ""I better not be gay"" when I was 8 because the other school kids were teasing me. But--he had no problem there. I\'ve always loved women. SO much. Infact--to this day, I still romanticize the idea of having a girlfriend. I\'ve not yet kissed anyone or had any romantic physical contact my entire life. I\'ve had opportunities--but body dysmorphia. ANYWHO...  my father was very abusive to me because of my disability. I always felt uncomfortable around him in any room. And I always felt like I had to be protective of my mother because her disability was way worse than mine. Constant yelling and calling me and my mom retards, constantly making us feel dependent on him and any chance to build up any independence was quickly put down. My father is a narcissist who forced his family to love him out of fear. Ultimately my relationship with my father ended very poorly because it led to me getting kicked out my house (read part 3!) ,but I eventually returned to my family to because of the COVID epidemic.\n\nMy brother is not my father\'s son so he never related to him, and he\'s gay. He is incredibly accomplished in life, made it out of the Bronx, and is a marketing executive who has a really nice studio apartment in Brooklyn. I want to be where he\'s at in life and he loves me and my mom, but it\'s always been at a distance because he\'s always felt pressured to support our family since he\'s the one ""who made it."" He sees me as his immature kid brother--which is fair because I\'ve gotten into a lot of shit into the years and still don\'t have my shit together. I feel like it\'s hard to open up to him without judgement--and he\'s very jaded about our family since he grew up having no trust towards my father, being well aware of my mom being manipulated by my dad, being cast out of the extended family for being gay, and surviving as a gay man in the Bronx. I always feel like we could have an incredible sibling relationship but there\'s a lot of family trauma. Also I was a homophobic little shit up until I found out my best friend is bi.\n\nMy only friend up until college was my cousin, who happens to be bisexual, and we always had fun growing up enjoying a shared love of storytelling. Any scifi-movie with a bad-ass female protagonist was our jam, doing karoake to sugary pop music, or roleplaying scenarios in videogames (we\'d make our own machinimas in like smash brothers for example). My cousin was also way more social than me, so he\'d drag me kicking and screaming to any parties or group events and was basically my social lifeline. He\'s helped me through a lot of rough times, which has put a strain on our relationship.\n\nMy family has always been poor and dysfunctional. We\'ve been through alot--and lately I\'ve been feeling really insecure about my dreams and one day making it out of the hood. It almost feels impossible at times.\n\nShout out to any New Yorkers out here who know the struggle.\n\n\\[TLDR; Life Goes to shit &amp; Transition Thoughts\\]\n\nAfter dropping out of private college, being out of school for a year, and attending community college--things were incredibly tense at home with my family. My brother moved out and made his life--and my neighborhood and our financial debt at home just got worse and worse. My father got increasingly irritated about living in the Bronx, would call me his failure son, and be very mean to my mom. He worked very long hours as a bus driver, and I wasn\'t contributing to any bills at the time. I found escape in my community college\'s film club and writing classes--but made a mistake that cost me a year of my life.\n\nOne night I was drunk, depressed, and frustrated. I had lost a piece of camera equipment I couldn\'t afford to pay off at school, and my hours were getting cut at the restaurant I worked at because I kept dropping food due to my poor motor skills. I came home to my father yelling at me about closing the bathroom door too hard. I told him to go fuck himself, and he woke up and hit me in the face. We got into a very violent fight, he put an order of protection on me, and I officially had my first record every for third degree assault.\n\nThis violent outburst is very unlike me--I haven\'t gotten into a fight since high school. My brother had to bail me out of jail and get me a lawyer to clear my case, while I navigated finding a job and passing my classes all at the same time. I crashed on my cousin\'s bedroom floor in secret from my aunt, and ate the spare food at the restaurant I worked at (where I was on the verge of getting fired for my poor performance). Eventually I did get fired, and ended up finding a place to stay permanently in a really shitty room in an overcrowded house with an Ecuadorian family I found on Roomi in a bad neighborhood in Queens where there was no credit check, and paid the landlady through CashApp. No kitchen use allowed, and my landlady and her family were borderline insane. My brother spotted my first month\'s rent while I found a job, which was damn near impossible with my record. Eventually I did get my job at T-Mobile, through a photography friend I had made from one of my film activities. While they saw my record, I fought tooth and nail with several recommendations from previous employers to dispute why I should be able to work there. It took nearly 2 months and several rounds of interviews to go through the HR Process to get the job.\n\nMeanwhile, any day I wasn\'t looking for a job I was going to a community center for LGBT youth to get free meals, and giving my all to my film classes. I made a friend in my film professor, who is the sweetest man I\'ve ever met and the only positive male role model I\'ve ever had in life.  He showed me it was possible to be a 40 year old male and be a total nerdy kidult goofball while having a professional job and being role model to your community. That there were alternatives to being this hardened, macho, sexist, self-serious man my father and all my uncles were. If I were to stay male--I\'d want to be like him. I opened up to him about my situation, and he helped me with my court case to clear my misdemeanor, helped me pass my classes, and encouraged me to keep going to the campus film club. At the end of the semester--while I was still jobless and struggling to eat--he encouraged me to make a film about my disability for a film festival.\n\n I won a $500 scholarship to pay rent with, and was then offered by my professor along with 10 other art students to go to a summer art camp for 10 days which was the happiest week of my entire life. Words couldn\'t describe how great it was to be in nature (I\'ve never had that coming from the Bronx), and being with other creatives doing what I love. A lot of the students from that camp are still my friends to this day. We also learned a lot of great meditation exercises--and I now consider myself a Buddhist because of the experience.\n\nEverything worked out. I had a home (a shitty one where I was super uncomfortable--but I wasn\'t homeless), a job that was okay for my disability and paid the bills, and was still attending school. But things were still really hard. Not being able to see my mom sucked--and my impulsive and selfish actions ruined my relationships with my cousin and my brother. My summer camp friends ended up being the only friends I had--and my emotional baggage at the time proved difficult to discuss and alienated me a lot from them. I was depressed all the time and not fun to be around. \n\nIt got to a point where I was suicidal. I couldn\'t take coming to that home anymore to a similar scene I saw with my family--the landlady\'s daughter fighting with her boyfriend violently or having loud sex every night, annoying loud kids, my religious zealot landlady being OCD about the cleanliness of her house to the point where I felt dirty existing there, the overpriced rent and constant restrictions, not being able to use the kitchen and having no air conditioning during the summer or heating during the winter, and living in an absolutely filthy room I didn\'t have the energy to clean due to being exhausted from work and school.\n\nAround Christmas my brother was organizing me to see my mom at his house.

My Long ass story.... told in 4 parts.

\[MY BIO\]

 I'm a Dominican college student from the Bronx (23) who has an associates film degree from a community college. I love telling stories--whether that be writing plays for theater or making short films with my friends. My inspirations include Lin Manuel Miranda, Joss Whedon, &amp; The Wachowskis. I've always dreamed of being an artist as a career and living in NYC my whole life has made that dream so close to taste.

I still don't know if it's a weird hobby or who I really am and am TOTALLY unable to even entertain the idea because of how dangerous it is to be LGBT in the Bronx.

I'm just scared. And with COVID--god knows if I can even go upstate and explore who I am, let alone do the only thing I love in filmmaking.

I feel like a mindless automaton at work, and I feel like I will never escape the toxic masculinity of the world I am in.

I'm tired of this world. I know the world is so much bigger than the Bronx. So much brighter and more beautiful than I could even imagine. But I feel like I won't make it to see that day. To share my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening to my story. Noone's going to read like the 4 pages I've practically wrote here, but it feels good to release it to the internet.

I love telling stories--whether that be writing plays for theater or making short films with my friends. My inspirations include Lin Manuel Miranda, Joss Whedon, &amp; The Wachowskis. I\'ve always dreamed of being an artist as a career and living in NYC my whole life has made that dream so close to taste. I\'ve had so many cool opportunities at my community college--like being a PA for a documentary project at a big film festival, being apart of a playwright group with MFA students in their 30s (it felt weird being the youngest one there, lol), and making a short horror film with my friends at a summer camp. I began my journey at community college after dropping out of an insanely good private college where I got a full ride for engineering. My family was incredibly disappointed in me for dropping out--but I think the best thing that\'s ever happened to me was discovering film at my community college. I have really bad body dysmorphia ever since I was a child, and I also have a disability called developmental coordination disorder, so I really suck with my motor skills. Growing up I didn\'t have many normative childhood experiences due to always hating my body and being disabled. I sucked at sports, dancing, skateboarding, anything that required physical activity. I\'ve always struggled to come to terms with my adulthood and feel independent because of my disability--while longing for an adolescence I never got to fully have. Filmmaking is the only thing I\'ve ever found that has given me a voice and allowed me to have fun and explore my inner child.\n\n\\[FAMILY\\]\n\nMy best friend growing up was my mom--she was the breadwinner of our household and the first to go to a college. An amazing Dominican immigrant who worked hard to be the head of her department at CitiBank. When I was 12, she had a brain aneursym because of the stress of her job--and while she survived and had a very expensive surgery to be with us today--she\'s not the same person she was. She\'s very dependent on my father and me since she\'s mentally regressed to being part child/part adult. I love her to pieces but its\' always been hard to me accept that the strong women she was is gone. She resigns herself to staying indoors in our horrendous neighborhood where loud trap music is played on the streets all day, occasionally having run-ins with our drug abusing neighbors who harass her because of her disability, and generally not being able to do anything fun that she enjoys doing---like painting, going out to restaurant, or just even walking outside by herself. My mom is still incredibly intelligent after her incident and we can have these great elaborate conversations about our lives, telenovelas, art--and shes just so funny and full of life despite her condition. But I feel like the time we have together is dwindling, and our family will just never know life outside the Bronx. I always grew up wanting to be like my mom when she was a career woman. I idolized her.\n\nMy father is the exact opposite of everything I\'ve ever wanted to be. He\'s had a hard life being a campensino from the D.R.-and its a classic tale of toxic masculinity that I\'m sure you all know. My father warned me that ""I better not be gay"" when I was 8 because the other school kids were teasing me. But--he had no problem there. I\'ve always loved women. SO much. Infact--to this day, I still romanticize the idea of having a girlfriend. I\'ve not yet kissed anyone or had any romantic physical contact my entire life. I\'ve had opportunities--but body dysmorphia. ANYWHO...  my father was very abusive to me because of my disability. I always felt uncomfortable around him in any room. And I always felt like I had to be protective of my mother because her disability was way worse than mine. Constant yelling and calling me and my mom retards, constantly making us feel dependent on him and any chance to build up any independence was quickly put down. My father is a narcissist who forced his family to love him out of fear. Ultimately my relationship with my father ended very poorly because it led to me getting kicked out my house (read part 3!) ,but I eventually returned to my family to because of the COVID epidemic.\n\nMy brother is not my father\'s son so he never related to him, and he\'s gay. He is incredibly accomplished in life, made it out of the Bronx, and is a marketing executive who has a really nice studio apartment in Brooklyn. I want to be where he\'s at in life and he loves me and my mom, but it\'s always been at a distance because he\'s always felt pressured to support our family since he\'s the one ""who made it."" He sees me as his immature kid brother--which is fair because I\'ve gotten into a lot of shit into the years and still don\'t have my shit together. I feel like it\'s hard to open up to him without judgement--and he\'s very jaded about our family since he grew up having no trust towards my father, being well aware of my mom being manipulated by my dad, being cast out of the extended family for being gay, and surviving as a gay man in the Bronx. I always feel like we could have an incredible sibling relationship but there\'s a lot of family trauma. Also I was a homophobic little shit up until I found out my best friend is bi.\n\nMy only friend up until college was my cousin, who happens to be bisexual, and we always had fun growing up enjoying a shared love of storytelling. Any scifi-movie with a bad-ass female protagonist was our jam, doing karoake to sugary pop music, or roleplaying scenarios in videogames (we\'d make our own machinimas in like smash brothers for example). My cousin was also way more social than me, so he\'d drag me kicking and screaming to any parties or group events and was basically my social lifeline. He\'s helped me through a lot of rough times, which has put a strain on our relationship.\n\nMy family has always been poor and dysfunctional. We\'ve been through alot--and lately I\'ve been feeling really insecure about my dreams and one day making it out of the hood. It almost feels impossible at times.\n\nShout out to any New Yorkers out here who know the struggle.\n\n\\[TLDR; Life Goes to shit &amp; Transition Thoughts\\]\n\nAfter dropping out of private college, being out of school for a year, and attending community college--things were incredibly tense at home with my family. My brother moved out and made his life--and my neighborhood and our financial debt at home just got worse and worse. My father got increasingly irritated about living in the Bronx, would call me his failure son, and be very mean to my mom. He worked very long hours as a bus driver, and I wasn\'t contributing to any bills at the time. I found escape in my community college\'s film club and writing classes--but made a mistake that cost me a year of my life.\n\nOne night I was drunk, depressed, and frustrated. I had lost a piece of camera equipment I couldn\'t afford to pay off at school, and my hours were getting cut at the restaurant I worked at because I kept dropping food due to my poor motor skills. I came home to my father yelling at me about closing the bathroom door too hard. I told him to go fuck himself, and he woke up and hit me in the face. We got into a very violent fight, he put an order of protection on me, and I officially had my first record every for third degree assault.\n\nThis violent outburst is very unlike me--I haven\'t gotten into a fight since high school. My brother had to bail me out of jail and get me a lawyer to clear my case, while I navigated finding a job and passing my classes all at the same time. I crashed on my cousin\'s bedroom floor in secret from my aunt, and ate the spare food at the restaurant I worked at (where I was on the verge of getting fired for my poor performance). Eventually I did get fired, and ended up finding a place to stay permanently in a really shitty room in an overcrowded house with an Ecuadorian family I found on Roomi in a bad neighborhood in Queens where there was no credit check, and paid the landlady through CashApp. No kitchen use allowed, and my landlady and her family were borderline insane. My brother spotted my first month\'s rent while I found a job, which was damn near impossible with my record. Eventually I did get my job at T-Mobile, through a photography friend I had made from one of my film activities. While they saw my record, I fought tooth and nail with several recommendations from previous employers to dispute why I should be able to work there. It took nearly 2 months and several rounds of interviews to go through the HR Process to get the job.\n\nMeanwhile, any day I wasn\'t looking for a job I was going to a community center for LGBT youth to get free meals, and giving my all to my film classes. I made a friend in my film professor, who is the sweetest man I\'ve ever met and the only positive male role model I\'ve ever had in life.  He showed me it was possible to be a 40 year old male and be a total nerdy kidult goofball while having a professional job and being role model to your community. That there were alternatives to being this hardened, macho, sexist, self-serious man my father and all my uncles were. If I were to stay male--I\'d want to be like him. I opened up to him about my situation, and he helped me with my court case to clear my misdemeanor, helped me pass my classes, and encouraged me to keep going to the campus film club. At the end of the semester--while I was still jobless and struggling to eat--he encouraged me to make a film about my disability for a film festival.\n\n I won a $500 scholarship to pay rent with, and was then offered by my professor along with 10 other art students to go to a summer art camp for 10 days which was the happiest week of my entire life. Words couldn\'t describe how great it was to be in nature (I\'ve never had that coming from the Bronx), and being with other creatives doing what I love. A lot of the students from that camp are still my friends to this day. We also learned a lot of great meditation exercises--and I now consider myself a Buddhist because of the experience.\n\nEverything worked out. I had a home (a shitty one where I was super uncomfortable--but I wasn\'t homeless), a job that was okay for my disability and paid the bills, and was still attending school. But things were still really hard. Not being able to see my mom sucked--and my impulsive and selfish actions ruined my relationships with my cousin and my brother. My summer camp friends ended up being the only friends I had--and my emotional baggage at the time proved difficult to discuss and alienated me a lot from them. I was depressed all the time and not fun to be around. \n\nIt got to a point where I was suicidal. I couldn\'t take coming to that home anymore to a similar scene I saw with my family--the landlady\'s daughter fighting with her boyfriend violently or having loud sex every night, annoying loud kids, my religious zealot landlady being OCD about the cleanliness of her house to the point where I felt dirty existing there, the overpriced rent and constant restrictions, not being able to use the kitchen and having no air conditioning during the summer or heating during the winter, and living in an absolutely filthy room I didn\'t have the energy to clean due to being exhausted from work and school.\n\nAround Christmas my brother was organizing me to see my mom at his house. He was proud I was still in school and wanted us three to spend time together. But--I really wanted to end it all the day before. I was considering popping sleeping pills and alcohol until I wouldn\'t wake up. But then something came over me--to get out the house. To do anything but be there. \n\nI went to an H&amp;M and crossdressed for the first time December 23rd, 2019. I didn\'t feel euphoric--just incomplete. And curious. Two days later, on the 25th, I saw my mom and my brother together for the first time in months. I was happy--but my world was rocked my this discovery and it fueled more self-hatred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.....\n\n\\[EPILOGUE\\]\n\nJune 2020 I\'m living with my parents in the Bronx again. I moved back in March after asking permission to my dad to come back because of COVID. He has changed alot--and is realizing his mistakes and his old age. I still don\'t feel like I can trust him completely and probably never will--but it was the right decision to come back and be able to hug my mom again. I still have my job at T-Mobile, and have 1 class left to graduate my community college. I\'m applied to go upstate to school to an LGBT friendly SUNY to be free and queer for the first time ever.\n\nEvery single day I think about cross-dressing and transitioning, and feel guilty that it is not safe to do so in my neighbourhood, at my job, or because of the circumstances I\'m surrounded by living in the Bronx. I feel trapped and suffocated--like I can\'t be me. The only escape I have is watching Bianca (MJ RODRIGUES IS AN ICON!!!) on POSE and identifying with her story.\n\nBut I\'m not even sure its what I want? I\'d dread losing the safety and security of being a man and I don\'t want to kill off who I\'ve been the past 23 years. He was going to be a great dude and father one day. I\'m just so confused.\n\nI\'m safer, happier, and healthier, than I was last year--and have definitely made a lot of progress towards adulthood. But I feel like being feminine, or the desire to be the person my mom once was--IS WRONG.  I still have this constant tug of war of wanting to stay a man versus wanting to become a woman--mainly because of the context of how I grew up and how I know my community will just not accept me. How I\'m tired of being in poverty and desperately want better for myself and my family. Being trans feels like another setback. Like I have to startover again like when I stupidly blew my opportunity at the private school I went to. I still don\'t know if it\'s a weird hobby or who I really am and am TOTALLY unable to even entertain the idea because of how dangerous it is to be LGBT in the Bronx.\n\nI\'m just scared. And with COVID--god knows if I can even go upstate and explore who I am, let alone do the only thing I love in filmmaking.\n\nI feel like a mindless automaton at work, and I feel like I will never escape the toxic masculinity of the world I am in.\n\nI\'m tired of this world.

2020-07-01 14:46:32,hjblim,0,1,"I finally have a chance (maybe the only chance I‚Äôll get) to live the life I want, but I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll ruin it.

Hey everyone, I hope that each and every one of you are doing well :)

So in the Fall of 2020, I (20MtF) will be going to the school of my dreams, along with the major I‚Äôve strived for since the 1st Grade, and will finish my transition there and hopefully attend as a female student the next year.

The thing is when I graduated at 18, I had the same opportunity and more, and I threw it all away. I was heading to a top five D1 School for track, full ride with not just athletic but academic scholarships as well, things I‚Äôve worked for the entirety of my school career. I had a beautiful girlfriend, a sponsorship from Adidas, I even got a mini-parade from my little town. I‚Äôm living the dream right? Wrong. Dead wrong.

Ever since my parents found out I was transgender, they‚Äôve done everything they could to get rid of what they called my ‚Äúdisease‚Äù. I tried my best to make them and everyone around me happy I would wake up and tell myself that I‚Äôm wrong, and should be the ‚Äúman‚Äù I‚Äôm supposed to be. When college started everything fell apart. I started locking myself in my dorm, falling deeper into my depression, and if I wasn‚Äôt doing that I‚Äôd be out partying getting absolutely wasted to where I can‚Äôt think or feel anything at all, the only time I can feel a bit of peace. I was spiraling downward and hit the bottom. Hard. When you‚Äôre hurting inside so much but can‚Äôt do anything about it, you‚Äôll do anything to try to distract yourself from the pain. 

And unfortunately sometimes you do very desperate things.

And that landed me right in a psychiatric hospital. The next year gave me lots of time to think about who I am and what I want to do with my life, and it‚Äôs the same thing I‚Äôve wanted since a kid. I‚Äôve known I was transgender my whole life since my earliest memory. I know I didn‚Äôt belong here but tried my best to live the life that was set up for me. In a last ditch effort to go after the life I wanted, I applied to my dream school with quite a low acceptance rate and maybe lady luck was on my side because I got accepted!!

That was a year ago. I don‚Äôt know why but I absolutely loved the idea of destroying myself, I guess I hated my life that much, and did everything I could to screw it over. Somehow everything I could want aligned and now I have a shot to seize my dreams and aspirations. I used to be such a hard working student, but the depression really did a number on me. My mindset and mental state is perfect right now and I‚Äôm more motivated than ever. What I‚Äôm afraid of is that the self-sabotaging side of me might come out again, I‚Äôve been bottling everything up for over a decade and last year it reached the breaking point. how can I be sure it‚Äôs over? that I won‚Äôt fall into a depression again? I‚Äôm still in awe of everything somehow falling together to give me this opportunity, I‚Äôve never had any true motivation in my life until now, I‚Äôm scared this ambition might end, and I‚Äôll just get back to ruining my life. 

Whatever advice, book, movies, anything you think could help is extremely appreciated. I want to bounce back better than ever as the true me.

2020-07-01 17:31:16,hjetgr,4,1,"Hello, everybody!

I'm a cis dude with a knack for inventing things, and recently I've been spending a good bit of time on this sub.  During that time, I've noticed that- at least in some folks' cases- clothing can help mitigate or eliminate one's body dysphoria.  I've also seen that a lot of closeted trans people, and trans men in particular, wish that they had access to items like that so they could ease their own dysphoria, but can't purchase them explicitly without outing themselves.  

I'm looking to help with that, by creating a set of clothes that at a glance appear entirely normal, but are actually capable of performing some of the same functions.  Think of a 'stealth binder', for example; a garment that looks and is marketed as a sports bra, but can be adjusted to the point where it acts as a safe, incognito chest binder that can be released at the touch of a button in emergencies like someone you're not out to running around the corner.  

I'm making this post to ask for a bit of help.  I've done some research, but I still don't have what I deem to be a good understanding of what dysphoria is, how it manifests, and how I can help y'all fight it without having to come out of the closet.  If you're willing to answer a few questions on your experience with dysphoria, or you have suggestions for other 'stealth solutions', or even if you've just got a good resource on dysphoria, please, comment here or DM me!

Well, to my surprise, the girl I‚Äôm with now, couldn‚Äôt be more loving, and supportive, and just such a great person all around! She‚Äôs still struggling with the fact that I‚Äôm not the man she fell in love with, but she couldn‚Äôt be more excited to love the woman I truly am! In the past 4 days, she‚Äôs taken me shopping for my first pairs of panties, and tights. She even gave me a few things from her wardrobe! 

Today I completely shaved my body, and couldn‚Äôt be happier FINALLY living as my true self. 

Tomorrow I have an appointment with my GP, and will hopefully come out with an official gender dysphoria diagnosis, and a prescription to start HRT!

Hello all, my name is Louis Lindley and I am a queer trans man and a researcher with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am posting this survey on behalf of a queer cis woman in our research lab who has been a member of the[ Trans Research Lab ](https://trl.education.wisc.edu/)for 8 years and this study was developed with the support of the Trans Research Lab. Without outing anyone, I will say that many people in the lab are members of the trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming (TNG) community. The producer of the survey also collaborated with members of the [Wisconsin Trans Health Coalition](https://witranshealth.org/) and [FORGE Wisconsin](https://forge-wi.org/about/) (a national transgender anti-violence organization) in developing the study.

The Trans Research Lab is a social justice-driven lab conducting research that affirms the experiences of TNG and gender diverse individuals. Through a critical lens, our work aims to meaningfully transform and advance the position of TNG and gender diverse issues within the field of psychology.

Some FAQs about the survey:

* How were trans folks involved in development of this survey?
   * Trans folks were involved in the development of this study in multiple ways:
      * identifying the body-related construct of interest that we hope to measure
      * generating items for the new measure
      * focus groups to review the items of the new measure and provide feedback
      * consultation from trans professionals about the new measure
      * Additionally, whenever possible, we used measures in our survey that were designed by and for trans individuals and that de-pathologized trans identities
* What is the specific objective of the study and its intended impact on future trans lives?
   * The objective of this study is to develop and validate a new measure of how TNG individuals experience their body. We aim to create a new measure that captures nuance in TNG body experiences (e.g., we are creating a measure that does not pathologize how people relate to their bodies and is not reliant on gender dysphoria diagnostic criteria).
* Who is funding the study? Describe any conflicts of interest.
   * This study is financially supported by the Baldwin Wisconsin Idea Endowment Seed Grant and the Virginia Horne Henry Fellowship. There are no conflicts of interest.
* Is there IRB/Ethics board approval? Describe ethical practices specific to trans subjects.
   * Yes, this study has been approved by the UW-Madison IRB. Ethical practices specific to trans participants include not recording any identifying information, using trans-affirmative language throughout, using measures in the survey that are trans-affirmative, and offering compensation of $100 to every 20th participant.
* What is the target study population? Describe geographic scope, languages, and intersectional inclusion.
   * The target study population is any English-speaking adult who identifies as TNG. The survey is open to anyone with internet access regardless of geographic location. Regarding intersectional inclusion, this study is intentionally recruiting trans folks who identify along gender binary (e.g., transfeminine of center, trans woman, transmasculine of center, trans man, etc.) as well as individuals who are nonbinary, genderqueer, bigender, multigender, etc. This study has had an intersectional focus since its proposal, with Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw's work on intersectionality being cited throughout from its inception. We are intentionally recruiting from community-level organizations and groups, because so much research with TNG participants recruits from academic places (e.g., students, etc.)
* Is there a cost or travel requirement, or is there compensation for participants?
   * There is no cost or travel requirement. This study just asks participants to complete an online survey from their home, the library, work, etc. Every 20th participant will be compensated $100 until we reach approximately 300 participants.

There are no conflicts of interest.\n* Is there IRB/Ethics board approval? Describe ethical practices specific to trans subjects.\n   * Yes, this study has been approved by the UW-Madison IRB. Ethical practices specific to trans participants include not recording any identifying information, using trans-affirmative language throughout, using measures in the survey that are trans-affirmative, and offering compensation of $100 to every 20th participant.\n* What is the target study population? Describe geographic scope, languages, and intersectional inclusion.\n   * The target study population is any English-speaking adult who identifies as TNG. The survey is open to anyone with internet access regardless of geographic location. Regarding intersectional inclusion, this study is intentionally recruiting trans folks who identify along gender binary (e.g., transfeminine of center, trans woman, transmasculine of center, trans man, etc.) as well as individuals who are nonbinary, genderqueer, bigender, multigender, etc. This study has had an intersectional focus since its proposal, with Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw's work on intersectionality being cited throughout from its inception. We are intentionally recruiting from community-level organizations and groups, because so much research with TNG participants recruits from academic places (e.g., students, etc.)\n* Is there a cost or travel requirement, or is there compensation for participants?\n   * There is no cost or travel requirement. This study just asks participants to complete an online survey from their home, the library, work, etc. Every 20th participant will be compensated $100 until we reach approximately 300 participants.\n\nIf you would like to participate please follow this link: [https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_8v48USA6V9kMgrX](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8v48USA6V9kMgrX)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd7fvs5lqb851.png?width=2550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f68ce78e27e955829c3e636cabde5ee8bc81a179"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Trans Affirmative Body Experiences Survey ($$$)', 'created': 1593668639.0}"

If you didn‚Äôt know, taking estrogen while smoking can lead to numerous health effects, many that can result in death (heart attacks, strokes, etc). No Endocronologist would prescribe estrogen to a smoker.

So I‚Äôm 31 MtF and starting ‚Äòmones next week for the first time. 

This will be the fourth time I‚Äôve tried to take this particular leap, but I‚Äôm determined for it to be the last. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm left with a lot of swirling questions, one of them revolving around facial hair. 

So, even now - I am ‚Äúfollicularly challenged‚Äù I‚Äôve never been able to grow a beard or much body hair. Even if I completely let my facial hair ‚Äúgo‚Äù it takes WEEKS before I have any kind of noticeable shadow. 

In trying to get my ducks in a row for my transition I‚Äôve been wondering about what my options are for hair removal. 

Given that I don‚Äôt grow much as it is - is there reason to believe I may not be able to get permanent hair removal? Like, if I can‚Äôt grow a beard for them to remove, and to my understanding it‚Äôs easier/better if removal isn‚Äôt done super close to the skin - am I out of luck? 

Of the two things I‚Äôm most worried about (the other being my ‚Äúpronounced‚Äù brow bone) this one is definitely the bigger puzzle.

 My trust issues are thanks to my mom and stepdad (preacher) who both are highly homophobic and hate trans people even more, mainly because they‚Äôre very religious and closed minded.

I feel like shit because I‚Äôm to scared to tell my SO when I know they would support me and still love me.

2020-07-03 17:50:34,hknlgw,1,8,"1 year ago today, at 9:00 AM, escorted by my good friend Johnna, I walked into SPEKTRUM Health and from that moment, my life was forever changed. It was there that I met my personal hero and best friend ever and so many other countless people whom I am proud to have in my life. That was also the first also the first day that I started hormones. I don‚Äôt view this as a day to celebrate my own authenticity. I don‚Äôt view this as a day to celebrate my own achievements. I view this as a day to celebrate fate bringing me together with the people who give my life meaning and purpose. I view this as a day to celebrate the friendships I‚Äôve made with the people that inspire me to be my best self. Today is a day that I celebrate true and genuine happiness.

When I first came to Florida, I had nothing. I had my clothes and about $300 to my name. I had been living in Idaho for about the last six years, miserable and alone. Nobody truly knew me, not even myself. I was in a 13 year relationship that left me feeling hollow and empty. I loved her dearly but in my heart, I knew she didn‚Äôt truly love me. Instead of helping me after my suicide attempt the day after my 30th birthday, she shut me out of her heart forever. When I finally mustered the courage to share my truth with her, she kicked me out and said she couldn‚Äôt love me as a woman. I was broken. I felt as though I had made the biggest mistake of my life. I tried so hard to tell her that if it meant losing her, I wouldn‚Äôt transition. I was willing to endure the lies and manipulation because I didn‚Äôt feel like I was worthy of love. This was the same girl who, in a drunken Xanax induced stupor, told me that she had lied about having a dire medical condition to avoid being intimate with me. I was so blind but such is love. 

In the end, my willful ignorance cost me. She sent me away, blocked me from her life, and stole every possession I had. Alone, broken, destitute, I moved across the country with my mother to continue my journey. It was a long and difficult struggle to find work. I was turned away from countless positions until at last, Spektrum Health, Inc took a chance on hiring me as a part time receptionist. I was thrilled beyond words. 

Today I‚Äôm proud of who I am. I‚Äôm proud to be a transgender woman. I‚Äôm proud to be managing the single best LGBTQA+ clinic in the world. I‚Äôm proud to be a part of providing a truly better health experience to people across the country. I‚Äôm proud to be part of a movement that provides access to care for transgender people who struggle to find it. Finally, for those of you who are part of the SPEKTRUM family, I‚Äôm proud to be part of your life, to be part of your journey. As you make your way through whatever struggles present themselves in your transition, know that I am here with you on that same journey. I will always fight for you. I will always be ready to do anything to ease your burden because I too have endured such pain. We are family, you and I. Though we may never have met in person, I hold nothing but love and pride in my heart for you. No, today is not about me. Today is about you. Today is about your support for a mission which means everything to countless lives. Today is a day to celebrate you, my family, my friends, my fellow dream-builders. Today is a day to celebrate our combined efforts to change the world in the name of hope, justice, and equality.

While I want to give it more time before I make big decisions about changing how I am I am still planning and thinking of it for when the time comes but when I think about it I feel anxiety and fear. I'm scared that if I go through with it and go through the HRT process I won't get the results I want and I'll still be upset with how I look. I see all the amazingly beautiful people here and I feel both happy for them and envious of them. I want what you guys have and I want to try and trust the process but I'm scared I won't achieve a look I want or won't be feminine enough or pretty enough and it is a massive deterrent to the whole thing. As I am now I hate how I look and am quite disgusted with how I look and I don't want to go through the process and in the end not be the pretty girl I want to be. This thought brings up strong emotions and makes me want to cry when I think about going through the effort and in the end still hating how I am.

2020-07-04 23:38:39,hld0xg,1,2,"TLDR; I want top surgery eventually but thinking about my top that much makes me dysphoric, I probably won't like looking at my chest after surgery, and also surgery just scares me and makes me uncomfortable possibly to the point of passing out. Anybody had this and went through with it anyway or have other advice? 

--

I'm a NB afab and after finally getting a binder that wasn't awful, I gradually started wearing it more and more (though... less now with quarantine). I like having a flat chest and get dysphoric when it doesn't look flat through my clothes (as well as when I talk too much about it which may be evident in my roundabout way of talking...). Right now I feel like I could survive just binding when I can, but I know long term binding can cause health problems, and I think it's possible that I might get more dysphoric over time, which leads me to think that surgery would be a good idea. If I do get surgery, it probably won't be for at least a couple years. 

Unfortunately, I have a fear of surgery to begin with, but also, just thinking about my chest so much and the after care and the scars makes me dysphoric and I don't even feel like I'll be happy to see my flat bare chest afterwards as it seems to matter to me more when I'm wearing clothes. The advantage to me is that it'll be healthier and easier than wearing a binder. 

I also expect that I'll have an extremely difficult time taking care of the bandages and drains and cleaning and such afterwards. I once had a not particularly large mole removed and I came very close to passing out when I tried to clean it the first time, and couldn't clean it myself until it had started to heal more. I can't imagine how much harder it'll be for a procedure many many times bigger and probably grosser to deal with. I'm sure that having someone to help will make it easier but... well I do feel kind of bad about subjecting someone to that job and I'm certain it won't eliminate my discomfort and I think there's still definitely a chance I'll pass out.

So... Has anybody gone through something like this before? It's not a good idea to bind forever, right? Will I be better off to just grit my teeth and get it over with? Tips on how to manage this type of dysphoria??? I've been kind of trying to desensitize myself by thinking about it and watching videos on the topic, but I haven't heard much about this kind of problem and well... dysphoria is different from a fear of surgery and that part probably can't go away through exposure. So anyway, I was hoping someone had some insight to share. I'd really appreciate it.",trans,Want top surgery but it makes me dysphoric?

2020-07-05 04:38:01,hlgtm2,2,1,"Hi, I was hoping to get some advice on transitioning and also coming out. I just moved to San Antonio, TX a few months ago and was wondering how trans Healthcare is in the area and Texas and if I need to see a therapist to start HRT or for any surgery. I'm 21 and most of my life I haven't seen a doctor for anything because of my family and feeling like my family's health matters more then mine, yes ik it's stupid and trying to change that mindset but I just got use to the thinking that I'm the least importantin my family. I do have blue cross blue shield which as far as I can tell is decent but can't find much on what they cover for trans Healthcare. I did see that planed parenthood does hrt and was wondering if i should go that route or find a primary care doctor? I have been questioning my sexual orientation since I was 12 but didn't even learn of or about the LGBT community and trans people till I was 16. Since I was 13 I privately tried on more feminine close and came out to my 2 friends when I was 17 or 18. Since then I have came out to 3 other friends and last month my roommate and I went clothes shopping and I've been wearing more feminine clothes around our apartment.

I just moved to San Antonio, TX a few months ago and was wondering how trans Healthcare is in the area and Texas and if I need to see a therapist to start HRT or for any surgery. I'm 21 and most of my life I haven't seen a doctor for anything because of my family and feeling like my family's health matters more then mine, yes ik it's stupid and trying to change that mindset but I just got use to the thinking that I'm the least importantin my family. I do have blue cross blue shield which as far as I can tell is decent but can't find much on what they cover for trans Healthcare. I did see that planed parenthood does hrt and was wondering if i should go that route or find a primary care doctor? I have been questioning my sexual orientation since I was 12 but didn't even learn of or about the LGBT community and trans people till I was 16. Since I was 13 I privately tried on more feminine close and came out to my 2 friends when I was 17 or 18. Since then I have came out to 3 other friends and last month my roommate and I went clothes shopping and I've been wearing more feminine clothes around our apartment.

We have two options that are both so flawed, the only thing they both can give you is standing to pee
Penetrative sex is not as successful as cis couples with either option and you're likely to face alot of complications.

 phalloplasty you need to give up a chunk of skin thats going to cause it's own problems, and then you might not be able to feel anything(if you're not in pain), you cant get erections on your own, no sperm, and it takes more than one surgery just to LOOK like a cis dude without any bells and whistles.

Medioplasty is just as useless. You'll still have a micropenis too small for penetrative sex, you can pee standing but it's a weird looking mini dick thatd I'd be embarrassed to pull out anyway 

I'm amazed at medical science when I look at all they can do to give transwomen the most realistic, and effective gender confirmation surgery, to the point that in the next few years trans women are expected to be able to receive a transplanted womb and be able to bear children. 
But when you look at trans men, they still are looking at how to remove a penis for a transplant(very few successful removals of the organ, fewer successful transplants on Cismen with genital trauma) let alone attaching them to AFABs, theres not even research into if this is a surgery that would be in high enough demand to justify the cost of the trials and research.
I know I'd jump at the chance to have a fully operational dick n balls, whether or not it came from a dead guy.

2) It was getting retweeted by people who don‚Äôt seem to support trans individuals.  Definitely not my crowd.  

So I deleted the offending tweet and I feel bad for probably seeming to back up Rowling‚Äôs arguments even though it was attempt to point out challenges. I recognize why some people were upset (although some people were honestly being too toxic).

I‚Äôm a trans lad who used to be quite fond of Harry Potter. Alas, as consumption of it is not ethical, I shall instead restrain myself to going through Rowling‚Äôs utterly nonsensical essay and dismantling it‚Äôs chief arguments methodically.

For catharsis purposes of course. 

I tried to engage with her arguments in good faith but, well, that kind of fell apart because I grew increasingly frustrated with her not being willing to do the same. The research in this is pitiful, almost on par with an eighth grader. I‚Äôve seen better arguments and rhetoric from middle schoolers so it wasn‚Äôt really an intellectual pursuit. It was more of an exercise in my patience with this nonsense. It ran out about half way through.

There may be some typos, I did this in a rather delirious haze. Hopefully it won‚Äôt impact the comprehensibility on the whole but do be warned.

I figured this might be cathartic to other people as well, but if this will upset you or cause harm, please don‚Äôt read it.

Anyways here‚Äôs the disaster. It‚Äôs in pictures because Reddit wasn‚Äôt fond of the PDF

I‚Äôm Sam.\n\nI‚Äôm a trans lad who used to be quite fond of Harry Potter. Alas, as consumption of it is not ethical, I shall instead restrain myself to going through Rowling‚Äôs utterly nonsensical essay and dismantling it‚Äôs chief arguments methodically.\n\nFor catharsis purposes of course. \n\nI tried to engage with her arguments in good faith but, well, that kind of fell apart because I grew increasingly frustrated with her not being willing to do the same. The research in this is pitiful, almost on par with an eighth grader. I‚Äôve seen better arguments and rhetoric from middle schoolers so it wasn‚Äôt really an intellectual pursuit. It was more of an exercise in my patience with this nonsense. It ran out about half way through.\n\nThere may be some typos, I did this in a rather delirious haze. Hopefully it won‚Äôt impact the comprehensibility on the whole but do be warned.\n\nI figured this might be cathartic to other people as well, but if this will upset you or cause harm, please don‚Äôt read it.\n\nAnyways here‚Äôs the disaster.

2020-07-07 10:19:51,hmry3f,3,1,"I do think I have a specific case. I have been putting off this post for a long time (scared shitless to make an online post, something that's rare for me). I was going to put this on r/lgbt, but I just saw r/trans in my feed and suddenly got the determination to do this. Around two weeks into my school quarantine, almost 3-4 months ago now, (jesus), I had a mad dysphoria day as I ever so suddenly figured out I was trans. (I afterwards slowly realised that there had been a lots of little and big things that had led up to this revelation) I had a mad panic attack that night and I told a few friends the following morning. I love them and all, but they all just kinda said the same old thing, that they support me in whatever I choose and that they will still love me for the person I am/become. They all said I could go to them for advice or help, but some of them are online friends that just can't really physically help, even my real friends are just nudging me a long to come out, when I'm just so scared and I really don't have the balls. I did give some extra info to a friend though, saying that I was still into girls, and she just indentified me as straight-trans. I thought it had a pretty good ring to it and I've been using it ever since. (I'm not into other trans girls or trans guys, I feel like other then those, bi girls would be the only people who'd accept)  


To address some bracket thingies: 

* (jesus): We've kinda recovered down under here in Australia, although there is a current NSW/Vic border close starting from tonight, with over 3000 people in lockdown in 9 towers in Melbourne. People in my state have been going to school for almost 2 months now, holidays started 4 days ago :D
* (I afterwards slowly realised that there had been a lots of little and big things that had led up to this revelation): What I mean by this is, is that by looking back now, I see I had what some, would call girly behaviour in my early years of primary school. I'm sure my parents noticed, but they never said anything. I also nearly always pick female characters in video games, if that has anything to do with anything. Nearly all the online alias's I've ever used have had a girly name or touch. (along with girly anime pfp's)  


Now onto the real root, my parents.  
I tried to ask for a video game two years back and they said I had to make a tradeoff. Less computer time for this game. I just ended up saying nothing. I'm worried their going to do the same thing for my issue. Trading my physical sex for the amount of time I spend online. I don't think they're this evil, I'm just trying to get what's in my head down, they're really good people, I know they won't do that, I'm sure. This is where my case gets odd, my dad is a baby boomer and there is quite a sizeable language barrier with my mum. My dad just dosen't understand it sometimes, all of the LQBTQ+ stuff as a whole, he never gets it on the news when people say a specific one, he's just never bothered or put aside the time to learn the terms (I've educated myself quite a bit). He's not against it, he just really dosen't care for it, (example: when we had the vote for same sex marriage rights in AU, he just didn't vote, couldn't be stuffed. My grandma is cherrypick religious (she just picks out the good stuff from the bible, the happy quotes and not the magical stuff) and she voted yes! Not suprising really, she's a well meaning person.) I've always explained it's just a choice that people make, (or the way they were born, the messages are so mixed and controversial these days) and that that's what makes them happy. He tends to agree. There has been one case with him that really stuck out like a sore thumb to me and made me skew my view a bit. We were watching Two and a Half Men and at the end my sis said something related to the episode; ""I'm gay!"" and my dad responded chuckling, ""You better not be!"". I'm probably overthinking it but I got a bit worried after that one, even though it was before I figured out I was trans.  


Now onto my mother...  
I'm honestly just worried about the language barrier with her and overal, how I'm going to expalin what I am to them both. Tempted just to write a letter, so I can get all my thoughts and explaining out and maybe go hide at a friends place for a few days (with my parents permission ofc, like maybe a sleepover or something). She has never said anything off at all and has always agreed with me on how it's just people's simple happiness.  


I'm also really worried about finances and money, although my friends have told me not to. I have heard from different and clashing sources that medibank (Aussie private health insurance) may or may not cover HRT and surgery.  


It's alright if you can't read all this, maybe come back to it cus there's really no way to sum it up, if you did make it all the way through, thank you. Sorry for any spelling mistakes or doubles spaces you find, my keyboard is fucked and while English is my only language, I some how suck at touch typing and speaking it.

I'm gonna give my current opinion on this trying to be as respectful as I can be, it's not my intention to invalidate anyone.

This is how I currently see it: Your gender is a collection of mental characteristics that make you wanna have a body that matches them. You are born with a gender. Boy, girl or any place in the ""inter-gender non binary spectrum"". Social stimuli e.g nurture only comes into play after birth. Femininity, masculinity or any form of expression is completely unrelated to your gender. Thus, feminine trans men. Not all trans people have dysphoria, some have just a little bit, some only have euphoria and others have very strong gender dysphoria.

I have come to understand that gender isn't a social construct because it develops in the womb and there aren't any social interaction there. However, the way you understand your gender does develop after birth since enbies go through many terms before they find the right one to represent their ""intergender"" location in the spectrum.

I don't know why this is but people have called out my believe that gender isn't a social construct and argue some of my beliefs are transphobic/transcum. So I wanted to hear it from trans people.

2020-07-07 23:30:58,hn5r1c,6,1,"So I had a coworker who I got along with great and we had a lot of amusing adventures in working together.  We weren't close friends, but after my coworker found another job and moved away we lost contact. We're still Facebook friends, but that's the extent of our relationship now.  I look back at our time working together fondly and anecdotes about working with my coworker will still come up in conversation from time to time.

My question is this.  When I worked with this person, they identified as a cis male with he/him pronouns.  After we lost contact, they came out as a trans woman and now use she/her pronouns.  I think it's wonderful and she's gorgeous in her pictures, so that's not the issue, never ever would be, but I'm confused about how to refer to them when telling stories about them.  Do I use the pronoun they prefer now, or the pronoun they used at the time of the story and the time I knew them, or do I just continue to use they/them (which is now my default when I don't know)?  

I want to respect her current pronouns, and it's easy when referring to her in the present tense.  But because I haven't seen them since they transitioned and changed their name, it is sometimes hard to reconcile them as the same person, even though they are.  The fact she's a trans woman now is not relevant to the stories I tell about the fun times we had working together, but because I remember them as a cis male it feels strange to refer to them as she/her, so I try to use they/them when recounting memories, but I sometimes slip back to saying he/him.  And do I use their old name, or their new name, even though I really only knew them by their old name and that was the name they had at the time or is that bad?  I'm just not sure what would be considered appropriate or if I'm overthinking this. I don't want to be inadvertently showing disrespect or accidentally saying something that could be harmful.

tl;dr When telling stories about someone who transitioned after I lost contact with them, do I use their current pronouns, even if that's not the pronouns they used at the time I knew them, or the pronouns they used at the time of the story?

**The Media in Question:**

One Piece (SPOILERS AHEAD) is the most popular manga in the world.  Over its the 22+ years its rapidly become one of the most-read comics of all time (approaching Batman and maybe even passing Superman one day, the only two all-time more-sold franchises).  It's so huge that its protagonist Luffy is an [official representative of the 2020 Tokyo olyimpics](https://tokyo2020shop.jp/contents/special_character_ver2).  With this sort of reach, the author Eichiro Oda has just introduced a trans character to a *huge* audience of readers across the globe in chapter 984 of this mostly-weekly series.

This is not at all the first LGBT character introduced in the story, but it the second in a year who's been revealed to be trans with any sort of delicacy.  Oda has, in the past, actually been more than a bit tone deaf on LGBT and other issues, so these revelations have felt like growth for him. And this instance has renewed my awareness of not insignificant portions of the One Pieces reddit fanbase that will insist on misgendering, if not out of malice or stubbornness, out of ignorance.

**The Characters, Their Reveals, and the Community Reaction:**

[Kikunojo](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kikunojo) \- Last July, it was revealed that this female-presenting character was AMAB. She does occasionally use (or have used about her) male pronouns when discussing her as part of a group of samurai who are otherwise (presumably) cismale.  Otherwise, she says she is a ""woman at heart,"" and both she and those who know her use feminine pronouns for her.  Consider identity becomes a bit messier for the audience when it is later revealed that a similarly-styled femme cisman is her older brother.

At the time, a respected member of the community called OharaLibrarianArtur who regularly analyzes and offers historical and textual context to the latest chapter [wrote briefly on this reveal](https://onepiecethenewworld.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/one-piece-chapter-948-5.png), but didn't say a ton.

(TW)

For anyone familiar with the anime community, this reveal led to the use of what I understand to be a slur, but at the very least insensitive: trap.  At the time, the typical lurker I am, I made an account and attempted to address some of these comments, but felt that I made no progress.  Of course, I could've linked [Natalie Wynn's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzhqJK3bg) on the matter during her peak deescalation-of-the-alt-right period a few months prior, but who would actually watch a 45min video shoved in their face by a rando in a reddit comments section?  Especially when I was met with multiple ""My trans friend doesn't think it's offensive!""

[Yamato](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Yamato) \- This newer character is the heir-apparent of the powerful antagonist of the story at this moment.  Given that he idolizes a man whom his father gruesomely executed 20 years prior, we do not know if his relationship with his father is necessarily ""good.""  However, despite his feminine features, his father and all his father's subordinates use male pronouns for him.  His reasoning for identifying as a man is that he claims to be that man he idolized, named Oden, and that because Oden was a man, he is a man.  For clarification, this touches on a theme in the series of ""inherited will"" wherein a significant character for the story will inherit a destiny left unfinished by someone (typically dead) in the past.  At this point, this has never been indicated to be any sort of reincarnation.  However, this identification as a specific man has complicated the authenticity of the male identity for much of the fanbase.

Threads [such as this](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/hn57yx/i_love_him_and_he_deserves_everything/) have been met with a wealth of highly-upvoted comments insisting on misgendering Yamato. This was just a piece of fan art, but the comments demonstrate a clearly divided community. In contrast, OharaLibrarianArtur again offered some [analysis of the reveal](https://onepiecethenewworld.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/one-piece-chapter-984-analysis-5.png), this time a bit more intentionally.

**Closing:**

In reaction to these sorts of divisive comment threads, I've felt the urge to do something.  Rather than unproductively calling out individually vocal nobodies in the comments section, I've thought maybe assembling a thoughtful post with discussion of gender and sex and some educational resources could be good.  But I also recognize I am not myself a part of this community, nor can I claim to be any sort of authority on these issues.  In fact, it took me years of actively trying to learn more just to get where I feel I know enough to know how little I know, to the point that I'm not even sure what I'd say or what educational resources I'd offer.

My sister did, which is why she is now my sister, but it never seemed to be something that would fit me. I'm pansexual, so I was already questioning my sexuality, but until recently, I never really thought about my pronouns or if I would rather be referred to with different ones.

1. First-hand accounts only, please. While accounts from allies about their friends can be enlightening in their own right, this is something that really is best explained by a person directly. Please understand this is just to make sure trans and nonbinary voices are heard.
2. Transition can include chemical, surgical, and/or social. All three of which are equally valid. If I am forgetting something, feel free to correct me!
3. If you have anything you want to add outside the direct parameters of the question, please feel welcome to. The idea is to enable better understanding and the best way to do that is through communication, is it not?
4. Finally, I ask that you include if you are trans or nonbinary. I want to make sure I keep the distinction in mind when going through experiences simply because some experiences for transfolk and enbies are different, even if there is a lot of overlap.

2020-07-08 23:49:29,hnsfmc,5,1,"So, for a while now I've been having some pretty bad dysphoria, and I'm not sure how to feel about it. To clarify, I've been identifying as androgynous for a while now, but am biologically male. Although, I've been having some trouble with the label androgynous, due to not liking pretty much anything masculine. For example, things like facial hair, body hair, and other body parts (Or lack of body parts), cause extreme dysphoria. And although I don't feel completely female, I still would possibly like to look into transitioning later on in life. 
This is where the confusion part comes in, because I'm not entirely sure if I'd like to transition fully, or just micro dose estrogen. Because I feel like if I transitioned fully, I still wouldn't completely conform to being female, but I also feel like a feminine body would help with my dysphoria. I'd like to stick to the labeling of androgynous, or maybe non binary, but with a female body, if that makes sense. 
So I'm just wondering if that would make me androgynous, or trans, or a mixture of both?

I‚Äôve had gender dysphoria for long as I can remember. According to my mother I used to toss coins in wishing wells and wish I was a boy. I‚Äôve always presented myself as much more masculine than feminine. I began to identify as bigender starting in college, because it was the first time I felt I could accept myself as male....as long as I was also female. Then I met my husband.

But now my dysphoria is getting worse, and I‚Äôm considering exploring my more masculine side.

I got top surgery today and it was the happiest day of my life. I could share my whole story and how it's been an eleven year internal and external battle with myself, my family, and addiction to get here but basically - I just had the happiest day of my life. 

  
My surgery day started with a video call from my best friend/chosen sib's parents who have adopted me since I lost fam.of.origin relationships a year ago. Surgery went well. My chosen family took care of me, after all getting covid test results back. I was fed and nurtured and given meds. My sponsees reached out to tell me they loved me. (I'm about to celebrate 2.5 years sober in 11 days.) My sponsor and her wife danced a happy dance for me when I let them know how I was. My phone and email were blown up by friends all over the US, old coworkers, old ladies from AA. One of my best friends did my t shot while my cousin took a kink questionnaire online and my sibling made themself a snack. They fed me homemade chicken soup, and tea, and oreos. We talked for a few hours about our lives, and skyped our chosen fam from far away. Everyone offered me a blessing for my new body - joy; congruence and clarity; enjoying being helped and loved; pride in how far I've come and sustainability in how I move into the future.  

  
Being taken care of is the part of surgery I've been the most afraid of, but today was the happiest day of my life. I have waited my whole life to be treated like this, and to give over control and be supported well.

For all my trans siblings who keep telling yourselves it is impossible or it won't happen or you'll die first or you don't deserve it or you should wait til your parents die, or any of the other 2,000 terrible things I told myself since I first learned what medical + social transition was, just take it easy and focus on being the same person in every room. My advice is to just focus on developing your character, your values, and your community. Because if you aren't ready to come out or transition, that's fine. Put the work in now so that you can live in line with your values and be intentional about handling and releasing internalized transphobia and homophobia. Later, no matter what you choose, you'll be grateful that you did. Your relationships will benefit and your soul will be lighter even if you're living with dysphoria or doubt or gender-fear. 

  
Whether you take hormones or have procedures done or change your name or not, you're a living human being who needs love and care and who is so much more than just your gender or just your secrets. Maybe I wasn't ready for top surgery or hormones 11 years ago. But I've done a lot of work, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and relationally to get to the place where I walked into surgery sober, calm, and smiling, and walked out free.

I could share my whole story and how it's been an eleven year internal and external battle with myself, my family, and addiction to get here but basically - I just had the happiest day of my life. \n\n  \nMy surgery day started with a video call from my best friend/chosen sib's parents who have adopted me since I lost fam.of.origin relationships a year ago. Surgery went well. My chosen family took care of me, after all getting covid test results back. I was fed and nurtured and given meds. My sponsees reached out to tell me they loved me. (I'm about to celebrate 2.5 years sober in 11 days.) My sponsor and her wife danced a happy dance for me when I let them know how I was. My phone and email were blown up by friends all over the US, old coworkers, old ladies from AA. One of my best friends did my t shot while my cousin took a kink questionnaire online and my sibling made themself a snack. They fed me homemade chicken soup, and tea, and oreos. We talked for a few hours about our lives, and skyped our chosen fam from far away. Everyone offered me a blessing for my new body - joy; congruence and clarity; enjoying being helped and loved; pride in how far I've come and sustainability in how I move into the future.  \n\n  \nBeing taken care of is the part of surgery I've been the most afraid of, but today was the happiest day of my life. I have waited my whole life to be treated like this, and to give over control and be supported well.\n\nFor all my trans siblings who keep telling yourselves it is impossible or it won't happen or you'll die first or you don't deserve it or you should wait til your parents die, or any of the other 2,000 terrible things I told myself since I first learned what medical + social transition was, just take it easy and focus on being the same person in every room. My advice is to just focus on developing your character, your values, and your community. Because if you aren't ready to come out or transition, that's fine. Put the work in now so that you can live in line with your values and be intentional about handling and releasing internalized transphobia and homophobia. Later, no matter what you choose, you'll be grateful that you did. Your relationships will benefit and your soul will be lighter even if you're living with dysphoria or doubt or gender-fear. \n\n  \nWhether you take hormones or have procedures done or change your name or not, you're a living human being who needs love and care and who is so much more than just your gender or just your secrets. Maybe I wasn't ready for top surgery or hormones 11 years ago. But I've done a lot of work, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and relationally to get to the place where I walked into surgery sober, calm, and smiling, and walked out free. \n\nThank you for reading this and celebrating with me. Love to all.\n\nEmmett"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'happiest day of my life', 'created': 1594309010.0}"

2020-07-09 08:51:22,hnzpp9,0,1,"So, um, hi. I‚Äôm 22 born male, and over the past year I‚Äôve been taking a break from college. During this time I‚Äôve been thinking a LOT. About everything- what I really what to do with my life, do I want to go back to college, should I go to the dentist, etc. and recently I‚Äôve gotten to the bit where I question my gender and sexuality.

For the record, I know sexuality and gender are totally separate from one another, but they‚Äôre just similar enough to where my brain decided to tackle both at once, so here we are. 

I think I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm some type of queer on the sexual front because It‚Äôs not necessarily the machinery someone has the sparks an attraction. It‚Äôs tied more to their femininity, but I digress.

The real reason I‚Äôm here is because, right now, I kind of feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a gender limbo if that makes any sense. To preface, I‚Äôve never really felt uncomfortable in my gender, and never really felt some type of gender dysmorphia. It never really crossed my mind that I could be something different because I‚Äôve always been more focussed on other things i.e. school lol. But, now that I‚Äôm actually contemplating the idea of presenting myself as a female or at least in a more womanly fashion, I‚Äôve started to kind of get this giddy feeling like when I get when I‚Äôm about to perform onstage. It feels sort of like an anxious nervousness but not really in a bad way. When I imagine myself with breasts, I get a tight feeling in my chest and throat and I always end up thinking that it actually might be pretty fun to have them (and I don‚Äôt necessarily mean this in a sexual way.)

I‚Äôve also started having some dreams (both normal and ones centered around sex) where I‚Äôm a woman and, honestly, they always end up being really great. 

I‚Äôve been talking to a friend about all of this for the past few days, and she advise I go see a gender-affirming therapist (which I actually didn‚Äôt know existed even though it makes so much sense,) but I figured I would come here first and see what y‚Äôall have to say since asking for advice on reddit doesn‚Äôt cost $100+ lol.

I guess my main problem here is everywhere I look for information about being trans there‚Äôs always the mention of gender dysphoria which I‚Äôve never really felt, so I‚Äôm having trouble validating whether or not I‚Äôm trans or just extra adventurous I guess lol. I would be greatly appreciative of anyone who is willing to help me figure myself out.

2020-07-12 04:19:40,hpoamm,2,1,"So, I've been feeling trans for a good while now. Maybe since like October of last year. A massive disconnect between who I was and what I was.

Earlier this year (February, to be exact) I came out to the my parents as trans. I told them how I don't like being a boy and that I never felt like a boy and, understandably, an as expected, I broke down crying. I thought everything was fine then. I thought my parents would accept me. My parents checked up on me for the next few days thinking everything was fine. So, I would assume that it was all ok.

Last month, I came out to my sister. And basically the same thing happened. She suggested we started talking over text since that way I could get my words across because I was incomprehensible because of all the crying and hyperventilating that was happening. And, again, I thought everything was fine.

Really, nothing's fine. Earlier this year, I ordered a wig. My nosy youngest sister opened it up and showed my dad. He wasn't happened, he was shocked. He must have thought I was joking or just super confused when he saw it. And just last week, I finally ordered some socks under my new chosen name, 'Nika'. This time, he was the person to got the package and at dinner remarked about the 'funny name on it' to which I replied he 'better get used to it.'

A few nights ago, I put my Dad, my Mum and my sister into a group chat so I could talk to them all at once. I asked them if they could please refer to me by Nika and use she/her pronouns to refer to me. I said I understand that its not going to be an overnight process and may takes months to years to get used to and that I won't mind slip-ups, but to correct themselves. To keep it brief, I was met with ""you'll always be our son/brother"".

So yeah, I live with bigots, I guess. Is there any chance of me getting them to understand, or is my best bet to tolerate it and move out and cut ties at my earliest convenience?

A friend of mine is helping me recover from surgery in a week. They‚Äôve been extremely generous, letting me stay at their house for a few weeks and planning to drive me out to a different state for the actually surgery, and back. When we made these plans nearly a year ago, I feel like our friendship was in a totally different place. I didn‚Äôt realize it yet, but they had feelings for me (they confessed these a few months later, and nothing ended up happening. My feelings for them are and where mostly platonic, but we both recognized a certain level of sexual tension at one point. We agreed to keep things platonic though, and they told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my best friend in the world, and I would be very scared to mess that up‚Äù). Fast forward 6-7 more months, and I‚Äôm currently staying at their house, which they now share with their partner. Recently, I‚Äôve been sensing an air of resentment around the whole thing. It‚Äôs always caged in sarcasm or jokes, the kind that you know are partially true. The thing is, we are the type of friends who often give each other a hard time, so I feel like I could be overreacting, but at the same time, there‚Äôs been some kind of shift that I can‚Äôt quite place. They‚Äôre bossy, and act like my ideas and assumptions are laughable. They act surprised if I have a ‚Äúgood idea‚Äù aka one that they like. They kind of come off high and mighty when it comes to certain topics, but don‚Äôt want to hear it when I have some knowledge to share. 

All in all, it‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle. But I am starting to feel as though I want to pull away. I feel guilty about it, because I don‚Äôt want it to seem as though I ‚Äúused‚Äù them to help me recover, and don‚Äôt care about our friendship after this is done, but I really don‚Äôt feel the same way about our friendship as I used to, given their behavior.

The annoying thing is that when I started to sense some of this (a few weeks back), I let them know that there was someone else who‚Äôd also be willing to take care of me, if they had too much on their plate. But they said they were fine with doing it. Also, maybe this is just my insecurity talking, but it bothers me that our friendship seemed more valuable to them when they had feelings for me. I understand that they‚Äôre dating someone else and that person is probably their best friend in many ways, and that‚Äôs totally okay with me. But if they didn‚Äôt want to do this for me they could‚Äôve gotten out of it. I gave them that opportunity...

You'd get matched with someone approximately your size. Someone MTF can send someone FTM all of her old masculine clothing, and receive new feminine clothing from someone FTM. And vice-versa. Like a trade. 

Nobody would need to buy anything, and it would be a near guarantee that most if not all the clothes would fit. People wouldn't have to figure out what to do with a bunch of old clothes that don't fit their gender presentation, and wouldn't need to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe!

2020-07-14 04:27:54,hquvjf,4,1,"How does one even start a post like this? Well I'm hoping I can get some more information from people who have been through this transition in their lives, and maybe it'll give me the motivation to start down this path. A little background first:

I'm a 22 year old male who, since I can remember, have never felt comfortable with my own body. To begin with, I took comfort in my hair. Even as a child, I loved it long. Below my shoulders and beyond. Whenever I had to cut it, I would be very sad and always regretted it. This was sign number one. 

Eventually, I was able to forget how much I disliked living in my shell and used my parent's religion to convince myself I was the way I was supposed to be. I'm aware this can be a very toxic way of thinking, but I was brainwashed in church so yea. Then I opened myself up to being more feminine. While I never really liked acting girlish, I did feel more comfortable when I viewed myself as female. At first, I thought this was a sexual thing. After all, I was cursed with a high libido and low self esteem. But I eventually found a balance between just being who I am and acting more how I want to be. So far, aside from my incessant facial hair growth and face structure, I could almost pass as female sometimes. This was sign number two. 

More recently, I've given this some very serious thought. I interrogated myself as to why I want to be a female. Is it for the sex like it so often feels like? Is it because I want to be able to love who I see in the mirror? Is it because I crave the attention and love I get from others when I act as a female online? Well it's a mix of those three and plenty of other reasons. When I see myself as female, I can't help but smile. I can't help but want to show off. When I take a particularly flattering photo that makes me look a bit girly and a bit tomboyish, I want to show it off. When I imagine myself as a female, I want to perfect myself. I get the desire to take care of my body. I feel motivated to exercise and eat right. All the things I don't have when I look at myself in the mirror now. This was sign number three. 

The things that are holding me back are my family, my finances, and where I live. As you could probably guess, I live in a conservative Christian home, in poverty, and smack dab in the middle of the Bible Belt. It's hard enough finding people who are open minded to talk to about this, but it's even harder to find professionals who won't quote bible verses and pretend that an invisible sky daddy will cure all sicknesses. If you're not sure where this post is going, neither am I honestly. This is partially a manifesto of everything I'm afraid to say to people I know, and a cry for help. There are a few questions I would like answered, but I think I'm mostly looking for people who can understand what I'm going through and make some sense of it for me. Onto my questions though. 

1: Where should I start? Should I wait until a regular check-up to ask about this stuff? Should I try to find a professional to talk about this and maybe determine whether or not a transition is the best course of action? My GP doctor is great and she's very open minded. In fact, I'm certain that even though I never told her, she knows I suffer from depression and she always drops hints that it's okay and I can work through it.

2: What kinds if insurance would cover the treatments and surgeries related to a transition? I'm currently on the family plan from Medicare but only barely. My family doesn't qualify for anything else since we make just enough to be slightly covered, but not enough to have full coverage. And before you ask, yes we have applied for Charity Care. It doesn't help for stuff like this in my state. 

3: What questions did you ask yourself before you decided that a transition was right for you? I'm always in my head so being able to explore my psyche with direct questions instead of the chaos it's been so far would be incredibly helpful. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much and I'm really sorry for writing so much. I guess you've seen a little insight into my mind. Just add some random music and endless tangents and you know what my brain is like 24/7. I appreciate any help you guys can give me and I promise to keep considering my options.

After all, I was cursed with a high libido and low self esteem. But I eventually found a balance between just being who I am and acting more how I want to be. So far, aside from my incessant facial hair growth and face structure, I could almost pass as female sometimes. This was sign number two. \n\nMore recently, I've given this some very serious thought. I interrogated myself as to why I want to be a female. Is it for the sex like it so often feels like? Is it because I want to be able to love who I see in the mirror? Is it because I crave the attention and love I get from others when I act as a female online? Well it's a mix of those three and plenty of other reasons. When I see myself as female, I can't help but smile. I can't help but want to show off. When I take a particularly flattering photo that makes me look a bit girly and a bit tomboyish, I want to show it off. When I imagine myself as a female, I want to perfect myself. I get the desire to take care of my body. I feel motivated to exercise and eat right. All the things I don't have when I look at myself in the mirror now. This was sign number three. \n\nThe things that are holding me back are my family, my finances, and where I live. As you could probably guess, I live in a conservative Christian home, in poverty, and smack dab in the middle of the Bible Belt. It's hard enough finding people who are open minded to talk to about this, but it's even harder to find professionals who won't quote bible verses and pretend that an invisible sky daddy will cure all sicknesses. If you're not sure where this post is going, neither am I honestly. This is partially a manifesto of everything I'm afraid to say to people I know, and a cry for help. There are a few questions I would like answered, but I think I'm mostly looking for people who can understand what I'm going through and make some sense of it for me. Onto my questions though. \n\n1: Where should I start? Should I wait until a regular check-up to ask about this stuff? Should I try to find a professional to talk about this and maybe determine whether or not a transition is the best course of action? My GP doctor is great and she's very open minded. In fact, I'm certain that even though I never told her, she knows I suffer from depression and she always drops hints that it's okay and I can work through it.\n\n2: What kinds if insurance would cover the treatments and surgeries related to a transition? I'm currently on the family plan from Medicare but only barely. My family doesn't qualify for anything else since we make just enough to be slightly covered, but not enough to have full coverage. And before you ask, yes we have applied for Charity Care. It doesn't help for stuff like this in my state. \n\n3: What questions did you ask yourself before you decided that a transition was right for you? I'm always in my head so being able to explore my psyche with direct questions instead of the chaos it's been so far would be incredibly helpful. \n\nIf you've read this far, thank you so much and I'm really sorry for writing so much. I guess you've seen a little insight into my mind. Just add some random music and endless tangents and you know what my brain is like 24/7. I appreciate any help you guys can give me and I promise to keep considering my options. Thanks again for reading. :)"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Future MtF hopeful.', 'created': 1594726074.0}"

Would it be alright to say: ""(birthname) recently came out as trans, her new name is (new name)."" I feel bad about using her birthname and advice would be appreciated, thanks!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'help ;-;', 'created': 1594823390.0}"

2020-07-16 16:55:46,hsdb4m,13,1,"Hi, i kind of have developed a curiosity about this particular topic about : ""what makes a women a women?"".

I am a cisgender woman, and i have always thought being a woman in some way or another had to be related around your biological sex. However, by learning about trans culture i have realized that sex isnt the defining factor when it comes to being a ""woman"".

So, if we take out sex from the equation, what makes a woman a woman? In a society which is proudly breaking sterotypes and being more gender fluid, the definition about what makes a woman a woman starts to get blurry.

In the past (around 20 -30 years ago), being a woman was correlated to being femine, but we now live in a society that man wears makeup or is wearing a skirt doesnt mean that he is any less of a man. The same with women, her not shaving or not following a patriarchal vision of what a women is supposed to look like, doesnt mean she is any less of  a woman. Or even a transgender who is just starting their transition is still a woman, even though they have manlish features.

By this post i am in no way trying to be transphobic or deny trans existence, trans people are valid and choosing not to accept them is not an option. And i am sorry if this post offended you in any way, the main objective of this post is to learn and be a better human being and understand a community i am not part of.

So, i want to know, is there a defition on what makes a woman? what makes a man? is it just a social construct? is there any point of we trying to still define ourselfs with a ""gender"". I wish as many people as possible respond to this post, i just really want to learn.

2020-07-17 18:40:27,ht192p,20,1,"I was watching a Joe Rogan podcast last night and the topic of transgenderism came up and wow it got me thinking. 

This is a really hot button issue. 

Before I get into my ‚Äúhot take‚Äù on how government can protect people in the Transgender Community just know I have no malicious intent. 

I‚Äôm not here to degrade, or infringe upon ANYONE. 

I‚Äôm just a solution oriented person who see a issue in our society regarding the ones who are non conforming. 




Okay so here it goes.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
It all starts in Preschool and Kindergarten.

We teach kids the differences between Sex and Gender.

Sex is a hard science.

Gender is an idea 

Sex references to the physiological differences between people who are Xx and Xy.

Gender is social construct. It‚Äôs an idea that people have accepted as normal and obvious but it doesn‚Äôt represent objective reality. 


For all of human history there‚Äôs has only been two genders. Man and Women. 


But as society became more progressive, everyone realized that there are people who  feel that there Sex doesn‚Äôt align with their assigned gender role that society has given them. 

For example, a person can be born as a Male(Xy) but doesn‚Äôt identify as a Masculine  Man: strong, competitive, a natural born leader, doesn‚Äôt express emotion &amp; is great with women, etc etc. 


To account for this, society creates third gender: ‚ÄúGender X‚Äù. 

Gender X accounts for all of the different genders a person can be. Ranging from Transgender, Non-Binary, Agender, Non conforming and everything in between. 

With this frame-work in mind, this can solve all of the controversial issues surrounding this subject. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Federal Legislation

There will have to new laws created that protect individuals within the Gender X Community from discrimination and hate speech. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Bathrooms

In order for a building to get approve for construction it needs to have three bathrooms.

One for men

One for women 

And one for Gender X people.

-‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Academic Scholarships

scholarships that are gender oriented such as ‚ÄúWomen Engineering Scholarship‚Äù cannot be awarded to individuals in the Gender X Community on the basis of Trans-Women are apart of the Gender X, gender. 

Just how a Man cannot be awarded a Gender X Oriented Scholarship such as Trans-Women for STEM. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Sports Leagues

Because they are physiological differences between the Sexes, schools, colleges, and professional athletics will have to create a special league for those who identify within the Gender X Community.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Minors who identify as Gender X

if a minor believes they are non binary or bi-gender or transgender 

LetüëèThemüëèExpressüëèWhoüëèTheyüëèAreüëèAsüëè INDIVIDUALS. 

It‚Äôs really as simple as that.

On that same token though, let‚Äôs not disturb Minors physiologically though. 

No Testosterone, no Hormone Blockers, &amp; No Gender Reassignment Surgeries. 

On the basis of two things
- introducing steroids to a child/adolescent can have adverse physical and mental affects on human development  
- on the small chance that this minor wants to change there mind  (again) on which gender they are, they don‚Äôt have physical barriers stopping them. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Prisons

It‚Äôs an idea that people have accepted as normal and obvious but it doesn‚Äôt represent objective reality. \n\n\nFor all of human history there‚Äôs has only been two genders. Man and Women. \n\n\nBut as society became more progressive, everyone realized that there are people who  feel that there Sex doesn‚Äôt align with their assigned gender role that society has given them. \n\nFor example, a person can be born as a Male(Xy) but doesn‚Äôt identify as a Masculine  Man: strong, competitive, a natural born leader, doesn‚Äôt express emotion &amp; is great with women, etc etc. \n\n\nTo account for this, society creates third gender: ‚ÄúGender X‚Äù. \n\nGender X accounts for all of the different genders a person can be. Ranging from Transgender, Non-Binary, Agender, Non conforming and everything in between. \n\nWith this frame-work in mind, this can solve all of the controversial issues surrounding this subject. \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nFederal Legislation\n\nThere will have to new laws created that protect individuals within the Gender X Community from discrimination and hate speech. \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\nBathrooms\n\nIn order for a building to get approve for construction it needs to have three bathrooms.\n\nOne for men\n\nOne for women \n\nAnd one for Gender X people.\n\n-‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nAcademic Scholarships\n\nscholarships that are gender oriented such as ‚ÄúWomen Engineering Scholarship‚Äù cannot be awarded to individuals in the Gender X Community on the basis of Trans-Women are apart of the Gender X, gender. \n\nJust how a Man cannot be awarded a Gender X Oriented Scholarship such as Trans-Women for STEM. \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\nSports Leagues\n\nBecause they are physiological differences between the Sexes, schools, colleges, and professional athletics will have to create a special league for those who identify within the Gender X Community.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\nMinors who identify as Gender X\n\nif a minor believes they are non binary or bi-gender or transgender \n\nLetüëèThemüëèExpressüëèWhoüëèTheyüëèAreüëèAsüëè INDIVIDUALS. \n\nIt‚Äôs really as simple as that.\n\nOn that same token though, let‚Äôs not disturb Minors physiologically though. \n\nNo Testosterone, no Hormone Blockers, &amp; No Gender Reassignment Surgeries. \n\nOn the basis of two things\n- introducing steroids to a child/adolescent can have adverse physical and mental affects on human development  \n- on the small chance that this minor wants to change there mind  (again) on which gender they are, they don‚Äôt have physical barriers stopping them. \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\nPrisons \n\nAs a convicted felon, essentially all your rights are taken away.

Basically my mate came out to me as trans recently. Obviously I'm very happy for him.

I don't want to be pushy with him, just want to support him while he sets the pace. I don't know loads about the trans community so after a little bit of research on pre-existing sources, I said the next place to search would be here.

So anyway, yeah.

I guess it isn't unknown that Russia is quite a homophobic and trabsphobic country, and this bill will make it way worse.

Several days ago the bill that (among other things) bans, as stated above, transgender people from getting married and legally transitioning was introduced to the State Duma. It is being considered right now and it will be concidered during next several months, but this bill has really high chance to become a law.

In order to elaborate the statements about the bill, here's what it means:

1. Technically, it will be considered that transgender person's gender is assigned one, therefore, transgender person can't marry cisgender person of the opposite gender because it'll be 'same-sex marriage'. Trans person will probably have the opportunity to marry cis person of the same gender, because, according to the documents, transgender person's gender is assigned one.

2. Transgender people won't be able to get new birth certificate, passport and other documents. All transgender people that have already changed their documents will have to change them back. Medical transition will be allowed though.

3. Due to everything said above it will be very hard for trans people to adopt children. 

There's a petition to stop it, there probably will be protests but if there aren't enough people doing this, it won't change anything. So I guess it sounds like a cry for help and it pretty much is one. The more people know the more people can do something. I have already posted this on r/lgbt and I hope it is OK to post it here. 

I leave the link to petition and to the news article about it but it's all in Russian.

I have already posted this on r/lgbt and I hope it is OK to post it here. \n\nI leave the link to petition and to the news article about it but it's all in Russian. \n\n[Petition](https://www.change.org/p/%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82-%D0%BE-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%BC-%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%B4%D1%8F%D0%BC-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%B8-%D1%83%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_23469628_ru-RU%3A0&amp;recruiter=56920901&amp;recruited_by_id=28da1bf0-d210-0130-895a-3c764e04a19b&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial)\n\n[News Article](https://meduza.io/cards/transgendernym-lyudyam-hotyat-zapretit-ne-tolko-zaklyuchat-braki-no-i-menyat-pol-v-dokumentah-chto-pridumali-v-sovete-federatsii)"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Russian government is trying to ban transgender people from getting married and legally transitioning (changing documents)', 'created': 1595043999.0}"

So I was born a male and currently am 29, it's probably not been that long since my ""eureka"" moment say maybe a month? I had this beautiful moment where I cried and pretty much accepted 100% that I was living a lie and wanted to be a woman. I googled and read so much about it and what was involved and everything I came across I was like ""yup, sure, let's do it!"". (Literally everything!) I started to ponder on my past and found things that made sense, like why I always chose to portray myself as a woman online or in video games or anywhere I felt safe. In my dreams my dreamself was a woman and my sexual fantasies are always me as a woman.I did the whole dressing up, playing with more girly toys etc.There is loads of other moments and things that confirmed it as well (honestly I'm not some creep behind a computer just wishing for breasts!) but like I said we've all got lifes to live!  

So like I said over the past few weeks or month I have accepted this and am genuinely excited, my new look shopping basket is overflowing online, I am trying make up and clothes on, taking pictures and feeling so much better in myself as I do them. But... I am still questioning it, I am still looking at myself in the mirror and thinking ""what are you doing?"", ""this is just a phase"", ""you'll end up regretting this"" &lt;- (this one really hurts!!) ""You're just fixated on it as you're reading about it all the time"", ""You're not even sure you are trans"" and countless more damaging and negative thoughts. I know they are my own thoughts so it's down to me to sort out but has anyone else had this? 

Is it normal to question yourself to the point where you're unsure you want to do it? I know i still want to ""experiment"" and play with my gender and see where it takes me. There is definitely that side of me still there or else I wouldn't be here typing this out. Deep down I am as sure as ever that I need to travel down this path and see where it goes. I know if I don't I'll regret it. I just need some help on how to douse out this fires of doubt and fear. Anything will be appreciated no matter how small!!

I'm very scared of coming out as trans and even more scared of the process of becoming female.
I'm a decently to good looking male right now, my voice is very manly and I have a lot of hair, even when compared to people 5-10 years older than me, so I'm very scared to try to change my gender, but in the end it going wrong and me staying visibly manly even after years and years of transition. Another thing that makes me worry a lot is me losing the privilege that I have being a straight, white male, who has never had any problems with girls and then being a lesbian girl, where its still very apparent that I was born male and losing all the privilege I've held all of my life.

2020-07-20 22:39:36,huvibp,2,9,"\*\*Big Edit for my coming out story:\*\*

After I read the answer I got I decided to just go with it and be honest with my dad ...Regardless on what'd happen.

I gotta be honest, I expected him to be FURIOUS and lash out at me as this would be a gigantic change in his life and mine. My mom often confirmed that this would be the outcome as she knows him, and she and I both know changes makes him panic and get angry...So obviously I wasn't quite sure of myself.

But I knew that it wouldn't be fair for him to hide it all away from his eyes, and that if I want to transition and change my name someday I have to tell him...Wether he likes it or not. So when he got out of his room and asked me why I was looking so sad I decided to ask him to chat in private for a little while. He was obviously confused, but sat anyway, watiting for me to talk and tell him...

And so I told him nothing but five words

""...I wanna be a boy.""

He paused for a moment, looked at me silently for a while and suddenly got up his chair and left, still not muttering a single word.

\*\*I was livid.\*\* I thought he was gonna ignore me, hate me, that this was too much of a change for him to handle and that he'll  never see me as a man. In my mind I had messed up, was a failure as a woman, should've never told him all this and should've kept quiet. I felt ashamed.

So instead of waiting for him to get back I ran to my room, the only place in the house he never visits as he knows it is my safe place, where I draw and take all my stress away.

I began to cry loudly for a while, thinking that my life was over...Until I began hearing the stairs leading to my room creaking.

Someone was coming...And I knew who it was.

Oh no, he was coming.

As he was behind the door I could feel his presence, waiting, then I heard a small knock. That's when my reason went over my fears and I began to think. If he really WAS mad he would've open the door right away, but he didn't.

So I opened the door, and there he was, looking sort of confused. He gently told me to come back down when I felt better, so we could chat. I had never seen him like this before. I was confused.

After a short while I joined him and we began chatting a little, giving each other the time to talk. Turns out he got a little panicky because he couldn't tell wether I want to be a tomboy that's into girls or if I wanted to fully transition to a man. I giggled a bit and explained to him that I didn't want to fully transform my body as I managed to love my shapes and the way I am, that I only wanted to change my clothes, name and gender identity.

We went on for a bit and I could tell he really wanted to understand and help me. He gave me some advice along the lines of ""I understand what you want, but I think you're trying to rush things a little. Give yourself some time to think and do it bit by bit once you feel certain."" and I completely agreed.

This was less than half a week ago. I am now officially transgender and supported by all my close relatives. My grandma and mother are already used to the new pronouns and appearance, and my dad is slowly getting there.

He sometimes uses my female name by mistake but most of the time he realises it and corrects himself, and he seems to try to use male pronouns from time to time. I don't mind because I can tell he's trying his best, I know adaptation isn't his thing so I'm honestly grateful and will be more than glad to give him the time he needs to get there!

So here you go Reddit, that's the last part of my first chapter as a non-closeted trans man...And it's all thanks to yall.

2020-07-21 05:27:58,hv1mwb,12,5,"(English isn't my native language, so I apologize if I make stupid mistakes here and there)

This is the first time I ever mention this, so yeah

A bit of background beforehand:  
I'm fifteen, and as of now, I'm a he. I had a relatively good life, despite having an horrible father. He wasn't physically violent, but he really made my whole family's life a living hell. If he read what I'm currently typing, he would probably disown me, which honestly doesn't bother me, since my parents are divorced, and I haven't seen him in 2 years or so. Upsetting him would even be satisfying, in a twisted way.  
I know the rest of my family would 100% accept me, and support me.

Now that this is out of the way, let's talk about the important subject:  
I... don't know if I'm trans. Thing is, emotionally, I don't know. When I ask myself if I'm actually a girl, my first answer isn't ""yes"", and it doesn't seem I feel like I am.

But rationally, it kinda make sense that I actually am. It happened before that I pretended to be a girl online, and being called a ""she"" somewhat felt good, to the point that when I did say I was a guy, being called a ""he"" felt really weird.

But here's the thing: I have multiple trans friends, and I browsed this subreddit a bit before writing this, so I know a bit about what you guys call ""eggs"", and the multiple signs that exist that showed without a doubt they were trans.  
And when I think about it, I realize there's similar signs for me:  
\- I hate the hair on my body  
\- I prefer having long hair  
\- I hate taking pictures of my face  
\- I actually just straight up dislike my face (I kinda even hate myself a bit, so maybe it's linked???)  
\- I sometimes find cis girls beautiful and wish to be like them (never happened with a guy)  
\- I'm making this post (that's a big sign lol)

That's everything I can think of at the top of my head.

Logically, it makes sense to say that yes, I am actually a girl. It's just putting 2 and 2 together. Yet, like I said, emotionally, I'm not sure. I'm not sure if that's what I actually am, if that's what want, etc. I know this feeling could be linked to the fact being cis is easier than being trans, and coming out is scary. Or that the only trans people I know IRL are genuine assholes, and I subconsciously fear of being associated with them.  
\+, what if I'm wrong, and I'm not actually trans?

I don't know how to feel, I don't know what to think. I am just kinda lost. I have no idea what I expect the replies to be, or how anyone could help clarify my thoughts, but at least, I got all that off my chest.

I am 22, identify as FTM, and have been out for almost 5 years now. I am pre everything. 

I remember growing up favoring your typical boys clothes and toys. I was obsessed with Spider-Man and Hercules, I played with both Hot Wheels AND Barbies, but almost always wrapped their chests and cut their hair. Hated my hair long and tried numerous faux cuts over the years but they were directed towards women and never looked well. Had a god awful mullet at some point or another that made me ridiculously self conscious but I wasn‚Äôt really allowed any ‚Äúboy‚Äù cuts, I remember I would always piss before jumping in the shower, but always sit forward on the toilet because I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to stand to pee. Overall, I should have realized it sooner, but I understand not everyone realizes when they are young that they aren‚Äôt cis.

I was always afraid to look up certain things - my grandparents are relatively religious, my mom not so much, and while no one really knew how to go about checking browser history and things like that, I was afraid of them finding my search history. But I live in the south so most of my school was dominated by religious classmates...

I can out as bi in 2013 when I finally convinced my online (ex) best friend to date me. Somewhere in between there I began to question my gender. I knew most girls my age (young teens) were pretty ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù with their bodies, but I couldn‚Äôt come to terms with masturbating. I could get turned on but the second I would go to pleasure myself I was instantly uncomfortable and turned off. 

Queue me starting to really look into things, messaging ex, ‚Äúwould you still like me if I was a guy?‚Äù, shit like that. I realized around then being transgender was a thing and instantly connected with it. 

Now, I‚Äôve always been a bigger individual. Thus, having a massive chest. I began to get very uncomfortable with my chest. Band rolls around, we have Halloween on a game night, and we‚Äôre allowed to dress up. A friend came in with a binder on and I was like ‚Äúhey... That‚Äôs what _I_ want.‚Äù Got one myself, loved the feeling of freedom, wore it too long one day and screwed up my ribs. I‚Äôve only bound my chest a handful of other times since then because my ribs remain sore. I‚Äôm afraid to use trans tape because of an allergy to adhesives - I don‚Äôt want to have to explain to a doctor why my chest was covered in a rash in the way it would likely be. 

I‚Äôve bought a packer before and it‚Äôs exhilarating to wear it. I love the feeling of it. But I‚Äôm afraid to wear it out in public - again, I live in the south. 

I cannot bare walking around in any women‚Äôs clothing. I hated being forced into a dress and putting on makeup. Gauges make me feel more masculine even though I know they‚Äôre not gendered.

I want a flat chest. I can‚Äôt look at myself in the mirror. I want to run around with chest hair and my shirt off. I want a penis. I want to be able to stand to pee. I want to be able to masturbate in the way I do in my head. I want to be able to penetrate someone. But I don‚Äôt feel the same crippling anxiety and dysphoria as I used to. I don‚Äôt know if I have just gotten used to feeling like this and I‚Äôm numb to the feeling now or what. 

I haven‚Äôt started T for a handful of reasons - I‚Äôve forever been guilty with how I came out to my supportive mother. I want to be able to enlist in the navy and don‚Äôt want to risk ruining a chance at enlistment by starting my transition, so I‚Äôm waiting until I‚Äôm physically capable to speak to a recruiter. I want facial hair, a deep voice. But I‚Äôm not screaming behind my skin anymore. I feel so lost. I guess what I‚Äôm looking for here is validation. People that have had/are having a similar experience. 

TLDR: I came out in 2015 after dealing with a lot of dysphoria. I have yet to begin any part of my transition. I don‚Äôt have nearly as much dysphoria as I used to be still have feelings of discomfort, but it still makes me question whether my gender and if I decided on myself correctly",trans,Extent of Dysphoria Makes Me Question Myself,1595363094.0,"{'created_utc': 1595337894, 'id': 'hv79un', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'NSFW for mentions of sexual acts.

I'm non binary AFAB (basically go by every pronouns except he/him) but I thought I would probably get more accurate answers here than in the non-binary sub. I hope it's okay. Basically I would love to get pointers and advice on how to bring up top surgery and me coming out as non-binary to my dad. I'm 20 but I still live with him and am sadly financially dependent.   


I've always had body dyphoria in general and particularly against my boobs but ever since I found out about me being non-binary I'm realizing that this is gender dysphoria. I keep seeing more and more how they make me feel terrible about myself and like I'm not the person that I am when I look at myself. It's like it's someone else's body.

It's really hard for me to live with my boobs in my day to day life without having a breakdown when I see myself in the mirror, so I know I would need the surgery as soon as possible but since I can't pay for it I will need to get my dad's approval. He's generally tolerant so I know I won't be in danger by coming out at least but for the rest I literally have no idea how he'll react. I'm already aromantic and asexual and I've came out to him about that yeas ago and he was extremely and surprisingly weird about it. I think adding that I'm demigirl/agender and talking about the surgery might be the last straw for him. So I want to do this right and smartly.

While was reviewing university material an idea struck me.


And I'd feel deeply honored to learn thy,
- Opinions
&amp;
- Interest in the development of that idea.


I don't know how the ethics committee in my area will react to this idea.
But I think it is quite pertinent for us to discuss and express how we feel about it.




*  In summary, the thinking consists in 
   * transplant of, fully functional, lab grown genitalia.
   * Supplemented by
      * gene and hormone therapy.


* In other words, and being more specific, 
   * (concomitantly using some field words, if of which ya'll have any questions about, I'm here to answer), 
   * Was pondering:
      *  The use of, non-embryonic, induced pluripotent stem cells, to grow genital systems in lab;
         *  having genitalia differentiation managed by epigenetic influence of key gene expressions during the development phases.
      * Thus, offering a, complete, option for the genital transition surgery; in which paradigm,
         * Trans females, would be capable of bearing their own child.
      * And
         * Trans males, would be capable of generating sperm.
   * For the stabilization of this system, seemed viable,
      * The use of gene editing therapy in vivo,
         * Thru use of, intravenously injected, nanoparticles, containing,
            * The chromosome of interest. Be it X or Y.
         * And
            * A nuclease, custom made, to digest the chromosome in excess.
            * Eg:. Y chromosome in trans girls and X chromosome in  trans boys.
      * As a result, its expected, gradually improved, natural expression of 
         * Hormones and other cellular signaling, by the somatic cells.
   * All of that, backed up by hormonal therapy, while the body adjusts to it's new paradigm.

To start let me apologize if anything below is offense. I'm 40 (m) and don't know any of the new lingo.

I believe trans is a cosmetic issue based on a person's preferences and has nothing to do with sex.   
I think some boys might like dresses better or girls like short hair and other cosmetic preferences. Those people then see the opposite sex wearing those things and decide they want to be the opposite sex. 

The way I rationalize this to myself is people who think the're cats, reptiles, vampires or other things.  They like to imagine themselves in that way, role-play and they like the look, but obviously someone can't be a cat or vampire because its a different specie or don't even exist.  Changing sex is medically possible, but if changing specie becomes possible, do you believe some people were born human when they should be a cat?  What about people that want to be vampires? How do those people fit into this since vampires don't exist?

Another way I look at it is via a closed society group.  

Let's say you have 1,000,000 female(or male) babies and they all age to 15.  (please ignore the obvious problems with this scenario)

If this all female group is never introduced to men, how many will want to transaction to male, even if the science is known? I believe none would ever transaction. 

I think it's simply a cosmetic choice being made.  If your cosmetic choices are open and fulfilled, there's no need to transaction to the opposite sex.

2020-07-22 17:12:53,hvxqgt,5,3,"Hey all, I'm not trans myself, have had a few trans friends but prefer not to ask them deep questions for fear of offending them, so I figure the anonymity of the internet is my friend when it comes to this. 

So I think my 25 year old sister is either considering to transition or is in the process of it, she doesn't talk much about it, I figure it's not my business. But my question is, is how early did your dysphoria hit you? Is it common to come later in life? My sister has always been more of a tomboy for as long as I can remember, and I knew she was gay well before she told me. But I never actually got the hint or the notion that she wanted to be a boy you feel me. In all 16 years we lived in the same house I felt like I would've gotten some hint of it

Not saying I don't support her or anything, if you own anything in this world it's your own meat and bones and you should be able to do whatever you want with it. 

I guess I'm concerned cause my sister deals with a lot of depression related issues and has tried every SSRI in the book, and my dads a neoconservative dickhole so she's very bad about opening up about things to her family, especially regarding things LGBT related. She used to confide in me a bit more but she's kinda fell off the earth when it comes to reaching out. But with all this I'm just a bit worried she's hoping that transitioning will make her truly happy finally, only to realize it wasn't exactly what she was hoping for. 

I'm not a trans phobe, you people on here seem like lovely individuals, and hell, if my sister's happy as a boy and it stays like that I'll be nothing but stoked. But I just don't know if it's gonna turn out like that I guess. So I guess is it normal for dysphoria to hit at 25 ? Is it a good idea to go into transitioning when you've got other depression related issues simultaneously? Ill love my sister regardless, as much as a shitty lil brother can.

That takes indescribable courage and your experiences are absolutely valid. For this topic I asked about similar age groups because I feel it's important to keep things relatable.

Anyway, to the point now, work already knows, I'm dropping my inhibitions socially and especially in sport considering how I'm working on advocating for changes in sport regarding trans inclusion. The only group that's really left are my parents and to me that feels more like obligation than anything else. I don't have a close relationship with my family (parents and one younger brother) , and the same with my extended family as well. Personally, I could completely disconnect from any association to my surname and not feel like my quality of living would decrease ... if anything the guilt of staying obligated to the family would likely decrease but the confusion about why my family allows drifting would increase. I also know that if I heard things like ""Why didn't you tell us earlier?"" or ""We thought so."" or ""As long as you're happy."" or whatever would likely get a blown-up response.

The most we really talk are one-line emails at the absolute best. ""Hi, happy 70th, hope you have a good day."" is a good example. Knowing that, lots of me feels like an email saying ""For the record and going forward, I'm transitioning to Taylor, use the name Taylor when I tell you, and it is what it is."" or something similar. I don't feel like an in-person talk or call does anything meaningful for me except put me into conflict.

The other thought is to forward them the last email I'm at regarding my aforementioned advocation (context: reached out to and have correspondence with local sports leagues, city officials, and local sports media) and again, having a simple note about it. ""This is happening and I figure it's important you guys find out before it gets to you through the grapevine. Get a hold of me if you have any questions."" and leave it up to them to touch base on it.

The last thought is to just keep on keeping on and then one day some day whenever I see them next if there's a comment about hair or a piercing or style or nails or whatever, it's as simple as ""Yeah, this happened.""

For the longest time I have had these feeling of just not feeling right about myself. I've always felt that I was trapped inside of myself if that makes since. since I was really young, I would have dreams of being a girl and, play as a girl when my brothers and I ""Played with our selves"" ( It was literally role playing but we didn't now what to call it at the time so our nieav minds called it that ), and often got along better with girls. I didn't tell anyone about it because my dad taught my brothers and I to bottle up our emotions because ""I'm a Man"" so I often didn't tell anyone about anything unless if I absaloughtly had too ( Which probably lead to the majority of my social and mental health issues ). Also at the time, I didn't know about the LGBTQ+ community because my dad didn't want to have us know that stuff even existed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later on my Dad began dating my step mom. My step mom has a brother who is gay but I didn't now about that yet. at some point I got this old radio that was my step aunts and I herd a program about transgender people and asked my step grandma. she explained it and was confused why my dad had never told my siblings and I about it. I thought it made since and  supported it seacrity. a few months later we would go to my grandparents house. here I would meet my step uncle. before we went, my parents sat my brothers and I down to talk about this sexuality so that we can under stand him and not embarrass my parents, which we wouldn't have done anyway because we were in 4th grade and we knew more than adults' would expect. this made since, but my parents ended with saying that if me or my brothers were to come out as gay (or something similar), they would cry themselves to sleep and never see us as the same. that hart at the time because I couldn't understand how people could react that way that at the end of the day didn't affect them in an negative way at all. This stuck in my mined.

&amp;#x200B;

More recently these feelings of just not feeling right have gotten worse. I feel just horrible about how I look, who I am, why I feel like I'm trapped in someone else. I have gotten worse in my ability to think and pay attention to things because my mined wont get off of these feelings. I have also been having suicidal thoughts due to these feeling which make me afraid of myself. I feel that I might be trans, in fact I wouldn't be that surprised if I am. I just feel that I need someone explain to me if I am, or if I am not. I am afraid to ask a friend or a family member of fear that it would get out, or I would loos someone over it.

This is the first time I have ever had anything important enough to post. I assume this is the right place to do it.

I was born male and have always had stereotypically male interests (cars/motorsport, military stuff, etc) and I feel like I've lived a relatively comfortable life that way and I've always presented as masculine. I'm tall, broad(ish), have an average male voice but I've never been overweight or particularly muscular. I've never been happy with the way I look and I've put that down to normal male body-image issues. I'm ambivalent about pronouns and my name but nobody has ever really used female ones to refer to me anyway.

Lately -for obvious reasons- I've had a lot more time to myself to think. The other week I thought I was going crazy and shaved all of my body hair. I keep imagining myself as a woman and I'm holding back tears. I've completely lost my appetite and I'm almost constantly stressed to the point where I feel sick. I've been trying to keep busy but I can't take my mind off it. I've been more feminine when I'm home alone and I feel great when I do something really simple like swinging my hips when I walk. I'm waiting for delivery of a dress I bought online and I'm really looking forward to it.

Also, my girlfriend mentioned last week (sort of as a joke?) that her perfect sexual partner was a pre-op trans woman and I got unreasonably excited by that.

I ended up browsing some trans reddits and was genuinely scared about how relatable my experiences are. I started to see that maybe I had some signs when I was younger: I was jealous of girls and what they got to wear as a child, I tended to roleplay as female in playground games, and I didn't care about the difference between girls/boys toys. At 11/12 ish, I raided my mum's makeup bag (I looked ridiculous) and when I discovered porn, I always self-inserted as the girl. I learned pretty early on that I was bi but I don't really enjoy gay porn. I started half-hearted crossdressing about that time and my main take was how bad I looked and it put me off. I started to feel like I had some weird fetish. Cue Uni, and a club I was in had a crossdressing social. I couldn't figure out why the other guys put so little effort into it; I bought an outfit, got a wig and got the girls to help me with makeup. I felt really high and I was probably putting people off with how different I was acting. We ended up in a club and people were telling me how pretty I was and I loved it.

I'm really confused, I've struggled with mental health before but this feeling (that I assume is dysphoria) has come on so strong and so suddenly that I don't even know if it's real. I didn't realise until recently that being sort of comfortable as a man but still wishing I was born a girl wasn't normal. I feel like what's been putting me off all this time is whether or not I'd pass. I read that HRT doesn't effect your hips past 25 (I'm 25) and that actually annoyed me. Now I'm worried I'm leaving it to late to do anything about it.

Excuse my shitty grammar and phrasing, I'm a bit of a mess.

My questions:

1. Who (in the UK) should I talk to?

2. Can anyone relate to my experience?

3. I can't tell if I'm feeling this way because I've convinced myself or if I've been bottling real feelings for all these years, is that normal?

2020-07-22 22:33:11,hw3qc9,4,1,"Hello, I've been having some doubts about my gender identity lately. I'm not really comfortable talking about this with my friends and family right now, but I feel like I can't just keep this bottled up. I feel like I've just been waiting for the answer to finally fall into my lap. Yes, I am trans, or no I am not trans. So I'm hoping that maybe some people here will help me get at least a little bit closer to the answer.

So some background on myself, and some reasons why I think I might be trans, and some reasons why I think I might not:

So I'm 20 years old and was born a male. I never really thought at all that I might be trans until 5-6 months ago. Those feelings initially only really lasted a few weeks, so I figured that maybe it was just a phase, and it was some other kinds of feelings materializing in a weird way. But more recently it's come back, and it feels more serious this time somehow.

Yes, I have had some thoughts at times that seem pretty clearly trans: like I've looked in a mirror, and had the thought pop into my head ""I wish I was a girl"". It's almost subconscious though, like an automatic thought. When I actually think about it more deeply, I'm not sure it's right.

For one thing, I've looked up on Google various ways to ""know if you're trans"". And I feel like my feelings aren't as serious as some other people's? Like I don't hate the idea of being a man or anything. I'm not uncomfortable when people call me a boy or refer to me as ""he"" or anything like that. I don't hate my current body or my penis or anything. Though on the other hand, some of the things I like about my body are sort of more feminine things. Like for example, I have a really small waist for a guy, but I kind of like that. 

Another thing is, while I am definitely only attracted to women (whether that makes me a straight man or a lesbian woman is still to be determined I guess), there are often more unconventional feelings there. Often when I see a very attractive woman, I might actually feel jealous rather than just attracted to her. 

So the other thing that gives me doubts is how new these feelings are? Part of me feels like if I were actually trans this kind of stuff would've come up before. Also I feel like most trans people seem to be more sure about it? Like I've heard people say that when they heard someone else describe being trans, they instantly identified with it, which hasn't been the case for me because, as you can see, I'm still very much having doubts. 

On the other hand, I'm not sure that there were never any signs in my childhood? I could be missing some for sure. And one other big thing is that I've always kind of been obsessed with the concept of transgender since I first heard about it. Like I would look up stories about people transitioning and stuff. Just to give one example, one of my favorite shows is Futurama, and I've seen all the episodes many times. But the episode I've seen the most? The one where Bender turns into a girl. Yeah...I've seen it a lot. Also watched the episode where everyone changes gender a lot, as well as the episode where they switch bodies, as there's some gender swapping there. So as I got older, my interpretation of this obsession was initially that maybe I had a transgender fetish or something, because it wasn't really ever an obsession with the idea of being transgender myself, but other people. 

A couple other things that I don't really think are signs but could be: I don't remember this, but according to my Mom, when I was very young, I was obsessed with the idea of having a sister. I'm an only child, but at stores I would point out clothes intended for girls and tell my Mom that I wanted a sister so that we could get those for her. Again, I don't remember this at all, so I can't really elaborate on those feelings. Another thing is that when I was younger, I would be mistaken for a girl a lot. And sometimes when it would happen I would blush and get really flustered, and that embarrassment seemed more than normal for that kind of situation, so maybe it could be related.

Another big thing is how scary the whole concept feels to me. I've looked up stories and pictures of people transitioning lately to try to see how I would feel about it happening to me, and it really freaks me out. I feel like now some people will want to ask me: if I could press a button to instantly become a girl, would I? Because they would be trying to diagnose if I was just scared of the process and all the inconveniences that might come along the way. But honestly? I really don't know what I would do if I had that button. I'm so unsure what I want.

Again, I feel like my feelings aren't as extreme compared to trans people I know. Like I'm not really having mental health issues because of this. I'm not depressed or anything. I do have some anxiety issues sometimes, but it's not very severe. Though notably, I get a lot of anxiety whenever I think about this stuff, and I've basically been anxious the whole time I've been writing this post. When I was much younger (like 9 and younger), I had some anger management issues, but those are completely gone. Now I'm pretty much the opposite; I'm fairly hard to anger. So it's not like I feel like I need to be a girl to be happy or anything like that.

A couple random tidbits: I seem to have dreams where I'm a girl a lot. I talk about my dreams to my friends a lot, and one of them even commented on it. And yes, I have daydreamt about what it would be like to be a girl, and I've often wished I could have different ""save files"" for life, like in a game, so that I could be a girl in one of them.

Sorry this post is so rambling, but I wanted to get all my thoughts out on this. I'd love to get some advice on whether or not people think I'm trans, and what I should do next either way. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you think might be relevant, or give more context if it's needed. I'd like to hear from some people who have gone through these kinds of doubts and how they figured it out. Optimally, I'd like to hear from both sides, both people who were doubting and realized they were trans, and also people who realized they weren't (not just people in denial). Though I doubt there are too many people from the latter group on this subreddit, and I don't know how common that is anyway.

Thank you to anyone who helps me out! I'm fine to talk publicly in the comments here, but we can also talk over PMs if you think that would be a good idea.

EDIT: A few other things I thought of that I feel like are different from how most trans people seem to be. I guess this stuff is hard to say for sure since I don't even know if I'm trans yet, but if I were, I don't think I would care about pronouns as much as other people seem to? Like I've seen people talk about how upset they are when people use the wrong pronoun, but I don't think it would bother me all that much (obviously it would if it were part of them trying to deny my identity or oppress me, but otherwise it wouldn't). Similarly, I don't think I would hate my old name if I changed to a more feminine name. I actually quite like my name. Lastly, I don't really have any desire to be ""girly"". Like I'm not into skirts or dresses or anything like that. I've never really had a desire to crossdress or anything. Not saying I would exactly be a tomboy girl if I were trans, but would definitely be far from girly. Not sure if any of that stuff makes a difference, but figured I'd add it in.

EDIT 2: Another thing is that I've seen a lot of MtF people saying that they often had more trouble making friends and relating with boys. I've made friends with some girls, but the majority of my good friends has always been boys. This probably isn't everyone's experience, but I just want to mention anything that seems relevant.

EDIT 3: Posting this in a public place like this has made this whole thing feel so much more real, and it's kind of freaking me out.

Hey first of all, I made a post like this like a week ago or so but I wasn't happy with how and what I incuded in the post. Here's a revised version of it. You can maybe read it if you want to know a bit more before posting something idk.

For some small information about me, I'm a 20 year old dutch guy. 

So let me start this off by saying that I don't have much experience with specific terms or stuff like that.

Okay and now to start for real, I think that for as long as I've been thinking, and could think like this about this kind of stuff I've never really felt at home in my body, I don't like showing it and I'm not very confident about it.

The really thinking about actually thinking I might be trans started a while ago, don't remember exactly when but like at least a month and probably a few? Idk. I don't know what triggered the thought but ever since I can't seem to lose the thought of it.

If I think back the first time I've had any thoughts on it was during high school thinking it would be fun as a woman. I had them occasionally and never thought anything of it. 

Recently I've been having the thought of that my life would be so much better if I was a woman, from the things I enjoy, representation, how I feel and the body itself. I recently saw a picture of a friend of mine and her boyfriend and in the picture I really wanted to be her instead of him (nothing based on looks or something, more about the picture) 

Something to add maybe that if I now got the choice continue with life or live it exactly the same again but as a woman I wouldn't even need a second to think about it.



Continuing on the my own body thing from before. 
I wouldn't say I hate my penis, it's nice to masturbate once in a while I guess but apart from that I do kinda dislike it, it's ugly, it's annoying and a waste of space. I don't like looking at it, not even when wearing underwear. 

Another small thing is that I heavily dislike it when someone calls me a ""strong man"" or when they need a ""man"" 

And idk, mostly thinking that it's maybe temporary or that I'm imagining stuff. Also like I'm very tall and idk if that would make stuff better for me if it were the case.

Like I like woman's clothing a lot more but I wouldn't wear it myself as a man. I haven't thought about stuff like that as much.

In any way, thanks for reading if you got here. Mostly looking for people with a bit more expertise and I don't really know anyone in my personal life that does.

2020-07-22 23:51:20,hw53ri,7,2,"EDIT: Sorry this is posted twice, I was having some trouble with my other account but I think it's resolved.

Hello, I've been having some doubts about my gender identity lately. I'm not really comfortable talking about this with my friends and family right now, but I feel like I can't just keep this bottled up. I feel like I've just been waiting for the answer to finally fall into my lap. Yes, I am trans, or no I am not trans. So I'm hoping that maybe some people here will help me get at least a little bit closer to the answer.

So some background on myself, and some reasons why I think I might be trans, and some reasons why I think I might not:

So I'm 20 years old and was born a male. I never really thought at all that I might be trans until 5-6 months ago. Those feelings initially only really lasted a few weeks, so I figured that maybe it was just a phase, and it was some other kinds of feelings materializing in a weird way. But more recently it's come back, and it feels more serious this time somehow.

Yes, I have had some thoughts at times that seem pretty clearly trans: like I've looked in a mirror, and had the thought pop into my head ""I wish I was a girl"". It's almost subconscious though, like an automatic thought. When I actually think about it more deeply, I'm not sure it's right.

For one thing, I've looked up on Google various ways to ""know if you're trans"". And I feel like my feelings aren't as serious as some other people's? Like I don't hate the idea of being a man or anything. I'm not uncomfortable when people call me a boy or refer to me as ""he"" or anything like that. I don't hate my current body or my penis or anything. Though on the other hand, some of the things I like about my body are sort of more feminine things. Like for example, I have a really small waist for a guy, but I kind of like that. 

Another thing is, while I am definitely only attracted to women (whether that makes me a straight man or a lesbian woman is still to be determined I guess), there are often more unconventional feelings there. Often when I see a very attractive woman, I might actually feel jealous rather than just attracted to her. 

So the other thing that gives me doubts is how new these feelings are? Part of me feels like if I were actually trans this kind of stuff would've come up before. Also I feel like most trans people seem to be more sure about it? Like I've heard people say that when they heard someone else describe being trans, they instantly identified with it, which hasn't been the case for me because, as you can see, I'm still very much having doubts. 

On the other hand, I'm not sure that there were never any signs in my childhood? I could be missing some for sure. And one other big thing is that I've always kind of been obsessed with the concept of transgender since I first heard about it. Like I would look up stories about people transitioning and stuff. Just to give one example, one of my favorite shows is Futurama, and I've seen all the episodes many times. But the episode I've seen the most? The one where Bender turns into a girl. Yeah...I've seen it a lot. Also watched the episode where everyone changes gender a lot, as well as the episode where they switch bodies, as there's some gender swapping there. So as I got older, my interpretation of this obsession was initially that maybe I had a transgender fetish or something, because it wasn't really ever an obsession with the idea of being transgender myself, but other people. 

A couple other things that I don't really think are signs but could be: I don't remember this, but according to my Mom, when I was very young, I was obsessed with the idea of having a sister. I'm an only child, but at stores I would point out clothes intended for girls and tell my Mom that I wanted a sister so that we could get those for her. Again, I don't remember this at all, so I can't really elaborate on those feelings. Another thing is that when I was younger, I would be mistaken for a girl a lot. And sometimes when it would happen I would blush and get really flustered, and that embarrassment seemed more than normal for that kind of situation, so maybe it could be related.

Another big thing is how scary the whole concept feels to me. I've looked up stories and pictures of people transitioning lately to try to see how I would feel about it happening to me, and it really freaks me out. I feel like now some people will want to ask me: if I could press a button to instantly become a girl, would I? Because they would be trying to diagnose if I was just scared of the process and all the inconveniences that might come along the way. But honestly? I really don't know what I would do if I had that button. I'm so unsure what I want.

In terms of how I would feel if I actually were trans, I feel like it would be a little different from what I've seen. I guess this stuff is hard to say for sure since I don't even know if I'm trans yet, but if I were, I don't think I would care about pronouns as much as other people seem to? Like I've seen people talk about how upset they are when people use the wrong pronoun, but I don't think it would bother me all that much (obviously it would if it were part of them trying to deny my identity or oppress me, but otherwise it wouldn't). Similarly, I don't think I would hate my old name if I changed to a more feminine name. I actually quite like my name, and I've never felt like it didn't suit me or anything. Lastly, I don't really have any desire to be ""girly"". Like I'm not into skirts or dresses or anything like that. I've never really had a desire to crossdress or anything. Not saying I would exactly be a tomboy girl if I were trans, but would definitely be far from girly. Not sure if any of that stuff makes a difference, but figured I'd add it in.

Again, I feel like my feelings aren't as extreme compared to trans people I know. Like I'm not really having mental health issues because of this. I'm not depressed or anything. I do have some anxiety issues sometimes, but it's not very severe. Though notably, I get a lot of anxiety whenever I think about this stuff, and I've basically been anxious the whole time I've been writing this post. When I was much younger (like 9 and younger), I had some anger management issues, but those are completely gone. Now I'm pretty much the opposite; I'm fairly hard to anger. So it's not like I feel like I need to be a girl to be happy or anything like that.

A couple random tidbits: I seem to have dreams where I'm a girl a lot. I talk about my dreams to my friends a lot, and one of them even commented on it. And yes, I have daydreamt about what it would be like to be a girl, and I've often wished I could have different ""save files"" for life, like in a game, so that I could be a girl in one of them.

Sorry this post is so rambling, but I wanted to get all my thoughts out on this. I'd love to get some advice on whether or not people think I'm trans, and what I should do next either way. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you think might be relevant, or give more context if it's needed. I'd like to hear from some people who have gone through these kinds of doubts and how they figured it out. Optimally, I'd like to hear from both sides, both people who were doubting and realized they were trans, and also people who realized they weren't (not just people in denial). Though I doubt there are too many people from the latter group on this subreddit, and I don't know how common that is anyway.

Posting this in a public place like this is making this whole thing feel so much more real, and it's kind of freaking me out. But at the same time, I'm pretty happy because it feels so good to get this off my chest even if no one really reads it. As I mentioned, I haven't really shared this with anyone else yet, so it's just been all bottled up until now.

I\'m not really comfortable talking about this with my friends and family right now, but I feel like I can\'t just keep this bottled up. I feel like I\'ve just been waiting for the answer to finally fall into my lap. Yes, I am trans, or no I am not trans. So I\'m hoping that maybe some people here will help me get at least a little bit closer to the answer.\n\nSo some background on myself, and some reasons why I think I might be trans, and some reasons why I think I might not:\n\nSo I\'m 20 years old and was born a male. I never really thought at all that I might be trans until 5-6 months ago. Those feelings initially only really lasted a few weeks, so I figured that maybe it was just a phase, and it was some other kinds of feelings materializing in a weird way. But more recently it\'s come back, and it feels more serious this time somehow.\n\nYes, I have had some thoughts at times that seem pretty clearly trans: like I\'ve looked in a mirror, and had the thought pop into my head ""I wish I was a girl"". It\'s almost subconscious though, like an automatic thought. When I actually think about it more deeply, I\'m not sure it\'s right.\n\nFor one thing, I\'ve looked up on Google various ways to ""know if you\'re trans"". And I feel like my feelings aren\'t as serious as some other people\'s? Like I don\'t hate the idea of being a man or anything. I\'m not uncomfortable when people call me a boy or refer to me as ""he"" or anything like that. I don\'t hate my current body or my penis or anything. Though on the other hand, some of the things I like about my body are sort of more feminine things. Like for example, I have a really small waist for a guy, but I kind of like that. \n\nAnother thing is, while I am definitely only attracted to women (whether that makes me a straight man or a lesbian woman is still to be determined I guess), there are often more unconventional feelings there. Often when I see a very attractive woman, I might actually feel jealous rather than just attracted to her. \n\nSo the other thing that gives me doubts is how new these feelings are? Part of me feels like if I were actually trans this kind of stuff would\'ve come up before. Also I feel like most trans people seem to be more sure about it? Like I\'ve heard people say that when they heard someone else describe being trans, they instantly identified with it, which hasn\'t been the case for me because, as you can see, I\'m still very much having doubts. \n\nOn the other hand, I\'m not sure that there were never any signs in my childhood?

2020-07-23 07:24:43,hwbdfs,1,4,"I feel like gender and ""transness"" for lack of better word is too black and white.

I know what I'm about to say could be i guess considered non-binary. However I've been sitting on this for a few days and need somewhere to express it.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, regarding myself, I'm not even sure what I am. I guess i fall into trans femme- genderfluid/NB?

Anyways, part of the reason I feel this is so black and white is because it feels like you either have to be hard set cis or hard set trans;  it feels like it's impossible to actually be in between, seeing as trans people are already hardly accepted.

If an AMAB wants to go on E, shave their legs, keep whats ""down there"", rock a moustache, and use he/him pronouns. That should be acceptable.

If an AFAB wants to go on T, be as hairless as possible and not get top surgery and use she/her pronouns, that should be acceptable.

If anybody wants to mix and match any type of gender expression or transition method as they wish, that should be perfectly acceptable.

I should be allowed to pop some titty skittles, rock my voice I was born with, and not worry about getting ra\*ped or killed because somebody tried the former, saw I was sporting the latest model of girldick, then does the latter. These things also shouldn't exclude people from jobs and housing, and just basic human rights. I fucking hate myself because it feels like I can't express any femininity without either being considered ""gay"" or feeling like that means I have to fully transition.

I thought that maybe me wanting to be a girl was a sexual thing, and that even though I thought about being a girl on a daily basis, I still have a lot of happy memories and don't think I can't necessarily be happy as a guy. Hell, I didn't feel like others did. I didn't feel wrong in my own body, I didn't mind my dick, I'd just rather be a girl. 


But every so often a realization hits me. When that faceapp thing happened, I was constantly looking at myself as a girl. I couldn't stop. I got ridiculously sad. That's when a part of me realized I might actually be a trans girl, but I still just stuffed it into the back of my mind. There's no way I will undergo any kind of surgery nor will I tell anyone about this.


Today though, I had a realization, a memory. A memory of when I was 9 and watched the movie ""Its a boy girl thing"". Even then, I was nervous that my mom would realize I actually wanted to be a girl. I really was confused even then, and it didn't start much later. That threw out the whole sexualization mindset in me, and today has been very confusing as a result.

I am trans. I'd rather be a girl, and that's been a theme my whole life. For the longest time I thought I was just overreacting, but now I'm sure, and it terrifies me.

I can't transform. Nobody would understand. I'm 23, a complete manly man. I'm bisexual, although not openly so, but apart from that most people would assume I'm a straight male, a football fan, a dude.

I'm 23 now and feel like it's too late to transition. Not only am I really scared that I'd not be convincing enough, (which would absolutely make me regret it all. I cannot do that), I'd be scared I wouldn't be attractive, or that it wouldn't make me happy anyways and that it would've been a whole lot of trouble for nothing.

If there was a button I could push to become a woman right now, I would. If I could switch bodies with a girl, I wouldn't even think about not doing so.

That\'s when a part of me realized I might actually be a trans girl, but I still just stuffed it into the back of my mind. There\'s no way I will undergo any kind of surgery nor will I tell anyone about this.\n\n\nToday though, I had a realization, a memory. A memory of when I was 9 and watched the movie ""Its a boy girl thing"". Even then, I was nervous that my mom would realize I actually wanted to be a girl. I really was confused even then, and it didn\'t start much later. That threw out the whole sexualization mindset in me, and today has been very confusing as a result.\n\nI am trans. I\'d rather be a girl, and that\'s been a theme my whole life. For the longest time I thought I was just overreacting, but now I\'m sure, and it terrifies me.\n\nI can\'t transform. Nobody would understand. I\'m 23, a complete manly man. I\'m bisexual, although not openly so, but apart from that most people would assume I\'m a straight male, a football fan, a dude.\n\nI\'m 23 now and feel like it\'s too late to transition. Not only am I really scared that I\'d not be convincing enough, (which would absolutely make me regret it all. I cannot do that), I\'d be scared I wouldn\'t be attractive, or that it wouldn\'t make me happy anyways and that it would\'ve been a whole lot of trouble for nothing.\n\nIf there was a button I could push to become a woman right now, I would. If I could switch bodies with a girl, I wouldn\'t even think about not doing so.\n\nI don\'t know what this post is supposed to say, or what I\'m looking to hear. I don\'t know why I\'m here writing this, but I\'m just scared and I don\'t know who to talk to.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""Yesterday I realized that I've wanted to be a girl much earlier than I thought I wanted to be one."", 'created': 1595619866.0}"

2020-07-24 23:00:25,hxbx8a,0,7,"Hi everyone;

You may have seen the news that World Rugby is proposing a ban on all trans women players, which leaked in The Guardian this week.

The new rules are based largely on a single unpublished research paper by Dr. Emma Hilton, a well-known TERF, and her collaborator Dr. Tommy Lundberg who were both invited to present at a forum held by World Rugby earlier this year. That meeting also included anti-trans campaign group Fair Play for Women as an ‚Äúexpert voice‚Äù. If adopted, there is concern that this will cause a ripple effect through other sports, effectively eliminating access for trans women.

I‚Äôm a trans woman who plays community rugby in California. I‚Äôve been working with a number of clubs around the country to mount a response in opposition to these recommendations, and we‚Äôve launched a petition that is picking up steam:

I'm slowly working my way into presenting more feminine; I've been buying women's clothes and doing basic(subtle) makeup for a few weeks. And I'd like some tips to work my way into the whole thing. I have always wanted to dress fem but for whatever reason i felt guilty, regardless it's fair to say I've put a lot of thought into this, I know what I'd like to look like but ive got very little experience with much of this.

Specifically I'd love advice regarding:
Makeup: I know basically nothing
Eyebrows: slowly shaping them because I'm not super confident
Fitness: workouts to loose a bit of weight while gaining as many curves as a male can
Body hair: I'm a lady guy who rarlely shaved his face until recently. I'm slowly easing myself in, bit by bit so I can get used to each part of my body that I've never shaved before. My face has been smooth for a bit, and I just shaved my arms for the first time 2 days ago. Any tips for the chest, legs, and booty would be much appreciated.

I've also got a roomate who I think knows, but haven't mentioned anything about it. I'm also a chicken when it comes to talking about this part of me in particular. He's rather open minded and I don't hide the real girly clothes I have, but he's never seen me full fem. So idk if anyone can relate to that super specific thing I'm all ears üòÇ

2020-07-25 11:50:22,hxlgy7,3,1,"Just for preface I'm 25 MTF


So I've been struggling with this for about a month now. I desperately want to transition. Ive come to hate just about every detail about how I fake my way through life so I can keep my job and family happy and it's crushing me because I know for a fact the the people who's opinions I hold highest (for whatever reason I can't figure out why) would be some of the few to not accept me. 

I'd lose my job, the last of my family, and possibly some friends.

And yeah I realize that's all normal woo she's going to end up struggling with standard stuff. But like the family I'd lose, is the only family I have left, my friends have all moved away in the last year and I don't really hear from them anymore. And like idk I guess I'm fine losing people on some level but like I'm reliant on this job to keep me in a home and I'd 100% lose my job if I came out since my father is my boss and he's made it fairly clear if I'm anything but a straight son I'm dead to him, and like idk why it even matters that hes ""proud of me"" whatever that actually means when you aren't around for your kid for the first 20 years.

But now works running out down here and my dad wants me to move to indiana with him??? Like if be living with him working with him, id never get any space away so I'd 100% not get to transition, but I'd have a job, and a home...

So like I know there's no straight answer for this. But how much is happyness worth?

Is it worth family?

Is it worth losing a job?

How far would you suffer for something you want?

Because right now I'm standing at the crossroads desperately wanting to go left but it seems all the ""good"" things in life that I SHOULD want are on the right?

And it doesn't help the only people I have that I can talk to about this just keep holding up the do what you want card like come on!! What help is that??

2020-07-26 21:53:28,hyfmtt,2,1,"Hi there! I'm Neo, a 16 y/o trans man!

I just wanted to share my story with the community, as I've been gaining a lot of self steem lately, thanks to the hormones.
(TW//ABUSE - TRANSPHOBIA) 

I've always known I was a man, but I was afraid that my family wouldn't support me so I was in the closet until I was 14.
Turns out, that my father does his best to make me happy, calls me by my name, pronouns (he/him), and comes with me to every visit I have to make to the doctor, which takes an hour in car, and he has to not go to work that day just to take me. 

My mother says she does enough supporting me, doesn't call me by my name and still uses my deadname when she's talking to other people, or she calls me ""her new son"" because she believes that Neo doesn't exist, but that what she says to other people, when she's with me she acts like she's the one that cares the most for me, that she's the most supportive, that nobody will ever love me like she does, which is false, now knowing what she does. 
When the doctor gave me the paper that my parents had to mark as they were agree with me starting taking the shots, she wasn't there, so I called her and she told me: ""why didn't your father sign it as mine? he could have made a scribble as it was me"" and then ""don't call me for unnecessary things"". 
She's abusive, physically and emotionally towards me, and has threatened me multiple times by saying that I won't start testosterone if she doesn't want to, just to make me anxious and depressed because she knows that I can't deal with my dysphoria. She also says that I HAVE TO get top surgery, because if I don't I'll be a monster. She actually said that. 

She kicked me out of my house, and I've been living with my father for about two months now. I have to spend summer with him and then I'm supposed to go back to my mother's. 

I still have to deal with her through the phone, but I don't have to hear her screams and threats at me anymore.
I sleep in the sofa, I am not able to see my friends aka. my biggest support and I usually cry myself to sleep, plus I have insomnia and I tend to over think, so I barely rest. 

But lately, since I got my first T-shot, I've been feeling way happier and comfortable with myself.
I know it can sound like a joke, as my situation is terrible, but despite all the comments she has made towards me, I've never been this happy, I've never felt this good with myself.
I don't feel any changes yet but knowing that I'm finally starting to look like myself makes me want to share this with other people, just to tell them that they're someday gonna be who they truly are.

 Nobody's gonna stop you, try to ignore those horrid comments and be happy. ‚ù§Ô∏è",trans,Not even a month on testosterone and..,1595825608.0,"{'created_utc': 1595800408, 'id': 'hyfmtt', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi there!

I honestly don‚Äôt even know how I actually feel, since from childhood my personality has been nearly entirely performative and based around making myself feel what I think I should feel. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm not even sure how it feels to feel something organically. If anyone has related to this, please tell me how you made sense of it.

And
[this thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716433210105856)
Which were relatable, hence the switch between first and third person.

Why I might be trans:
- I think I would feel more comfortable in a woman‚Äôs body. The idea of it just seems cozy
- Growing up, I have always been jealous of women, for no specific reason
- I don‚Äôt want to put effort into how I look, if I‚Äôm looking masculine
- I‚Äôve always felt feelings of otherness from people, but especially men	
- When you get ready to go, you just roll out of bed and throw on whatever. You don't really do any self-grooming, or care about what's on your body. You're a little proud of your lack of vanity, your deeper, non-appearance-level existence.
- You have an underlying sense that you are ""not like"" most people. Your friends might get you, but you draw an instinctive and unconscious line between you and ""normal"" people. When you interact with a ""normal"" person, you're not sure what to say or how to act.	
- When you interact with very masculine men, you're nervous. You don't really know how to carry on a conversation with them, or want to. You feel an expectation, from them, to be something you're not. You quietly judge them for being too ""bro""-y, ""basic.""	
- Being vulnerable around strange men is terrifying. You're anxious when you use the public men's room. Changing in a gym locker room is unthinkable. You do not feel ownership of these spaces. You are very concerned about strange men observing you, or your body.	
- You're awkward at social touch. You might crave touch, like most people, but you feel like you're almost entirely incapable of receiving it warmly. When giving a hug, something about your torso feels like it will be *offensive* to others. (Whatever it is, they don't notice.)	
- You find it hard to prioritize your own feelings. You're aware of emotions you *should* be feeling, but they're distant and fake-seeming. When someone else is upset, it's much more real and urgent. You believe this is just your stoic, protective nature.	
- You often feel directionless in life. When asked about career goals in High School, you didn't really care about your answer. Even careers centered in your interests seemed kind of intolerable. You struggle to imagine a future for yourself where you are happy or fulfilled.	
- You only take steps to better your life when external forces *make* you. You'd rather withdraw and self-minimize and focus on escapist hobbies. You're just not motivated to attain nice things for yourself. (You tell yourself that this is a zen acceptance, a freedom from desires.)	
- Your inherent sense of different-ness from ""normal"" people makes you think that maybe you're supposed to be a creative. But the art you would want to make is about another gender, and you know that your authorship would be regarded as inauthentic (or, worse, fetishization).	
- You're worried that you might be homophobic, even though you believe in gay rights, because ""LGBT+ stuff"" fills you with a deep discomfort. It all seems so flamboyant and overtly sexual. It makes you want to shrink down and disappear, before you die of secondhand embarrassment.
- A sense of detachment or estrangement from your own thoughts, feelings, or body: ‚ÄúI know I have feelings but I don‚Äôt feel them‚Äù	
- Feeling split into two parts, with one going through the motions of participating in the world and one observing quietly: ‚ÄúThere is this body that walks around and somebody else just watches‚Äù	
- Feeling as if you have an ‚Äúunreal‚Äù or absent self: ‚ÄúI have no self‚Äù	
- Being absorbed in yourself and experiencing a compulsive self-scrutiny or extreme rumination
- Having an ongoing and coherent dialogue with yourself	
- Feeling like a veil or glass wall separates you from the world	
- Emotional or physical numbness, such as a feeling of having a head filled with cotton	
- Lacking a sense of agency or spontaneity ‚Äî feeling flat, robotic, dead, or like a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù, as if merely ‚Äúgoing through the motions‚Äù	
- Difficulty imagining a future for yourself	
- Being able to think clearly, but feeling as if some essential quality is lacking from your thoughts or experience of the world	
- A sense of disconnectedness from life, impeding you from creative and open involvement with the world	
- I hated the idea of body hair and used to pluck it as soon as it grew in
- I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve had to over perform masculinity and I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs because I feel masculine or not. Hell, a lot of the time I can‚Äôt even tell what I‚Äôm feeling and if it‚Äôs legitimate or just because I‚Äôve been performing for so long
- when hanging out with men, or presenting as especially masculine, I feel like I‚Äôm successfully tricking everyone around me or acting.

Cis:
- I‚Äôm not uncomfortable as a man
- I don‚Äôt feel grossed out by my body unless I‚Äôm thinking of myself as a woman
- I don‚Äôt mind masculine clothes; in fact sometimes (especially winter wear) I do enjoy them, though this does often feel more like a costume than clothing

(Btw, I'm sorry if there's any grammar error or similar stuff, english not being my first language, I'm trying my best) 

Anyway, I'm a 19 years old man who always considered himself as cisgender and heterosexual.

However, last night, I started to question myself about what I considered as obvious.
When I was a child (Like, 4-7 years old), I was more willing to play with ""girls"" toys (toy tea set, cooking toys, cleaning toys... You know what I'm talking about) rather than with ""boys"" toys. And unlike the boys of my age, I never had any difficulty to play and hang around with girls. 

Then, since middle-school, I started to think about what being a girl could be like and it never really left my mind ever since. On the contrary, it only grew stronger. The curiosity became a desire: ""If only I was a girl"".
I remember a time where I asked two of my friends if they could polish my nails, which they did. Another time where I was invited to a birthday party and there was a rule for men which was to put on tights and a skirt, I was the only one who did it. 
Today, I chose a female name for myself (C√©leste) which I use on Internet and social medias, pretending to be someone I'm not on the outside but that I feel inside of me (Sorry if it seems weird. It's just a way for me to be what I can't be in real life). I'm also secretly a fan of female fashion, something that I find elegant and beautiful to wear. 

However, the thing is I've never been bothered by my original gender. Being a man is, from my point of view, a fatality of life, something that I can't do anything about it. I just live with it, even if I would prefer something else. 
So, if I feel ""female"" inside, my original gender doesn't make me suffer like it seems to do with a lot of you seems (What you call ""dysphoria"" I think). I also know that I'm definitely not genderfluid or non-binary because, if I could, I'd erase the ""male"" part completely without any second thought. 

So, what do you think ? Could I be trans even though my original gender doesn't necessarily bother me ? 
And what do you advise me to do ?
I have a few LGBT friends that I could talk about my feelings but I wanted to know what you, those who may feel, lived or know similar things than me, thought about all of this before asking them.
I'm sorry for this long message but I really needed to say it, in order to ""take the leap"". And I would like to thank those who took the time to read it and answer to it.

Recently, ive tried drag. Im a freshman (sophomore this year) in hs. I live with my parents and am not getting a job until next summer, so i cant fully express myself without coming out as liking drag, but i tried some minor things, sorta experimented with it, and it just felt... natural. Like its something i could have been doing my whole life. After about a week experimenting with drag (mostly at night in my bathroom mirror), ive sort of lost that voice in the back of my head saying ""what if youre a girl,"" and it got replaced with one saying ""cant wait to grow up and experiment more with drag.""

Ive heard tons of stories of cis male drag queens eventually coming to terms with themselves and identifying as female later in life. Could that happen to me? Maybe.

There once was a person born a man, but every time they closed their eyes they were a woman. They lived their life as a man. They worked their first jobs, and joined the military as a man. They helped raise the friends of their family as a man. But every time they dreamed they were female. Every time they made something to represent themselves they were female. Every time they looked in the mirror they saw something that did not feel right. 

As they were looking at ways to change the Military broke them, and now they rely on the V.A. to live. Their little sister had a niece who they feel responsible to raise. They looked at all things and weighed the odds and ultimately they would lose more than they would gain they thought. The V.A. would blame their trauma on this and not what happened to them. Their family would disown them and the Niece they live to see grow up would be gone. The surgery is expensive and not perfected. So they stay a man.

Every day they meet people that are like them. Most have chosen the path they did not walk. When they speak to others about it they are often scorned.

The few I‚Äôve told so far have reacted well. But boy howdy if it isn‚Äôt a tense feeling working up to it. Like equal mix excitement and terror.

So far I‚Äôve told a few friends who I knew were pro lgbt so that made it easier, but still got a little rush of Adrenalin while I prepaired to tell them and ngl even when coming out to some of my lgbt or trans friends I was like ‚Äúoh god what if they are actually secret Terf spies and end up hating me‚Äù which feels kind of silly but man was I nervous.

The possitive reactions so far have been really helpful for my self esteem/ mood though! And I even told my ex, who had been mildly transphobic 5 years ago when we were dating and even she was super supportive and said she would give me a bunch of clothes and makeup for my birthday which made me exstatic.

Sex determination is down to multiple factors; genitalia, reproductive organs, chromosomes, secondary sex characteristics, hormones, neurology. 

Gender is sociocultural, with biological sex being one factor but is down to wider ideas about masculinity and femininity within the culture we grow up within. 

Binary gender is rooted in the idea of binary sex, bioessentialism deciding females are soft caring mothers-to-be by default so thus those of the gender 'women' who are delicate, like pink and babies, etc. 

Gender isn't binary, nor is sex - take intersex people, also maybe even transgender people (thinking in terms of trans women who are found to have 'female brains'). There can be variations in all those above listed factors in human sex determination, and variations in each individual factor. 

So here's the point...

Female brain Vs male brain is pretty problematic and shows up the flaws in our thinking about sex. There are multiple factors that contribute to biological sex, including neurology, but pigeonholing them into male brain or female brain is as bad as upholding gender binary/bioessentialism. It's still saying X is male/female rather than acknowledging sex assignment as biosocial, and human sex as a spectrum. 

Feminism has spent decades trying to challenge the idea of male brain Vs female brain because the latter was often assumed to be inferior. But now TERFs want to uphold that idea, and even feminists who are trans allies want to uphold the idea that trans people are just 'born in the wrong body', that they have 'female brains'. IDK something bothers me about upholding the idea of male brain Vs female brain when we're talking about trans issues.

First of all, hello, how are you all doing? I also posted this over to r/lgbt, but was told to also ask over here! Sorry to bother you all.

Second of all, as the title says, I am trying to write a story with a transgender character, and the last thing I would want to do is make a mistake, no matter what.

Overall, I am a little bit embarrassed to be writing this, but here goes nothing. For more context, said story is actually, well, fanfiction (feels weird to admit this, to be honest), and even if the character in question is not canonically transgender, as it happens in fanfiction, sometimes he is represented as such. I really don‚Äôt want to seem disrespectful when saying any of this, but if it is, I will delete this post as soon as possible.

Going back to my question, the story that I‚Äôm writing is supposed to be a romantic one. There are the two main characters, and some secondary ones will appear, but the first two are the important ones. Let‚Äôs call them A and B. A will, at the beginning, confess his love to B. A is not a very social or confident person, so the entire beginning will be dedicated to how B makes him feel, the little things he did that made him smile, that made him like him. However, when he finishes his confession, B will not answer right away. Instead, after a moment of thinking, B will tell A that he is transgender. Here is where I really don‚Äôt want to mess it up. I don‚Äôt want for it to be something extremely dramatic or tragic because, let‚Äôs be honest, I don‚Äôt think it should. However, B is (canonically) a very dramatic person, and so he won‚Äôt wait for the other‚Äôs answer, and instead he will simply walk away, thinking that his own statement would have been enough to throw B off, even if he really didn‚Äôt want for that to happen. 

I don‚Äôt want to write something that will feel like ‚Äúi‚Äôve been lied to!‚Äù or whatever. I want A to be confused, not by the statement, but because he will feel as if he had done something wrong by speaking about his feelings, that maybe he made B feel bad.

Of course, because I am cheesy af, I want them to end up together in the end. However, I don‚Äôt want my writing to feel off, I don‚Äôt want to misrepresent trans men, and I don‚Äôt want to be hurtful in any way. I know this may seem as a weird request (even more coming from a stupid fanfic writer) but I would like to write something nice for the people in the trans community that may read my story. As a person from the LGBTQ+ community myself, I know how nice it feels to be represented, and I want to do the same for others.

I really, really want to do a good job, and I would hate myself if I were to do something hurtful for the trans community.

So, yeah, basically this is it.

Do you have any advice for B‚Äôs coming out? Would it be okay for me to make him announce it like that, after the love confession? I read that it is best for transgender people to come out to people they are going to establish a romantic relationship with, but I want to make sure that it is fine to do it like that. Is there a proper thought process A should follow after the coming out and after B walks away? As said before, the entire ‚Äúi feel deceive‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sit right with me at all, and I imperatively don‚Äôt want to make it seem as if the character feels like that, because a trans person‚Äôs entire life doesn‚Äôt revolve around ‚Äò‚Äúdeceiving‚Äô‚Äù others or whatever some may say, it is about being your true self (or so I think, pardon me if I said something wrong there). However, as I did some research, I know there are different reactions to finding out that your crush is trans, but I don‚Äôt want (obviously) for it to sound transphobic. I really just want to show a process of thinking that looks good, that can show how to manage feelings and similar. I‚Äôm sorry if this sounded weird. 

I really want to show acceptance, to show representation, something that will leave a good impression on others.

And‚Ä¶ yeah, that‚Äôs it. That is what this little fanfiction writer would like to know.

I thank you all for your time if you did read all of this.

...And I would also like to apologise if I said sorry too much.

I'm Lorelai, I wanted to take a moment to thank Mae Dean from real life comics. On the 21st I was browsing one app or another and came across the story arc she's been working on since June. 

Mae, if you ever read this, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your story managed to cut through a lifetime of denial, fear, and pain. You gave me the courage to set myself free. I can never truly express what your work means to me, but I wanted you to know you've changed my life. I've been trying to come up with something grand and flowery for praise, but all I can say is thank you for sharing your story, I wouldn't be the woman I am today without you.

I just got back from riding my bike to a nearby CVS where I bought ‚Äúgum‚Äù (I got a visa gift card lol) My next step is to ask my close friend to see if I can have it shipped to her house. My only problem is that, because of quarantine, I don‚Äôt have anyway to get if from her.

That‚Äôs the biggest thing I need help with from you guys. The next thing is about when I can where it. I will try it on at my house, but I can‚Äôt wear it around my fam bc they‚Äôll notice.

So since Christmas last year I‚Äôve felt a little pull to being make/masculine. At the start It was height insecurities (175cm, wanna be tall) and that was nothing I was new to, it happens from time to time. at the start of this year it gradually spread to being insecure about features like beasts, hips, thighs, waist and my overall femininity. This continued to grow until about March where it reached a sort of peak. It was incredibly intense and was always in my mind. During that time I wanted to be a boy so bad, but I didn‚Äôt know why and hardly understood my feelings.

Eventually this cooled down over the course of a few weeks, it sort of faded but was definitely still there.

2020-07-30 10:01:49,i0jeoz,5,1,"Hello, I am a 26 recently out cis gay man and I recently realized few things about the way gay men of Reddit might be a bit insensitive at best and full on transphobic at worst. Since I don't really know well the subjects related to trans identity and I don't know any trans people (or that I am aware) I wanted to ask a few questions to people actually directly concerned. 

DM might be the best way to have a discussion about it so I would love to have some insights on certain matters. I'll still post a few questions here. They mostly relate to gay transmen as this seems to be what grind some cis gay men gears the most:
- probably very common but I want to ask anyway: is it considered transphobic to reject (politely and respectfully) a gay trans man when you learn about him having female genitals? 
- what is your experience within LGBT spaces especially men dominated (gay bars, night clubs, sex clubs)? 
- for thoses in a same sex couple (but different genitals): does it happen to you a lot that people question the fact you are gay/lesbian since you date someone that is opposite gender born ? 
- for lesbians trans this one : do you experience discrimination based on your genitals among cis lesbians.

I'll still post a few questions here. They mostly relate to gay transmen as this seems to be what grind some cis gay men gears the most:\n- probably very common but I want to ask anyway: is it considered transphobic to reject (politely and respectfully) a gay trans man when you learn about him having female genitals? \n- what is your experience within LGBT spaces especially men dominated (gay bars, night clubs, sex clubs)? \n- for thoses in a same sex couple (but different genitals): does it happen to you a lot that people question the fact you are gay/lesbian since you date someone that is opposite gender born ? \n- for lesbians trans this one : do you experience discrimination based on your genitals among cis lesbians. \n\nI have plenty others but I expect to have a discussion with someone that wants to help me understand this.

For the past two months I've read a lot about the subject and I will soon see a therapist and feeling euphoric AF. I'm sure I'm not the first to ask something like this, but do you think the results on from Faceapps are too hopeful ? On one picture, I have applied the female filter, with nose and lips. The second picture only has female filter.

Cheers ! :)

2020-07-31 04:24:51,i114lp,2,1,"Hello I‚Äôm new here, and attempting to step out of my comfort zone. I wanted help coming out to my parents and I want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience to me. 


A little background: Around 2-ish years ago I had a sudden realization that I might actually identify as a woman (this was after about a year of wanting to dress in drag, so I should have seen it coming). I noticed I had this intense dislike for my body (not all of it, I‚Äôm actually quite fit being a teenager with high metabolism and also being a martial artist since basically forever, which I enjoy. It‚Äôs the male stuff that I don‚Äôt like) so I waited it out for like, a year just in case it was a phase, as I am an pretty impressionable person and I wanted to be absolutely sure. After a year things just kinda stagnated, but at least I was knew.


Now the reason I‚Äôm nervous coming out as a girl isn‚Äôt because the people around me are transphobic, actually my parents are extremely accepting (my dad is the most open minded guy I know) and what little friends I have are open minded too.

As I stated before I‚Äôm trying to come out of my comfort zone a bit (I never would have written this if I wasn‚Äôt, I usually lurk online), so I‚Äôm trying to ease into this. I‚Äôm dressing up as a girl this halloween (whether it happens or not, thanks pandemic) as a way to get it into my parents‚Äô heads that maybe I‚Äôm a bit more feminine than they think. Any advice would mean the world to me because while I am fine being the only person in the world (that I personally know) that knows I am a girl, having the people around me know would probably make life a lot more fun. So if there‚Äôs anyone that has had a similar experience of being afraid of change, I would love to know how you dealt with it. And if you haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôd still love to hear anyways.

I wanted help coming out to my parents and I want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience to me. \n\n\nA little background: Around 2-ish years ago I had a sudden realization that I might actually identify as a woman (this was after about a year of wanting to dress in drag, so I should have seen it coming). I noticed I had this intense dislike for my body (not all of it, I‚Äôm actually quite fit being a teenager with high metabolism and also being a martial artist since basically forever, which I enjoy. It‚Äôs the male stuff that I don‚Äôt like) so I waited it out for like, a year just in case it was a phase, as I am an pretty impressionable person and I wanted to be absolutely sure. After a year things just kinda stagnated, but at least I was knew.\n\n\nNow the reason I‚Äôm nervous coming out as a girl isn‚Äôt because the people around me are transphobic, actually my parents are extremely accepting (my dad is the most open minded guy I know) and what little friends I have are open minded too.

1. I just wanted to ask how you feel about ppl refer to men and women in general as ‚Äòfemale identifying‚Äô or ‚Äòmale identifying‚Äô as an effort to be inclusive. 

To me, though I‚Äôm cis, it kinda feels like a micro aggression.

How do you feel about it?

2. And I feel like that also goes hand in hand with saying  ‚Äòpreferred pronouns‚Äô just say ‚Äòthis is my friend, HER name is...‚Äù bc most ppl will catch on. It just seems like subtle outing especially when it‚Äôs so unnecessary. Opinions?

And none of these I think come out of Ill intent either I just think it‚Äôs a thing a lot of cis ppl have never think about. 

3. Also another thing that‚Äôs a little unrelated but while I‚Äôm asking.... as a trans person do you think you need dysphoria to be trans? What I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs mostly a yes, but idk I want more opinions that don‚Äôt come from my immediate circle.
