My wife considers herself to be at least somewhat bisexual, but I’m asking her to straight up have a lesbian wife instead of a husband. She didn’t sign up for that. She is my best friend. I never want her to not be my best friend, even if we can’t make the marriage work. But I will stay and fight. \n\nThe best part about this is it’s no longer something I have to keep hidden around the house. I can shave my damn beard off. I can shave the rest of my body. I have a wig on the way, just a starter one. Nothing super expensive. And eventually, I can start HRT. She wants to help me with makeup and things like that. I have to say she’s being a trooper. \n\nBecca Joan has been born. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Came Out to My Wife.', 'created': 1596370763.0}"

2020-08-02 07:21:39,i285bg,5,1,"My coming out story is not the typical one. I grew up with Asperger's Syndrome and thus had a very atypical childhood, which made it in some ways even harder to come to terms with being transgender.

I remember when I was 13, at Disney World with my family for the annual Disney Princess Half Marathon. My mom joked about me wearing a skirt, saying I could if I wanted to, then laughing. I laughed too, embarrassed that secretly, I desired to freely wear one of those skirts more than anything.

For the next year, I would go into my mom's room and closet when I was alone in the house. I would wear take off my underwear and shorts to put on her panties and skirts, and sometimes occasionally wear one of her bras. I would walk in front of the mirror and put my hands on my hip and twirl, trying to act and feel as feminine as possible.

I just wanted to be a girl. I wanted to feel pretty, and I felt I had much more in common with the other girls than the guys. I felt like one of them. But at the same time, I thought I couldn't be transgender, because I was sexually attracted to women. Since my dad occasionally made jokes if my brother or I ever acted girly, I thought that if I talked to my parents, they wouldn't take it seriously and would make fun of me. Because my dad occasionally made those jokes, I felt like because of the body I was born in, it was shameful

Fast forward to my freshman year of at a college in New England: during the first week, I met a girl (for the purposes of this story, let's call her Lillian). She was an extremely liberal, kind woman, who had expressed in multiple statements that although she was not LGBTQ herself, she was extremely supportive of LGBTQ individuals. I began to open up to her about always feeling feminine, and she suggested the idea of being either transgender or gender-fluid. I found out that not only was it possible for transgender women to be attracted to women, but also that transgender women were even more likely than cisgender women to be attracted to other women. I realized I was truly a transgender woman; I just also happened to be a lesbian, and wasn't ready to admit all this to myself before this. She said if I ever wanted to borrow her clothes, her closet was always open. She also helped me search for high heels, skirts, and dresses online, saying that she thought I would look beautiful in red.

A few weeks later, Lillian left school for mental health reasons, and transferred to a school much closer to home. I started hanging out a lot more with my Quiz Bowl friends. However, I always would keep in touch with Lillian, and would send her pictures of me rocking my new skirts alone in my dorm room (I was lucky enough to have accommodations for a single, due to Asperger's). I began to open up to another liberal, LGBTQ friendly woman (let's call her Ally) in the group. One day, I come out to her, and she thanked me for telling me, asked me if I wanted to change my pronouns, and said that when I was ready, she would be happy to take me shopping for clothes and makeup as well as showing me how to use them. A few days later, I told her even though I identified as a girl, I still was attracted to women, and she said that didn't strike her as weird at all, and my identity as a transgender woman was just as valid no matter who I was attracted to. In November, I come out to my parents, who are semi-supportive, but insisted upon me seeing a therapist and waiting a long time before any social transition and even longer before beginning hormones.

When I get back to school, my therapist suggests it may be helpful for me to dress and live as a woman while inviting a supportive friend over to watch a movie or some Netflix for a few hours, as well as talking. I told Ally what my therapist suggested, and she said it sounds good. We were already planning for her to come over to teach me some makeup basics, so we decided to merge the two together.

When she came over, my heart was pounding. I had sent some pictures of myself in a skirt to Lillian before, but this was my first time dressed as an all-out woman: pantyhose, a white skirt with black polka dots, pink stiletto heels, a purple spaghetti strap, a gaff, and a wig. I was also originally wearing a padded bra, but I freaked out at the last minute and removed that. I did not even know how to wear makeup, and I was wearing a cheap CVS costume wig, so I was not passing AT ALL. When I saw her through my door hole, my stomach was in knots, and I was worried she would be disgusted. She knocked, I opened the door, and she came in. I looked down, embarrassed, but she looked at me, smiled and said ""Nice!"" I thanked her and said I was actually very nervous and was worried I looked ugly, and she said ""Aw, don't worry, you're pretty!"" She showed me the basics of makeup, and after I put the concealer on the parts of my face she said too, not knowing to rub it in, she chuckled and said, ""you need to rub it in; right now, it looks like war paint!"" Then I rubbed it in and she said ""That's better!"" We watched some of The Office and some of It's Always Sunny, and we talked. I asked if she would feel embarrassed to walk outside or into town with me looking like this and she said ""No! Of course I wouldn't be embarrassed!"" I told her how nervous I was before she came and she said ""Aw, did I make you feel better?"", to which, I responded yes, and said before I felt ashamed but she made me feel like it was something that was to be proud of rather than ashamed of and she responded ""Of course! It's nothing to be ashamed of!"" She asked me if when I started socially transitioning, whether I was going to take hormones, and I said I wanted to, but my parents probably wouldn't approve. And she said ""If you want to, you should! Your parents will come around!"" It was one of the best nights of my life.

My dad and I later argued about hormones and transitioning, before we all got sent home. I have talked with Lillian and Ally throughout all of this. Three weeks ago, I came out to everyone in Quiz Bowl, and two weeks ago, I came out publicly on Instagram to everyone on Instagram, to which I received nothing but supportive messages! My parents now support social transition, because they now understand it is something I need to do. They still don't support hormones, but said they would pay for it, so I am going to start when I head back to college (I attend a VERY RICH, very prestigious college in the Northeast where cases of COVID-19 are fine; they have invested nine figures into reopening safely). Also, we have agreed that I will come out to my extended family when I go back to school, because it is best that they find out while I am away from home.

Trans folks: don't worry! Even if your family is not supportive initially, it is quite possible they will come around! Find an LGBTQ supportive friend to open up to!

They still don\'t support hormones, but said they would pay for it, so I am going to start when I head back to college (I attend a VERY RICH, very prestigious college in the Northeast where cases of COVID-19 are fine; they have invested nine figures into reopening safely). Also, we have agreed that I will come out to my extended family when I go back to school, because it is best that they find out while I am away from home.\n\nTrans folks: don\'t worry! Even if your family is not supportive initially, it is quite possible they will come around! Find an LGBTQ supportive friend to open up to!\n\nI now feel so happy to be an openly trans woman, and go back to college as the fully-fledged woman I know myself to be.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My Story Coming out as a Transgender, Lesbian Woman', 'created': 1596378099.0}"

2020-08-02 16:28:28,i2evak,2,1,"Hello~

My name is Tuesday. I am a 25 year old trans woman, and... Well, my life isn’t in the best place right now :/

I have been transitioning for a little over 2 years now (shit’s wild, dawg), but I live in a small town and am not out to really anyone. I got a degree in English Rhet Writing, but I haven’t been able to get anything with it. Turns out, no one likes English majors- Or me, one of the two.

I started Tech School, a marketing program, in hopes of helping Sex Workers to help market themselves better on the internet, and maybe do that myself.

Guess who hates Marketing?! Tuesday, that’s who!!!

I’m considering switching to Journalism, which is more in like with stuff I understand and, well, care about, but... I’m gonna be honest. I don’t know that I can get a job, either because I’m trans or because, I dunno, job market sucks.

I’m in a really tough spot now. I wouldn’t mind SW, but I don’t want to be arrested, killed, or scorned for the rest of my life. Not only that, but entering the field is incredibly difficult. Odds that I’d be successful as a Natalie Mars, or an Ella Hollywood... Slim to none. 

I just feel TRAPPED. I don’t know exactly what to do now. I’m stuck living with my parents cuz I’m poor as hell, if I do SW while living with them, homeless. Soon they’ll move too, homeless. I don’t know what to do. Most days, I just wish I wasn’t trans :(

What are some tips or support for me? Are there good places to go to get a job as a trans woman? I don’t know what to do with my existing degree, and what to do with a potential degree in Journalism.

2020-08-03 01:38:04,i2o6yo,0,1,"Hi there! 

Firstly, I'll say that I'm not sure if this is where I should be posting this. If it's not, please direct me elsewhere and I'll post it in the proper place. Thank you.

I am a freelance artist and I plan on making a VN game. Representation is something that's very important to me and I wanted to include a transgender character as one of the love interests in the game, but I sadly do not know any transgender people in my personal life so I thought it would be best to ask at a source because I don't want to speak for a group when I'm not a part of it.

My main question is **1.) When is it best for the character to disclose they are trans?** I want it to be something they want to share with their partner, not something that's outed. I know that normally that depends on the person's willingness and readiness; but for this character I'm envisioning, they are out and proud to be who they are. However, since they've transitioned to their liking and they pass, it's not something they have to clarify as much anymore. 

As a player, if you were to encounter this character you wouldn't know they were trans. Do you think it would best for me to have them disclose that initially upon meeting or as things get more intimate between them and the protagonist?

My second question is more open-ended, **2.) Are there any things I should be careful to make sure I'm not misrepresenting the community?**

*For background, this is meant to be a casual dating sim. &amp; as a note, I don't plan on delving into social/political topics because that's not the main focus, and the fact that this particular LI is trans doesn't negatively affect them or their story route in any way. I'm not coding in any options that allow ignorance, bashing, or transphobia because that's not something I believe in, it would be blatantly wrong and overall their gender doesn't define them as a person in this game.* 

If I've said anything offensive in my post, please just let me know. It's not my intention, I'm open to being wrong and I'm always willing to listen and learn.

Thank you for any and all answers. I very much appreciate it 💓

2020-08-03 17:38:49,i31jn9,6,1,"Hi. I’m 15 and FtM. 

So I came out to my family a week ago. And they didn’t take it well, at all.

Before even coming out, I’ve felt this way ever since I was 12, but didn’t tell anyone because my family isn’t the most welcoming with LGBT+. 

And with this quarantine, I’ve had more time to think about this. I was genderfluid, then non-binary. 

After that, I told my mom I felt more masculine but she brushed me off and told me she doesn’t think I feel like that. So I second guessed myself and told myself that I was a Demi-Girl, so that I could be somewhat feminine to not make my mom upset. 

But even then that didn’t feel right. The idea of being trans messed with me for awhile because I knew that my parents wouldn’t take it well. 

I felt disgust towards my body, I didn’t hate it, it just didn’t feel right...like something else was supposed to be there but it wasn’t there. 

So I looked up testosterone, getting a binder, top surgery, gender therapy, even looking up bottom surgery. I wanted to be sure this is what I truly wanted. Talking even makes me slightly irritated because I want my voice deeper but it’s squeaky. 

I told my therapist about it, and she fully supports me. 

When I finally told my parents, my mom said that trans is trendy, she believes I’m mixed up from my concussion. (I got that in 2016 and still have daily headaches from it), that it’s such a miracle to be a girl because I can “give life”, and I like penetration so “why would you want to be a guy??”.

That I “should have told her earlier”. 

My dad said that it’s a HARD NO, he’s not going to be Dwayne Johnson, that’s is for my “safety”, and when I’m out of his house, I can do what I want. 

But they “support me”.

They won’t allow me to get testosterone, a gender therapist, no surgeries, mom won’t buy me any masculine clothes, and when told her I was buying a binder with my own money, she looks disgusted. 

They won’t allow me to come out to family, nor will I, because both sides of our family are pretty conservative. 

They don’t ask for pronouns, so I’m getting misgendered everyday, all day. I changed my name but I can’t tell them, so I’m being dead named too. 

They do it on purpose, and won’t even try gender neutral pronouns. Even with my siblings, the youngest (13) , get mad when I correct her on my pronouns. 

And our baby nephew is living with us because of the pandemic, so I wanted to go by Nana instead of Auntie, but she’ll still call me that but get mad when I tell her to call me by Nana. 

And with his mother/my oldest sister, she tries but can’t call me by my new pronouns and name because of my parents. 

I’m lost. They’re making me question everything but I KNOW this is what I want. I feel trapped and my best friend has been my rock. 

She uses my new name and pronouns. But...it’s not enough and it’s making my mental health worse.

I can’t even pass as slightly masc because my chest size is too big, and my hips are wide. I don’t have any masculine clothes and because of the way my hair is right now, my mom makes me wear a bow around my head to make it look “presentable”, and I can’t cut my hair too short because it’ll look like a “ni**a cut”...

What should I do? It’s like they refuse to believe this is what I want. I want to leave but can’t, so ya.

So my friend, i’ll call him L, came out as trans this year. We were super close pre-transition before i moved away for mental health reasons, but i recently moved back and we plan on meeting up again. They never spoke to me directly about wanting so transition, he just announced it to everyone on an IG post, since then i’ve really watched him blossom over social media. Looks happier, healthier, speaks more confidently and is unapologetically him and i love it, i’m really proud of him for all i’ve seen him accomplish and grow this year. 

Since they never really spoke about it directly to me, would it be alright to ask how transitioning has been? Im curious about how it was like for him, did he always know? Was he questioning a lot prior? Was it difficult emotionally, or easier from finally feeling like his true self? Would he get uncomfortable if i referred to the “past him”?

2020-08-04 04:11:13,i3cid0,4,1,"Hi everyone,

I am designing a survey and I have a question I am hoping that this group can help me answer!

When asking to identify your gender in the survey, I have these responses:
1. Female 
2. Male
3. Transgender woman / transwoman
4. Transgender man / transman 
5. Non-binary / third gender
6. Prefer to self describe 
7. Prefer not to say 


Someone told me “don’t list out transgender woman and transgender man as separate from male or female. It is offensive because it implies that trans people are not male or female.”


My question is: are there people who have transitioned that would prefer to identify as “transwoman” or “transman” as opposed to “female/male”? Or should options 3 and 4 be taken off the list? 

Thank you for your input. I want to be as inclusive as possible.

I'm a trans NB 17yo with gender dysphoria.  I've been trying to get my parent to agree to a surgery consult so that I don't end up having to wait 1.5-2+ years (turning 18 + waitlist).  They will absolutely not agree to it, which is crushing for me. It's been such a trigger for dysphoria, which has already been worse than usual lately, that I've resorted to self-harming in attempts to make things... smaller. It hasn't worked. It's too painful and I'm a wuss. But obviously I am not doing well.

My parent is convinced that it's unethical to let me have surgery this young, or even to let me have a consult. I don't like talking about my AGAB so I won't disclose much about what procedures and hormones I'm looking into, but I will point out it's not bottom surgery, which I would be more cautious about pursuing at this age.

Also, sorry if this post is a complete mess.

So, I'm sort of in a relationship with this girl. Weve been together for a couple of years up until about a month ago, when we broke up for mutual reasons, but we still want to be together and we're still seeing each other but I guess we're just not classing it as a relationship? Idk, the situations a mess, but that's not point of this.

The other day, she tells me she went on tinder. Just for the lols and just to get attention. She starts taking to this one guy and she says she not at all interested in him. Okay, whatevs.

Yesterday, I really wanted some weed, and my usual sources are in lockdown. So, I ended up using tinder to find someone in town who has any. 

I've used tinder once before and it's how I met the girl I'm 'not' with atm. I was only interested in women at the time so I had tinder set so. 

Not this time though. This time I set it to everyone...
So. Many. Guys. Now, I've never really had much interest in guys before and always ended up in relationships with women, so getting attention from guys is weird. Not bad weird, I'm just not used to it.

But anyway, I message this one guy, he's in my town and can get me weed, sweet. But he's clearly interested in me.

Now, I dont think I pass very well. I've been told I do, but idk, (if anyone asks I'll post a pic). 

But this guy (he's pretty good looking too), is just giving me compliment after compliment. I know it's pretty much just to get in my pants, but still, getting that kind of attention was just so... Different. Idk I felt like a giddy little 14 year old who's just been told she's pretty by a cute guy.

Anyway, I meet up with him, he gives me the weed and I sit in his car with him for a minute just chatting. He seems really nice actually. We say goodbye and he leaves, then I got to my 'not' girlfriends place to share some weed with her. 

She knew about the whole situation from the beginning, and she says she's totally cool with it. But I get the feeling she isn't.

I just feel weird and a bit bad about the whole situation; getting attention from this guy and him also not knowing I'm trans, kinda using him to get weed, the way my 'not' girlfriend feels about it.

I just need help processing this, it's not a situation I've been in before.

2020-08-05 03:53:38,i3yaow,23,1,"Let's see, how to put this without offending anybody: Trans is a cult! !

Trans is a cult because it maintains a status quo which cannot go unquestioned, yet everything about the Trans cult is questionable. So many individuals go their whole life feeling confused, lost, and the issue with cults is that they misguide such lost souls.

Where are you going? What is your purpose?

Trans is a cult that takes the individual out of their God-given body and attempts to place them in a sublime state of *false reconciliation* with their feelings and thoughts. It is a disjointed attempt to understand the self, which sees created matter as inherently bad; Trans is *Cathartic--*in that it is an extension of the Catharist way of thought.

Matter is imperfect-Matter is mistaken-Matter must be destroyed. That is the Cathar pattern of thinking; the Cathars were a cult. They killed body and soul by their poisonous words and turned so many cultures on the path of destruction.

Trans is like that but with a new addition: Matter must be *corrected*. Corrected of its ""flaws"" which are perceived by human intellect. But what flaws? Weaknesses, yes, those will come, but what flaws? [That is why,](https://biblehub.com/greek/1352.htm) [for the sake](https://biblehub.com/greek/5228.htm) [of Christ,](https://biblehub.com/greek/5547.htm) [I delight](https://biblehub.com/greek/2106.htm) [in](https://biblehub.com/greek/1722.htm) [weaknesses,](https://biblehub.com/greek/769.htm) [in](https://biblehub.com/greek/1722.htm) [insults,](https://biblehub.com/greek/5196.htm) [in](https://biblehub.com/greek/1722.htm) [hardships,](https://biblehub.com/greek/318.htm) [in](https://biblehub.com/greek/1722.htm) [persecutions,](https://biblehub.com/greek/1375.htm) [in](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm) [difficulties.](https://biblehub.com/greek/4730.htm) [For](https://biblehub.com/greek/1063.htm) [when](https://biblehub.com/greek/3752.htm) [I am weak,](https://biblehub.com/greek/770.htm) [then](https://biblehub.com/greek/5119.htm) [I am](https://biblehub.com/greek/1510.htm) [strong.](https://biblehub.com/greek/1415.htm) 

God creates: men and women live with the consequences. What consequences? The consequences of sin. [For](https://biblehub.com/greek/1063.htm) [the](https://biblehub.com/greek/3588.htm) [wages](https://biblehub.com/greek/3800.htm) [of sin](https://biblehub.com/greek/266.htm) [is death,](https://biblehub.com/greek/2288.htm) [but](https://biblehub.com/greek/1161.htm) [the](https://biblehub.com/greek/3588.htm) [gift](https://biblehub.com/greek/5486.htm) [of God](https://biblehub.com/greek/2316.htm) [is eternal](https://biblehub.com/greek/166.htm) [life](https://biblehub.com/greek/2222.htm) [in](https://biblehub.com/greek/1722.htm) [Christ](https://biblehub.com/greek/5547.htm) [Jesus](https://biblehub.com/greek/2424.htm) [our](https://biblehub.com/greek/1473.htm) [Lord.](https://biblehub.com/greek/2962.htm) The world is a chance to offer penance, not a chance to escape penance. The Cathar escapes penance through negation. Trans escapes penance through correction. But what is not wrong is not in need of correction--that which is not meant to be negated ought not to be negated. Then there are flaws, then there are the fruits of sin, and they amount to death.

But death is not always destruction. ""Tribulation and anguish shall be visited upon the soul of every man who works evil...But glory and honor and peace shall be awarded to everyone who does good....with God there is no respect of persons."" \[Romans2:9-11\].

Trans is a cult, of which there are so many in the world today, poisoning the hearts and souls, and even bodies and minds of men and women the world over. The nature of the cult is that it demands constant attention, it rejects *disagreement,* not always *explicitly* but *implicitly.* Those who are in a cult do not know they are in a cult--in fact, they will deny reality over and over again, even in the face of their loved ones who know them better than they know themselves.

Who knows you better than yourself? God for one, and He created you! Trying to understand God is the lengthy goal of life--it takes time, and doesn't happen overnight. But those who try to understand God might have a chance at understanding themselves. The painting cannot understand the painter, but God invites all [Come,](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1945.htm) [all of you](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3605.htm) [who thirst,](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6771.htm) [come](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1980.htm) [to the waters;](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/4325.htm) God painted us to understand Him, if we so choose. Freewill is a sticky wicket.

These gifts of grace (the Sacraments) are for the soul, they are understanding, and they are meant for perfection. Without them surely the soul would perish, the world would wane, and the corruptible earth would no longer exist. With God's mercy, [each](https://biblehub.com/greek/1538.htm) [of you](https://biblehub.com/greek/4771.htm) [must know how](https://biblehub.com/greek/1492.htm) [to control](https://biblehub.com/greek/2932.htm) [his](https://biblehub.com/greek/1438.htm) [own](https://biblehub.com/greek/3588.htm) [body](https://biblehub.com/greek/4632.htm) [in](https://biblehub.com/greek/1722.htm) [holiness](https://biblehub.com/greek/38.htm) [and](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm) [honor,](https://biblehub.com/greek/5092.htm) That is the only way to see the joy that is inherent in life, hidden in matter.

So many individuals go their whole life feeling confused, lost, and the issue with cults is that they misguide such lost souls.\n\nWhere are you going? What is your purpose?\n\nTrans is a cult that takes the individual out of their God-given body and attempts to place them in a sublime state of *false reconciliation* with their feelings and thoughts. It is a disjointed attempt to understand the self, which sees created matter as inherently bad; Trans is *Cathartic--*in that it is an extension of the Catharist way of thought.\n\nMatter is imperfect-Matter is mistaken-Matter must be destroyed. That is the Cathar pattern of thinking; the Cathars were a cult. They killed body and soul by their poisonous words and turned so many cultures on the path of destruction.\n\nTrans is like that but with a new addition: Matter must be *corrected*. Corrected of its ""flaws"" which are perceived by human intellect. But what flaws? Weaknesses, yes, those will come, but what flaws?

The Cathar escapes penance through negation. Trans escapes penance through correction. But what is not wrong is not in need of correction--that which is not meant to be negated ought not to be negated. Then there are flaws, then there are the fruits of sin, and they amount to death.\n\nBut death is not always destruction. ""Tribulation and anguish shall be visited upon the soul of every man who works evil...But glory and honor and peace shall be awarded to everyone who does good....with God there is no respect of persons."" \\[Romans2:9-11\\].\n\nTrans is a cult, of which there are so many in the world today, poisoning the hearts and souls, and even bodies and minds of men and women the world over. The nature of the cult is that it demands constant attention, it rejects *disagreement,* not always *explicitly* but *implicitly.* Those who are in a cult do not know they are in a cult--in fact, they will deny reality over and over again, even in the face of their loved ones who know them better than they know themselves.\n\nWho knows you better than yourself? God for one, and He created you! Trying to understand God is the lengthy goal of life--it takes time, and doesn\'t happen overnight. But those who try to understand God might have a chance at understanding themselves. The painting cannot understand the painter, but God invites all [Come,](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1945.htm) [all of you](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3605.htm) [who thirst,](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6771.htm) [come](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1980.htm) [to the waters;](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/4325.htm) God painted us to understand Him, if we so choose. Freewill is a sticky wicket.\n\nThese gifts of grace (the Sacraments) are for the soul, they are understanding, and they are meant for perfection. Without them surely the soul would perish, the world would wane, and the corruptible earth would no longer exist.

2020-08-05 21:06:20,i4dvd6,3,1,"Hi all,

If you are reading this, thanks for clicking on it--I am sure it gets tiring always answering questions. But, here I am with one for anyone willing/able to reply.

I saw something recently (don't remember where) where a trans girl made an off-hand comment that she dates cis men exclusively. I found this surprising as I just assumed that trans people would be more likely to see other trans people as their preferred gender, and this just seems to me like this person was invalidating trans men as men.

Obviously people are allowed to have preferences beyond gender, and genitalia preferences are fair. But as a cis woman (who's still learning) I still wouldn't say that I am not open to dating trans men if they otherwise fit my ""type""  so I am just trying to understand why this person would have that restriction.  

I am wondering without meaning to sound offensive, if you are a trans person, is there an element of dating a cis person of the opposite gender that ultimately more affirming to you, that you're ""really"" a woman if a cis man sees you as such? Or is there another reason for someone to have this view? Or, is this person just an offshoot who is totally off key from the rest of the trans community?

Trying to be respectful, welcome feedback if there's phrasing or words I used insensitively.",trans,Question from cis friend trying to better understand!!,1596686780.0,"{'created_utc': 1596661580, 'id': 'i4dvd6', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi all,\n\nIf you are reading this, thanks for clicking on it--I am sure it gets tiring always answering questions.

Boy did she not believe me, usual lines include:

""You are still developing"" (19yo)

""This is probably just a wider thing about your self hatred"" (took it for true until the next bit)

When I told her about a experience whit gender disforia
""It's not constant so it's probably isn't that.""

Well, after a long conversation with my mom about me being trans, and... it actually went pretty well. Surprisingly, she was pretty chill about it while we talked. She explained her views on it that, while I don't agree with, I understand. She asked me if I could pinpoint when and why it started, and for when, it was very very early, but as for why, I couldn't answer. She was respectful of my beliefs, and while she didn't agree, she understood. We kinda... sorted things out. It felt nice. 

 It felt good to be able to be honest about things, like my desire to get away for a bit, how hurtful it feels when she says some of the things she does, etc

Some of the things we talked about were pretty real. For example, one of the things she asked was if I felt like I wanted to be a girl because I was (***TW***) &gt;!sexually assaulted!&lt; at some point (the answer is no, because I was never personally a victim of it), or if I blamed her for any of my desires to change who I am (again, no, it's just been a part of me forever) Dealt with topics like religion and beliefs, lifelong happiness, abandonment, etc. Things I would fully expect to grow into a big argument. It never did.

It's like... A bittersweet ending. She doesn't support me, but at least it's clear that this is who I am, and if she wants a large role in my life, she'll have to accept that

One of the exact quotes I said was ""I may stop being your son, but I'll never stop being your kid.""

----

The magic in my book comes in a crystallized form called Mana. You can enchant objects by putting mana ore in physical contact with the object you wish to enchant then inscribing the purpose of the enchantment on the object. 

Magic defined as the manipulation of the physical world through the use of mana crystals. Whether that means speeding up the cells in a body to heal a wound, heating up the air around you until it combusts, or alter your body so that you become a more masculine, feminine, or androgynous version of yourself.

Mana crystals are found in mines and are extremely dangerous to extract, making them very expensive unless you are a social elite. There are blackmarket crystals that are mined illegally but they tend to be unstable and unpredictable.

The equivalent of SRS surgery exists and they are slightly more affordable for the average citizen, but of course the results are limited.

My question is, if you lived in this world as a middle class citizen, how would you go about your transition. Would you work your way up the social ladder to obtain a mana crystal? Would you undergo surgery? Would you risk the black market? Or would you forgo both options and live life without medically transitioning?",trans,I'm working on a fantasy book involving an ftm protagonist and other transgender characters.

2020-08-06 19:23:20,i4yb3p,1,1,"Hey !
I'm 19 and AMAB. In the last few months, I've questioned a lot my gender identity. 
As a child and teenager, I've never understood why gender existed. Never made sense to me. But even through I wished I could just behave like I want and try to conform with male standards because I am too anxious to be able not to do so. I didn't even asked that much question. I sometimes tried to figure out how my life could be different if I was born female (didn't really know what transidentity was at that point).

This kinda change when I was 17 and I started reading things about transidentity on the internet, but I was too much used to behave like I was expected to, ""as a man"", it didn't  come to my mind right away.

I started really questioning myself when I was 18 and I started living alone. I realized I really didn't like conforming to male standards and started informing myself on cross dressing. I didn't like my body and wished I had a female one. Most of all, I realised I hated being a man.
Then I kind of buried it I guess for almost a year, despite trying a little cross-dressing which really made me feel comfortable. But I felt I was better off going on as I've always been because thinking about a transition makes me really anxious. Even though I dind't feel like a man, I am not sure I feel I'm a woman, it's more that I wished I was woman.

And it came back for the last weeks. I don't feel confortable being a guy, dressing like a guy. Again, the desire of being a woman is strong, but right know I just can't tell myself ""okay, actually you're not a guy, you're a girl"", it's not that I am afraid of transidentity, not at all I swear to you I support trans people with all my heart. This statement just not feel accurate for me right now. Why didn't I realise earlier ? Why haven't I always felt this like many transgender people did ? Right now I'd love being to tell myself ""Okay, you're a woman"", but it just doesn't feel accurate. This feeling is so frustrating.

So I thought maybe I'm Non-Binary,  and I should keep my ""masculine identity"", with my name and the pronouns I always used, because I'm confortable with it and change makes me anxious so it would be very hard to make a ""social transition"". 
And on the other side try to more express that I'm not a man through dressing and trying to have a more androgynous look, which always has been a goal to me and I think it would really help being at peace with myself.

Sorry for this very long post guys I needed to express all this mess in my head.

But even through I wished I could just behave like I want and try to conform with male standards because I am too anxious to be able not to do so. I didn\'t even asked that much question. I sometimes tried to figure out how my life could be different if I was born female (didn\'t really know what transidentity was at that point).\n\nThis kinda change when I was 17 and I started reading things about transidentity on the internet, but I was too much used to behave like I was expected to, ""as a man"", it didn\'t  come to my mind right away.\n\nI started really questioning myself when I was 18 and I started living alone. I realized I really didn\'t like conforming to male standards and started informing myself on cross dressing. I didn\'t like my body and wished I had a female one. Most of all, I realised I hated being a man.\nThen I kind of buried it I guess for almost a year, despite trying a little cross-dressing which really made me feel comfortable.

2020-08-06 20:43:08,i4zsxd,3,1,"Q: What is your gender? 
A: Male / Female or Non-binary.

Q: So you understand gender as gender identity? 
A: Yes.

Q: Are you Transgender? 
A: Yes.

Q: So you think you can change your Gender Identity? 
A: No, Gender Identity is like sexual orientation as far as Science seem to suggest a born attribute, it can change in puberty, but after that it's a immutable attribute. At least there is no solid science that suggest otherwise yet. So what I actually mean is I have changed my gender expression.

Q: But when I asked you about your gender you understood gender identity, now you understand gender as gender expression, can you see that most people find that confusing or misleading and if you say to them that you are Transgender that even if they understood the difference between Gender and Sexuality they would assume that you change (transition) your gender Identity and not only expression? 
A: Yes I guess it must be pretty confusing.

Q: So do you think such a confusing place is very welcoming, and have you experienced Trans people that started name calling others just because they got some of the details wrong and build arguments around that wrong understanding? A: I guess that it's not very welcoming and yes I experienced people calling others truscum and worse labels, because of their maybe questionable or bad opinions, that is at least partially caused by very confusing wordings that are inconsistent.

Q: What do you think people that feel that are unfairly attacked because it's not their fault that the wordings in this fields are pretty messy inconsistent and shifts nonstop?
A: I guess they will become more angry when they get called such hateful terms.

So I’ve very recently been properly questioning if I am trans or not had a few suspicions over the years but I never really gave it proper thought. I used to think I was some degree of asexual especially seeing the experiences of my peers, but it didn’t quite fit properly as I do feel like I am sexually attracted to women and during the closest thing I’ve had to a sexual encounter with someone I did feel like I wanted to have sex with her but just not in the way a typical male would. 

Anyway I’ve been having a proper think and a lot of things are making sense and I think I might be MtF and as well as having a think I’ve been trying a few things and today was the first time my housemate has gone back to work in the office rather than working from home. So today I got to wear my feminine clothes and bra just while I was hanging around the house doing some chores and making lunch and it just felt nice and cozy, especially whenever a caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror which felt amazing. Normally aren’t the happiest with my appearance apart from my hair which is quite long and is usually the only thing I truly like about my appearance. And now he’s home and I’m back in normal clothes I’m just feeling kinda weird and a bit upset because I was having such a good day. 

Anyway I work with my sister and she’s noticed I’ve had something on my mind the past couple weeks and I kinda gave her a hint saying I was having a bit of an identity crisis and trying to figure out who I am and told her I’d be ready to talk once I’d figured it out. But I really do want to tell her and I know she’s going to be super supportive but at the same time I feel like I want to be certain before I come out.

Well, you see, in 2018, I ordered my first chest binder without my mother’s permission (she isn’t the most accepting person). She ended up finding out about it because my ex boyfriend told her. My mum was not happy and took it away (she said that she put it in storage, but I know that she just threw it out). 

I was so sad and scared that I didn’t want to buy another one because I didn’t want her to take it away from me again. 

About three days ago, I ordered my second chest binder. My family went camping this week, so I knew that I could order it without my mum knowing.

I got it today and I couldn’t be more thrilled! The binder I ordered is an Underworks Sports and Binding Bra. I ordered this one because it is relatively cheap (around $30 CAD) and because if my mum did see it, I could tell her that is just a sports bra.

I ordered a small, which fits me greatly. However, if you are in between sizes, I suggest ordering the size up (so if you were in between a small and a medium, I would order a medium).

I myself am cis-gendered, but I was curious about getting the views of people who do not identify as cis-gendered, or perhaps who identify as non-binary. 

If this is not an appropriate post for this page, please let me know and I will remove it, and I apologize. 

I was curious about a few things. 

What were peoples' feelings about the whole J.K. Rowling situation and the things she said about trans people? 

How do you guys feel about the current representation of trans/non-binary people in books and shows? 

Are there things that you would like to see more of? 

Do you ever see something done in a way that is offensive? Or that you would have done differently?

I wanted to say firstly I'm very grateful for each of you sharing your stories on here. I am a cis female, but recently I've been very passionate about using my medical training and passion for sexual health and women's health to explore ways in which I can educate others. I'm an OBGYN and I'm ashamed to say that I've never had the opportunity to care for trans individuals before but I want to change that. I'm really trying to find ways to help make policy changes to help the trans community and hoping to educate other physicians on some of the more specific needs of the trans community. I am no expert at all when it comes to navigating the obstacles you each face, but I want to be an ally and an advocate!!

I would love to see if any one would be interested in being on an interview for my podcast so that we can create more awareness for the issues of this community.

I would love to have 3-4 stories to share! 

Bonus if you live in Texas and can speak to how our policies here have impacted you.

And double bonus if you yourself are doing any activism or business endeavors that are having a positive impact on your communities.

 I have a mtf friend who told me once she ""yeets the testies"" she won't have to take spiro which 1. I don't know exactly what that is but kinda assumed it was hormones and 2. Is there anything similar for ftm?

B)
Do you get to vaguely pick how extreme you wanna go like very manly or just kinda femboy or is that out of control?

C)
Where can I buy binders that work alright without being like 40$ each? I know I can't get something amazing under 40 but I have fairly low standards, aswell as a fairly low bank account

D)
Who should you contact first in order to get hormones/discuss it? ( I'm in Québec Canada if that helps)

I started wearing nail polish, wearing my hair differently, feminine clothing like yoga pants, which is really comfortable for me. I've experimented with friends online using she/her pronouns for me, and it feels really good.

Milestone: I've (socially-distanced) hung out with a friend a couple times recently and wore yoga pants / nail polish / clips in my hair, which is the first time someone in real life who I know has seen me present this way. I'm pretty sure she got the hint too, although we didn't talk about gender specifically. She pointed out my nail polish and I said I thought it was really cute and thought it looked cool, and she was like ""yeah it is cute/ that does look really cool"". At one point she asked how I feel about my chest hair, and I said I have mixed feelings, and she just said, ""ahhh"" which I assume was her question about whether I have dysphoria and when I said I have mixed feelings about my chest hair, that was my affirmative response.

Mine was a YA novel called Black and Blue Magic. It's about an 11-year old boy whose single mother runs a boarding house in San Francisco. One day he does a favor for a mysterious traveling salesmen. The man thanks him with a vial of pearly ointment that instructs him to put one dab on each shoulderblade.

Doing so causes him to grow feathery white wings from his back, and grants him the ability to fly for a couple of hours. :) He uses it in secret after midnight, jumping out of his window to fly above the city.

Growing up, I marveled at the idea of being able to grow wings and fly. ❤️ I think part of it was about freedom, but it was also about the thought that transforming my body into something or someone else could be possible.

I've always been interested in stories of changing one's form or switching bodies with another person.  And now in retrospect, that was me wishing my own body was different.

2020-08-08 13:07:04,i5ytgi,0,1,"Often I find myself being asked by cis people what it feels like to have dysphoria, and I've never known how to answer, Most of the time I'd say something along the lines of ""shit"" then elaborate by saying I don't know how to articulate the feeling, but also that dysphoria can be different from person to person, so even if I did know how to describe it, I could only speak for myself. Recently I did a series of self portraits for uni that had me look at trans issues to communicate non-mainstream subjects to do with my experiences being trans woman, and because I was thinking visually, I was able to make an image that at least managed to scrape the surface of what dysphoria feels like for me, and I've now found a way to describe it better than I have ever before: if you've ever tried to draw something, especially with anatomy, especially with people and faces, there's a moment once the original sketch is done where you can see all the imperfections ""the eyes are too low, the neck is uneven, the mouth is too flat"" etc. And most of the time you walk away from the work and come back and it looks fine. But that initial feeling of a seemingly endless line of judgement and even disappointment in the picture is kind of like what plays constantly in my mind even without having to see what I'm actually dysphoric about, and it's not exactly and endless stream like the picture, but somehow the feeling each creates links for me. a lot of the time it's relatively minimal, like a soft whisper, but it's always there, until a reflection catches me off guard or something and that whisper consumes me for however long it takes to cool down.

2020-08-09 07:53:43,i6fnjd,1,1,"TW: Mentions suicidal ideation (not graphic)

I never really thought about my gender for the longest time, until recently, and I've been getting inexplicably uncomfortable about who I really am.

As a child, I would tell my female friends that I wanted to be a girl like them because I couldn't stand the way boys behaved and just never felt as though I was really a boy. At the time, and for a long time since, I've told myself that, even if I was trans, that it would just be easier to never experiment, never be mocked for experimenting (I don't have great parents), and never have to potentially face harassment or danger if I am actually trans.

Now, in quarantine, with so much time to myself, I don't know. I've been incredibly depressive lately, with extremely low self-esteem and suicidal ideation. I've called the suicide hotlines multiple times, and, each time, I felt a little better, but only to get me through a couple of days at most before having to call again. (I can't afford therapy; I would absolutely go if I could.)

What I can't get to the bottom of is why I feel this way. I mean, certainly the current state of the world and the fact that we may be on the precipice of fascism (I live in the United States) is something that constantly haunts me, but my depression seems to run deeper. No amount of escapism is able to solve it. And, though I'm a little embarrassed to admit, the show that I watched most recently has many stereotypically girly characters, and I constantly find myself wanting to do certain things that they do, like be platonically really close to a friend or just be vulnerable, which is really hard to do when I'm always just ""a man"". I mean, it's just that I've never actually been vulnerable with anyone before, and my confusion may just be me wanting to get something out, without actually wanting to change my gender.

So for a long time now (definitely a year) I'm starting to feel like my gender identity is more woman. I'm AMAB and have previously used labels as genderfluid, non-binary etc. and even trans feminine. But the last year it has just been one thing: Woman, female, feminine. I'm starting to be more sure of it but I sti got some doubts

Firstly; I don't experience dysphoria nor do I wish to medically transition. I feel very comfortable and at home in my AMAB body. 

Secondly; I prefer and love she/her pronouns but I actually don't mind being called he/him. Is this normal? Men bathrooms are cool for me too. 

Thirdly; DATING. How in the world is that gonna work? Enough said. Every cis straight guy that I've talked to online and knows about my trans identity just wants sex and all that. Is it possible for trans women in general to just experience love? 

I hope I'll find answers soon and maybe gain some wisdom. Bye!

Here’s the problem: though I HATE being called female/she or nonbinary/they, I don’t really feel like I’m male either. It’s the lesser of the evils and makes me the least uncomfortable but it’s still not right. I still feel weird and off when people call me he.
It’s possible part of my hatred of being called they is because the only way people would think I was nonbinary is if they knew I was female, since I dress masc. But still I tried going by they online a few years ago and it felt even worse than she sometimes. 
I have bad chest dysphoria and I know I want top surgery but at the same time I’m dreading having a male-looking chest. The thought of not being on T terrifies me because I’ll always be seen as female/nonbinary, but I’m not at all looking forward to ANY of T’s changes by themselves. It would entirely be to pass. I’ve realised because of quarantine almost all my dysphoria is social, though I don’t remember feeling this way in previous summers/long breaks. 
Part of the discomfort being called he may be because I’m dreading realising I’m not male and having to tell people I essentially lied to them (because I never felt male and just said that so they’d stop calling me she) but it’s always been there. 
I haven’t had any trauma or bad experiences as female. I socially transitioned before I even knew what misogyny was. I have never experienced it in my life. So this isn’t just a terrible case of internalised misogyny/dissociation. When I hear about detransitioners they usually say once they heard others’ stories or thought about it rationally they realised they weren’t trans in a matter of days. It’s been over 6 months and I’m still stuck in this limbo. 
Sometimes I’ll have fleeting moments of “what’s the worst that can happen? I know I’m not female; at most I’ll just be transmasc nonbinary.” but it quickly goes away and I’m right back here. 
I’d cancel the HRT appointment, but if I later realise I DO want it, I’ll have to wait another 2 years before trying again since my parents are very on the fence and if I waver at all they’ll go back to misgendering and deadnaming me.
I can’t bear to go back to school next year not on T and not passing as male. But sitting here alone in my room, I can’t bear to start it either.

As of late, i have been very conflicted with some things, and am hoping to get some advice.  


\- First is, is this normal? I feel very feminine, never masc. but at the same time i am not at all attracted to certain types of men, muscly, or hairy. I like other femboys, or boys that look a little more feminine, and females (I consider myself bi). I am pretty much 100% a bottom or sub, so it just feels a little weird to only like other feminine people as most of them tend to be also more of bottoms or subs, correct me if im wrong.  


\-Second is, I have also been thinking lately, am I trans? or just really feminine.. The past month or so ive been thinking alot about if im actually transgender, alot of the time i feel like i want to actually be a girl instead of a boy. But at the same time, im a little put off of the thought of surgery if i wanted to yknow, change down there.. I have high anxiety and i have never had surgery before so it freaks me out a little, and i get worries about ""what if it doesnt look good"" or ""what if it doesnt work how i want it"". I do want to figure it out soon though because if i am trans i want to go through with that lifestyle change before im older and it wont work as well if you know what i mean.  


\-Some side notes. My parents arent against me feeling feminine, i havent really talked to them about a scenario where i am transgender or if i want to get feminine clothes. Im sure they would be supportive of either though. Also i live in a low income house and am not sure if our insurance would cover something like hrt and that kinda thing (We have Mainecare as our insurance)

(Obligatory sorry-on-mobile)

My husband's longest/closest friend came out as trans about a week ago. We've been sending out love and support, but as she's in another state I've been feeling unable to offer real support.
I got the idea of sending her a gift box of traditionally feminine things, as I know she doesn't have much atm.
I was thinking some nice skin care items, nail polish, and maybe some simple jewelery...but I don't know what else!
I'd love any suggestions or advice! Anyone who has transitioned - were there any key items that helped you feel more feminine in your early stages of transitioning?

So I'm slowly coming out to certain people. I am 23 mtf, I have a consult in 5 days to hopefully start hrt. I decided I want to tell a few certain people now, so I know where our relationship stands. I started with my gf of 2 years yesterday. She was very receptive and listened for an hour and a half while I explained everything to her. She told me she loves me and supports me, but after a while told me she didn't know if she'd be interested in a relationship with a trans person. We left it at that and I'm still not sure what to do there. I am 100% going to transition physically and socially, so I can either end it or wait until she does. So that sucks.

On a more positive note, I told a longtime friend today who also happens to be the first person I told I'm bisexual 3 years ago when we were roommates. Convo went like this:

Me: You remember that thing I told you about me when we were living together?
Her: Yeah, why?
Me: Well apparently that wasn't all of it...I'm trans. Surprise!
Her: 🤣 not surprised at all

She explained to me that while I've always had a hyper masculine look and lifestyle (long beard, big truck, ex army infantry) she could tell something was different just in the way we vibed.

I don't know why but there was just something so reassuring in her telling me she saw it before I did. And while I may be a little heartbroken by what I know is coming with my gf, I feel extremely validated, and I know everything is gonna be fine.

Is it possible for me to be a true trans boy, even if these feelings weren't strongly there in my childhood/adolescence?
(Not saying I felt ""feminine"" either though.)

I‘m 25 years old and have just over the last year or so started to find out that I’m not comfortable with presenting and being referred to as a man. I’ve tried the tiniest bits of makeup here and there, wore a dress and a skirt once respectively, and I always felt so much better instantly. Also, I love it so much that my girlfriends nickname for me is “Princess”, that just feels good, too.

So now I want to explore that further, to get to know myself. But I’m rather introverted. 
Does anyone here have some advice where to start? Can you recommend YouTube channels or blogs or any resource on how make-up works, especially on masculine faces to make them more feminine? And that also explains the real dumb basics, because I’ve never done Make-up in myself before except for lipstick? 😅
And kind of the same for clothes? Any sources that you’ve found helpful to find a style, find out what women’s sizes fit and so on?
Also, any tips on things I could do and try to explore myself are really welcome! I know so little and am so curious and have no idea where to really start ☺️

I am also bi so attraction to others isn't really a problem, but I recently came out as bi and ever since I'm scared to change or add anything to my label. My parents are supportive I feel like they are supportive as long as I dont speak about it or let anything hint to me being bi. 

I kind of want to be a different person but being trans also brings a lot of hate. I dont know if I can handle that and I really dont know if I want to have the surgeries. I really hate my upper body but I can live with what's down there...

Hi there beautiful people! Today I have made a way for me to monitor my feelings towards me being a transgender. To do this I have composed a list on all the things that are functioning as an incentive for me to become Trans and a list with reasons why I am not Trans: my trans scale! I am a kind of person that believes in pure logic and sometimes I get a little stubborn in my vision of 'black and white'. So this scale is a result of that. 

How it works is that I periodically make these lists with topics and grade them through 0 to 10 depending on how I feel that day. Hopefully this will help me make up my mind and hopefully, it helps yours.

Some guidelines for using this scale:
- only count the scores after you're done. This is to avoid pushing either one of them depending on what you want the outcome to be. It should be a honest representation of how you feel!
- don't worry too much about the outcome. It's a periodic test and not a tool, not a solution.
- The scale should be personalised.
- try your best to get as many + as -. To avoid unbalanced results (I didn't manage to do that)

Some explanations on my scale that I feel need to be mentioned:

-Work: I aspire to become skilled in a field of psychology called: 'Social Engineering'. Roughly said it is the art of manipulation where you, the social engineer, try to gain access to a company physically. This is to test out the (physical and I guess mental) security of a company. For example I have to try if I can just walk right into a workshop wearing similar clothing and see if I can either steal something or do something. This is really rough and I don't hope I offend people that know every bit of the art as this is only how I can push it into a job. With that boring description out of the way, I explain why it's red: one of the things that help you tremendously with your Social Engineering, is to be 'normal' (how stupid it may be) anything that looks out of the ordinary draws attention and that's just not what you want. 
- 'The Road': The road means the process of transition. Pretty self-explanatory. 

This scale is also new for me so I expect to tweak it myself later on, hopefully you like the aspect of it and hopefully it can help you out! 

Peace!

TW: dysphoria, long-ass rants

Quarantine has given me crippling dysphoria, or I’m just more aware of it ever since spending more time on reddit (subs like egg_irl...fuck that place for making me think about myself! Kidding). Anyway, it’s terrible. I hate my chest, I hate wearing bras, I hate how high my voice is, I hate that people see me as a “girl”, and most of all, I hate my long hair (but my family won’t let me cut it).

Basically, I hate myself. I have a history of depression and I feel numb all the time.

Today, I told my mom I wanted to see a therapist, but I was too scared to tell her why. My parents aren’t too bad (i think my mom will support me even if she doesn’t understand...my dad is worse about LGBT stuff, very republican even though he’s an intelligent man)— at any rate, I think they’ll support me. My brother is terrible and once went on a tirade about trans people for no reason at all; thankfully, he doesn’t live with us, but he’ll find out eventually.

Anyway, I’m so scared to tell her the truth about why I want to see a therapist because I don’t want them to see me differently. I don’t want them to be disgusted by me or hate me or think I’m a different person. But I’m suffering so badly, I cry all the time, it’s like my depression episode except 1000000 times worse. I need to go see one but I don’t know what to say and I don’t know if she’ll get me an appointment if i don’t give her a concrete reason. As far as they know,
i’m a cishet, albeit depressed, girl.

Help?!? Thoughts?!? Shit’s fucked. I live in a town of &gt;10,000. There’s nowhere I can go queer-friendly wise.

I’m now 13 months on T and have just changed from depo-T to Reandron. I never had any IBS whatsoever before, very happy gut. 

Just wondering if anyone else had this issue during HRT? Or the opposite? Whether FtM or MtF I don’t know if it’s the T exactly. 

I’m hoping that maybe it’s less about testosterone and more that my body is just freaking out with the hormonal changes and therefore it might settle down when the puberty part of HRT is over, like acne. 

Any anecdotes or thoughts would be great.

And yes, I have spoken to my doctor and endo about it. They say it shouldn’t be related to hrt but offer no other explanation and said there is no treatment :( I’m finding it very debilitating and it’s really ruining what is otherwise a pretty manageable transition.

2020-08-11 09:55:15,i7oz2g,6,1,"Hi ! First off if this is insensitive or not allowed in any way please please delete my post because the last thing I want is to be rude or overstep in a space that’s not mine.

I am not transgender myself, but I’m creating a comic where the protagonist is MtF. While Ash’s gender is certainly not the focus of the comic, I want it to be as accurate as possible, so I need to understand where issues may arise that I haven’t thought of myself because I’m not transgender.

So, I have a few questions that I’d really appreciate some guidance on if possible (:


	
1 ) the premise of the plot is that Ash gets transported into a medieval fantasy world. From what I know part of the process of transitioning involves taking injections of the hormone to get your bodies hormone level to the right levels of the gender you present as. So that’s oestrogen for Ash, right ?
Ash wouldn’t have access to any of those drugs in this world. Would she, visually, turn back into the appearance of a male over several years ? Or is there a stage where the process of taking these injections is ‘complete’, and you are biologically 100% that gender, and don’t need any more injections ??

That leads me onto question number 2 ) is there an age restriction for these types of things ? Ash begins my comic as 12, and I was planning for her to have already had her penectomy. Is that super unrealistic ? What about the hormone treatment, would that have an age restriction too ?



I do have in-universe ways to realistically work around #2, but I would still like to know so I can implement those workarounds. #1 is currently my biggest concern. I may be very wrong here, but from what I’ve heard taking those injections can alter your face shape / body structure etc. I’m worried that if she’d had to stop taking them her body structure would shift back to looking more male or something ? Sorry, I really know very little about this part of the process. I’m further researching but thought I’d ask here too (:

I'm planning on telling my head band director, (who I meet tomorrow,) my pronouns and chosen name. This though, also means telling my dad.

Essentially,  I have less than 24 hours to come out as trans to my dad, even though I'm 80% sure he's going to tell me not to put labels on anything yet. Neither of my parents are transphobic, and they both know I'm questioning, but the difference between my mom and my dad is that I've already had that really long and uncomfortable conversation with my mother, and we've come to a sort of mutual, unspoken understanding to not mention anything about it until we can both get our shit sorted in therapy.

With my dad on the other hand, coming out to him also means coming out to his girlfriend and her family. Plus, we had a conversation similar to this, when I came out the first time and told him I liked girls. I never said I was a lesbian, and he made sure that I knew that he supported me, but didn't want me using labels, as I could never be certain. 

That's the big issue with me coming out as trans. I'm not, and won't be until I actually tell him, certain that's how he'll react, but knowing him it will be. I know he'll love and support me no matter what, but I'm just... scared. I'm literally about to throw up while typing this, and I've been ignoring it for weeks because every time I think about telling him I get nauseous.

2020-08-12 06:45:53,i88xl6,6,1,"Hey friends!

So, I apologize in advance if this has been previously asked on this sub a million times, or if it's not the appropriate place to ask, or if the question itself seems inappropriate and tonedeaf, but I've been genuinely curious for a while.

This mostly relates to Twitter because it's where I see it most often pop up, but it happens on IG too. Cis person's who declare their pronouns in their profiles, and it matching their sex, such as cis males as he/him/himself, and cis females as she/her/herself.

I've tried to be an ally for civil rights across the board my entire adult life, but I'm apprehensive to get on board with things that feel not genuine, and pandering, because I don't support civil rights as a means to be cool and own some ""I'm totally not a bigot"" card. It matters to me. So when I see cis folks like myself, especially political candidates and figures and politicians posting pronouns in this sort of fashion, it feels pandering to me, and it feels insulting. Like it's just a thing to get hip with the right side of history so you have the ""I'm totally not a bigot"" card - almost an appropriation.

So that's kind of my question. To me, a declaration of pronouns is something that exists for people who identify as a gender other than what they were assigned, or random people believe they are because they ""look male"" or ""look female"" - to help people who are otherwise innocently ignorant and get it wrong. Am I batting wrong with this line of thinking? Not to make trans people to be some kind of monolith, but generally speaking does it seem like people who identify as trans prefer that cis people declare their pronouns publicly, or does it come off as pandering and/or appropriating?

I ask because I want to wash my own ignorance, and hopefully be able to help educate friends who might not know many or any trans person's.

Google says that the word is ""denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex"". So if I was raised as a girl in spite of my intersex condition (which my parents didn't know of at the time of birth, but found out about before I began identifying as nonbinary), does 'transitioning' to a nonbinary identity make me cisgender? Since nonbinary seems more aligned with my birth sex than female.

However, it could be said that simply identifying as nonbinary doesn't exactly make me 'in line' with my birth sex either, since there's no gender specifically assigned to intersex people, or differing by which intersex condition they have. So is it possible that I'm neither trans nor cisgender?

2020-08-13 07:41:48,i8vnzx,5,1,"So I am a white currently male (physically) 20 year old in California, and I just told my family I am transgender and pansexual. They accepted the pansexual thing fairly easily, they were confused what it meant but I told them it's basically Bi and if they think that's what it is I'm ok with that.

The Bombshell however was telling them I was trans. 

So I told some of my friends a few days ago, some of which are also trans, and I have been getting support from them before telling my family. They were super cool and even tried calling me she/her and Zoe. One friend in particular made me feel amazing because as I came out to her she started texting her boyfriend about it and then sent me a screenshot saying, ""my friend from high school just decided she's trans so I'm so proud of her :) and she told me like second I feel special."" Honestly I love this message and already have viewed it several times.

Anyways I tried hinting to my family by growing out my hair, suggesting shaving my legs, and also body language but it never really got through to them, and thus me telling them hit like a bombshell. Now my brother was super cool with this and although was a bit concerned is totally understanding and didn't freak out. My dad also stayed calm like me, but my mom freaked a bit. 

So for starters my mom is confused about gender and sex being a spectrum, which I admittedly also think can be confusing in general. However, she was confused about way someone would ""transition halfway there"" instead going fully female or male. I tried explaining to her there could be many reasons with it being a spectrum, not binary, but I think she really doesn't see it like that. She also took issue with me not exploring myself, like never kissing anyone or having a girl/boyfriend, but I think that's more about being pansexual than transgender. 

They also think I am being influenced by social media and the trans community which I tried to disprove to them but to no avail. I really don't use social media often, and only have 2 trans friends who btw didn't even do anything to suggest me being trans, I told them on my own and not even first. I know the irony of making a reddit post on r/trans but this is literally my first reddit post EVER.

They also think I shouldn't talk to friends about this, but that's my support system so I told them I'm still gonna talk to them about it. They have been great and even try to call me she/her and Zoe. They don't always but earlier today I even called myself Ethan to which we all laughed cuz it was funny. 

They also want mean to see someone like a therapist, which I think is fair, because they don't want me rushing this. My mom kept saying see someone to check your head, or something along those lines, which may sound awful but she was also fairly flustered and admitted she didn't mean for it to come out like that.

I guess I'm just making this post because Coming Out Story I guess? Also I am interested in what you guys have to say about this, or any advice?

Let me start off by saying I am not trans(I think) but I am a man who likes to crossdress(the crossdressing subreddit doesn't let me post anything, I guess I would have to get permission first). I thought you would probably be the best community to ask how to best get rid of both bodily and facial hair. I have used epilators for body hair removal but it hurts quite a lot and gives me lasting blisters and skin irritation. I have tried a ball trimmer since then as they don't hurt and give almost the same result. However I am sure there are easier solutions out there and my ball trimmer unfortunately stopped working. I looked into electrolysis but since I am not trans I am somewhat uncomfortable to permanently get my hair removed. It would be helpfull to know what best works for you.

An even bigger and the main issue however is facial hair. For facial hair it seems very hard to remove the parts of hair below the skin which are easily spottable as I have quite fair skin and dark facial hair and epilators are obviously out of the question. I have seen one ""solution"" but it doesn't actually remove the hair and simply involves putting layers of expensive makeup on top of it. Again your advice would be welcomed.

Seems like I am quite attractive when I crossdress as I already got asked out by a guy on my 3rd time crossdressing.

Then 12 hours before the surgery, the doctors office called to tell me they fucked up, and gave insurance the wrong info, so it was cancelled. That was the first time my mother shocked me...she was pissed that they would even do that to me, get me excited that this change was coming, and then let me down last minute.  I just had top surgery this Monday (08/10/2020), and I am just in pure shock. My mom has been there hand and foot for me. Every meal, every medicine time, every time I needed something different. She even took off work. This is something she never wanted me to have done. I never really explained to her what ftm is and how I’m male. And mom my NEVER EVER takes off work for anything. \n\nLong story short: sometimes people do surprise you.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I had ftm top surgery Monday, and my mom has genuinely shocked me', 'created': 1597361020.0}"

The first thing is cake out to my friends and family about being trans and everyone was accepting, which made me really really happy! Another thing is that it’s been 4 months since I started HRT and I’m so happy about it!

2020-08-14 21:33:04,i9utgk,5,1,"Over the last few days I've been heavily questioning my gender identity. I used to think that I was your typical straight guy until I learned that everyone else was actually actively trying to have sex and romantic relationships. Long story short over the past months I've come to realize that I'm asexual and aromantic. 

I did a lot of soul searching while figuring out my sexual and romantic orientation and noticed that I had internalized quite a lot of toxic masculinity. I also used to subconsciously try to present 'manly' i.e. suppressing emotions, being 'cool' and crap like that. For years I've been in the process of learning that I shouldn't just accept the self image that I feel like society imposes on me and this was a major step forward. 

That was when I started to try and listen to what my inner self actually wanted. Over the course of a few weeks I started shaving my legs and painting my nails and I cut open an old pair of pants to sew myself a skirt.  
I also noticed that I would rather be seen as female because I always thought that males were not supposed to show and talk about feelings while females are (I do realize that this is wrong, I've since then talked about my feelings on multiple occasions and that feeling that I want to be seen as female because of these reasons isn't nearly as strong anymore).

I finally informed myself about the different gender identities and learned that people usually feel a clear connection to their respective gender. The only thing connecting me to my agab was that I was just used to being seen as male. If I was just an immaterial conscience I probably wouldn't have a gender. I also (think I) wouldn't really care if people used she/her pronouns instead of him/his and I feel like they are pretty interchangeable. That's why I decided to use the agender label.

So here's where the confusion begins (anew). I usually like to go commando but I quickly realized that that wasn't going to work with a skirt and male genitals. I was curious and so I bought a pack of panties which I find to be pretty comfortable (definitely more comfortable than male underwear). When I wore panties for the first time I simultaneously felt good because I looked girly and I was extremely self-conscious about my genitals. I'd love to be able to just retract them and have a flat and feminine groin.

That was a few days ago and I've since been thinking about how I feel about my body. I've read a bit about HRT and SRS and while I kinda like the idea of having a more feminine body I'm not 100% sure if I  would want to have medically induced changes. What I do know is that if I had the chance I'd definitely swap my body cause I want to know how it feels to be female and if I prefer that (in your typical ""You can be a different sex for a day, what do you do?"" kind of scenario).

So, dear binary trans folks, how do you know? Do you have a distinct feeling that tells you what gender you are? Am I maybe just curious how it would feel like being female because I've been male all my life? Or maybe a little bit genderflux switching between agender and somewhat female/male?

While this comparison was performed  retrospectively and was not part of the original research question given  that several other factors may differ between the groups, the results  demonstrated no advantage of surgery in relation to subsequent mood or  anxiety disorder-related health care visits or prescriptions or  hospitalizations following suicide attempts in that comparison. Given  that the study used neither a prospective cohort design nor a randomized  controlled trial design, the conclusion that “the longitudinal  association between gender-affirming surgery and lower use of mental  health treatment lends support to the decision to provide  gender-affirming surgeries to transgender individuals who seek them” is  too strong.

And to cut a long story short....I wrote a poem to kind of sum up how my thoughts have changed over the past year. I am not a poet so I apologise in advance but here goes.....

The thought of an ending

Have you ever had the thought of an ending?
A messy and drastic rending
A quick drop
A sudden stop
Then what?

A brake from the noise?
No longer feeling like toys?
Toys to be tossed around
A discarded rag in the lost and found
We sometimes see the world in black and white
Our mind so bent and broken by the fight 
That we forget that colour runs deep
And sometimes the only brightness is in our sleep

Have you ever had the thought of an ending?
Perhaps a silent and peaceful spending
Of your lights last bill
On that final pill
Then what?

Will the voices stop?
Will the reaper come to collect his crop?
A crop of hollow and empty souls
To bake his bread of unpaid tolls
They forget with their happy minds
That there are those of us that struggle with our binds
In the dark where our forgotten voices cry
And the rest of the world passes us by

Have you ever had the thought of an ending?
Maybe a single step and a rapid descending
Is it an embrace of waves
Your mind craves 
Then what?

Then will they no longer ask
Why you stand there with your broken mask
A mask of forced smiles
And faked laughs laying in piles
They will likely never see 
The real you, or the real me
What will be said when we fade away?
That we found it to painful to stay?

I have had the thought of an ending
Of this fool proof way of defending
Myself from all the hurt
Wouldn't I be much happier in the dirt?
To this day
The ferry man I plan to pay
But the day I will take that trip
Is still a far off distant blip
Because yes recently I have been tending
To have the thought of an ending
And when all is said and done
I hope that it’s a happy one

2020-08-15 06:17:57,ia2gvc,7,1,"Hi everybody, first time posting in this subreddit and feeling a bit nervous.

I'm 25 and up until recently I've never really questioned my gender, I've generally felt okay with being male. However, I've always hated how masculine I looked and wished that I was more petite/short/thin etc. (I'm 6ft-ish and pretty broad).
The past several months, though, I've found myself becoming increasingly uncomfortable being perceived as male by default.

I'm not sure if any of this would be defined as gender dysphoria but here are some of the things I've been experiencing lately:

- Feeling bummed out when customers at my job call me sir. This is probably one of the most prominent ones, it really bothers me and it used to not.

- Becoming uncomfortable with my body hair/beard and wanting to shave it all off.

- Looking down at my hands when I'm using my phone, typing on my computer, etc and wishing my nails were long and painted. Also just generally wishing my hands weren't so manly.

- Wanting to wear/experiment with makeup. I've always watched a lot of makeup/drag videos and lately I find myself wanting to wear makeup but am terrified to do so in public.

- Wanting to grow my hair out really long.

That's mostly it, basically I'm curious if this is gender dysphoria and how trans people typically experience gender dysphoria. I have this internal ache to start presenting more femininely just to feel comfortable with myself but I'm so terrified. I don't know if I'm ready for a label yet.

Sorry if this post doesn't make sense, this is just something that has been weighing on me for awhile and I've never spoken to anyone about it. I really just need some advice on where to go from here.

I’ve asked a similar thing on the trans guy/trans masc subs but I’m curious in general. I’m trans masc and non-binary. On t, have had top surgery. I experience dysphoria and also euphoria around gender 

I never grew up thinking I was a boy or knowing I was. I accepted I was a girl 

I started binding at 19 and it felt great. Cutting my hair short felt great (obvi anyone can have short hair though).

Due to dysphoria i have kept expecting that one day I will realise I am a guy. You hear about very young trans children who can say what their true gender is. I’ve waited for this realisation to come for like... 11 years? 

When random people think I’m a guy, it’s a relief. This is cos at work and when doing things like applying for rentals, I am concerned about discrimination if people know I’m non-binary or trans in general 

I lived as a butch/genderqueer person and not on T during my 20s. 

I hate being treated in a sexist way of course, but generally I like interacting in the world as someone who is seen as a gnc woman. I don’t get dysphoric from that.

\- I noticed that a binder looks a bit like an undershirt. Is it possible it can be seen while wearing it?  
\- How can I wash my binder if the washing machine is too risky to use?

\- Can I wear a binder at work if they are small shifts? I work in a restaurant, so at the peak of summer this is out of the question. In quieter months with short shifts, is it OK to bind?

I hope I'm in the right community, but I'm a little unsure. If you feel my posting is not fitting with this sub I'll understand.

I'm 32, male, cis, mostly hetero. I began a relationship with my current partner, when he was still closeted and presenting female, although tomboyish about two years ago. 

My partner, 25, has come out as... well, he's still very unsure about it all. He identifies as NB, but prefers male pronouns (there is no gender neutral pronoun in our native language). He also identifies as trans and has slowly come to the conclusion that he mostly likes women. He's thinking about starting a testosterone therapy. 

My impression is that he's in a very confusing stage of transitioning out of his former life as someone who was always seen as a woman.

So my question: how can I help him with all this? I love him and want the best for him. I've read a few transition stories, but mostly it seems that people are not in a relationship when they transition. Did any of you transition while in a relationship?

There stands a centurion, his shoulders are squared.
His scutom is raised, his gladius bared.
He seeks neither glory, nor spoils of war,
He batters the wolves away from her door.

There stands a Centurion, virile and strong,
But he's growing so weary, he's battled so long.
Sworn to defend til his moment of death,
He'll guard and protect her to his last dying breath.

Behind her walls, she hides in disgrace, 
She feels the pain of each arrow, each blow to his face.
His body is broken, yet despite the pain, 
He rises to guard her again and again.

The moment has come, no more shall she hide,
While her avatar's beaten and battered outside.
As he falls to his knees, in his place she now stands,
A sword of her own, gleams in her hands.

2020-08-18 15:22:48,ic30om,3,1,"Hey guys  💙   


So I am sure a lot of you are in the same boat, but I am trying to figure out if/when I should come out as mtf at work. I have been weighing all the variables and am trying to find a good statistical probability of fired or not fired based on my trans status. Firstly, as of right now I am 100% reliant on this job, if I lose it I could be homeless very easily. I am working to change that and am working to find a good backup in case the worst happens, but I am not there yet.  


So here are the variables:  


I live in Texas, a very conservative ""right to work"" state. ""Right to work"" is a misnomer, it merely means you can leave a job for any reason or be terminated for any reason with no recourse. It's good old conservative corporate worship at it's finest, and basically a loophole companies in conservative states use to get rid of racial and sexual minorities.   


I work for a company (let's call them Company A) that does IT contracting. I am a contractor, but the company I contract to (we'll call them Company B) is not my employer and does not sign my checks (Company A does that).  From what I have been told, Company A is trans-friendly. Though my non-binary friend was laid off from a contract for being trans. Of course the company they were contracted to trumped-up some non-sense because it's a right to work state, but the real reason was discrimination. The contract is the one who fired them, not Company A. They got another contract and stay employed with Company A until their contract was bought out by their current employer.  


Good news is, the contract I am on is doing helpdesk for the County of San Diego. A government gig in a one of (if not \*the\*) most liberal states in America. Bad news is that San Diego County is actually contracting to Company B in Maryland, and THEY are who I am contracting to.   


So basically I work for Company A, who contracts me to Company B as a subcontractor for San Diego County.   


Both Maryland and California have very strict anti-discrimination laws, but since I am actually employed in a Texas-based company, I don't know if I am protected or not. I don't expect the San Diego government to have an issue, but Company B is still a corp and I don't trust them, and if they wanted me gone for being trans I am not sure if they could take advantage of very loose antidiscrimination laws of Texas, or still be bound to Maryland's law in regards to an out of state contractor.  


So what do you guys think? How likely is it that this will bite me in the butt if I come out?",trans,What are *my* chances to be fired for transitioning?,1597789368.0,"{'created_utc': 1597764168, 'id': 'ic30om', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey guys  💙   \n\n\nSo I am sure a lot of you are in the same boat, but I am trying to figure out if/when I should come out as mtf at work.

I don\'t expect the San Diego government to have an issue, but Company B is still a corp and I don\'t trust them, and if they wanted me gone for being trans I am not sure if they could take advantage of very loose antidiscrimination laws of Texas, or still be bound to Maryland\'s law in regards to an out of state contractor.  \n\n\nSo what do you guys think?

2020-08-18 15:53:52,ic3m7j,2,1,"Hi everyone,

My name is James Kicklighter, and I'm the director of *The Sound of Identity.*

It’s the extraordinary story of the first transgender opera singer in history to perform as *Don Giovanni* in a mainstage opera. Set in Oklahoma, one of America’s reddest states, the film follows the high stakes journey of [Lucia Lucas](https://lucialucas.de/) and her mentor, legendary Opera composer [Tobias Picker](http://tobiaspicker.com/), as she tackles the title role in Mozart’s masterpiece.  

Our film skips right past the topic of transition. 

I felt that often in media, this is the only portrayal audiences get of the Trans community, and it is far past time to shift that narrative to tell different kinds of stories.

If you live in Florida, you can see it this weekend at [OUTShine](https://outshinefilm.com/films/info/1319/the-sound-of-identity) and in Georgia at [the Macon Film Festival](https://mpv.tickets.com/?agency=GRAND_OP_MPV&amp;orgid=21335&amp;pid=8855547). We will be everywhere later in the year.

I am so proud of this film, and I hope it will make you all proud too.

2020-08-18 16:55:40,ic4tgy,5,1,"Good evening everyone,  
to clarify some things:   
1. The story is about Stefany.  
2. HIM/HE or different male pronouns are about Stefany. This is intentional.  
3. My questions will be in the end, please understand.

So, it was a few weeks ago on a weekend. Stefany and I were at my home, drunk as F and he started talking. You know, on first sight Stefany resembles a normal man around the age of 30. You will NEVER see a female in his bodyshape, nor in his behaviour nor where ever you want. You will watch him doing all his duties and work as you expect. If needed he will fight you with all force and after that he will drink very much with you in a bar nearby.

Unknowingly to almost all people around, he is living a double life. Everytime he comes home and is left alone on his own, he will ""transform"" himself into a female. As far I know, he has got several clothing, like tons of underwear, tights, shirts, shorts, even a very cute dress. He will do it almost daily, ""enjoying my every clothing I bought"", especially after a hard day with customer work when he can rest. On the night we drunk he stated: ""Working with people makes me exhausted very fast and I just change myself into the female me and feel like a different person."" 

I asked if he has considered any possibility to be a transgender or whatever, he shrugged and said ""I do not know, I don't feel like one. It is more like being Superman, switching between characters."" We drank some more and I asked who would know about his secret. As far I know he only came out to a therapist, to a bunch of ""friends"" (which I know did never believe him and still call him by the male name to this day while hanging around) and he attempted a come out on a former class mate, but she simply sent him off with ""f\*\*\* you and go joke around somewhere else!"". He would never ever come out to a family member or some other people. I do not know if he is just afraid or if there is more.

I am maybe one of the people above who knows the full story but I do not care much about it. What ever he dresses on, it is his business. Of course he has shown me his clothing and other stuff I shall not write here. I mean just imagine a male bodybuilder in female soft light clothes.. It is hard, believe me. I saw many pics here and somewhere else where trans are shown, he is not even going to be close to you and your beauty all! (Imagine a typical 2m x 2m x 2m seargent dressed in a miniskirt?) I shrugged this fashion show of, since I dont care.  
In the end of our meeting we were totally wasted, when he asked me: ""What do you think about me? Am I a girl, or a boy? I do not know who I am."" I simply stated ""I do not know either."" This was somehow our last ""intelligeable"" conversation and I only remember how he tried to sort his underwear by colour (as if you can do it totally wasted). In conclusion, we went to sleep and he forgot about what he has told and asked me that night. He was totally embarassed that he was half naked, all his clothes and stuff were lying around (yes! actually cute stuff!) but alcohol seemed to erase the last conversation we hat. I left him in the morning so he could be ""her"" and left it at that.

Days and weeks later I feel kinda feel weird and bad that he kinda lives in a contradiction of his feelings and thoughs. Remember? When sober he said he doesnt feel to be a trans but drunk doesnt know who he is.   
I mean, I shrugged of his ""fashion show"", I dont mind all his clothes what ever he wears, I dont care what state he is in at home or outside. I am even not intrested in him as a bisexuall. But it bothers me that he is not able to tell what he is,  And I am not able to tell him too. I still refer to him as male, he doesnt mind but still..   


Please tell me, is this life a sign for being a trans? Is it double personality?   
I wish to help him a bit but I cant. Stefany does not know me writing this, so there is a chance that through your kind help I might help him.",trans,"Him, Stefany - a story of unknown (warning, long text)",1597794940.0,"{'created_utc': 1597769740, 'id': 'ic4tgy', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Good evening everyone,  \nto clarify some things:   \n1.

2020-08-18 19:55:10,ic8dk1,2,1,"Hello!

I didn't really know where else to come for this information, so here I am!  
A little bit of context: My best friend came out as non-binary to me about 6-7 months ago, which is awesome! What is less awesome is that they have un-supporting parents, and so don't have access to certain things. They've been wanting a binder for a while, and since they've been a super big help in my own gender mess, I wanted to get them something. So, as the title suggests, I've thought about getting them a binder.

First off, is that something acceptable to buy as a gift, especially if it's their first one?

Secondly, if it IS acceptable, are there measurements I'd have to take? If so, how would I get them without seeming suspicious? I also can't really see them IRL right now because of COVID concerns, so I'd have to swindle them out of their measurement without them realizing.

Finally, are there brands or specific types that would be good for someone's first binder? 

Thank you so much, and have a nice day :)",trans,Binders as a gift,1597805710.0,"{'created_utc': 1597780510, 'id': 'ic8dk1', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hello!\n\nI didn't really know where else to come for this information, so here I am!  \nA little bit of context: My best friend came out as non-binary to me about 6-7 months ago, which is awesome!

Would it be appropriate if I were to ask him what pronouns he prefers? Obviously I will respect whatever the answer may be. They/them, he/him, she/her, any combination of the above, or anything else one can think of! 

Also, are there certain questions that I should ask, or should avoid asking? He’s a really wonderful addition to our team and I want to make sure he feels accepted just the way he is!

""You'll always be pretty to me."" 

Since then I completely tossed it all aside... I really wish I could just move out of my small town and change to a new environment, it would make this a lot easier. 

I just don't know if I can come out of the closet like I want to. 

It doesn't help that my family is Native, and long hair means a lot to me. I dont mean to sound narcissistic, because I don't agree with it. But I know I'm called attractive a lot as a female, and I can already see myself being shamed at work.

Mind you my best friend and I have two friends on hormones who are working on transitioning, that's why this next bit really fucked me up. My friend told me, ""I'm not going to call J she because *he* looks like a man."" 

I told her that's not okay and that at the very least say they, she then said, ""I'm not going to call *it* they.""

This threw me for a massive fucking loop. I tired to explain to her that she would never do that to our friends Alex and Destiny so why would you to J. She wasn't hearing it and said, ""it just doesn't make sense.""

2020-08-20 20:48:17,idikmn,2,1,"Hi all! I apologize if this is the wrong sub for me to post this. I figured it’s probably the best place for me to hear transgender voices, so I may as well try! 
Currently, I’m in the process of conceptualizing a story. I haven’t decided quite yet whether it’s going to be a comic or a book, but I do know I have an idea and I’ll put it into paper one way or another. The main story being told is about two girls attending a summer camp who look for a monster in the forest and fall in love. This is a really vague description and I’d be happy to elaborate if asked, but it’s not crucial information. 

One of the secondary main characters, the protagonist’s best friend, is a transgender girl. I previously had most of her character established, but it’s come to my attention that I may be perpetuating some harmful tropes and stereotypes in her writing. I created the character when I was a bit younger and (as a cis kid with a few trans friends) still had a very flawed understanding of what it means to be transgender. 

So, I’d like to request something of a test-reader (I can’t remember the actual term) to help me write a more accurate trans teen. I need someone who can help me to write the character going through her transition and how it may affect her life. 
Some specific things I need help with are: 
1) Creating an accurate portrayal of what transitioning is like for trans women/teens
2) Learning how trans kids in foster care may be affected by their living situation 
3) Knowing what trans girls may have difficulty with, such as trouble passing or dysphoria
4) Knowing what exploitative tropes to avoid writing, even if my intentions aren’t to perpetuate stereotypes. 

I understand this is a bit of a tall order and I deeply appreciate anyone who takes the time to comment on this post or message me. Above all, I want to make sure this character is a accurate representation of trans women. Feel free to ask questions or drop advice! Even if you don’t feel up to working with me long term, I’d love to hear your tidbits of wisdom.

So, i'm not 100% if this is the right sub, but this is all i could find on Reddit.  
I'm Male and live on Brazil, and while i'm not part of the LGBTQ+ community, i support it and find it good that people are making changes that make them good with themselves.   
I have two problems: First, i never really had any Trans friends, i had Gay/Lesbian friends, but not really Transgender, and second: I'm from Brazil, we speak portuguese, a language that is not very kind on gender-neutral pronouns, we have ELE (He), Ela (She), Eles (He but in plural, They in masculine or that can be used as a neutral one), Elas (She but in plural, They in feminine), and that is mostly it.  
While ELES (They) can be used for gender-neutral, ELES is plural, that means that it is used for multiple people.   
We really don't have a pronoun that can be used to one singular person that is either: Trans, Non-binary, Asexual, and many others. And that is what it makes me anxious, now, I know my friend from a online game, They don't have any problems with me calling them she (Their character is a female one), and while i don't really know 100% if i should specify them as She/He (did never ask.. i'm dumb...), Sometimes i got confused and a lot of pronouns are used almost interchangeably because my confusion. They know i'm only confused and that i don't have any malicious intent, and just laughs about it.  
I heard that They/Them can be used, but it hits very hard on my head because They on Portuguese is Eles (Plural, Masculine pronoun, that can be used as gender-neutral if multiple people are on a situation and they are not from the same sex), and in School/High school, i never had anyone teaching us what to do in those situations...  
If anyone can help me with that, i'm thankful... I'm kinda scared of losing someone like a friend in the future because i don't know what to do in those situations and can be rude in their eyes...  


PS²: If i did any Typos, or did write anything that can be interpreted the wrong way, i'm sorry... It's really hard living 20 years without having any friends that identify themselves as another gender than their born one... And i don't know if i'm being offensive in any way or form...

I'm kinda having a hard time atm and realized that the media I consume in my free time doesn't really help with that...  
A lot of people here seem to be into Anime and talk about how it helped them with feeling better about themselves, so I thought I ask you if you have some recommendations for a beginner :P  
I only knew Dragonball and One Piece from back when I was in High school and recently watched a few Studio Ghibli movies that I highly enjoyed, if you know some series with similiar vibes or anything else that you think might fit my purpose I'd gladly get to know them (:

I want to get gamete storage so me and my bf can have a kid of our own one day



*However* - and it's another huge fuckin wreck poking its nose in - looking at [this site](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/egg-sperm-and-embryo-storage-limits/consultation-document-gamete-egg-sperm-and-embryo-storage-limits) it says that the max storage is 10 years unless you can basically prove premature infertility, at which point it can be expanded upwards to a max of 55 years



Bf and I haven't even started uni yet, and my course (being the longest) is 6 years. I haven't got a referral for storage yet, but if it did happen sort of soon then we'd basically be forced to get a kid right after we leave uni. We wouldn't have even had solid jobs for long, let alone save up enough for a decent house and somewhere good to raise a kid! Not in 4 years. We wouldn't be ready, but the 10 year limit would force our hands




Would going on T count as premature infertility? Or does that have to relate to genetics only? And if it doesn't count, what should I do guys? I really want to have a kid of my own with this guy one day, but 10 years is way too soon for us.

TW: Exclusion of trans people.

I have noticed that non straight people often make fun of straights and that's all fun and good, but, especially when talking about pop culture, I feel like sometimes people go too far with some jokes and criticisms, and I feel it's because they don't realize there are trans people (including enbies) who happen to be straight too. 

My question is, does that bother you? 

I identify as enby and asexual, so I don't really know how straight I am, but some of these jokes... don't sit well with me. And then you ask them, they tell you ""oh, I wasn't taking trans people into account when I made that joke"" and I'm like?? That's not good? 

The way that I think they see it is that being trans, in some way, reduces your straightness. Like, ""we're not talking about you because your transness makes you different from those other straight people"" and although I can see that point in some way, I think that is, overall, a mess. Because, the more I pay attention to certain situations, the more I think people just don't count trans people in general. 

But maybe other trans people don't mind? I don't know, what's your personal opinion on this?

I'm sure we all agree that trans people deserve to be at shelters they identify with ie trans men should be allowed at men's shelters, trans women should be able to be at women's shelters.

Say there was a women's shelter that served women, including trans women. A trans man gets referred by saying they're a cis woman to get in. They pass entirely as a man, though that's pretty irrelevant outside of other residents seeing this person as a man.

The person stays there a while, but then begins to get upset with other residents when they call them ""she/her"", with him saying, ""I am a man, my pronouns are he/him"". Other residents become escalated by this, because they expect it to be a women's shelter and it's very important to them that its women only, due to many having experienced sexual assault/abuse/etc by men. When talked to, this person admits they are a trans man but said they're a woman to stay there.

Doesn't this feel oppressive to the person in question? Wouldnt allowing them to stay be oppressive because a women's shelter wouldn't ever let cis men stay there? I feel like it's saying, ""you're a trans man, so like.. Less of a man than a cis man"" if they were to stay.

It\'s all really confusing.\n\nWe were supposed to see a therapist in early July. It\'s now coming up on September and we still don\'t have an appointment booked. I\'ve been pressuring them a lot recently and just do not know if I can wait any longer. I\'m wondering. Should I start estrogen now without their knowledge? I\'d have to hide it, I\'d have to somehow hide my bodily changes, and they\'d eventually find out. But I\'m so scared of my body becoming more masculine and I feel like the way it is now is perfect for transitioning... I\'m just, scared and anxious as I\'ve notice my facial hair beginning to grow more rapidly.

I'm Mikey (they/them) and I'm a PhD candidate in Anthropology at the CUNY Graduate Center doing research on transgender health, medicine, and care in the US. What follows is the research recruitment language approved by my university, so I apologize if it sounds a little robotic.

I am conducting research on the challenges that transgender children and their families may face while seeking medical care for transitioning and figuring out what good care means more generally. In particular I want to know about trans, gender non-conforming, and gender-diverse people’s experience with medical institutions, especially people of color. If you are a trans, GNC, or gender-diverse person and identify as a person of color aged 18-65 and are interested in participating in this study, then please get in touch with me.

Similarly, any other trans people aged 18-25 of any race who are interested should reach out as well. If you are under 18 and interested, then you will need parental permission.

Interested and qualified participants will have one interview of approximately 1 hour. Follow up interviews may be requested, but are not required. You will receive $25 for your time.

Interviews will be on zoom/skype/or some other equivalent in order to properly socially distance. 

Email: [melster@gradcenter.cuny.edu](mailto:melster@gradcenter.cuny.edu) for more information and to see if you qualify.

I'm happy to answer any questions you might have in the meantime. Thanks, and have a good day!",trans,Research Participation (compensation offered),1598244959.0,"{'created_utc': 1598219759, 'id': 'ifc7ua', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hi everyone,\n\nI'm Mikey (they/them) and I'm a PhD candidate in Anthropology at the CUNY Graduate Center doing research on transgender health, medicine, and care in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

I cant sleep, i cant work, i cant do schoolwork, i cant workout, all of it leading to the simple i wanna die.

Fun fact i should be working rn and i just cant concentrate

&amp;#x200B;

You can get the full story about my parents prohibiting me to be trans but the tldr is: 

i came out to my mom, she pretended she was ok, she said i gave her depression, now  according to my dad i cant be a girl in my own home ""or else"" i guess

&amp;#x200B;

Now the what happened

I moved (temporarily as far as my parents know) to a different city with a friend, now i can do anything i want and finish discovering myself. 

A week passes and i break up with my gf because of problems that have nothing to do with the rest of this, we made the agreement of still being friends cause i still like her company i just cant date her anymore. We kinda talk some times for a couple of days, now she doesnt talk to me and i dont know why, so now i feel alone and im very attention starved.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the i moved part of it, i get messages from my parents at least once a week, i dont want to ever interact with them but i gotta pretend. My mother is the one that messages me most times, she asks how im doing, tells me she misses me and that she loves me, that last thing is my no-go zone and i cant keep the facade and always reply with a ""yeah sure me too"" or something along the lines. They didn't support me a year ago when i desperately needed them and i dont think they would now so im not gonna risk my psychological well being on talking to them about this. 

Im tired of them saying they love me when they clearly dont want me to be who i am and provoked me suicidal thoughts by doing so. 

I wanted to be someone that made them proud and i wanted their love but im clearly not ""the son they wanted"" so i guess ill never have that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every night i feel alone because of what happened with my gf and i feel like i will never be who i want to (because that was my mothers first reaction to me coming out, she doubted i could be a woman). I force myself to stay up playing videogames or watching movies as long as i can because i dont wanna lie down in bed alone with my thoughts. My father actually said that i shouldnt be ""one of them queers"" because all of the ones he knows hate themselves and occupy all their free time working on anything so they are never alone with their thoughts. 

I hate my parents and i dont think i can forgive what they did to me.

&amp;#x200B;

As i said i cant sleep at night, i just dont feel safe, i feel like i need someone in bed with me to make feel like its safe to let my guard down and rest. (that last part was something me and my therapist concluded after my first appointment, more on that later) I dont sleep at night so my body gives in at  some point during the morning, i should be working via home office during the mornings, so now in order to meet the deadlines i end up pulling all nighters  just before the due date (tpday is one of those days but i just cant concentrate). Same thing goes for schoolwork, im very near getting my bachelors degree but im prolly just gonna barely make it because of whats happening. I used to workout on the mornings just before work but now im either working to meet the deadline or just sleep my body couldnt keep up all night. So lack of sleep is the one thing thats destroying my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel alone so yesterday i made a tinder (this is the third time i believe), i got 8 matches in my first day so thats an ego boost, but i dont think its healty, every time ive used it was because i needed the ego boost but doing it has alway ended up bitting my ass. I just need people to talk, my friends are not always availible and theres people here trying to talk to me so i guess i can take that out of it.

I’ve got a lot of stuff going on. I’m autistic. I’m obsessive compulsive. I’ve got BED. I have depressive disorder. I’m not always in the best shape. I tend to end up in relationships that are one sided or unfulfilling. Well, after coming out to myself and my close friends, I felt so good about myself and so confident for the first time in my life, I was able to stand up for myself and advocate for myself in my current emotional manipulative relationship, and I wasn’t overcome with fear at being alone.

I'm matthew schneeman, a radio/podcast producer. I'm working on a project called A Year from Now. We interview people who have just undergone a big event, wait a year, and do a follow up. I've interviewed someone recovering from a TBI, businesses that have closed due to the virus, a man who's getting deployed to Syria, a step moms first year entering a new family, a dude that impulsively bought a muscle car ... 

Does anyone want to share their story? Anyone recently come out? The 'big event' doesn't have to be trans related if you have another story worth sharing.

Obligatory typed from mobile warning

Over the past couple of months I've come out to my incredibly supportive girlfriend about my crossdressing fetish (or at least it started out as one) and expresses that I want to try it out in public and she was 100% supportive. After doing that for a while it became more natural and has manifested into what I now believe is me wanting to fully present as the opposite gender.

Being a female has always been a fantasy that popped into my head from time to time but never to the point that I'm considering changing who I am. I'm completely aware that it could just be a ""phase"" and plan on sitting on the thought of transitioning for a very long time before making a commitment that will have permanent effects on my body. I'm not unhappy per se being a male but the thought of what life would be like as a female sounds even better.

My biggest concern right now is that I love my parents very much and I know they feel the same. They have no idea about any of what I've shared here or my internal monologue that's a constant battle of wondering who I'm really meant to be in this world. I'm incredibly scared that they won't support what I tell them if I ever get to the point of transitioning. They're both in their 60s and very conservative. I fear that they won't support me or love me the same if I came out. My mother has only seen a very small portion of my crossdressing and I didn't get a very good reception to that at all. I don't want to lose their love.

Thank you to my super supportive girlfriend that has been there every step of the way. I honestly don't know what I would have done without her being there for me.

2020-08-26 05:11:19,igsuax,1,1,"So, I, AFAB, have been exploring my sexuality and gender for a while now. Due to being a teen in a super conservative, Christian family, I used to always believe that I was a straight girl. A little over a year ago, however, I started to realize that I was attracted to girls, but I suppressed it, and tried to focus on my then boyfriend. After that relationship ended, I admitted that I was at least bisexual. I went with that term for a while before, ultimately, realizing that I don't want to date guys, so I switched to lesbian. Now I am having another identity crisis. I've known for a while now that if I could've chosen whether to be AFAB or AMAB, I would be AMAB, but it wasn't until pretty recently that I started to consider whether I was actually a girl or not. It really started after I got a ""boy's haircut"" (mom's words, not mine). It happened when the quarantines died down in my area and we all started wearing masks. I would always wear a hoodie, jeans, sneakers, and a mask, and I would hope that someone would mistake me as a guy. I was kinda disappointed that it never happened, but it led me to begin questioning my gender. I started imagining what it would be like if I got top surgery, and just the thought made me so excited. I also asked one of my friends to start calling me my preferred name and pronouns—Alex, he/him—and that made me happier than I could even began to describe, but I'm still having doubts. I'm worried that I'm just trying to jump on the bandwagon, since a lot of my friends are trans, and I'm also worried it might be internalized homophobia, since I've heard of a few lesbians thinking they were trans, when it turns out they just thought they weren't supposed to date girls.

A world like this involves magic. In my magic system there are 2 ""Grand Fae"" (essentially gods) - and 'magic' is them granting boons. They hear the wishes / hearts of mankind, and if they're convinced, they grant it.

Fae of Creation can create - Fae of Destruction can destroy. When they work together (which they rarely do,) they can **change**

So I need to backstory the Fae, how they came to be.

And I want it tied to how they work (ie: pretty much prayer, but they actually exists and it works)

So **change** should create them.

The thought I had was a trans woman needs the change so badly, goes to the forest to cry out to the universe for it, etc, that the Fae came into being to grant it.

2020-08-26 20:27:20,ih6pus,3,1,"So, I didn't know where to post this, and I'm doing it here. If this is the wrong subreddit for this then sorry mods.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been feeling confused about my gender for a few months now, I look in the mirror everyday, see my beard, my build and I always felt...wrong. When I was an early teen I used to secretly wear my mom's dresses and go in front of the mirror and do these silly overly feminine poses. They made me feel happy. Made me feel satisfied, made me feel like who I am really am from the inside. These last few months I decided to give it some time and get my thoughts in process. So I decided to a bit more research towards this and I found out about gender dysphoria and stuff like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its just, I don't think I'm completely a trans woman. I don't hate my current body...I'm just indifferent to it. But, whenever I think if I was born as a girl it just makes me...weirdly happy and giddy for some reason. Whenever I think of others referring to me with feminine pronouns I just become...happy. Its very hard to explain but it just makes me feel satisfied about myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got the courage to finally tell this to my parents last month, and the thing is, they just keep telling me its a phase I'm going through. They told me that they wouldn't have differentiated between how I was raised if I was a boy or a girl. My Dad even told me to just ""accept the body that you are"" and my Mom described to me how lucky I am for being born as male because I won't have to suffer through periods and catcalling and the feeling of not being safe while walking alone at night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its just that, I get it that what points my Mom made are valid. I don't have a female biology(as much as I oh so wish I had) I won't be able to experience periods(but if I had the chance to, I would suffer through the pain if it made me more feminine) I never have experienced cat calling or had fear for my safety while being alone(but if it makes me more feminine, I would live with that risk)

&amp;#x200B;

Its...just that whatever are the so called negatives of being a woman that my Mom calims to be....I want to experience that! I want to feel that, it isn't a negative for me at all. Its hard to explain why but, I would gladly and lovingly accept all of that if I got the chance to just be seen as a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

I forwarded them links about gender dysphoria and videos about other trans people from my country who came out and managed to legally change their gender. I wanted them to be aware about how I was feeling wasn't just a ""phase"" that would pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, they still refuse to refer to me as their daughter because they said that for 20 years of their life they have raised me as a son and it is hard for them to suddenly change that.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted them to take me to a psychologist so that they and I can become more aware about this problem too...but they refused saying it wasn't necessary

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't done anything to look feminine. Not done hormone treatment or any of that...but after researching about it, I want to go for it. I just, don't really know if what I'm feeling right now about myself is just a phase or not. That feeling of giddy excitement I get when I secretly wear my Mom's dress and look feminine is still very strong.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that I'm from India, which is not a very accepting country when it comes to stuff like this, so it just seems like a tough road. Getting a psychologist willing to help me, people willing to support me is not as easy as it is in the West. My own friends always have had this heavily stigmatized view of trans people(especially trans women) as a whole, maybe they just meant those as a joke but, its just...sometimes I wish I could move out to another country that is more accepting and be myself there.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my Mom and Dad have told me to not reveal this to anyone else because ""what will people think of our family?"" and that really hurt because it seems like they're more concerned for what society thinks than what I think of myself. I...feel like my Dad himself did not believe me when I told him how I felt...he still refuses to take me seriously. My Mom still tells me ""I should be happy being a man, and being a woman isn't worth it, it all looks happy and marry and green from your side, but the reality is that it isn't"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I want to do...but one day...even if I don't transition medically...at least one day I want to dress up like a woman and just go out there in the open and I want people to refer to me as female. That's my one and only dream I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to vent here...my country's culture isn't very accepting and even though I don't know enough about the legality related stuff of here, but I want to see if its possible to legally change my gender. I just don't know what to feel about my body anymore. There's this grey area of confusion that I'm in, so I would love to know what people here think about what I'm going through...thank you

&amp;#x200B;

Came to terms with officially being trans about a week ago and came out to my family (I said I'm pretty sure I'm trans because I still feel somewhat uneasy). I had done some crossdressing in the past and it made my family extremely uncomfortable so I stopped, but I kept circling back to thoughts of needing to do it. After the coming out talk my sister mentioned that it was almost 4 years since I tried crossdressing so they had a lot of time to process. I just turned 25 and I'm really mad at myself because I could have been on hormones since 21. I'm not on hormones because my mom is really worried and wants me to take my time since it is a permanent medical change, but I feel like there is a ticking clock for my body. I'm already too late for bone changes (i think) and I'm way taller than I'd like.

Anyone else have the regret of not just figuring it out earlier? There were a lot of different moments that sort of add up and make sense, but I was always in denial because it was all just too scary. I just wish I was more honest with myself or had more open conversations with people. I know that I was never 100% certain because when I heard about dysphoria I was like ""I don't have that, I'm just perpetually depressed, which is totally normal and unrelated"" like, why am I so stupid.... I also want to find the logical reason for all these feelings and there just isn't any. Like, ""why should it matter if I look like a boy or girl? It's all just what society says, it's the inside that counts."" but I still really envy other women and when I crossdressed I got called miss one time and it was the best feeling ever. Idk I'm just venting my thoughts. I have a therapist, but I feel like I haven't been able to talk to anyone who has these similar feelings other than seeing these reddit posts to help me come to terms with how I'm feeling.

Sorry for rambling.

TL;DR I wish I had taken steps towards transition earlier instead of always pushing down my feelings and now it feels like I missed out because I'm 25 so I'll forever be an ugly girl with linebacker shoulders and height.

I simply cannot afford it plus her after operation medicines will surely cost a lot. It's the middle of a pandemic in our country that is why job openings come rarely. Any amount will surely help us. I'll link my paypal below and I will also attach photos of lovely Maya.

Please do not hesitate to send a message to me here on reddit for verifications. You can also email me at [rgmanalo2@up.edu.ph](mailto:rgmanalo2@up.edu.ph) for proof that this real and not a scam.

Please help us. I will regularly post updates regarding this sweet little girl. Thank you so much!!

2020-08-27 11:02:40,ihizt5,1,1,"Hello all, this might be highly conceptual and I'm posting while thinking, so pardon my TLness

I am working in a volunteer organisation and am testing my newfound knowledge in Information Architecture to try and design a database system to measure diversity amongst our members. So I started adding the regular bits: religion, sexual orientation, gender (or lack thereof), I've also considered relational orientation (for polyam and aro folks), social race (as we know race is not biological by now) and age group.

I noticed quite quickly, as you would, that none of these can help someone declare their identity as trans. So I stood wondering the surprisingly deep question (to me at least): How to measure trans diversity?

# Basics

Of course any kind of diversity database is optional for the user. Privacy or being in between changes demands that. And input should also be ""semi-open"", providing a closed range of option and an opportunity to ask the admins to include options that aren't there.

# Possible solutions

Since trans stands at an intersection of sex and gender, and a gender column is there, would it be sufficient to ask Sex assigned at birth and Gender and assume from the relation? I guess not, for the sake of detransitioners and non-medical trans (please correct me if I mistake terms).

Would instead a larger set of option for Sex cut it? Like, male, female, third sex, MTF, FTM?

Or would no amount of deep information serve the purpose and the best solution would be the simplest ""trans flag""?

As you can see, I'm trying my best but there's still a lot of confusion, so let me know your thoughts and if I need to edit anything for clarification.",trans,"I believe in the importance of gathering diversity data, how to measure trans diversity in an org?",1598551360.0,"{'created_utc': 1598526160, 'id': 'ihizt5', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello all, this might be highly conceptual and I\'m posting while thinking, so pardon my TLness\n\nI am working in a volunteer organisation and am testing my newfound knowledge in Information Architecture to try and design a database system to measure diversity amongst our members.

i thought i knew what i wanted, went to a gender clinic type deal, came out worse than i went in, 

im german and went to charité cause i didnt know the bad reputation it had in german trans spaces,

ive felt like i wasnt a girl since i was 12 or 13, and making myself look like a boy in school made me super happy, i go by he/him and my chosen name in the spaces i feel safe in and that makes me happy,

but i know how i look and how i sound and i know nobody actually sees me how i want, theyre just being respectful but they dont actually think im male, i know im not

i used to be happy interacting with trans spaces and being proud of who i am and excited to start transitioning but since i left the clinic ive been avoiding it, ignoring my body mostly, which made my dysphoria easier to deal with, to the point i now feel like im not really trans after all but i still have these feelings and now i dont know how to solve them anymore,

whenever i think about my transness or my body or how i look now and how much i look likr a girl after all i feel even worse than i used to and its scary,

i dont believe T will make me any better, ill keep this body so its a waste to try

A little about me lol:
I am a trans male and have gotten nowhere in this transition so far because idk where to turn and the pandemic.
I only rather recently realised I am truly trans. I ""played"" with the thought at age 14/15 but wasn't accepted so I dropped it, and now as adult feel I can finally be free etc.
Also had, and have, literally no friends and no one to talk to or anything, but many classmates that talked about this and stuff. I was literally not allowed in a group of friends (I was rather new at this school, but these were the newest students) because I wasn't visibly LGBTQ+ and out there because anxiety, depression and fear because of bullying since kindergarten, and this was 9th grade... aka when I was playing with the thought and everything.
I do have an old classmate from high-school that is MtF that I have grown really close to again because of all this.


Anyways. On to the point.
Since I am rather new to this in a way I'd like to watch some youtubers that are trans to help me really understand myself and feel less alone. Idk.

I know of and watch Jammidodger every single day.

Soo.. the thing is that I've been thinking about top surgery, as my chest is what makes me feel dysphoric.
Everything's good as I can get it in my country being this young, even without my parents approvement.

Now, I'm SUPER afraid of surgeries themselves and I've never got one, I've spent the last night searching for how's it supposed to go and been looking for post op results, photos and videos.

I cannot talk about this with my parents as my mother is literally forcing me to get it (she says that I'm a monstef if I don't get it, so it doesn't help me) and I barely talk to my father.

I love this community, you guys are so sweet and kind!
So I was wondering if you could... kind of help me to lose this fear, tell me about surgeries you've got maybe?? The experiences etc..

I know I'd feel free if I get it, and I'd love to spend a day in the beach with my friends without having to see them swimming and me sitting alone in the ground.

My skin is also very sensitive, and I was wondering if either method was better for sensitive skin? The only reason I don't shave everyday is because it gets inflamed if I shave it too frequently.

Ever since I came out to her, our relationship has been practically nonexistent. But recently it seemed like she was actually making the changes necessary for us to be close again, and at the end of the day I've always been a mama's boy, so I was happy about this possibility. She doesn't use my real name, instead an approved nickname that was part of my dead name, but I always loved this nickname, so that's fine. She never uses the correct pronouns, but she tries to make sure to call me a boy and has even called me her son to people in public and once corrected my dad (who is extremely transphobic) when he misgendered me. Considering how she was before, I felt these were big steps for her and that she was actually making good progress.

But today she asked me when I started to realize I was trans. I was actually really happy about this because she complains to my sister all the time that she just doesn't understand but she want to make an effort. (But she has never actually asked me genuine questions before now so I don't know how she expected to learn.) So I was glad to share parts of my journey with her finally.

I told her how I really started noticing and questioning when puberty hit, and other parts of my journey, but while I was talking she made a face like she just put everything together. And it wasn't in a good way. After I finished talking, she said, ""Well it makes total sense that it was at that time.

Because I always thought it was weird that all of a sudden everybody is trans now. It's because of that vaccine. My friend at work has a child the same age as you who also got the vaccine and they're trans too.""

And I just... I can't even with this woman. This isn't even her most outrageous conspiracy theory about vaccines!

When you were 13 your doctor convinced me to give you the hpv vaccine even though I didn\'t want to. And I found out that they actually put gender bender chemicals in that vaccine. Because I always thought it was weird that all of a sudden everybody is trans now. It\'s because of that vaccine. My friend at work has a child the same age as you who also got the vaccine and they\'re trans too.""\n\nAnd I just... I can\'t even with this woman. This isn\'t even her most outrageous conspiracy theory about vaccines! I told her I\'m definitely still trans and this doesn\'t change anything, and she seemed very fine and accepting of that, but jesus man. I called my sister to tell her what happened and apparently my mom has already been telling everyone I\'m trans because of the hpv vaccine.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""My mom thinks I'm trans because of vaccines??"", 'created': 1598683465.0}"

Even though it's still very early on (3 months HRT), and I know I have more battles down the road, I was so so terrified to tell them. I wanted to share this story in case anyone else here is worried about coming out to their kids.

For reference, I have two boys, 10 and 16. My youngest lives with my wife and I full time, and my oldest is split 50/50 with his mom. Honestly, I couldn't be more proud of the way they handled the news. We told them separately, because of the gap in maturity in understanding.

16 year old went first, and we started by explaining that this wasn't bad news necessarily, but his mom and step dad were available to come get him if he was upset and wanted to leave for any reason. We wanted to make sure he had an emotional escape if he needed it. After than, we asked him if he knew what gender dysphoria was. He didn't, so we explained what it meant, and that I have been suffering from it since I was a teenager. We explained the steps that I've taken so far, and what the future would look like - new name, pronouns, social presentation, etc., coming and what the timeline for those things might look like. When we asked how he felt about those things, his response was ""you really thought I'd be upset about that? You need to take care of yourself too, ya know."" And gave me the biggest hug I'd gotten from him since he was a snuggly toddler.

This was so incredibly relieving, and I was so happy I cried. I wasn't the most emotional person pre-estrogen, so this was definitely new for me.

The 10 year old was next. We explained that sometimes, people are born with girl bodies, but boy hearts, and boy brains. That sometimes they're born with boy bodies, but with girl hearts and girl brains. He already knew this based on prior conversations. When we told him that daddy was born with a boy body, but a girl heart and girl brain, he seemed a little confused at first. So we elaborated on what was going to happen as time went on, and asked how he felt. His response was simple and amazing: ""I will always love you no matter what!""

Again, as earlier, I couldn't help the tears. These kids never cease to amaze me and I'm so proud of how good of people they are. I guess it shows that we've done something right in making and raising these little humans. But more than that, it shows that kids are resilient and can adapt to/accept change even when it's something so huge like this.

I (23cisF) and my boyfriend (20FTM) of almost one year had sex. No prosthetic, not quite insertion - just genitals to genitals and he was even able to finish ! I haven’t been able to stop smiling since !! I felt so close to him and it was all so normal ! 

My main mission of this relationship is to make him feel as close as he can to a cis male. This is my first relationship with a trans man (I have only been with cis men) so there’s been a HUGE learning curve. 

Before he had his top surgery I took him to a secluded river for kayaking so he could take his shirt off and let the sun hit his chest. 
I comment on how his hands are so much bigger than mine. 
I try to make him feel comfortable in his shoe size by putting his shoes on and saying they’re huge. 
I push male roles onto him (before you think I’m toxic - it’ll be small things like “well you’re the boyfriend, you have to go see what that scary noise downstairs was!” ).


Sex was the one place I was having difficulty making him feel 100% male AND IT FINALLY HAPPENED ! I could seriously cry. 

Do any of you have any other tips for how I can make him feel *more* cis ?

2020-08-29 14:45:37,iitjve,22,1,"Opinion: Transgender men and women should inform a person of their trans status before even basic physical intimacy (e.g. kissing) occurs, as a matter of consent.

Having read a post in another sub talking about someone discovering their partner was trans, I feel like my opinion is pretty damn unpopular. Clearly many people feel that trans people need only tell someone of their trans status before taking their interaction to an explicitly sexual level.

I cannot for the life of me understand how this issue transcends the boundaries of consent. There are a number of reasons why telling someone before ANY intimacy occurs should absolutely be the case, and I’ll start with the issue of safeguarding trans people.

As many trans people expressed in the other post, they didn’t want to immediately disclose this information to someone they might kiss or date for their own safety. The rationale was that they might put themselves in danger by telling a potential violent transphobe (a very real issue unfortunately). However, for this very reason, if you’re trans, you should absolutely NOT wait till AFTER you’ve gotten emotionally or physically intimate with someone who very well could be violently transphobic, to tell them. This puts you in a situation where instead of facing rejection, you could experience serious harm.

This is not to say you should disclose this information to anyone, everyone has a basic right to privacy, however if you know that the interaction is moving towards intimacy, you should absolutely inform the other person.

My second reason is that of consent. Having a personal preference about who you are intimate with (even when kissing) is completely fair. More than that, people have a basic human right to their personal preference. Therefore, not wanting to be intimate with someone who is trans does not make you a transphobe or a bigot. Being transphobic or bigoted is actively discriminating against trans people in the decisions and interactions you make on a day to day basis. However when someone’s body is involved, it cannot be labelled issue of discrimination. It is an issue of consent. When you surpass the boundary of physical intimacy (when kissing), and do not inform someone of your trans status beforehand, you are violating their right to knowing consent, and you are deceiving them.

This consent is not just about personal preference, but also circumstance. Someone may very well have an extremely conservative/religious family (even if they themselves are completely accepting) and becoming even basically intimate with a trans person (even unknowingly) can cause that person to be ostracised by their family or religious community if discovered. Therefore taking just 5 seconds to tell someone you are about to kiss or get touchy feely with about your trans status can save that person a world of trouble. If they are completely fine with it, then they are fine with it. If they aren’t, both parties can walk away with no harm done.",trans,"Really want to get a trans persons opinion of my opinion.

2020-08-29 17:15:54,iiw6mg,0,1,"A bit of an education for others..

The term transgender is an umbrella term that represents many types of trans people that do not identity partially or wholy with the gender they were assigned at birth. There are binary and non-binary because gender exists as a spectrum and it is not binary. The feelings and experiences of trans people are often very similar also vary from one side of that spectrum to the other. Including the experience of euphoria, dysphoria, trans-femme, trans-masculine, gender fluid, non-binary, agender, and many more.

The trans journey is about finding and accepting your true self. Not blending in as before based on the expectations of others.

Gatekeepers (whether trans ir not) attempt to define who can be included in the trans umbrella and who can't using various non-inclusive criteria. It is damaging and dangerous to trans people who are trying to find themselves and be who they are.  

Invalidating the identity of other trans people is not only quite uncool it is dangerous to trans people. When someone tells you that they're trans the correct response is to accept them at their word because they need your empathy and support..

The feelings and experiences of trans people are often very similar also vary from one side of that spectrum to the other.

2020-08-30 05:55:46,ij7ulf,2,1,"Hey all. I've been working to combat my dysphoria for about 7 years now and have IDed as non-binary (based on my dysphoria I've considered myself probably bigender or genderfluid, but liked the umbrella term non-binary for convenience's sake).

For a long time I never had an ideal ""transition goal"". I'm AFAB with a history of various endocrinology / reproductive issues on my mother's side of the family for pretty much every AFAB member on that side, so I always thought I wouldn't get to be on T. (I've been too afraid of going in and getting a definite 'no' if I'm being honest.) I kind of envisioned a happy, out as trans me as someone who didn't really think about their own physical form. I dissociate a lot due to mental health and figured that was par for the course.

But very recently a trend started emerging for men's aesthetic where I am where chubby, but muscular dudes with stubble, long hair and glasses are suddenly cool, and are definitely still read as dudes socially. That's been on my mind almost nonstop. Not to mention recently my quarantine workouts have begun to pay off - a chubby dork like me can get buff? And I've been getting hit by gigantic, sometimes literally dizzying amounts of dysphoria.

I also found out about how some preT dudes see results from minoxidil, and I realized - I could get that aesthetic. And suddenly the question of, ""wait, do I actually want to be a dude? Am I gonna be a dude For Real??"" Won't leave my head. I've never been so dysphoric in my life. Voice training, workouts, a bit of a haircut, and minoxidil ... I could get all the things I wanted from T. It's the most connected to my body I've ever felt, too. It's completely alien. I've gone from looking in the mirror and seeing nobody to seeing myself, a work in progress. It's so jarring and uncomfortable. 

But I feel like a traitor if I change my ID now. I've been out in varying levels of non-binary for years. New name, pronouns when able to, and I had to be the one to give a lot of trans education to friends since there's not a lot of open trans people in some of my social circles. I'm terrified of confirming some of the horrible stereotypes of nb people I've heard. It's making it hard for me to consider if I'm actually a trans guy who thought he was non-binary, or if I'm non-binary and this is just a swing of dysphoria that'll level back out.

I get hair coverage pretty much everywhere if I don't shave, I've been shaving for months but it takes literally an hour in the shower and although I can get a good close shave it still leaves follicles somewhat visible under the skin so not the best solution.

I've tried using wax strips and they're almost completely ineffective, they leave my skin sticky and irritated and they grab very little hair. I've also tried using Veet Men's hair removal cream but this also is only barely effective even if I leave it on longer than the maximum recommended time. I've heard women's hair removal cream i.e. Nair might be better but I have no idea and I don't see why it would be better on a male body than specific men's hair remover?

I have an epilator which works and I try to use but it is incredibly slow and painful and I can't really bring myself to use it even though it has the best results out of anything I've tried so far. Obviously ideally I would just go and get electrolysis or lasered but I don't have 4 grand kicking about the house to blow on hair removal. I'm a student I got a tight budget.

So apparently this is a new term of some sort. It’s not entirely clear exactly who it’s meant to be referring to though.

I first heard about this from the J. K. Rowling controversy, apparently she had a problem with it, but the wording of the page I was reading this from didn’t make any sense. 

It said that this term refers to transgender women, but then I thought about it and realised that made no sense, since transplants of the entire female reproductive system aren’t currently possible with today’s science.

Then I looked it up, and it said it referred to transgender men, which makes more sense, but now I’m more confused because I don’t quite understand the point of the term.

Every gender has the opportunity to menstrate, so why would this term be used exclusively for transgender males? If the term was “men who menstrate” that would make perfect sense, but it’s the other one instead.

I’m more just asking out of curiosity rather than any major need to know, mainly cos when I search “people who menstrate” on the transgender subreddits/ r/lgbt, there’s no results, so presumably it doesn’t get talked about a lot.

 Just wanted to see if anyone has any idea why the massive price change for laser hair removal around the world differs so drastically?

I currently pay $30 AUD (currently half price, normally $60) and I’m soon relocating back to the U.K. and as I’m around half way through my treatments I thought I would do some research to find that the price for 1 session in the U.K. is £255! ($460)

If there is not a valid reason for this gross pricing surely there is something protecting this outrageous overpricing tactic?

I haven’t researched any other locations but I presume it fluctuates a lot world wide.

However, in my band class, which I was SUPER excited for because the band director/constructor is do amazing, it all went down hill.
