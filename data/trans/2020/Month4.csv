HRT is going well I think, my skin is softer, my face is starting to look softer too, my chest is growing more, and I've been super emotional. I was hoping to get my dose upped but because of the coronavirus I can't do blood work so I'm just extending my prescription. Picked that up today which is cool.

I'm not out at work, but this last week I've been wearing eyeliner to work and people aren't being too weird about it. Baby stepping it is helping me a bit.

I am starting the ball rolling to get my name changed and waiting for my doctor to get back to me about it. I want to do that as I'm coming out so I can purge my deadname from the systems lol

On Wednesday last week I walked for 4 hours through town for the first time in full girl mode alone. Sadly my mood was ruined cause my HRT appointment was cancelled without me knowing (they tried to call but couldn't reach me for some reason) so I had to walk back with super sore feet. But I think I looked cute and even had lady yell from across the street that my outfit was perfect. So it wasn't bad.

Aaaand that is about all I wanted to say. Just felt like I wanted to throw something out there. I'm gonna try to take selfies tomorrow with my high quality camera to see how they turn out.

2020-04-01 08:05:22,fsvhox,3,1,"So, I am not sure if I am trans, but I haven't felt like a girl for my entire life. If anything, I am quite sure that I fall at least somewhere on the nonbinary spectrum, but there have also consistently been moments in which I look into the mirror and see a guy, and just feel this need for myself to actually reflect it because it is what I have often felt for as long as I can remember. However, there's one force that makes me question everything that I feel and maybe even cause some internally directed transphobia?

My mother has been openly, flat out trying to convince me that I am trans and that she has ""always known"" for years now, and it makes me feel extraordinarily uncomfortable when she does this which leads to me denying any inkling that I might be trans. Now, in different contexts I can see how this is favorable to more conservative parents, but the way she goes about it is just strange. She seems to have an extremely binary idea of gender, saying that ""if I'm not trans, then I should be more feminine"" and things like that. It feels like she wishes that I could be as LGBT as possible so I can be some sort of accessory to talk about to her friends so she can show off how current she is or some bullshit. 

Conversation with her is pretty much out of the question, as she is very childish and quick to throw a fit and shut down, so I don't think I can go about changing her opinions on the matter. I guess my question to you folks is, how can I feel comfortable about truly figuring out and accepting what my gender identity is when I feel like leaving behind the label of cisgender would make me into some exotic talking point in the eyes of such an involved figure in my life?

She is a sub and she loves being a sub, so she expressed a conflict of interest with that, too. She showed me 3 bracelets of hers that say ‚Äúbabydoll‚Äù, ‚Äúbunny‚Äù, and ‚Äúkitten‚Äù. She pointed out that we both can‚Äôt be ‚Äúbabydoll‚Äù, ‚Äúkitten‚Äù, etc.  She said me being what I currently am makes those possible for her, makes her feel safe, and she would lose that.

Ultimately, she was scared for herself. She didn‚Äôt tell me once that it was okay to feel what I feel. She very much focused on why it wouldn‚Äôt work for her, and she closed the conversation by casting guilt onto me with things like ‚ÄúI guess I don‚Äôt need to feel small/safe/etc. I can just put all of that away.‚Äù

She loves the attention and freedom of being an attractive female. I have lived vicariously through her.

For background, I am suffering from gender dysphoria. This, above all, is what drove me to my attempt.

 

I tried to commit suicide in January. My parents know, and my doctors know, but otherwise nobody knows. I had called the suicide hotline after an attempt at hanging myself, I gave my preferred name and what state I lived in, but otherwise I gave no super personal information. It took about a week to track my location, and when the counselor finally took me out of class for a talk, my parents were in Vegas for a week on vacation with their friends. The School counselor was pretty nice and didn't mention that she had known everything about the call (The school resource officer had been told by the suicide hotline what I had said and done, who in turn told the counselor) and I was under the belief that she didn't know about my attempt. An awkward talk (where I denied trying to commit suicide) and a call to my mom later, I was back in class and under the impression that that was all that was going to happen. Boy was I wrong.

A few days after my parents came back they took me out of sixth period and took me into the car. I knew something was going to happen as soon as I was told that I was going to leave, and I had a vague idea of what was going to happen. My parents explained that I was going to get help and that we were going to the hospital. I didn't get to tell my best friend that I was leaving or for how long (although I didn't know how long I would be gone, either). Got to the hospital, lots and lots of questions. When I'm finally free me and my mom watch movies on the little TV that was in the room. My mom had to hold the remote and they took it away when we were done with it because it had a wire.

Next day I had to take a shower. I cried for many reasons that time because, number one and the worst, was that I had to look at my body, and gender dysphoria was really awful when I had to look at myself. Second, because I couldn't be alone in the room. My mom was in there with me the whole time, and I cried the entire time. Then we were moved to the safety room, which was grey wall and basically nothing but a bed and small TV in a glass frame.

Finally after three days of waiting, We were told that that night we were being moved to a different hospital and was being enrolled in an in-patient program where I'd be stuck in for a week, at the least. We (my mom and I) were moved by ambulance. It was a crazy ride, but I made conversation with the helper dude in the back with my mom and I, cracked a few jokes, tried to reassure my mom that this was all fine, and that this would be the last time she'd have to see me in a stretcher (which probably won't turn out to be true, but still.) She told me that she loved me a lot during that hour in the ambulance.

We made it to the hospital and to the kids psych unit, where I am greeted with unfriendly, sad faces of other kids. On my overall stay, the youngest was twelve, the oldest was seventeen. More questions, filling out of paperwork, and then I was off to bed. I had a window in my otherwise barren room so that was cool :) Every morning I'd look out there at the sun, I enjoyed that.

I was very awkward the first two or three days. The other kids were pretty quiet, especially in the morning. There was this one girl, we'll call her Sarah, who talked with me a lot (she was the twelve year old), because we were at the same hospital before we got to this children's unit. We played Uno a lot.

Eventually I made friends with the LGBT kids in the unit (which about half of them were), and we did a fun activity where we made our own island. We called it ROYGBIV (Roy-jee-biv) and its national bird was something rainbow, I can't remember, it's national flower was a rainbow hibiscus, it was shaped like Lisa Simpsons head, and we had a lot of fun making it. That was the fondest memory I have of that place.

After a week (exactly seven days) I finally got out and my parents took me home. They told my older brother that I was home, but my twin didn't know. It was funny because when he got home from a basketball game he came through the front door and I was seated at the kitchen and he didn't notice me for like ten minutes. When he saw me his eyes widened and he said ""Whoa"" pretty load and asked if he could hug me, that was pretty sweet, even though I don't really like hugs.

Its been almost two months (?) I think, and I'd like to say that I am doing a lot better now, but my issues haven't really changed. I feel sad a lot, but I haven't had any suicidal thoughts since that night on January sixth. I've changed therapists and medicines, so I suppose that is good. I'm hoping that I'll get better with time and therapy. Let's hope.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. Just wanted to get this off my chest. I feel a little better now that I've said something to someone, or just writing it down. Hope y'all have amazing days, I really really want you to not end up like I did. But if you're feeling bad, Please please please talk to someone. It is not always gonna be this way. And if I can get through this shit and go to school the day after I got released, you can get better. I promise you, I **promise**. And if there is any way I can help you, or anyone else, then I will do it gladly.

The thing about going to hell is that you need to have understood happiness to feel that way. Don't assume you can't feel happy again.

2020-04-02 14:10:37,ftmzq5,0,1,"Yeah things arent going well here. Made the stupid fucking decision to tell me wife I think I'm trans while on a camping trip a few weeks ago. She had just been told all her business travel was canceled for the foreseeable future due to Covid and shes legitimately afraid. Then I go and drop the trans bomb on her. Now shes afraid for the future of her career and her marraige.

I thought things were getting better in the weeks that followed. We had a couple breakdowns where she hid in our room and cried in bed. We talked and shared and she told me not to walk on eggshells around her or make it a big deal. She even offered to go through her makeup and see what I can experiment with.

I had a vierual session with my counselor and asked my wife to Join me so she could talk and show her she isnt alone, that there are resources for spouses of trans people.

One of her biggest complaints is that she doesnt understand why I'm chasing a label. She says that I've always been chasing a label of some kind. I'm not entirely sure I agree with that and if I'm chasing any label now, it's that I want to live as the woman i feel i am; however, just in case I'm not actually trans, I want to take things slow and try dressing as a woman and wearing makeup. I dont believe a woman HAS to wear makeup or dress in dresses. Hell my aesthetic is more tomboy but I do enjoy the idea of dresses and skirts and flowy things even if my 6'2"" stout frame would make me look like a linebacker in a dress. 

Last night I asked her to go through her makeup finally and she said OK but then after like an hour or so she started to get distant and I could tell she was hurting. We finished dinner and instead of going back to look through the makeup stuff, I put on an episode of a tv show because I didnt want to rush her or push her. Which she likely took as walking on eggshells again around her so she went back to our guest room and locked her self in and wouldn't open the door or talk to me though she responded to a few texts. I finally went to bed and texted her to come sleep in her own bed, she didnt have to talk to me. 

She did finally come to bed and she put on an undershirt which she has only ever done one other time in our 10 years of marraige. I had to take 2 sleeping pills which I normally only take a half of one in order to sleep and I still was awake and stressing all night. 

I knew this wasnt going to be easy but I wasnt prepared for just how hard it would be. I've had to stop myself twice from looking for apartments in fear of an inevitable divorce and her kicking me out of the house. She told me in our shared session that I didnt give her enough credit, which tells me shes stronger and more understanding than i think she is, this will just take time and will be hard on her. I dont want to give up on us and the life weve built. 

I love her and i hope she still loves me. 

More and more for every moment I feel like giving up and that nothingness feeling of hopelessness and void of any emotion( imagine riley from Inside out when shes on the greyhound bus and her console goes gray) I get these surges of anger like NO you wont give up, you wont just fade away. You will fight for HER... both of them. Your wife and yourself.

I swear my mind works like a video and sound byte reel... a scene from The Abyss comes to my mind where Ed Harris' character ""Bud"" is trying to revive Mary Mastrantonio(his wife in the movie, though they are separated) and hes screaming at her with all his being for to fight and not back down.

2020-04-02 16:05:21,ftoynh,1,1,"Hi!

I'm 21 and I'm really confused about my gender. I was born female and I identify as a lesbian.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always known I liked girls: it all started when I was 6, playing in Habbo as a boy.

*My sister made it not to let people know anything about me*. 

And I dated girls in there, I was a boy and they were girls, it ""was ok"" in all ways.

&amp;#x200B;

With 10yo, a new girl and his brother came into my primary school. Her brother joined the football team and I was the only girl in there, so, she asked me if I was a boy and I said no but I've been lowkey questioning it since then... I know it's a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

With 12yo I came out as a lesbian thanks to an online girlfriend I had and people tought I dressed up more like a man because of that.

I hated my boobs (they're really big it's annoying) and I started to put bandanas to press them so my mom asked me if I wanted to be a boy several times (she's really open), I always said no because I felt really intimidated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to that intimidation, I wore my long hair, I've become more femenine and I centered my ""orientation"" on being a lipstick lesbian but...

Last year I started following transgender YouTubers, Instagramers, tv-shows.. and hearing their stories, all those doubts came back into my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I got a breakdown and I cut my hair really short, almost shaven and everybody likes it, I do it too but I can't stop thinking I would look awesome as a boy, I dressed up with my dad's clothes and made a Tinder account saying I'm a male (I deleted because I got scared if anyone in my uni recognizes me). I'm always changing my face in FaceApp (putting Male HD) and I'm playing videogames with a male account again.

&amp;#x200B;

About my genitals... I don't hate them but I don't like to get penetrated.

A girl tried it with toys but I didn't like it.

Last year, I tried to have sex with a boy  (even tho I really know I'm only into girls) and I hated it, really, I've even talked about it with anyone but... the only think I liked... was jerking him off, he even laughed and said I looked really amused and it wasn't because of him, it was because of how it felt to touch it.

&amp;#x200B;

So... I know I would prefer to have a ""d"" but my cis-female friends feel the same so I don't know if I really want to be a man or if I'm just... I don't know, envying it?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really confused. Did you feel the same? Is it only a phase or is it really the moment to make a step? How did you finally now?

2020-04-02 19:59:11,fttbex,1,1,"Recently because off the quarantine I have had time to think. I was assigned male at birth but for the past couple of months I have been experimenting with both makeup and feminine/unisex clothes I like makeup, especially lipstick because it makes me appear more feminine. Female underwear and clothes are also just hella comfy they just feel‚Ä¶right, no real other way to describe it.

I told my parents about a month ago that I wish to have a wardrobe change and present more femm, while they both support me, due to my very bigoted country they tell me to play it safe and don‚Äôt allow me to go outside in makeup and said nails are off the table for now snice I just switched classes and they want me to appear ‚Äúnormal for at least a week‚Äù.

I had time to reflect on myself and a lot off suppressed memories started coming back. I remember when I was a kid like 10/11 (so puberty probably had nothing to do with it) I used to wear an oversized T-shirt and stuff clothes and pillows under it to simulate having breasts and that‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôd be able to sleep at night. In every single game of pretend and most of my dreams I was always some kind of shapeshifter and I loved the idea of becoming a different person at the snap of my fingers. Around that time I have a distinct memory of seeing a trans couple on the news and unreasonably envying them. Around the age of 14 when puberty hit me I remember being very insecure about my body hair(people literally laugh at me that I am a god dammed dear) and about my fat distribution, While because of my slight lordosis I was always bottom heavy and my chest is quite large my abdomen isn‚Äôt getting ‚Äúfuller‚Äù the tissue just hangs off like a half deflated beach ball so that you can still make out my ribs while I‚Äôm fat (64kg 1,7M for anyone who‚Äôs asking),  I also remember that is when I had my phase when I made all my male avatars in games appear as feminine as possible and had a passing interest in drag to the point I watched tutorials and was checking prices for breast moulds and such . 

I already knew I was bisexual with a preference toward feminine people for a while I have only recently started questioning my gender, those suppressed memories from childhood and early teens as well as the fact that as a joke people started referring to me as ‚ÄúJessie‚Äù and using she/her pronouns and I like it, makes me believe I might actually be trans or at least fall somewhere on the NB spectrum. So far I would describe myself as a ‚Äúfemm male‚Äù a guy but presents as heavily female with the goal of passing off as one. To be honest I have no idea what I am or where to go, this post is half venting, half a cry for help.

I'm a ""writer"" (mediocre one at best, but hey, we all start mediocre) and one of my characters is trans. It's the first time I've written it like this, because I never really perceived him as being trans until someone kinda poked me on the shoulder and made me realize it. (I promise this has a point)

The character doesn't see himself as a ""gender"" in general. In his society, being a man is just about the only way to be successful, but it never really stopped him when he was a woman. When we see him as a woman near the beginning, we can see that he tends to see himself taking manly ""roles"" in his society, he imagines himself as the dominant partner, he see himself as the heir to a merchant's guild instead of his siblings, lots of stuff like that which are considered male traits in his world. 

The reason I write this is because I've hit on a nail that I feel I'd like to have more information on. After getting pretty much everything he's ever wanted through a curse (someone called it retroactive dysphoria, but IDK enough about that to really take a stand), he starts to see himself more as an actor playing a role than a real person. 

Instead of feeling like himself, he wonders ""how would X do this?"" about himself and not ""How should I do this?"" 

The character's gender identity is not really important for 99% of the story, but I'm trying to write that 1% with as much realism as possible. 

So I guess I'll narrow it down: Have you dealt with imposter syndrome? How did you react? What should I know about this type of reality?

FYI: this is going to be long. I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what community was appropriate for me to post this in but I figured y‚Äôall were one of my best bets. WARNING: this will likely get pretty nsfw in some parts.


I am a bisexual, cis girl. I have no apparent dysmorphia. I present very femininely- makeup, long ish hair, about 50/50 mens and women‚Äôs clothes. I also am definitely built like a woman. There is no denying that I am afab due to my chest and hips and general face/body shape. I have no issue being called she, her, miss, ma‚Äôam, mom, etc. 

However- 

I just wish I could be a boy sometimes. A lot of the time in fact. Ever since I was young. 

I can remember this from as early as five. I wouldn‚Äôt say necessarily then I wanted to be a boy but I did want to do boy things. Not in the sense of ‚Äòoh i played with fire trucks not barbies‚Äô.  Rather in the sense of I was mildly aware of the physical differences between afab and amab people. As a little girl I would try to pee standing up, put socks in my pants to give me a bludge, etc. 

Apart from a little while where I went by a slightly less feminine nickname, I have always been a relatively feminine girl. 

Around sophmore year and especially junior year (now) is when this desire to be a boy has really aggressively come to the surface. 

This is where this is gonna get really nsfw: 

Early sophmore year I started exploring my dominate side through porn and such. I discovered pegging. This REALLY re-sparked the whole /I need male anatomy/ thing. Which led to a chain of events: 

1. I started buying boxers. I couldn‚Äôt exactly explain why I started. But I just sort of felt like I would like them better. And I do. 

2. Usually once a day atleast I will see a man and think ‚ÄòI wish I looked like him‚Äô. Or sometimes it will just pop into my head. But I also know what me, looking the way I do now, going on T wouldn‚Äôt satisfy me. It‚Äôs almost like it has to be a very specific kid of guy I‚Äôd have to be to be happy. I‚Äôd have to go through the 10 years of rebuilding confidence otherwise. 

3. Throw back to middle school real quick. Just discovered smut. Soon to discover porn. Always had an affinity for mlm porn. Particularly imagining myself as a guy receiving head. Fast forward to late teens me: started doing that again. And generally just me as a male top. And a strap is simply not the same. 

4. Those boxer briefs I mentioned earlier? Well apart from a preference for them on a daily basis they also serve another purpose. I will spare the detail of how this works but, I use the fly in them to essentially hold down a toy that I can jack off. Absolutely 0 effect on physical sensation but it somehow just feels more right. 

End severely NSFW section. 

Conclusion:  

I think I am cis because I experience no social dysphoria that I can identify. Regardless of that I wish I could write all of this off as some sort of kink but I don‚Äôt know if I really can. Especially since it is something I think about in a completely SFW context. I really only included the NSFW information because it is where I manifest the most expression of the desire to be male. 

Even if I were trans, I couldn‚Äôt come out. I can‚Äôt even come out as Bi. I have pretty much settled that, unless I meet a girl who is worth potentially fucking with family relations, that I will strictly date men. I rarely approach women because I don‚Äôt want to find a girl who is worth it. I fear the fallout of me entering a long term wlw relationship. So even if I was trans I certainly couldn‚Äôt come out. 

And let‚Äôs say I was trans and I did come out. I think it would make things worse. I can already recognise that there is a specific type of man I want to be. And it‚Äôs one that if I went on T, I still wouldn‚Äôt be. It is the masculine, muscular, not at all androgynous, sport type. This is the opposite of the type of person I am now and is also the opposite of the type of men I am attracted to. I don‚Äôt know why that is who I want to be but it just is. And if I were to transition I almost feel that it would put me in a worse spot mentally than I am now. Because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be who I wanted. It‚Äôs practically too late. And my built in genetics will never adjust.

The thing is I feel I am still part my male gender. I would like to look more feminine and yet retain that I am I guess male physically. \n\nMaybe the word for me would be a Femdad. I look at myself and I don't like the masculine facial feature I have. I'm working on makeup, good diet and exercise. My question is about HRT. Have others taken HRT to increase feminine appearance but not transition to living as a cis trans woman?\n\nI feel my gender is both at the same time, I'm enby.

I am called  sailor, I'm 31 and I am stuck inside in self isolation, I live in Sweden and I am from the UK. There's a background and a sewing related request.

I need surgery to rectify some complications after my gender reassignment surgery and can't have it as a direct result of the pandemic. 
Im feeling really low and isolated as I don't have family or many friends since I am from the UK and not from Sweden. 
My UK family rejected me and for many years it's been a rocky relationship with extensive periods of not being able to communicate - because I am trans. 
My grandma is 93 and I will loose her in this pandemic; she never knew I even existed as me, my mum has forbidden me from ever contacting her even when she was healthy in her late 80s. The one thing that I regret is that I never kept the quilt she made for me as a child it was beautiful. Hand stitched. I really regret that but when I came out I was homeless and on the streets. 
I moved her to escape the UK and all the drawbacks it has. I don't drink and never did drugs and the culture here is much less pub focused which I like. 

The pandemic is making me very anxious to go out and look for work which I must do. I already had anxiousness as an issue.  I sometimes threw up I'm that anxious. It's partly due to the trauma of having lived on the streets and partly knowing I will never see my grandma again or attend her funeral. 

I just lost my job where I worked as a quality process engineer in the bioprinting sector. 
There's days where I just wake up and cry. I want to go back to bed but I can't because it hurts due to the surgery complications. There's times where I can't sleep at all. Or sleep 4 hours. 
I need hormone replacement therapy and can't access it for a number of reasons. 

Basically I was wondering; is there anyone here who would be open to helping me feel a lot safer and some compassion.
 perhaps a little less anxious; I'd really appreciate a quilted rainbow or non-binary flag mask ; I looked to buy one but I simply can't afford it...  And also they don't exist.

My name is Sam, I'm a 31-year-old Marine veteran, I've always been bisexual, and for a really long time I've always been uncomfortable looking at my body. Generally being aware of my body in fact... I don't like thinking about it, and that doesn't sound acceptable.

So, I'm not really questioning **if** I am trans, I'm more concerned with what path I should take. I am mtf, for clarity sake.

1: Mtf folks, how would I go about starting hrt, and what does it generally cost?
1a: Are there any psychological prerequisites, like do I need a referral or can I just find a specialist and go directly to them?

2: Mtf, and sorry if this is one of those things you don't ask, but... How do erections factor in for your social life when passing as a woman, or even trying to? I'm in my 30s so it isn't like I'm boner city any more, but I don't know how I could even possibly explain that to anyone I know. Even if they supported me as a trans person.

3: I am married, and I've discussed my desire to both physically be a woman and be treated as such, and while she seems receptive to my feelings, I'm not convinced she would actually be open to the possibility... I love her, and I know that it is OUR relationship, and communication is key. But how do I choose between my soulmate and the empty ache in myself, if it comes to that?

4: Since I am in my 30s, is transitioning/hrt even worth starting?

2020-04-06 16:41:27,fw21fc,4,1,"Hi. May I post this here as a genderfluid? I haven't seen any fluid post or much without a pic here. Please excuse my long ass post..

I'm thinking of changing my real name to a less feminine one. The problem is that when I imagine anyone calling me with the new name, I don't feel like being called, even tho I like it and have always been using it everywhere on the internet for some years. Do you think perhaps that's just because *no one* has ever call me that in real life? Maybe I'm just not used to it?

""Oktovria"" isn't my real name; ""Ve"" is. It's the first two letters of my real name, but even that, I still don't *genuinely* feel like that's me since only one friend actually call me that way. The others always call me my full first name (which I don't want to expose, not that I hate it, just privacy thing) and that's the only way I genuinely feel like being called.

I also think people wouldn't like ""Oktovria"" as it sounds weird, I mean I know it is. I hope you won't hate me for being so fussy but, I didn't even choose it because I really really like it, it was because I'm always scared to commit and thought if I pick a name I truly like there's big possibility that I'll not like it at some point in the future and want to change it again, I chose it because my birthday is in October. See, I've thought of ""Autumn"", ""Oktober"" (october in my mother language), ""Okta"" (a, at least, normal name here), anything that ""won't change"", I even tried to make a name from my birth date in many languages. I consider Oktovria is the safest because I think it's best to use the greek or ""the first version of any words"".

I'm really scared of committing to a new name. I'll tell you the ones I really like how they sound but eliminated: Edgar, Adrian, Bagaskara (might sound weird to you but it's a ""normal"" name here and damn I like it very much), Chandra (a unisex name here, me and my girlfriend like it), and many more.

Do you guys feel the same way? If any of you guys do, what's your solution to that? Will I ever get used to ""Oktovria""? Do you guys think ""I try too much to sounds cool"" or think it's weird? Should I even change my name or stay with my real name because making people call me ""Ve"" is easy and it actually doesn't sound that feminine without the rest of my real name?

I'm really bad at explaining since English isn't my first language I hope you understand what I mean..

2020-04-06 18:17:10,fw3v7w,3,1,"It's hard not to be able to transition right away, but if you can't medically transition, it's so much worse.

Let me explain.

I have a heart condition called hypoplastic left heart. This means the left side of my heart didn't grow in the womb. I was born genetically female but, at the age of 14, found out I wasn't female but instead male. I became so excited when I found out trans males exist and I could be a man but then I did a bit of research and my whole world came collapsing in on me.

Due to my heart condition, I can't take hormones because, if I do, I have an increased chance of having a heart attack and dying (14% to be exact). This means my body will forever be physically female. I can dress like a man, talk like a man, act like a man... but I can't transition to look like a man. This goes for top surgery, too. I have a complex system that helps my heart run deep inside my body and, without my doctor's permission, I can't get top surgery either. This means I will always have to bind if she doesn't approve the top surgery. I will be talking to her later about this issue but for now, the answer stands at ""no top surgery"".

And you know how difficult this all is? So difficult that I have to deal with dysphoria on a daily basis, and probably will for the rest of my life.

Those of you who can transition are very lucky because you get a chance to be yourselves 100% of the way. Those of you who can take hormones, get top surgery, get bottom surgery and other medical procedures are very, very lucky. It's hard not to be able to transition at first but it's so much worse when you can't, and never will be able to fully transition.

2020-04-08 06:30:13,fx19pa,0,1,"I posted here previously with...a far watered down version of the real issues at hand, even if it is also part of the equation. Anyway, I know the question sounds silly on its face, and almost definitely is in reality, too, but I can't help but feel this way.

I'm a 20 year old agender (often call myself anarchogender. I think that while trans identities are valid in all forms of course they do often utilize outdated gender roles and I think the end goal of gender issues should be to abolish the societal concept of gender wholesale but thats ANOTHER can of worms), and I am in a safe, positive, LGBT healthy environment. There's not a single cisstraight person in my entire group of friends. There's no danger to me for coming out as a transwoman.

But I have fears that it might be...immoral? Sexist? Transphobic? For me to be a transwoman.

First off, one of my friends is a transwoman, and I feel like I'd be stealing her thunder by also coming out as a transwoman. I've felt this way lowkey for a long time, long before she ever came out so its not like that influenced this decision, but I could still be seen as encroaching on her individuality, especially if I clarify Um Actually I Felt Trans Looong Before You Did :).

From here it gets. Darker. So, trigger warning for discussions of child sexual assault and related topics. Bail out now if you aren't in the headspace to deal with that.

Anyway, I already feel immoral for being amab and into men, because I was sexually assaulted by a man as a child. This makes me a dead ringer for the dumb, incorrect, and awful stereotype that Gays Rape Kids To Make Em Gay that so many bigots bandy about. But uh. That trauma, and the way I dealt with it (read : made it far worse) in my tween and teen years...it made me develop a rape fetish. I have never and would never hurt anyone like that. The only time I've hurt anyone in my life was when I got into a fistfight with a nazi in a walmart bathroom. I only believe in violence of any kind when it's justice or self defense, and rape, obviously, can never be either of those things. Regardless, I would still be a dead wringer for the bigot's strawman of the Trans Predator. And I don't know if I'm comfortable giving them ammo like that.

Third, and this ties back into my anxiety re:trans issues and gender role abolishment and the quasi-contradiction between the two movements, my ideal posture/gait is like..........for lack of a better word, some have called it slutty? Hip cocked when standing idly, ass-heavy walking, etc. The best description I can give is it's kinda like [Meryl's walk/run cycle from MGS1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyuqbm4LTcI). Would me, taking these actions and declaring myself Woman, not be sexist of me? As if that's the definition of a woman?

Fourth, I'm an amateur essayist/podcaster/streamer, and the Gamer Transgirl Streamer is another stereotype that I'm anxious about proliferating. Sure, that one is FAR less harmful, and obviously that's a common trend because people who are online a lot are more likely to be exposed to information re:gender issues and more likely to discuss it online and thus discover they're trans, but still.

I am nearly 14 years old, and due to my age, I will be unable to transition or even go on blockers until I move out.
Why?
Simple.
My parents, siblings, grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. would disown me. And that's if I was even allowed to transition.

I tried speaking to my mom about how I felt once a few months ago. It, however, did not go well. She said she wanted to put me into therapy. I thought that would be great, it meant I could finally speak to someone who could help me start my transition.
I was wrong.
The only reason she wanted me in therapy in the first place was for the therapist to ""make me not trans.""
It doesn't matter, she never ended up putting me in therapy in the first place.

It causes me great pain knowing that I am in the middle of male puberty and unable to do anything about it.

2020-04-11 00:58:27,fyt7bx,6,1,"I'm 23, and I've recently started very seriously considering transitioning (mtf). 

I hope this sort of thing is allowed here, I didn't see anything about it in the rules.

 I've got a lot of questions, reoccurring thoughts etc that are driving me insane, and I have no one I can talk to about this other than my therapist who I sadly cannot speak to because of the pandemic situation. 

Some of these are very intimate questions, questions that I feel a bit silly for asking but they have all been nagging at me for the past few months. Even if you have an answer or opinion on only one of them I'd be very greatful if you'd comment and let me know. Even if it's just a couple of words. 

If anything I say is insensitive please also let me know. The last thing I want to do is upset anyone. 

Is it abnormal that I want to transition but I don't like typicaly feminine clothes very much? I've never had the urge to cross dress before. The thought of wearing things like dresses and skirts still feels a bit wrong, like it's not for me. I imagine I would still wear mostly androgynous or masculine clothes. 

It's more my body shape and face that just feels very wrong, less so the clothes. I hate what I see in the mirror. I feel physically uncomfortable when naked. I have a strong desire for the shape to be more feminine, smooth and curvy. Does this just mean I'm a man that wants to look more feminine? 

Will HRT make my body more ""fit"" for wearing feminine clothes like womens jeans, womens shirts etc? When I see them in shops I'm pretty sure they just wouldn't fit right on my current frame. I've never tried them on, so I could be mistaken. 

Is it abnormal that I want to keep my pp? I'm quite squeamish. Especially about that area of my body, partly due to some childhood trauma. The thought of bottom surgery makes me feel deeply uneasy. I'd like to hear from people who have opted out of bottom surgery and people that have had it. 

I've read a bit about how mtf hormone therapy decreases and changes sexual urges. I know that the penis will become less hard when erect, and may suffer atrophy from disuse so to speak. 

Just how much do the sexual urges decrease and change? Is it radically different for everyone? Will I never want to Fap again? Will I miss my urges to Fap that I had before hrt? I'm curious about the specifics, if someone could tell me how much their urges and habits decreased that would help me. 

Does hrt make the male genitals hurt or feel uncomfortable or strange in any way? I've heard that the scrotum migrates upwards. That sounds a bit uncomfortable. 

Are all of these together a big red flag that I might regret transitioning somewhere down the line?

In what ways can HRT effect me psychologically and emotionally? I'm a bit unstable and irritable as it is. I feel a mix of deep emotions for things that I shouldn't and distant apathy for things I should care about. Is that relevant to this?

I'm 23, and to me that sounds ancient. I often get into depressive episodes where I feel like it's far far too late. Like even if I did pass I'd be beyond my best days. Do people who transition late have a significantly harder time passing? Do they have a higher rate of detransitioning?

I've got some of the typical traits that trans women talk about having. For the past 5 or so years I often lamented that I wasn't born a woman. Yet it never occurred to me that I could be transgender until I watched a contrapoints video on gender dysphoria. A lot of it really resonated with me. So much so that I broke down in tears. It was the first ""oh fuck I could be transgender"" moment that I had.

This is all a disjointed mess of a post. But that's what my mind feels like right now. I'm having trouble processing and organising my own thoughts.

So...

I had written a huuuuuge text talking about the many changes I have experienced these past two weeks but‚Ä¶ the page decided to automatically refresh and I lost everything I had written. And, trust me, the text was long. \*sigh\* I usually write posts on Notes first to avoid these issues. But, this time, I did not and now Safari is laughing at my misery.

.

I apologize but I won‚Äôt write everything again. Worry not though. I‚Äôll most likely refer to it all in the near future. However, please feel free to ask whatever you wish. I will happily answer.

Now here‚Äôs the uh... photoshoot.

Quarantine boredom makes a person do this kind of thing. It‚Äôs been so long since I had a face-to-face conversation with another human being. Covid-19.

\*sigh\*

I would like to add that I had never even attempted to look ‚Äúsexy‚Äù (or whatever you wanna call it) in a picture. This is a great step towards self acceptance! Yay to that.

Please don‚Äôt be fooled though. I am still a pure soul and have no intention of entering the pornography business.

But yes, here it goes, 25/03/2020 (1st day on T) vs 10/04/2020 (morning, afternoon, evening). Excited for the many more changes to come. Hopefully, I won‚Äôt turn out a Danny DeVito. Not a wish of mine. Sorry, Danny.

Oh! I have invited my newly formed Adam‚Äôs apple to pose with me. I hope you won‚Äôt mind. I just didn‚Äôt want to do it alone, too shy for that. Oh and a wider waist and a now more squared jaw ended up joining me as well. It was quite a T party.

Don‚Äôt know if this is important or not but I‚Äôm currently 25 years old.

He has very strict fam so there is no way he can live his life as gay or woman etc. 
but he also enjoy his self as man and never doubt his male identity. When he is man he likes to be bulky and he has very masculine personality. But once is a while usually 1/2 weeks especially when he is stressed or overwhelmed, wanna runaway from current situation ( that‚Äôs what I noticed) his fem aside take him over. And he can be weak and don‚Äôt need to worry anything. Also if he doesn‚Äôt have any fam or friend, in some world he could have life as fem which he get boob surgery but still want keep penis, but then he also doesn‚Äôt wanna lose his current life as completely man.

Hey, so I‚Äôm not trans or anything but I have a trans male friend (ftm) who told me he wanted to start learning to dance with me since we‚Äôre all stuck at home.

What do you guys think? Can certain dances trigger your dysphoria?

And my grandparents that i live with haven‚Äôt brought anything up, so I don‚Äôt know if they have even read the message or are just choosing to ignore it.

I asked him how an important part of me is an adult issue that i should hide from everyone and he refused to answer 

He repeated that im exposing my brother to an extremely inappropriate adult situation and im a bad person because I don‚Äôt care. Mind you, my brother was one of the first people i came out to, and he‚Äôs one of my best friends ( as sad as that may sound ) 

I told my dad that everyone else responded well, and that I didn‚Äôt think i would have gotten a bad reaction or I wouldn‚Äôt have come out, but seemingly everyone else supports me

I‚Äôm male 20 but for the past week I‚Äôve been really thinking about myself and what I want to be.

Over time I noticed a lot of my tendencies of preferring female to male. I don‚Äôt like making male characters in games because I just don‚Äôt like playing as them and I don‚Äôt feel it to be purely because I‚Äôm attracted to women.

When I see women online in sexy pictures it‚Äôs not a sexual feeling. I feel envious. I don‚Äôt relate to my body and don‚Äôt find it sexual in any way. And thinking about getting fit and being a big muscle bound man just doesn‚Äôt feel right. I‚Äôm envious of those women‚Äôs curves and figure.

Months ago I started following this girl on twitter because I liked her only fans pictures and a while later I saw a post showing she was actually trans male to female. And it just sort of awoke this curiosity if I could do that

I don‚Äôt know what I want. When I think about treatments it makes me anxious and worried. Worried it would be a mistake or people wouldn‚Äôt accept me. My friends and I used to laugh at people that feel like me but now I feel like that.

Another aspect is that my girlfriend has expressed the idea that she feels more masculine and might want to act on that. I‚Äôm still attracted to women and it would be extremely difficult to tell someone I love ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to translation but I‚Äôm not attracted to men so I‚Äôd prefer you don‚Äôt‚Äù.

I've had a strange path on my way to becoming MtF. Ever since I was about 10, I always wanted to be a girl. I still felt cis, and felt comfortable as a male, but just wished that I could die and be reborn as a female. From what I've read, this may sound familiar to some of you :P

The only issue is that when I was younger, I was just completely uneducated on the subject, and said some really offensive things. I made the attack helicopter jokes when they were big. Also, somehow for a long time it only registered that FtM people existed, because I had multiple friends who had done that transition (who my mom told me they were just going through a phase, and they just didn't know what they were doing with their bodies. (one of those friends transitioned almost 7 years ago and is still Christopher.) coming out to my mom was a whole lot of fun with that mindset...) so it just never occurred to me that I'd be able to be trans.

Even once I started questioning myself a few years ago, I still just didn't understand what I was talking about. I told my cousin that I ""wanted to be a ***trap***, but was too afraid of my dad to do it"" (which, the dad fear is a dreary story for another day) and was under the misconception that if I wanted to, I could just go to the doctor and ask for hormone supplements.

The internet and school does an awful job portraying trans people, and I blame the fact the I took so long to realize I'm trans (and still constantly having days where I feel like I'm not) on just how poorly I was taught how this stuff works.

However, I'm lucky to have such a great girlfriend who is very familiar with LGBTQ+ stuff, and was able to help me find who I was. I spent a day at her house putting on her makeup and having her call me she/her, and it felt like the first time I'd been truly happy in years.

And though I still have days where I think ""oh, I've just talked myself into this, none of these feelings are true"" or ""I wasn't born a girl, I just wish I was one. That's not how trans works"", I'm able to just look back at that day with my girlfriend and see how happy that made me. I can notice the wave of euphoria I get from something as simple as crossing my legs or wearing girl's jeans.

I've only recognized myself as trans for a little over a month (a week before quarantine. yikes.) but I've felt this way for years. It feels so nice to tell my process of going from a slightly transphobic preteen to a trans person. And even though I've been feeling really depressed lately, any time someone calls me pretty or cute, or uses my pronouns, or calls me by my new name (Ivy), I just feel like I finally belong.

I'm still having trouble learning what the correct things to say are, and just staying PC after being in a household that is anything but. But I'm trying my best, constantly reading lgbt subreddits and just taking notes of the do's and don'ts.

My problem is, i want top surgery desperately, and while hes not terribly happy about it, he genuinely understands that it will help me feel better about my body image and my sense of self. I also want to take T for a short time maybe a year or 2 so i can gain some body and facial hair, and also lower my voice permanently. I know what the other effects are and are fine with them, and i know i defenitely dont want to fully transition, just look more masculine without all the effort i go through now.

This is the part he is very not ok with and he says its because in his past he was bullied severely (like beaten by several people) about being gay even though he isnt, and it was so bad it made him confused about his sexuality for a while. Because of this he is afraid of people thinking hes gay now, and doesnt want me to be male passing.

I know his fears are valid but he wont even have a discussion with me about it so i can explain myself. I dont want to look *male* just more androgynous.

Age- 12 Anyways. So i knew for a while that i was trans. Even  at this age I was looking it up, and then one day i was watching ""But i'm just a Cheerleader"" I watched the lesbians on the movie and i immediately thought ""Wait why can't i be like that"" Because i honestly never really cared for guys. Girls are cute. I wanna be cute.

Age 16- My dad only really loved me when i won something in a wrestling match or football. I Was pretty good at those, especially wrestling. I was top in the state for mn. Literally just to try to get some good attention from my dad. ME and my mom due to her abusive behavior when she drank, we stopped talking. The only way i stay sane is to dress up and take pictures so I can see myself as how i feel.

When i came out in high school my only good friend, my best friend and 3 other people beat me up and left me in a snowy ditch outside of my town. After my dad kicked me out and i was homeless at 17.

Age 21- I went back into the closet and tried to make my dad proud by not being trans so in return I have to party like everyday due to my complete denial and depression.

Age 24 (1 months on HRT)- I was with a women for 2 years, had a ring I was paying off. Hold deal. Then one day i can't stand how unhappy i still am so i tell her i want to transition. and she said it was okay. I went to a informed consent doctor and got the medication  Well She broke up with me and I find out she had been cheating on me for our whole relationship. I was devastated. But like even with all of that i  realized i was finally doing it and i can be myself now.

I live in the UK, and obviously the same rules don't apply here and people aren't usually able to read a certain gender based on my name - there are several girls' names ending in 'n' - Megan, Cathleen, etc.

2020-04-14 00:25:43,g0v5k8,5,3,"So my girlfriend and I recently broke up and despite it being a year long relationship I'm not as sad about it as I would expect to be. We might have been good for each other at the start but at some point she just started only wanting to veg out whenever we spent time together watch a Disney movie without touching and then go on phones, watch the office without touching and then go on phones. Those kinda *spending time together*s.

Anyway we'd been discussing our compatibility for a while and she said something that really took the wind put of me given that she was bi or pan and very out about that (attended LGBTQ+ drinks at our college every week). She said that she wasn't sure if we were compatible because she wasn't romantically attracted to women, only sexually. 

Now we'd been together for a year and she had never said anything about that and I came out to her very early on in our relationship (ie the first month) and obviously that's valid but as a transbian who currently just looks like a man and am pre-srs I had kinda considered bi women to be the only real safe bet for long term relationships because I wouldn't have to worry about their attraction to me now or their attraction to me post-srs and ffs. 

But I am now finding out that this is not uncommon, a lot of people seem to have this experience of bi women being not attracted to women romantically or rather bi women discovering that they need their partner to be playing male gender roles. Which now means I'm kinda out of options. I don't want to wait until I've had all the surgery I need before I can date anyone. 

I also don't want to date someone who identifies as lesbian because as I said it's not just what's between my legs my face is very male and so is my body and so it's very unlikely they would find me attractive and I don't really want the awkward *oh sorry I'm actually a lesbian* exchange. And I now feel like dating bi women is almost worse because I have no idea (and if my ex is anything to go by many of them also have no idea) whether they will be interested in a romantic relationship with me because they haven't experienced dating someone without clear gender roles for each partner to follow so they may just decide after a few months that it isn't working for them. 

I know there is no solution here and no one is at fault it's just frustrating knowing that while hookup culture has been great for helping people explore their sexuality hence the increase in people realising they are bi, it has if anything hindered exploration of their romantivity hence those people not knowing if that applies just to sex or to a relationship.

And as someone who is only gonna be romantically attractive to people romantically attracted to women, and needs to be sexually attractive to people sexually attracted to men and women, that kinda sucks.

We might have been good for each other at the start but at some point she just started only wanting to veg out whenever we spent time together watch a Disney movie without touching and then go on phones, watch the office without touching and then go on phones. Those kinda *spending time together*s.\n\nAnyway we'd been discussing our compatibility for a while and she said something that really took the wind put of me given that she was bi or pan and very out about that (attended LGBTQ+ drinks at our college every week). She said that she wasn't sure if we were compatible because she wasn't romantically attracted to women, only sexually. \n\nNow we'd been together for a year and she had never said anything about that and I came out to her very early on in our relationship (ie the first month) and obviously that's valid but as a transbian who currently just looks like a man and am pre-srs I had kinda considered bi women to be the only real safe bet for long term relationships because I wouldn't have to worry about their attraction to me now or their attraction to me post-srs and ffs. \n\nBut I am now finding out that this is not uncommon, a lot of people seem to have this experience of bi women being not attracted to women romantically or rather bi women discovering that they need their partner to be playing male gender roles. Which now means I'm kinda out of options. I don't want to wait until I've had all the surgery I need before I can date anyone. \n\nI also don't want to date someone who identifies as lesbian because as I said it's not just what's between my legs my face is very male and so is my body and so it's very unlikely they would find me attractive and I don't really want the awkward *oh sorry I'm actually a lesbian* exchange. And I now feel like dating bi women is almost worse because I have no idea (and if my ex is anything to go by many of them also have no idea) whether they will be interested in a romantic relationship with me because they haven't experienced dating someone without clear gender roles for each partner to follow so they may just decide after a few months that it isn't working for them. \n\nI know there is no solution here and no one is at fault it's just frustrating knowing that while hookup culture has been great for helping people explore their sexuality hence the increase in people realising they are bi, it has if anything hindered exploration of their romantivity hence those people not knowing if that applies just to sex or to a relationship.\n\nAnd as someone who is only gonna be romantically attractive to people romantically attracted to women, and needs to be sexually attractive to people sexually attracted to men and women, that kinda sucks. Maybe society needs to encourage people to talk about and explore their romantic orientation as well as their sexual orientation to save the time of a year long relationship. Maybe people should start identifying themselves as hetero-romantic bi-romantic homo-romantic pan-romantic etc rather than just the sexual side of that. \n\nMaybe this is a small problem which only really applies to me and I should shut up and stop suggesting a major cultural and linguistic shift especially when some people still don't know which way round trans women and trans men are or even that drag queens and trans women are different."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': '*rant*', 'created': 1586849143.0}"

Ch.1: Storytime.

My trans journey started very recently, technically speaking. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome out‚Äù until I was 30. It was a very bumpy road for many reasons, and still is, but I think understanding the journey is half the battle of knowing the story.

I knew something was ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù at a very early age. I don‚Äôt remember a lot of my developmental age before high school for one reason or another but I do know that I always graduated towards the feminine. Without getting too into personal history I knew I was supposed to be a girl as early as 11. Looking back knowing what I know now, a lot of what seemed at the time as odd behavior makes sense in the context. Sometime during my mid teen years is when I finally had just enough personal freedom to start experimenting with clothing and makeup, and every time I felt that *twinge.* Those of you who have had similar experiences know what I‚Äôm talking about. At the time it was nothing to pay mind to and I carried on. One year turned into another, one chapter of my life produced the next, all the while I kept kicking the can down the road or trying to cover it up. At best my ‚Äúcrossdressing‚Äù was just something weird that I did or ‚Äúsomething I used to do.‚Äù Sometimes life got in the way. If I was busy enough, or if I was surrounded with the right people, or distracted enough I didn‚Äôt have the twinge. But when I was alone, ah, there it was. I won‚Äôt go into the details for fear of being too ‚Äúpoor me‚Äù about it, maybe I‚Äôll write about it later, maybe I won‚Äôt.

As I grew older and took less of other people to construct myself I was forced through my own shortcomings as a person to look inward and find out who I am, independently of other people. I wasn‚Äôt happy in my relationships, not because the other party in those relationships weren‚Äôt making me happy, but because I wasn‚Äôt happy. I had to take the time to realize why I wasn‚Äôt and rectify that in order to be a good friend, significant other, coworker, etc, instead of a toxic swamp that fed off the happiness of others without offering any of my own. I spent a lot of time in the following year-or-so alone, not alone in the ‚Äúby myself‚Äù sense, but more in the ‚Äúwith myself‚Äù sense, working through my feelings and being forced to examine why I felt that way. As I‚Äôve mentioned before, when I don‚Äôt have anything else distracting me I have the *twinge*.

Having no real social engagements to speak of to keep me from doing such things, I decided at the time to indulge that *twinge*. I enjoyed it when I was younger and there‚Äôs no real reason I couldn‚Äôt at the time, so I did. I had purged all my girly things a few years before, a cycle a lot of trans folk have experience with, so I had to start all over. Buying my clothes, new makeup, relearning old techniques and learning new ones. I loved all these things, It was a welcome distraction from the constant self-philosophy I was otherwise performing. What I didn‚Äôt know at the time is it was making me happy, I didn‚Äôt know how or why, but I knew I felt different, not bad, and no one told me to stop. So I kept going.

Eventually my mental health and relationship with myself improved, and as I made my progress my ‚Äúcrossdressing‚Äù (as I referred to it at the time), was ingrained with that, It was something I could look forward to, something I could enjoy and experiment with. At the same time I could share that through the power of the internet. I started sharing on various platforms and most importantly **EDITED** (something we‚Äôll get to later) and the feedback I received compounded the happiness I developed throughout the process. So I kept going.

Until early last year‚Ä¶ I went about my business as it had developed over the last 5 or so years with the same routine. The same repeating rigamarole of work all week, come home Friday, shave, get pretty, and party. I hadn‚Äôt really paid too much attention as to why I did, I just did. It was my favorite part of my week. I could drink, decompress from work, and flounce about online carefree. In those moments nothing else mattered. At the time it was the closest thing I had to a hobby. 

Then everything shifted, I shifted. I had an earth shattering life experience that I was not-at-all prepared for. During one of the weekend rituals everything was going according to plan until for some odd reason I took just a second too long looking at my reflection in the mirror and I just‚Ä¶. cracked. I just started crying, the kind of deep crying, the kind that pours out of your soul.

For the first time in my life that I could remember I was happy, truly happy. I was pretty, I was euphoric, I was who I was supposed to be this whole time.

I was‚Ä¶ Reborn.

It was then I decided, I knew I had to do this. I had to be honest to myself, to others about who I was, what I wanted, where I wanted to go. It was exciting. For the first time in presumably ever I had a goal, a real personal driving force to propel me into the future. I made my preparations, I changed my name, over the next few months I came out to my friends and coworkers. Eventually I started presenting to the world as myself, being bolder and going out more as myself. I started doing my research on how to proceed with my transition and trying to figure out how to navigate this minefield I had knowingly walked headfirst into. It was an adventure, it was exciting, something to look forward to, it was fun.

Until it wasn‚Äôt.

The overall point of this work is not to just tell my personal story, it is to share a viewpoint and open that viewpoint for discussion. Understanding how I developed that viewpoint is as important as what that viewpoint is so I opened with the story of how I got to where I am.

It'll make more sense in context once the other chapters are written and finalized.

I‚Äôm not being insensitive, mean or disrespectful to the trans community, but it‚Äôs easier for me to explain in blunt language.

&amp;#x200B;

Now‚Ä¶..

&amp;#x200B;

First, I‚Äôm a handsome, masculine cis gay black man, total top, late 30‚Äôs.  I‚Äôm usually in a long-term monogamous relationship with other cis gay masculine men.  I‚Äôve never bottomed, have no desire to bottom, and don‚Äôt care for dick.

&amp;#x200B;

Dating has been ok for me; it‚Äôs easier because I‚Äôm masculine and most people don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gay, which gay men love.  My problem is that I‚Äôm only attracted to masculine total bottom men, which is extremely hard to find.  What‚Äôs even harder is that most guys I‚Äôm attracted to are either verse or verse tops, which, for me, doesn‚Äôt work.  I‚Äôm not the least bit interested in sucking dick, getting fucked or even jacking a man‚Äôs dick.

&amp;#x200B;

About 8 years ago (maybe longer), I‚Äôm having a random dating conversation with a friend I‚Äôve known for over 20 years, and he asked me what would make me happy.  My answer, without thinking, was that I wished men had a pussy.  I‚Äôd love it if I could be with a nice-looking dude, but sexually, I‚Äôd want him to have a pussy because having a dick bounce up and down on my stomach when a guy is riding me is annoying.  We both laughed‚Ä¶.and then‚Ä¶.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend said why don‚Äôt you date an FTM?  I‚Äôm like, what‚Äôs that?  He enlightened me, showed me a couple of pics on Google and it was almost like eureka!

&amp;#x200B;

I like men, but I like pussy, if that makes sense.  I like the way pussy feels, the way it smells, the way it looks when my dick goes in and out, playing and licking the clit, everything.  But I like the look and masculinity of a man.  The beard, the ‚Äúman ass‚Äù as I call it, etc..

&amp;#x200B;

I like to make love and fuck, but the idea of fucking a guy in the ass long term just gets boring after a while because you always have to wait for them to ‚Äúprepare,‚Äù and sometimes they want head and I‚Äôm just not the one.  I‚Äôm not verse at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve only met a handful of FTM, but they seem to only date cis women, but take dick every now and then.  How would I go about finding an FTM who is not only masculine looking (I don‚Äôt care about voice), but has his ‚Äúoriginal plumbing‚Äù (I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs had top surgery or not) and genuinely wants and like dick inside of them?

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúchaser‚Äù.  I actually hate that term.  I just would love to be in a long term, monogamous relationship with a FTM.  Hell, I‚Äôd even get married if we fell hard for each other.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Washington, DC, where I thought it would be easy, but it‚Äôs hard as hell. SMH. Any advice?

So I made a throwaway cuz I‚Äôm scared that people IRL might know my user &amp; irdk what I‚Äôm even thinking but I need to know what you lovely people think. 

Im gay, always have been. Never been interested in women romantically but always thought they were pretty and had nice hair and smelled good. I always thought that it was awesome how many choices they had to express themselves... they can wear skirts or pants or dresses or dress up or dress down and always look feminine and soft and approachable no matter what. They can wear all the makeup they want and nobody looks at them funny. I want to be able to express myself like that.

I know men can wear makeup now, like it‚Äôs 2020 it‚Äôs no big deal. But maybe it‚Äôs not normal to want to wear makeup and dresses for a guy? Idk... but I also want to be soft and curvy and like, be taken care of like a girl. I want boys to lift heavy things and open doors for me. I want to be able to cry and not have people look at me like I‚Äôm cray cray lol. I want straight boys to look my way ü§§ 

But then I tell myself, like if it‚Äôs only about wearing pretty girly clothes and dresses and makeup, maybe that‚Äôs just me stereotyping girls? Like maybe I‚Äôm not a girl but I just like the ‚Äúhelpless princess‚Äù archetype too much? Maybe that‚Äôs not what being a girls about since there‚Äôs so many girls I know that aren‚Äôt even like that? 

Like how do you know when you FEEL like a girl? Or if it‚Äôs just that you really like girls? I‚Äôve never felt like a man or even a boy but maybe that‚Äôs because I should be a girl? I know I‚Äôm not like, a manly man obviously... I don‚Äôt feel like a dude or a bro... but like I don‚Äôt hate my penis? I wouldn‚Äôt mind having a vagina so that I could have better penetration cuz I‚Äôm not crazy about anal but idk if that‚Äôs a good enough reason

I‚Äôm sorry for the long post ladies I‚Äôm just kind of high and really confused. If this didn‚Äôt make sense I‚Äôm sorry. Do you all think I could be trans? Or am I just a total queer weirdo lol?

Quick thing to mention is that I have severe anxiety fits that produces a severe itching sensation each time I get one, and it's also a thing with my dysphoria, so it's hard to tell which is which. Anyway, my mom died 4 years ago. I had moved in with my grandparents, but because of the way I am, I was getting emotionally, physically, and sexually abused there. My grandparents have told me they hated me, tried to convert me, made death threats to me, and have actually tried to kill me multiple times to the point where I made multiple suicide attempts. 

Anyway, I left there last year to live with my brother because CPS found out when my uncle caught my grandmother threatening me with a knife to me, asking me how should she kill me, and I finally moved in with my brother, who out of all my siblings, was the only one that had completely neglected my past trauma and issues and was emotionally abusing me, because again, I'm a black trans and pansexual male who supposedly ""brings down the strong black male community"" as my grandfather once said. I'm now living with my boyfriend, who's trans, and their parent. 

My boyfriend is starting testosterone soon, and to be honest, I'm a little jealous, because I have no health care, my brother has not given me my birth certificate to get my healthcare, and somehow on the bright side, I'm still getting my social security disability checks because of my anxiety as well as me being a minor when my mom passed.

My grandparents have told me they hated me, tried to convert me, made death threats to me, and have actually tried to kill me multiple times to the point where I made multiple suicide attempts. \n\nAnyway, I left there last year to live with my brother because CPS found out when my uncle caught my grandmother threatening me with a knife to me, asking me how should she kill me, and I finally moved in with my brother, who out of all my siblings, was the only one that had completely neglected my past trauma and issues and was emotionally abusing me, because again, I\'m a black trans and pansexual male who supposedly ""brings down the strong black male community"" as my grandfather once said. I\'m now living with my boyfriend, who\'s trans, and their parent. \n\nMy boyfriend is starting testosterone soon, and to be honest, I\'m a little jealous, because I have no health care, my brother has not given me my birth certificate to get my healthcare, and somehow on the bright side, I\'m still getting my social security disability checks because of my anxiety as well as me being a minor when my mom passed. Anyways (again), I have no way to get estrogen at all, and I heard of people in the trans community that give shots up or estrogen pills or patches. I want to do DIY hormones, but I don\'t have anyone willing to hook me up.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Help :/', 'created': 1587149458.0}"

I tried to argument, that as it is an anomaly that impacts my life in a negative manner, it could very well be called an illness. I told them, that if there was some kind of pill, that could make me (MTF) a normal Man, I would would take it, as it is my goal to end my gender dysphoria, and not necessarily to be a woman. They replied by saying that they wouldn't change who they are, even if that means taking the hard run.

But what do you think? Would you take the easy way, even if it means losing a part of yourself? Or would you  rather have to go through years of hard work, if that's what it takes, to be truly yourself?

2020-04-19 05:37:35,g42di6,2,1,"Hey Im 14 and I‚Äôm confused about my gender. I felt like maybe here I could get some advice.

I‚Äôve thought for a few years I‚Äôm a lesbian but most of the stuff I‚Äôm gonna say isn‚Äôt related to sexuality but I feel like it‚Äôs kinda related. Over the past year or so I‚Äôve started to get confused about my gender. Obviously with puberty I‚Äôve started my period and starting developing breasts and when I see my breast I just want them gone. It doesn‚Äôt feel like they should be there. That part is probably just hormones but please continue reading. And obviously no one likes periods so it would make sense if I‚Äôm uncomfortable with them.

Unrelated to my physical body I don‚Äôt know if I feel like a girl anymore. But I never felt like this before so what if I‚Äôm just over thinking and it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm a bit of a Tom boy. And I like dresses, I like competitive dancing(which I know guys can do but still if I was trans it‚Äôs be a bit weird in my opinion), I like girly things, my favorite color is purple and I like makeup but I don‚Äôt feel like a girl. It‚Äôs probably just hormones but I‚Äôm so confused I just want to know if this could be a sign. I wanna cut my hair short too which could have to do with being a Tom boy too. 

 But I don‚Äôt dress like a guy. What do guys even wear? I have no idea. 

  I‚Äôm not into boyish things I just kinda am a Tom boy in other ways. 

I don‚Äôt have any male friend either. My entire friend group is lgbtq+ but no one is trans except for one mtf so there‚Äôs no guys in the group.

But why I‚Äôm making this post is over the past year I‚Äôve actually done research and I think I might be a guy. When I think ‚ÄúI am a guy‚Äù I feel better but then the thoughts of ‚Äúno you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre probably just trying to convince yourself for attention. You like girly things‚Äù comes up.

I don‚Äôt know what I would do if I was trans. I‚Äôm very lucky and My family is very open and excepting of the lgbtq+ but they get confused really easily. I have a mtf friend and they get really confused about what pronouns you use if you‚Äôre talking past tense or something (idk how they‚Äôre confused) and they don‚Äôt seem to get it when I try to explain it but I know they‚Äôre trying and my friend understands too.

I‚Äôm probably not trans it might just be in my head. I just thought maybe I could have a little advice. As I said it‚Äôs probably just hormones and overthinking.

And I feel I should also mention while this happens the majority of the time some days I feel completely female I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on so I‚Äôll blame hormones and maybe if I‚Äôm actually trans I‚Äôll realize it one day.

Hey everyone! I am a sophomore in college and a history major. For my final project in my Women in World History course, I am required to interview five women of any subset and compare their experiences to the women that we have read about this semester. Being a trans man myself, I decided that interviewing trans women would make a great paper. With that being said, I unfortunately do not know any trans women in person. I have reached out to my local trans support groups without much of a response. This is my second method of finding interviewees. 

For anyone interested, the interview would be entirely only email or DM (if preferred by interviewee). I do not think that it would take more than 10-20 minutes to complete and would greatly help me out. As a history student, my goal is to write about trans history/topics as much as I can. I believe that we lack representation in all aspects of life, especially history. I would really enjoy dedicating my career to research and write about trans history. 

I would greatly appreciate anyone who chooses to participate. However, I completely understand if not. If interested, feel free to DM me :)

2020-04-20 12:43:09,g4s31w,10,1,"Hi /r/trans;

Short version: I'm transitioning in my late thirties, and I'm currently feeling what I can only describe as 'grief' for the years I lost. I'm really struggling to process this, and hoped others had insight as to how to proceed forward.

Long version: it was pretty obvious that I was trans from the early teens onward; but unfortunately, I grew up in a place where that wasn't a lot of representation and I never really connected the dots. I moved to a considerably more permissive city for college, and started to feminize my appearance (while attributing to a 'goth phase'). I was dangerously close to cracking my proverbial egg.

I then met the love of my life; joined her in the Midwest; and brought a wonderful daughter into the world. Between the rather less permissive attitudes in the area, and molding myself into a provider for my family (i.e. embracing my own father's work ethic, but also the masculine ideas that accompanied it) the egg-cracking was permanently shelved.

Over the next fifteen years, things began to change: my wife and daughter both gained trans friends (informing my worldview); I started reading up on the subject. In February of last year, the dam finally broke; and my family have been very supportive as I started transitioning. (I began HRT, at the start of this year, but there were some issues with my levels and I think it's only in the last three weeks it's really beginning to kick in - I also wonder if that's having an effect on my thinking.)

My wife sent me this deeply sweet [comic by @eunnieboo](https://twitter.com/eunnieboo/status/1117607828670173184); showing a couple very much like us growing old together. Unexpectedly, I find myself in an emotional tailspin - I've spent the weekend sobbing uncontrollably; in particular, I keep finding my thoughts return to the last two panels of the second page (where the couple start their relationship, and marry).

I'm not great at making sense of my own emotional state, but the best I can describe how I currently feel is 'bereavement' - as if I'm mourning a timeline that never existed; one where my mind and body were already aligned and I lived as a young woman and mother, not man and father. There's also an undercurrent of anger at the world I grew up in and the unfairness of it keeping me from realizing my true self.

My brother came out at least a year ago and will be starting his medical transition soon. My mother has never voluntarily used his correct pronouns. And I decided that today I was going to give her my full stance on that. 

I browse Reddit on my tablet, I have a flip phone and my tablet camera is awful so you can't get screenshots and my photos of the conversation are horrible. I do have them though. 

I sent her a photo I made where I wrote out on paper in pink pen ""use their Preferred pronouns! It's basic human respect!"" She responded rather quickly.

Mom: ""How entitled are you to demand that the whole English language change and everyone else change how they have spoken their whole life because you demand it.""

Me: ""Last time I checked male pronouns aren't 'grammatically incorrect' and even then neither are gender neutral terms.""

Mom: ""Except that she is not a boy.""

Me: ""Yes he is. If he tells you he wants to be a boy, he's a boy and no amount of prayer is going to change his mind.""

Mom: ""if he/she decides she is an elephant she is not an elephant just because she wants to be."" 

Me: ""a human cannot be an elephant, you're right. But a human can be a boy. He is a real boy. It's so funny how you seem to be reaching for reasons to avoid giving your son the basic human respect he deserves."" 

Mom: ""a person, animal or otherwise you can't change your DNA because you will it."" 

Me: ""they're not trying to change their DNA they just want to be comfortable in their own skin."" 

At the end there I started to get a bit more general, I have a lot of trans and nonbinary friends who my mom has misgendered. It hurts me to hear her using the wrong pronouns on purpose. I want her to know that what she has been doing is disrespectful and wrong.  

My brother is upset that I did this because he doesn't want me to argue with my mom over him. And I do feel bad about that, but this feels like a lot more than just him now. I've talked to my trans friends about it and they said that it made them really happy to see me standing up for my brother so idk. I hope y'all will appreciate it.

2020-04-21 05:40:45,g59isq,0,1,"For about 3 years I've struggled with the thought of being transgender. I've never been necessarily uncomfortable being a guy physically and socially I think I've just been me but I also don't know how much I've been influenced by male expectations. Answering ""who am I really"" is hard because of the masks we wear in life. I've grappled with what I really want for me and have come to messy conclusions. 

Like most of us (amab's) if there was a button to press that could just make me a cis female and my life would be the same except adjusted for being a woman, then I would press it without hesitation. But there isn't and my life won't just adjust. I have a wife who I love more than anything who I know from indirectly questioning would not stay with me if I transitioned, at least as of now. And not that she's transphobic or anything. We could maybe still be friends (if my emotions could allow it) but she would almost assuredly lose the attraction that she honestly deserves in our relationship. And I don't blame her. She married me unaware (as I was at the time) of this part of me.

So I've decided that I will continue to be as I am and get to stay with her because she makes me unbelievably happy. While I don't have strong disphoria towards my body I will suffer from the occasional waved of fantasizing about being in a woman's body, some stronger than others. But that's ok. If I were to be without my wife I estimate that that pain would be much greater. And that's ok because life isn't about not having anything that makes you uncomfortable or causes pain. Should I somehow be separated from my wife be it death or other issues, then I suppose I will return to weigh the options of moving forward with a transition. I do not wish that this occurs just to free me up but as we know, life can throw a mean curveball sometimes so I am not so naive as to think that's not a possibility.

As stated in the title, I'm a 27 year old biological male, and I found out a couple months ago in therapy that I may be a transwoman, or I've at least started questioning my gender. Since then, I've done my best to take care of myself by eating healthy, exercising, meditating, seeing a therapist (she actually suggested I reached out on this subreddit), reached out to my parents about it, but it's been very traumatic, which I'm sure you can all relate to. What I feel alternates between numbness to distressful painful feelings in my heart and feeling trapped/isolated. Thinking about becoming a woman helps alleviate the pain and is liberating, but it's also very scary (especially thinking about surgeries, whether or not I'd pass, what my family would think, etc.). I also still feel lust for women, but thinking about sleeping with them as a man brings up painful feelings. This is pretty painful to deal with, and while I try to be kind to myself when I'm hurting, I still feel pretty hopeless a lot of the time, and that my life isn't going to get any better. I'm having a tough time accepting myself and this situation. Anyways, if anyone has any advice on what I should be doing, or any advice how to cope with this, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I've spend a long time thinking about what my identity really might be, and I still don't have a really conclusive answer. My whole life I've always taken great pride and joy whenever people call me or the things I do feminine, and never really thought about why. Looking at girls/women always makes me feel jealous of the way they look and dress. The amount of times throughout the last few years I've thought to myself that I wish I was born female is too much to count, even before I considered the possibility that I may not be cis.

I've never tried using any pronouns other than male, and I don't feel uncomfortable with the fact that I'm male. I don't know if this makes sense, but it's not that I don't want to be male, but more like I don't want to not be (at least physically) female?

In this section are the NSFW references, skip this section if you're not comfortable with hearing about my more personal stuff.

    Basically since I knew what porn was I've found content involving trans women especially attractive, and I never really realized until recently that, while I am certainly attracted to all women, they were kind of a self-insert for me. Through reading things like doujins with characters who were referred to as ""tr*ps"" (while, once again, still finding them attractive from an outside perspective) I found myself really identifying with them. I recently read a couple manga which featured characters who's sex and gender is male, but enjoy dressing in ""feminine"" clothing, and I never really realized that this was an option? I feel like this last thing was the closest I've gotten to an answer as to my own identity/ideal self. The final thing is that I still don't mind being referred to as male. I have a really submissive personality all around, and I prefer female partners who are more dominant, in a smothering loving way. And despite all that I've said above, I get extremely turned on by hearing ""good boy.""

The amount of times throughout the last few years I've thought to myself that I wish I was born female is too much to count, even before I considered the possibility that I may not be cis.

I've never tried using any pronouns other than male, and I don't feel uncomfortable with the fact that I'm male. I don't know if this makes sense, but it's not that I don't want to be male, but more like I don't want to not be (at least physically) female?

In this italicized section below are the NSFW references, skip this section if you're not comfortable with hearing about my more personal stuff.

* *Basically since I knew what porn was I've found content involving trans women especially attractive, and I never really realized until recently that, while I am certainly attracted to all women, they were kind of a self-insert for me. Through reading things like doujins with characters who were referred to as ""tr\*ps"" (while, once again, still finding them attractive from an outside perspective) I found myself really identifying with them. I recently read a couple manga which featured characters who's sex and gender is male, but enjoy dressing in ""feminine"" clothing, and I never really realized that this was an option? I feel like this last thing was the closest I've gotten to an answer as to my own identity/ideal self. The final thing is that I still don't mind being referred to as male. I have a really submissive personality all around, and I prefer female partners who are more dominant, in a smothering loving way. And despite all that I've said above, I get extremely turned on by hearing ""good boy.""* 

You're clear now lol.

2020-04-23 06:22:43,g6hlrs,3,1,"Hello sorry for the long post.

I know that the title of this post is super vague but hopefully I can explain the really tough situation I am in right now. A situation that I blame myself for mostly.

Before I started college I really was struggling with my gender identity but I sort of bottle it up because I was a bit of an egg and making that decision was super difficult. I'm currently living as a man but I think that a definently have signs of gender dysphoria.

In the past I have bought things like women's clothing ( mostly stuff like Jeans that I could wear in public without people really noticing) and makeup. Which I have enjoyed so much and they make me feel a lot better about myself.

I also am in touch with a counselor on campus who has helped me out with a lot of other stuff but i get really anxious whenever I try to bring up my dysphoric feelings and end up not doing it time and time again whenever we meet.

The really concerning part is that I am the vice president of a fraternity that I am part of which severely complicates things. I dont want to toot my own horn but I'm well known on campus because of this association and within the greek community which is a lot of people. Even if I were to come out with this stuff I dont know how it would go over with so many people who could really make my life a living hell.

Being part of this fraternity has severely limited my ability to test the waters. It is not that anybody in our fraternity is transphobic, in fact we have a lot of brothers who are LGBT and one who is trans. I just feel that I would let a lot of them down with all the responsibilities I carry.

If anybody could provide counsel or share similar experiences that would be super comforting.

2020-04-24 01:31:30,g6zene,4,1,"Hi, I'm a total fool from France writing something completely vague about an anime at 3am. Chances are I'll wake up in 12h, re-read my text and not understand a single thing I just wrote, so please forgive me.

I was wondering what were your opinions on Makoto Shinkai's YOUR NAME./Kimi no Na wa. (2016), a body-swap anime where a teenage girl from the countryside and a teenage boy from Tokyo wake up in the other person's body from time to time. They eventually help each other's lives and fall in love.

What I thought quite remarkable was the presence of random LGBT characters in the background (classmate asking out Mitsuha, Taki's friend finding him ""cute"" while blushing, etc.), yet one can wonder how much sexual orientation is influenced by the pervading masculinity of the female body and feminity of a male body (in short, is Taki's boy-friend sexually attracted to him because taki suddently ""reads gay"" or is he attracted to him because he's falling for Mitsuha, the girl living in Taki's body?). In that light I was wondering if YOUR NAME had a more pansexual philosophy (heck, technically the two protagonists fall in love with themselves instead of each other, what kind of sexuality is that?)

I've always wondered if that subgenre was frowned upon in the LGBT community. I know Sense8 is a vaguely transformed body swap show with extra steps for instance, and I thought it worked wonderfully! But I can also see the limits in the discourse (it first establishes a binary world, that may or may not slowly become non-binary as time goes by, depending on the story).

2020-04-25 01:58:25,g7ldku,1,1,"A while back, a friend came out to me as gay. Despite being part of a wider friend group, we‚Äôre particularly close. He only came out to me, and asked me to keep it between us for now. He said just needed someone other than himself to know. I can tell it‚Äôs like a weight lifted from his shoulders even though he still feels like he can‚Äôt come out any further. He knows that there‚Äôs at least one person who supports him and is able to come to me to talk about his worries, which seems to have given him a boost.

This has, in the end, brought us even closer, which is great‚Äîexcept that I‚Äôm keeping a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù of my own, which feels increasingly terrible the closer our friendship gets. Several times recently he‚Äôs said that ‚Äúit‚Äôs so great to have found the kind of friendship where we feel able to share anything.‚Äù And yet I am not being equally as open, and I hate it.

The trouble is is that the thing that I have to share is, it seems, a lot harder to keep ""just between us."" Namely: that I‚Äôm trans. When he came out as gay to me, I affirmed him, and said I‚Äôd always be there to support him‚Äîbut there hasn't been anything more external that would ever give away either the fact that I knew, or the larger fact that he was gay. In thinking about coming out as trans, though, I know there are all kinds of external things one might want to do to affirm that (things that I of course would love to happen), with being called by a different name and different pronouns at the top of the list. 

Like my friend wanting to keep his sexuality close to his chest, I‚Äôm nowhere near ready to share this more widely. But I‚Äôm terrified that the things he might want to do to be supportive if I similarly come out just to him will ultimately give me away. There was a post along those lines on some trans subreddit recently, which basically said that, unless different parts of your life are totally separate, it‚Äôs too big of a risk to try to only come out to some people. All my friend has to do is accidentally use my correct pronouns to any one of our many transphobic teachers, or to one of the friends that I don‚Äôt yet quite have a read on, and then the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.

Thus I feel stuck in my own closet, unable to really meet him fully in this totally open friendship‚Äîwhich really sucks. I want to have that! I want to have someone to decompress to after a day of being misgendered. I want to be able to share my insecurity about my hands, or my hips, and have him understand it. Recently, I mentioned in passing that I hated a new coat because it was too long (it accentuates my hips :/) and, with all the greatest intentions in the world, he kept reassuring me that long coats looked great on me. I wish I could let him in on the secret that would help him understand why his attempt to be helpful is ultimately painful‚Äîand I know he would understand.

What can I do? Can I tell him how I‚Äôm feeling but that I want to stay entirely closeted for now‚Äîincluding asking him to keep using ‚Äúshe‚Äù pronouns? I would hate to put him in a position where he would feel like he‚Äôs actively harming me by having to talk about me in a way he knows is wrong, and I'm scared about how well even a supportive person could handle that dissonance over time. But my god, if I just had someone to exchange a glance with when feeling particularly dysphoric, or someone to talk to about how I'm feeling........ I don‚Äôt know what kind of a trade off that is.

Any advice? I just wish it could be the same for me as it is for him :/",trans,Want to come out--sort of--help?

He knows that there‚Äôs at least one person who supports him and is able to come to me to talk about his worries, which seems to have given him a boost.\n\nThis has, in the end, brought us even closer, which is great‚Äîexcept that I‚Äôm keeping a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù of my own, which feels increasingly terrible the closer our friendship gets. Several times recently he‚Äôs said that ‚Äúit‚Äôs so great to have found the kind of friendship where we feel able to share anything.‚Äù And yet I am not being equally as open, and I hate it.\n\nThe trouble is is that the thing that I have to share is, it seems, a lot harder to keep ""just between us."" Namely: that I‚Äôm trans. When he came out as gay to me, I affirmed him, and said I‚Äôd always be there to support him‚Äîbut there hasn\'t been anything more external that would ever give away either the fact that I knew, or the larger fact that he was gay. In thinking about coming out as trans, though, I know there are all kinds of external things one might want to do to affirm that (things that I of course would love to happen), with being called by a different name and different pronouns at the top of the list. \n\nLike my friend wanting to keep his sexuality close to his chest, I‚Äôm nowhere near ready to share this more widely. But I‚Äôm terrified that the things he might want to do to be supportive if I similarly come out just to him will ultimately give me away. There was a post along those lines on some trans subreddit recently, which basically said that, unless different parts of your life are totally separate, it‚Äôs too big of a risk to try to only come out to some people. All my friend has to do is accidentally use my correct pronouns to any one of our many transphobic teachers, or to one of the friends that I don‚Äôt yet quite have a read on, and then the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.\n\nThus I feel stuck in my own closet, unable to really meet him fully in this totally open friendship‚Äîwhich really sucks. I want to have that! I want to have someone to decompress to after a day of being misgendered. I want to be able to share my insecurity about my hands, or my hips, and have him understand it. Recently, I mentioned in passing that I hated a new coat because it was too long (it accentuates my hips :/) and, with all the greatest intentions in the world, he kept reassuring me that long coats looked great on me. I wish I could let him in on the secret that would help him understand why his attempt to be helpful is ultimately painful‚Äîand I know he would understand.\n\nWhat can I do? Can I tell him how I‚Äôm feeling but that I want to stay entirely closeted for now‚Äîincluding asking him to keep using ‚Äúshe‚Äù pronouns? I would hate to put him in a position where he would feel like he‚Äôs actively harming me by having to talk about me in a way he knows is wrong, and I\'m scared about how well even a supportive person could handle that dissonance over time. But my god, if I just had someone to exchange a glance with when feeling particularly dysphoric, or someone to talk to about how I\'m feeling........ I don‚Äôt know what kind of a trade off that is.\n\nAny advice? I just wish it could be the same for me as it is for him :/', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Want to come out--sort of--help?

This got me thinking because while i only read articles about the procedure it self. I havent read about these exact claims by that other reddit user. If theres anyone who could help that would be greatly appreciated.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Post op trans mtf discussion', 'created': 1587887195.0}"

I've known you for a while and i think it's time i tell you something, i am coming out as transgender.
You have come to know me as a male but for awhile how I've been looking into it and I'd be happier being female.

I know it's a sudden change and that it might take a while getting used to it but to be perfectly honest, im getting used to it to,
I haven't even thought of a new name or if I'll be keeping the one i have, all i know is that im female and i want your respect.

As of now im just entering the ""Social"" stages of transition and have questions so I'm sure you will to, so if you need answers you can either ask me or look them up, I'll try my best to answer all of your questions and help you understand what information you find yourself if needed.

2020-04-27 13:33:57,g90rq6,0,1,"I love this community. I am also bisexual and have been since middle school.  (also i wont be using pronouns for my parent or other people involved in my story) (metions of r\*pe, bullying and homophobia) With that out of the way, i told my older sibling when i was 13 that i might be trans. I started dressing more masculine as time went on and passed so well. My sibling told my parent and i was beat. This wasnt the first time my parent used belts, fists and other things to beat me with. I had bruises a lot, and i have some scars today. I went through r\*pe at a young age. And i rather not get into that, but its just to show that ive had my deal of trauma. I never was really comfortable with my body growing up. I started to really hate it around 5th grade. I found myself avoiding mirrors, and i still catch myself doing it. I wasnt really ""like other girls"" (i know that sounds like wattapad-ish but its true) i wasnt into what the other girls where. I loved pirates, mud, and was fascinated in trucks. I never liked long hair, i just always thought it was something i had to have. I got my hair cut short was 12, before i knew what trans even was. I was happy with it, tho i actually wanted a side shave haircut.. ya know i practically wanted a boy haircut but was told no. When i cut my hair a boy i was friends with said he didnt know girls COULD cut their hair short. I didnt pay much attention to the rest he said because by that time i already had him blanked out. I was in a public middle school for maybe a year, and i was so awfully bullied i was taken out and put into a private christian school. My parents are religious, and also am I. A lot of the kids there where so sheltered. So it wasn't uprisings that he didn't know much. I remember something caught my attention in his talking fit which he had often. He said ""my mother told me this doesn't make you a boy now b-"" and thats all that caught my attention. I thought about it all day until i shrugged it off. A mom tried to get me KICKED OUT of the school because she thought that i was gay. She flipped out and went to the board of the school demanding something happen. She said i was going to corrupt her child. And plenty more of stuff. I was a big fan of shane dawson, unlike other kids who only knew christian rappers and country singers. Lucky me my other parent was a big metal head and rock fan.  So i was raised knowing who these people where. I had nothing to talk about to other kids. Especially girls. Me and girls had nothing in common. And mostly my friends were boys growing up. I had a couple friends that where girls, but they wherent like main friends and i think some of them now are either trans or some type of LGBT. My other parent who is now disabled is homophobic. Not like chanting and screaming. Just the ""its my opinion"" type. I think my main parent denies their homophobia, at least my other one is honest. I have an openly gay cousin, he has a husband and from what ive heard they are great guys. But i wasn't ever allowed to meet them and my uncles swore them out of the family. They refuse to talk to him. When i heard this i wondered what was going to happen to me. I was only 12 but had already been through so much homophobia. Back to when i was 13. Thats when i was obsessed with the trans topic. I watched so many trans youtubers to pass the time. Like i said, i was outed at 13. And after i realized how hard it was to be who i thought was myself i was back to growing my hair out and presenting as a girl. When i got my period at late 12, my body started to change and i hated it. My chest came in at 13. I hated it and would often wear 2 sports bras our big t shirts. A year went by still presenting female and my hair was long, i didnt look at my hair much and when i did have to mess with it id put it up in a man bun or style it masculine. I took a long look in the mirror one day and buzzed it. I feel so much more comfortable with short hair. I feel so much more comfortable with masculine clothes. My other older sibling told me a couple months ago that i always had a masculine energy and i did and thought of things in a manlike way. That i carry myself like a man. That i have the mannerisms of  a man and so on. This reminded me of how i was bullying on the play ground and called a boy. Which never bothered me, like what my sibling said didn't. The weird thing is im used to my body. Everything you read about transgenders it says you want to rip your own skin off or something. And it doesn't feel like that. It just feels like i cant RELATE to my body. I feel almost out of body sometimes. I always liked art and makeup. Which makes me feel..invalid? I kind of suppose im cis beause i dont mind dressing feminine really (even if i more comfortable in masc things) and love the art of makeup. Theres a lot of reasons i rebunk that im trans. And even when i try to say it it just.. i cant. Its also safe to say ive struggled with depression so much. And anxiety. Dysphoria is a whole new ball game, or maybe it ties in. My friends refer to me as he/her and they. I never correct any of them bcz i dont really care. But ive started going by they. I feel like its a safe ground to not really have to say that im either. I know thats so odd.. of course my family doesn't know. Accept for my cousin because she messaged me actually asking if i was trans. She said shes ""always known"" and that i was always man like. This shocked me but i told her i preferred they them. She said ""Okay. Love you cousin no matter what."" And that was really crazy.

Lucky me my other parent was a big metal head and rock fan.  So i was raised knowing who these people where. I had nothing to talk about to other kids. Especially girls. Me and girls had nothing in common. And mostly my friends were boys growing up. I had a couple friends that where girls, but they wherent like main friends and i think some of them now are either trans or some type of LGBT. My other parent who is now disabled is homophobic. Not like chanting and screaming. Just the ""its my opinion"" type. I think my main parent denies their homophobia, at least my other one is honest. I have an openly gay cousin, he has a husband and from what ive heard they are great guys. But i wasn\'t ever allowed to meet them and my uncles swore them out of the family. They refuse to talk to him. When i heard this i wondered what was going to happen to me. I was only 12 but had already been through so much homophobia. Back to when i was 13. Thats when i was obsessed with the trans topic. I watched so many trans youtubers to pass the time. Like i said, i was outed at 13. And after i realized how hard it was to be who i thought was myself i was back to growing my hair out and presenting as a girl. When i got my period at late 12, my body started to change and i hated it. My chest came in at 13. I hated it and would often wear 2 sports bras our big t shirts. A year went by still presenting female and my hair was long, i didnt look at my hair much and when i did have to mess with it id put it up in a man bun or style it masculine. I took a long look in the mirror one day and buzzed it. I feel so much more comfortable with short hair. I feel so much more comfortable with masculine clothes. My other older sibling told me a couple months ago that i always had a masculine energy and i did and thought of things in a manlike way. That i carry myself like a man. That i have the mannerisms of  a man and so on. This reminded me of how i was bullying on the play ground and called a boy. Which never bothered me, like what my sibling said didn\'t. The weird thing is im used to my body. Everything you read about transgenders it says you want to rip your own skin off or something. And it doesn\'t feel like that. It just feels like i cant RELATE to my body. I feel almost out of body sometimes. I always liked art and makeup. Which makes me feel..invalid? I kind of suppose im cis beause i dont mind dressing feminine really (even if i more comfortable in masc things) and love the art of makeup. Theres a lot of reasons i rebunk that im trans. And even when i try to say it it just.. i cant. Its also safe to say ive struggled with depression so much. And anxiety. Dysphoria is a whole new ball game, or maybe it ties in. My friends refer to me as he/her and they. I never correct any of them bcz i dont really care. But ive started going by they. I feel like its a safe ground to not really have to say that im either. I know thats so odd.. of course my family doesn\'t know. Accept for my cousin because she messaged me actually asking if i was trans. She said shes ""always known"" and that i was always man like. This shocked me but i told her i preferred they them. She said ""Okay. Love you cousin no matter what."" And that was really crazy. I get support from friends but i really cant face the fact that i am possibly a trans guy. Is denial normal? What would you guys consider dysphoria? Anything you have to say will help.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Ive been questing if i was trans for years but just cant accept it', 'created': 1588019637.0}"

Hello Reddit,

Currently I'm writing a cyberpunk/fantasy novel where my protagonist is a mtf transwoman. I want my novel to be as realistic and believable as possible but I am not a transperson myself so I can not completely know how said person feels.

The novel is about Shadowrun. For those who don't know this franchise, it's a cyberpunk/fantasy universe where concerns rule the world. Most of the people are poor and many of them become ,,shadowrunners"". People who are doing illegal work (from stealing something to murder someone) to earn some extra money.

The protagonist, Sandra, has to do very hard physical work as a living. She earns just enough to pay the rent of her small apartement and some food. While she's doing this she has to listen to her conservative family who don't accepts her transsexuality.

Someday a friend shows her this network where people do said illegal work. That sounds really attractive to her because she should earn 3 rents for just a few hours of work. Well, that goes pretty wrong and she becomes wanted. This causes her to slowly get more and more criminal until it becomes her new life. 

That said I have the following question. Add some point in the story the protagonist looks at her own body in the mirror. I use many metaphors to describe her feelings and stuff and at this point she compares herself with a cocoon that will never hatch. She is just able to decorate her cocoon to look similar to a real butterfly. (Sounds way better in german)

My question is: Would a transperson in this situation think something like that? Is there anyone who was in this or in a similar situation (without the part about crime lol) that can help me?

And just in case: I am not transphobic. I DON'T think that transwoman aren't real woman like the metaphor says. I just want this novel to be as realistic as possible and want to know if its realistic for the protagonist to think this way in a situation like that.

That said, I hope you all have a nice day &lt;3",trans,Question for writing a novel with a mtf protagonist,1588111874.0,"{'created_utc': 1588086674, 'id': 'g9oyde', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '(Triggerwarning: this post contains the following topics that could trigger some people: Murder)\n\nHello Reddit,\n\nCurrently I\'m writing a cyberpunk/fantasy novel where my protagonist is a mtf transwoman.

For the past 6 years I've been testing the waters and love dressing up behind closed doors and shaving all my body hair. I suck at make up. Im always dodging the mirror because I cant stand my appearance. Ive always had facial hair to cover my jawline because it really bothered me until recently I shaved clean. But all this time has let me really dive into some of the things I enjoy doing that I would never tell anyone. Ive lately been obsessing with snapch4t filters especially the ""twin"" filter. 

Im in a committed relationship thats lasted 12 years so far. My gf has always known about some of the things I was into sexually but not about dressing up and enjoying feeling feminine. Ive recently had a long conversation with her about it and shes only so accepting and it scares the hell out of me. She wants to have kids and be a mom and I am so not in that place right now and it makes me feel like im being selfish. 

Ive had a nasty troubled childhood filled with abuse and neglect and severe anger troubles. My parents divorced at 3 and my mom had multiple partners. I didnt see a lot of my dad because my mom had custody and I had trouble in school for as far back as I can remember. Skipping school, drugs, and petty crimes/vandalism. 

Its weird for me to be here because it hasnt occured to me so strongly before and I have so many questions. There were little things that made me suspicious from my childhood and sexual experiences as a teen but nothing definite. I luckily have a doctors appointment this friday and will bring it up. My appointment is originally to try and get me off antidepressants, that ive been taking for the last 10 years, to see what im struggling with still if anything. Is this what ive been troubled with for so long and not realized it?

I know dudes can like hot showers but they usually make fun of women‚Äôs nearly boiling hot cleansing water so I gotta know from y‚Äôall too.

Non-binary peeps, are you in between? If you feel more masculine or feminine does it change at all? Do you use different temperatures that exceed the temperatures that people who identify with the binary genders know of? (it‚Äôs ok you don‚Äôt have to tell us)

2020-04-30 03:51:46,gaofy3,6,1,"I‚Äôm trans (duh) and had scheduled a minor, gender affirming surgery for May 21st before the virus broke out. It‚Äôs only a tubal ligation, but it means so much to me and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been needing for a long time. I have a lot of dysphoria around my genitalia and the concept of fertility and even knowing my body is capable of being pregnant is.. horrifying to me. It‚Äôs wrong for me, my body isn‚Äôt supposed to be made that way. I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall understand what I mean.

I also have an IUD that is expired by over a year and the longer I keep it the higher the risk for infection. The previous attempt to remove it was unsuccessful and one of the most painful things I‚Äôve ever experienced, hence my doctor and I decided to remove it under anesthesia at the same time as my ligation. 

Clinics and hospitals in my area were recently given the OK to continue with some elective surgery cases. My doctor assures me that my surgery, which will be outpatient, will be held in a wing of the hospital that is separated from COVID patients and my doctor is not treating those patients or even walking through any of the virus wings. They‚Äôre also going to test me for the virus before the surgery. My mother is incredibly supportive of my surgery and has expressed her concern for my future mental health if I don‚Äôt get it. She believes that it‚Äôs safe because of the level of care they‚Äôre taking at the hospital to keep COVID and non-COVID patients separate, but I‚Äôm still trepidatious. 

Obviously I have concerns. I‚Äôm terrified of becoming infected and exposing my family, who will be caring for me after the surgery (bed-ridden for a week at least.) I‚Äôm generally very healthy, but my immune system will be busy trying to heal from the surgery and that could leave me with my defenses down. More and more we‚Äôre seeing young. Healthy people pass from the virus. 

The other side of it is.. I‚Äôm 25, and I‚Äôm off my family‚Äôs insurance when I turn 26 in almost exactly a year. This surgery is $26,000 without insurance. If there was a guarantee that I could get it before my 26th birthday next May, I‚Äôd postpone without a second thought. My doctor‚Äôs office had to postpone between 30-40 surgeries because of the virus, and hundreds more at the hospital. If I decide to postpone mine there‚Äôs absolutely no telling when I could get back in the books, especially considering we don‚Äôt know when this will end in the US and I‚Äôm betting there will be a third wave. 

I‚Äôm asking for advice because I‚Äôm truly at a loss. It doesn‚Äôt help that I have OCD which manifests hypochondriac-symptoms and my anxiety is already through the roof. But I need this surgery for both my mental health and to prevent risks to my physical wellbeing and I‚Äôm running out of time.
