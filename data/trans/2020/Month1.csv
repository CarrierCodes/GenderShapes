For the past forty years, my little brother was a gun loving, big truck driving, fox news loving redneck. Our relationship has been non existent for the past few years because of disagreements over the family farm and a refusal to treat my step children as family.


When he got divorced last winter, I reached out to him.... (I want to do my pronouns properly. If I'm referring to pre-transition do I use the pronoun appropriate to that time or the pronoun in use now?)  Anyway there was silence to my attempt to be there for my sibling.

When I woke up this morning I saw on Facebook that the person who was my brother is now Sofia.

Sofia can do her eyeliner better than me.

According to Facebook, my sister chose this name because it was the name our mom was going to use if she'd had a girl. I never knew that. I've always hated my name (Julie doesn't fit me at all) and I've loved the name Sofia forever. So not fair. Yeah, I know that isn't very important, but I'm going to pout for a sec. 

When we were children, I told mom over and over to take him back to the hospital and bring back a sister. 

Sofia is 6'4"" (almost 2 meters) and wears men's size 13 or 14 shoes.   That can't be easy at all.

When someone comes out as a new gender, do you get her a gift? What would I get her? Jewelry? An eye shadow palette? A scarf?

And to admit it I am a guy but feel like I express my true self online as a woman. I play video games as female characters and I have a childhood that could point towards trans but it's unsure.

There is an issue tho. I’ve been raised to like what I like no matter what stereotypes would say but as I’ve recently tried to be more accepting with the fact I really love colours and started wearing more pastel I’ve been stressing and crying over the fact that I happen to be a lot more feminine from time to time. I very much know that interests mostly have nothing to do with gender and stuff like that but I just like so many things both ways and want to die when I restrain myself to fit in as more masculine. 

When I was little this never bothered me because nobody said or set ant norms or rules for how I should be. I could wear something extremely feminine one day and something considered more masculine the other. 

My family doesn’t care and let me like what I want but everything in my head has been a mess since I hit puberty a few weeks before I turned 8. 

My physical appearance doesn’t match with my age at all and my mental age is even further off than those two from each other. 

The gender identity as far as I can tell doesn’t match up with anything because I don’t act like most cis guys would do.

I want to wear stuff like dresses and skirts from time to time because they’re cute and make me feel happy but at the same time I’m a guy and people just don’t seem to understand that what I’m wearing doesn’t say much about me other than the fact I really enjoy colourful things. 

I do not think I’m gender fluid or bigender but now I’m getting unsure if I’m nonbinary or a guy and I cry all the time now about the smallest things at this point. 

I really just wish now I was on testosterone because then I would be able to most likely just look gay instead of a girl which I would be completely fine with.

My dysphoria is extremely bad because I have giant hips and curves that are impossible to cover up. I’m also very short because of a few issues and my body doesn’t work with me at all. 

I can’t loose weight no matter how much I’ve been trying because of my genes and my mom knows a lot of issues are because of the fact I’m too short so I’m going to get it checked if I can get growth hormones to get taller in awhile.

I live in a very small Swedish town where everyone is supposed to be the same but my family and especially me doesn’t fit in at all and I just wish I could change myself or make the others here stop judging people so much.

I told her how I wanted to start taking estrogen. How I’d felt like this for years. How I wanted to get curves and feel sexy. How id still present as a male at work and in daily life. Tying my chest down and wearing my same male clothes. She of course was supportive telling me that that’s fine and if that makes me happy then go ahead and do it but she said she doesn’t like girls and basically it’s like change into a woman and lose the attraction of my wife but continue to coparent and live together and maybe catch a grimace or two in my peripheral here and there. Or just forget the whole thing and go back to how life was. I don’t want to be that guy who took hormones and affected his family. I don’t wanna be that guy that just said screw how you’re feeling this is how I feel I’m gonna do me at your expense. Is this worth it?

I have know several trans folks in my life, I have stood in solidarity in the fight for equal rights and justice for people of all sorts. I have had close friends and colleagues who were out as trans when I met them. Last August my husband's youngest sibling, who I've known since they were 10 years old, came out as trans, f to m. I have always felt very close to my husband's youngest sibling and I felt they were like a little sister while my own little sister was drug addicted and mentally I'll and very hard to be close to. I am finding that I am having a harder time wrapping my head around my husband's youngest sibling's transition more than I thought I would. I am tripping on the gender specific language a lot. Part of it is that they are not very specific about what they want and that is their choice but I am finding that it is hard for me to talk about my issues with my husband or my therapist without tripping on what to call them. 
I have a 2 year old daughter and she does not understand gender, let alone the idea that someone could change genders and I am having a hard time explaining that Aunt T is now Uncle T and I am also feeling weird about calling them my brother-in-law or my husband's brother when he used to have one brother and one sister. Another part of it might be that I also have one brother and one sister and have never had to think about having to differentiate two siblings with the same gender in the same family. I am mostly using they for pronouns as you may have noticed but until T tells me to use a specific pronoun set I feel like this is where I am at but the gender specific family titles don't have gender neutral versions and I feel like for those who are more androgynous or while they are transitioning I wish there were better words to use. 
So my question to the community is, how can I get my brain more acquainted with thinking about T as a male and using male family words to refer to them? I love them and want them to find happiness and comfort in their body. At this point the only difference is a slightly lower voice but otherwise they look and seem just the same as ever.

Hey guys and gals, so as the title suggests I need help coming out as trans. Throughout my life I have had hints of dysphoria since I was a little kid. Recently I have seriously considered coming out after years of knowing I might be trans. My main concerns are an unaccepting family, bullying, and stories of detransitioners. These all sound scary and I don’t want to regret what should be a benefit to my mental health. I am currently 16 and go to an all boys school so I’m not sure what to do. I also am scared and unsure of how to tell my parents I am trans. My current plan is to start cross dressing once I get a car and a license and then transition once I go to college so I am safe from being kicked out of the home. My mom is pretty Intolerant of trans people despite her more open views surrounding gay marriage and the likes. I am so scared you guys so all advice would help.

2020-01-04 14:23:01,ejx6ot,3,4,"Hello.

When I was 13 or so, my dad had passed away and I remember reading a really long story about a man who woke up one day and was a woman and how it affected her life and how she got trough it. It fascinated me and I started relating to it quite a bit. At the time (2003? I remember there was a TV show on about transgender people, sort of like a live blog/reality show that followed them and their stories. 

I began searching online about things and there was a test on Trangender.org about if you could be. I took it and the results came back that I was most likely a woman inside. 

I did what research I could and then came out to my mom, but it sort of just...didn’t go anywhere.

I lived my life as a man still and pressed forward, but the thoughts have always been in the back of my head, constantly a feeling Od come back to, but ignored.

I e had major depression, general anxiety, and PTSD, all diagnosed, for years. Finally I got on a treatment that seems to be working well, and the feelings of being misgendered are even stronger than ever

I’m 32 this year and since 2016 I have been in a relationship with the most wonderful woman I have ever known. I love her so much, we were planning on getting engaged any day now. I told her how I am feeling around Christmas about being trans, and she asked how likely the feelings are actually real. I said I don’t know, 50/50. That I’d need a doctor to tell me I’m right or wrong.

I kept doing research and the other day she saw a message on my phone about my regrets of not transitioning sooner in life and things exploded. She now says she 100% doesn’t want to be with a woman and that we can’t have a relationship if I transition.

I’m so lost and hurt, I thought we were stronger than that. I feel like she only cares about the physical part of me, and that all the rest of me is just a side thought. She won’t even try to be with me and to me, I feel like that’s just giving up. How can she even know how she’s feel unless we try? 

Now I can’t decide if I want to do anything about my feelings anymore or if I should just forget about them like I have already done for so long.

I don’t even know if what I’m feeling is real or just a side effect of years of mental disorder and a desire to finally feel better. I definitely don’t trust my own judgement.

I know that I strongly feel my body is wrong. That I want to be feminine, have curves, be cute/pretty, and most importantly, be chemically balanced finally so I can feel right for once.  I’m attracted to women, and i don’t want surgeries, I like my penis, I just dislike everything else. 

Maybe I’m just latching on to a fetish idea. Maybe my other chemical imbalances can be corrected without hormones. Maybe I’m just being rash. I’m so confused and scared.

Anyone have any help or advice here?",trans,"Soon to be fiancé found out about me wrestling with being trans, everything is exploding now.

So, to compensate for this, I’ve decided to write a letter to my parents telling why I should be able to go on testosterone and the benefits it would have for me.\n\nI need advice from people who’s parents have refused them testosterone and how you convinced them to let you take it, or if they didn’t let you, what you did and how you managed to get by. Cuz i dunno how much more I can take of this. Thanks guys!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Convincing my parents to let me take testosterone', 'created': 1578230465.0}"

 I actually endured the arguing and the angry debate for a while, but at some point I just started crying. trying to justify to someone your dysphoria when even you try to convince yourself you're not trans eventually gets the worst of your insecurities out.
 
After the crying got in the way of my debate with the friend and I just was way too emotional, my other friend went in the conversation and tried to make him start being more specific on why he was attacking me he finally calmed off and I got to breathe.
I still don't know what the back he wanted me to do or say for him to be happy :/

I told my brother, who is gay and married (having gone fully through the trials of lgbt), that I am trans. It felt good to talk about it. 

I’m left with encouragement, but also tons of confusion and fear. Maybe I don’t feel female at heart but instead it’s just a longing for something different. Maybe I’m just faking it, deep down. Maybe it’s just a phase? And many more things that are just globbed up feelings I can’t put words to.

2020-01-07 04:41:16,el6flc,0,1,"Hey y’all,

Been on hrt for a couple of months and had an update at my endo.  Been on oral E 2mg and spiro 100mg/day and I been wanting to switch to injections (heard good things vs oral) and get off spiro, do an E only regimen I been reading about, and maybe ask to add progesterone after my next Dr appointment.  

My Estradiol sensitive was 52 from 32 pre hrt and T was 81 from 430.  Was surprised my T got so low on a low dose hrt so fast.

Now I am only taking EC IM (depo estradiol) 5mg every 2 weeks.  Hoping by April will be getting closer or over 100 for E (want just under 200) and still under 100T.  Heard gradual increases are best for breast growth and safety.

I had modest breast growth 2 months in, everyone notices omg, I seem to be gaining weight even with being on a sort of diet and excerise ... Maybe coming off spiro will help with weight loss and help stop my developing ED.

2020-01-07 15:35:14,eld1zq,1,1,"to start out Im a trans guy and my gf is trans as well. I have severe anxiety, and a topic that makes me feel really awful is names. I can be 1000% sure of someone's name, but my brain will still condemn me for even thinking of saying it.

&amp;#x200B;

When me an my gf were just friends, I suppose she hasld 2 name changes. one from her deadname to a new one, and then she chose a new new name bc the other one people always abbreviated and it made her feel bad

&amp;#x200B;

name number 3 is the one she's had the entire time we've dated (1 year 4 months) and Im fond of the name and very sentimental of it. her name and mine start with the same initial and she made a very cute monogram design of it, that I got a custom necklace of \[another concern is that she is definitely no longer going to like this necklace, and since gift giving is my love language, Im taking it was more personally than I probably should\] 

&amp;#x200B;

ultimately, I would definitely support this name change, and I would never try to pressure her into not changing it again. I just know its going to make me have some emotional problems, and I'm trying to figure out how to convey it wothout being an asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

when she moved from name 2 to name 3 before, I was unable to call her by that name for a while due to my name anxiety. the name anxiety got so bad, that my brain even began suggesting her deadname even tho I never even called her by it when I knew her! (I called her by her last name, I didnt know she was trans at the time but I was like ""your name is /deadname/?? Im sorry that name is way too lame for you. Im gonna call you Lastname bc its fun if thats okay"" obvs my anxiety was way less bad then lol, that was back in 2015) 

&amp;#x200B;

Im worried about going through the same struggle again, but Worse bc she is my gf now, and that name fills my heart with love. other names she's thinking about spund so foreign to me. I know once I start associating them with her I will love that name too, but I know its going to come with emotional struggles. and Im already going through enough that I think its going to be stupidly hard on me.

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like a jerk bc I want to be supportive, but Im afraid that the emotions Im feeling will get in the way. I know I need to tell her someway somehow so that she knows where it's coming from, but Im afraid of echoing like, you know annoying parents and such?

&amp;#x200B;

it wasnt like this last time, even tho her old name I did think a lot. i didnt like her old name tho, and was kinda relieved when she changed it? it gave me anxiety that I would call her the wrong name (and it is a 1 syllable 4 letter name??) but it didnt make me feel this much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know where all the feelings are coming from really. I think a lot of it is just like...is she not going to want to look at stuff I wrote that name on? 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not really afraid of her changing, or the changes she's already had. I can grow wirh that. thata not scary but a silly little name change? bc it might mean she wont like my gifts anymore? 

&amp;#x200B;

like, I know how she is, she runs away from her past big time, she likes being in the present and not being reminded

&amp;#x200B;

I dont even care about any money I effort I put into things. its literally just the idea that it was a display of love amd if she doesmt like it anymore than idk

&amp;#x200B;

there was like 1 time that I got the vibe she didnt so much like a gift from me and it was so bad I ended up having emotional flashbacks like a week straight over it. so Im kinda thinking this is triggering a similar thing but I dont know why

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know why I just know it hurts way more than it should. 

&amp;#x200B;

she mentioned it the first time several weeks ago, and it hurt just as much. I thought I processed it, but I guess I didnt, bc she mentioned it again and Im right back here 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: me and gf are both trans. my gf is thinking of changing her name again, and I havent told her yet but its affecting me to a disproportionate degree. I think it may be triggering an emotional flashback of sorts but am unsure. Im worried she wont like old cards or gifts involving her name and giftgiving is my primary love language.

2020-01-07 23:26:20,eljqwl,2,1,"Okay so a lot to unpack but: I’m FtM, 19, been out to a select few for 3ish years, 5 years since I figured it out and 6 since I started unconsciously playing around with gender roles.  
My traumas include: abuse physical and mental, sexual assault, abandonment, and house fire. (Idk if that’s all needed but giving everything I feel would help get an understanding of what’s going on) 

I have been given permission to start T by a doctor and am on my 3rd month. I have also been going to constant monthly therapy sessions with the same therapist for 3 years. And have seen a few other councillors over this time. And they have all shown support. However my mom, (my only parent,) doesn’t believe I am actually Trans due to trauma. 

Both my doctor and therapist are highly supportive and told me that if everyone with trauma turned gay or trans the world wouldn’t be straight. And that the trauma was a way to bring attention to issues, but because it’s been so long of me being comfortable identifying trans and the constant state of my gender expression that they solidly believe that I am. 

But my mom doesn’t agree. She at first took my therapist as just an agenda pusher, and said I had to do things the long way. And I did. I brought her along to assessment meetings and invited her to go to our closest Lgtb center for a trans info and question night for parents. (It’s one hour away) she hasn’t made any sign of wanting to go. 

But now that I’ve been accepted and started hormone treatment she’s been making me heart broken with “I don’t agree with it. I don’t like it. You aren’t a man” and I can understand that’s she just wants whats best for me and is straight up linking trauma to me being trans but it’s getting frustrating to the point where my mental health was improving but now has reached a low that I haven’t felt in years. It’s gotten to the point that every now and then I question if I really am (but it goes away). I’m anxious and hurt.

Hello everybody! I do hope you're all doing well. I have a small situation I was hoping some of you might be able to help me with. You see, I've (16 year old male) recently started a relationship with such an amazingly lovely boy (16 year old FtM). I am so incredibly in love with him, and I want him to have all the good things in the world. However, there arises our ""situation"". We like to spend long periods of time together when we can (vacations and off days are used to their fullest watching filmographic media in each others' arms while eating pizza). And as he admitted to me recently, he spends all that time in his binder. Now, I am of course no expert in these matters, but I'm quite knowledgeable about the fact that long periods of binding without breaks is not healthy. Understandably he doesn't wish to discard the binder when we are together, so I was hoping you peeps could maybe suggest alternatives, or if you've had similar situations how did ya handle it? Now, I want him to be comfortable. Physically comfortable. He insists he loves spending that time with me, but I don't want him to cause himself damage just because he wants to spend time with me. Don't get me wrong, I want to be with him more than anything else. But I want him to enjoy it to the fullest. I would like to find him a more comfortable solution he can wear when we are spending long times together or when he wishes to wear a binder but also be comfy. Now, he insists on getting a binder that binds semi-well (adjusts properly and such), which I understand is quite a challenge to make comfortable. So unless someone can come up with a really convincing argument for things like sports bras they're out of the picture. He insists there are no such binders or alternatives that I'm suggesting that exist, but I'll do anything for him to feel happy. Also a footnote: Price does not matter. If there is a way to get a specially designed binder or something extremely premium, please let me know. I love him so much, and if it helps him it'll be more than worth it. He is the most important person in my life, and the times I spend with him are the best of my life. So I want him to be comfortable in those times, and also secure when he's with me. Any and all advice, tips and tricks and stories are extremely helpful. Thanks in advance!

Now, I want him to be comfortable. Physically comfortable. He insists he loves spending that time with me, but I don\'t want him to cause himself damage just because he wants to spend time with me. Don\'t get me wrong, I want to be with him more than anything else. But I want him to enjoy it to the fullest. I would like to find him a more comfortable solution he can wear when we are spending long times together or when he wishes to wear a binder but also be comfy. Now, he insists on getting a binder that binds semi-well (adjusts properly and such), which I understand is quite a challenge to make comfortable. So unless someone can come up with a really convincing argument for things like sports bras they\'re out of the picture. He insists there are no such binders or alternatives that I\'m suggesting that exist, but I\'ll do anything for him to feel happy. Also a footnote: Price does not matter. If there is a way to get a specially designed binder or something extremely premium, please let me know. I love him so much, and if it helps him it\'ll be more than worth it. He is the most important person in my life, and the times I spend with him are the best of my life. So I want him to be comfortable in those times, and also secure when he\'s with me. Any and all advice, tips and tricks and stories are extremely helpful.

I’ve been fantasizing about being a girl for almost 2 years now, and going back to some childhood memories, there were some really clear signs that I wanted to be a girl, but I pushed those thoughts away as they were happening.

So, I would really like to start HRT, but I’m pretty sure my dad wouldn’t support me, and I would probably have to wait until I turn 18 to start HRT. So, in the meantime, I want to figure out if I really want a female body more that my actual body, since I’m bisexual I would like to experiment sexually with both sexes and see how I feel, and other stuff, but the point here is:

If I started HRT tomorrow, would the changes be to different compared to if I started in 1.5 years from now?
Like, I’d like to know if I’d be able to pass more if I started tomorrow. Or if the changes would be significantly different.

I’m kinda scared that I won’t be able to pass since I’m already 5’9, my face is kinda feminine though (very similar to my mom’s when she was my age, so that is kinda comforting), and my voice isn’t really low pitched.

you are the holy broken.

the one holding the light. 

and if you show your scars, people will come

by living gently,

unafraid of opinion. 
ready to wipe away

However, this is completely new territory for me a cis, straight guy who was raised in a conservative religion (I'm now an atheist). I want to be the best dad I can possibly be to my kid but don't know how...

First of all, I read the PFLAG book and it mentions that kids should be in gender counseling as soon as possible. Why is this? Is this so that a therapist can help them work through their feelings? Should I try to be in on the conversations or have separate talks with the therapists?

Also, I am REALLY NERVOUS about medical interventions while he is so young. I have read reports about risks (particularly bone density) from puberty inhibitors and the last thing I want to do is harm his physical health. However if he is very dismorphic I would like to get him the appropriate help he needs. Is there a good place where I can learn in depth about this stuff?

From another perspective, I'm nervous about him taking medicine because I don't know if his gender identity is set. Please don't mistake me, I'm not saying this is a phase! I am saying that there are more options than just cis and FTM trans, and would like to give him time and opportunity to explore his own identity without feeling locked into a particular option. What is the consensus as to when gender identity becomes solid or mature in a person. Is it after puberty?

Here's the big one. The reason why I don't know his pronouns and we haven't talked about it much is because his mom, my wife, is still a conservative Christian. She is not homo/transphobic and she likes my LGBT friends but I think she's going to freak out. Also, my large extended family will completely disown us and this may be quite traumatic for him never to see his grandma, uncles and aunts, and cousins again. Does anyone here have a similar experience of coming out in a deeply religious family? Were you able to maintain any connection with the family afterwards?

Lastly, are there any suggestions on how I can be supportive of him/her/zer/xer/them? So far after telling me, he doesn't want to talk further and I've been giving him space, but I don't want him to suffer a lot without getting therapy if that's what he needs. Since he is REALLY young, how do I strike a balance between letting him explore his own identity and keeping him safe from stupid shit that ALL kids do? This is really difficult, but I'm up the task.

2020-01-10 12:48:26,emqhp8,1,1,"I've been questioning my gender and I don’t know how to feel about it...

First things first, sorry for the “broken English”, it’s not my first language and I’m writing this at 6:30 AM (lol)

I’m also sorry if the post is too long, I really needed to write this.

Well, for quite some time now I've been questioning my gender (sort of, idk, I don’t like thinking about it ;( )

When I was 15/16 I had pretty transphobic ish views and stuff, but as I grew older I became more socially liberal, ever since I fully accepted the LGBTQ+ community I became very aware that I had a fixation about one term in particular “transgender”, I don’t know, it just, seemed to matter to me more than the other people in that community, I became more interested in that part of the community than any other, at first I thought it was because Gay/Queer people seemed way more accepted and I thought that the trans community was particularly more vulnerable (which is true) and that’s why I was more interested in that, but now I don’t know how to feel about it.

So about a year or so ago I encountered the r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns subreddit and I initially subscribed to it because I’m a pretty lefty guy and the memes were good, (not that I felt identified by the memes in any way, I just found them funny) and for a lot of time it was fine, I checked reddit, saw some memes and then continued with my life.

But later on something started itching my nerve, a very close friend asked my “why I spent so much of my time invested in trans issues?” at first I just did the typical reply “well, obviously because the trans community is more marginalized and because gay people are more accepted, because trans rights are important and so on (you get the idea)” but then that question started to eat my alive, was THAT really the reason I was so invested in so many parts of the trans community?, or maybe, it was something else?

I started questioning myself, am I really the gender I thought I was?, do I feel comfortable being a guy?, Up to that point I had never done that, and I felt pretty weird, I was never particularly masculine growing up, I mean, I was a regular kid, I did sports, had friends, etc. But in a way, I never had the same experience as other kids my age.

You know when you are like 12 or 13 and boys start caring about height, and how deep your voice is, or how other people see you, etc, well, I never really felt that, I was quite short for my age, but I never really cared, and my voice (while masculine) wasn’t deep at all, and I, didn’t care either.

At this point in my retrospection I was pretty scared ngl, I CANT be trans, right, I mean, my parents, my family, they will literally disown me!!!, I’m probably just scaring myself and being paranoic, right???, then I started to think about aging, do I really want to age as a guy??, do I really want to spend my life in this body?, what if I’m trans and I act To late and I can’t pass as cis?, what if people see me as a freak?

I just repressed those questions for a while, but know I’m kind of balding (I’m already taking medication but fml regardless lol) (I’m in really early stages so not that problematic I might add), and these questions started to resurface again, to the point where I can’t sleep, they keep me awake all night.

The other day I started thinking, if I had a button that could transform me into the other gender, would u press it?, I think I would, is that really a thing I should be worried about?, I’ve been having these kinds of thoughts for a few weeks now, and I don’t know how to feel about it, also I've kind of wanted to present more femme now, I want earrings, longer hair, longer nails, a smoother face, boobs maybe?, maybe wear a chocker?

I was raised 'as a boy' in the 90s to parents who didn't really care about gender norms. I asked for Barbie's when I was a kid. I played house and wanted to marry when I grew up instead of what job I wanted. I liked women's clothes more but I also really envied those girls who were small but wore big men's clothes. I did that and I was just seen as a man. I'm sexually attracted to women and as an adult I realized my femme sexuality (I am pan, but I do prefer femmes), so as a kid: I was just to all appearances just a boy. I liked some girly things like jewelry, pop songs, and dancing; but also lots of boyish things like video games, dungeons and dragons, and making things with metal, swords, and all that geeky stuff. I was a pudgy kid after I got my ps2 and I attributed any body discomfort and lack of love for my exterior to me being fat. And since it was the 90s and I grew up sheltered and religious, transpeople were seen as....wrong. they were villians, crazy people, the butts of jokes. There weren't any serious trans people out there that I was exposed to and so obviously I wasn't 'crazy', I didn't wanna 'cut off my weiner'. So I was seen as male, felt male, and nothing was an issue. 

Fast forward and I eventually meet a girl, we fell in love, we got married, moved around and eventually found out how we as a couple would be. We lost all the weight together and 'got hot for each other'. I loved being loved by her. So much that I didn't realize that even without the weight and factually attractive to someone, I still hated how I looked in the mirror. It was until the marriage was starting to fall apart as I pulled on the thread of the tapestry I wove to conceal who I really was to be what she and I wanted me to be, that she finally said something that truly made me re-evaluate my understanding of self: ""well you're not the most masculine man in the world""


That sentence will burn in my mind forever.


I started searching on my phone in incognito mode, so she wouldn't see me (even though she both never would invade my privacy and knew about incognito..), for 'how to know if your trans?' 'how to know if you're queer?' 'can I be trans and not want all the surgery?' 'can I be trans and not be a femme stereotype?' 'do I have to change my voice?' 'does estrogen change your voice?' 'how do transwomen sound like girls?' 'what to do if you're married as a straight man to a straight woman and find out you're trans?' 'what if I don't transition?' 'trans mortality' 'is it better to hide than come out as trans?' 'can transwomen get uteruses?'

'trans support groups near me' 'poly support groups near me' 'support groups near me' 'CAN ANYONE HELP ME I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING'

2020-01-10 18:33:27,emv34z,4,1,"NOTE: Cross-post on r/MtF 

Hi!  My name's Jasmine, and I'm a trans girl. Still a minor (In the UK) and  still closeted, pre-transition, pre-everything. I just wanted to vent about my life, and how drawing helps me (Plus some of the compromises I do.). So, I like to draw. I LOVE to draw. Art is a wonderful world where  I can be, well, Jasmine. So, whenever I feel down, I just draw my  feelings down. It really helps me get my thoughts off my (Unfortunately  flat) chest. I like to show my drawings to my friends who I've come out  to. I think that, when I come out to my parents, I'll give them one of  my drawings.

So, I don't have any fem clothes, or anything of the sort, so I have to compromise. Here's just some of the things I do:

* I pull the bottom of my school jumper over my legs like a skirt (I just say it's a tic of mine, me being autistic as well)
* When doing ballet, I use the bottom of my blazer as a tutu (I don't know why, it just feels right.)
* At  night, I take my t-shirt off, I wrap my blanket around me (Like a  strapless dress), and fold up my t-shirt and put it on my chest to  simulate, well, a more feminine chest, let's just say.

Also,  as mentioned in my second bullet point, I'm a ballerina. I do it just  for myself, nothing professional, for the sake of doing it. It makes me  feel feminine inside. Of course, still being closeted and that, I mostly  do my ballet at school, dancing along the corridors (So long as no  one's in the way or watching.), curtseying to my friends as a greeting  (Just me? Probably.), and all that stuff.

Thanks for reading.

I've been with him since we were teenagers, were both in our 30s now. I've always known he was trans (I've asked about pronouns, for now he says stick with he/him). He has always enjoyed wearing feminine clothing, and recently he's got really into buying dresses and has found a community on Instagram which is super rad.

He wants to wear his cute stuff out and about, and I've been supporting this. He's usually just worn his stuff to local stuff, friends' events and so on. He wants to go out in public and just enjoy wearing his cute dresses.

I totally support this and I see that it makes him happy, but deep down I worry. I've done some soul searching and I think it's because I'm scared he'll get blowback from strangers. I strongly believe everyone should be able to express themselves however they want, but I think I worry because I care about him?

I haven't said anything to him about this. I'll never stop him from expressing himself however he wants. I'm just wondering how I get past this? I really stress out over it, when really I know most people will just mind their own business. Is there a better way I can support him?

Hey all! I had double incision with nipple grafts and liposuction on June 6th, 2019, from Dr. Brian C. Reuben in Salt Lake City, Utah. He is a very nice and well mannered surgeon, and his team is great. I never had any issues with anyone misgendering me at all throughout the entire process, which was a huge relief for me after hearing others stories about that kind of stuff. Currently I have sensation throughout most of my chest, excluding my nipples and the scars. I paid entirely out of pocket because I was 17 at the time of my procedure and my parents' insurance wouldn't cover anyone over 18. But I was fortunate enough to have the money on hand, so it was a breeze. I go back and forth on the appearance of my scars and nipples. Some days I'm in love with how my scars contour my chest, other days they bother me and make me wish I had waited a little longer to see Dr. Garramone, as his results are probably my favorite out of all surgeon portfolios I have seen. But I wouldn't say I fully regret getting this surgery when I did, as I am in love with having a flat chest. Right now I am eagerly waiting for the bright pink color of my scars to fade to flesh tone. I don't believe this is the fault of my surgeon or anyone else, but my body decided that I would scar very aggressively, so my scars are very thick and raised. I'll meet with Dr. Reuben again in a few months to discuss a scar revision surgery, but I'm very on the fence about it (I might just get tattoos over them). Aside from that, my healing has gone very smoothly. I'm mostly okay with my nipples, but neither of them protrude all that much, and they look a bit like tiny pepperonis. I think once I start working out more and making my chest more firm I will be happier with my scars, since they do follow my pecs decently well. I still have scars from my drains, which I'm a little self conscious about since I haven't noticed anyone else with lasting marks from them. I'm hoping they'll eventually go away. I wanted to share pre op pics, but I unfortunately lost my phone recently, so I no longer have them. I was around a B or C cup size, I think.

they once brought me out to the rest of my family to see me. this is where it first got dicey. 

&amp;#x200B;

all of my family laughed at me. i cried. i was hurt. i was alone. i felt betrayed by my sisters for dressing me up, and i felt betrayed by my family for laughing at me. it was at this point where i learned that me posing as a woman was wrong. 

years later, my brother and i were really big fans of sonic the hedgehog and we would read the sonic archie comics together. This stemmed my passion for art, but also stemmed my appreciation for tomboyish females because of the character 'julie-sue'. she was a badass in my eyes and she was a girl who appeared rough like a guy. i felt like i identified with her.

my brother and i would role play sonic characters when we were younger. something i cringe heavily at to be completely honest. besides that, i would always role as julie-su because she was my favourite. 

so many years later i go on and play skyrim and obviously play as the girl characters, one after another (tho a lot of argonians of course). My username ""spfetcher"" stemms from the name i would use for my characters. ""fetcher"". i used this name for its androgynous sound. 

there are other accounts, but i will move on to when i was in highschool and met my trans friend elliot.

elliots dead name was ""emma"" and he was a super good friend and artist that i looked up to. i had a crush on her but i also wanted to be her. same with another girl i liked later on. when elliot confided in me he was trans for the first time i was also impressed and i felt such sympathy to a degree i didnt understand. 

so eventually of course i see ru pauls drag race and im interested but i was turned off by all the shame i had in my heart over being myself and the idea of being a girl. the stem of these insecurities are all from shitty people in my life but i wont get into that. 

and now i sit here just meditating on my life when all of the sudden these memories and feelings resurge inside of me and i feel like i can accept them all of the sudden and i dont know why. i feel like i want to be a girl. i used to cut my body because i hated it but i assumed it was just because i thought i was ugly. i wanted to look like a girl and be a girl but i was convinced that it was wrong. and now i realize this and im scared.

2020-01-11 13:47:47,en7lc5,2,1,"I had a dream recently where I was a girl. I have them sometimes and they always make me so happy. But it is crushing when I wake up and remember I am a man. This latest dream kind of opened the floodgates and makes me scared I have been in denial. My internal vision of myself is a female alter ego I made up. I hate imaging myself. When I fantasise about the future or the past or about doing cool things I always picture a girl self. When I see my male face in the mirror I feel disappointed.

When I was a kid my mum told me we are reincarnated many times, and we are here to learn a specific lesson. She said trans people failed that lesson and have to come back next time to do it again. So I always felt I could never be trans because I would come back as a man next life. But I remember telling my best friend, at 12 years old, that I could only keep living by dreaming about my next life when I would come back as a girl.

Recently I feel like I don't really want to keep living this life. I kind of want to just kill myself and come back as the girl I want to be.

2020-01-12 11:32:17,enmg6r,0,1,"(Sorry for any bad formatting, mobile. Also, sorry for this tired rant)
I recently worked up the courage to have a discussion with my girlfriend about our future, more specifically relating to my gender. I am 17, turning 18 soon and am about to graduate high school. She was talking about our relationship long term, and as optimistic as I am, the fact that I'm probably trans kept gnawing away at me.
As a resurgence of these feelings came about halfway through our relationship, I never told her about any of this when I was working through it. The me going into this relationship never would have thought that the feelings of 13 year-old me which I put to bed would come back to throw a wrench in everything.  

Today was a good day for us. We spent a lot of time together, and started having deep and open discussion. An opportunity presented itself for me to finally let her know whats going on in my brain. I knew that this needed to be done prior to graduation, the me going to college needs to either know that my girlfriend is entirely supportive or that I have the freedom to be who I am in my new world.

As for her reaction, she was up front in saying that she knew she would not be comfortable marrying a transwoman, but she wants me to be whoever I am meant to be. Knowing her, and knowing me, we both don't want to pursue something that wont end up being a future, so slashing the end probably means slashing everything before it too. Even though I know this is most likely the curtain call to our year-long picturesque journey, I can't help from being relieved she is telling me this now.
However, nothing is official yet. This is a 3 a.m. vent because I tend to bottle things up and my nervous energy is keeping me awake. I just had this conversation and I'm not looking forward to wake up tomorrow.

I love you all ❤️

Every single person close to me or involved in my daily life now knows. It was scary, but the amount of support I got was overwhelming. People can surprise you! My life partners family for example comes from a country very traditional, and when she told her parents they were nothing but supportive. Telling me they loved me and want me to be happy, and still consider me family and want me to come visit them in their country.  


I got an entire new wardrobe.  Before this week, I didn't own any women's clothing at all, only dressing on a rare occasion I could hide it as something special (like for a drag show, or DJing a techno party, or Halloween)

I wore my clothes out in public. Of course, I was incredibly nervous, but no one treated me poorly at all! All of the stores were happy to help. I'd get mis-gendered, but that's understandable as I didn't have makeup on and haven't started HRT. Still, all the staff at the stores were quick to offer help unasked, and cheerful to point me to things.  Also, I think I cared more about myself than those walking by me did. I felt like I was watching people like a hawk and honestly, no one really gave me a second look.   


I scheduled my HRT appointment with planned parenthood for the 16th. I was super nervous about it, but they were incredible. I called, they asked me what name I wanted to go by, what pronoun I wanted, and made things super easy. It was awesome!  


I walked into a hair salon and scheduled an appointment with a stylist. It was nerve wracking, but again, the support the stylist and the owner gave me were incredible. So warm and welcoming and accepting. Very excited for what I was going through and wanting to be part of it!  


Sure, there have been some downsides (and some major ones at that), but overall, the experience (living in Upstate New York for those curious) has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive.

2020-01-14 06:07:37,eohbxd,2,1,"This is a request for resources. I can't navigate this on my own and I don't have anyone I feel comfortable asking. I don't trust therapists, nor family, there are professional penalties to even asking questions, and I worry that I'll lose the friends I have if I become someone different to them.  


My whole life, I've identified as male. I present male, so much so I could be out of central casting. My parts are male. I also was told from an early age that, \_""If you are ever 'gay', I just don't want to know about it.""\_, the implication being I would be disowned. I think my father knew the privilege I was born into -- looking as I did -- and didn't want to ever rock that.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't identify as female. I'm not 100% transgender. But I'm certainly not 100% male, at least not in any way that I understand ""being male"" looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm somewhere in-between. Not 100% male, not 50% male/50% female, and not 0% male/100% female.  


I'd say what ""feels right"" is 80% male/20% female...maybe 70%/30%...I don't know the distribution other than it has never, ever been 100%. I'd imagine being a girl since I was \~4y.  


So my question is this:  


Is it valid if I fly the trans flag even if I am not 100% trans? I look like an ally. I present like an ally. But inside I'm not out, and the moniker of non-binary doesn't fit either.   


To me, the pride flag and the trans flag have always meant ""The world is more complex that you might otherwise believe, and my flying this flag acknowledges and accepts the complexity this flag represents.""  


I  hate all the fucking labels. Sometimes it feels like to be trans is applying a binary choice yet again to what is a non-binary world.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not meaning to offend anyone here. But I've lurked for a long, long time and frequently see insightful commentary. My hope is someone can share/say something that will help it all make sense to someone who isn't 100% trans.

&amp;#x200B;

A common response to this is questioning whether it's any of the other person's business if it has no bearing on the present. Several trans people also still struggle with rejection, prejudice or even bullying when faced with this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps you were rejected by a past date you liked after you identified yourself as trans. Or worse, he/she may have told others about you without your permission such as on social media. It's a risk, absolutely. But is dating not always a risk?

&amp;#x200B;

It may have no bearing on YOUR present, but does a human being not have a right to know the truth before he/she commits to a life with you that may very well become intimate? Both parties are affected by your choice.

&amp;#x200B;

I agree that everyone's past is their own business, but does entering a relationship (even a one-time blind date) not imply that you are, however briefly, sharing your past, present and potential future with another individual?

Nobody typically feels expected to literally tell someone their whole life story down to their deepest secrets on a first date. That's an unrealistic standard. But are certain details not important to be open about, to begin establishing trust?

&amp;#x200B;

As said, there are historically dangers to identifying oneself: Rejection, emotional trauma, even threats of violence. Fear of that is perfectly rational. But does that still justify hiding it from this current date who's had nothing to do with that?

&amp;#x200B;

How would you feel in his/her position? Let's expand it to question the aspect of identity. What does it say about you if you allow societal prejudice or past experiences to influence you into feeling that you must hide who you are?

2020-01-14 20:04:06,eoqkac,2,1,"TL:DR: im standing on a knife edge, paralyzed by fear about what I should do for the vetterment of my family with a little background reasoning as to why.


Ive known im trans for a good 7ish years, my wife and I nearly didnt get married because of it. I had gotten it in my head that i could control it and for the most part i could.

My dysphoria would come and go with varying intensities and it hit behind the walls i created in my mind. I would ease the worst of it with my panties and the occasional skirt and everything was manageable and my wife knew about it all so i wasnt hiding anything.

This went on until about 2 months ago, adding a pair of beautiful children into our family and building a house together over the 7 prior years. 

We were at a party and i was inconsiderate to my wife and she pulled me up on it later, i wanted to improve myself for her because of love and because i wanted to be a better person for her.

I started pulling down the many walls i had built inside me and started reflecting on my coping mechanisms for life, built up from years of abuse and neglect as a child. Thats when things started to get intense. 

Piece by piece i started to better myself until we decided to take the kids to see frozen 2 at the movies. We all dressed up for it seeing that it would be a fun family outting... i dressed as Elsa... for the first time ever, i felt comfortable... kinda like being home.

To me, those few hours wearing a costume dress in public had both opened the flood gates on my dysphoria and made me feel comfortable and ""whole""? in a way i didnt realize i wasnt.

This made me tentatively break down the wall holding back my inner self... i allowed it to wash over me and to actually listen to my inner self.

32 years a man with a woman inside wanting to come out...

Riddled with anxiety and trepidation, i told my wife that I thought of myself as a woman inside and that I wanted to take it slow, find counseling for myself to figure out what i actually needed to do... she was devastated.

That was 4 days ago, she had barely spoken to me since. last night  i got the discussion started... 4 hours later and i have a better idea on where I/we stand.

If i transition it means divorce, if i dont transition it may mean years before she trusts me again... if she can trust me again at all, and there is no guarantee that there wont be issues in the future.

She is both worried about the public perception and that she is not a lesbian, and while sex is not the basis of our relationship it is important for our intimacy. By her own words she cannot support me as a partner while she can support me as a friend.

Its abundantly clear that we love each other very much but love isnt enough to keep us together this time. If only i didnt love her this would be easy. 

The more i think about it the more i feel like im being selfish and hurting her by not walking away and giving her a chance to have a happy life but how do you choose between two things that are diametrically opposed when they both are equally important to you.

Even as i write this i know what i have to do but i am devastated and affraid i wont have the strength to let her go... or is it the strength to persue my true self... i really dont know at this point...

2020-01-15 00:12:54,eou60l,11,1,"Hi everyone! I’ve never posted to reddit before made an account because I feel as though I need to get in touch with others who’ve been in the same position as me. 

So here’s the situation: I’m a 21 year old male from the UK, I have a long term girlfriend and consider myself straight. I am on a placement year at one of the big 4 accounting firms with a job offer waiting for me when I come back at the end of university which I am due to finish next year. 

Despite all of this, I’m in a total meltdown. I can’t stop questioning my gender. It’s completely ruining my ability to do basic pieces of work, get to sleep and function as a proper human being.

I have been questioning my gender for a long time, the majority of my primary school friends were female and I have always hated sports like football and rugby but loved badminton. When I was little I used to dress up all the time in superhero outfits, I asked one Christmas for a cat woman costume and cried when I opened it and it was batman. I used to hate going to football training and stuff and never went to play, I remember my dad used to go with my uncle to watch my cousin play and I would dream on nights that I had turned up gone into the changing rooms and come out a girl who was really good at football and my dad being really happy. 

Things stayed like this until around the age of 8/9. Avatar came out and I remember loving it, a totally imaginative world. I’d never seen anything like it, I imagined myself doing the transfer body thing to be a real girl in my dreams from then on until I hit puberty. 

I hit puberty and began to become really interested in girls. I used to search pretty girl etc into google images on a night and just stare at them for hours on end wishing I was one of them. I started google boy to girl in the hope it was possible and stumbled upon an article about Kim petras. Nothing has ever changed my life like this. I was immediately fascinated, it was everything I had wished for every Christmas and it was possible, the only problem was, I was absolutely terrified of telling anyone how I felt. I used to play a large amount of world of Warcraft and runescape with my guy friends from school and my sister, Id nearly always make female characters and tell them because it was due to the hit boxes being smaller and other assorted bullshit to evade them questioning me. This continued for some years.

Eventually I stumbled upon actual porn. Trans porn from reading a Wikipedia article about kimber James linked from google images. I used to masturbate to trans porn all the time and still do, my fetishes have never got any greater than just plain trans girl on guy porn. Sometimes I watch ultra feminine girls and sometimes more trap like girls. I feel like this has been a way I have just been coping with the fact I am trans for all these years. I have never found straight girl on guy porn as enticing, nor am I particularly interested in any of this sissy porn shit. I like the compilations of attractive girls and often the music but I hate the degrading ‘you are a faggot you must suck cock’ captions they’re a total turn off.

I’m confused as shit though. I have been thinking about taking hormones for years. I told myself I would decide if I am or not by 20 never look back but I’m still deciding. I feel in everyday life absolutely fine, I have absolutely no social dysphoria. I also have absolutely no genital dysphoria as I’m not an enormous fan of P or V. Infact I’m almost glad I have a penis instead due to the fact I can have sex with my girlfriend. 

But I’m completely indifferent about my appearance. I feel as though my life would’ve just been much happier if I was born female. I love women’s clothing compared to men’s, I buy my girlfriend clothes, shoes, and makeup all the time. I absolutely love female fashion and feel completely restricted and just outright awkward men’s clothes shopping. I love things like going to get nails and lashes and brows done with her but I can never take part. I am just outright confused about this, my body makes me feel completely disgusting when I do what I love, putting on a wig and makeup and jumpsuit to go out to a bar with my girlfriend. I just stand in the mirror feeling upset with my masculine features. I absolutely love romance too. I wish I could just greet my girlfriend at the door fully made up with a nice set of lingerie on but when I have attempted this in the past I have wimped out due to body insecurities. I have always wanted boobs since as long as I can remember. 
This whole situation scares me.

On the one hand I have had transgender thoughts since I was a kid and have a lot of female interests. But because I have lived as a guy for all these years the thought of changing my name and being called by female pronouns kind of weirds me out. After all I am a 21 year old male with a girlfriend in a good job and have a very male attitude with other guys, I go to the pub play,call of duty and gamble on football/horses. It sounds like some sort of complete mental breakdown.

Am I trans or some sort of dual gender? 
Although I don’t have genital dysphoria now, I imagine I would have if I transitioned due to me being unable to wear the clothes I want to? 
Will my sexuality change from hormones? 
Will I lose my ability to pleasure my gf? 
Will my family hate me? 
Will I be fired from my job? 
Can I keep taking hormones quiet until I feel personally comfortable that I will not look like a bad cross dresser? ( imagine this will take me 1-2 years) 

I have been suffering from really bad anger issues sometimes when I am thinking about this and stressing and someone interrupts my thoughts, will hormones fix this? 

I’m kind of sure I’m trans really really really  struggling to come to terms with it. I rang a children’s trans charity once when I was little to ask advice and hung up when someone picked up the phone. 

Does the fact that I have watched so much trans porn and I am also interested in plastic surgery/bimbofication a sign that this is some kind of AGP fetish? I get an erection sometimes at the thought of having boobs and a tanned body with long hair but I am torn whether this is excitement or some form of AGP?

Pretty much just argh? Not the fun, piratey argh, the 'buries face in pillow and screams in frustration' kind of argh.

I've (AMAB, 32) recently admitted to myself that somethings not where it was just assumed to be with regards to my gender. I had kind of realised it a ways back. But more in the, this is a little quirk I have, kind of way. In that, Ive always felt a kind of rightness playing as a female character in games, and there's no reason that *anyone* shouldn't regardless of gender identity. And so that's what I thought with regards to myself. It doesn't mean anything.

I've also liked dresses, leggings, tights and skirts for a long time. Again, there's no reason anyone shouldn't, there is not a single reason that anyone at all shouldn't wear a skirt or a dress. And so that's what I thought with regards to myself.

I've also... Envisioned myself as female in regards to... Private activities. And.. There's no reason anyone shouldn't? Anyone can fantasise about that...? And so that's what I thought with regards to myself...

So basically a little while ago, I had the errant thought of, ""hey wait, am I... Am I gender fluid? Or some other degree of NB?"" and that hit me like a truck. I didn't have an answer right away. I've never felt any particular affinity to my 'maleness' in any way, I hate the idea of acting like a ""manly man"" and feel like I have to put on such an act at work and in public. So... Yes. Maybe? Maybe I am.

The problem is, since that, and since discussing that with my partner, (who is super supportive but worried about my safety down the line). The walls didn't stop crumbling down. I don't find I have any particular dislike of my body, other than a vague disconnect to who I see in the mirror. But the idea of having a more female body resonates pretty strongly in me.

So now I just don't know, all I know is that my AGAB doesn't fit. But I can't work out if genderfluid is just a convenient middle ground to my brain, a stepping stone that feels a little safer (if as misunderstood) than being trans. And I don't know how to work it out. It's just a mental mess that I'm very very slowly detangling.

2020-01-16 19:09:23,epnxdl,7,1,"Hi all,

First of all I want to say that I am a cis woman who is a massive ally of the trans community and LGBTQIA+. I teach at a college and always invite guest speakers so my students learn about trans health and issues. My hb is a MD and treats trans patients too, he is doing a few courses to better serve these patients. 

But I have a personal question and I hope people 3ho have been on both sides can shed some light. 

I know that hormones aren't the whole picture in gender. Society and socialization are huge too.  But over the years, through my own experience and analysis,  I have noticed that hormones are huge. I feel so feminine and pretty on estriol, crazy on bc pills (estradiol and progesterone), and very sharp but agressive when my T is high (i have PCOS). 

Many years ago, I dated a man who was such a masculine cis guy. His testosterone was like 1000 or higher (he got it tested). Our relationship was torrid but ended up failing. We didn't get along and our love languages were opposite.  Besides the bed, he was v pragmatic and not emotional. He emphasized being rational and collected and poised, and didn't seem to understand my love style. At the time, I was on birth control, so I was overwhelmed by estradiol emotions. I was very expressive and felt so in love and passionate, I fely like talking about my feelings of love all the time etc.  I always wondered how men with high T (cis or trans) esperience love vs cis or trans women? Is it more of a : i do things for you so I love you? 

Fast forward many years, I married a man who has half the T. He is way more empathetic and responsive to my feelings and open to listening and talking. It makes me feel like he ""loves me more"". But that may not be the case. It may simply that testosterone makes love different. 

I hope no one is offended by this question.  
TLDR: how does Testosterone affect your feelings and experience of love in a relationship? 

Best,

i told her i needed time to think about it, and yesterday i thought i’d made up my mind and was about to tell her, but now i’m having doubts again. i know her parents would be supportive, but even so, i’ve only met them once or twice and i just don’t know how i feel about that. additionally, them knowing would mean doubling the amount of people i’m out to (2 → 4), and every time I come out to someone it’s difficult because it makes me feel like i’m sorta “locked in” in a sense. because i’m like 99% sure that i’m trans but i’ve always had that one sliver of doubt which i don’t think will ever go away. and the more people i come out to, the more afraid i get of the possibility of someday having to tell everyone i was wrong and i’m not trans. but, like... i *know* i am, and i’m *consciously aware* of the fact that my brain is making me doubt myself when i shouldn’t, but it’s still impossible for me to admit to myself “i’m 100% sure i’m trans.”

I woke up the next morning, next to my beautiful girlfriend. The love of my life. After all the shit I’ve been through, she’s the light that makes every day shine. I kissed her forehead and went into our small kitchenette to make breakfast. 

Ten minutes later she’s hugging me from behind, begging for a good morning kiss. I oblige, and as soon as we part she says “you wouldn’t believe what I dreamed of” — “it won’t come within a mile of my dream: a voice told me the cis people would be gone for a week” — “Uh…”

We make plans. We wonder what can we do now that the cis people aren’t here. Not the allies. Not the oppressors. I mean, it is for a short time. We only have a week to do everything we want to do.

Suddenly, out of nowhere comes a tune. The Imperial March. Darth Vader’s theme. A dreadful feeling fills me up. This can’t be happening. That’s the melody I’ve got assigned to Transphobic Piece of Shit number one. That’s my father. He should be gone. Gone!

So here is where I am at in my understanding... I have two differeing perspectives here. I need your help in discerning some things.

-which perspective do you prefer, 1 or 2, or do you have a mix/differing perspective entirely?
-Are either of these perspectives offensive, if so how?
-Anything else you can add. Opinions, thoughts, experiences, etc.

So the first perspective... I have met people who claim a variety of different things about what it means to be trans. From my understanding, being trans means that you are uncomfortable in your own skin and that you wish to physically transition because of this. Being trans is not an identity to you. You are male or female and would prefer to be referred to as such and simply skip the ""trans"" label. You are willing to tell people yes I am trans, but your gender identity is still simply male or female.

The second perspective... I have heard from some people who are trans that they do not wish to be lumped in the same category as those who see transgender as an identity and refer to themselves as a gender in-between or non-binary. Is it offensive to you for these people to be lumped in the same category as someone who transitions and simply identifies as male or female? Is it not offensive? Are these people also trans or is there something else you would call them rather than trans? For instance, if a man doesnt change his gender but wears a dress and says he is trans but his gender is something in between male/female, how does this make you feel? 

Thank you for your feedback. I am sincerely trying to understand this issue and wish to know what I can avoid doing as to not offend others because it is starting to get to a very confusing place for me.

Most of my teachers are pretty chill. All my teachers call me max. They use the wrong pronouns (she instead of he)

But whenever they have subs I get super anxious.  Here are two reasons why. There are others but honest those two stuck with me. 

Example one:
I went up to the sub,asking her not to call my birthname on the till, and she looks me dead in the eye and says “then legally change it”

Example two, which took the cake and happened yesterday:
I walk up to the sub and say “Hi, it says *deadname* on the roll, please don’t call that name” or something like that. She goes “let me see your drivers license.”  Now, I’m 15 and don’t even have a permit (I just turned 15 in the beginning of January) and I told her that. She goes “let me see your id” and I don’t have one so I told her that. She then says “then how are you going to tell me that’s not your name?” And I’m fed up at this point so I just say “ I’m trans. My name is max. Nobody in this class knows that I’m trans and I’d appreciate if you wouldn’t out me” and this bitch goes “Max is a girls name, too” and I just walk away. She calls my birthname anyway and outs me to the entire class. And then she wouldn’t let me go to the school counselor. And then calls me my birthname on the way out of the classroom.

Starting since I was 11 or 12, everyday I’ve questioned if I was really a boy instead of a girl. It’s actually more of like a burning thought in my head rather than a question. This probably sounds like a very sound case of being trans, but I also have really strong (diagnosed) OCD which results in intrusive thoughts, and I have an inkling this might just be one of them. I know I should be telling a therapist this instead of reddit, but I am not in a safe place to ask for help and I just really need some guidance.  Below, I put together a pro and con list of why I think I might be trans, and why I think I’m not. Thank you for your help!

Pro trans:
- puberty was pretty terrible. I didn’t get chest development until I was older, and was very proud when people pointed out that I was flat, and said that I must be a boy. When I eventually did, I went to great lengths to hide them, and only wore sports bras. 

-phantom penis. I hate having what I have down there, and it just doesn’t feel right. My whole life I’ve had the experience of a “phantom penis”, which is where I physically feel one, but don’t have one. I have never heard of any other trans men having them however. This could just be a part of my ocd. 

- never been able to masterbate. Sorry, this is a little gross. I just can’t handle the thought of touching down there, and every time I’ve tried I got confused, disgusted, and upset. I feel like having a penis would make it so much better. 

- I hate how curvy my body is. I hate my thighs, butt, waist, and chest. I always think about how much happier I’d be if I was just flat all over. I’ve tried wearing double sports bras and wearing shapewear to make myself shaped like a guy, and I loved it. I felt like I looked so right. 

- I feel so good dressed in men’s clothing

- I have height dysphoria so badly. I am only 5’2, but I wish I could be so much taller. 


Reasons I’m not:

-I have ocd, and get intrusive thoughts often. These could just be intrusive thoughts. 

-I’m very insecure with the way I look as a female, and I might just want to escape the way I look by pretending to be someone else

-I like the way I’m treated by people because of how feminine I look. For the most part. 

- I really enjoy doing makeup. I know anyone regardless of gender can, but still.

2020-01-19 20:31:12,er1sgt,5,1,"How often have you been told *You need to be true to yourself *? For me it’s been countless times and I never understood it. Hearing the phrase was quite frustrating.

Last weekend I had an opportunity for the first time in my life after 50 years, where I was able to explore my gender identity without guilt,  shame or the fear of being caught doing something in secrecy.  

My wife discovered my stash of clothes 19 months ago and I discovered I’m a transgender AMAB a year ago tomorrow. She forced me to discard everything I had accumulated. This period of time was by far the most difficult of my life.

Last weekend  I traveled to a city and was staying in a hotel. Realizing that I’d have time to myself, I ended up buying a dress, bra and forms, jewelry, makeup and more beforehand. I told my wife my plans. It didn’t go over well but I forged on.

I got to the hotel and I dressed. I did my makeup. I did my nails. And then I sat there. In the silence it finally hit me, *I need to be true to myself!*  Sitting in a hotel room hiding who I’m struck me as so profound. Sure, my wife knew what I was doing. I wasn’t sneaking around anymore but sitting there made it feel like a fetish, something to be shameful of. I just wanted to scream out to the world this is who I’m am! Please accept me. I realized dressing in a glorified closet would never be enough!

I got home and was wearing a necklace that I bought for the occasion. It was closer to feminine than gender neutral.  The first time I put it on, in the hotel, the euphoria was amazing. Wearing it all weekend and feeling it shift as I moved was a gentle reminder of the woman I’ve concealed from the world and myself since I was 5 years old. That night, I saw a disgust in my wife’s eyes as I attempted to come close to her. She eventually said she couldn’t take me wearing the necklace. In that moment, her reaction cemented my newly found realization, *I need to be true to myself* but was crushed because I also realized that my wife doesn’t want me, she wants the man she married 36 years ago. 

I realize now that I do need to be true to myself but doing so isn’t easy. I know I could fall back into the compromises life that I’ve led but I just can’t any longer. I’ve opened up the bottle and unable to put the genie back in.

Hi everybody! I am doing this short film about transphobic discrimination, our world's current culture of violence, and how teenagers can be mentally destroyed by forums online, to end up damaging their health and of those around them. I want it to be nuanced and dark, but I am not a trans woman (I am non-binary), so I also want it to be respectful to this community, and to portray your experiences correctly. Doing this character is so far, very difficult, so I would really appreciate the insight.

**The movie runs like this:**

We follow a trans girl named Natalia, who is in a very poor mental state, having recurrent dreams about a male prisioner being thrown out of a roof (it is important to say that we never actually see the Prisioner's face). She lives alone, because her parents threw her out when they discovered that she was trans, and she also is a victim of bullying.  The attacks that she receives are brutal, and heavily centered on the fact that she does not ""pass"", and it is through these that she becomes heavily obsessed with her appearance. In this search of community and peace, she finds a  forum in Fourchan, a very transphobic one, in which her facial features and gestures are criticised (similar to an InCel Forum). As both the bullying and her online obsession progresses, she begins to harm herself, submerging her mind in an utter state of violence.  The dreams of the Priosioner continue, becoming clearer and more painful for her.

&amp;#x200B;

The film goes to its climax when her bullies dress in masks and assault her on-campus. Natalia becomes the victim of a brutal hate crime, in which she is kicked, spat on, and slurred. After being threatened with a gun, she manages to snatch it away, to kill her assaultants in a fit of anger and fear. Once she realizes what has happened, she panics, and decides to run home. 

&amp;#x200B;

The final scene has Natalia looking at herself in the mirror just after getting home. While she takes away all of her makeup and accesories, the scenes of the ""Prisioner dream"" play again. Finally, the man looks to the camera, revealing to us that it is, indeed, Natalia. As the blood of her assaultants covers her bathroom, she stares at herself while holding the gun. We cut back to see the head of the Prisioner falling from the roof, heavingly implying Natalia's own death. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, that final scene is supposed to convery the idea of Natalia's desire for personal liberty against the violent repression that she lives. The Prisioner is the ""man"" that society weaponizes against her body and identity, as well as an impersonation of how the transphobia of her environment is destroying her mind, never allowing her to be free as the woman that she is. I swear that I will be careful when shooting it, so the deeper concept is communicated, and no accidental transphobia can be read from it.

2020-01-20 04:15:22,er7vas,3,1,"Hi, everybody. This has been through at least 4 re-writes. Hopefully it makes sense now :)

Since I was in my teens, I liked the idea of wearing women’s clothing, however due to pretty obvious reasons, I’ve been very closeted about it.  Recently, however, I decided to say 'F\*\*k it' and be open about it to people.  I started by coming out to a very good friend of mine, let’s call her Amy, and asked if she could help me out with picking clothes, styling etc.  Amy was incredibly sweet and supportive (as usual) and seemed genuinely interested in helping me out (I say “seemed” because I’m terrible at reading people and their intentions, so I never really know what people mean; also I have abysmal self confidence and self esteem).  Amy will be coming over to my place tomorrow AM to help me with this and I’ll be making lunch.

But here’s the thing: while the clothing aspect is important to me, I’ve been really wanting to go all the way as a woman. You know, dress up, wear makeup, walk etc.  Basically, I want to pass as a woman.  In fact, I’ve been thinking of transitioning for some time (long story).  To make matters more complicated, while I do like girls no doubt, I’ve also been very sexually curious about guys over the past few years.  Since I’m seeing Amy tomorrow, I’m really hoping to take this time open up to her and maybe hear what she has to say about all this.

My questions are: first, is all this too much?  I have autism (which she knows) so I’m utter rubbish at reading people and social cues.  She means the world to me, so the last thing I want to do is make it weird/too intense for her and risk ruining our friendship.  Second, how can I ask for help both emotionally and ""physically"" during this whole process, but without being being pushy?  She’s always been incredibly wonderful to me, but I’ve lost close friends due to misinterpretations and poor social skills.  Amy means the world to me and I’d hate myself if did anything to push her away.

Of course, if you have any other thoughts and ideas are more than welcome.

Obviously you need to either live in mtl or having access to it. It call *Center for Gender Advocacy* (at  2110 Mackay Street, Montreal, Canada) and people there are really sweet and helpful if you're not exactly sure of something.

Also, it is accessible for disabled folks since it on the ground floor, though doors aren't automated which could cause a problem, here more information on that (  [https://genderadvocacy.org/accessibility/](https://genderadvocacy.org/accessibility/)  )

They have Underwork binder (long and short) that they suggest for 20-40$, but won't turn down anyone who might not be able to pay that much. They also have donated binder which is always available for free.

Here the link for more information about it (you will be send to the binder page):

I mean I’ve known him for 15 years as a boy so it would take some time to get used to, but I would support him if the time comes where he does want to come out.  But, I have worries.

I just want the best for my brother and I want him to be okay.  People say that this is because society, specifically family, doesn’t accept who they are, but this number is still higher than JEWS in concentration camps or SLAVES.  That worries me.  I feel as if there’s another reason for this other than just society not accepting them.  If anybody could give me that reason, it would be appreciated.

I just want the best for my brother and I want him to be okay.  People say that this is because society, specifically family, doesn’t accept who they are, but this number is still higher than JEWS in concentration camps or SLAVES.  That worries me.  I feel as if there’s another reason for this other than just society not accepting them.  If anybody could give me that reason, it would be appreciated.  I just want my brother to be okay and never have thoughts like suicide.  Sorry if I offended anybody during this post, feel free to correct me.\n\nThanks!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I have a question.', 'created': 1579582127.0}"

Is being transgender about the genitalia or the gender stereotypes?

So my best friend is getting phallo in March and I wanted to make him a gift basket for surgery preparation/ recovery.

Now, I want to help someone else have the same security/safeness? I felt. I’d like to give them away for those who really need them. 

Now, I tried researching my local area and kept my eyes open for local lgtbs2q+ donation drives, made phone calls and sent out emails to my local groups regarding my donation but never got anything back. I thought about doing a give away? but I was always intimidated by the thought of doing it, because I really didn’t want to offend anyone or make them feel invalid in any way. 

I don’t mind paying the shipping to have them sent out anywhere in Canada, I’m also not opposed to shipping them internationally. I just want to help and give them a home.

I'm 27, born male, bisexual.

I've been a very shut in person when it came to my sexuality because of my internalised expectation of my friends and families reaction to my coming out as bi.

2020-01-23 00:02:13,eskobc,5,1,"(TL;DR 9/11 turned me queer)

I know, scandalous a little. You just had to click on it to find out more. Keep reading I swear it’s not complete clickbait.

1st thing I’ll say is I’m mtf. The 2nd thing I’ll say is that there’re three memories I have that are earliest in my mind.  1 is of jumping in a crib at my parents friends house.  2 is of me playing Spiro with my friend (Who we will call ‘Paint’ for this story because I think that’s a funny name).  3 is of me hiding under a blanket as my parents scream at each other. I talked to my mom recently about an article we both read about memory. This made me find out a lot more about one of these three memories.


The title ‘9/11 TURNING ME QUEER’ happened on the same day I first played video games. It had also been a weird day to start out with. I was so young that it was hard to form and remember coherent thoughts and I was starting to notice. I must of been 2 or something at the time and was hanging out at my friend Paints house. Paint was showing me how to play Spyro. She was older than me by a few years. It was hard for me to understand that I was controlling Spyro on the screen. Paint kept getting mad at me when I would rum into things. Eventually I got it.

She had an older brother who would talk to us sometimes. As I played the game I was thinking about Paint and her brother and how they relate to me. I had some thoughts that went something like this: Paints brother is a boy and I’m a boy. Paint is a girl but in the game I’m Spyro. I wish I was a girl like how Spyro is me in the game. These were the first complex thoughts I ever had.

Instantly I started to feel uncomfortable for having that thought. I felt like I had done a terrible thing and everyone around me could either hear my thoughts or were going to find out I wanted to be a girl just by looking at me. I thought I would be in huge trouble for it. My mom picked me up earlier than she said she would. She was really upset and acting weird. I thought she somehow knew and was really mad at me for being a girl. In fact all the adult were acting weird. I thought they all knew and hated me for not being a boy. 

Turns out, I found out from my mom yesterday, god damn 9/11 was happening that day. Their looks of distraught had nothing to do with my 2yo dysphoric ass! The only reason Paints mom was having us play Spyro was to keep us away from the TV (I wasn’t allowed to play video games at the time).

When we got in the car and started driving home my mom was still acting weird. I was just so sure she knew. I played off my distress by chatting her ear off about all cool things I learned about the game Spyro. I wanted to ask her If she knew I was a girl but was too scared to do so. Instead I asked something like “Are you mad that Spyro is a girl and I played it?”. She said It’s fine to play girl games and we never really talked about it again.


All these years later and I think the only reason I never ended up playing Spyro in full is because it caused me so much powerful dysphoria to think about that moment. Talking about this stuff has really been a great segway into talking about my true gender with my mother. Tonight I finally dropped the mask and had the whole “Mom, I’m a women” talk with her. It’s been good. She tells me all these little things I said and did as a child that I can’t remember and it’s like putting all the pieces of the queer puzzle together, as a family.

If your fretting over telling one of both of your parents about your true gender then take a second and reflect on how much of they’re perceived unaccepting your projecting onto them. Just because a lot of trans people have a horrific coming out story it doesn’t mean yours will be. Your family is going to find out someday wether you tell them or not. It’s better to test the waters and see what your dealing with than live in fear of what it MAY be like when you finally tell them.

If the situation is too dire for you to ever be accepted then girl stealth your way out of that situation and go live your best life away from them.",trans,9/11 turned me QUEER,1579762933.0,"{'created_utc': 1579737733, 'id': 'eskobc', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '(TL;DR 9/11 turned me queer)\n\nI know, scandalous a little.

I must of been 2 or something at the time and was hanging out at my friend Paints house. Paint was showing me how to play Spyro. She was older than me by a few years. It was hard for me to understand that I was controlling Spyro on the screen. Paint kept getting mad at me when I would rum into things. Eventually I got it.\n\nShe had an older brother who would talk to us sometimes. As I played the game I was thinking about Paint and her brother and how they relate to me. I had some thoughts that went something like this: Paints brother is a boy and I’m a boy. Paint is a girl but in the game I’m Spyro. I wish I was a girl like how Spyro is me in the game. These were the first complex thoughts I ever had.\n\nInstantly I started to feel uncomfortable for having that thought. I felt like I had done a terrible thing and everyone around me could either hear my thoughts or were going to find out I wanted to be a girl just by looking at me. I thought I would be in huge trouble for it. My mom picked me up earlier than she said she would. She was really upset and acting weird. I thought she somehow knew and was really mad at me for being a girl. In fact all the adult were acting weird. I thought they all knew and hated me for not being a boy. \n\nTurns out, I found out from my mom yesterday, god damn 9/11 was happening that day. Their looks of distraught had nothing to do with my 2yo dysphoric ass! The only reason Paints mom was having us play Spyro was to keep us away from the TV (I wasn’t allowed to play video games at the time).\n\nWhen we got in the car and started driving home my mom was still acting weird. I was just so sure she knew. I played off my distress by chatting her ear off about all cool things I learned about the game Spyro. I wanted to ask her If she knew I was a girl but was too scared to do so. Instead I asked something like “Are you mad that Spyro is a girl and I played it?”. She said It’s fine to play girl games and we never really talked about it again.\n\n\nAll these years later and I think the only reason I never ended up playing Spyro in full is because it caused me so much powerful dysphoria to think about that moment. Talking about this stuff has really been a great segway into talking about my true gender with my mother. Tonight I finally dropped the mask and had the whole “Mom, I’m a women” talk with her. It’s been good. She tells me all these little things I said and did as a child that I can’t remember and it’s like putting all the pieces of the queer puzzle together, as a family.\n\nIf your fretting over telling one of both of your parents about your true gender then take a second and reflect on how much of they’re perceived unaccepting your projecting onto them. Just because a lot of trans people have a horrific coming out story it doesn’t mean yours will be. Your family is going to find out someday wether you tell them or not. It’s better to test the waters and see what your dealing with than live in fear of what it MAY be like when you finally tell them.\n\nIf the situation is too dire for you to ever be accepted then girl stealth your way out of that situation and go live your best life away from them.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': '9/11 turned me QUEER', 'created': 1579762933.0}"

The story: I consulted a therapist for gender therapy and he asked a lot about stuff, what therapists do, and the end of the line was that he can't offer me a therapy cause he only got capacity for a gender therapy but I definitely need help for my anxiety and depression too/first. What is very fair.
But he said that I would need help for my ""Depression and Borderline"" and I basically fell out of my chair because, uhm, that's a new idea?
(Before anyone asks, yes he most probably meant BPD with ""Borderline"". In German the word isn't really used in any other context, since it's not a German word, surprise.)
It wasn't an official diagnoses, rather an educated guess from him, so I'm tryin not to take that at face value, but he definitely thinks the propability is high.
So I googled the symptom list od BPD cause I didn't know that much about it and I see why he came to the conclusion but I also saw the symptom ""Unstable self-identity"" and such, sooo I think he might think that I'm not trans but confused, basically.
But, maybe I'm overinterpreting so I just wanted to know:

Onto my point, the gal is having issues dating. At first glance, I read the post thinking “dang sister aren’t we all” and I mean “we” as a species in solidarity.

But within the first few sentences I literally physically cringed, which is ironic. It was ironic because she explains she cringed having to state that she is a “cis White female” and that she wholeheartedly does not want anyone to assume she is trans. She believes she has been unable to date her whole life due to her preference of dressing in men’s clothing / like a man. 

I left a comment indicating that her cringing over clarifying her pronouns and gender isn’t something that is actually cringeworthy. I also tried to point out that having this view and so casually stating it is a red flag (to me), and to maybe consider the clothing isn’t the problem. 

She responded reiterating that she absolutely does not want anyone to think she is trans. She is vehemently against it. 

Y’all, I’m at a fucking loss here. I’m so used to the bigots, the people calling us sick or deviants. But a woman who likes to dress like a dapper man, who might actually understand a little bit what it’s like to be discriminated against for being yourself is absolutely disgusted to be associated with us. I just have no words. Like zero. I want to find an excuse for her but I’m literally dumbfounded. Are we really that disgusting? Should I just pack it in now?

I’m not sure why this is bothering me so much. I guess I just needed to vent. In the end I know I’ll forget about her by the end of the day, but right now I really just can’t believe someone is so scared of us they’d go through such great lengths to make sure they are not associated with us.

I've been reading about people on the spectrum (for autism) who are also transgender. It's been pretty interesting and made me think about my own experiences.

Some background: for me, sensory processing issues have been one of the most challenging things, even though I don't know being any way else. As a kid I didn't realize being in sensory and speech therapy and special education classes wasn't the norm. But it doesn't take too long to realize that perhaps the world isn't built for people like you.

As for social stuff, it's never come very naturally to me. I've had to teach myself, mainly through books and observation.

Same with gender. I've always been able to see the way people act, but decoding it has been harder. I'd consider myself a mostly binary trans person, but I'm also fairly gender fluid.

It doesn't take long to realize the world isn't built for trans or gender variant people either.

Could part of my transness and gender identity be related to the way I perceive the world? I don't know.

I decided to research and found some recent studies have looked at people who are autistic. The correlation shown was pretty interesting, with people on the spectrum being more likely to be more diverse in their gender expression or trans.

Some experience gender dysphoria, but some just appear to perceive gender differently too.

So I have kinda been questioning my gender for a while but recently this winter its really hit me and I've been doing a lot of soul searching, research etc. During that time I joined reddit and I've been lurking here for a while now. 
 
I've been experimenting with early transition steps (make up,wearing panties, exercises to look more fem.) And I was really euphoric the first time I tried dressing up.

2020-01-26 05:23:51,eu2nj4,0,1,"Hey peeps.

I just wanted to share my story as I have these both conditions happening to me. 

One way that my therapist helped me to distinguish is when looking in the mirror watch out for the questions that pop into your mind, do you ask yourself:“Do I look feminine” or “Am I pretty?” 

Now, there’s a good video by Contrapoints talking about how closely related these two topics of beauty and passing are.

But I have noticed for so many trans women, passing’s more important than looking attractive whereas for some other being attractive is a bigger factor than passing.

As a person dealing with both, I have a constant internal battle, if I pass my, brain immediately jumps into picking out flaws that relate to the insecurities many other women with BDD feel. If I think I look attractive, my dysphoria kicks in to point out how much I do not pass.

I think it’s really important to mention these two phenomenons are entirely separate. If you are confused about which one you have, please seek professional help as they are two entirely different conditions that can be misdiagnosed for each other. Just like how individuals with BPD can be mistaken for those suffering from Bipolar disorders.

There are some like me who have those two happening at the same time. I have days that I don’t feel these conditions as much and I feel a lot better about myself. Whereas, when those two go hand in hand, I feel crippled. 

I just wanted to know if anyone can relate, and regardless of what you feel, YOU ARE NOT VAIN. Please don’t blame yourself and call yourself superficial, it’s a lack of safety we feel because of our appearance. 

I’ve become much more comfortable in my skin after my surgeries, but my BDD only got louder since there’s more attention on it. For those of you who feel dissatisfied with your surgeries, maybe consider that gender dysphoria isn’t all that you’re dealing with.

2020-01-26 08:30:25,eu48in,0,1,"Hi all. I previously asked about how transpeople people categorized themselves in different categories like gender sexuality etc, and I got a new way to comprehend how transgender people are.  
This is the method

  
There are 5 categorize: Gender, expression, sexuality, presentation(how you dress), identity.  
in the categorize you can input the values 0,1,2,3 which are 0 = no gender, 1= male, 2=female , 3=both.

  
These are arranged as left to right- most important to less important factors from a biological perspective. This is my perspective though so you guys can debate which is more interesting all you want.

  
If someone is a female bisexual that dresses in whatever for example they would have 2,2,3,3,2.

However, if you are in a none stable state you might drift in between these so keep in mind that if you are a dynamic person you shift between those in months or weeks.

I would like to hear your opinions on this and see if I can add or fix stuff to make this a more plausible version so normal people can understand transgender people easier.

Not even sure what I am seeking, but our 13yo child born female recently (in the past three months) has come out to us as transgender. It was a progression, started as “gender fluid”, then about a month later was more decidedly trans male. We are very open and supporting family. I think this helped them a lot. We noticed at the start of middle school that he tended to gravitate to the LGBTQ community of kids. Both kids that were out and others who were not to anyone other than close friends. He has decided on a name, is curious about HRT and up to know we have been letting him explore all of it. We purchased some books for teens, we’ve been doing a lot of reading ourselves. He has suffered from anxiety and depression for some time now, even before coming out. My worry, we are still going to end up fucking this up. Kids at school are assholes, middle school is bad enough, this compounds it. His depression has increased and there is a darkness growing. Thankfully both of our children are very in tune with themselves and able to express freely. I guess I’m just looking for thoughts and ideas of what would have helped on your personal journeys.

I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable or unsafe because she lives in a very conservative part of the country so maybe nothing too girly but I do want her to be happy!

The issue I have is that every couple of weeks I will start to feel extremely uncomfortable with my body and feel absolutely certain I am a woman. Most of the time I feel comfortable as a guy, but I still get these feelings, and they aren’t great.

She texted me and said “I know you’re trans, I’m looking at your phone when I come home and we are going to have a talk.”
I have pretty bad anxiety and this freaked me out to no end,
I was sobbing uncontrollably, deleting messages and apps.
Hell I even had a reddit account but I couldn’t log back it because I deleted the app!
I was horrified, and just- absolutely scared.
She didn’t want me to be trans.
She always says “yoUr a GiRl wHo lIkes oNlY BoYs” (I’m bisexual btw)

2020-01-28 23:11:04,evdjjn,14,3,"Hiya there my lovely trans family! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 My name's Marnie, and I'm an indie author who in the last couple of months released her first ""official"" book! Yay! \^\_\_\^ Unfortunately, releasing a book by yourself means if you want anyone to see it, you have to do the leg work yourself! =)

So I'm starting out small with trying to at least build a foundation of reviews for my book on its Amazon page. This will be the first giveaway I have, and I will have another one at some point in the near future.

Anyway, I have 10 copies of my book, *Ouroboros Reborn,* to give away today. For details about the book, look here at a previous comment of mine and its Amazon page:

[https://www.amazon.com/Ouroboros-Reborn-Marnie-Jude-Desdemona/dp/1686348053/ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=ouroboros+reborn&amp;qid=1580249141&amp;sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Ouroboros-Reborn-Marnie-Jude-Desdemona/dp/1686348053/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ouroboros+reborn&amp;qid=1580249141&amp;sr=8-1)

I am only looking for people who think they'd genuinely be interested in the subject matter of the book, so I can get better feelings from people in their reaction to it. There is some heavy, dark, and graphic content within the book, so please steer away from it if you have sensitives and triggers to such things.

I shall give books away on a first-come, first-serve basis (after you've read up if it's right for you), and there's only two things you are required to do if you accept a book from me:

\-If you accept a book from me, when you are finished reading it, please write a review on Amazon for it. Positive reviews, especially 5-star ones, would be amazing for me, but you are not required to rate or review positively at all. 

\-If you enjoy the book, please spread the word and share its existence! Tell your friends, family, and internet posse about it!

I will pay to ship the book to you, unless you offer to pay for shipping, which would be nice. \^\^ Due to not having the most money, I can only afford to ship within the United States.

That's all for today, and I hope you're all having a rocking Tuesday! Probs won't be around right now, but I'll be back around later tonight!

After 3 months I've finally got an answer to my referral to the gender clinic... aaaand I'm on the ass end of a 5-7 year waiting list. My dysphoria's usually mild at worst (with the occasional dark spike), trying to dream of the best, that it'll be fixed soon, but when I read that I had the strongest impulse so far to just put a rubber band over the unsightly appendage and wake up without it. The only thing that stopped me was knowing I'd never get my vagina if I did... and slightly headbutting the nearest wall. I've also been thinking about buying hormones off the internet but I'm worried about receiving something dodgy and growing scales or something.

I've come to terms with my situation. I can bite the bullet and wait four years with the self-promise that a) I focus strictly on my academics and my internships. Be a FANTASTIC student for four years. and b)  I hit the ground running once I land a job, and start transitioning ASAP. ""I've worked hard for this. I can support myself. I deserve this."" And have an amazing partner to see me through it, and see me be the woman I see to be.

I'm still on the edge about the decision.

My fiance is a ftm trans and he's looking for a top surgery. I have a lot of questions and I want to help anyway I can. I've tried looking up info online but I always find mixed information, so clarification is greatly appreciated. 

So for top surgery, I've read that you need a therapist to give a written letter to the surgeon, basically like a ""good to go"" letter. Can any therapist do this, or does it have to be a therapist with a wpath certification? This seems to be the hardest step is finding a therapist that can do this.

So first, I am a 17 YO male, and I am trying figure out whether I am truly male, or if I've just been lying to myself to not face potential judgement from society, friends, and family. Or even if I'm neither all together. I guess first, I would say that if I were given the chance to be female for a month or two, or even up to a year, I would take it. In addition, I would consider myself to have a more female personality (I don't really know how to explain it) Aside from that, I've found myself to be hanging out with girls more often that boys because they match my personality more than moat boys. However, by closest friends are male, including my best friend of eleven years. Next, I have no opposition to be wearing female clothing, and I would have female clothing in my wardrobe if society would be more accepting to it. 

But at the same time all together, I don't exactly feel fully female, and still have many male aspects of me. 

Aside from this, if I were.to switch, it would create a multitude of problems. First, I'm a Boy Scout, so there'd obviously be a problem there. Next, I am a competitive swimmer, so that would also be a big problem. I also have a gf at the moment, though she's bi so I guess it wouldn't matter that much (if you really want to know, we've been friends for a good five and a half years, and we've been dating since mid november of last year). And then if I do start therapy at all, I would think I'd be starting on the late side since I'm already well into puberty (like already growing a little bit of a beard)

So I don't know if I am male, or if I'm just hiding it from myself to avoid any problems and lashback or judgement. Any opinions would greatly be appreciated, especially from people who've been in the same place I'm in.

If it helps, here are some things about me if its relevant: I am GT/TAG, ADHD, am depressed (it runs in the family), and have Reactive Airway Disease, a form of Asthma. I am a huge nerd, and I specialize in Aerospace engineering and Astronomy. I'm also a cellist.

Secondly, I am in need of some advice. I am not trans, but one of my best friends (I'll call him ""A"" to avoid confusion) is a trans male. Met him through school just this year. A is a fantastic guy and I love him to death.

 A has started to openly socially transition, and has been using his new name and preferred pronouns for three months (give or take). It has been a bit rocky, as our teacher and some peers are still adjusting to the changes (they had all known him under his birth name and pronouns before this point).

\- I and another friend use the correct pronouns when referring to A.

I have always felt like I was female, despite being AMAB. I didn't know anything about this world due to being raised in a strict religious household where LGBTQ+ stuff is evil and men have to be manly.


I have been ridiculed so many times for things as arbitrary as my handshakes not being masculine enough. This has made me absolutely despise handshakes. 


My voice has never been deep, but not fully high either. I hate vests, suits, ties, pants, and anything else that is typically male. I pretty much only wear shorts and t-shirts year round. I now realize that this may be because that is the closest thing that is societally accepted for a man to wear...as opposed to skirts and dresses. In a perfect world, I'd be a girly goth girl...like long black hair, black make-up, black dress...that kind of stuff. Lol. 


I first wore a dress as part of a Halloween costume when I was in second grade and it just felt so right. It was a dark purple velvet dress. I was a female vampire and whenever anyone would make comments about me being a vampire, I would correct them and say I was a female vampire.


I talked to my mom and close friends about becoming a woman when I was 15, but due to my world, nothing ever became of that. 


Here I am 17 years later and a friend introduced me to egg_irl and everything began to click and fall into place again.


That, plus conversations with some awesome friends, led to the final realization that I am a trans woman. 


I bought a wig and a skirt yesterday and they just felt so right. When I took them off, the dysphoria kicked back in hardcore.


I am trying to get into therapy and to a doctor because I wanna start HRT...but I have a crippling fear of doctors and therapists.


I have come out to some close friends and they are super supportive, but I'm afraid of what certain family members will think...

So here's what I came here to discuss: whenever I'm driving a woman around, whether it's a friend, a girlfriend, a family member or whatever I typically open their door for them when we walk to the car. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but most women seem to appreciate it. My trans best friend is now the woman she feels like she was born to be, and so last night when we were hanging out I opened her car door for her, but a part of me felt like it came off like I was trying too hard to pander to the fact that she's a woman. I guess it stems from the fact that I probably never would have opened the door for her in previous parts of our friendship, so it almost felt conflicting in my head.

I'm trying my best to navigate this, and I'm so happy that she's now able to be the person that she wants to be and has that freedom to do so, but I also don't want to be ignorant so I'm coming here for discussion.",trans,My best friend is a trans woman,1580507153.0,"{'created_utc': 1580481953, 'id': 'ewpfyx', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Let me start this off by explaining that I am a cisgender straight Male.
