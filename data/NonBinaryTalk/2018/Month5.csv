Recently I moved to Kansas City, quickly I learned the scene was toxic &amp; full of hate amongst themselves. 
I noticed this through the various casual dating i’ve done since my relocating. I have always thought of myself as non-binary or genderfluid. I tend to call myself a lot of thing to help others understand. Throwing around words to simplify my existence for others. 
Gender fluid, non-binary, demisexual, &amp; Androsexual. These words have meaning to those that use them. They mean that I am aware of myself, aware of how others view me, &amp; wish to be respected. 
I decided to change my downward spiral that is my almost extinct social life. I decided to go out. There is a local hotspot in Kansas City called Hamburger Marys. Hamburger Marys was my first bar I found myself in when I moved to KC. I’ve enjoyed many shows, laughs &amp; drinks with friends. I recently braved the toxic community that can be found in KC &amp; came to Hamburger Mary’s to support my friends who are performers.
This evening in particular, I found myself on the patio smoking a cigarette. While taking a moment for myself amongst a packed event, I assisted someone who’s (for the sake of labeling, which I am not entirely comfortable doing) otherwise would be titled a bearded-queen. 
Having been a drag queen in my past I know how important it is to be there for your fellow performers. As I assisted this person a feeling of nostalgia came over me. They thanked me by says “you’re the nicest gay man i’ve ever met” 
I felt appreciated but compelled to correct them for being misgendered. This was the moment I no longer felt welcome. Following the correction the individual proceeded in poking fun at my reveal. Going on to record me for social media subsequently outing me as genderfluid and mocking me by saying “i’m Gender-fluid”. 
I walked to my corner where I perched to smoke my cig &amp; continued to listen to this person tell everyone around them of the hilarious video mocking me. Stating over and over again &amp; pointing me out to all of their friends. 
I sat there. Defeated. I rarely go out because of this very hate that is internalized within the Kansas City community. 

I try my best to keep my chin up &amp; let words roll off my back but this person went too far for me. This sort of behavior can no longer be acceptable. I’ve been contemplating what I should do. Should I inform the establishment of this hate? I don’t have social media because of this exact reason. My life is my own, how I share it with the rest of the world is my business &amp; not for others to mock, criticize or poke fun at.

2018-07-29 17:11:35,92wa2n,0,5,"Hey everybody,

I've just recently begun exploring my gender identity and I'm about to spend 4ish hours in a car so I was wondering--does anyone have a podcast (whole series or just single episode) that they endorse and recommend for thinking about questions of gender and non binary identities? 

If it helps to know more about me and where I'm coming from: I was assigned male at birth, I'm white and from a liberal pocket of the midwestern United States, and so far the terms ""androgyn"" and ""femme"" have seemed to resonate with me the most, but I've only recently realized this/let myself accept it so even broad topic podcasts would be good. I have done a little bit of internet research and reading already and was somewhat acquainted with broader gender definitions and terminology before though.
