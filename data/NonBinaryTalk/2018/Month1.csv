I would like to invite you to take part in a research study investigating how mainstream media depiction influences body image satisfaction for individuals who identify as non-binary. This research will form the data as part of my dissertation for my psychology degree.

Before you decide to take part, it is important that you know what the study will involve. This stud is conducted as an online one-to-one interview! The interviews aim is to encourage a healthy discussion regarding your opinions on the representations, or lack of, of people who identify as non-binary in the media, and how this affects body image satisfaction. This discussion will last around 1 hour.

[For online interviews only: you will need to have internet access, a facebook account and access to a computer/laptop. Participants MUST be those who identify as gender non-binary.]

If you would like to take part, then please contact me on: 14525479@students.lincoln.ac.uk.

I have a binder that I can only wear sometimes due to a medical condition with my ribs. I am so uncomfortable with my genitalia that it makes it near impossible to be intimate with anyone. I don’t know if it has to do with trust or if my dysphoria is getting in he way completely. The idea of starting T also terrifies me because there is really no way to determine what changes will happen. I know everyone’s body is affected differently, and I feel like many of the changes would help me a lot. But I am scared that any changes to my lower half could make me feel more uncomfortable. 
I really don’t have a community of anyone who identifies outside of the binary, so I feel very alone in my struggle. 
For anyone who is on T, did you ever feel this way? Or anyone who isn’t on T but has considered it, how did you get more information or figure out what was best for you?
