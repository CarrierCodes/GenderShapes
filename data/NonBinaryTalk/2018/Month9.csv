I am an AFAB 20 year old and this past year have struggled with my gender identity. Recently I decided that I wanted to cut my shoulder length hair because it feels more authentic to me and I am sick of people labeling me as the gender I was assigned. I am in college and I am at my parent's home for fall break, and leading up to break I was so excited and pumped to get my hair cut short, but these past couple days I have been feeling a lot of anxiety and making excuses to not cut it (my face is too round, my body doesn't look right yet). I'm just frustrated that my excitement flipped and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm thinking I may be feeling dysmorphic because my parents and siblings use she/her/hers and call me ""sister"" and ""daughter"" and ""woman"" to the point where I'm worried that I'm making my gender identity up, and if I should really cut my hair. I just wanted to reach out to this page to see if other people feel this way sometimes.",NonBinaryTalk,Cutting my hair today,1542753363.0,"{'created_utc': 1542728163, 'id': '9yt795', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey everyone I\'m very new to this subreddit but most of the people in my life are cis so it\'s kind of hard to talk to them.
