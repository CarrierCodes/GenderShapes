Thanks for taking the time to read and hopefully reply and provide me with advice. I’ve identified as DemiGuy for a number of years. The longer I’ve been in drug recovery and therapy the more I’ve been able to discuss and explore my gender identity. There’s days when I identify as either. I present male (beard and body hair). I use he/him and don’t like using “they/them” as they remind me of being bullied at school (being called “that thing” whilst “they/them” is not directly the same it reminds me of that time). Can I still use gendered pronouns and express my gender non-binary?

I’m really confused and this is effecting my relationships with people who assume or often tell me I should be using “they/them”
