2018-04-09 21:34:49,8b27zt,0,2,"I'm writing a piece for a new series on Tonic that will be helping people know what to say in awkward situations. Since I recently came out as androgyne, I had many conversations about what that meant, which pronouns people should use when they refer to me, whether or not I considered myself trans, and so on.

But I have only one voice that speaks to one specific experience and I'm looking to gather as many as possible so that when I write the essay, I can address the top five situations or problems people have faced when transitioning, whether physically or in the use of their pronouns. The top five will be given to an LGBTQIA+-friendly therapist who will work with me to develop the answers.

Feel free to write as many things as come to mind, whether they be things you've experienced first-hand, things you've been told about, or things you worry about for the future!
