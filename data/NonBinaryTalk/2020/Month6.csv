Then even more recently I really, really thought about it and my experiences and how I feel about being referred to as my birth assigned gender (female) and came to the conclusion I was nb (NB masc). I also talked with a close friend of mine who is NB too.
But as soon as I understood what were these dysphoria thoughts and how to recognize them instead of just brushing them off like before, it became ten times worse. Like before I didn't rlly worry about looking female and being considered as one and probably would've laughed at the idea of being NB, but now MAN the dysphoria is REAL AND THERE

2020-06-03 16:46:18,gvxgjp,0,3,"Hi fellow enbies!

Wanted to post to commemorate my 2 year coming out anniversary!!! Wooo!!!

June 1st, 2018 I came out as non-binary. It’s been a really difficult journey, but I’m still here and I’m still strong. I’m really proud of myself.

To my fellow enbies: it truly does get easier. It’s not easy, but I can live my life without having to think about it for long periods of time. I have supportive friends, but my family is not supportive—even having to spend all my time with them isn’t as damaging as it used to be.

Stay safe and strong. “It gets better” is not just words. It’s true. I know how hard it can be to see when you’re in the thick of it, but you just gotta take each day as it comes. Every day is better than the last.

If you’re thinking about coming out—it’s hard. It’s really hard. But it’s so much better than keeping who you are a secret. I finally feel free to be who I am. At some point, you won’t be able to constrict yourself any longer, and you’ll have no choice but to come out—if you can do it safely, do it early, so you have more life to live as your true self.

Here’s a little backstory. 
So this isn’t about me. I (23 F)  raise my 13 y.o. sister and I am trying my hardest to be the best faux parent I can. I love her so much. Life hasn’t been super awesome and blessed for us, but we are in a really good place right now. 
About a year ago she came out as bi. No biggie. Easy. I told her I love and support her and that it’s really not a big deal. She is who she is and I will stand by her no matter what. 
In the last year, one of her best friends has come out as female to male transgender. Again. Awesome. This kid is super amazing and I’m glad they are in my sisters life. This apparently really resonated with my sister. Yesterday she told me that after her friend came out as trans she started to think about the way she views herself and how she feels as a person. She said she thinks she is nonbinary or at the very least leans more masculine than a traditional female. Which is no surprise. I have been buying her a mix of men’s and women’s clothing for years and she recently shaved her head. (please forgive my use of she/her I am only doing it to make this easier to follow. She thinks she wants to go by they/them but is still thinking about it). 
She said she wants to start wearing a chest binder because she feels uncomfortable with how large her chest is. Now being a cis female I have no experience with this and no idea where to begin. 

Should I have her start wearing sports bras first to ease into it? Or should I invest in a binder for her? I know that if they are not worn correctly they can affect breathing and she’s still growing and developing so I don’t want to cause any problems. I just want her to be as safe as possible and any tips or advice would be amazing.

I’m AFAB, comfortable with my body, and high femme but I don’t like calling myself she or her or a *shudder* woman/girl. To me, dressing feminine is a kind of performance that I like leaning into like a positive mask. I can relate to a lot of struggles that women go through though and enjoy engaging with women centred feminist media. I often relate to female characters too. 

I know that gender is a spectrum and is fluid. But I’m wondering how much of my discomfort with being seen as a woman is to do with my race. I’m East Asian passing (mixed east and southeast Asian). I grew up with a white stepfather in a majority white town, where my mother was heavily fetishized. My brother, as a white passing cis male, was able to do whatever he wanted. He could play outside whenever he wanted while I had to stay inside and keep relatives sweet. 

I’m not sure if I was uncomfortable with being told that I was a girl, or being told that I couldn’t do things because I was a girl...or maybe it’s both?

Hi folks I’m struggling with something and was hoping I could get some advice. 

My best friend/brother from another mother who I love very much and probably wouldn’t be alive without him is getting top surgery. 

I’m that kind of parental hover friend (I’m working on it in therapy but still a struggle) who can be kinda controlling and overbearing. I’m super stressed and scared about it even though I know it’s a routine surgery and that it’s going to be fine. 

We also talk everyday over FaceTime and there’s been very few days in the last few years that we haven’t talked, well of course he’s going to need a few days to recover and so we’re not going to be able to talk. I’m currently working toward a game plan to spend some days with a friend in hopes of being distracted from the situation and not texting him every minute and stressing him out. 

Ok so here’s my questions. Can people who’ve had the surgery tell me what it’s like, especially the first few days as far as if you could comfortably talk to friends? Can I maybe get some stuff to calm my mind?

2020-06-11 18:23:39,h14ufb,0,3,"Non binary people: They are valid!
Before I go any further I want to mention that these are all my opinions coming from what I think it means to be non-binary. If you agree, great! I’m glad we think the same way. If not, I’m sorry if I offended you and please tell me what you think. I will also be using “we” and “our” and such, but it’s not because I’m a communist(I swear). So with that disclaimer out there I’m going to start.

1) Don’t take it too far
This is really only for Spanish (specifically in Argentina.) so you are welcome to skip this part if you’re not from Argentina or from a Spanish-speaking country. But I noticed that Argentina was taking it a bit too far, but since there are not many examples in English and this is in English so I will try to translate. In Spanish,
When referring to a group of men you say “TodOs” when referring to a group of women you say “TodAs” but when referring to a group of men and women you say “Todos” like how in English we say something like, “All man on earth” it means all humans basically. But in Argentina they’ve been saying “TodEs” which is a stretch. This part wasn’t very necessary but I wanted to include it.

2)Get used to the pronouns and names
This goes to anyone with a friend or family member that is non-binary or transgender. You should get used to pronouns, if you mess up it’s okay! As long as you correct yourself. But then again, you can only mess up so many times so eventually you have to learn them. It’s the same as learning a name, you remember it and refer to them as that. If you have someone that has changed their name, you should practice it. Nobody likes being called by their dead name. Again, correct yourself if you get it wrong and learn their name and pronouns ASAP. 

3)We are people
Just because we have different pronouns doesn’t mean we’re “special”. We want to be treated like people. If you can use she/her and he/him then why can’t you use they/them? Imma get a little harsh here but get the fuck outta here if you say, “I can’t do it!” Or “But it’s a plural pronoun!” If you say that you are being sexist (I think that’s what it’s considered as??) and transphobic. Non-binary falls under the umbrella of transgender. Obviously they’re different but we are technically transitioning into a more androgynous version. If you really support our community then 1. Learn our names and pronouns and
2.treat us like a person 

4) It is NOT a fad
I'm still shocked that people “become non binary” because it’s a “trend”. It is NOT a trend. We are real people that exist and have suffered through dysphoria, sometimes depression or other disorders, and sometimes transphobic families or friends. It’s like making fun of depression by pretending to be depressed. It’s dumb. It’s stupid.

I AFAB have in recent months wondered more and more on weather or not I am non binary. 
I feel like a women and I really relate to the femininity that is apart of me, but I have always wondered of being not a women even before I realized maybe I’m non binary. 
I am unsure though and fear that I only feel this because I want to be “different” that is horrible to say, so I am sorrry. I feel in me saying I am or feeling I am that I am disrespecting the trans/non binary community, because as I said I still feel like a women.. but also I don’t and just want to be like I AM ALL GENDERS BITCHHHHHH!!!!!!!
      (But like I can’t say I ENTIRELY FEEL THAT WAY.. but also I do wish I was all genders. ) 

Anyway a lot of the doubt comes from me feeling like this part of me that feels this because I’m thinking to myself that- gender isn’t real. I think that maybe it’s the expectations of what characteristics a “women must have” that I don’t agree with and know I don’t hold! I wonder if it’s just that I obviously am not gonna be everything society says women must be, because who is.... So I stop there and say no I’m a women but obviously gender norms are fake and all of that is fake. 
But then it lurks my mind again... and I think I want to be all genders.. and I would really like to be perceived as more than just a women (so again I struggle is it just me wanting to be different). 

I don’t hate my tits, i really like them actually, I don’t hate my vagina either.. I do though wish I had a dick.. or like ideally wish I could have both... like I wish I could switch between if I wanted my dick or vagina that day or that hour idk I just know that is something I wish I could have.. but i think again we’ll that doesn’t prove much either...

I also at times will see a post, or meme on having a gamer crisis and feel like I relate a lot... again Idk if it’s just me thinking that I agree when it’s not my truth. 

And then I think of my boyfriend (who isn’t straight) but is more attracted to women.. and I know he wouldn’t leave me or feel anyway different about me but in a conversation w had he told me “but I love women” or something along those lines 
and directed towards me in explaining his sexuality to me 
And I think of that and I fear but it’s so stupid because I know he wouldn’t care

But then it makes me also think how beautiful it is to be a women and I love that.

2020-06-17 09:53:26,hao7lj,6,1,"So I’ve recently figured out that I’m non binary after questioning a few years ago and then repressing it until now. I use they them pronouns and use a name I consider to be gender neutral. Someone referring to me as “she/her, girlfriend, female, girl, etc.” feels soooooo wrong but... I present mostly feminine.

I’ve tried telling my mum about this and asking her about calling me they/them pronouns but she thinks it’s only used for multiple people and refuses to use them.

2020-06-17 22:32:05,hb1s1g,6,1,"My story probably isn’t unique but I’d love to hear from others with similar experiences. I apologize if this is too long but I need to get it out. 


I’m AFAB, I’ve always been masculine my whole life up until the last few years before I came out as MtF. I attempted to be more femme because, well, I’m getting older and I felt like being a tomboy made me seem younger. I also am attracted to men and figured no men would be interested if I wasn’t feminine. But I have had top dysphoria as long as I can remember and top surgery is still something I 100% want to pursue. 

I have gone back and forth for a long time. Trying to find the answer in both gender and sexuality. I figured I must be a lesbian because I’m masculine and I have been with women and find them attractive. I finally started dressing very masculine, cut my hair short in a very masculine haircut, stopped shaving my facial hair (crazy genes) and it felt really really good. I thought because I enjoyed that, and enjoyed being called by male pronouns and that I could discard the things I didn’t like about being female (not being expected to act like a lady, or the idea of people actually respecting my expert opinion on things in my career) that I was indeed FtM. 


Let me say now that I am pre-everything aside from social transition. A lot of things felt euphoric, like buying my first pair of male shorts, and my first binder. But I still felt unsettled, like something wasn’t right. I have never been bothered by female pronouns, being deadnamed (as long as it wasn’t malicious.)But I hate things like being called dear, sweetheart, little lady, etc. I realized I don’t mind being perceived as a woman sometimes but I hate being perceived as feminine. It makes me uncomfortable. While I realize some thing are genuine dysphoria, others are just the shitty ways society treats women. And I guess I perceived a lot of these as reasons to why I’m FtM. 


I lost a bunch of weight a few years ago and at my lowest (still healthy) weight I was very androgynous and I loved it. My body type at an ideal weight is naturally androgynous, aside from my chest, which shrinks but is still noticeable. I don’t inherently hate the fact that I was born female, and I don’t have bottom dysphoria. Most times I feel masculine but I feel ok being a masculine androgynous person. I like my facial hair. I like having short hair. I like having a flat chest and wearing men’s clothing. I love when people call me dude and just treat me like one of the guys. And I love my chosen name (which happens to be genderless.) But I don’t feel painful bottom dysphoria, or hate my body aside from my chest (although I’d like to get back to my low weight.) I want to get top surgery eventually, and I have recently been looking into hormones but I’m not sure I actually want to do HRT. At the moment I pass almost completely with a binder on until I talk. I have a very angular jaw and masculine facial features. Honestly I’m pretty ok with where I’m at aside from my weight and I think I’m ok with the way that I am. I like the fact that, if I desire, I can still be seen as female. I feel connected with being female, but not with the feminine of that makes any sense??


I’m afraid because I have socially transitioned and I’d basically be “going back on” what I’ve said which as most know wasn’t an easy thing to do, but honestly most people (aside from my queer friends, who would understand anyways) don’t really get it.

TL;DR: AFAB enby feels like they are stealing the trans identity from ""real"" trans people because they don't suffer hard enough. 🙃 Does anyone else feel (or has anyone felt) the same way?  How do/did you deal with it? Any advice for talking myself out of this thought process?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm an AFAB soft-masc (soft-butch?) nonbinary person. 

My dysphoria doesn't make me particularly miserable.    It's uncomfortable, sure. But sort of like wearing shoes that are just too small. And most of my dysphoria is social rather than physical, so I am lucky to be a bit of a fence sitter when it comes to physical transition (and I may never *have* to go through the pain and financial hardship of medical transition.)  My main reason for coming out (to myself and others) was not that my dysphoria was causing me intense pain, but that I just wanted to accept myself and be authentic.  I just wanted to live as the gender that makes me happy.

I know a lot of nonbinary people don't feel that way at all, but from what I can tell milder dysphoria is more common among the enby community than the binary trans community.

Additionally, as an AFAB enby person who hasn't undergone hormone therapy, I have it a lot easier than most AMAB people.  In public, people just assume I'm a lesbian because it's much more widely accepted for people with feminine-looking bodies to wear masculine clothing than the other way around.  Non-allied family members better tolerate my presence because they aren't insulted or flabbergasted by my presentation, even if they disagree with my identity. This does have the reverse effect of making it difficult to get people to use my preferred pronouns, but at least I get less hate. People just dismiss or ignore me.

Even my very supportive friends and husband still slip up and reveal that they really see me as a woman.  Not just with accidental misgenderings -- those are to be expected -- but with the way they talk about me.  Hell, even I struggle to see myself *not* as a woman, even though the thought makes me cringe.  I misgender myself in my own head constantly.

So, because of all this, I have a lot of trouble with saying ""I'm trans."" I feel like I'm just a poser because my gender transition isn't as punctuated by pain and struggle. I don't even have that much dysphoria.  I'm ashamed to take on that label because I feel like I'm somehow taking away from the people who have to fight every day for their right to exist, or from people who have a hell of a lot more conviction and certainty about their gender identity than I do.  And besides, how am I even *trans* if my *transition* is just one pronoun-change away from being indistinguishable from a cis woman changing out her wardrobe -- especially when people still treat me like a woman and see me as a woman anyways (and always will, basically.) Sometimes I'm even ashamed that I came out at all.

2020-06-19 03:40:32,hbte3k,0,1,"Hey there,

Big TW I think... I'm new to reddit so forgive me if this is misplaced, if I've said or done anything incorrectly please let me know. 

TL;DR -  I feel i've always had issues my gender identity and sexuality and how those two interact. These are things I've never fully realised because of my own lack of understanding... Basically this is just a big brain dump. 

--

I am 26 AFAB. 

Growing up I was always a big tomboy. I wasn't exposed to gender roles, at least I was so aloof that I didn't notice. My mum would keep my hair short, so sometimes I'd rebel by refusing to cut it; I thought it'd make the other kids at school like me more. I have a lot of memories of roleplaying WWE with my brother and trying to get into fights with boys and getting angry when my brother would defend me.

I started high school, I was sent to an all girl's Catholic school and it was rough, there were very clear lines drawn for me. I wasn't allowed to use the wood shop because I was female, I couldn't access musical instruments because I was female. Just sit down and be quiet like a good wife would, is what I was being told. 

I would sit on my bed in the mornings before school and just feel like tearing off my flesh. There was something about that uniform that would just give me this sickening feeling in my stomach. I refused to wear dresses (outside of the uniform), I cut my hair and I started dating girls. I acted like a real king shit at this girls school, let me tell you... Word got around and I started getting picked on by older girls at the school, but whenever they'd grab me it'd just make me excited to fight. I used to think it'd be so much easier it I were a dude, but I thought maybe every woman thinks that to some degree. 

Around this time, I met a trans guy through the emo/scene crowd and we became good mates. I was 15 at this point, sometimes I'd strap my chest with bandages but mostly I just dressed in baggy clothes. I felt because my body wasn't 'slim' enough I couldn't keep pulling off the androgynous look.

Being trans back then wasn't really talked about the same way it is now, this was around 2009 in the suburbs, my friend found it easier to tell people they were butch and nobody even spoke about pronouns. We would go out to parties and get really rowdy together, I started asking people to call me by a non-gendered name because I claimed I ""was a man in my past life"", a narrative I later dropped and forgot about. Now the scene/emo crowd was an especially frisky bunch, it was fairly common for teens to be s**ually active. I was flirty and would pursue girls, but I never imagined having s** as the outcome, not with men, not with women. 

After l was kicked out of Catholic school, I left my town to change schools. I assumed that past me was confused and ignorant. I was a big dumb show-off who had to prove myself to everyone. Girls at this new school laughed at me when they found out I was a virgin, so, I thought it was something I needed to fix. I thought I needed to present myself in a way that was appealing to guys. An arty, cool older guy in the grade above me asked me out so I obligued. Then came my first time and it was uninteresting, uncomfortable and a bit freaky. I didn't want to touch or look at either of our genitals, and I spent the whole time staring at the clock. But I didn't think about this as a signifier that I wasn't as straight or comfortable with femininity as I wanted to believe. I just thought I'd 'get it' eventually.

Around this time I shaved my head into a mohawk, and started dressing more and more flamboyant, I didn't realise that my expression of sexuality and gender did not need to be considered in a cis hetero context. If I dressed like a woman I felt like I was putting on a costume, that I was proving to someone that I could be attractive if I wanted to be and how dare they tell me otherwise - this was considered fun to me, I never felt wrong dressing up, just amusing like an immitation or an act. I was heavily inspired by Bowie and I regularly performed in these outfits that would combine feminine elements like tights and sequined corsets with cowboy boots and suede jackets.

Then the body issue came back. I hated the soft, rounded body that I'd grown into, I wanted to be taller, I wanted more bones and less flesh. I didn't want breasts. I started dating a guy I felt I had control over, and I began to starve myself and cut myself off from my friends. I lost myself in that relationship and essentially wasted three good years of my early adulthood where I should have spent figuring things out. I became severely underweight but I didn't see how bad it was. When I had just started university, a guy in my cohort called me an ugly rat, I felt crushed, I felt like I needed to prove him wrong. I received criticism from teachers for singing in a way that wasn't conventional, or not dressing pretty enough for performances. I'd never felt so upset by what people thought of me and I hid my body. In this stage of my life I met my current partner and immediately left my three year relationship. 

From age 20 I tried so hard to clean up my act, I took out my piercings, would wear skirts and dresses and kept my hair nice. I thought I could conform to a normal state of being, at one stage outright rejecting everything I said and did as a teen. I felt that rejection extended into my own self expression, the longer I spent ignoring the world the harder it felt to open up. I stopped writing, drawing and listening to music. There was a huge deal of grief and this... hole that I couldn't explain and I couldn't fill. 

When my father very suddenly passed in an accident three years ago, I felt like my eyes were bashed open, I used that pain as momentum to make steps towards becoming a stronger human being and I started opening up to my partner and even made a couple friends. I spent years working up the courage to go out again, to be myself. 

Two years ago I shaved my head and this was the first time in years I started expressing my masculine side. I dressed up in a white suit for a work function and it sent everyone into a frenzy. I leaned into the persona, I was being unabashedly flamboyant and flirtatious. I felt confident. But suddenly I was being called a lesbian; despite being in a long-term relationship with a man. It didn't feel right. It kinda made me mad. I pushed it aside, but I'd become hyper aware of how people viewed me, and it wasn't delicate or femme, it was as an aggressive, masculine if not eccentric and female. But that's not it. 

I attended a work dress up party in a skirt last year and my boss expressed surprise and told me he thought I'd come in a suit again and it's cool if I want to *be both*, he said... ""Hey, it's 2019..."" 

I can't tell if what I really want is to get rid of that descriptive of woman, to get rid of the softness, the curves. I've built up this ineffective wall of 'normalcy', I've hidden the elements of my past self, I've existed to please people and now what? 

I don't want to co-opt anything that doesn't belong to me. I don't want to keep perching somewhere I don't belong. I look inside and feel like nothing, I'm an alien. An observer. I'm shapeless. Formless. But identify is not a tangible thing, I know I can't and don't need to prove anything to anyone. But...

How do you know what you are? How do you find the right words to express it? There is an inherent dilemma in whether there is a point in defining myself or 'coming out', nobody will get it, nobody will accept it, I'm filled with this existential dread just thinking about it. Is this gender non-conforming or gender fluidity? 

Sorry for spilling my beans all over the floor, I just don't know how else to convey what's been on my mind. 

If you read this far, you're a champ 🖤",NonBinaryTalk,[TW] First post... Trying to work through a lot of gender confusion... A long ramble,1592563232.0,"{'created_utc': 1592538032, 'id': 'hbte3k', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey there,\n\nBig TW I think... I\'m new to reddit so forgive me if this is misplaced, if I\'ve said or done anything incorrectly please let me know. \n\nTL;DR -  I feel i\'ve always had issues my gender identity and sexuality and how those two interact. These are things I\'ve never fully realised because of my own lack of understanding... Basically this is just a big brain dump. \n\n--\n\nI am 26 AFAB. \n\nGrowing up I was always a big tomboy. I wasn\'t exposed to gender roles, at least I was so aloof that I didn\'t notice. My mum would keep my hair short, so sometimes I\'d rebel by refusing to cut it; I thought it\'d make the other kids at school like me more. I have a lot of memories of roleplaying WWE with my brother and trying to get into fights with boys and getting angry when my brother would defend me.\n\nI started high school, I was sent to an all girl\'s Catholic school and it was rough, there were very clear lines drawn for me. I wasn\'t allowed to use the wood shop because I was female, I couldn\'t access musical instruments because I was female. Just sit down and be quiet like a good wife would, is what I was being told. \n\nI would sit on my bed in the mornings before school and just feel like tearing off my flesh. There was something about that uniform that would just give me this sickening feeling in my stomach. I refused to wear dresses (outside of the uniform), I cut my hair and I started dating girls. I acted like a real king shit at this girls school, let me tell you... Word got around and I started getting picked on by older girls at the school, but whenever they\'d grab me it\'d just make me excited to fight. I used to think it\'d be so much easier it I were a dude, but I thought maybe every woman thinks that to some degree. \n\nAround this time, I met a trans guy through the emo/scene crowd and we became good mates. I was 15 at this point, sometimes I\'d strap my chest with bandages but mostly I just dressed in baggy clothes. I felt because my body wasn\'t \'slim\' enough I couldn\'t keep pulling off the androgynous look.\n\nBeing trans back then wasn\'t really talked about the same way it is now, this was around 2009 in the suburbs, my friend found it easier to tell people they were butch and nobody even spoke about pronouns. We would go out to parties and get really rowdy together, I started asking people to call me by a non-gendered name because I claimed I ""was a man in my past life"", a narrative I later dropped and forgot about. Now the scene/emo crowd was an especially frisky bunch, it was fairly common for teens to be s**ually active. I was flirty and would pursue girls, but I never imagined having s** as the outcome, not with men, not with women. \n\nAfter l was kicked out of Catholic school, I left my town to change schools. I assumed that past me was confused and ignorant. I was a big dumb show-off who had to prove myself to everyone. Girls at this new school laughed at me when they found out I was a virgin, so, I thought it was something I needed to fix. I thought I needed to present myself in a way that was appealing to guys. An arty, cool older guy in the grade above me asked me out so I obligued. Then came my first time and it was uninteresting, uncomfortable and a bit freaky. I didn\'t want to touch or look at either of our genitals, and I spent the whole time staring at the clock. But I didn\'t think about this as a signifier that I wasn\'t as straight or comfortable with femininity as I wanted to believe. I just thought I\'d \'get it\' eventually.\n\nAround this time I shaved my head into a mohawk, and started dressing more and more flamboyant, I didn\'t realise that my expression of sexuality and gender did not need to be considered in a cis hetero context. If I dressed like a woman I felt like I was putting on a costume, that I was proving to someone that I could be attractive if I wanted to be and how dare they tell me otherwise - this was considered fun to me, I never felt wrong dressing up, just amusing like an immitation or an act. I was heavily inspired by Bowie and I regularly performed in these outfits that would combine feminine elements like tights and sequined corsets with cowboy boots and suede jackets.\n\nThen the body issue came back. I hated the soft, rounded body that I\'d grown into, I wanted to be taller, I wanted more bones and less flesh. I didn\'t want breasts. I started dating a guy I felt I had control over, and I began to starve myself and cut myself off from my friends. I lost myself in that relationship and essentially wasted three good years of my early adulthood where I should have spent figuring things out. I became severely underweight but I didn\'t see how bad it was. When I had just started university, a guy in my cohort called me an ugly rat, I felt crushed, I felt like I needed to prove him wrong. I received criticism from teachers for singing in a way that wasn\'t conventional, or not dressing pretty enough for performances. I\'d never felt so upset by what people thought of me and I hid my body. In this stage of my life I met my current partner and immediately left my three year relationship. \n\nFrom age 20 I tried so hard to clean up my act, I took out my piercings, would wear skirts and dresses and kept my hair nice. I thought I could conform to a normal state of being, at one stage outright rejecting everything I said and did as a teen. I felt that rejection extended into my own self expression, the longer I spent ignoring the world the harder it felt to open up. I stopped writing, drawing and listening to music. There was a huge deal of grief and this... hole that I couldn\'t explain and I couldn\'t fill. \n\nWhen my father very suddenly passed in an accident three years ago, I felt like my eyes were bashed open, I used that pain as momentum to make steps towards becoming a stronger human being and I started opening up to my partner and even made a couple friends. I spent years working up the courage to go out again, to be myself. \n\nTwo years ago I shaved my head and this was the first time in years I started expressing my masculine side. I dressed up in a white suit for a work function and it sent everyone into a frenzy. I leaned into the persona, I was being unabashedly flamboyant and flirtatious. I felt confident. But suddenly I was being called a lesbian; despite being in a long-term relationship with a man. It didn\'t feel right. It kinda made me mad. I pushed it aside, but I\'d become hyper aware of how people viewed me, and it wasn\'t delicate or femme, it was as an aggressive, masculine if not eccentric and female. But that\'s not it. \n\nI attended a work dress up party in a skirt last year and my boss expressed surprise and told me he thought I\'d come in a suit again and it\'s cool if I want to *be both*, he said...

I recently found myself in a complicated medical situation. First, some background.

I have a disability called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is a collagen disorder. Collagen holds your joints (and organs) in place, it helps make sure your scarring turns out right, and it helps regulate bruising, among other things. 

Last night, during my weekly self-exam of my, err, internal bits, I noticed a strange bulge. That immediately set off panic alarms, because pelvic organ prolapse is a common complication of my disorder. I confirm my suspicions online, shoot an email to my doctor, and go back to researching so I can know what to expect. Based on the location of the bulge, it's probably my bladder, which is a bit of a problem, but certainly not the worst thing it could be. 

To the meat of the issue: Basically, my bladder has 'fallen' down and is now pressing against my insides. It's cursed as hell, to be honest. Surgery often isn't needed, but without surgery it's a chronic issue. But. The surgery has a higher success rate when a hysto is included. 

Surgery terrifies me. I've wanted a hysto basically since I first learned it could be done, and this would give me a way to get insurance to cover one, at 24 with no kids. But. Surgery in people with EDS has a very, very high rate of complications &amp; failure -- it likely wouldnt even prevent my bladder from falling again next year. It could really mess up and destabilize other organs -- having a hysto puts me at risk of other, worse pelvic organ prolapses.

So, yet again, a transition thing I thought was out of reach is suddenly within grasp, and it's still a bad decision. I have the perfect excuse to get a surgery I so badly want, and still, I can't.

I've been struggling to come out and socially transition, working on it little by little because I'm still in the National Guard for another year and don't want to change over all my social media just yet.

So I've been looking into transition options as an amab enbie, and to be honest I'm kinda confused. 
I'm thinking of starting estrogen at some point in the future, since I want to have a more feminine side of androgynous appearance, however I'm concerned about potential breast growth - not only am I not entirely sure if that's something I want, but it'd be something that would be difficult to hide if it progressed too far before I came out. 
So according to a lot of what I've read, on E there's no real getting around the breast growth part, which is a little annoying. However, I've read that taking micodoses may decrease or at least slow it down, is there any truth to this? Are there any other options for getting a more androgynous appearance?

2020-06-24 08:46:58,hexjxo,0,1,"Hi all buckle up because my mind is a shit tangle of self loathing!!! :D Thanks in advance for any emotional labour expended on me. 

TLDR: my amab partner recently came out to me as nb and I’m struggling with my own identity in relation to our new dynamic. 

This is probably going to be an abstract mess of weird thoughts but I needed to get it out somewhere and hopefully get educated/some feedback from folks who aren’t as deep in their head as me or as close to the situation as my partner. Some background:

I (27 f) am engaged to my partner (29, amab nb, he/him) of 10 years. We share an incredible bond and are truly soul mates. I love him beyond measure. 

I have always known he is not the “typical male.” He is a soft, gentle human who displays many effeminate traits while (previously) presenting primarily as male. He holds very few stereotypical male characteristics and this is part of what attracted me to him. We both came out very early to each other as bisexual and both have always felt validated in that identity by the other throughout our relationship and have explored it a lot together. I have never once felt any discomfort with the idea of being in a queer relationship in the regard, even encouraging him to explore androgyny as I know it’s something he’d like to do. 

Here’s where my “issue” begins:

Around a month ago it was the night before my birthday. We were chilling at home and smoked a lot of weed and the conversation turned to our hopes for the future, with it being my birthday and all. He ended up coming out as non binary and initially (while I was a bit surprised) I was stoked he was living his truth finally! I could tell he didn’t want it to be a big deal and I didn’t make it one. 

The next day was a little harder. It was a Covid birthday and we were just hanging out together at home. It was like a switch had flipped though, and the man I’d loved for ten years decided to wear a dress and do his makeup. He put on a dress I’d intended to wear for him first and I didn’t have the heart to tell him to try something else. He looked beautiful. I feel though like I spent my birthday trying desperately not to treat him as a man. Tiptoeing around and putting myself second. It was confusing for me. Not because I don’t accept him and love him but because it was so different from what I’m used to. I told him it was the best present, to see him being himself and I meant/mean it. It was a bit jarring though and I feel like a dick for being “jarred” in any capacity. 

While very much a part of the queer community, I’m definitely an old fashioned gal. A huge part of our shared interests in our relationship’s early stages (and still) is old films. And he definitely was always a Cary Grant type in this last decade. I loved the old world vibe we had in our relationship (very rooted in binary notions I admit) and the (very socially constructed I also admit) concept of being a woman ”adored” by a man (UGH so cringe I hate the way that sounds). This is a very intimate mental and sexual thing for me which I’ll explain: 

After a two year period of depression that I got out earlier this year (March) I decided to reclaim my ultra. femme side. While I lived in sweats and t shirts those years, I got rid of all that stuff and bought beautiful feminine clothing. I started taking deep pride in my makeup and hair again and began to lean into my femininity and see myself in that way. For the first time in two years, I decided I was going to let myself be adored by a man again (my fiancée). Allow him to be that Cary Grant gentlemanly type to me that he often tried to be, when I previously thought I wasn’t worth it. Allow myself to see myself as a mother one day, and I definitely started bringing a very femme submissive vibe to the bedroom which he loved and still does even in his current expression. 

I guess I mourn the loss of that side of things, or at least the outward expression of them from his side. It was kind of just one night and the man I fell In love with is no longer here. I’m getting to know him in his non binary identity thing. I respect and validate his identity and honestly enjoy seeing him like this.

Occasionally though I get a feeling of discomfort and don’t really know what to do with myself. All this discussion of gender has me in almost a crisis of identity. Continuing to respect myself and my preferences while also not gendering him in a way that would induce dysphoria. Being intentional with how I address him (he said he likes a “peppering” of she/her  every now and then which I’m doing my best with!) while also missing the binary context we used to operate in. Watching him wear my clothes and makeup and ignoring the fact that I loved his masculine clothing and felt more attraction to him that way, at least in a way I understood better. Trying to come to the realization that his femme expression does not minimize my own hard won femme expression.

I got a little depressed today and I just keep shoving these feelings down because I don’t want to be yet another person giving him a hard time about who he is. I just want him to feel loved and accepted.

Some background:\n\nI (27 f) am engaged to my partner (29, amab nb, he/him) of 10 years. We share an incredible bond and are truly soul mates. I love him beyond measure. \n\nI have always known he is not the “typical male.” He is a soft, gentle human who displays many effeminate traits while (previously) presenting primarily as male. He holds very few stereotypical male characteristics and this is part of what attracted me to him. We both came out very early to each other as bisexual and both have always felt validated in that identity by the other throughout our relationship and have explored it a lot together. I have never once felt any discomfort with the idea of being in a queer relationship in the regard, even encouraging him to explore androgyny as I know it’s something he’d like to do. \n\nHere’s where my “issue” begins:\n\nAround a month ago it was the night before my birthday. We were chilling at home and smoked a lot of weed and the conversation turned to our hopes for the future, with it being my birthday and all. He ended up coming out as non binary and initially (while I was a bit surprised) I was stoked he was living his truth finally! I could tell he didn’t want it to be a big deal and I didn’t make it one. \n\nThe next day was a little harder. It was a Covid birthday and we were just hanging out together at home. It was like a switch had flipped though, and the man I’d loved for ten years decided to wear a dress and do his makeup. He put on a dress I’d intended to wear for him first and I didn’t have the heart to tell him to try something else. He looked beautiful. I feel though like I spent my birthday trying desperately not to treat him as a man. Tiptoeing around and putting myself second. It was confusing for me. Not because I don’t accept him and love him but because it was so different from what I’m used to. I told him it was the best present, to see him being himself and I meant/mean it. It was a bit jarring though and I feel like a dick for being “jarred” in any capacity. \n\nWhile very much a part of the queer community, I’m definitely an old fashioned gal. A huge part of our shared interests in our relationship’s early stages (and still) is old films. And he definitely was always a Cary Grant type in this last decade. I loved the old world vibe we had in our relationship (very rooted in binary notions I admit) and the (very socially constructed I also admit) concept of being a woman ”adored” by a man (UGH so cringe I hate the way that sounds). This is a very intimate mental and sexual thing for me which I’ll explain: \n\nAfter a two year period of depression that I got out earlier this year (March) I decided to reclaim my ultra. femme side. While I lived in sweats and t shirts those years, I got rid of all that stuff and bought beautiful feminine clothing. I started taking deep pride in my makeup and hair again and began to lean into my femininity and see myself in that way. For the first time in two years, I decided I was going to let myself be adored by a man again (my fiancée). Allow him to be that Cary Grant gentlemanly type to me that he often tried to be, when I previously thought I wasn’t worth it. Allow myself to see myself as a mother one day, and I definitely started bringing a very femme submissive vibe to the bedroom which he loved and still does even in his current expression. \n\nI guess I mourn the loss of that side of things, or at least the outward expression of them from his side.

This will probably end up mostly sounding like a rant, sorry. I'm looking for some sort of advice on feeling comfortable with myself when I'm treated as an afterthought to my family.

I came out to my parents over dinner a few months ago and they were both accepting. Confused, but said they loved me and wanted me to feel comfortable with them. I was pretty happy it went so well and felt really good!

After a few months of quarantine, my parents still haven't bothered to really use my pronouns except for the occasional time where my mom will catch herself and half-heartedly end a sentence with ""oh, them."" It feels like I can't be frustrated about that because she is technically trying....... But like it doesn't feel like it.

Both my parents continue to call my (accepting) sister and I ""the girlies"" and ""our daughters"" and won't use they/them when talking about me around their friends. Any instance where I try and gently correct them they just kinda roll their eyes.

Last straw was really when my sister and I were on a walk and I asked how our parents are about my gender when I'm not around (I live on my own). She hesitated and said she didn't want to tell me, but when I pushed her for it she said that my pronoun change is definitely treated as nothing but an inconvenience. Feeling really down about it and guilty because technically my family still loves me and is half trying.

tl;dr my parents keep dismissing my identity since coming out and I'm feeling really guilty about feeling sad because they're technically trying sometimes

\--------------------------

I find that sometimes it's easier to try them out with strangers, see how it feels, or start talking with supportive folks for your name and/or pronouns to help it feel good, automatic, and like you. It's a neural pathway that needs to be formed, I've heard various estimates on how long this takes (66 days, 492 times, etc.), so let's start greasing that groove together!

I'm hosting a few Zoom groups meant for social connection of non-binary/GNC/trans folks, with the primary goal of allowing participants to try out or get more accustomed to a new name &amp;/or pronouns.

About the meetings:  
\- Times/dates vary. My time zone is Western US, but I'll try to find times that work for everyone interested, if they vary widely. I'm limiting these to 6 people per group due to the dynamics of group conversation.   
\- I'm doing this for free, so I'm using free Zoom which is limited to 40min per session. I will open a new room at the 40 min mark and we will all switchover. In total each meeting will be 80 min (1 hour 20 min).  
\- You'll need to have access to Zoom.  
\- I prefer that everyone be on camera, but it's not required, as long as your audio is working or you can type in the chat.  
\- I know that some of us may have a few different name options we are deciding between. You can discuss this or your options in the group, but I ask that you please choose only 1 to be identified by for the duration of the meeting. Put it in your Zoom ID name along with your pronouns (I can guide on how to do this if you do not know).  
\- We will do a round of introductions with name and pronouns.  
\- I don't want this to be extremely structured or artificial, but in order to avoid Zoom Silence... I'll have a few prepared questions &amp; conversation topics. Some serious, some fun, some random. I'll post them on screen share. We will go around &amp; each person will choose a question, or create one of their own, &amp; ask it to another person, using their name. Then anyone can comment on their answer, or contribute, being sure to use names and pronouns as much as possible. (E.g. ""Ash, what's your favorite food?"", ""oh my gosh, Riley, I'm having a similar experience."", ""I really resonate with what they were saying about representation &amp; how meaningful that is."")  
\- Please come to the group with an intention to be mindful and supportive of everyone. Use their correct name and pronouns, they will be displayed on screen. Sometimes, even trans and non-binary people can misgender others, so if this happens, catch yourself, apologize, correct yourself, and move on.

Meeting with internet people will always carry some amount of risk. But some steps I'm taking to help with security:  
\- I am not posting this link publicly. I will only communicate date, time, zoom link, and room password in private messages.  
\- After someone messages me expressing interest, I'll vet by reviewing your Reddit history &amp; ask you a few personal questions.  
\- Please be mindful of your personal safety. I know that so many of us are not in living situations that are supportive of this process. You can go do this on your phone in your car, outside, or while on a walk. You can use headphones on your computer inside &amp; no one will hear people referring to you. If you need to duck out unexpectedly or turn off your video, that is ok.

About me:   
I am non-binary. I am queer. I am a student in a master of social work program. I've produced many in vivo events for my local LGBTQIA2S+ community. Although I'm usually behind the scenes, so we'll see how this goes. No, I don't have a post history on this sub. I'm a very active Reddit lurker. I learn most by reading about others experiences and reflecting internally.

2020-06-27 11:39:57,hgs3nj,1,1,"Hi, I am kinda scared to post here because I am not out in real life but I don't want to make a throwaway for one post so here it is.  
A while ago I bought a cheap binder of amazon. Like 12€ maybe. It made my chest look flat and I was so happy. However after a while I noticed how much pain it caused in my chest and shoulders and arms. So I threw that shit out and got a more expensive one from an online shop that sells a lot of trans things. (MtF and FtM) It looked serious and trustworthy. Everything was fine, I got two new binders that were expensive as hell (to me at least because I don't exactly have a lot of money. In fact buying these was a rather bad financial decision but I really wanted a flat chest) Now, these binders don't cause me pain. They feel quite nice to wear however, they don't make me as flat as the cheap, dangerous one did (Yeah, calling it dangerous because I heard that bidners that cause that much pain can damage you). I should also mention that my breasts are small already that's why choosing the right size is a bit hard for me. I'm pretty tall so I generally need L but my chest qualifies for M. I bought L (it's a long binder. It looks a bit like a normal top. Not cropped ir anything).   
There was also an option to get stronger material (would make the order more expensive)  
So now I am wondering:

Does it not make me flate because it's too big around my chest? Because my chest needs size M while the rest of me needs L?

Is it because I didn't get the stronger material?

2020-06-27 17:24:40,hgxjmb,22,11,"I always find language an interesting topic, so I'd like to know: what words, descriptors, titles and other language conventions feel 'right' to describe you vs. what feels wrong, and why do you think that is? Do you prefer only gender-neutral language, or do you not mind certain gendered terms (and hate others)?

As an example, I actually like being called girlfriend (and would love being called wife), but I hate being called a girl or a woman.

I think the personal reason for this is that 1. I'm really not a fan of 'partner' because it sounds sterile to me (this is just for my own use, not speaking for anyone else here) and I'm also not a fan of terms like 'datemate' because they just sound a little silly to me. Meanwhile, 'girlfriend' to me sounds really cute, and 'wife' sounds comfy and domestic, and I value those things for myself.

So I've been thinking about this a lot recently... I've realized I tie my worth/value to how desirable cishet men find me. And on top of that, one of the things that has held me back from presenting more masc is worrying about how the cishet men I've been with in the past will react.

I worry about no one loving me if cishet men don't accept me for who I really am.

The logical side of my brain realizes this is BS, and my identity and expression is more important than than cishet men not approving, but I still can't stop from feeling/thinking about this. I think it is internalized transphobia and misogyny. It seems like the cishet white male gaze is what AFABs ""should"" be striving for--instead of doing what WE feel is right for ourselves.
