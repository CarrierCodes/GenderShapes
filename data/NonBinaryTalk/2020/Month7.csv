I told him it didn’t matter to which he responded, well do they look more like a girl or a guy? I told him that was rude to ask but before I could try to explain to him he cut me off and we got into a fight. 

My dad is in his 60s and pretty close-minded when it comes to anything LGBTQ+ and he’s live in Southern USA (more conservative) so he doesn’t know many LGBTQ+ people. 

Any tips for how I can try to explain why NB might not want to be described by their physical traits and by their character instead? Or am I just being too worked up about asking if a mutual friend looks more feminine or masculine

One of the reasons I came to the realization I’m NB, is that when I tried out binding with a compression bra, and hiding my hair in a beanie, I felt euphoric.

The problem is that that gender euphoria caused me to see how much I was dissatisfied with my appearance and prior gender presentation.

I got rid of the clothes that made me uncomfortable, and was given some of my dad’s old clothes. I feel crazy because I feel like these things didn’t bug me nearly as much before.

Disclaimer I tend to use multiple dots when I feel insecure, and I know it bugs some people. I also talk about some mental issues, body image issues and so on.


So I was born female. Then through some trauma I developed something called OSDD, which is like DID (aka it’s previous name was MPD, both are trauma disorders, and both have alters. Alters are different people who exist in one mind. Not shattered parts of one, as this was done before personality forms.) anyways the systems alters have different genders. Some are females, some are males, there is one who is an inhuman Id say between hermaphroditism and non gendered? It’s difficult to pin down. We shift around, but I myself usually stay front, kinda sharing with everyone else. So depending on who is out and how strongly I get a mixture of how they feel, and what they are (it’s called passive influence.) including disgust for meat when our vegan is forward, a compulsion to kiss my husband, and gender issues if one of the non females start coming forward. 

Dru in particular has some weird feelings about my breasts. He is straight, and loves them! But if he thinks about them on the same body he’s in it make him feel funny. He also wants to wear classy masculine clothes. Button ups, and ties, with jeans. He has this whole image. I wish I could accommodated it. On my tight budget, but finding shirts that fit like that is atrocious! (For context, even our females are self conscious about the size of our bust. Tiny frame, and I have to buy custom bras or specialty bras since my band usually isn’t in the higher cups. The fact stores don’t have anything to fit the body makes us feel like a freak of nature. Most of the time we wear a $60 sports bra, that doesn’t help much with size, or bra less because we can’t afford the standard bras. Makes the females feel bad because they want cute lingerie.)

Mavis on the other hand is what we would call our hyper feminine. Lolita, pastels, rainbows, glitter, and the works, and I want to express that as well.

Anyways we all know people who criticize trans and non-binary tend to say everyone has mental issues. Which I honestly don’t understand why that opens up room for their opinion on the matter anyways.. but I don’t want to come in and mess something up for you guys, or not actually mesh in properly. I have a bit of fear I guess I wont be accepted... and We/I wont be seen as real/valid. But seriously so what if someone isn’t the gender assigned because of trauma?

And even then I was way more middle of the road with my gender presentation. My sexuality was never a big deal so I don’t see why my gender has to be. 

I’ve officially started using they/them pronouns professionally (because of email signatures or if I list my pronouns in a bio) but that means that there are some people who still refer to me with my old pronouns...and honestly it doesn’t bother me. It doesn’t hurt my feelings and it doesn’t change who I am now, if I ever see them in person sure, I’ll totally tell them, but if me telling them now means writing a Facebook post or messaging them individually then forget it.

2020-07-06 20:02:56,hmfbmb,24,7,"I’m nonbinary. Growing up I was a massive Harry Potter fan! My wedding which was scheduled for October 12, 2020 but has to be rescheduled for October 2021, is even Harry Potter themed! My fiancée and I have all the books, all of the movies, and a plethora of decor! With the wedding originally scheduled for October 2020,we have also invested in decorations for the wedding. I won’t go into details; the point simply is, jk Rowling’s tweets, and recently her relentlessness posting them immensely frequently, hurts me.

I am having trouble exposing to cis people why this hurts so much. A lot of trans friends of mine have been posting about how we need to not support her anymore, how we need to “let her go.” I want to separate the art from the artist, and I remind myself not EVERYTHING we have, i.e. decor from independent artists, even contributes to her astronomical, disgust wealth. But the more she posts and the more I look at things after that, the more it hurts.

Cis people get mad if you can’t separate the art from the artist. Cis folks get mad about how you are ruining their child and taking away something they love. Ironically, this is exactly how so many of us trans folks feel. I think that cis people just at the absolute center don’t hurt as much because it’s not them being targeted and plain and simply don’t truly get what a ruined childhood, a destruction of a former source of happiness, a loss of a former escape, an active attack from a former role model, feel like.

I wasn’t going to say this, I was going to keep it as a general, but in particular, I am scared and avoiding this convo with my partner. A while back, after other tweets, I felt that she felt angry in the sense above.

Growing up I was a massive Harry Potter fan! My wedding which was scheduled for October 12, 2020 but has to be rescheduled for October 2021, is even Harry Potter themed! My fiancée and I have all the books, all of the movies, and a plethora of decor! With the wedding originally scheduled for October 2020,we have also invested in decorations for the wedding. I won’t go into details; the point simply is, jk Rowling’s tweets, and recently her relentlessness posting them immensely frequently, hurts me.\n\nI am having trouble exposing to cis people why this hurts so much. A lot of trans friends of mine have been posting about how we need to not support her anymore, how we need to “let her go.” I want to separate the art from the artist, and I remind myself not EVERYTHING we have, i.e. decor from independent artists, even contributes to her astronomical, disgust wealth. But the more she posts and the more I look at things after that, the more it hurts.\n\nCis people get mad if you can’t separate the art from the artist. Cis folks get mad about how you are ruining their child and taking away something they love. Ironically, this is exactly how so many of us trans folks feel. I think that cis people just at the absolute center don’t hurt as much because it’s not them being targeted and plain and simply don’t truly get what a ruined childhood, a destruction of a former source of happiness, a loss of a former escape, an active attack from a former role model, feel like.\n\nI wasn’t going to say this, I was going to keep it as a general, but in particular, I am scared and avoiding this convo with my partner.

2020-07-08 18:33:27,hnmkrd,3,3,"I have been getting a bunch of self doubt lately after coming out. There are huge moments of my life where I couldn’t understand why I felt uncomfortable in my body because it felt different than regular self doubt/hate. I know there’s been similar topics on here so I’ll be brief. 

Many small moments lined up with being NB when I was a kid - not knowing my sexuality because I felt like I didn’t feel like a “girl” so I couldn’t find a label that fit ME, being uncomfortable for a really long time for being seen as “girly” or high femme, not knowing why I hated terms like queen/girlie/etc. It always felt like it was pushed on me and like I didn’t have a choice. 

I ended up growing up to be more comfortable in high femme attire but I still somewhat felt out of place when people would use highly gendered language towards me. I also just never got along with women in general because I didn’t feel like I could fit comfortably in that community - like I could fit a foot in but nothing else. I hated being lumped in solely based on how I looked because on the inside I didn’t feel the same way. 

Idk. I guess what I’m trying to say is that it never felt like a huge revelation or anything. It just seemed like a simple truth that I knew all along that didn’t make much of a difference in daily life but made so much SENSE. Now I feel a little out of place in the NB community because at first glance I line up with a more “cis” lifestyle. I guess I’m just confused and I’m actually wondering if I have a place in the community or not. I get excited when people refer to me in a gender neutral way and I cried when I said my name and pronoun preference together for the first time but now I guess I’m feeling lost.

There are huge moments of my life where I couldn’t understand why I felt uncomfortable in my body because it felt different than regular self doubt/hate. I know there’s been similar topics on here so I’ll be brief. \n\nMany small moments lined up with being NB when I was a kid - not knowing my sexuality because I felt like I didn’t feel like a “girl” so I couldn’t find a label that fit ME, being uncomfortable for a really long time for being seen as “girly” or high femme, not knowing why I hated terms like queen/girlie/etc. It always felt like it was pushed on me and like I didn’t have a choice. \n\nI ended up growing up to be more comfortable in high femme attire but I still somewhat felt out of place when people would use highly gendered language towards me. I also just never got along with women in general because I didn’t feel like I could fit comfortably in that community - like I could fit a foot in but nothing else. I hated being lumped in solely based on how I looked because on the inside I didn’t feel the same way. \n\nIdk. I guess what I’m trying to say is that it never felt like a huge revelation or anything. It just seemed like a simple truth that I knew all along that didn’t make much of a difference in daily life but made so much SENSE. Now I feel a little out of place in the NB community because at first glance I line up with a more “cis” lifestyle. I guess I’m just confused and I’m actually wondering if I have a place in the community or not. I get excited when people refer to me in a gender neutral way and I cried when I said my name and pronoun preference together for the first time but now I guess I’m feeling lost. \n\nIs this normal?

2020-07-13 18:34:15,hqkww1,4,1,"TW: Possible misgendering, although it's in Spanish, which is a heavily gendered language

I've been out for a few weeks now. I can't remember exactly how long, quarantine has a way of screwing with time. I've talked to both my wife and my sister about how I feel about my own gender (NB/AMAB), how I don't feel like ""man"" or ""woman"" are appropriate labels for me. They already knew, for the most part. I'm not exactly silent about my thoughts on gender as a social construct. For years I've been saying that there are multiple ways to be a man or a woman, how it's fine if you are a man who enjoys feminine things and vice versa.

I went to a family reunion years ago where I tried to help out in the kitchen and was refused. My Lita kept telling me, ""No mijo, sientate, it's okay"" and at the time, I thought it was just Lita being Lita, refusing help even though she's in her nineties. My Aunt and my Dad would later tell me that it was because, in our family, ""Men don't belong in the kitchen."" My Aunt, who I lived with at the time, tried to sympathize and told me that the rule was stupid, but that's just how our family is. I remember finding this answer unsatisfactory.

Being in quarantine has shown me that my family is far from the only one like it. The news and social media and internet personalities have shown me how hostile to non-conformity our world is. Even more disheartening is that some of the loudest voices are people that I would think would be allies (I won't invoke them here, but I think you've heard from these folks). I'd heard it all before, but somehow it didn't seem so loud as it now is, and I have a hard time saying if it's because the world is very volatile right now, or because I never questioned it before.

My wife and I have been talking about when I'm going to come out, and it only terrifies me. I don't want my identity to be some event that everyone makes a big deal out of, I'm not a big deal. I just want to live as myself and be comfortable in my own validity. Coming out (to me, I emphasize) feels like asking permission. ""Here I am! Whaddaya think?"" And I don't really care what they think.

I came out to my wife because I needed to talk to someone I knew about it, because I think that our marriage is an important bond (to me), and implicit in that bond is being truthful to each other.

I came out to my sister as a coming out ""trial run"". My sister is pan, and has already had a moment of coming out to others. And aside from feeling a little closer to my sister, which don't get me wrong I love and appreciate, I didn't really feel any more valid. I'm still just as enby as I was before.

I don't think I'm going to come out, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be closeted. I'm still going to dress how I like, do things I enjoy doing, express myself in a way that feels authentic to me. For me that means skinny jeans, nail polish, fabulous kicky boots, long hair, and brightly-colored flannel shirts that I can tuck in (I'm thinking of calling this style ""Letterkenny Queer""). I am going to be who I am because I realized I have the power to grant my own validity. Who I am does not require anyone's permission or even their acknowledgement.

I realize that I am in a very privileged position when it comes to this. I already live away from home, several states away, in fact. Materially, my life is not made any better or worse by coming out to my family. I even know that many younger queer folk want to be out because being closeted is unbearable. Life is ticking away and every day spent not as yourself is an eternity that you will never get back, and those memories of being miserable stay with you like awful photos that keep coming back no matter how many times you burn them.

So why make a post at all?

If my point is that I don't want a big event, that I don't care what others think, why go out of my way to talk about it in a public forum?

Because I get the feeling that I'm not the only person who feels this way. So many people in the trans community at large have spoken about their feelings of not belonging in the LGBTQ+ community, and impostor syndrome is perhaps the worst thing for feeling valid.

As much as I hate being the center of attention in real life, I wish I had had someone when I was younger to tell me that these thoughts are normal, and that I'm not sub-normal for having them. I want to be the person I needed when I was younger, and even if only one person takes something positive away from this, it will have been enough for me.",NonBinaryTalk,"[TW] Family, Validity, and Why I Don't Think I'm Going to Come Out (A Rant)",1594690455.0,"{'created_utc': 1594665255, 'id': 'hqkww1', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'TW: Possible misgendering, although it\'s in Spanish, which is a heavily gendered language\n\nI\'ve been out for a few weeks now. I can\'t remember exactly how long, quarantine has a way of screwing with time. I\'ve talked to both my wife and my sister about how I feel about my own gender (NB/AMAB), how I don\'t feel like ""man"" or ""woman"" are appropriate labels for me. They already knew, for the most part. I\'m not exactly silent about my thoughts on gender as a social construct. For years I\'ve been saying that there are multiple ways to be a man or a woman, how it\'s fine if you are a man who enjoys feminine things and vice versa.\n\nI went to a family reunion years ago where I tried to help out in the kitchen and was refused. My Lita kept telling me, ""No mijo, sientate, it\'s okay"" and at the time, I thought it was just Lita being Lita, refusing help even though she\'s in her nineties. My Aunt and my Dad would later tell me that it was because, in our family, ""Men don\'t belong in the kitchen."" My Aunt, who I lived with at the time, tried to sympathize and told me that the rule was stupid, but that\'s just how our family is. I remember finding this answer unsatisfactory.\n\nBeing in quarantine has shown me that my family is far from the only one like it. The news and social media and internet personalities have shown me how hostile to non-conformity our world is. Even more disheartening is that some of the loudest voices are people that I would think would be allies (I won\'t invoke them here, but I think you\'ve heard from these folks). I\'d heard it all before, but somehow it didn\'t seem so loud as it now is, and I have a hard time saying if it\'s because the world is very volatile right now, or because I never questioned it before.\n\nMy wife and I have been talking about when I\'m going to come out, and it only terrifies me. I don\'t want my identity to be some event that everyone makes a big deal out of, I\'m not a big deal. I just want to live as myself and be comfortable in my own validity. Coming out (to me, I emphasize) feels like asking permission. ""Here I am! Whaddaya think?""

I’ve been very frustrated with my chest because I’ve gone from a D to a DDD already and got up to H with my other two pregnancies. I’m not binding because my chest is too sensitive. My style is very grunge on my more femme days and fuckboi on my masc days and dad-on-vacation when IDGAF. 

I’ve never dealt with not being able to present the way I wanted because I recognized myself as an adult. But now my body feels like it’s taking that choice away from me. My hips get curvier, my chest gets bigger, my face gets plumper. Don’t get me wrong, I love being pregnant. I love feeling and the connection. 

However I can’t find gender affirming pregnancy clothes. I’ve been brainstorming patterns (as I see) and there is nothing easy to modify, so I’d really be building from scratch. I’m just not sure what I can do to feel “affirmed enough.” I’m nervous about feeling dysmorphia again and don’t want it to detract from how much I enjoy pregnancy.

I guess my questions:

1. What self-care can help me feel more affirmed?

2. Has anyone found clothes to wear through pregnancy that have a more masculine feel/look but still offer the support of pregnancy clothes?

3. Any thoughts? Personal experiences?

4. Would finding a therapist be silly? I honestly feel silly wanting to call a therapist over a choice I made.

And then I recently watched a video by an AMAB non-binary person and he explained his experience and story and it all kind of clicked into place. He mentioned liking feminine things as a kid but feeling the need to hide it. Then I remembered that I was really into Pony Club and the Babysitters Club when I was younger.

I said I felt similarly in that I don’t know what female feels like. But I don’t want to take nb as my term  if all “women” feel this way.

I’m going to say something that sounds braggy. Forgive me. You know how some people’s baby pictures look EXACTLY like them as an adult, but I am the opposite.

I was an average looking kid. I was weird and autistic and very introverted and had few friends. In some ways between school and family I was attention starved. 

I remember getting my braces off at 13. I got them on at 11, and about exactly two years had passed. I looked like a different person. A whole different person. Awkward goofy asymmetrical 11 year old. To super attractive, gorgeous 13 year old. I went from a 5 to a 9, and I’m only saying it because many people told me and I know it to be true. I’m 24 now and get compliments every time I go out.

I feel so disconnected from myself and my body and face. I am incredibly uncomfortable every time I am called beautiful, pretty, gorgeous, sexy. I just feel it’s wrong for me and I have always been majorly uncomfortable with it. I don’t want to be handsome though, and I don’t like to look like a “man” or society’s  interpretation of one. Attractive does feel better. 

I do remember a couple times as an early teen looking in the mirror and having a legitimate panic attack because I am somehow so different physically than emotionally or mentally.

I just hate being reminded. I can accept it but I can’t hear it from others. When I am pumping gas and a man in a car pulls up I think every time *please don’t say anything. Please don’t stare.*

Because of this I have a total aesthetic. Facial piercings and tattoos and jewelry and clothes that are my own. Compliment me on my septum jewelry or arm tattoos, not my face or ass. It expresses me better than my cleavage or eye color.

I tried describing it to an ex boyfriend except it’s so hard to describe. He called me beautiful and I lost it, total ugly tears and contorted face crying. I can’t describe how it feels very well in spoken word. He knew I identified as non binary at the time but I don’t think the dysphoria portion clicked for either of us.

I took a semi not terrible gender quiz on the internet. The four options on the graph were masculine, feminine, androgynous (which is what was encouraged for some reason) and *undifferentiated*. I was deeeeeep into the last category, leaning slightly masculine. 

I don’t mind my breasts or ass or the fact I have “female” parts but I’m realizing I have dysphoria. 

I feel very... genderless. Then again I don’t know what a woman should feel like. I don’t want to call myself nb if I am just a woman who doesn’t think about my gender. My roommate is AFAB nb learning masc and is going on T next month. I dont want facial hair or a deep voice or top surgery but I’d pretty much like to get rid of my uterus and do my own thing.

I've been reading a lot of threads about writing enby characters, but I still have some questions-- I want to make sure I do this right. (I'm a bisexual woman, and misrepresentation of bisexuals in fiction drives me INSANE, and I know can perpetuate harm. I never want to do that to any other group of people). 

I'm writing a novel where the main character is a bisexual girl, and she likes a non-binary person named Matt. Matt feels comfortable with both he/him and they/them pronouns. Any advice on how to refer to Matt in dialogue? I worry that if I alway write ""he got to the track early that day"", ""Kari thought his laugh was infectious"", etc, it will be erasing part of Matt's identity. Because Matt does not feel he/him fully encompasses all of who they are. **BUT**, if I write all the dialogue as ""They got to the track early"", ""Kari thought their laugh was infectious"", I'm ignoring the fact that Matt also feels he/him pronouns fit sometimes. **BUT** if I switch constantly between using he/him and they/them, I feel like that's also unrealistic? (I obviously could be wrong. The only non-binary people I know use they/them all the time, but I understand people can use any mix of pronouns). 

One thought I had was to have Matt's best friend use they/them more frequently, and Matt's love interest use he/him more frequently. But then I worry readers are going to think, ""ohhh this is a love story between a girl and a boy, and Matt is *really* a boy, and I can ignore all this ""non-binary"" stuff"". And that is the LAST thing I want to happen. 

 (I also feel it's important to note, Matt's story and character arc isn't centered around them being non-binary. That is a part of their identity, but not a focal point.)

2020-07-23 20:55:26,hwnx68,14,59,"I know very well that NB is a spectrum and incorporates a range of identities, and that folks can identify however they please. But I have a lot of trouble finding folks who feel the way I do. I'm AFAB and on T. I love the physical effects of T. I don't particularly want to look androgynous. I already look androgynous-to-masc. It's not that I don't enjoy confusing people, because I love it. But at my core I've always been masc, not middle-of-spectrum. I kept insisting I was a boy as a kid, but trans kids weren't on anyone's radar in the early 90s. I lived ""happily"" as a lesbian for like 15 years. I wasn't really aware of any gender trouble; it's something that kind of crept up on me in my later 20s when I started presenting more masc (as I'd always wanted to do), and nothing seemed to be masculine enough. I developed a fierce envy of cis men's bodies. I've always been a bit repressed; I mean, as a kid, I almost obsessively drew bearded men. But I've always loved queer women and lesbian culture, always felt that it was my home, spiritually. I have THE FEELINGS. I will never identify as straight, even if I end up a male-passing person primarily attracted to women/AFAB people.

I identify with trans men in many ways: I have a ton of physical dysphoria (social dysphoria is really secondary), I love having more T in me, I basically want to be a big hairy strong dude. I want to feel a rumble in my throat and stubble on my cheeks. I don't want to be a sleek boy or a waifish faun. But I don't want to jettison the positive experiences I had as a woman and my past identities. I don't have bottom dysphoria in the way a lot of trans dudes do; I don't want a dick and balls, I'm happy with the T growth. I'm trying to come to terms with my boobs, because I enjoy them sex-wise enough to not want to take the risk of losing sensation, despite them always kind of feeling like weird growths (many trans men would say the loss is worth it to them; I don't think it would be for me). I don't want to date or attract straight women - like, I cannot emphasize how much I do not want that. I'd have very little in common with a straight woman. My attraction to AFAB folks will always feel queer and I'll always feel an intimate kinship with them in a way straight trans dudes just don't seem to. I'm not interested in dating cis men, and I feel like I wouldn't have much in common with them either. I don't fuck like a dude, I don't think, and I don't want to. My sexuality is a bit more.... assertive on T, but it's bringing out something that's always been there rather than making something new. Almost everything on the ftm men sub is very distant from my experience.

I feel like so many trans men end up with cis men, or end up wanting to fit into gay male culture. I don't relate. I don't want that for my life. I don't grok all the borderline worship of cis men in some quarters of trans male culture, and I have trouble finding trans men who love and lust in the ways I do. 

So, naturally, I identify with NB AFAB people in many ways: I don't think of myself as being a ""man"" in the way cishet society conceptualizes manhood. I'm happy enough being read as one, but it's also not right. But, as I've said, I don't particularly desire androgyny. I don't want low dose T or only subtle effects/some effects. I'm here for it all (short of balding, maybe, but that's a different issue - most cis men don't want that either!). I don't have a particularly queer aesthetic as a dude, because the only way I know how to look queer is as a woman. Maybe I'm read as gay, I don't know (I care about my appearance more than your average cishet dudebro, I'm a bit fussy and faggy), but not to the extent that I get that homophobic glare I know so well from being a dyke. My partner is NB AFAB, doesn't want to be or be perceived as a man, hates body hair, looks very visibly queer (piercings, tattoos, dyed hair). I am, and look like, a dweeby academic. As I change more with T I'll probably just look like every other dude, and I don't know how to feel about it. Binary trans dudes would welcome it, I suspect. I don't want to blend in, it hurts me a little to think about it, but simultaneously, my social anxiety and decades of being a gender problem lead me to just want to be treated as a human rather than a gender sometimes, and apparently the only way to do that is to be perceived as a white cishet man.

Being on T, and feeling euphoric over shit like a couple of dark hairs on my wrist or the rapid development of an embarrassing teen-stache, has \*maybe\* crystallized things a little, but I don't know if people know what I mean when I say NB, or even take it very seriously, when I want physical masculinization so badly, and when the prospect of just living as a man in the eyes of cishet people (and having another identity with loved ones) seems increasingly appealing. I guess I'm ""socially NB"". I angst over being, or wanting to be, ""too much of a dude"" all the time. I feel guilty because I suspect I like he/him better than they/them. I feel guilty for ""not being strong enough"" to just aggressively and openly fuck with gender my whole life. I feel like I'm shamefully retreating into white privilege. But I also feel...... more like myself.

Covid, economic depression, and the climate apocalypse also makes this all seem otiose at times. It's definitely made me feel more laissez faire about just identifying as a trans guy (I've recently found myself surprised to be calling myself that). I'm unemployed now and I know I'd do better if employers just thought I was a cis man than if they perceived me as a butch dyke (that \*look\*, I am so used to it), so sometimes I find myself wishing for ""passing"" as almost a survival mechanism. I just sometimes also feel like there's no way to do gender in any society without some kind of grief or loss.",NonBinaryTalk,"Anyone else feel ""too binary"" to be NB and ""not binary enough"" to be binary?

Maybe I\'m read as gay, I don\'t know (I care about my appearance more than your average cishet dudebro, I\'m a bit fussy and faggy), but not to the extent that I get that homophobic glare I know so well from being a dyke. My partner is NB AFAB, doesn\'t want to be or be perceived as a man, hates body hair, looks very visibly queer (piercings, tattoos, dyed hair). I am, and look like, a dweeby academic. As I change more with T I\'ll probably just look like every other dude, and I don\'t know how to feel about it. Binary trans dudes would welcome it, I suspect. I don\'t want to blend in, it hurts me a little to think about it, but simultaneously, my social anxiety and decades of being a gender problem lead me to just want to be treated as a human rather than a gender sometimes, and apparently the only way to do that is to be perceived as a white cishet man.\n\nBeing on T, and feeling euphoric over shit like a couple of dark hairs on my wrist or the rapid development of an embarrassing teen-stache, has \\*maybe\\* crystallized things a little, but I don\'t know if people know what I mean when I say NB, or even take it very seriously, when I want physical masculinization so badly, and when the prospect of just living as a man in the eyes of cishet people (and having another identity with loved ones) seems increasingly appealing. I guess I\'m ""socially NB"". I angst over being, or wanting to be, ""too much of a dude"" all the time. I feel guilty because I suspect I like he/him better than they/them. I feel guilty for ""not being strong enough"" to just aggressively and openly fuck with gender my whole life. I feel like I\'m shamefully retreating into white privilege. But I also feel...... more like myself.\n\nCovid, economic depression, and the climate apocalypse also makes this all seem otiose at times. It\'s definitely made me feel more laissez faire about just identifying as a trans guy (I\'ve recently found myself surprised to be calling myself that). I\'m unemployed now and I know I\'d do better if employers just thought I was a cis man than if they perceived me as a butch dyke (that \\*look\\*, I am so used to it), so sometimes I find myself wishing for ""passing"" as almost a survival mechanism. I just sometimes also feel like there\'s no way to do gender in any society without some kind of grief or loss.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Anyone else feel ""too binary"" to be NB and ""not binary enough"" to be binary?

5 years ago, I came out as an ftm to my sister, then my mom. My sister took it well, but never brought it up again. My mother sent me to a sexologue who didn’t believe in asexuality and was always saying I can’t wear close I’m comfortable in, but clothes that fits my type of body (ie. thigh clothes) and that I need to dress accordingly of what people will think of me. After a year, my mental health has decreased, I had relapse into anorexia and really, was a mess. I told my mom I wanted to stop the appointments and she asked me if I was still confused in my head. I lied and said “no I’m a girl”.

Also, for my mom, it was either cis or trans. If you are trans, you want all surgery. No in-between.

I am now almost 22. Still living with my parents until I graduate from University. I have a rocky relationship with her. Like.. she’s nice, but I’m also suspecting she might be a little narcissist?

But yeah so months ago, I got back in contact with a nb ftm friend who really help me. He introduced me to a youth club for lgbt+ youth. The intervenant are all really sweet and one really helped me. Now, I have an appointment for my T in the 7 of august and I’m really happy.

But also so much stressed and sometimes, scared.

I often feel like a fraud, that I just making this up. It was easier when I thought I was ftm. Binary. I hate being in between. Feeling like a boy, but not at 100% and not feeling like a girl at all. I hate that.

See I recently have been educating myself on nonbinary identities and such because some of my closest friends have come out to me as either trans or other nonbinary identities and I don't want to make them uncomfortable in any way. So while I was researching about what nonbinary was and the different identities there were I found bigender.

I'm afab and I think I might be bigender.

But now I'm just questioning whether or not I'm faking and just pretending to be bigender because so many of my friends are nonbinary and trans and I just subconsciously want to fit in more with them.

-she her pronouns don’t bother me
-he him pronouns don’t bother me
-they them pronouns don’t bother me
-could I be NB?
-gender is sups confusing 
-“i mean I’m just me” me
-NB seems closer to who I am ig? Maybe?
-titties are annoying
-some days I don’t want them
-binder could be interesting to invest in 
-I pretty much only wear sports bras anyways
-I like being super fem. 
-I don’t really know how to be masculine tho? And I’d like to be?
—muscle t’s??
-just be Harry styles
-cis by convenience?(I read this somewhere and well? I dunno) 
-was internalised misogyny just that?
-gender roles suck! Blegh 
-body hair is cool 😎 
-nonconformity? Is that my thing with gender roles?
-am I enby or do I just not like conforming you’re gender roles?

I remember also being told that wjen my mom was pregnant they told her I was going to be a boy and had it was only during delivery that they found out I was a baby girl, and I would always ask why couldn't I have kept that boy baby name they had chosen?

During my teen years, I would dress in baggy clothes and usually be mistaken for a boy. I didn't really mind.

I used to dream a lot about having a penis, but also conserving all my lady bits. When Ranma 1/2 was around, I wanted that for myself, able to change between genders easily and freely. 

I guess mainly what bothers me are the gender roles. I always say I wanted to be a parent, but a father instead of a mother. It's more on the side of being against at ""women do this, men do that"". But is it only that?

I feel like  people calling me the incorrect pronouns/gender descriptors bothers me somedays more than others. For example, one day, my parents called me young lady (I'm afab) and it irked me so much that I felt nauseous. Another time, my parents referred to me as a young woman, but it didnt bother me as much. I didnt like it, I dont feel like it is an accurate way to describe me, but for some reason I just could ignore it more. 

I think that sometimes, I'm better at ignoring how I feel so I dont have to explain myself or complicate things for others. I'm still questioning so I dont want to make a big deal out of this just in case I'm wrong.
