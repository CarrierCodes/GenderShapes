2020-02-02 16:53:37,exr8qv,2,1,"Hey so I (26, AMAB) am a bit scared right now.
Last night my parents had dinner with my aunt into whom I ran last fall, at the market, in my yellow skirt. Now she went and told my parents, and my dad ""confronts me"" about it over text message with just the words ""Yellow skirt."". I reply ""yeah ... any comments ? "" and then an eyeroll emoji. (I realise this might have been a tad defensive and passive-aggressive, but I'm really sick of them passing comments on just my pink hairdye, so I was kinda bracing myself)

He replied that he apparently isn't entitled to any, I say he can say whatever he likes, but I kinda can guess what he'll say and I'm not interested in that. But he sucks at text messages so he evntually calls me. (he wasn't overtly antagonistic)

Over the phone he's clearly walking on eggshells. It's obvious he's uncomfortable with the notion that I dress feminine. He's saying stuff like ""your aunt thinks you're deviant"". Initially it shocked me but my dad doesn't understand how words really work so I'm thinking he didn't intend it to be hurtful and he doesn't get the upsetting undertones. My aunt hereslf aparently never said ""deviant"", it's just how he interprets what she said, and I think to him ""deviant"" just means ""deviating from the social norm"" -- which isn't alltogether incorrect.

Anyways, then he started rambling on a bit about how I must be aware of what I'm doing, that people will see me a certain way. He said some people might think I'm ""excentric"". He also went on his favourite of all tangents, about how I should concentrate on finishing my Ph D, and he's worried I'm getting distracted. All in all he's doing the ages-old ""oh I'm not upset I'm just worried for you"" shtick that a lot of upset parents of ""deviant children"" seem to do. He also told me my mum was upste to learn it from my aunt and not me.

My mum said she thinks there's ""evidently something going on in my head"" -- again not alltogether incorrect. She called my feminine attire ""an extravagance"". I told her that I hadn't told them about it because of how they reacted to the hair.

Also I'm glad my aunt taddled. I feel like a bit of a coward, but at leadt that way my parents can't possibly think I'm doing this to upset them or that I'm insincere -- if I dress like that to go to the fucking supermarket by myself... And indeed, they seem to be taking it seriously, unlike my hair, which they thought I was doing just for a laugh.

But my mum said we need to talk about this and now I'm a little scared. That dinner will be super awkward, won't it?

So I kinda needed to vent but I'm also fishing for advice : should I invite my best friend to this dinner? Would it help or might it make my parents averse to bringing the topic up at all ?

Should I actually wear my feminine clothes or would that further upset them ? For now it seems like they're clearly uncomfortable with it but also like they're trying their best to not hurt me.

Now she went and told my parents, and my dad ""confronts me"" about it over text message with just the words ""Yellow skirt."". I reply ""yeah ... any comments ? "" and then an eyeroll emoji. (I realise this might have been a tad defensive and passive-aggressive, but I\'m really sick of them passing comments on just my pink hairdye, so I was kinda bracing myself)\n\nHe replied that he apparently isn\'t entitled to any, I say he can say whatever he likes, but I kinda can guess what he\'ll say and I\'m not interested in that. But he sucks at text messages so he evntually calls me. (he wasn\'t overtly antagonistic)\n\nOver the phone he\'s clearly walking on eggshells. It\'s obvious he\'s uncomfortable with the notion that I dress feminine. He\'s saying stuff like ""your aunt thinks you\'re deviant"". Initially it shocked me but my dad doesn\'t understand how words really work so I\'m thinking he didn\'t intend it to be hurtful and he doesn\'t get the upsetting undertones. My aunt hereslf aparently never said ""deviant"", it\'s just how he interprets what she said, and I think to him ""deviant"" just means ""deviating from the social norm"" -- which isn\'t alltogether incorrect.\n\nAnyways, then he started rambling on a bit about how I must be aware of what I\'m doing, that people will see me a certain way. He said some people might think I\'m ""excentric"". He also went on his favourite of all tangents, about how I should concentrate on finishing my Ph D, and he\'s worried I\'m getting distracted. All in all he\'s doing the ages-old ""oh I\'m not upset I\'m just worried for you"" shtick that a lot of upset parents of ""deviant children"" seem to do. He also told me my mum was upste to learn it from my aunt and not me.\n\nMy mum said she thinks there\'s ""evidently something going on in my head"" -- again not alltogether incorrect. She called my feminine attire ""an extravagance"". I told her that I hadn\'t told them about it because of how they reacted to the hair.\n\nAlso I\'m glad my aunt taddled. I feel like a bit of a coward, but at leadt that way my parents can\'t possibly think I\'m doing this to upset them or that I\'m insincere -- if I dress like that to go to the fucking supermarket by myself... And indeed, they seem to be taking it seriously, unlike my hair, which they thought I was doing just for a laugh.\n\nBut my mum said we need to talk about this and now I\'m a little scared. That dinner will be super awkward, won\'t it?\n\nSo I kinda needed to vent but I\'m also fishing for advice : should I invite my best friend to this dinner? Would it help or might it make my parents averse to bringing the topic up at all ?\n\nShould I actually wear my feminine clothes or would that further upset them ? For now it seems like they\'re clearly uncomfortable with it but also like they\'re trying their best to not hurt me.

best friend is biologically female, but feels uncomfortable with both he/him she/her pronouns so they've asked that the they/them pronouns be used for them.

they've dated this trans ftm guy for a while and decided to come out to him as non binary and tell him what are their correct pronouns.

he completely disregarded this, said non binary doesn't exist, that because they don't have an official diagnosis of gender dysphoria they're a 'trender' (that means someone faking/pretending to be something for attention and popularity). 

he continued to mispronounce them, using the she/her pronouns, even though that made them feel uncomfortable and wrong.

he said how it was causing a problem for him, because his other trans friends were looking down on him for dating my best friend, said no one wants them in the community etc.

they broke up with him because of this as well as other reasons i wont talk about.

he continued to harass them and kept saying how:

Non Binary is the same as Trans.

and he claimed because my best friend didn't feel the need to change their appearance, they're just faking it.

they made the argument that non binary is not the same as trans.

he kept repeating that because both are caused by dysphoria, they're the same thing and kept calling my best friend stupid and a faker, kept saying they had no idea what they were talking about, and that he was in the community so he knew best.

my best friend is a big softie and sensitive, didn't want to leave it on such rough terms, so they tried to explain that they felt as though non binary and trans are two separate identities, even though they're caused by the same thing a.k.a dysphoria

he had none of it and said how best friend is wrong and how they're just transphobic sjw trash and brainwashed, said he was ashamed to have dated them and many more ugly things.

Though I knew I wasn’t gay, there had been men; occasionally beautiful men, with whom I had flirted and kissed and admired for their confidence in being true to themselves. Also because of the incredible seduction of being wanted. When you are young and insecure, being wanted is hard to ignore. All I knew at the time was the idea of what was expected of me as a heterosexual male. Despite being only a boy relatively I felt the pressure of it and knew it was not a version of myself I recognised in any way.
I wanted to cry and not just when I was sad or in private. I wanted to cry at the beauty of the world, when a story filled me so full of any feeling that something must surely burst inside of me. I wanted to love people openly, flirt, dance, and wear things that were pretty and flamboyant.
The background to this was a crippling fear of everything and everyone. Ordinary conversations with strangers would flood my body with everything it needed to flee or fight. Hands would shake, voice would break and at the worst times the tears which should be something to enjoy from an over welling of life would become an involuntary and crippling response to a body so exhausted in the moment it doesn’t know what to do.
I would go to the marches with my friend Lex who was confident and outgoing but reserved. She had a great tolerance for her awkward friend who would tag along in these strange waters. A silent watcher off to the left, safe in her presence and given licence to learn to socially-swim through her natural buoyancy.
I lost contact a little with Lex over the years and stopped going to the marches. Little by little, I packed away the flamboyant parts of myself, and the brave parts of myself. The parts, which went to London and fought to find a different version of myself were allowed to atrophy. Excuses came to hand quicker than anything else; not just to other people but to myself.
There were some lonely years in this space of self-loathing and isolation.
Growing older you build layers of compromise around yourself like armour. Everything becomes easier with practice and life gets a little smaller, the problems a little more mundane.

I’m in this space now and want to return to pride again, to cheer all those who continue to put themselves out there despite the unfounded hatred people pour at them. To stand opposite those with signs of hate bearing signs of love.

Although I have gotten a lot of insight from lurking on here, I know nobody here can really give me THE answer about my gender identity. I have been depressed since hitting puberty and thought it would go away once I entered my 20s, but that has not been the case :))) Everything is going right in my personal life right now, and I'm revisiting my decade-long struggle with gender identity as a possible source for my unhappiness.  I was assigned female at birth and come from a culture with strongly distinct gender roles, and nobody in my family will really understand the ""concept"" of non-binary people. Femininity was constantly shoved down my throat when I was young, and as much as I hate it, a lot of my self-worth is based on other people perceiving me as ""feminine"" but I'm happiest when I don't think about my gender at all. I am just now am considering that I need to explore the possibility that I might be non-binary.

The thing I need advice on, is how to even begin exploring that option. I'm sort of rambling here, but basically, could someone offer some advice on how to start experimenting with gender expression (particularly masculine)? I have a curvier body, and although I loved masculine clothing as a teen, it objectively looked Bad on me. I would feel SO comfortable in my own skin and Good but if I caught a glance of my reflection, I would feel painfully self-conscious for the rest of the day.

I've identified as nonbinary since I was 17 and that identity became more and more a part of me as I got older. I thought I could set it aside and just tolerate being referred to with female pronouns in professional settings just so I could get by. But then it was killing me on the inside. It's hard to describe how it felt, but it felt wrong.

So halfway into my freshman year of college, I started emailing professors about my name and my preferred pronouns. Lucky for me, everyone was really receptive. A few times professors messed up, they would email me later that day apologizing. It was nice feeling validated. 

But as college was ending I was worried about going out into the real world. I went to.college for being a teacher and I live down south so we all know what that can be like. I tried dipping my toes in the water during student teaching. My University told me they supported my gender identity 100% and told me if I was placed in a school that didnt respect my identity, I could switch. And luckily the high school I student taught at was great and everyone there respected my pronouns. As a teacher I got to go by Mx._______. A lot of the LGBT students were happy I was there. 

And then I got a job. 

As an elementary teacher. 


I thought to myself its time to face the real world, just suck it up until you find another job. I was warned about possibly being rejected about being called they/them and Mx. In an elementary setting because students are still learning grammar and it may confuse them and I was fine with that. But, a few days after I got hired I just decided to shoot my shot and asked my principal, ""Hey is it okay if I go by Mx. ?""
And she said that was a great idea!

Im lucky that my county has a policy protecting me (which I didn't even know about.) I had a meeting with my principal and vice principal about making sure I felt comfortable at work and that people would only know what I needed them to know. I basically told them Im not going any further than explaining I identify as nonbinary, please use the following pronouns to refer to me. 

My students call me Mx. My colleagues use my proper pronouns. I never thought I'd get to this point in life or that it was even possible but it feels good, and I wanted to share it with everyone here to let them know there is a place for us in the world out therem

The things I don't dislike about my name and would keep if I could are: Irish, starts with a C, two syllables, ends with an N, 7 letters long.

Most of the names I'm toying with are 6 letters.

Ideally I'd also get to keep the fifth letter is an L. Context: my birth name results in all three of my names having an L as the fifth letter. Is this an important thing to maintain even if I think it's cute?

Names I've toyed with in no particular order: Callan, Caelan, Cian, Callen, Caolan, etc.

I think I like Callan the best. But then my brain wondered if I could say Caellan and still insist on the KAL-un pronunciation (obviously, this will result in a fair amount of correcting needing to be done). And the real kicker: will it drive me nuts when it's pronounced KAY-lin??

I would also add that I'm pretty ignorant about these kinds of topics so sorry if I come across as such. I was wondering if someone's sense of gender can change over time. For refference I'm a 21 year old cis-woman. 

I guess as a very young child I identified very strongly as being a girl, but around 8-11 I had this ""phase"". I was a 'tomboy' to such an extent that I wanted to change my name and everything. I presented very traditionally masculine and I wanted to be called a boy. It must have been a phase, but I stopped after being bullied pretty bad. On top of that, being called a guy just didnt feel right. Up until the past 3ish years I was very uncomfortable with my own femininity, but at the same time, I was afraid of being ridiculed for appearing more masculine . Eventually after high school, I started to explore my own androgyny.

I guess after exploring my own gender presentation it got me questioning my gender too. For the past two years I feel kinda awkward about being a 'woman'. Im definitely not a man, but sometimes I feel like I'm lying when I call myself a woman. I just feel so weird about it.

I wouldnt say I get dysphoric or anything, but sometimes I am really uncomfortable with some parts of my body such as my breasts and hips. Even to the point where I want to bind my chest. I dont want top surgery or take hormones or anything like that and I'm fine with my genitalia.

My mom was controlling and abusive growing up, and had very old-fashioned ideas about femininity - to the extent that I wasn’t even allowed to wear pants as a kid, I had to wear skirts and dresses. Needless to say I was never allowed short hair. My mom used to get angry about even the idea of me cutting my hair, even though I would never bring it up. She would just start randomly ranting unprompted how I could never do it, if I did I wouldn’t be welcome home, how it was her worst nightmare. 

I moved out when I was 16, but I still have to have a relationship with my mom in order to see my 5 younger siblings.

I feel so ridiculous, it’s just hair and I am a fully grown, financially independent adult. But when you grow up in an abusive household you grow up terrified of doing anything to make people angry or upset because you know what the consequences can be, and it’s so hard to let go of.

Cutting my hair has this massive fear attatched to it, and I’m finding it so hard to let go of. It’s not even fear of my mom’s reaction, she can’t touch me now. I think it’s a fear of the act itself, of looking ugly, of other people paying attention to me, of people making assumptions about me, of looking more masculine even though that’s what I want because I was always told that masculinity was wrong.

I also think that although I have identified as queer and been out for a long time, I’ve never really been visibly queer before. But now I think I’m going to be and that’s a scary thing in the world we live in.

From the moment I wake up, I feel like I'm trapped in a bubble and it just keeps getting smaller and smaller. I feel like I'm gasping for air when there is none. I've tried to ignore it but it just keeps getting worse. It's starting to affect my day to day life more than ever. Sometimes I can't even go college because of how it affects my anxiety.

I'm really scared about coming out. I'm only out to my bf and two other people that have forgotten I've even came out to them in the first place. I know that I can't keep up pretending to be something that I'm not to my friends. I want to be treated the way I should be. I'm worried that they won't accept me as a lot of them have some transphobic and enbyphobic opinions. I don't really want to associate with some of these people after I'm done with college but they're always around me in college so we have to socialise.

I'm not sure if I should see I can stick it out for another year until I go Uni or come out and try deal with that in college. A few of my friends are clocking on to me. I don't want them to figure it out and force me to come out. I want to come out on my own terms. I feel like I need to come out before the opportunity is taken from me. 

The only person that is fully supportive of me is my boyfriend. He's really amazing and I'm don't know what I would do without him. He understands how I feel as he's trans and knows how it feels when people don't refer to you by the right pronouns, name or treat you in a way that you don't want to be treated. He wants me to be comfortable with him and give me the same amount of respect, support and care I give him. 

I wish more people in the world were like him as I only feel like myself around him and vice versa. When I'm not with him, I feel like I'm playing a role of the person everyone thinks that I am.

Almost every verb in polish has it's female and male form, and only 'kid' and few items are the neutral form, but still u can use it only when saying 'this kid went there' else it's just not possible to say it without sounding like a complete idiot. We have gender forms to every form of verb, to a plural too (kinda (you cab find a better article on polish language ^^"""") So I came up with a neutral form (people litrally use it only when speaking a b o u t  a kid and a car):
'Would you do it' to a female would be: 'zrobiłabyś to?'
To a male: 'zrobiłbyś to?'
To a nonbinary* folk i would be: 'zrobiłobyś to?'
And it just sounds weird. Really weird. And it felt weird for me to say it in the beginnig too, but it wasn't making me uncomfortable like female or male form. And I wished people would use it. Like.. three if my friends do it unironically and i think they are gettin used to it (the one friend that used it ironically is not my friend anymore, I had some other reasons too but yeah) 
I have an agender friend and they use mostly male friend cus another option seems impossible, for most ppl. Once I texted this friend saying: 
   Me: hey, is it okay if I will use ono (this form) reffering to you?
I mean like: ono/jego (like they/them kinda?)
(Than I gave them few example sentences)
   Them:
YES
FINNALY SOMEONE 

Another thing in poland is the lack of neutral names.
Literally the only option in polish is Aleks (Alex).
So if we don't feel good with Alex we choose names in other languages like me: Leslie or non existing names like my friend: Aoi
Nb people in Poland be like:
Alex
Alex
Alex
Alex
Alex
Some random word in another language
Alex 
Alex
Alex
And all of those nb people are different and it can be really confusing with the same name

I hope that it will start changing for the better

I am writing my dissertation on the ways in which people communicate in online spaces and how online community spaces help to empower and support non-binary individuals. I will also be looking at how gender is expressed and constructed in these spaces and how experiences within these groups influences the ways in which people express themselves and feel in the offline world. To do this I am conducting a series of online interviews over messenger services.

2020-02-27 17:12:36,fafaim,3,1,"Hi,

So I am a young 25 year old who works full time in a business office as a marketing manager. I have a son and partner (female) and I am currently dealing with some gender identity things? I am a female by birth but that hasn’t felt quite right for the majority of my life. I dress more androgynous and prefer to just “be” without being a specific gender if you will. I am at a point where my name doesn’t seem to fit who I am, if that makes sense. 

I am wanting to change my name it is currently a more feminine name with no relative gender neutral names or masculine names like
It. I have a few I have chosen on but I’m really interested in the name Maxx. Just Max. I like it and it would be the same initial as my current name. My partner is very supportive with my decision of name changing. I plan to test this name out within my family/friends and then if it seems to fit I will continue with the process of changing it everywhere. I was just curious if anyone else as a young professional has ever changed their name while at their job, and how it went. My job is aware I am in a same sex relationship and they have noticed I dress very androgynous (I’ve had a few people comment on it) I just don’t know if it would be easy to change my name at work, or if I should just continue going by my birth name and just use my new name everywhere else? 


I have some questions for people who have gone through with this... How difficult was it changing your name in the eyes of friends/social media/family/work? 

How did you go about “announcing” your new name? 

Any advice for someone newly coming out as non binary? 


Does these name sound non binary/unisex to you?
August 
Mack
Maxx
Andie
Mars
Charlie
Ezra 

Also which do you prefer the best? (I know it’s ultimately up to me but I just wanted to see what everyone else enjoyed the most lol)

2020-02-29 12:37:11,fbby0r,6,1,"Hey All,

Just wanted to put some thoughts down on paper. I could have written this in a note, but decided to write here since  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ why not?

So for me my Non-Binary journey started a little over 18 months ago. I came out to a friend exactly 51 weeks ago, and since then I have been finding my comfort with playing with gender and figuring out how it and I relate.

I had always assumed that gender for everyone was kind of like a buffet you just take what works for you. It took until one of my closest friends started to transition to actually do more reading on gender. Holy. Fuck. Did. If. Blow. My. Mind. Before being her journey this friend had come out as gender queer, and had used they/them and I was ok with it, but I didn’t get it.
I didn’t really have a relationship with gender and didn’t understand it. I had actually been so far from understanding my own gender I had disassociated with it. Totally. Gone. Out of scope.

I have always been odd. I have always been ok with pushing the scope of normal. I had always said “the rules done apply”. The status quo is not for me. I had never considered that actually there is a gender that fits. There is a thing that works for the way my brain works. There was a something I could embrace and be a part of the status quo.

Discovering this, has been so massive. It shakes my whole world frequently. I feel like I am 20 years behind on a race to understand my self. I have started to play with my gender and this has made me feel comfortable, and sexy, and wonderful, and euphoric, and all kinds of things. 

I am also so grateful to the friend who showed me that. I should have seen it years ago. I have other non-binary friends and dismissed it. 😢 because I didn’t understand that they were different that this wasn’t everyone. I have made sure to make amends with them and explain why I never got it. I wish I had understood sooner. I wish when we had discussed gender that I had not been so convinced of my perspective.

Most recently I made the decision to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist, and have spoken to my GP who will give me a referral, but I need to tell her which I want, and honestly, I am not sure. I don’t know what I want from the process either, other than to figure out a little more about me, and try catch up and be my best &amp; truest me.

I am looking forward to this journey and seeing how it goes.

If you are still here thank you for reading.
It feels good to write this out loud.

CW: death of a family member
Today I came out to my mum. At first I was worried because even though I knew she’d accept me, I was scared she’d be upset.
I couldn’t do it in person, I was too scared about it. I broke down crying when I told my boyfriend, I didn’t wanna do that again. My mums had a hard time since my stepdad died two years ago

I messaged her last night about it. I didn’t receive a response at all. I was so worried she’d disowned me. I messaged her again this morning, told her that I hoped I didn’t upset her, and went to work. As I finished work, I saw that I still haven’t received another message from her. By now I was nervous. I had my boyfriend by my side comforting me through it all, but deep down something didn’t feel right.

My mum lives about 30 seconds away from my work, so I decided to go to hers (with my boyfriend) and confront the situation in person. It turns out, it was all a huge misunderstanding. She had indeed responded, I just for some reason hadn’t received the message. She showed my what she sent me (a huge paragraph about how much she respects me and how she accepts me no matter what). She doesn’t quite understand it, however it’s something that she’s happy to learn about. I gave her a huge hug and teared up a little. She’s very supportive of me changing my name, she even recommended getting it changed on deed poll (legally in the UK)

Overall, happy ending, i’m very happy about it, however i’m now worried about telling my dad and brother. My dad is a boomer (literally, he’s 71) and my brother is insanely transphobia and homophobic.
