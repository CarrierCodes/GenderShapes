2020-10-01 09:21:15,j358ju,1,1,"Brief history:

Been confused by my gender for years (amab). Not a woman, but don’t associate as being a man either. Been terrified to come out despite one of my partners being non binary and my immediate group loving them and accepting them. 

—

I’ve been uneasy to accept the concept of my non binary-ness for a while despite feeling that’s probably where I lay and I’ve been trying to figure out why. The people I love the most will accept me and they’re the most important thing but I think I’ve figured out a lot of my hesitation. 

When I was in school I was regularly bullied. From year 5 through to 11 when I left. It was multiple times a week and my teachers were fairly lacklustre to do anything to stop it, even to the point of me being hit during lessons. 

I won’t go into the full details but it left be with a lot of issues related to self worth, general fear, confidence and conflict avoidance. 

Fast forward to now, I present very masc. My bullying is in the past but it still lives in my memories. I consider how I’m presenting at all times because in my mind I need it as a defence. 

The thing is, I know presenting the way I do protects me to an extent. I’m seen as non disruptive element in society, I stay under the radar and if I do draw attention it passes over my quickly. 

To be seen as a straight man is to accept that privilege even if in doing so I harm my ability to be actualised as a bisexual non binary person and to lose the protection that  privilege grants is terrifying to me. I know I’m unlikely to be beaten in the streets or face the other litany of abuses I dealt with in my younger years now, I know that to the vast majority of people who aren’t part of my bubble I may continue to be seen as a man and not affect my external life but still the fear is a hurdle I don’t seem able to jump.

The title of the comic pretty much says what it's about. It's a memoir. About a genderqueer person. Not much more I can add to that. Okay, I'll talk a little bit more.

Gender Queer is an autobiographical comic by an afab enby who uses e/em/eir pronouns. It catalogues eir life from the moment e was in itty bitty enby, born in the early nineties, to now. I found a lot of eir struggles very relatable and it's a comic I highly recommend every trans person, even if they're not afab nonbinary because, regardless of how you identify, I think there's something in there every trans person can relate to. The scenes that got to me most were Maia's struggles to correct people on eir pronouns and how crushing that can be. But there's a lot of other fun stuff in their too like talks about masturbation and having dysphoria so bad you're stuck sobbing in your car for hours! Fun! Yeah, this isn't really a comic for really young folks as it does touch into a lot of adult material and general heavy stuff. Still recommend it, though (and hopefully I haven't scared off too many people from reading it).

2020-10-05 17:59:15,j5ocer,33,1,"For a little context, my partner has recently (as in 2-3 weeks ago) come to the conclusion that they are non-binary. There are no issues from her parents or myself at all. That being said, it is going to take some time for everyone to adjust, right? I mean, I've been referring to them by she/her and their birth name for over 5 and a half years, plus my autism makes habits harder to break, but I'm trying and they see that. I'm thankful to be with someone who is understanding, and they realise that changes like these can't be made in an instant. Rome wasn't built in a day and all that. Thankfully, we mostly refer to each other as love, babe, sweetie, and such, so we do have that to fall back on.

But, when I talked to my mum about it, she had doubts as she's never seen my partner act in a way that would indicate them being non-binary. She seems adamant that it's dangerous to come to the conclusion that they are non-binary after self research and talking to their best friend, who happens to be non-binary. My mum believes that my partner should talk to a specialist so they can determine if they are actually are non-binary. Her primary argument being that just because she's disabled (both my mum and my stepdad have multiple sclerosis) doesn't mean she's an expert on her disability, so the same would apply to my partner's friend.

I don't see where my mum is coming from at all. Whether she meant it this way or not, she's making being non-binary sound like a kind of condition that needs to be diagnosed. I'm not arrogant enough to claim that I understand how being non-binary works, because I know I only have a VERY vague understanding. But I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that, or at least I've never heard of non-binary being something that can be diagnosed.

Would you guys mind giving me some insight into this, please? This is completely need territory for me, so I have no idea what to do. For now, I'm just supporting my partner as much as I can. I may not understand how being non-binary works, but I'm more than happy to accept it. I love my partner more than anything, so I want to give them as much love and support as I can. I haven't told my partner about what my mum has said yet because I'm not sure what to do. I will when I get some more insight into it. I just don't want to jump to conclusions and make my partner feel even more overwhelmed than they already are. This can't be easy for them and I don't want to make it harder, on top of them already being stressed from trying to gain traction for their digital art commissions.

I'm thankful to be with someone who is understanding, and they realise that changes like these can't be made in an instant. Rome wasn't built in a day and all that. Thankfully, we mostly refer to each other as love, babe, sweetie, and such, so we do have that to fall back on.\n\nBut, when I talked to my mum about it, she had doubts as she's never seen my partner act in a way that would indicate them being non-binary. She seems adamant that it's dangerous to come to the conclusion that they are non-binary after self research and talking to their best friend, who happens to be non-binary. My mum believes that my partner should talk to a specialist so they can determine if they are actually are non-binary. Her primary argument being that just because she's disabled (both my mum and my stepdad have multiple sclerosis) doesn't mean she's an expert on her disability, so the same would apply to my partner's friend.\n\nI don't see where my mum is coming from at all. Whether she meant it this way or not, she's making being non-binary sound like a kind of condition that needs to be diagnosed. I'm not arrogant enough to claim that I understand how being non-binary works, because I know I only have a VERY vague understanding. But I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that, or at least I've never heard of non-binary being something that can be diagnosed.\n\nWould you guys mind giving me some insight into this, please? This is completely need territory for me, so I have no idea what to do. For now, I'm just supporting my partner as much as I can. I may not understand how being non-binary works, but I'm more than happy to accept it. I love my partner more than anything, so I want to give them as much love and support as I can. I haven't told my partner about what my mum has said yet because I'm not sure what to do. I will when I get some more insight into it. I just don't want to jump to conclusions and make my partner feel even more overwhelmed than they already are. This can't be easy for them and I don't want to make it harder, on top of them already being stressed from trying to gain traction for their digital art commissions.\n\nIf you guys need any additional context,  let me know in the comments and I'll answer as soon as I can. \n\nThank you\n\nI wish you all the best in these trying times"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Could I get some Non-Binary Advice, Please?', 'created': 1601945955.0}"

2020-10-06 05:31:22,j5zj7l,0,1,"Basically the title.

I've been out on my small boarding school of 250-ish people as non-binary for a few months now, and so far the response has been *great*. Pronouns, gender inclusivity, the whole deal - campus has been accepting and lovely. But despite the initial response, the majority of people just aren't used to it, I guess, so I get misgendered really often and it makes me feel terrible.

I don't know. I look at my AFAB enby friends and they all present so fabulously androgynous/masc/fem depending on what they feel like that day, and none of them get as severely misgendered as I do. I'm an AMAB and I haven't had the chance (thanks to COVID) to get some more feminine items, so I try to wear my masculine clothing the way ""a lesbian would"" with the help of some queer friends. It doesn't mean *anything* though, because I've been trying so hard for the past few weeks and I've just been misgendered *over* and *over* (my friends apologize and correct themselves, of course, but still) and it makes me feel terrible.

Something that really doesn't help is the fact that I'm still not sure if I'm just non-binary or if I'm full-blown MtF trans. I feel really happy and euphoric whenever someone refers to me by they, even more if they accidentally think I go by *she* (I'm seriously considering she/they now thanks to this), and/or if I get read as femme and someone uses ma'am/girls, for example. I love it. 

But the misgendering's been so bad that it's bringing the dysphoria into my room/personal spaces. Two days ago I bought a cute skirt and sweater from a friend and I love it, but the thought of people reading me as masc/a ""crossdresser"" (as crude as that sounds) just terrifies me and makes me hate my body. I've never felt such dysphoria in the past, aside from the first time I discovered I was non-binary, until today. I just wish my body was more stereotypically feminine so that I could pass as fem or at *least* androgynous. But in a place like a boarding school, where privacy just doesn't exist, I don't feel like I'm ever seen as non-binary anymore; like it's just something tacked on the side.

I feel terrible.

And I just don't know what to do? How do I go about feeling better about myself? My body? How do I gain the confidence to say ""screw it"" and just wear whatever the hell I want? How do I ask people to use my proper pronouns if they misgender me? (Because I've honestly given up the past few days, it's been too much.) I don't know.

I am a non-binary transmasculine person.

2020-10-08 12:20:40,j7c0vs,0,1,"So, I recently got an enby inclusive game that's the embodiment of be gay do crime. 

The plot is you're a supervillain and you're going to an evil conference for four days where you can spend the time going to talks on how to be a better villain or chatting up the other con attendees. I haven't played a whole lot of the game as of yet but it mostly seems to a parody of your typical villain tropes and can get pretty silly at times. I mean, come on, the entire basis of it is centered around a convention for villains. 

There is a character creation page that has a pretty decent selection of parts to dress your character up in and none of it is gender locked. The game doesn't even ask your gender, it asks for pronouns (He/She/They...the classics). This means it's totally possible to created a bearded character that uses she or a dress wearing character that uses he or they. The game don't care. 

There's also romance. Two men, two women and one they pronoun user. Who also happens to be your clone. Yeah, I don't think that's what people mean when they tell you to go fuck yourself. Also, one of the male romance options is the devil himself, who actually isn't that bad of a guy despite being the OP villain. This is a weird game and I love it. [You can buy Lovingly Evil on Steam.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1247020/Lovingly_Evil/)

Here are some evilsonas I created to show off the game's character creation.

2020-10-09 19:09:23,j857cg,6,1,"i am incredibly lost.
i don't know what my identity is.

i was born a female and have identified as such without a doubt in my mind until about a month ago. I started questioning my identity and realised that i am probably non-binary.

I have never been an overly feminine person and was called a ""tomboy"" growing up. I enjoy things that are not stereotypically feminine such as playing video games (sadly, it is commonly associated with boys and masculinity) and as a result i have made friends who are either non-binary or male (although recently a few of my friends came out as trans females) i have gotten along with girls, but i've never been able to relate to them or be close friends with them.

I have a weird relationship with being called a girl. Sometimes it feels okay, and sometimes it feels weird and uncomfortable. I've noticed that I feel fine being called a girl by adults and teachers at school (i'm 15) but being called a girl by people my age feels strange. I don't usually like calling myself a girl, but am fine with doing so occasionally which makes me think my gender identity is fluid. I do not feel any ties to masculinity or being male. I am neither masculine nor feminine a lot of the time. This causes me to think that I am somewhat gender neutral.

At first I thought I was FtM for about a year but still didn’t feel comfortable in my body so I just kinda dealt with being cis and uncomfortable.
This year is when I realized I was non-binary (i would’ve realized sooner but internalized enbyphobia really fucked me over).

I’ve come out to my older sister and she’s been so supportive of me.
I’m not coming out to my parents for reasons and now I gotta tell my friends and other sisters.

The biggest thing though is my boyfriend. We’ve been together for four years and he’s been 100% supportive of me the entire time.
I have various mental illnesses that he’s helped me deal with and even researched on his own to help me.
The problem is that he’s straight as an arrow.

He knows that I think gender is stupid and fake so I don’t think he’d be surprised if I came out to him but I’m worried that he’ll get in his head about dating someone who’s non-binary and if that makes him less straight.

He’s not like insecure about his masculinity or anything but sexuality is an important thing for a lot of people, ya know?

Context: I fell out with my biological dad during lockdown, because of a Facebook post (It’s now come to light I took it the wrong way but here we are).
I arrange for us to meet to talk things through.

I changed my name over two years ago and he has still called me by my dead name despite knowing I was using my new name. 

Also when I came out as agender, he ignored me for a week because he thought it had something to do with me being gay (this will make sense in second)

Situation:

I met him at the café and brought a copy of my deed poll and my passport, both of which show I’m using a different name. He got a bit defensive, so I assured him that I only wanted him to try, and that if he got it wrong and corrected himself, I wouldn’t go home crying about it. And then he said “but you are”. I said to him that my name change has nothing to do with sexuality, I’m not gay. And then he said “I’d rather that to be honest”. Then subject of conversation changed.

We ended on reasonably good terms, but I’m really hurt he’s not even going to try to get my name right. I didn’t even bring up pronouns because I know he would never make an effort with that.

I saw something about using different names for this parts but it will stupid to make someone calling something with name that doesn't correspond to what they see.

Hi! Idk if this is the right place, but r/nonbinarysupportgroup seems to be a bit inactive. Just to clarify: I think nonbinary people are amazing and I have always loved people who are gender non comforming in one way or another, even before I discovered nonbinary ppl existed. I have considered myself an ally of the queer community for years, though I must admit I wasn’t always the most well informed about issues (tho i still knew more than most cishet ppl apparently). Anything I may say about myself doesn’t apply to nonbinary people in general, just my own internalised queerphobia, i think.

Sometimes I freak out at the possibility of being nonbinary –well, at not being cis rather that the enby identity specifically. Nonbinary identities are not well known in my country and they’re often mocked at (see: attack helicopter joke). My friends are supportive of the queer community but they don’t know much about it, and since i’m now one of them (i am also bisexual) I don’t always feel comfortable educating them due to fear of rejection, as now it’d be more personal since i’m part of the community. 

Now i’m feeling better about it than when I started writing the post, but that’s because I managed to keep the thoughts of gender out of my mind, but I would like to have a more “permanent” way of being calm about it. I hate crying and freaking out because i’m not the cishet person I was meant to be. I see a lot of stuff about being proud of being queer and I think that’s amazing, but not so much about having trouble accepting ourselves, even when we wholeheartedly accept others.

Another issue is that most nonbinary people I see are more transmasc and I don’t think that’s me. I don’t have major issues with my agab, except sexism stuff of course, but the few I had were brushed off bc I assumed it was internalised misogyny, but I don’t think I ever identified as 100% a woman but at the same time I don’t feel like im not *not* one and I don’t want to drop out that identity completely because that’s what I thought I was for most of my life. I don’t experience dysphoria but seeing transmasc ppl being dysphoric makes me feel bad about myself, I don’t know why (i used to have a group of friends who have body image issues and when I was friends with them that thing stuck on me for a while, though not as severe as they or even most cis women).

This whole year has been such a roller coaster for me. From finding out about my ADHD, bipolar disorder, worsening depression, and exploring my hidden traumas. And to add to that, the struggle of trying to figure out my identity. During the summer, I contemplated the idea that I might be a transwoman. And then, the idea that I might just actually be gender fluid or non-binary. 

I’ve been struggling a ton with gender dysphoria. However, one thing I noticed that I don’t have in common with many trans women is that I don’t suffer with body dysphoria *(at least relating to genitalia or any other body parts. I’ve always been self-conscious about my weight but that’s a topic for another time I guess lol).* I’m fine with having a penis, looking at the mirror doesn’t ruin my day, and I don’t particularly feel the need to present femme.

Trans people have been more understanding, but one girl blatantly said me defending my right to not be touched where I don't want to ""ruined the mood"" and that I would make ""the perfect girlfriend"".

2020-10-25 07:39:24,jhpk7t,9,1,"I'm AFAB nonbinary. My gender identity is Neutral, neither a man nor a woman. But I often experience gender as fluctuating feelings of masculinity and feminity, and I have more feminine gender feelings than masculine ones, so I tend to view my gender as ""feminine but not female"". (For those familiar with ""mogai"" terms, I've called myself both lunettian and librafeminine in the past.) My personality in general doesn't come across as very masculine, and I prefer to wear clothes from the women's section such as dresses and pretty blouses. Due to being a feminine person and not seeing my gender identity as male or adjacent to male, I've never considered myself to be ""transmasculine"".

However, recently I can't seem to stop thinking about going on T, and the urge has been really confusing me. I would love to have a deeper voice, facial hair, and a more masculine build. I feel somewhat neutrally towards other effects like genital changes and body hair. My curvy feminine body and round/soft looking face never really feel like Me, and I can only accept seeing myself naked if I depersonalize/dissociate from it. Sometimes I'll even see a specific man and think ""it would be really nice to look like that!"" In an ideal world people wouldn't automatically judge me to be female OR male. However, being referred to as a woman feels way more distressing than being referred to as a man (though both are wrong) so when it comes down to it, transitioning from being mistaken for female to being mistaken for male is a small improvement.

All of this just seems strange to me. I mean yeah, gender presentation =/= gender identity, but being a feminine person has always been an important part of how I experience my gender. It's hard to explain, but it feels meaningful to me. The way I dress is also a purposeful expression of who I am, so I can't entirely disregard it or treat it as irrelevant. And yet in spite of usually having a feminine presentation, for some reason I want my body to be more masculine? I want to have a masculine body type AND wear dresses, simultaneously. I want my femininity to be seen as defying norms rather than conforming to them, which is the way it feels internally. But my issue is that the contradiction between my hopes for my body and my gender experiences/expression just makes me wonder if my desire to go on T is invalid or wrong.

TLDR; My main question for you all is just, is it weird to want a masculine body and to go on T, despite having a feminine-leaning gender and presenting in a feminine way? Also, has anyone else on here experienced this sort of incongruity or gone on T while continuing to dress femininely?",NonBinaryTalk,Are these feelings weird?,1603636764.0,"{'created_utc': 1603611564, 'id': 'jhpk7t', 'num_comments': 9, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I\'m AFAB nonbinary.

I mean yeah, gender presentation =/= gender identity, but being a feminine person has always been an important part of how I experience my gender. It\'s hard to explain, but it feels meaningful to me. The way I dress is also a purposeful expression of who I am, so I can\'t entirely disregard it or treat it as irrelevant. And yet in spite of usually having a feminine presentation, for some reason I want my body to be more masculine? I want to have a masculine body type AND wear dresses, simultaneously. I want my femininity to be seen as defying norms rather than conforming to them, which is the way it feels internally. But my issue is that the contradiction between my hopes for my body and my gender experiences/expression just makes me wonder if my desire to go on T is invalid or wrong.\n\nTLDR; My main question for you all is just, is it weird to want a masculine body and to go on T, despite having a feminine-leaning gender and presenting in a feminine way? Also, has anyone else on here experienced this sort of incongruity or gone on T while continuing to dress femininely?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Are these feelings weird?', 'created': 1603636764.0}"

I have such a negative self image and I believe part of the cause is how society expects people to act based on sex and gender. I feel like a freak because I want to dress androgynously and masculinely (as of right now I do not care for “feminine” clothes on myself- that is subject to change) and have facial hair but be called she/her. I will accept any pronouns but I find that being called he/him is kind of strange for me- I have a very complicated relationship with he/him pronouns but I can’t say I hate them. 

Regardless, I will honestly accept any pronouns, even it/its, which many are understandably uncomfortable with. I don’t mind them.

I just know that my family would not understand if I talked to them about how I feel. I don’t like revealing my AGAB usually but I am AFAB for context. I don’t know if I am nonbinary or just a masculine woman? I just have many complicated gender-related feelings. I would like to go by a more androgynous or masculine name but I’m sure my family would question that as well.

I just wish I could be masculine/“male” presenting and have gender not be a factor. That way I could look the way I want and not feel undesirable, or strange, or whatever.

I will tell them, I am still just a bit scared.

So, my waist is 10 inches smaller than my hips. On more fem leaning days this is fine because I can wear something snug and be okay with my curves, but on more masculine days I really struggle.
Anything that I wear that is more square hugs my hips and chest and creates a weird bubble around my waist. If I wear something very large I still look lumpy and feel very large which is problematic because of my body image and ed issues.

   So I'm 13 and born Female I realize not long ago I was a lesbian and recently I've been questioning my gender. I don't feel like a guy or a girl, but I don't think I have dysphoria but I'm still not sure on what dysphoria is. I'm pretty sure I'm non-binary though but I need help learning more about everything. Here are some questions I have/things I want to know.

   How many genders are there?
Could I be faking it?
Is being non-binary being trans?
Is it dysphoria if I don't want big breast but also don't want no breast? What is this called? And how do I deal with it?
What is a good way to choose a name?
How do I get a binder, identify with my name and pronouns when my whole family is homophobic and transphobic?

2020-10-30 20:27:17,jl4jh3,7,1,"So I've been questioning my gender for over a month now and I'm pretty sure that I'm nonbinary. I've lately started experiencing some body dysphoria and thought about buying a binder. But buying a binder would also mean telling my mom at least that I've been questioning my gender. With that probably comes questions that I've prepared for, but I'd like to know your thoughts on my answers.

I thought about what if my mom asks me if I'm still comfortable being called her daughter or my brothers sister, and honestly I thi k I'm fine with it. It doesn't really bother me, if I'm called a daughter, sister, etc. however I'm not sure how I feel about being called a girl (maybe bc I rarely ever hear anyone straight up calling me a girl). Does not feeling uncomfortable with these genderd word mean that I might not be nonbinary? Like I know every experience is different and I've thought it's just bc im comfortable enough in my gender identity that it doesn't bother me but idk. What if that confuses people? I guess it's just that I've gotten in my 17 years so used to being called someone's daughter or sister that I don't really see myself not being referred to as those. Also, going by they/them pronouns in my own language (Swedish, in which case my pronouns would be hen instead of hon) seems odd, but using them in English sounds fine, so anyone know why?

Anyways, sorry for making this so long.
