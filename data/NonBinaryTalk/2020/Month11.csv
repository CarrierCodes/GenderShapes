I wanted to get some opinions on language and how it is sexist. I will be shortly creating a video about this topic and I wanted to know how these words make you feel, why is it bad for society, and any ideas on how we could change!! Please feel free to message me or just simply comment below...

So to begin I want to discuss language such as 
Actor / actress 
Waiter / waitress 

Like what is the need for these words in today‚Äôs society? When you can say teacher, doctor, nurse, shop assistant and they are not gendered

And how it stems from Romance languages, and I truly believe these languages are more sexist than English but I could be wrong because I‚Äôm so used to English. For example in French and Spanish, you have a different word for ‚Äúthey‚Äù when they are only women... but you could have 100 women and one man, and the they becomes masculine... pure bonkers if you ask me.

2020-11-03 23:38:29,jnlp2y,0,1,"I'm stuck between FTM transman and non-binary. I need help.



‚ñ™ Background :


I live in a very concervative LGBT-phobic area and can't explore things much! I also can't trust the therapists that live here, so I can't go tho therapy sessions.

My family is also somewhat LGBT-phobic, specially if the LGBT person was someone in the family. I'm an adult, in my 20s, but currently live with my mother. 


‚ñ™ Family Issues :


My family/relatives cannot accept me. I'm still in the closet, but I cut my hair short and wear gender neutral/boyish clothes. 

They (especially my mom) are ashamed of me, and they keep telling me that every once in a while, specially whenever I cut my hair short.

Basically, I know I'm going to face a big argument, drama or hear a lot of nasty things everytime I cut my hair short.

About 9-10 years ago, I told my mom that I might be FTM and want to transition, she cried and made a big drama out of it until I decided to go deep into the closet.

A few years ago, I got over my guilt and anxiety, and started expressing myself again. I started cutting my hair and wearing neutral/boyish clothes ""without defining myself"".


‚ñ™ My Identity Issue :


I finally found out about non-binary/GQ, and while it sort of fits, I have two issues with it ;

a) I'm not sure If I'm doing it because I'm truly non-binary, or out of guilt, shame or compromising for my family and the society, and finding a middle ground between pretending to be a female and keeping other pleased but feeling depressed and dysphoric, and comming out and having to face a lot of things.

b) Non-binary/GQ is not really accepted yet. Where I currently live, it's not even a thing. And in other places, some people deny or make fun of these identities. 


‚ñ™ Me :


I have dysphoria, both body dysphoria and gender dysphoria.

I prefer to leave where I currently am and I'm working my way towards it but It's really hard.

I can't afford physical transition at the moment. I definitely want mastectomy and hysterectomy when I can afford it.
But I have doubts about HRT and bottom surgery.

I wish I was born as a cis guy, but I also have height dysphoria and know that transitioning cannot give me cis-male life experience.

I kind of think non-binary and they/them would be a better identity for me based on my overall situation and doubts. It also makes me numb, so I think less about gender and gender dysphoria and get less depressed.

However, I'm afraid of not being taken seriously as non-binary, and still being treated as a girl due to being AFAB.

Especially that I'm mostly into men (used to identify as gay, and still prefer gay-dynamic relationships), and I'm worried about only attracting straight men who see me and treat me as a girl.

I am struggling to have patience while my friends/fam/community adjust to using gender-neutral pronouns for me.  I prefer they/them.  I came out only a year ago, December. Sometimes I worry I am being too imposing, asking people to correct themselves anytime they ""she"" me, as I was afab. 

I am a proud non-binary person.  I want people to see me as such, and to evolve their linguistics to make it easier and more acceptable for people like me in mainstream society. I am always ready and willing to explain that this evolution is not just for my sake, but for the sake of a more accepting society.  But sometimes, I feel I am interrupting, distracting from the conversation, by inserting my pronoun corrections.  

Ideally, people would just feel more comfortable and second-nature about using they/them.  But, outside of queer contexts (sometimes even within), this seems like a huge challenge for people around me. 

Sometimes, I consider circling back and saying ""she/he/they"" are all appropriate pronouns for me. Just for the sake of making conversations shorter, and less focused on my identity! 

I think what I have a problem with, is the discomfort, as though I am pulling focus onto myself at moments when I have to clarify my identity/correct my pronoun. There is frustration within this feeling, because I want to be true to myself, and be a soldier for the validation of trans identities. How does one work through the discomfort? 

I am seeking commiseration with my enby siblings.  Is anybody else struggling to stand firm and loud, and be assertive about correcting people?

If this is inappropriate at all please let me know and I'll take down the post and try find some other resources but I just feel so confused?

Like, I'm fine being referred to with she/her pronouns but I really like the way they feels and, frankly, the happiest I've ever been was walking down a street after the gym one day when I'd had my hair buzzed really short and feeling like a question mark and it was really great.

2020-11-07 22:04:39,jpzdqt,1,1,"I'm stuck between FTM transman and non-binary. I need help.



‚ñ™ Background :


I live in a very concervative LGBT-phobic area and can't explore things much! I also can't trust the therapists that live here, so I can't go tho therapy sessions.

My family is also somewhat LGBT-phobic, specially if the LGBT person was someone in the family. I'm an adult, in my 20s, but currently live with my mother. 


‚ñ™ Family Issues :


My family/relatives cannot accept me. I'm still in the closet, but I cut my hair short and wear gender neutral/boyish clothes. 

They (especially my mom) are ashamed of me, and they keep telling me that every once in a while, specially whenever I cut my hair short.

Basically, I know I'm going to face a big argument, drama or hear a lot of nasty things everytime I cut my hair short.

About 9-10 years ago, I told my mom that I might be FTM and want to transition, she cried and made a big drama out of it until I decided to go deep into the closet.

A few years ago, I got over my guilt and anxiety, and started expressing myself again. I started cutting my hair and wearing neutral/boyish clothes ""without defining myself"".


‚ñ™ My Identity Issue :


I finally found out about non-binary/GQ, and while it sort of fits, I have two issues with it ;

a) I'm not sure If I'm doing it because I'm truly non-binary, or out of guilt, shame or compromising for my family and the society, and finding a middle ground between pretending to be a female and keeping other pleased but feeling depressed and dysphoric, and comming out and having to face a lot of things.

b) Non-binary/GQ is not really accepted yet. Where I currently live, it's not even a thing. And in other places, some people deny or make fun of these identities. 


‚ñ™ Me :


I have dysphoria, both body dysphoria and gender dysphoria.

I prefer to leave where I currently am and I'm working my way towards it but It's really hard.

I can't afford physical transition at the moment. I definitely want mastectomy and hysterectomy when I can afford it.
But I have doubts about HRT and bottom surgery.

I wish I was born as a cis guy, but I also have height dysphoria and know that transitioning cannot give me cis-male life experience.

I kind of think non-binary and they/them would be a better identity for me based on my overall situation and doubts. It also makes me numb, so I think less about gender and gender dysphoria and get less depressed.

However, I'm afraid of not being taken seriously as non-binary, and still being treated as a girl due to being AFAB.

Especially that I'm mostly into men (used to identify as gay, and still prefer gay-dynamic relationships), and I'm worried about only attracting straight men who see me and treat me as a girl.

I've been out about 18months and am 29, so it isn't an issue with high school bullying or whatever. I'm lucky to have a cohabiting partner and a small handful of friends who are supportive.

But I've lost my non-profit nonprofit sector job, had to move back in with my parents (including transpobic father). I've been harassed by staff at utility companies over my gender identity leading to collections agency being sent after me for money I did not owe. My parents think my partner is weird for staying with me and that I am harming him (he knew I was trans before we got together). I've lost a lot of my formerly large friendship group and the friends I am still close with come with some who misgender me heavily. I was not able to access my own bank account for months because of a combination of incompetence and queerphobia. Local therapy service says it is ""against policy"" to gender me correctly (this appears to be bullshit but it's the only mental health treatment available to me and I'll run into issues with welfare if I don't persue treatment).There is a LOT more bad stuff that's happened in the 18months since I came out but I won't keep ranting.

How do you cope? Does it get better? I'm in a decent sized city (over 750,000people) but wondering if maybe coming out living in the UK was a mistake.

i recently came out to my closest few friends on my private story, so i didn't have to tell them individually because i was nervous. my best friend said she was proud of me etc but never really changed language because we don't really use things like ""ms"" ""ma'am"" ""girly"" etc.

she has no idea how much that meant to me. she realized what she was saying and changed for me. she has no idea that that conversation pops up in my head randomly and makes me cry because it means so much, because i know she cares. it's hard to realize she does because we don't use lots of gendered language when talking to each other, so that moment really made me happy.

Are there any AMAB's here who take low dose estrogen?

I also really love my facial hair and don't want to lose what I have, I really just want to grow breasts.

From what I've read it sounds like anti androgens wouldn't be for me, but I can't seem to find whether breast growth is possible from just estrogen alone. I heard that estrogen doesn't directly shrink you down there and that topical testosterone might help, do you know if estrogen effects the testicles/penis at all? Will any doctors even want to treat me or will I be turned away? :(

I‚Äôd rather not have them but I also don‚Äôt wanna cut them off? Anyway, so my girlfriend today made a remark that she loves them and I was like ‚Äúwould you also love me without‚Äù? And she was like ‚Äúwell it would suck, I really love boobs‚Äù..and I don‚Äôt know why but I felt hurt and she saw that and said ‚Äúwell sorry, I would still love you without boobs and even with a penis but i‚Äôm a lesbian!‚Äù. And then it hit me. She doesn‚Äôt understand my identity, how I don‚Äôt even think in the sense of being a woman, I‚Äôm not even only into women, so I‚Äôm also not a lesbian. What am i? I don‚Äôt know. I guess non-binary but then, if she‚Äôs into me, it wouldn‚Äôt make her a lesbian cause being a lesbian means a woman being into woman. I don‚Äôt know how to clarify this with her or how to approach it. I am sure it must be hard for her to see all these ‚Äúchanges‚Äù in me, even though for me it‚Äôs just more and more becoming ME.

1. A couple of days ago, my grandma was telling me about how when I was a little kid, I would always try and make myself look more ‚Äúboyish‚Äù and tell her that I wasn‚Äôt a girl.

2. When I was younger, I had an obsession with being a tomboy, and avoided anything I considered ‚Äúgirly‚Äù. I would even tell my family to stop calling me my birthname ‚ÄúAshley‚Äù and to change it to ‚ÄúAsh‚Äù.

3. I always had a liking of shorter hair. Every time I looked in the mirror and saw my long hair it made me uncomfortable. I would always look up pictures of women with shorter hair and imagine myself with it.

4. I‚Äôve always kind of had my own daydream world, and when I was younger my persona in the world always switched from being a girl to a boy. I could never decide because neither of them felt like the real me.

5. All throughout my life, I had an attachment to gender non-conforming characters. Whether that character be a tomboy or even characters who don‚Äôt have a confirmed gender like Crona from Soul Eater or Frisk/Chara from Undertale.

All this can make me feel often invalidated and insecure in nonbinary spaces. I know i'm nonbinary, so i'm no longer in the panic of questioning, but I still feel very invisible and alienated. Not like binary people because I don't get the whole man/woman thing, but not like nonbinary people because I don't present or strive towards what sometimes feels like an ideal based around the idea that we are a third gender spawned from the other two.

In my letter for hrt my therapist identified me as transmasc and I left it in because I thought it would help my case honestly. And I'm going to talk to him about this but I don't think I would identify myself as transmasc? Like even a little bit? Even though I'm now masculinizing my body?


I want to be femmasc. I feel like a boygirlboygenderfuck. I feel like everything, every possible gender, and at the same time¬†I don't want to be anything honestly, I want to fuck up this whole gender game.


It feels like now that people know I'm on hormones, they all finally ""get it"" like it simplifies things for them. Like now I'm going to be masculine, now I'm going to cut my hair, now I'm going to be a boy. That finally makes sense to them. But I'm not a man and I don't want to be a man. I don't even know if I'm going to be on hormones until I appear ""man"" because I don't want to pass as a man. I don't want to pass as anything.¬†


It's just wayyyy oversimplified for people now. My therapist is gay and very educated and great about my gender, but he keeps bringing up me taking hormones ""so my insides match my outsides."" Which is maybe the easiest way for cis people to understand these things but, idk, idk? My insides aren't boy, or aren't solely boy. My insides aren't solely masculine. My insides aren't someone who passes as a man. I guess my insides are someone with features that are typically associated with AMAB people? But like, that's where it ends. My insides are so ungendered and so everything gendered.


It's even jarring when people refer to this as me transitioning. Like now I'm Transitioning with a capital T. When I hadn't even thought about this as part of my transition for some weird god knows what reason? Maybe because I'm not seeing any changes yet, maybe that will change and I will feel like I'm transitioning? Idk.


I've been thinking about how excited I am to physically¬†appear more masculine because I'll feel comfortable wearing dresses again. I love dresses, I feel like a dress fits my whole vibe, but I stopped wearing them once I came out because I didn't want it to invalidate me in other people's eyes¬†as an nb AFAB person. But I'm so excited to wear dresses again. And I don't think that is what people are expecting from me at ALL. That's my gender goal but it's the furthest thing from people's minds because now I'm on Testosterone.


Idk. Maybe this is the most incoherent post. I'm so fucking nonbinary. In my soul I'm nonbinary. Before I felt like I was smashed into a female box because I do pass as a cis female with my long hair. But now I'm feeling like I'm being smashed into a male box. Now I'm transmasc because I'm on testosterone. Now my friends are asking if I'm going to cut all my hair off. And it's like, no to all of that


I'm just realizing that I have no, like absolutely no, desire pass as cis, I have no desire to appear binary. I want to fuck it ALL up. I want to be EVERY gender, I want to piss the cowboys in my town off (except I do fear violence lol) I want to fuck with everyone's expectations. But I can't escape the binary, everyone constantly wants to binarize me, and it feels like that's just increasing with hormones. You just can't win you know.


And don't even get me started on my sexuality.


Anyway. Let me know if this made sense at all or struck a chord or meant anything to you, bc I'm feeling very fucking alone. It's like there's the way my body appears. And there's the way how I present myself. And then there's how my soul appears, which is a swirling cosmos of masculinity and feminity and androgyny and girl and boy and nothing and everything all at once. And I have to wrangle all of that into some kind of person to present to society.

2020-11-21 23:57:49,jylgj7,17,1,"Hello !
One time I met someone and assumed they were a girl but then I went on their Facebook page and one of the first post was ""don't assume someone's gender just because of their apparence. Non-binaries don't owe anyone to look androgynous""
Which sounds absolutely true.

So since, I have been trying to keep in my mind to have they/them my default pronon, so I consider everyone a they/them (as in ""gender unknown"" not as in ""non-binary"") as long as I don't get their pronouns or that I see them react positively to being called a certain pronoun; that even if the person ""looks"" cis, because i understand it's wrong to make assumption based on the look.

When I am in front of someone, I don't use pronouns anyways because it's not polite to speak indirectly as far as i know anyway (so I only use ""you"")
But in my job, i have to write reports as ""1 person didn't wear their mask this evening, they ended up putting it on after i asked three times"" etc. So i always use they/them (as in ""gender unknown"") on those reports even if most of my coworkers use gendered pronouns.

But tonight, I suddenly started wonder if that was the correct way to go? I see two issues with this

1) would i be one of those peoples homophobic/transphobic/non-binary denier use to say LGBT+ community has a gay agenda they try to impose on the rest of the world by calling everyone they?

2) do I attack the meaning of they/them as a non-binary pronoun by using it as an ""unknown gender"" pronoun?

I love you non-binary community (actually been wondering for a while if I am non-binary, trans and straight, or cis and gay) - and if you wouldn't mind sharing your opinion on this, I would totally take the input !

Have a great evening !

‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt really like she/her pronouns. In online games when somebody just assumes I‚Äôm a guy I feel much more comfortable, but i also feel that way if somebody just uses they or them.

‚Ä¢I like dressing masculinely.

‚Ä¢I tried binding with sports bras and I preferred the way my chest looked, but when I‚Äôm just chilling I don‚Äôt pay much mind to my chest.

‚Ä¢when I look at myself in the future, I don‚Äôt really see myself having a female body, but I don‚Äôt see myself as having a male body.

‚Ä¢My name is Caoimhe, and I‚Äôm happy with this name and it‚Äôs been a huge source of doubt. Is it possible to be non-binary and still identify with your given name? I don‚Äôt really see it as a girl or boy‚Äôs name. I see it as my name. And I can‚Äôt imagine being addressed by a different name.

I was thinking I might be ftm, but now I‚Äôve been realising that I don‚Äôt really align with that either. I just feel kinda in the middle but tilting a bit more to the M.

I‚Äôve been seriously questioning my gender since the beginning of this year and have been internally identifying as genderqueer. I‚Äôve discussed my gender feelings a little with my closest irl friends but have not asked them to refer to me differently as of now. 

I‚Äôm more open about my gender exploration with my online friends, though. I used to list my pronouns as ‚Äúshe/they‚Äù but I realized that I also enjoy when people refer to me with he/him pronouns so I changed to ‚Äúany/all.‚Äù

As for my name, I have chosen a new one that I go by online now but haven‚Äôt had it in me to announce to my irl friends yet. I‚Äôve been thinking about legal name changes and my current idea is that I‚Äôll keep my same first name, change my middle name to my chosen name, and just be someone who goes by their middle name. I‚Äôve never liked my current middle name and I feel pretty neutral toward my first name and don‚Äôt feel the need to eject it from myself completely. 

I guess where I start questioning my own motives is that one reason I‚Äòve considered for only changing my middle name is so it might sting less when my family never refers to me by my chosen name. Same goes for my pronouns and why I feel like clinging to ‚Äúany/all‚Äù. I‚Äôm scared for anyone I‚Äôm talking to to be technically wrong in the way they refer to me because I imagine it being so hurtful and frustrating. I know it is.

At the same time there‚Äôs a voice in my head telling me I‚Äôm not valid if I don‚Äôt assert myself with they/them pronouns and also that I‚Äôm just scared of being misgendered or trying to cheat my way out of the hardest parts of being trans.

So, demigirl is out, because for me that identity is a lie. However, it isn't a lie because I am disconnected from womanhood, but because I am connected to masculinity and gender-neutrality as well.

2020-11-25 05:07:59,k0lpns,0,1,"I'm making this primarily because I made the mistake (lol) of scrolling through the popular tab. On r/movies there was this post about how Kirsten Stewart, who recently played a lesbian character in a Christmas movie, thought that there was a 'slippery slope' when it comes to only letting queer characters play queer roles. She said in her experience, she has met straight people who have played queer actors well, and that while there are some stories that should only be told by queer people, she felt there was a a gray area in part because she then thought that applying this would mean only straight actors would be able to play straight roles. 

All in all I pretty heavily disagree with her stance - I understand that there is gray area, especially when we consider how some previously cishet identified actors played queer roles and then realized they were queer because of these roles, or always knew they were queer, but are closeted. Or with characters who have been on TV for a while, played by straight actors, and further along in the narrative writers feel it makes sense for them to be queer or have a queer romance. Recasting wouldn't make sense in that case. Otherwise I do think priority should go to people who have that experience, because it seems utterly remiss to me that there are queer people who can't find work in the industry because of bias and homophobia/transphobia/Biphobia/acephobia, while cishet actors make money and build their careers off of their experiences. Obviously I've seen straight people play queer people really well, but again, I think it's an issue of priority as a way of combatting bias (and producing more authentic stories). And at the end of the day, I think it's inaccurate to say queer people can't play cishet characters out of a fear of 'hypocrisy' because being queer is a marginalised experience and being cishet is not. It's not appropriate to compare them. And considering how many cishet roles there are on tv in comparison to queer ones, literally no cishet actor is missing out by only or primarily playing cishet roles. There are probably hundreds of super well known actors that have never played queer roles and have had plentiful, successful well paying roles. Cishet people are not being deprived by not playing queer characters. And if they feel they 'need' to play these roles to empathise with the experience, they can simply learn about these communities like every other cishet person does - by reading and learning and making queer friends and getting into conversations. They don't need to play these roles to do that. It would be nice to live I  a world where it really just about empathy, and maybe when we come to a point in history where that bias and subtle discrimination isn't an issue, we can pick whomever is best for the role. But we aren't there yet.

Of course there's room for disagreement and discussion, but on r/movies it just seemed like a lot of the arguments being made were ignorant and bad faith? A lot of people saying things like 'You don't need to be a cop to play a cop', 'Guess we can only hire orcs if there's ever a new LOTR' and 'Neil Patrick Harris has played straight characters amazingly, who cares, just pick the best person for the role!' And it's like - being a cop (of ALL things) is not an oppressed identity, it's a career lol. A lot of people just seemed to ignore the central reasoning, which is that being queer is a marginalized experience and being straight is not, and that's where the disparity is. Yeah, we would love for the best person to be chosen, but we live in a world  where casting directors and show runners and writers have bias, and that bias holds queer people back from growing as actors and having access to opportunity, especially when they have multiple overlapping marginalized identities (so not Neil Patrick Harris and Kristen Stewart). There were also lots of people complaining about how the same is being applied to writers, when the whole point of acting and writing is to learn about others through empathy. Which again, is not false, but there's a problem when the most well funded and popular shows representing a marginalised group are written by people who don't belong to that group. Cishet people have more resources and access to creating stories about queer people than actual queer people do, so people who don't even have that experience define what it is like to be queer in media. Usually very badly. _That's_ the problem. And we ALL know what it's like to see a train wreck of representation and find out there wasn't a single queer person in the writing room, or very few who were likely spoken over or silenced. And if you're at the point where you're more than happy to elbow out others who will likely tell a story better and more authentically when you know you already have privilege and resources on your side, you're not doing that because of empathy. You're doing it out of ego over not liking being told what you can and can't do. This is often even worse with trans and nonbinary characters. People also applied this to disabled people and shit on the idea that disabled characters should be played by disabled actors. The whole things was yikes. 

So I guess I'm wondering - what are your thoughts on this? And what is your experience discussing queer issues on non-queer subreddits? Unfortunately in my experience it has not been good, past very basic things like someone saying they've come out as something, I've mostly been met by willfull ignorance and people looking for validation over their bigotry. And I know someone is going to give some response akin to 'well what did you expect' or 'can't expect the whole world to like you' and I *know* lmao.

2020-11-26 23:21:18,k1pqam,15,1,"Yes, I know this question might sound very stupid, and looks like the title of a copypasta, but lately I'm really struggling to decide whether I'm actually nb or I'm just a boy that hates gender and masculinity, and I would love to hear opinions from nb people themselves, as I don't personally know anyone myself. 

So first of all, here's my situation:
I never liked anything related to my gender, never liked football, I couldn't care less about cars, don't like sports, hate doing mechanical work... from time to time in my life I would randomly wonder: ""what if I were a girl?"" or ""I wish I were a girl for this reason"" and sometimes I just want to act femenine which to this day I only do it when I'm alone, also in the last year or so I started hating genders because I don't like having roles or expectations about likes and ways to be just for my (or anyone's) existence. And I forgot to mention I'm also very curious about trying out make up or wearing skirts but i never had the opportunity to. 

Lately a couple of my friends have come out about different things, and realizing how much LGBT people is around me, my doubts about my gender have become stronger.

After thinking a lot about it, I've come to the conclusion that I don't feel like a girl. But. My doubts come when I think if I really feel like a boy.

I don't have a problem with my body hair, my beard, my genitals, my anything related to my body. And when people call me a ""he"" i don't really care.

But I don't know if I don't care because I'm used to it, or because I have never been referred as other than that my whole life, maybe I am a he/they?? 

But also I don't really like being associated with men, and what s o c i e t y sees as a man, I don't like genders as I said before and I don't really know at what point that dislikeness comes from not really feeling represented as a male or not.

And, as many of you may know, in spanish there's no gender neutral, and nobody (at least in my experience) really uses the ""e"" to replace genders, at least not in a casual context or without feeling weird and forced, and when I think about that I realize that I would just go as a he since I never had a problem with it.

Also I know that I can perfectly be a cis male and at the same time hate genders, like to act femenine, and reject gender roles. But that's why I'm making this post to begin with. 

Every time I stop to think about it I change between ""yeah I'm nb"" to ""nah I'm male"" like a damn metronome so I was wondering if I could have some first hand advice.

2020-11-27 11:55:09,k1ztvl,12,1,"All my life I‚Äôve been comfortable with being cis gender... until recently. 

It isn‚Äôt what I had a say in as no one gets to decide what sex they‚Äôll be, but I was fine with just being what everyone told me to be because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

Younger me like everyone else always believed: No one wants to be ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù, right? 

I was always the kid that was friends with both the boy and girl group, and I do remember countless times being the ‚Äúdad‚Äù when role playing with other kids, and others being confused about why I preferred it. But I was still fine as a girl. I didn‚Äôt feel an urge to be anything else. When I hit puberty I still felt fine, because I felt I had to be normal, and if I‚Äôm normal that‚Äôs what‚Äôs good no matter what I think deep down. I was comfortable with my chest and my lower area because if I didn‚Äôt have one it‚Äôd be strange to not right? 

But now I‚Äôm almost 15, and I‚Äôve learnt a lot more about the lgbtq community and it‚Äôs had me thinking. If I had the choice to not care about anything anyone believes is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I‚Äôd want to be the option that‚Äôs neutral. Not someone that is feminine and loves to be curved and simply ‚Äúgirly‚Äù, but not someone who is tough and masculine either. (I do not believe this is only what makes someone male and female, but you get what I‚Äôm trying to say).

When I picture myself using they/them it doesn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable, and it seems to sit well like a puzzle piece being fit into something. She/her never bothered me though, I guess. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had a significant moment with gender dysphoria, but rather euphoria when trying on more ‚Äúnon-binary looking‚Äù outfits. I teared up happily looking at myself for once not being stereotypically female looking, and I loved the fact i for once couldnt visibly appeal as male or female. I do also suddenly feel an urge to erase my chest for the first time in my life. 

But what if I‚Äôm faking it just to be ‚Äúquirky‚Äù? Everyone else I‚Äôve seen has very obvious stories that make it feel right for them from the beginning, since their childhood, but I‚Äôve only thought about it because I had discovered it even after feeling okay for years. I like the thought of being more masculine but not to the extent of being a boy, and there are times I feel feminine too. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm saying exactly, can someone just tell me if I‚Äôm cis or not please? 

When I imagine my friends seeing me as non-binary I get shy or ashamed because even though they may be supportive I wonder ‚Äúwhat if this is wrong and I‚Äôm just trying to pretend? What if they think I‚Äôm lying and am tired of me attention seeking? Would younger me want even this?‚Äù And then I feel numb for a large period of time because I think I‚Äôm just some annoying cis girl trying to be special when there are many who struggle trying to actually be themselves here... 

When I think and feel and just anything in my mind really, I feel like the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù just brings of the feeling of a non-binary person, and I like that. It feels safe and comfortable. But if it were a girls voice I think it might be a little weird.. I know there isn‚Äôt really such thing as a ‚Äúnon-binary voice‚Äù but it just gives that vibe yknow? I‚Äôm my dreams I‚Äôm never pictured as a girl or a guy either. I‚Äôve been happy with that. I don‚Äôt want to change it.

As of this realization I have begun to internally refer to myself as non binary to try things out, and I will admit I became a lot sadder every time my mum would proudly announce ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her girl‚Äù, or that fact that I‚Äôm referred to as a girl by anyone,,, and the fact I have to go to an only girls school every day.

Yet still, I‚Äôm scared to go and physically change myself. I‚Äôd love to cut my hair to stop it from being it‚Äôs ‚Äúlong pretty‚Äù self, but surgeries and stuff seem too underserving and might be a waste of time for everyone around me. What if I‚Äôm just a fool who was just cis all along? I‚Äôm scared for society to view me as ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù despite the many happy people who are non binary and are living their best lives. 

(((I do not think anyone lgbtq+ is abnormal. EVERYONE IS VALID)))

Though I will admit, I am raised very homophobically and therefore also believed that things like gender and sexuality should not be changed for a most of my life.

2020-11-29 20:26:25,k3gl1c,9,1,"Hello everyone! I've been having over the past few days a gender identity crisis. I've been having this constant debate in my head of whether I am non binary or cis and it is really confusing me and distressing me. So I would really love your guy's opinions and thoughts. That could really help me out. I'm sorry if this post is really long. I just have so many thoughts around gender going on right now. If you would read through the whole thing, you have no idea how much I would appreciate it.

(I've separated the text into separate sections to make the words easier to digest)

To give you all some background, for quite a while now I've known that gender is socially constructed and it has led me to envision a world where gender is no longer a concern and people are free to be themselves. This world fills me with joy. I quickly latched onto the idea of gender abolitionism. We could just abolish it. It wouldn't matter.

My whole life I haven't had an issue with gender really. I've never questioned my AFABness simply because I never thought I needed to, I almost thought it was never an option for me as I had never thought that deep about gender. I didn't even know what being non binary was until quite recently. I had heard of it vaguely before. Even once finding out about non binarism I never dared think it would apply to me. I always thought, I'm a girl there's no doubt about it. That's what I've always been identified as others by. I didn't do any introspection into it.

After a lot of TikTok consumption and research into gender, I began to realize wait it's all a social construct anyways, why bother caring about gender? I presented the idea of gender abolitionism to my sisters. They weren't appealed by it. Gender is a large part of their identity as human beings. It wasn't something they were willing to simply give up. But I however, was so willing, so eager to shed my womanness. I didn't care about it. It had no meaning to me. It never has. For my sisters it is a core part of themselves and I am the outlier.

My lack of care for gender even led one of my sisters to ask me, ""Are you a woman?"" I was actually stunned by her words. I was almost paralyzed. There was no obvious answer in my head. I replied shakingly yes so I wouldn't start some uncomfortable conversation but I knew my ""yes"" was empty. It was simply an escape from a question I was scared to answer. Was I a woman? The thing is, I don't know. I really don't know.

The word ""Woman"" has never been something I considered to be a core part of my identity or even really a part of my identity at all. I was quite willing to drop ""woman"" from myself altogether. Am I a woman? Who cares, it is all a social construct. That is what I think in my head. Woman means so little to me that gender abolitionism doesn't feel like it is eating into my identity at all. It feels freeing in a sense not to be considered a woman.

When my sisters have always obsessed over the ""girl boss"" ""women in power"" and ""the future is female"" aesthetic I never felt much comfort or power in those phrases. I am a feminist but I could seemingly never adapt the feminist slogans, looks, feelings, or passion. I could never fully see myself as a woman standing with woman in the woman identity. There always felt like something was missing from my feminist identity and I think it might be that I am not really a woman. Being a woman has never been a part of my identity and I honestly feel like I could go without it.

When I try to think of myself as a woman, I always picture myself externally. I look like a woman. I dress very feminine. I act rather feminine sometimes but also agender at others. I can see the woman on the outside of me but not the inside. I feel almost like there is an absence of gender within me at most or all times. I can't seem to find gender within me. Calling myself a girl or woman feels empty to me. I don't feel them within myself.

I've read and heard that cis people can oftentimes feel their gender. They just somehow know that they are the gender they were born as. That information shocked me. I thought to myself *people can actually feel their genders?* I never have. I couldn't relate. I think about my sister who says being a woman is such an important part of her identity. I can't understand what she means. I don't know what it means to feel like a woman.

When I read about the female experience I can never see myself in it. When my sister would talk about facts about women or women's reproductive systems I felt out of place. When I think about myself as a feminist I never feel like I am a feminist because I am a woman but rather it was the right thing to do and that equality means a lot to me as a concept.

Part of me is saying that I'm faking all this. That I just want to be unique and different. That I'm faking because I don't or barely feel dysphoria. Part of me is saying of course you're a woman, that's what you've always been called. But I can't seem to find any examples of myself embracing the woman identity.

So I guess I am wondering if this sounds like I am enby? I'm really considering it. I'd greatly appreciate it if you left your thoughts below. :) thanks for reading!

I\'ve been having over the past few days a gender identity crisis. I\'ve been having this constant debate in my head of whether I am non binary or cis and it is really confusing me and distressing me. So I would really love your guy\'s opinions and thoughts. That could really help me out. I\'m sorry if this post is really long. I just have so many thoughts around gender going on right now. If you would read through the whole thing, you have no idea how much I would appreciate it.\n\n(I\'ve separated the text into separate sections to make the words easier to digest)\n\nTo give you all some background, for quite a while now I\'ve known that gender is socially constructed and it has led me to envision a world where gender is no longer a concern and people are free to be themselves. This world fills me with joy. I quickly latched onto the idea of gender abolitionism. We could just abolish it. It wouldn\'t matter.\n\nMy whole life I haven\'t had an issue with gender really. I\'ve never questioned my AFABness simply because I never thought I needed to, I almost thought it was never an option for me as I had never thought that deep about gender. I didn\'t even know what being non binary was until quite recently. I had heard of it vaguely before. Even once finding out about non binarism I never dared think it would apply to me. I always thought, I\'m a girl there\'s no doubt about it. That\'s what I\'ve always been identified as others by. I didn\'t do any introspection into it.\n\nAfter a lot of TikTok consumption and research into gender, I began to realize wait it\'s all a social construct anyways, why bother caring about gender? I presented the idea of gender abolitionism to my sisters. They weren\'t appealed by it. Gender is a large part of their identity as human beings. It wasn\'t something they were willing to simply give up. But I however, was so willing, so eager to shed my womanness. I didn\'t care about it. It had no meaning to me. It never has. For my sisters it is a core part of themselves and I am the outlier.\n\nMy lack of care for gender even led one of my sisters to ask me, ""Are you a woman?"" I was actually stunned by her words. I was almost paralyzed. There was no obvious answer in my head. I replied shakingly yes so I wouldn\'t start some uncomfortable conversation but I knew my ""yes"" was empty. It was simply an escape from a question I was scared to answer. Was I a woman? The thing is, I don\'t know.

2020-11-30 05:15:48,k3pfvy,27,1,"Just want to start this off by saying I‚Äôm not trying to attack anyone with preferences when it comes what body parts or anatomy they are attracted to, and that this isn‚Äôt primarily about that. 

I know nonbinary people have different thoughts and feelings re: how they would like their partner(s) to view and interact with their bodies. And it seems quite common for enby‚Äôs to prioritize their partner acknowledging their gender identity, but not mind them being attracted to their bodies in a gendered way that corresponds with the general preference of the partner‚Äôs sexual orientation (e.g. being attracted to ‚Äòfemale‚Äô bodies for lesbians and straight men). And I‚Äôm happy that these enbies are happy, but when I think about this issue in regards to myself, I just feel really uncomfortable with that? 

For background info, I‚Äôm agender (genderless) and AFAB. I don‚Äôt often experience dysphoria but it seems to manifest pretty strongly at the idea that a potential partner may secretly or even openly be attracted to me only because of my proximity to either binary gender. That the only reason they physically find me attractive is because I look like a ‚Äògirl‚Äô or because they find my body attractive because of its female parts. I understand most people, especially cis monosexuals, are only used to thinking about and experiencing attraction in a binary way, because people register to them as either attractive Women‚Ñ¢ or Men‚Ñ¢, or having attractive Women‚Ñ¢ or Men‚Ñ¢ features. And so even with nonbinary people, it can feel like the strongest attraction they feel is to the parts they gender in a binary way, while tolerating the other gender stuff. And that just really bothers me. Again, not because I‚Äôm criticizing anyone else‚Äôs partner, if you‚Äôre happy that‚Äôs all that matters, but more because this just makes me very dysphoric. I would hate to feel gendered in that way by my partner. I don‚Äôt deny my sex is female, and I‚Äôm not at all trying to shame people who like female body parts because they primarily associate them with women, but I‚Äôm not a woman and I would hate to feel like my partner only liked those parts because they were unconsciously or consciously making that association. Having a partner intellectually acknowledge that I‚Äôm nonbinary and have that not fully reflect in their attraction to me (instead ‚Äòtreating‚Äô me like a woman) makes me dysphoric. Having partners only be attracted to me if I fit into the narrow confines of a binary gendered presentation makes me dysphoric. I‚Äôm wondering whether it‚Äôs even possible for me to find someone who loves me and my body without immediately gendering them, or at the very least, without gendering them in a binary way. If they don't do this it feels like they're saying '‚ÄòI respect that you think you are nonbinary, but in all the ways that count I see you as a woman and like the parts of you that I experience as belonging to a woman‚Äô.
