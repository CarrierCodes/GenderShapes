I have two cousins that I’m close with, recently I’ve gotten particularly close with the younger one because she is also apart LGBTQ+ community so I relate to her and we talk about our sexualities. She accidentally came out to her older sister and she managed to slip in the question of what her opinions on non binary people are. Turns out, not good. 

She said how it’s dumb and that they/them is only plural, and to quote what she told my cousin after stating this ‘don’t you bring any of those crazy’s home’.

My friends are trying their best but honestly they don’t understand any of what I’m feeling. I was talking to two of them about my binder and one said that ‘at least you won’t need it because your at home’ and that actually hurt, because it’s not like my gender dysphoria just goes away the minute I walk in the door to my house.

Hi everyone!

So, I took me a very long time before having the courage to post my question here. Not sure if it's because I was afraid of being judged or just scared that the answers might not please me.

I came out as trans like 9 month ago. At first, I was convinced I was a girl. Yet with time, some things got in my way and it made me think : do I really want to be a girl? I've always felt like I wasn't a boy, but not *really* a girl neither. Most I could imagine is being a masculine girl. But lately, I've been wondering about non-binarity. And the more I think of it, the more it seems like an answer.

I don't want to make any definitive choice here. I want to explore the possibility of being non binary, and if it isn't enough, I'll explore the possibility of being a woman. 

All this to say : I feel very uncomfortable in my skin right now. Beard, body hair, masculine facial features, no curves... It just doesn't feel *right*. So I'm thinking of HRT. I have an appointment with an endo, yet I don't know her and I'm afraid to not know what to say (I tend to be very anxious around people). So I wanted to know, if any of you is under a low dosage HRT and what does it bring to you? And more, if I think it isn't enough and want a higher dosage, would the fact I was under low dose before change anything?

Not sure if it's because I was afraid of being judged or just scared that the answers might not please me.\n\nI came out as trans like 9 month ago. At first, I was convinced I was a girl. Yet with time, some things got in my way and it made me think : do I really want to be a girl? I've always felt like I wasn't a boy, but not *really* a girl neither. Most I could imagine is being a masculine girl. But lately, I've been wondering about non-binarity. And the more I think of it, the more it seems like an answer.\n\nI don't want to make any definitive choice here. I want to explore the possibility of being non binary, and if it isn't enough, I'll explore the possibility of being a woman. \n\nAll this to say : I feel very uncomfortable in my skin right now. Beard, body hair, masculine facial features, no curves... It just doesn't feel *right*. So I'm thinking of HRT. I have an appointment with an endo, yet I don't know her and I'm afraid to not know what to say (I tend to be very anxious around people). So I wanted to know, if any of you is under a low dosage HRT and what does it bring to you? And more, if I think it isn't enough and want a higher dosage, would the fact I was under low dose before change anything? \n\nRight now, I want to aim for a more andro look, I've already started with clothes, shaving the beard, letting my hair grow.

2020-04-04 03:11:03,fumbxn,4,1,"Hey y'all. This is gonna be kind of rambly so get ready lol. I'm a lesbian and I think I've known in the back of my head for awhile that I'm not totally a woman - basically the phrase ""I'm not a woman, I'm a lesbian"" sums up a lot of my feelings towards my gender. Since it was such a loose association with being NB I never really told anyone because it wasn't like I had to physically or socially transition. However, recently I've been reconsidering my pronouns. 

I notice that I struggle with calling myself ""she"", ""girl"", ""queen"", ""daughter"", or anything gendered like that. Like, when I'm talking and I come to a point in a sentence where I have to refer to myself, there's this mental pause where I want to continue with ""person"" or ""insert neutral term here"", and if I do choose a gendered term I sort of cringe internally. I've even retyped texts to avoid using any term for myself. I don't notice as often when other people are talking about me, but I've definitely felt discomfort with being called ""she"" before (and with this one professor who insists on calling everyone Mr. or Miss Lastname). So because of all this, I think ""they"" is what seems to be the right option, or maybe a mixture of she and they. It's hard to test it out to be sure under the current circumstances, though. I did post on TransTryouts but it's hard to tell if new pronouns sound wrong or just new for now. 

Honestly, I think some of my uncertainty comes from the fact that my entire friend group is trans/NB and I have this fear of somehow diminishing their experiences. I don't feel uncomfortable in the women's bathroom, I don't have any dysphoria - I've just always been the ""cis"" one in the group. And I'm also afraid that maybe I'm making it all up and I just subconsciously want to fit in with them better by pretending we have shared experiences.

I've been worried about this for a bit because it seems like I hardly ever have a hard masc period anymore, and when I do, they only last an hour or so.  I'm basically living in a bra now whether I have forms in or not.  Feels so wrong without it.

Then just now, I was crushed by the realization that I didn't get to breastfeed my two sons.  Zero fetish or anything going on here.  I just am in pain because I didn't get to connect with them in that way and experience that deep, physical bond.  The thing that comforts me is that I did get to syringe feed my first kid for the first month because he couldn't figure out how to latch.  My pinkie was the only ""nipple"" he could figure out.

- very overweight, but small-ish breasts
- facial hair, chest and stomach hair
- attracted to masc individuals

I want to go on T for these reasons: deeper voice, more masculine frame, more beard, bottom growth

However I'm very conflicted about body hair. I already have a lot of it, and some of it I like (arm hair, leg hair, facial hair) but I don't think I'd like to get MORE hair everywhere else

I want to get rid of my breasts, but my body shape and general physical form means I can't really bind

I'm not out socially, but my friends know and use my chosen name, parts of my family knows but use my birthname and have expressed confusion about it.

2020-04-09 01:29:54,fxj94g,7,5,"I've struggled for a long time about whether I'm non binary or just don't like gender roles. I've explored different areas of this, like pronouns. I like they/them fine but I'm also usually ok with my agab pronouns. The things I don't like are gendered terms (E.g. Woman, lady, wife,  Ms - which is funny since I'm a teacher... Ha). I also have a LOT of issues with my chest, and I'm approved for a reduction whenever Covid allows it. I feel like I have a lot of symptoms of dysphoria and would like to say I'm non binary but I go back and forth and worry about how to explain to people and worry I just have internalized feelings about gender norms. It's safe to say I don't know what the hell I am.


Anyway, unrelated to this I've started to wonder if I have PCOS (for many other reasons) but due to everything being closed down where I live I can't be tested/treated currently. So in the mean time, I decided to go to planned parenthood and take out my IUD and go back to the pill since oral BC is a common treatment for PCOS. This has led to me having my first period/bleeding in like 3-4 years and it's been really traumatic. It feels so completely wrong to have this happening. It's out of place and makes me feel disconnected with my body. And while I know you don't need dysphoria or anything to be trans, somehow it does make me feel better about calling myself non binary, like I'm giving myself permission. (again I totally know being NB is not predicated on anything, I'm just a really self - doubting person in general). It does raise a new host of questions for myself about if it changes what I want for pronouns, what labels I think I may want, and how I view myself. And all that aside from how my coming out would affect my wife. Sorry for the long rant. Just figuring my shit out and wanted a sounding board, I guess.

But i started hating my body and stuff and fell into an ED pretty badly for seemingly no reason that i could figure out. Over the summer of 8th grade i got outted to my parents and they found out about me being gay and had found things i had written about questioning my gender.

2020-04-17 00:50:48,g2rqem,8,20,"So overall I’m not that self conscious about my body, I’m AFAB and I don’t think I would want to change my breasts, my curves, and even my genitalia (even though I wouldn’t change it, it still looks weird to me, but I don’t know if it’s because that stuff just looks weird or what). This is one of the reasons why I’m not sure if I’m Enby or not, because I don’t experience that much dysphoria.

That being said, when I do experience dysphoria, it‘s more related to shaving and my hairstyle then anything else. When I started growing more hair on my body I never felt the need to shave it, it made me feel less delicate and feminine. Luckily I have quite a bit of hair and it grows pretty easily, but my mom is constantly telling me that I need to shave my armpits and I really hate having to do that because I hate how it looks and it’s a hassle.

I also feel a bit self conscious about my face and how my cheeks are very big and pronounced, and they tend to blush pretty easily and for no reason. For a while I thought it was because it made me look like a kid but I think it might be because it makes me look more feminine. I’m also worried about my breasts getting bigger, as they tend to run big in my family. Female pronouns don’t bother me, but I like sir better then ma’am and things of that nature. Like being called dad over mom if I have kids, and things like that.

2020-04-19 01:28:12,g3z4lk,3,5,"i’m gonna rant about my ignorant sister

i recently figured out for myself that i am non-binary and i am not out to my family, only two of my friends and the internet

my family is super supportive of the lgbtq community (for the most part). i’m out to my family as a lesbian and everything is good. my mom even trains social workers and foster parents on the community, so she is very supportive and understanding. however, my sister is not so much.

my sister is supportive of being gay, bi, lesbian, and ftm or mtf trans. but she believes that there are only 2 genders. male or female, penis or vagina, xx or xy. that’s it. i’ve tried to tell her that she’s wrong but she won’t listen. i even sent her an instagram post about intersex people. she opened it and never responded. when i asked her why she said “sometimes i don’t respond to things for a reason” i asked if she even read it and she said no because she doesn’t believe that. she even said “i respect your opinion so you should respect mine”. the post had stats about intersex people and stuff. 

that’s not opinions, that’s facts and science. she is ignorant and won’t even listen to what i’m telling her. she won’t even see the facts about intersex people, never mind non-binary people.

it hurts me because she makes me feel invisible and like my feelings aren’t real. and yes, i’m not out to my family, but my cousin is non-binary and out to the entire family.

my sister and my brother still use their old pronouns and their dead name. my mom uses their new name, as well as my aunt who is their grandma. my mom still sometimes messes up and uses their dead name and i correct her when she does, and i get that it’s tough in the beginning. but even my mom, who is super supportive, doesn’t use they them pronouns for them. everyone in my family messes up their pronouns and i always correct them.

my cousin is currently living with their mom who has many mental illnesses, their dad is trying to get custody of them and their sister, but with corona it’s been really hard and both kids are super traumatized from their mom. because of their immense trauma, therapists and family believe that it is possible that being non-binary is a form of multiple personality disorder. even if that’s true, my family should still respect their name and pronouns, but they don’t. 

all of this hurts me, and hurts because my cousin is constantly getting misgendered and dead named by their family. my sister is the worst in all of this because she doesn’t believe that non-binary people are real. every time she says something about there only being 2 genders, it breaks me more and more because i feel like i’ll never be able to come out. my cousin is younger than me by a few years and they are already so much braver. i wish i were as brave as them. i know my mom will support me if i come out, but i love my sister and i know she will just ignore it. 

i’m scared that my sister will never respect me, call me by whatever name i chose, and use they them pronouns for me. even if she does when i’m present, i don’t think she will when i’m not there. and i don’t think my family would correct her. i don’t think anyone in my family would correct anyone else. even my mom because she doesn’t call my cousin by the right pronouns and sometimes name.

i’m just really scared. i’m really hurt by my sister. i would take any advice that y’all have. in a small conservative town, i should be used to this, however im still hurt by it. and because of the support i got when i came out as a lesbian, i thought i would be fine with being non-binary too. i shouldn’t have overestimated my family like that, but i did. 

sorry this was really long, but i have no one to talk to about all of this. thank you for letting me get it off my chest (like i wish i could get these titties off my chest) ((terrible joke but i needed to lighten my own mood))

2020-04-19 22:54:38,g4h9ga,3,1,"This got way to long I'm sorry.

Okay I don't really know where to start so maybe some basic information about me first?: I'm 19, bisexual and pretty much always thought of myself as a cis-gender girl but lately I started questioning my gender so here I am.

 Yeah well about 10 month ago I cut off my hair and ever since I have short hair I get confused with a boy from time to time and I really don't mind it. I actually kind of enjoy it? Idk I'm just kind of happy to bee seen that way and I don't really get it. 

I never was the tipical girly girl growing up. Like there was a time as a kid when for like a week or two I hid my hair under a hat called myself Max and told everyone I'm a boy. I was about 5 at time and I stopped pretty fast when the kids started bullying me because of it. But still I always enjoyed playing with the boys more, always wanted to be a boy character while playing and my future dream job was knight, you get the gist. 

I was bullied quite a bit as kid because of all of this and especially cause I insisted on wearing boys clothes and having a blue school bagpack with cars on it (this was really the thing I was bullied most for: my fucking bagpack. You cannot imagine what horrible things theses kids said about it and me because of it). Kids are fucking cruel so as I got older I started hiding all of this a lot better and ""acted more like a girl"" but I still never wanted to wear dresses or do ""girls activities"" like doing make-up or something I just always felt so wrong doing things like that. 

I guess all of this sounds pretty much like I'm a trans boy/man (whatever at 19 I really don't know what fits better boy or man? Girl or woman? Confusing shit) and I considered it for a while but I don't feel like I'm male and I don't really mind being perceived as a girl most of the time. Idk I got no problem with my name or being called she/her but I got no problem with being called he/him either. 

I just don't feel very attached to either gender so I thought maybe I'm nonbinary? But I don't think I'm feeling disphoric neither phisical nor social. Like I said I don't mind being perceived as a girl most of the time and I don't really have a problem with my body most of the time either (I mean that's kind of a lie I always have problems with my body but not like that). But than again I'd really like to have broader shoulders and some days less hips and sometimes I wish I didn't have breasts. But like just some days most of the days it's fine and even when not it's never a terrible feeling of ""this is wrong"" but more like ""it would be nice if"" so I really don't know. 

I'm not really sure what I want to accomplish with this rant. Maybe that someone could tell me if I could be nonbinary? Like I know you can't just tell me what I identify at, you're not me but some personal experience would be kinda nice? If it's not a too personal thing to ask about idk I'm sorry if it is. 

Ahh I'm just very fucking confused, I never thought about gender much it was just never a big part of my identity cause I never really felt attached to being a girl you know? But I don't feel like a boy either so it's all very fucking strange. Maybe I am just a cis-girl and everyone feels this way idk. Thank you to everyone who even read this way to long text and I apologize that  it is kind of a mess. 

If someone actually comments I apologize that I won't reply for a while but I really have to go to sleep now I have to be up in 3 hours and working in 4.

Like I said I don\'t mind being perceived as a girl most of the time and I don\'t really have a problem with my body most of the time either (I mean that\'s kind of a lie I always have problems with my body but not like that). But than again I\'d really like to have broader shoulders and some days less hips and sometimes I wish I didn\'t have breasts. But like just some days most of the days it\'s fine and even when not it\'s never a terrible feeling of ""this is wrong"" but more like ""it would be nice if"" so I really don\'t know. \n\nI\'m not really sure what I want to accomplish with this rant. Maybe that someone could tell me if I could be nonbinary? Like I know you can\'t just tell me what I identify at, you\'re not me but some personal experience would be kinda nice? If it\'s not a too personal thing to ask about idk I\'m sorry if it is. \n\nAhh I\'m just very fucking confused, I never thought about gender much it was just never a big part of my identity cause I never really felt attached to being a girl you know? But I don\'t feel like a boy either so it\'s all very fucking strange. Maybe I am just a cis-girl and everyone feels this way idk. Thank you to everyone who even read this way to long text and I apologize that  it is kind of a mess. \n\nIf someone actually comments I apologize that I won\'t reply for a while but I really have to go to sleep now I have to be up in 3 hours and working in 4.

I didn't know people could like the same-sex, I never thought it was even possible, I remember wacthing a wrestling match one time and feeling rather a strange maybe embarrassment but at the same time I was  uncomfortable?

To give you an slightly morbid idea of when I figured out gay people were a thing, I didn't learn that people like me existed when same sex marriage became legal in the U.S. I learned when PULSE happened. It was such a big thing my freinds were talking about it. My parents couldn't hide it from me anymore. Not a fun experience.

I learned alot and I went from far right to far left a couple years ago, after I realized, yikes my church hates me for being gay I'll choose my basic human actions over a religious belief, and it just snowballed from there.


Ok here's the not backstory part


I figured out I like people regardless of sex or gender a while ago, I'm still closed, but not a school, I'm very open and confident there.


I realized I was non-binary for almost a year now. I felt so nice feeling like I wasn't a male not a female. It felt like this feeling of alienation when I had to do ""manly things"" even things what are traditionally masculine like video games can just felt so weird because it was such a male dominated area, I play video games now and go to game and sim. Class at my school cause in play Minecraft and animal crossing with other Queer kids. I also wanna try DND.

But I don't know if it's just me being an extremely femminine guy, or if I'm genuinely non-binary.... is what my dysphoria saids when it's not even trying to make me feel bad.i feel so out of place, it felt like a few months ago I had such euphoria knowing what role to be in society, know I feel like I just want to get bottom surgery and remove all my facial hair, right now in just too tiered to deal with my dysphoria, I have a pefferd name but I go by my name given at birth because I don't feel like I look androgynous, which makes sense cause I'm closeted it fucking hurts, I hate this, I hate being like this, it's like every time I'm closer to experiencing being me, in stopped by the one problem in my life that I will never solve, being closeted. like I don't have proper etiquette, I'm lazy ,I play video games and eat all day, and I'm a hairy dude,almost everything about me is masculine. And I hate it.

Hi! So I am cis-female so not sure if this is allowed, but I can't think of a more fitting sub for this question. 

My best friend in the world is non-binary. I love them, they mean the world to me, we've been friends for almost 20 years. 

I am jumping the gun here- I'm not engaged yet. But my very serious boyfriend just recently asked what kind of engagement ring I would like and asked me to send him pictures. Also, I've just been browsing a wedding horror story sub reddit and now the topic of inconsiderate brides is on my mind. 

It got me thinking-- how would I ask them to be my maid of honor? I've read stuff saying people of used ""friend of honor"" but that sounds so... impersonal? informal? idk something about rubs me the wrong way. 

They do present very femme but have also started taking hormones to make them more masculine. I'm
about 200% sure they would wear a dress to a wedding anyway, so attire isn't really an issue. It's more of just the title. I would just ask them what they prefer but I don't wanna ruin the surprise! I was one of those cute proposals where you give them a cupcake and balloon and there's a pun asking them to be in the wedding party. 

Is ""friend of honor"" really the best way to go? Do you think they'd get offended if I just kept the title of ""maid of honor?""

2020-04-20 14:50:58,g4u6cn,1,1,"I was born female, and to be honest didn’t spend the majority of my life questioning my gender. When I was younger (elementary and early/mid high school) I was incredibly uncomfortable with the idea of wearing female clothes, I straight up would not do so. I always consciously wished I was born male, because I felt so much more comfortable around boys, in their clothes, with their bodies, etc. For the majority of my life, I never questioned it because I thought “oh you were just a tomboy!”.

As afab masc identifying nonbinary person, who is bi, I often feel out of place and uncomfortable, like I was an unwanted intruder, when using dating apps catered to mainly gay women (Her) or gay cis men (Grindr). 

Of course I've tried tinder, and other popular queer apps, and while I've met few lovely people, I constantly crash on being perceived as some binary gender that other people want to see me as.

I just worry that I won't be seen on either of these apps as the person that I truly am, and truth be told, most days it makes me want to give up on trying and dating altogether.

Does anyone have a similar experience? How do you cope with it?

I'm not sure what to do in regards to my friend who recently told me he was NonBinary (but chooses to go by male pronouns). I'm sorry if I come across as insensitive but I don't know who to turn to and just need advice because I'm scared for my friend.

I've been very good friends with a guy (we'll call him James) for many years. We've been through a lot together, both good and bad. We play games, watch movies, tell bad jokes and share drinks and philosophical discussions. And we've supported each other during the dark periods of our lives. I suffer from severe depression/anxiety and he's talked me down from more than one panic attack. And while I haven't been perfect at it, I've supported him as best I can.

James is a good person. He's a premed student because he wants to help people, volunteering as an paramedic when he can (although he stopped because of COVID-19 and having parents with severe health problems and he doesn't want to risk their health and safety). One time, when my apartment had been broken into and my laptop stolen, he offered me money to replace it. That's just the type of person he is...and I love him dearly for it.

That's not to say that he's perfect. Far from it. James has a bad drinking problem, uses drugs and goes on spending sprees. To deal with his problems, he uses distraction. I've used distraction myself...but he does it to a degree that I would call unhealthy. I sometimes wonder if he's in denial.

James has been questioning his gender identity for a while and even wondered if he was transgender. I did suggest to him ""Why don't you get through this semester first?"" (he was having a particularly rough semester when he was wondering if he was transgender, which made me think his questioning was a distraction). He agreed and I heard nothing more of it.

Well, a few days ago, James called me and told me that he was NonBinary. I was one of the first he told because I'm one of the few people he trusts absolutely and he considers me one of his closest friends.

I should be happy for him. I really should be. But I'm not.

You know that feeling you have in your gut when something's not right but you can't put your finger on it? That's what I had when he told me. I told him I was glad for him...but I was lying through my teeth.

I spent the past few days reflecting about why James' news worried me and it wasn't until I was driving home this afternoon when it hit me.

I'm scared this is another distraction. I'm scared that once the novelty wears off, he'll be right back where he started, or even worse off.

Maybe I need to get used to the idea...and if his accepting his NonBinary status is the start to recovery from his other demons, then so be it...but I'm worried that he's just using this as another way to distract himself from the pain.

Fortunately, he's started seeing a therapist specializing in LGTB+ issues. And I've promised that I would support him no matter what.

However...I don't know how to bring up my fears about this being another distraction from all of the problems going on in his life. I don't want him to think one of his closest friends is rejecting him. But I'm scared that he's going down a path that I can't follow.

I'm sorry for rambling and sounding like I'm insensitive...but I love my friend and I don't want to see him destroy himself. I've already seen two loved ones destroy themselves.

So...how can I tell James about my fears without making him feel like I'm rejecting him?

2020-04-21 09:27:39,g5c3xw,2,1,"33 y/o transmasc nonbinary. I've had these thoughts rattling around in my head for some weeks now, and felt I wanted to share them to get some input. Please don't see this as an attack, rather just hoping to hear your views on it.

I feel like I see a lot of rethorics in which being non binary is somehow equated to being some sort of less intense version of being binary trans. I don't think any of the people are writing this is with the intent of invalidating non binary identities, but I'm just tired of it. Things like ""I'm not sure if I'm binary trans, so I went with NB instead as it seemed like less work"" or the likes. I'm sure it's true in those cases, but man, I fucking wish I was binary trans instead of non binary so that people could take me from one known category and put me in another known category, instead of being put in some limbo that no one has any frame of reference for, trying to persuade everyone around me to change a very fundamental part of their language to use a neo pronoun (I'm not in an English speaking country) and being seen as someone who's just doing this for attention. I feel like had I just been a trans man my situation would've been easier.

Similarly when I started questioning a year ago I had much help from the Reddit trans communities, especially the Hatchery discord. Much cred to those people volunteering their time and energy to helping people come to terms with their identities, but I feel that that was also very focused on binary trans identities. There was a lot of talk about the button experiment, a very valuable thought experiment, but with the obvious downside that non binary identities don't exist in most if its incarnations. When posed the question if I would press a button to having been born a man instead of a woman my answer was no, which then means I'm not trans according to this experiment. Yet I hate being a woman, will search out HRT and surgeries as soon as I can and for as long as I can remember I've wanted a penis and a beard. But I'm not a man, something I've tried to persuade myself that I am, that I'm just in denial etc. I'm also equally certain that I'm not a woman. Had there been a button experiment in which there was a non binary button, a body which had my particular flavour of preferences, I would've thrown myself on it with all my might.

I just feel like it halted my feelings of validity, despite the millions of posts about nb folx being valid and never having encountered any outright invalidation from binary trans people on these subs. But it wasn't until some weeks ago that it dawned on me that my own transition is just as intense and trying and all as that of a binary trans person. Comparing suffering isn't constructive, and I know you don't have to experience dysphoria to be trans, but I've felt that my own suffering wasn't as valid as that of a binary trans person. Me desperately wanting a dick seemed less valid than a trans man feeling that. I guess my epiphany was that transgender, in its very definition, means not being the gender you were assigned at birth.

2020-04-21 09:48:33,g5cbyq,6,1,"Hey everyone! I’m not sure if this belongs here but I just want to see if anyone has any idea about what I’m going through. 

So I’m queer and nonbinary (afab). I am more attracted to girls than guys, and although I have never gotten a massive crush, I really love fictional characters, and use them as a coping mechanism for my mental illnesses and being queer. In real life, I find almost every girl I see attractive, and maybe 1 in 50 guys attractive. Nb people vary a lot. Weirdly, sometimes I really attach myself onto one male fictional character or real-life male actor to the point I cannot stop thinking about them. Lately, I have realised the guys I am attracted to are generally feminine-looking or androgynous-looking imo, whether they are real or fictional (for example, I’m super into Timothée Chalamet right now). However, I find that I am not attracted to heaps of photos or vids of this guy that are supposed to be “hot”; specifically, the masculine ones. I can’t relate to heaps of the cis girl fans that want to be topped by these celebs or characters, or that are attracted to their muscular or facial hair. I don’t find muscle-y men or facial hair attractive AT ALL and whenever a guy actor I am attracted to looks too masculine, my attraction to them instantly dies off. 

In any case, this guy I attach onto is all I can think of for like a month, then I drop them. My attraction to them just dies out of nowhere, and I’m only attracted to women for a while. I also get short waves of thinking I have a crush on someone irl and going to make a move, then I leave it alone for like a week and it’s completely gone.

Also, even though I am super drawn to feminine/androgynous guys in a romantic/sexual way, after about two weeks, I am no longer sexually attracted to them. At all. This doesn’t happen with women I’m attracted to. This concerns me bc I’m scared that I won’t find a partner; A) I have never truly liked someone, and B) my attraction to people (boys in particular) dies very fast and I find myself only sexually attracted to women. But, I’m sure that I still like boys because I am attracted to certain boys (mainly fictional ones/actors)!!!! Every time this happens, I really want the attraction to last, because I feel like it’s my fault when my attraction dies. Sometimes I think I will never get over them but I always do. 

I don’t know if this is normal??? I’m in my late teens, but I seriously have never gotten a massive crush ever. I’ve only had two crushes but they’ve been pretty minor, and both on girls. I’m wondering if I’m just super lonely (I am a massive introvert but I’m constantly miserable/lonely and although I’ve never been anything close to in love, I find myself wanting to love someone) or if I’m projecting onto these guys because I want to look/appear more masculine as a nonbinary person?? I do feel invalid as a nonbinary person sometimes because I am closeted and look quite feminine. I am also very jealous of the female attention these men get bc not that many women are attracted to me.

I guess the point of all this is to ask if anyone can relate or give advice?? I’m super scared I will die alone— I know it’s drastic but I’m still worried. I have never been in a relationship, and I’ve only been on one date with a chick that I “broke up” with because I found that —although the date was good, she’s cute, and we get along together— I didn’t actually have a crush on her. I don’t want to fall out of love or upset future partners because I find that I don’t love them anymore. Is this just a phase?? Do I even like guys?? Has anyone gone through this??

Thank you for reading and massive thanks for helping me out if you can. I know it sounds super stupid and I’m bad at explaining it, but it really upsets me super often. It causes me HEAPS of stress.

Ciel Fledge, a Daughter Raising Sim
Available on Steam
- this game is still in progress if the Steam page can be believed, but you can get the game now to try it out for yourself. It is a fun, little parenthood sim where you watch Ciel go to school and hang out with friends. There is also a deeper story hiding behind everything, but the game is simple for the most part and easy to loose track of time playing. You have the option to name yourself whatever you want and to have the title of Mx. There are also some nonbinary characters in the story, and the world seems very accepting of enbies!


Solo: Islands of the Heart
Available on Steam and Nintendo Switch
- This game is a cute, meditative puzzle game focusing on love and past relationships. It is very much a “write your own story” game and features options for you to be a nonbinary character with a male, female, or enby partner. There are also hints to poly relationships as an option to think about. It’s a neat adventure, though the block puzzles may be difficult for people that aren’t spacially-inclined and have trouble with depth perception. 


Later Daters
New on Steam
- This is a new game out on Steam; only the first chapter is out so far. It is colorful and reminiscent of Dream Daddy in its colorful cast. In this game, you play as a senior moving into an active/assisted living community. Like Solo Islands, you can identify as nonbinary and have a nonbinary partner as your new or previous love interest. An interesting feature of this game is that the playable character is a POC. 


Metaware High School (Demo)
Free on Itch.io
- A quirky game constantly breaking the fourth wall, this “demo” (possibly full?) game interacts with the player, who can choose their pronouns. Very silly, sometimes unsettling, the game features a colorful cast of eye-less cuties. Aspen is nonbinary, and Hope is lesbian. It’s a fun time just messing with the cast and seeing their goofy reactions to things. While a commentary on gameplay and visual novels, it isn’t as dark as DDLC or anything, so it’s just a fun game to escape to. 


Honorable Mentions...


Death and Taxes
Available on Steam
- Ever wanted to be a grim reaper? Well, now you can! Suit up for your office job as a new grim and watch as tragic events and intriguing lives unfold a world apart. This is part of the list because every human is referred to neutrally as “they” no matter what. So, it’s a very immersive and validating experience... that’s how I felt, anyway. 


Wandering Wolf Trick
Free on Itch.io
- There are many fun indie games getting into the LGBTQIA scene, but this one is by far the cutest. An anthropomorphized wolf named Trick leaves town to look for their friend, Treat. (Yes, Trick and Treat how cute is that). This is one of the games in the series that focuses on various characters and their (gay) relationships with each other. Trick is very relateable to those of us with self-esteem troubles and a bit of wanderlust. I found their story very bittersweet and cute.

The whoooole story:
I was dating a guy when I was 16, we were in the same class, the relationship lasted 8 months (I broke up because he was so manipulative (not bad guy, just had a lot of emotionally problems). We had the same friends so I didn't want to make them  choose so we still met as a friends. After some months I realized that he wasn't acting like a friend, he was trying to be around me  a lot (and I mean A LOT).
After sometime my group dissolved and I stayed with two friends and he stay with the other one... All went well except for one thing... He still texted me from time to time.

Now we are getting to the point: I started meeting a boy, and he discovered. During that time he was flirting a bit by WhatsApp (I have to say, since the group dissolved we wasn't had watch each others... But he was still texting). So, when he discovered that I was dating someone he start acting weird, he was jealous and asking me that if we were friends I had to trust him and tell those kind of things. In that point I sent this: we are not friends, please don't text me again... I tried to explain to you softly but I couldn't.
And his reply was a loooooong message telling why he hated me, after that I blocked him.

I hope that someone answer me, please I don't know what to do exactly, maybe I have to forgive him and give him a third chance.

Recently I’ve been contemplating if I’m non-binary in some way. I have a ton of friends who identify as non-binary, and seeing them using their preferred pronouns makes me really happy and kind of... jealous? in a way? I was reading a lot of stuff on the internet about non-binary identities, and I came across the term “cis by default” and I honestly have never identified with something more.
