I'm having such a bad heart day. I have recently started slowly coming out as nonbinary. I came out to my partner, a couple of friends, my boss, my sister already sort of knew.... I've been sort of going between non binary and gender fluid in my heart. Not sure which one is right, right now. I've been slowly switching to they/them pronouns.

 I've been having these massive panic attacks for a few weeks. Like every day almost, which isn't totally typical for me, and a somewhat constant heightened sense of anxiety that has come with that. I always have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. And panic attacks. But not this bad. They came after an adjustment in medication but haven't gone away.  

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I feel extremely dysphoric about everything. I don't feel like a boy. I don't feel like a girl. I don't feel nonbinary.

I hope nobody takes this personally. These are internalized feelings, and not feelings I have for other trans or queer people.

 I feel like a traitor to myself as a feminist, even though logically I know that you can 100% be a feminist and be any gender. I feel like a traitor to the little girl I thought I was. I feel like a disappointment to my mother, and my dad, who is dead and who will never have a say, and who's words (supporting or otherwise) I will never know. I feel like I'm losing a part of who I am. I guess I feel like I am grieving, in a way.

Are these transphobic thoughts to be having of myself, or is it just good old self hatred? I don't think that other trans/nonbinary/queer people are traitors, and have never felt that way or had that thought about myself or anyone until today. I'm just feeling so awful and I don't know where this is coming from.

I don't have a hard time using the women's bathroom.

 I don't always feel like they/them works for me. I don't think she/her works me either, but neither does her/him, or ze/zir, or fae/faer, or any of the other pronouns so I don't know what to do.

Today, I feel like a fake.

I don't remember having a lot of dysphoria as a child. I don't remember feeling especially like a girl, or a boy. I remember being sad when people mistook me for a boy all the time, but I think that's because my friends bullied me about it, and everyone bullied me about it. 

I don't know if I had a lot of dysphoria until the last couple of years, and even then, I don't know that I associated it with my gender until I tried on my first binder. It was that moment that I realized what had been going on. I've always been this way, but it has never really felt like a big deal, which is making me feel like a big fake or something. It's hard to explain. 

I've been coming out to myself for close to a year before saying anything to it about anyone out loud. I don't know why these doubts are happening now, right after coming out.

I think maybe it's important to mention that my partner hasn't been super supportive, and that has made all of this really hard. I have felt like a burden. He seems to think that having to change the way he refers to me is a huge inconvenience. He's getting better, but it's making things really hard.

2020-12-03 09:17:21,k5tzux,0,1,"Im a little more comfortable in my gender recently.
I go by a few labels for many reasons tho.

My AGAB is female, but even as a kid i thought i was supposed to be born a boy but i turned out to be a girl somehow and my 3 to 4 year old self accepted and was comfortable with that.
It wasnt till i heard about gender fluid at 14 that i started to question again. But i knew gender fluid didnt quite describe me either.  I never really felt like one gender or another at once. I later realise at 19 that im demigendered, where i feel like some of each gender and i felt more like female and non binary and sometimes male. I didn't want to explain to people what i had learned. I only told my partner.

Now at 24, i identify more with the term genderqueer or nonbinary but usually go by my AGAB because its easier to deal with people. (But when i can or feel its relevant, i put nonbinary as my gender on forms) Im not really out yet. I also don't mind she/her pronouns, but im fine with they/them and he/him (though im never called male pronouns since i dont really pass as masculine).

I still feel demi with my gender but its settled a bit more. I have experienced dysphoria before but it was occasional and usually only upsetting when my breasts would go up a size.  I usually would accept my size later on but i also like to hid my breasts and since im a small person, its easy to do with big shirts and  layers.
I  never experienced Euphoria or dysmorphia until this past summer where i wished my breasts weren't there but i dont always feel this way about my breasts.

I didnt understand why i was so excited about this and i started to question my gender again (thats when i started to identify with genderqueer more). Later on i started to feel like my breasts shouldn't be there after seeing them so flat. I was confused to say the least so i did research and soul searching.

So im still figuring things out i guess. Ive started to come out of the closed and i tell people im genderqueer/nonbinary (together in that fashion) but i say they can still call me with female pronouns.  I will also still refer to myself as female and call myself a woman but im started to feel less comfortable with it. But it doesnt upset me to refer to myself that way. But sometimes i feel like im lying. Im not sure.

 Idk the pronouns dont bother me no matter what im called. This is why i decided on genderqueer. But anyone who really wants to know or understand or are open to my experiences will hear my story.

‘It’s fine if you don’t want to be a girly girl, there are many women who don’t fit into that type’

My name's Kato and I've known I wasn't cis since I was 16 or 17, when my friend and I bound our chests as a joke and it gave me an intense wave of gender euphoria (so much so that even as a less educated ally, i knew something was definitely up). Before then I never liked my breasts or people acknowledging their existence, but I chocked that up to not wanting sexual attention at such a young age. 

Basically I've never enjoyed my breasts nor do I plan on having kids in order to breastfeed, so they're literally useless. Some days they feel like tumors, and they rarely feel like they belong on my body. Soem days they're just...there, not negative but usually not positive either. Ever since I found out about top surgery, I wanted to have it. But now that I'm older (23) and I'll be more able to have access to such a surgery, I'm starting to wonder if thats really what I want. 

It'd be nice to have a flat chest but I'm scared to have it because of the fear of regret and rejection. 1.) I'm not out to my family and I never planned to be, and while I've worn my binder around them without them saying anything about it (I have small boobs anyways so they may have not noticed), its not exactly a quick surgery that i can recover from in a few days, and it would be nice to have some support from them even though I most likely wouldn't get it. 
2.) I've only been able to see myself sexually as a female bodied person, and while every other aspect of my life would be improved, I'm scared that I wouldn't be attractive to people or myself without the boobs. Don't get me wrong, I don't like them on myself. But when you're with a monosexual partner, it can be frightening to change such a drastic part of yourself that you know they would rather you keep. 

I guess I'm just wondering, does any other enby have that issue, where they want to have top surgery but are scared they won't like what the see afterwards?

2020-12-04 23:09:22,k6vw7u,1,2,"Hi, I'm new here. I've been trying to figure out my gender identity and am running into some confusion. At this point I'm not really sure if I whether I am a man with gender expression that falls into femme/gender non-conforming category, or I am non-binary and am just embracing femme presentation because it's how I feel I can distance myself from presenting male. 

I don't know if I truly experience dysphoria, I do wish I had more feminine traits but I don't outright hate my body or feel like it isn't mine. However, I've noticed that when I try things that, to me, are associated with feminity such as lipstick, eye makeup, or bras I feel this rush of satisfaction and love how they make me look. Is this gender euphoria? I feel similar things when I try acknowledging myself mentally as non-binary/not just a man. It feels like there's this huge part of my personality I've been repressing by thinking of myself as a just man and I feel so much love and mental freedom. 

The problem is I've identified as kind of a feminine guy for most of my life so I'm questioning as to whether these experiences just reflect that I don't relate to masculine social norms. Are there any amab enby's who relate to this?

Another level of complication is I think my gender identity may have shifted due to me becoming disabled at age 18.

I have virtually no experience in/with the LGBTQ community as, until recently, no one in my inner circles was part of this community. Forgive me in advance for any wrong terminology used; I'm trying to learn!

I obviously love him for whoever he is and I'm extremely proud of his bravery. I moved countries last year so I can't be there in person for him in this life-changing period, which saddens me. I was wondering if any of you have any tips of how I can best support him 'from a distance'? Or any tips in general?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 4th year game design student, and I'm working on a dissertation pertaining to non-binary inclusion in role-playing games. If you're a non-binary gamer who plays RPGs, I'd really appreciate it if you could answer my survey! All respondents will remain anonymous, and all questions are optional.

The survey seeks to gather the thoughts and opinions of non-binary players of RPGs in regards to their experiences in the genre. Data collected will be used to establish the current state of non-binary inclusion in RPGs, and draw attention to what non-binary players would like to see in RPGs going forward.

I'm also hoping to conduct some short online interviews, so if you're interested in participating in that, you can leave a contact email at the end of the survey, or DM me here on Reddit! Any contact information provided will be deleted once the interview process is complete.

&amp;#x200B;

Before taking part, please ensure that you fulfill the following criteria;

* You are at least 18 years of age
* You identify as non-binary
* You are a player of RPGs

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!

I'm AMAB and for as long as I can remember I sometimes felt drawn to women's clothes. It started with my mother's (as it often does) but somewhere down the line I got my own feminine clothes and I often wear them when I'm alone at home.

And since a few days ago, I just thought that I was a cis man who liked to crossdress every once in a while. However, somehow I came across r/egg_irl and I started to relate so much to some of the memes that I started to wonder about what I'd been subconsciously ignoring for so long: that I might be non-binary myself.

I also, since getting more into progressive politics online, started to deconstruct much of the gendered bullshit I've been subjected to all my life and it just feels so restrictive to be forced into this tiny box of what it means to be a man. Every time someone calls for a ""strong man"" to help them move or open something I just cringe and I wonder how people can ignore the blatant sexism in that statement. I hate being reduced to my gender, and I hate that it matters so much to people.

The problem with just identifying as a crossdresser is, as I've just realized yesterday, that I can stay in my feminine persona for several days on end without feeling ""out of place"" and that I actually identify as a woman when I am in ""girl-mode"". My body is very androgenous as well so with a nice haircut and makeup I think I could actually pass as a woman for most people.

However, while I am technically out of the binary, I still feel like I can't really relate to many enbys because my experience is just one gender at a time. Probably that would make me genderfluid, but I feel like telling anyone in my life would just be weird because I still present and identify as a guy all of the time when I'm around them.

I'm glad that I don't experience dysphoria, but I am just so confused about my gender. Am I ""truly"" non-binary? Do I have to come out to anyone? Does it help?

Many people have tried to change my mind, or thought I'd grow out of it. My family all knows I'll never change my mind and they know it's a part of me that I'm dead set on.

I recently realized that, although I now know I'm also asexual (i think aegosexual specifically), I always had a severe....draw back (??) on having someone's bits near mine, where there was even a possibility I could conceive.

At the time, I had no idea I was ace, nonbinary or what dysphoria was. But now that I know, and I've seen others experiences, I now know it was, and is, a form of bottom dysphoria and also dysphoria around my reproductive organs.

This subreddit really opened my eyes to the different things I've experienced over the years that I had no explanation for, because I didnt know what to label it as. 

Although I know many people share their serious issues here, and I always try to be a form of support when I can, I'm equally thankful for the people that share their experiences so others, like myself, arent as confused about themselves.

Here, and on many other subreddits, I've found some amazing people, that just want to be seen, heard and truly noticed. I feel that, truly.

I have no idea who this person was, but someone once told me, to avoid feeling invalidated, I just needed to suck it up and come out to everyone. If it was that easy, I'd have been out a long time ago.

I'm out to one family member, my brother. He's always been supportive. The others....I dont know how they would react. My mom and Grandma both are a bit transphobic. Mostly due to the time they grew up in and not growing with the ways of today. They arent hateful people regardless.

I'm not trans, nor do I want to make any sort of transition in the future (this is just my personal journey), but I do go by they/them pronouns and have chosen a new name. I use this name among friends and even at work. That's what everyone knows me as, regardless of my legal name.

I dont hate my legal name, but I largely prefer my new name being used. My family, of course, uses my legal name and still refers to me as she/her, as they're unaware of anything else. Other than my brother, they probably wouldn't consider me anything different even if I told them, to be honest. 

On any social media that my family is present, I have to use my legal name still and hide the fact that I'm enby. That's only one platform, but it's enough to feel a bit upsetting when you have to go with female pronouns, against your preferences.

Occasionally, I still feel, almost guilty, for changing my identity. My mom loves my name, and I almost didn't survive as a baby, so it's a very special thing for her. It would be heartbreaking for her to know I dont want to go by that name again. Hence the reason, I will probably never be out to her, at least for her to know about my new name.

All this aside, my main point is to say that regardless of if you're out to your friends and family, and can/cant go by what you prefer, you're still valid. You should never feel like you ""dont fit in"" because you arent out.

Being closeted, with anything, doesnt make you any less valid in your identity/sexuality, etc.

TLDR: I started T and started working on my relationship with exercise and eating. I’m worried how other will look at me, even though I like how I look (not fully, but working on it)

Hi everyone! I’m a 30 year old Agender/Transmasc person. I’m also gay. I started T a few months ago. When I was a woman I was really obsessed with my weight and staying in a certain 5 Lb range. I was extremely strict. I’m vegan(for the past 12 years) and also workout a lot between cycling, running, and yoga.

Lately, I've realized that I'm not going to pass as a binary gender, and it got me wondering about gender and life in general.

Earlier this year I finally realized I'm non-binary and pansexual. My parents (my dad more than my mom) are super conservative and are the type that think if you're not cis and straight you're evil.

She was in the hospital for a few days and met someone who identifies as non-binary/trans masc, uses he/him pronouns and has a new name. They got along really well but since my mom has come home she's dead named him about 30 times, keeps calling him ""her"" and saying he's just confused. She also said that ""non binaries don't exist.

2020-12-13 01:03:03,kc11vb,4,1,"Howdy all! 

This is my first post on this subreddit, and first post with this account. Aaaaaand am just now realizing how long this post is, guess I have a lot to get off my chest! 

I recently have begun to re-examine my gender identity and I'm not 100% sure where to start. In highschool I was kind of a gothy, bisexual-ish looking girl, I put little effort into my looks or identity.  In college, I made an effort to make myself appear more androgynous (which is hard because I'm a rather voluptuous AFAB). Androgony (sp?) made me feel comfortable, but I didn't appreciate the difficulty in finding gender neutral clothes.  At the time, I think this presentation may have been more of a political statement about gender roles than anything, but I'm not sure, it's hard for my to remeber. Now, I dress and appear in a more traditionally cis het feminine way (side note, I am bisexual, but haven't had the privlige of exploring my sexuality much either). I feel comfortable in the way I outwardly present currently. 

I enjoy the performance of femininity at times, but other times I feel much more interested in performing in a more androgynous way. I do think that I would enjoy makeup, dresses and other fem appearing things no matter my gender assigned at birth, and don't necessarily feel more like a woman because I engage with these feminine, apperance based behaviors. To me, appearing feminine is completely divorced from how I feel about my gender identity.  

This might sound so weird, but sometimes I swear I'm a bisexual man who loves having titties, and a vagina (I have never really talked about that specific thought before, but it somehow feels comfotring to me).  I have no idea if any of this makes sense or not.  Other people have told me that I come off as a gay man who is happily living in a woman's body, which also might not make any sense, but made me feel happy and seen. The uncertainty feels good somehow. 

I have always been attracted to gender non conforming folks, and would love it if sometimes people couldn't tell my sex or gender just by looking at me, which has not happened to me as an adult because of how curvy my body appears. However, I don't feel uncomfortable in my body, I quite like my curves. 

As a side note, I also don't know if having a label for my gender identity matters that much to me.  I don't really care what people call me, as long as they don't refer to me as masculine. Being called a woman is feeling increasingly more awkward for me though. I wish I could put my finger on what exactly I mean when I say that. Right now typing this post feels strange, acknowledging the things I am saying, and how I have felt for years. It's just something that I haven't put a ton of thought into until now and it almost feels like I'm faking it. 

It makes me feel kind of weird questioning all this while not fitting into the skinny completely androgynous stereotype often applied to no-binary folks.  I guess it's hard not having too many role models who look and feel like myself. I have non-binary friends, but don't want to put them in the hot seat too often by asking tons of questions about self discovery. Doing so somehow seems like I'm taking advantage of them, even though I don't think they would see it that way. 

Do any of you have any ideas about what can I do to play around with my gender identity in private without comitting to anything right away, or coming out?  I feel like I want to keep this to myself and my one close non-binary friend for now.  Where can I go for more self discovery resources? 

Be kind please, this isn't something I have shared before and I feel nervous!

2020-12-13 21:42:22,kcjhcv,4,1,"Well, I know I have body dysmorphia. 25/AFAB

I am having a bit of a crisis. As a kid I was food-insecure. My mom was too ill and depressed to make us food or grocery shop, so we kind of just made do, and my dad just didn’t do anything about it. Because of that I was a skinny kid. Not crazy skinny, but I was always the smallest person in my class by far. I mean part of it was genetics as well, we weren’t starving, but I remember begging kids for food at the lunch table because I didn’t have enough.

So I was always very skinny up until about a year, year and a half ago. I developed pretty bad anorexia. My BMI was about 16, and there were times I weighed less than in 8th grade as an adult. 

I have major issues with my body. I am living at home and moved out of my old apartment due to medical issues that I won’t go too far into. However I’m weight-restored and am 35+ lbs heavier than my lower weights. I’m BMI 22 now.

I mean part of it is, my identity was tied to being thin. Part of it seems more like dysphoria, and the friends who I’ve talked to have broached the subject a little.

As I gained weight, I’m way curvier than I ever could have thought. Very pear shaped, large hips and butt, small waist, smaller but still there boobs. There’s 12” between my waist and hips. And I feel.... so wrong.

I can’t really explain it. I don’t know if it’s dysphoria or dysmorphia or straight up internalized misogyny. I feel very uncomfortable with hips. I want my ass to go away. 

Part of it is.... I’m autistic. Was a very awkward and not particularly pretty kid. I turned 13 and went from a tomboy who was awkward and quiet and known for being smart, to “conventionally beautiful”. It has always made me very uncomfortable and I really can’t put my finger on it. 

I do not like attention. I love wearing a face mask at work and sitting behind a desk so nobody can really see me. I don’t find myself ugly, it’s not that I think people are lying to me or sucking up, but I hate my body and I hate any attention placed on my looks. I hate it. I don’t even UNDERSTAND it. I feel gross being commented on or flirted with. I’ve had partners, I’m bisexual. But like... I hate these stereotypical “beautiful, sexy, pretty” words. I do not want anyone to look at me like that. I love romance but stop telling me how sexy I am everyday. I once snapped at an ex because he wouldn’t stop calling me beautiful. I don’t care, I don’t want to hear it. Ever.

There’s a weird disconnect between my body and mind and now it’s worse that I look more.... womanly. Sometimes I’m painfully aware that I’ve got a big ass and girl legs and boobs.  Something about all that makes me feel weird.

This developed at puberty. I had some “mild” sexual issues with guys at that age—groping me in the halls and whatnot. But I feel like many AFAB people have had this issue, and while I am NOT arguing that it cannot be traumatizing, they don’t feel as I do. It’s just a bizarre disconnect between my mind and body and it’s crazy severe. I don’t want to be a man so I’ve never thought of myself as trans, but I feel different from a woman and I feel like...  I want to be an androgynous nothing. I am currently working at a place where I need to dress nice, so I wear dresses and leggings often (leggings are so comfortable compared to pants with my sensory issues) but I don’t feel COMFORTABLE.

I went through a period when I was very underweight where I did identify as NB and wore more... masculine clothes. I continue to keep my hair short and probably will forever. But I don’t want to just like the androgynous aesthetic, I want to know what the fuck and who the fuck I am.

I just don’t understand this. I want nobody to recognize or care about my gender, but is that an internalized shitty idea of women? Or is it that I’ve gained weight? I mean I’ve always had this issue but it’s been exacerbated.

As a kid I was food-insecure. My mom was too ill and depressed to make us food or grocery shop, so we kind of just made do, and my dad just didn’t do anything about it. Because of that I was a skinny kid. Not crazy skinny, but I was always the smallest person in my class by far. I mean part of it was genetics as well, we weren’t starving, but I remember begging kids for food at the lunch table because I didn’t have enough.\n\nSo I was always very skinny up until about a year, year and a half ago. I developed pretty bad anorexia. My BMI was about 16, and there were times I weighed less than in 8th grade as an adult. \n\nI have major issues with my body. I am living at home and moved out of my old apartment due to medical issues that I won’t go too far into. However I’m weight-restored and am 35+ lbs heavier than my lower weights. I’m BMI 22 now.\n\nI mean part of it is, my identity was tied to being thin. Part of it seems more like dysphoria, and the friends who I’ve talked to have broached the subject a little.\n\nAs I gained weight, I’m way curvier than I ever could have thought. Very pear shaped, large hips and butt, small waist, smaller but still there boobs. There’s 12” between my waist and hips. And I feel.... so wrong.\n\nI can’t really explain it. I don’t know if it’s dysphoria or dysmorphia or straight up internalized misogyny. I feel very uncomfortable with hips. I want my ass to go away. \n\nPart of it is.... I’m autistic. Was a very awkward and not particularly pretty kid. I turned 13 and went from a tomboy who was awkward and quiet and known for being smart, to “conventionally beautiful”. It has always made me very uncomfortable and I really can’t put my finger on it. \n\nI do not like attention. I love wearing a face mask at work and sitting behind a desk so nobody can really see me.

It’s been about a month now that I’ve been nonbinary, slowly dressing more genderfluid, etc. A couple weeks ago, I came out to my 4 best friends.

Most of my family have been accepting of my sexuality (they dont know of my gender identity yet.), so I’m not too worried about them. Mostly my husband.

1) get a good job (for kids and I, as for now I’m financially dependent on him) 
2) get a bank account (that he cant touch)
3) find a safe place in case things go wrong
4) get a new (cheap) phone and transfer everything to it

Interestingly, I do enjoy femininity and hyperfemininity, but I regret that my time with masculinity was shorter/ less in depth. \n\nMy gender euphoria from femme expression has increased as well, even my androgynous/neutral expression. I have a microlabels in mind that makes me happy, so I'm wondering if my somewhat manic euphoria is due to having a genderful identity rather than a genderless one.\n\nI'm just really excited to explore and express fully what I'm feeling!"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Gender confusion!', 'created': 1607947121.0}"

\- I ve been attending acting school for 8 years in the past and also very much enjoy Tabletop-Roleplaying games so i already have pretty good experience with other gender roles and stuff.  
\- In my language (Russian) there are two analogs of they/them pronouns, one is for inanimate objects and other is deeply impersonal so its kinda awkward to use either.   
\- Also in russian language almost every verb can be gendered according to the pronouns so its a lot of work to actually get used to using them all the time and its really noticeable if you or others don't   


So the pont its, Ive been curious about nonbinary/gender-nonconforming/genderfluid for a long time  
I tried using gender neutral pronouns for about 4 months and either due to me not liking it much or due to nature of the language its still sounds realy off, (although when people call me person instead of men it still feels good) But im comfortable with using both He/Him and She/Her especially in online spaces. IRL i prefer a mix of both feminine and manly features but not really trying to look neutral. Due to my acting background i often change my personas in online spaces, sometimes including pronouns.  


Do i fit to the description of nonbinary or maybe i should try other stuff like gender fluid and all? Cause my mind tells me that im just an acting freak and altogether im still a man and just trying justify my acting experiments with fancy words.

2020-12-15 02:15:20,kdcic4,15,1,"Hi lovely people, 

I have been dating a non-binary person for over a year now. We’re very happy and I love them so so much, but, as someone that previously identified as a lesbian, I’ve been struggling with my identity, or more so with how other people perceive it. 

I would like to clarify that I am not embarrassed by my partner. On the contrary, I cannot even begin to explain how much I admire them and adore showing them off. The problems I disclose here are all to do solely with me; I am the problem, not them. 

When we first started seeing each other, I was not looking for a serious relationship, so I didn’t really start to have issues with myself until a month or so into our relationship, when I realised that feeling were developing quickly. 

I guess my biggest problem comes from the term lesbian itself. I’m sure many other gay women will be able to relate to what I’m about to say, but I have had a bad relationship with the term lesbian for a long time. Despite identifying with it’s meaning, I felt (and still feel) a lot of shame when being related to the term. Before I met my partner, I was working on this, learning to accept this part of myself and try to get rid of the shame, working through my internalised homophobia. Of course, now I would never identify as a lesbian as I am not dating a woman, and I don’t really feel an urge to identify as one, but it does feel like I abandoned a big process in my life. I do not regret it for the slightest, my partner is the best thing that has ever happened to me, but I have struggled with my identity throughout my whole life and now I’m not quite sure how I can work through it considering the situation I’m in. I guess I’m looking for some advice in that regard, or possibly even just hearing about people who have had similar experiences, as I do feel strangely alone.

2020-12-15 04:55:59,kdf5r7,5,1,"(Trigger warning:Transphobia)

This post is a lot longer than I planned it to be lol

So basically I’m a part of semi small discord server where we talk about bootleg video games and anything else we feel like talking about. I posted a drawing and someone asked a question about it (I forget the question) and I said, “I just felt like drawing a cute femthem.” The person said “what” so I said someone who I non-binary but also feminine, I then said that I’m a “fem-them” and this person said, “so you’re a girl.” Oh boy did my dysphoria love that! As shit started to hit the fan other people started to watch, some sent links to not credible sources saying that there are only 2 genders and others said to shut the fuck up and that he should respect my pronouns. You might be thinking, “what were the moderators doing?” 

Well, the were freaking the fuck out, they have never had something like this happen and didn’t know what to do. Another important thing to note is that the transphobe is a moderator. I left the server temporarily because I was having a panic attack and a friend helped me calm down, he said that the mod left and I rejoined, some crazy shit happened when I left.

 I didn’t say anything after rejoining and the owner spoke to me, they basically had no idea what happened but they were sympathetic towards me and said that the person shouldn’t have kept calling me a girl when it was feeding my dysphoria. They also mentioned the guy who messaged me helping me calm down, they basically said that he’s really nice and was defending me and wanted to help. Afterwards the mod also said that they are just watching in the background because they don’t know what to do.

 Ok so after joining the transphobic mod rejoins, and he starts spewing bs again. Another mod stepped in and tried to sort this out, the transphobic mod said that I was forcing my opinion that I’m not a girl onto him, I basically tried to explain gender dysphoria and how it affects me but transphobe didn’t care.

 After more bs another mod messaged me, basically saying that this situation sucks but there’s nothing to do really, I could tell that they were trying to be nice but it came across as rude. There was a lot of back and forth, the mod thought that there was some sort of misunderstanding when there wasn’t, and they were kinda defending his actions while also understanding my side, but it was clear that they didn’t fully understand what he was saying, I thought they were nice but also tried to be unbiased when they’ve been friends with the transphobe for a while. 

After this I said fuck it, I’m talking to the transphobe. We had a short conversation, we both wanted to stay civil. He apologized for offending me and that he didn’t mean to do anything malicious, he still refuses to use they/them pronouns and said that he’ll just not use any pronouns and not mention gender. I explained dysphoria a bit more to explain why I acted the way I did and he said that he already apologized. I said that if he can, I’d appreciate it if he could acknowledge my gender and he said, “I’m not going to acknowledge your exist. Once again sorry if I offended you but that’s as far as I’m going with this subject.” I think that’s a dick thing to do but it’s whatever as long as he stops calling me a girl. He’s now acting like we’re best friends and now everything’s pogchamps between us. 

*Anyway, how is this a civil war?*

 Well, the start of this was all on the public server, everyone saw it and everyone formed their opinions over gender and who was in the wrong. There was a lot of fighting. Transphobe is telling everyone that, “we worked it out, we’re all good.” Which I said was not true but he agreed to stop calling me a girl. I’ve had a couple people on the server message me saying how awful the transphobes are, some people blamed the mod staff, others blame the transphobic mod, others blame me. It’s not a huge war but there are still arguments happening.

I’m hoping that this will have a happy ending, all the mods seem have a discussion every Sunday and the owner already invited me to talk with them for a bit, I have some ideas about having rules against hate/discrimination and having a way to assign pronoun roles.

He apologized for offending me and that he didn’t mean to do anything malicious, he still refuses to use they/them pronouns and said that he’ll just not use any pronouns and not mention gender. I explained dysphoria a bit more to explain why I acted the way I did and he said that he already apologized. I said that if he can, I’d appreciate it if he could acknowledge my gender and he said, “I’m not going to acknowledge your exist. Once again sorry if I offended you but that’s as far as I’m going with this subject.” I think that’s a dick thing to do but it’s whatever as long as he stops calling me a girl. He’s now acting like we’re best friends and now everything’s pogchamps between us. \n\n*Anyway, how is this a civil war?*\n\n Well, the start of this was all on the public server, everyone saw it and everyone formed their opinions over gender and who was in the wrong. There was a lot of fighting. Transphobe is telling everyone that, “we worked it out, we’re all good.” Which I said was not true but he agreed to stop calling me a girl. I’ve had a couple people on the server message me saying how awful the transphobes are, some people blamed the mod staff, others blame the transphobic mod, others blame me. It’s not a huge war but there are still arguments happening.\n\nI’m hoping that this will have a happy ending, all the mods seem have a discussion every Sunday and the owner already invited me to talk with them for a bit, I have some ideas about having rules against hate/discrimination and having a way to assign pronoun roles.

I've socially transitioned, my work refers to me by my pronouns, I've started living as my authentic self. Hell my partner has taken it upon himself to become more educated so he can support me while I'm pregnant. He asked me out of the blue if I would be comfortable chestfeeding and what our backup plan is if it makes me dysphoric. He's helping me plan getting chest surgery since I can't bind due to thick chest tissue.

I feel fully supported by my friends, family, and work, but I've gotten so much shit for being nonbinary from binary, trans people. I don't subscribe to the binary gender, I'm not a balance of both, I'm not genderless. I have a gender, but it's not definable with masc or fem or male or female, I'm maverique. I don't speak over binary trans people and it's not like I announce my gender identity unless the situation, conversation, or relationship calls for it. I lead with ""As a nonbinary, trans person"" when I need to comment on it.

Apparently I haven't gone through the same pain as the binary, I haven't had to fight for visibility, I don't really understand what its like to be born into the wrong body because I can decide that my body works for my gender identity. 

Because of who I am, I've been medically discriminated against, I've had people refuse to work with me, I've been recommended therapy for my ""mental illness."" People don't inherently understand something that isn't binary. People have to think of me as multiple people to just get my fucking pronouns right.

I'm not safe in straight places and I'm not safe in trans spaces. It feels like when I identified as bisexual (because I didn't realize I was actually nonbinzry) and everyone said I wasn't gay enough when I dated women because I had also dated men, and I was actually straight when I married a man.

Would a binary trans person who doesn't want to physically transition be invalidated? Would a binary trans person who doesn't or can't take hormones be invalidated? Serious questions and I have the feeling that both answers are yes.

Quick rundown of backstory: I am AFAB, always felt a bit confused about my gender for as long as I can remember. Felt more like a boy until I was about 12, kinda embraced being more feminine in my teens, kept hitting this identity crisis wall every so often.



Decided I was probably nonbinary around 18 years old. Wasn't met with support from my partner at the time and lacked the confidence to follow it through. So I pushed it away.



Few more years passed. Met new partner who is amazing. Finally figured my shit out and came out again at the age of 25 a few months ago. Felt super good to embrace it. Yay.



I mean...kind of yay. I have told a few very close people in my life, taking things super slowly. People have mostly been fine, generally pretty positive response. Originally went with 'she/they' but realised I like 'they' more. 



My partner, don't get me wrong, is super supportive but he has not been respecting the fact I want to be referred to as 'they' and I'm getting tired of pushing for it. He is nice when I remind him but he won't call me but my preferred pronouns (to other people I'm out to) without me reminding him. He doesn't correct himself without me reminding him.

I have a few other close people who still call me she, her, girl and honestly sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I just accepted it. I hate being a defeatist and I'm kinda mad at how weak I'm being. But I almost feel like I'm being a pain by reminding people of preferred pronouns and to keep going on about it. The fire just isn't in me right now. 



I know people try not to overreact or say too much when people come out, but I'd prefer people ask me questions about how I feel and what would make me feel supported going forward.

Tw: panic/anxiety attack

I came out as non-binary to my mum, friends and classmates around a year ago, but I’ve known something was off with my gender and I didn’t feel right for a long time, I just tried to ignore it because back then I didn’t experience as much disphoria for me to realise/notice.
It took a lot of effort but my mum has allowed me to change my name at school by the end of last school year and so it’s now officially on the register and teachers received an individual email to inform them about the change, but my biology teacher always dead names me in front of the entire class, whether it’s giving out books, doing register or telling us our grades and scores even though it’s already been so long people mostly forgot I used to go by a different name before, I don’t know but it seems like it’s on purpose. Not to mention, in biology class I sit next to this guy and he either doesn’t have the brain capacity to remember my name or he doesn’t want to use it because he can’t be bothered. I love biology as a subject but I started to stress out a lot about having to go to that class. I always space out without noticing and I start shaking every time I hear him talking even if it’s with someone else. I want to talk to someone and tell them but it feels a bit awkward since they’ve not experienced anything similar. Is this normal? 
Yesterday I had biology last lesson and I heard my dead name for 5 times in the lesson by the teacher and the person sitting next to me and I felt like something in my brain just snapped. I cold sense it coming by the beginning of the lesson. I can’t describe it but based on what the internet and the only friend I told this I had a panic attack. I think. I’ve never experienced anything like that before and I was terrified. I was freezing but sweating like when I have a fever and my mind was blank for a while and the next second it would flood with all kind of uncomfortable thoughts, all my muscles were so tense I nearly threw up. I felt like my entire brain was like on fire and I couldn’t stop shaking. I genuinely thought I was going to die. I don’t know if it was caused by being dead named. is that even possible? Why did it happen in school and not at home where my parents ignore the fact I’m trans even though I’ve tried to talk to them?

There so much I don’t understand but I know for a fact that I’m non-binary. I want to tell my parents how I feel and I want them to use my name and pronouns, I promised to myself last Christmas that this year it will be alright and that I can do it, but the more transphobic arguments I hear the more pointless this all is. Having my friends and classmates refer to me the way I prefer made me so happy and comfortable to just be me and I wish my parents would be able to at least try and see for themselves what difference it makes in my mental health and the way I participate in this family. I don’t know how long I can hold it without bursting out and saying/doing something I’ll regret. Its getting worse day by day, yesterday made me see this and I’m really scared it will happen again. So I just wanted to share my thoughts is all. Any kind of opinion/suggestion is really appreciated.

^((This does not apply for other bigender/multiple gender people whose gender identify is a combination of non-AGAB genders, or when the term trans would be the most appropriate term technically and practically.\))  
  
Can a genderfluid person identifies as any gender modality term, or just trans, depending on their (current) gender identify, and whether their current gender identify does match with their AGAB or not?  
  
&amp;#x200B;
  
For instance, an AGAB demigender person ^([see note]) who partly identifies as a __cisgender__^(\#2) person but does not describe/consider themself as being trans, even through a part of their gender identify does not match their AGAB, are their gender modality valid?  
  
This is just one of my numerous hypothetical situations.

## Notes:  
^([see note]) – My AGAB is male, so in my case, demiboy would be the ""AGAB demigender"" identify.
 * On the flip side if I was a demigirl, I would be 100% trans, since no part of my gender identify would be connected to my AGAB in any way.  
  
\#2 – I don't even know if anyone here have even heard of the term [__demicisgender__](https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Demicisgender) linked in the LGBTA Wikia before, which is not always reliable/accurate IMO.

Recently dysphoria has developed around it and it started to get quite bad, so I decided that I’d grow it out for a while. After a couple of months it had gone from short to medium length, but also began to get really uneven so naturally everyone (me included) wanted me to get a haircut to fix it.

I’ve been working through the process of getting top surgery 


I’ve known i wanted it since before i even knew it was a thing


However, i recently learned about enbies who get top surgery and don’t get the nipple grafts / nipples put back on

I’m really thinking about it cause that’s definitely a big part of what i don’t like about my chest but idk if getting them completely removed is something i want??? Tho I’m a sex repulsed ace so I’m not interested in keeping them for any sort of “pleasure” related reasons


Like i can’t really think of a reason to get the grafts other than it’s like more “socially acceptable” than to go without

2020-12-19 11:01:50,kg5w84,2,2,"Story time! 

So. I didn't need to come out to my class because... Uh... Let's say, people are crazier than ever expected here. Got stalked on a writing site where I feel safe and they dig up information like my gender. I was scared when I learned that because I had much problem with my class some years before, like bullying, mocking, and my anger issues that was growing cause of them, adding up my anxiety, I was feeling almost sick when a girl of my class come and say ""hm... They know you are... Uh, how did you write it..? Non-something. Just for your information""

She wasn't informed at all but she did help me calm down before talking to them so I'm thankful for her. She even listen to me about what it is, so it's okay, I don't blame her. 

Then, in a sport class, when my team wasn't playing, theirs wasn't either, and they come with the famous and f*cking stressing ""we need to talk."" I wasn't breathing normally but I did my best to hide it because being used to anxiety seizures, I didn't wanted to let myself worsen my case. 

But they didn't insult me. Didn't bully. Didn't scream. They was just staring at me like ""what is that thing?"" And ""how did you discover it?"" Or even ""so you're not a... Girl?""

I explained to them. Everything I can say, I said it, because even if I didn't liked them really much, I was saying that they wasn't so mean for a time so they was maybe sincere. 

Of course, they didn't understand at first. ""Your pronoun is... "" iel ""(French neutral pronoun who's even least respected than the singular they)??"". 
Yeaaah- they're not gonna remember it. 
""You do look emo and not girly but I never thought you-""
 No, girl, I'm not out dummy. 
""But how does it work?""
Uuh- that's just how I'm feeling, I dunno, that's just like that-

They didn't ask me if I wanted to change my name(I do) or even change the pronouns used with me so I thought maybe they forgot about it or just didn't care after all but at least they didn't react bad so it was okay for me. 

But after some days, my soul sister, who's a year above me, tell me that her class was talking about me. What!? (I'm out to her) 
She say that she heard some of them say thing like:
""Eh, did you know there are a trans at our school?""
""No! Really?? I never knew it!""
""Who is it?""
""[Deadname], I think. You know, the girl with the girlfriend in another country""
""Wow, she's really brave""
""Yeah I agree! I wish her luck.""

Sooo, I'm actually a enby that consider myself as trans cause I want to do a lot of change to look the more androgynous possible. But I do know they have surely the wrong ideas, surely think I want to be a boy or something. And like, they are kind, encouraging even for some, but each time I think/hear/see theses d*mn female pronouns, I can't help but shiver, wince, and suffeeer. Dysphoria y'know. 

So here I am. 

Does someone has tips, advices or something to explain to them ? Because their attitude are cool but still hurtful the way they talk and my shy not-out-everywhere introvert self doesn't know how to handle all that and I thought I could prepare myself for that during winter break.

So, I was assigned male at birth.

Basic statements:

I like they/them and I find it super cool when people use them to refer to me, but I wouldn't even notice if someone used he/him and generally in my day-to-day life I use male pronouns for the sake of ease. Words that imply masculinity like ""dude"" don't bother me.

I do not feel uncomfortable with my anatomy in any way, but I feel disconnected from the stereotypes of the ideal dude and I don't desire to be like him. I'm currently growing my hair out but some days I really just want to chop it all off again. I'm self-conscious about my appearance, but I'm also a teenager.

Sometimes I would like to wear make-up and dresses and feminine attire, but I also like wearing ""masculine"" clothing. What can I say, 3-piece suits are dope.

I have more friends who are women than I do men, by a ratio of about 3:4. Not sure if that's very important, but I just find them easier to relate to in some ways than guys.

I've been hanging around the LGBTQ+ community for quite a bit without really talking about anything or getting mega-involved and you guys seem nice so I just thought I'd post here and get some secondary opinions since I'm really worried I'm faking it for attention and that I'll come out as something I'll eventually realize I'm not and have to walk back on in the future.

I’m an AFAB individual and still grappling with this strange concept that is my gender, but there are a few things I am sure of.

But after Christmas, I need to come out to him, as this isn’t an area of my life I can handle keeping things a secret. Every time he calls me a girl or his girlfriend, it feels just awfully wrong, because I know for a fact I’m not a girl.

2020-12-20 10:21:48,kgrtvj,4,1,"This story starts somewhen in the first half of 2002. My parents find out that my mom is pregnant again and they go to the OB-GYN and get told they are going to have a healthy kid. Two hands with 10 fingers and two feet with 10 toes, more importantly a heart, two halves of one brain and a sex. They don’t want to know if I’m going to be a girl or a boy because they don’t care -why would they-. They already have most of the clothes and stuff, because there are already two older sisters living with them and the new baby can wear the stuff they outgrew. It’s okay because most of the clothes are white or neutral colors like green, green doesn’t have a gender. It’s the end of January 2003 and a girl is born. It’s me and I’m a bit small and don’t weigh a lot but everything is perfect. I can grow and flourish.

It’s the beginning of 2006 and I decide it’s time I start dressing myself. I like dresses and T-Shirts and pinks and greens and blues and neons but most of all I like rainbow. It’s my favorite color. It’s September of 2006 and I’m starting preschool and realize that pinks is a „girl color“. Blue is my favorite color as well as rainbow but not pink. I don’t like pink. I also don’t like the games most of the girls play like house. It’s 2008 and there’s a new educator and I stare at her. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and I can’t look away. She asks me what’s wrong and I spend most days playing board games with her. I don’t really have friends but the boys who are one year older than me. It’s 2010 and I start primary school. I have had no friends for one year but it was okay because I could study the garden and talk to the educators. We are 6 girls and 18 boys. All the girls are friends and the cool girls get to play with the boys. I’m not cool so I sit with the girls and watch them while they play horse. I don’t really feel like I fit in with them but that’s okay because I never really feel like I fit in. It’s 2012 and suddenly my boobs grew so much my sisters tell my I have to wear a bra or else I am disgusting. I don’t feel strange when I wear it so I don’t. But I can’t do anything to stop these things to grow so I give in and hate them for 2 years but I can’t do anything.

It’s 2014 and I’m on vocation with my mom, one of my sisters and my brother. I get my period for the first time. I know what is happening because my older cousin told me when I was 8. My mom hasn’t, because it makes her uncomfortable and I will be taught in school but that never really happens. I am ashamed and don’t tell anyone. I don’t use any menstrual products but it’s okay because the flow isn’t that heavy. I just feel really weird and ashamed and wrong. It’s the end of 2014 and I get my period for the third time. The flow gets heavier and I steal pads from my mom but she doesn’t notice so it’s okay.

It’s the summer of 2015 and my family is hosting a barbecue. I’m allowed to start a bonfire and get all the panties I bled into and bunch them up and try to burn them so nobody notices but my mom sees them and confronts me about it. So I cry and tell her about it. She is happy for me and tries to congratulate me but I’m ashamed and embarrassed so I run to my room and cry for the rest of the day. Later that summer I’m on vocation with my mom and my 2 sisters. We rent a holiday flat. I get my period again which is normal because they started to come every month since the new year. I forget to bring extra pads for myself and have to use toilet paper. I sleep and the next day there’s a lot of blood on the couch. My mom asks me why I didn’t tell her and I stop talking to her for one day.

It’s 2016 and I start using tampons because my oldest sister said that I might be more comfortable if I don’t have to see my period. And she’s right. It’s a bit better. It’s the fall of 2016 and my friends tell each other how some of them have gotten their period over the summer and I think I could say something about how I have had mine for 2 years but I don’t because they think I haven’t had mine yet. It’s 2020 and I stand in front of my mirror almost every evening trying to squish my boobs so they look flat but it doesn’t work. I buy a binder but they are to big and my hips are too wide and sometimes I like it but most of the time I don’t. Sometimes I like wearing pink dresses but I don't think that's important because color and clothes don't have a gender.

2020-12-21 00:33:33,kh63mk,5,1,"38 year old enby newbie AMAB here (like, two weeks ago new) but I think I finally found a part of me that will help me suss out the puzzle of who my authentic self is. I wanted to kind of rant and ramble about social dysphoria in male spaces, because it's not something I've seen addressed at length and learning about it was a real eye opener for explaining a lot of feelings I've had over the years. 

Like a lot of us I never felt I fit in my assigned gender's space.  I've always felt much more comfortable around women, and I find myself gravitating and talking to my friends' wives instead of my friends at social occasions (remember those?). I always kind of wanted to have that ""gay boyfriend"" role, and I'm considered as ""one of the girls"" at work, a badge I wear with honor. But I have a general unease when I'm hanging out with men. I don't know what to talk about, I don't know how to behave, and I come across as nervous and quiet, shy, soft spoken, and a little...off. Sometimes I detect a hint of pity when I tell someone I don't care for sports, or I know nothing of the workings of cars, or I just can't stand going to the strip club. My lack of participation in the ever-present misogyny that runs through men's conversation goes noticed, too. Sometimes I get singled out almost automatically as ""less than"" or unmanly.  Doesn't matter if it was my more redneck friends from middle school, my liberal and intellectual friends I found in high school, or people or groups I just met. Even some women pick up on it and run with it. It took me a couple decades to realize that this was bullying, and though it was never openly homophobic and I've lived as a straight male for almost four decades, I think that's where the animus came from. My dandyishness and occasionally effete behavior attracted a bit of that attention, I'm sure. Enough of this bullying behavior and I developed a caustic and self deprecating sense of humor. It's not as fun to pick on someone if they're doing it a fine job of it themselves, is it? While it did protect me, I think it also pushed my social status among the guys even lower, and I'm just starting to understand the psychological toll that my sense of humor has wrought on me. 

But, to lighten the mood, here's an anecdote that really made me go ""Oh! I get it!"" once I understood what was at work with my dysphoria: Once, over a wedding weekend, I was sent off (based on gender) to go golfing while the women threw a bridal brunch. The golfing chat consisted mainly of talking about other sports, leaving me out in the dark to nod and try and make the occasional joke so people knew I was still there. When we got back to the brunch I noticed the brides' gay male friend was there, having a blast with the ladies, drinking prosecco and indulging in the taco bar. I was so jealous. That was where I belonged, that's where I would've been comfortable. I've been kicking myself for years over that decision to go golfing, not fully understanding why it bothered me so much, and now I know why, and where that discomfort comes from. 

Learning about social dysphoria made it click for me. I was questioning my gender identity, and I knew about body dysphoria but I don't feel that I have that (other than the obligatory American obsession with weight).  I had that same idea that so many posters here have, that I might not belong because I lacked that particular flavor of dysphoria. But social dysphoria, that unease, that zoning out that happens when I'm listening to men banter and just want to be anywhere else, that's present, and strong. And it makes me feel bad, but I think I can diminish those feelings by being truer to myself. 

I don't know if this realization will help me when I'm hanging out with the guys, but I do know it will make me more comfortable in gravitating towards spaces I feel more comfortable, if they'll have me, and it will give me the confidence I need to say ""No"" when I get asked to do something that doesn't click with who I am.

I was unfortunate enough to be born in an area of south east england heavy in both homophobia and transphobia.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t keep bottling myself up like I have done for years, I need to get out of this cycle somehow but I just don’t understand how.

I want people to know who and what I am, I want people to understand me better, I want freedom to express myself how **I** desire, not how my parents or friends desire. I’ve considered running away on multiple occasions but that would just make things worse.

2020-12-26 13:48:10,kkiuau,8,1,"Hey everyone. So lately, I am confusion *laughs in identity crisis*

I recently realized I'm asexual which was a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. But recently I've been dealing with really bad body dysmorphia and I think I don't like my chest, which is quite large unfortunately. Not to mention I'm plus sized so anything that contributes to curviness is just seen as fat to me. So I bought a binder, which I think is a tad small, but I liked how I looked so much better!

Since then, I've been trying to figure out how I want to look but it's caused me to realize how much I hate how I think others see me. I don't like the idea of them seeing my boobs or clothing or makeup and going ""hey that's a female"" and treating me according to that. The idea of someone not being able to judge me because they honestly don't know what I am makes me feel so powerful! I don't want to be seen as either gender! And I think that would do tons for my body dysmorphia and overall confidence.

But at the same time, the reason I question if I belong, is because I'm not sure how deep that goes. I think I don't like looking blatantly feminine because of how people will judge me as a female but when it comes to myself in the comfort of my own environment, I don't know if I care if I'm female or not? Like I said, I really hate my boobs lol but that's because they throw off my body proportions and ugh. So like with coworkers, I would prefer to be they/them and go by my middle name but with family, I wouldn't mind being she/her and going by my given name.

2020-12-26 20:26:32,kkp9e3,0,1,"During my time in quarantine, I have been questioning my gender identity a lot and it has been a major challenge figuring out where I stand on the gender spectrum. Part of me thinks I could be non-binary, but another part of me is adamant that I’m cis and it’s extremely frustrating.

Here are the reasons why I don’t think I’m cis...
- I recall being irrationally upset over not having male genitalia for as long as I remember. However sometimes, I like the idea of having ambiguous genitalia in recent years. 
- I always hated being female to some extent.
- Even though I have always felt more inclined to live up to male gender roles than female gender roles, I know I’m not a trans man.
- I’m in my mid 20’s, but I’m worried that as I age, I’m worried that my body will start to look more like a “woman’s body”.
- I’ve been questioning off and on through out my life to some extent.
- I used to think that kids favored toys and clothing that was in alignment with their birth sex because they HAD to, not because they wanted to.
- The idea of claiming that I’m non-binary feels right at least some of the time.
- I hate any kind of gender label for myself.
- My once positive experiences with being a trumpet player are upsetting to look back at because they bring back all the memories of being labeled as “the girl who plays the trumpet” even by those who were well intentioned. To make matters worse, I didn’t have the courage to dress on alignment with my gender expression in performance settings before the pandemic.

Here are the reasons why I may not be non-binary.
- Dressing in a way that reflects my gender expression has helped me to feel more comfortable in my skin to some extent.
- I’m not overly upset with being perceived as a woman as long as people limit the use of gendered language when talking to me and I’m not treated like a woman, whatever it means.
- If I had a choice, I would prefer to be a cis woman who’s simply gender-nonconforming.
- When I was little, I liked the idea of being able to have babies, but I hated it once I realized it would change my body.
- The consistency of my gender dysphoria varies to some extent.
- I’m not fully on board with the idea of changing my name.
- Sometimes the idea of being non-binary freaks me out and feels as wrong.
- What if I’m just opposed to gender roles?
- What is it’s normal to feel irrationally depressed over mensural periods?

Here‘s why it’s hard for me to figure this out...
- I have OCD and trans-themed OCD is a real thing.
- Even though I’m not 100% on board with the idea of going by her/she, if I ask others to use they/them pronouns, I instantly regret it and insist on being referred to as her/she again.
- I have a new name picked out, but whenever I consider using it, I change my mind not long after.
- My past attempts of coming out as non-binary left me crying and being adamant that I’m cis shortly after.
- The fact that my parents say they’ll love me no matter how I identify doesn’t alleviate the fears I have.
- Just when I think I have everything all figured out, I become uncertain again.",NonBinaryTalk,Is It OCD or Am I Non-Binary?,1609039592.0,"{'created_utc': 1609014392, 'id': 'kkp9e3', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'During my time in quarantine, I have been questioning my gender identity a lot and it has been a major challenge figuring out where I stand on the gender spectrum.

2020-12-28 06:50:57,kllc08,2,1,"Hi, im nico, im 25 from Argentina, and as of now I've lived as a cis gay man. and well, i was on tik tok tonight, and for laughs i did on of those ""finger down"" challanges that said i was non binary, obvs i knew it was just a game but that got me thinking about watt being nonbinary is. And i did a little reasearch, but im still not sure if that helped me, maybe i am just a cis boy, but that moment when the audio from that tik tok said ""you may be nonbinary"" really shook me for some reason?
The few things I know is that I never liked being addressed as a she, well only while I'm in drag, but I was never addressed with any neutral pronouns so Idk how it would feel, and at the same time, when I biy clothes or go to any sort of shop, I always disliked being confined (I guess is the word? ) to the men sections, I never had a problem with going to the men bathrooms but for the love of god I can't use an urinal. And as for how I like to dress, I use anything I like i guess, I mean I dont use much skirts but that's cause I like the ones that are long and not really tight and I only got one of those.
I also read that non binary people tend start using a kind of unisex (again, is this the word?) nickname, and like a tear ago a friend started to call me Nico (Nicolas isn't 2nd name)and I loved it and started insisting in everyone calling me that, and while in my country Nico is pretty much masculine, I grew up reading fanfics and using tumblr all in english so for me Nico was always pretty much genderless so maybe that was something that I allowed to happen without realizing what it may mean?

Also, this is an area of Queerness that I’m not well versed in, so I apologize if I come off as ignorant. I don’t intend at all to be offensive, and I apologize if anything in this post is triggering, disrespectful, or hurtful. 

TLDR: I came out to my dad as Non-Binary today. I think I’m Non-Binary because I feel like I don’t want to transition, I just want to be less masculine. However, anything related to adjusting my body through hormones scares the hell out of me. Also, I often have this feeling that I should have been a woman, although I don’t currently feel like anatomy-wise I should have been a woman, if that makes sense. Just wondering if anyone has any experiences or advice they would like to share...

*If you want to read this post just be advised, “Honey you’ve got a big storm coming...”

I realized I was gay very early. I didn’t come to terms with it well at first, but I’m at peace with it now and I’m actually proud to be gay. I came out when I was 16 and never looked back. 

What has proven to be an even more difficult journey, is discovering my gender identity. I’ve been struggling with my gender identity for really as long as a I can remember. I’m honestly convinced if I grew up in more recent times, my parents would have gotten me gender reassignment surgery or at the very least hormone blockers or hormone treatments and I would have genuinely wanted it. 

To be fair, my mom straight up told me when I came out, “I can accept that you’re gay, but I couldn’t handle it if you wanted to be a woman.” She’s also made so many transphobic comments, that I don’t even know what to do with my feelings or who I can even talk to. So maybe my theory doesn’t hold water...

Nevertheless, in my case, when I hit puberty those feelings of needing or wishing to be a woman gradually faded. 

I’ve found that those feelings of gender dysphoria have been replaced by body dysmorphia. Instead of feeling like I should have a female anatomy, it’s more so a problem of not liking the intensity of my male anatomy. I’m 6’4, really hairy, and bald, which to me is the furthest thing from feminine. That’s just my perception though. 

I didn’t mind not being a girl when I was younger because I was still very short, had cute hair, and I did not have much body hair. However, now I just feel completely unattractive and not myself. I hate my large feet, body hair, and height. It upsets me so deeply, but I don’t know where to place the source of those feelings.

There is one aspect of being a man that I don’t feel like I need, should, or want to change, if you catch my drift 😅 which leads me to believe I might be gender fluid or Non-Binary. 

I spoke with a Non-Binary person who said that they want to go on hormones in order to lessen their masculinity, but not necessarily transition. That really resonated with me, and was a way of looking at things that I never actually considered. That sounds interesting, but I’m honestly so scared to do anything with hormones. I think it’s cause it’s just so new to me. 

I told my dad about all this on a road trip we took today. He seemed pretty accepting. He doesn’t really understand this stuff, but he’s trying and he’s attempting to be as supportive as he can. My mom doesn’t know, nor do I think I will bother telling her. Coming out to him  as Non-Binary wasn’t actually all that bad. He had taken things well when I told him I was gay, so I wasn’t too stressed about this go around. 

However, even though he’s taken it well, I still feel totally unconfident with my gender identity. I guess the issue is, how do I embody confidently an identity I’m not confident with?😂

Also, and this a perception I’m not proud of, I suffer from so much internalized transphobia it’s not even funny. I feel like anytime I try to experiment with my gender, ex. put on feminine outfits or makeup, I just feel like such a Sasquatch 😅 

I’m terrified of what men will think of me. I’m still a virgin and I’ve never even been in a relationship with a man. I just feel like all they’re going to see is a “freak” and not want to be with me. I’m already so lonely, so messing with my gender identity just seems like opening Pandora’s box at this point.

However, that brings me back to that question I asked in the title, “How do I love myself when I feel like I should be someone else?”

I’ve been seriously considering therapy because these questions and struggles have made me feel so stalled in my life. Although I know I have to keep moving, I feel like I can’t progress until I just figure all this out. 

I know accepting these kinds of identities is like running a marathon, not sprint, but hell if I ain’t exhausted. This is so much harder than accepting my sexuality, and that was definitely no lap around the track. I just feel like I don’t have the endurance to tackle something like this and I don’t have the support network either. I’ve told some friends about all this and they have been fairly accepting or at least have tried their best. I honestly don’t know what to ask of them.

I love drag and I’ve considered doing it, but I’m not sure if drag is just something I need to use as a vent for my gender fluidity or if I wish to embody it fully. If that makes sense... I love androgyny and personally I think it’s like the most beautiful thing there is. I feel like I’d be a total Sasha Velour from drag race. 😂

Thank you so much for reading this lengthy post! I guess I’m honestly just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or any advice they would like to share?

*Also, to throw one hell of a monkey wrench in the mix, I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t a part of me that genuinely wishes I could have been with a man as a woman, gotten pregnant, and raised his children. It almost feels like that was my purpose and it was stolen from me. I have no idea where that thought comes from, but it has eaten away at me for as long as I can remember. I almost feel like I’m sick for thinking that way, and it hurts me so much because the thought comes to me so naturally, although it feels Incredibly unnatural.

2020-12-29 12:43:41,kmdqjm,1,1,"So, while I am bi and can be attracted to any gender, I do have a very strong preference for men/masc-aligned people, and said attraction feels very much gay, while at the same time i'm not masc-aligned at all and am heavily considering going on estrogen.

And I just feel like, I see incredibly little non-masc aligned gays/content for us/history about us when just like casually scrolling and observing non-binary people/non-binary pages on pretty much all platforms? And it just strikes me as a bit odd with seeing decently often non-binary lesbians make excellent content about their experiences, their history, including a good deal of them who aren't fem-aligned at all and may even be masc-aligned, and I feel like I observe a decent amount of them in online queer and non-binary specific spaces. And while for a few reasons i'll get into I get why I see less Non-Binary gays, it both feels odd and very frustrating that I feel like I see *so much* less non-binary gays/content directed at us/about us when just observing in the wild. Especially odd with some of the most famous non-binary people in the western world at least being enby gays. (also to clarify as I don't wanna come off like i'm saying anyone has it better, increased visibility comes with tons of issues, Non-Binary lesbians experience tons of discourse, harassment over who they are, and people constantly trying to invalidate them and their identities and experiences that Non-Binary gays don't go through. Just rambling about things from my own personal POV)

As I said for a few reasons I get why I see *less* Non-Binary gays in comparison

1. This is an AMAB specific thing, but I feel like the societal perception of AMAB people's expressions only exist on two extremes, I feel the moment an AMAB person is not considered as masculine they're seem as full-on all the way feminine. So I feel like AMAB trans people even when not binary trans are very likely to hard commit to shedding any association with anything masc. Which partially may explain why when I do observe non-binary gays I feel like I see significantly more Transmasc enby gays than AMAB enby gays in any form. At a higher disparity than I feel like I see AGAB splits with enby lesbians at least. (do note this is just observation and just observations can be complete bullshit and wrong, do tell me if I am!)

2. In general I think a notably higher proportion of cis gay men are going to be hostile to the concept and more defensive of preserving masculinity within the community than cis lesbians are on their end, and with cis people being the main base of both those communities Non-Binary Gays may generally feel more alienated and distant from the overall culture than Non-Binary Lesbians do.

3. Also very possibly a factor with cis gays being usually overrepresented in proportion to other LGBTQ+ identities Non-Binary gays who feel attatched to the general culture may just feel less of a need to be visible and scream out who they are than non-binary lesbians feel. (Also again may explain why I feel like I see notably more transmasc enby gays because gay transmascs aren't elevated in the same way as cis gays so they likely feel a greater need to shout it from the rooftops)

But still like, even with that and probably some stuff i'm forgetting, it's not like gay communities still don't have a large and deep history of gender non-conforminity that should theoretically lead some to realize they're more than just GNC and straight up aren't men, whether neutral, non-aligned, fem-aligned, while still identifying with the overall culture yeah? Plus as well gay AFAB non-binary people finding comfort there as well. So it feels frustrating and very alienating and lonely that I feel like I see so little of that when it feels like I should see at least a good bit more. That I don't know any history about and specific to non-binary gays especially those who are not at all masc-aligned.

So i'm wondering, does this all or at least parts of it seem right or am I getting stuff wrong here? I in other facets of life also experience alienation and loneliness for who I am being a brown, queer, working class person in a white, wealthy conservative community. So i'm worrying i'm just looking in the wrong places, missing anything, or like subconsciously intentionally doing poor research so I can project my legit feelings of alienation onto somewhere where those feelings would be illegitimate.

TLDR at end.

I have known for about 6.5 years I am non-binary. However, it is only in the past few months that I have seriously thought about it and what it means for me. 

I am not out. Only one person knows (my boyfriend) and I want to keep it that way for a little while at least. I want to gather my thoughts and prepare answers to possible questions before I come out properly. I have ASD and sometimes it can be hard to find the right words (I find writing much easier at times). 

One thing that bothers me is how many people still view non-binary folks as either a man or a woman. I understand that this comes from a lack of knowledge and understanding for many. 

My question is, how do I explain things so that people won't view me as my AGAB anymore?

I'm a 21 year old afab with a C-cup it not big but they're present. Dysphoria hasn't been much of a bother lately but that is probably because of the sweater weather, despite this I still think about surgey often.

2 biggest reasons why I don't like them;

1: they just don't feel like they fit me like thats me you know? When ya look in the mirror and all, I don't mind presenting fem I like to from time to time (reason why I consider just a reduction) but I dress mostly androgynous which feels the most comfortable to me.
2: When people aren't sure what's in my pants instead of asking they look at my chest and it is so fricking uncomfortable.....

My plan atm! Once my country goes out of lockdown I'm planning on going to a personal trainer to get my desired body type aka more muscle which would mean that my breast have a change of becoming less visible! 
But if that doesn't happen I'm very much considering one of these procedures.

My mother is urging me towards reduction if I do so decide to undergo surgery.
On the other hand if I do top surgery I can walk around topless! (Since I sadly enough don't see the 'free the nipple' happening anytime soon..)
I've looked up a lot about both procedures even saw a video which really scared me but despite that I'm still open to the idea. I would love to hear you guys opinions on the matter, I know I'm at a bit of a waiting phase atm just really needed to get this off my chest.

When ya look in the mirror and all, I don't mind presenting fem I like to from time to time (reason why I consider just a reduction) but I dress mostly androgynous which feels the most comfortable to me.\n2: When people aren't sure what's in my pants instead of asking they look at my chest and it is so fricking uncomfortable.....\n\nMy plan atm! Once my country goes out of lockdown I'm planning on going to a personal trainer to get my desired body type aka more muscle which would mean that my breast have a change of becoming less visible! \nBut if that doesn't happen I'm very much considering one of these procedures.\n\nMy mother is urging me towards reduction if I do so decide to undergo surgery.\nOn the other hand if I do top surgery I can walk around topless! (Since I sadly enough don't see the 'free the nipple' happening anytime soon..)\nI've looked up a lot about both procedures even saw a video which really scared me but despite that I'm still open to the idea. I would love to hear you guys opinions on the matter, I know I'm at a bit of a waiting phase atm just really needed to get this off my chest.\n\nThanks for reading this far :)"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Need advice, top surgery or breast reduction?', 'created': 1609380871.0}"

I was wondering if anyone here has had a hysterectomy and would be willing to talk about their experiences.
