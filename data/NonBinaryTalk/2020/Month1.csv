 I really honestly have no clue if I'm just like trans or nb.

Being referred by strangers as he/him makes me feel really happy because it makes me feel like maybe I actually am passing.

However, I tend to feel super dysphoric when strangers refer to me as she/her and it makes me just want to run away and cry.

He always had traits and interests that are considered ""feminine"", it never bothered me, just more things we had in common. Im straight but he always talked really openly  about his sexuality with me and I at least hope that I was always as supportive as possible. 
Yesterday we were just casually talking when he told me he doesn't think he identifies as a man anymore and he just wanted me to know. He was really nervous about it and I tried to reassure him as best as I could that I was ok with it. He specifically asked me to keep on using male pronouns and told me he didn't want anything to change between us or at all, just someone to talk to about this. 
His family doesn't really understand his sexuality and is really awkward about it (though that lessened when he started dating a woman, nobody is surprised smh) and most of his friends are straight and all cis so he doesn't want to come out, ever. 

Idk what to do now. Im just going to treat him as always and see what happens.

Ok, this next part is going to make me sound like a horrible person.
Im not sure wether it bothers him to be ""in the closet"" but I kind of don't want him to come out. There are already so many people looking down on him, and on me for dating him. And I know that this would cause major problems with both of our families. Thought I wouldn't break up with him if he wanted to come out im afraid he is going to ask me about my opinion on this and I absolutely don't want to be the reason he doesn't come out and is miserable but I also wouldn't want to lie to him. And I can't voice this to him or anyone because it could discourage him from coming out. 

And the last thing im worried about is that I am straight, Im attracted to men and im afraid he is going to change to a point at wich I wouldn't be attracted to him anymore and I can't talk to him about this because I wouldn't ever want to be the reason he isn't his truest, happiest self.

With lethargy, for about two weeks, I’ve had insomnia and lethargy. I’ll sleep a straight 12 hours and then feel so tired that I want to pass out at 9-10 pm or even earlier sometimes. I’ve been out of school(break) so it isn’t school stress. And while my family has been pretty overwhelming, not much more than normal, and most of the time a bit less, so idk if it’s them. The only differences in my normal schedule is my aunt is staying over, and she can be really stressful at times because she asks endless conversations about her health, when she’s perfectly healthy, but I’ve been trying to avoid those by primarily staying in my room.

2020-01-10 08:37:05,emo7zt,8,1,"Hi all, I'm an afab enby and my current partner is a cishet male. I have dysphoria about my bust which varies in intensity. I've been considering top surgery for some time now and I've been talking it over with my partner. I sent him a few pics of the after surgery scars and he's recently told me that it challenges his self image.

His reasoning is that because I'm afab that my gendered parts still align with his attraction. Still, he's really supportive and uses they/them and my chosen name. However, the pictures freaked him out a little because they looked very masculine.

He knows that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that dysphoria makes it worse. When we were talking the idea of a reduction came up. He's more comfortable with that idea, understandably. I've been back and forth on the subject. I don't know if a reduction will be enough to relieve the dysphoria and I don't want to have multiple surgeries (so hopefully I'll choose right the first time). I think I'd be okay with breasts small enough that I wouldn't have to wear a bra daily, but the idea of a flat chest does seem more appealing.

2020-01-11 21:02:47,end8eh,3,1,"I’ll start off by saying sorry for my english, it’s not my native language and I’m doing my best.

So when I start cegep, I started questionning a lot. I thought I was ftm trans and start looking for the transitionning. I knew I didn't want all the operations: only the top one. After some months I asked my sister, who is 17 years older than me, how she would see me as a boy. She looked at me and said: ""Who want to be a boy"" and I respond I was questionning myself. She shrugged and answered ""When I was younger, it wasn't that accepted so I probably wouldn't have accepted it, but time have changed and I'll accept you!"" She looked at me, smiled and joked: ""So you'll have a penis?"". It was nice. My friends were supportive and everything.
It was the rest of my family I was worried. My father and mother are separated since I was two so I'm really ok with that. I don't see my father often, but he really likes me, is proud of me and everything. However, I was worried he was going to be deceived.
They both are boomers and have some racist, homophobic and transphobe comments from time to time. While my mom is sometimes super supportive towards these issues, she can be really unsupportive too. When I said to her I was bi at 12, she said I was too young to know and urge me to break up with my girlfriend. When I was 17, she said she didn't care that much, I just had to be happy.
As for my stepfather family... One of my stepbrother is really misogyne. Saying things like ""girls are weaker than boys, they are more dramatic, more expensive and cry more. Boys are strong and not crybabies"" (and my mom agree with that). They often laught at more exentric people and I was really afraid of how they would react.
I had a quebecker book from a serie talking about ""taboo"" subjects in hope of changing things. Two of them are about a ftm guy (the second one is the sequel of the first one). From him being a child to him transitionning. I let it on a table for my mom to see it. She did saw it and asked me in the car if I felt like a boy. I said ""yeah kinda"". She then asked me a lot of questions, one was about the operations. I said I only wanted the top one and she argued that you have to have the bottom one two. I tried to explain that no, you can decide to not have any operation at all and she started arguing. The next day, I was at school, anxious and let's just say it was a bad day. I went to her work, and I was crying. She said I was just confused, that it was a phase. I tried explaining to her that I felt like a boy, but no completly. She said that since I am premature (I stopped my grows at 24 weeks and was born at 27 weeks), it might be an aftermath of my birth, that I must have read things and everything. That if I really was trans, I would have shown sign when I was a kid and that it's either you are trans or not, but no in-between.

When I was a kid, I remember asking my mom if I was a girl or a boy and she said to me that I was a girl. For days after that, I said to myself that I was a boy. When I was around ten years old, I wanted to go to the boys clothing, but my mom never let me. I started having anorexia as well as self harm and some suicide aptemt at 12 years old, it stopped when I was 18 or 19. I'm 21.

I said I wanted to see a specialist. I had one in mind, a lot of people had recommended him to me. She refused (as she was paying because I was not financialy stable and could not afford) and forced me to see another one, a woman specialised in trans people and sexual assault survivor. She was always ignoring the trans subject and try making change my way of clothing myself. I'm only 5 feets and like loose clothing and prefer guy clothings not just because it's ""for guys"", but I find them prettier. She was saying I should wear tight clothes. When I said I wasn't confortable in these kind of clothes, she said I should dress for please other people. When my mother went to the hospital for a cardiac arrest and nobody had told me until someone called at home to asked me if I had news, she tried to convince me I was angry by that (I was not, because I knew it would have caused me a panick attack and they didn't want that). She also didn't believed that I was asexual, constently saying it didn't exist, that all human have sexual needs and that she would fix me. She also said she was the only one who could fix me. After months, I was just so tired. I have a long history of depression and have tinnitus. During this time I fell again into anorexia and had a panick attack. My mom was so mad. I finally stopped seeing this therapist. My mom asked me if I was still ""confused"" and I said ""no I'm a girl"" since I was so tired and didn't want to argue anymore. It was constent arguing at home because of that. My mom was always saying she felt like she did something wrong, one time asked my sister to come with me buying ""clothes for GIRLS"" (she capitalized the ""girls"" word. My sister let me buy whatever I wanted).

It's also during this time that I changed of study program. Going to design graphic to 3D animation. I wrote to my teacher to make sure they would called me the name I wanted (It's almost the same name. Like this exemple: Alexandra -&gt; Alex). They all agreed. I came out at my classmates. Some were a little mocking, others didn't care and some were supportive. I made a friend as we like drawing and wanted to continue in 2D animation and concept art. Still friends. Only problem? He is not supportive at all. Saying that all this gender things is snowflake things and super complicated and that he would never see me as a boy as long as I ""looked like a girl"". During these three years, I start let my hair grows again because I like them like that, even if it make people misgendering me. I learned about non-binary and really found that, yes, that's me.

Now, 4 years after my coming out, 3 years that my mom think that I'm not ""confused"" anymore and I'm still not feel like right. I want to transition, want to have the operation, that didn't change, but feel like I'm scared of letting go my past, changing my name, deceveing my family and having to face their comments. I don't want to be the ""snowflake"", I only want to be happy. I don't want to be that muscular and beefy guy, I only want to be how I see myself.

2020-01-12 19:14:09,enrtyz,2,1,Just a disclaimer I'm gonna be talking/ranting about dysphoria and stuff so if you dont wanna read thats totally okay. So its kinda hard explaining your non binary body dysphoria to someone who has no prior experience to that and I get it. Ive been with this guy for like 3 years now and he still kinda doesn't get it? Like this morning he kept resting his head on my chest and it made me uncomfortable so I told him to stop and he just got kinda moody about it like I hurt him by telling him to stop.

2020-01-15 21:18:13,ep8mc0,0,1,"tw: bullying (about being poor)


Hi!! My name is Cynthia and I'm new here. Excuse me as I ramble/vent a little about my gender identity issues. I'm pretty much explaining how my childhood understanding of gender worked and why it was difficult for me to understand my identity until now at 25 fucking years of age.🤷🏻‍♀️


I have always been a little ignorant about gender stuff bc I identify myself as a woman and that has been enough for me my whole life, so why read about it right?
Yeah, my first contact with queer theory was when I was 14 years old and bored on tumblr. I read a little kinda felt represented a point or two but quickly dismissed it because well, I was still a woman so whatever?? 
I didn't think much about it until about a month ago when I started watching some youtube videos about politics from people who identify as transgender/genderqueer and naturally started thinking about it again. Then these days I saw someone talking about their childhood experiences as a trans person and I thought abt my own as a cis girl and then it hit me. I might be nb? But is that so, or do I just have trauma? 

I was a pretty lonely child. I was poor and my mom did what she could to put me in a private school so I could have the best possible education. It was a pretty cheap one but still, I was the poor kid. Every girl had barbie backpacks and princess notebooks and would make me feel like shit for having cheap, ugly school supplies. I don't remember it but mom said I used to rant daily on my way home about how the girls would point at me because my backpack was green or whatever. That happened a lot until I hit 2nd grade and my dad's alcoholism forced mom to put me in a public school and even after that but whatever. My point is I started to hate feminine girls and femininity. 

In these times I learnt that being feminine meant being bigoted towards not feminine girls. And yes, I was poor but ALSO not feminine. I did not like to dress up, I hated keeping my hair long, I made weird faces when I had lipstick on because I was afraid it would get in my teeth. I also wanted to play with the boys but they would dismiss me. I liked to play ""like a boy"" and had ""boy"" interests and never really got what was the problem with that. All I knew was that girls didn't want to befriend me because I wasn't into girls stuff enough. I made some friends in the following years but I never really felt connected to anyone. I don't remember this trauma but it apparently took a toll on my ability to trust people (that and my family but that's what this post is about).

So you see my problem here, right? I had traumatic experiences that made me ""hate"" femininity and ALSO I wasn't the most feminine of girls in the first place. I mixed the two things together and thought about it as trauma, pure and simple. 

I grew up with an absolute disdain for femininity but, at the same time, did have many feminine interests. I liked playing with barbies and watching her movies (I had a problem with her being blonde and blue eyed too but that's not what this post is about). I just didn't like that she seemed so rich (like my classmates seemed, compared to me). The same went to other cartoons. I always loved when a girl character kinda looked like me and wasn't really feminine (like Jade from the Jackie Chan cartoon). That was nice, I felt validated. BUT I also kinda wanted to perform femininity. 

As a teen I felt more and more obligated to be feminine so I started doing all that girl stuff (makeup, waxing, visiting my local hairdresser and nail salon) but that would KILL me inside. It was boring, it hurt and I didn't really care about the results. I bite my nails since I can remember and for some time I would pick my hair, too (idk why but yeah). I just wanted to keep both short but I ""knew"" I would look ""ugly"" and ""manly"" and people would think I was a lesbian. By the way, because of these issues I grew up terrified of being a lesbian because of what my family and neighbors would talk about them (turns out I was bisexual the whole time 🙆🏻‍♀️). Anyway, often I would also fantasise about being a man, atleast for a day, for various reasons and was REALLY into crossdressing. I don't remember putting on entire outfits but sometimes I would sneak into dad's wardrobe and just try on a shirt or a shoe. Still I didn't think too much of it because ""male"" clothes are boring anyways.

So yeah, about the female gender role, as an feminist adult I just said fuck it all and stopped doing most of these things. Lately though I've been wearing dresses a lot and I wish I were more feminine, this time because... I just want. But it just seems really hard. I don't like wearing makeup and accessories, even though it make me feel nice. I'm just too lazy for that. And that sometimes makes me sad because the other women my age don't seem to find it very hard to do. Also I'm still poor so I can't be as stylish as I would like. I mean, could thrift but even that is too expensive for me sometimes and I'm fat so that makes it harder for me to find cheap stuff in my local thrift shops.

Anyway, last year I was kinda rediscovering myself and for the first time in my life I cut my hair really short and that felt really amazing. I started to think again about crossdressing and gender identities and stuff but didn't see myself as genderqueer because despite all that, I just saw myself as a woman who didn't fit in. But yeah, just an hour ago I saw another one of those posts about genderqueer... stuff and someone talked about non binary women and I was like.... well, shit. If that's not me.

I also remembered one specific thing about my childhood: I used to love the library and read a lot. There was this book, ""A bolsa amarela"" (the yellow bag) about a girl who dreamt of being an adult and a boy. There was more to the story but I don't remember because these two dreams of her resonated so much with me. Also one thing that she said when she first got her bag: that she loved the color yellow because it wasn't either a girl's nor a boy's color. That hit me so hard that for atleast the rest of that year I would want EVERYTHING I owned to be yellow. I even had a favorite dress in that color and I absolutely loved it. I had never felt so validated before.

It's so funny how I just forgot about this event for so long and, though I would remember it from time to time, only today all of these things made sense together in my mind. That is so fucking WEIRD lol

Anyways, sorry if my writing doesn't make sense and for rambling! Just wanted to put my thoughts out there xD please tell me I'm not the only one who was so fucking clueless about my identity for so long! 🤣🤣🤣 (it also happened with my sexual orientation btw)",NonBinaryTalk,I... think I'm non binary?

But yeah, just an hour ago I saw another one of those posts about genderqueer... stuff and someone talked about non binary women and I was like.... well, shit. If that\'s not me.\n\nI also remembered one specific thing about my childhood: I used to love the library and read a lot. There was this book, ""A bolsa amarela"" (the yellow bag) about a girl who dreamt of being an adult and a boy. There was more to the story but I don\'t remember because these two dreams of her resonated so much with me. Also one thing that she said when she first got her bag: that she loved the color yellow because it wasn\'t either a girl\'s nor a boy\'s color. That hit me so hard that for atleast the rest of that year I would want EVERYTHING I owned to be yellow. I even had a favorite dress in that color and I absolutely loved it. I had never felt so validated before.\n\nIt\'s so funny how I just forgot about this event for so long and, though I would remember it from time to time, only today all of these things made sense together in my mind. That is so fucking WEIRD lol\n\nAnyways, sorry if my writing doesn\'t make sense and for rambling! Just wanted to put my thoughts out there xD please tell me I\'m not the only one who was so fucking clueless about my identity for so long! 🤣🤣🤣 (it also happened with my sexual orientation btw)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': ""I... think I'm non binary?

 Although I have some education, at this point in my life pronouns are not something I really need to worry about and I stick within the binary personally. For some context I am a 'trans-man' who uses He/Him / 'passes' / whatever not the point, ya'll heard the spiel. I just go by the logic of someone asked me to use pronouns, I do. Making it not complicated for the person who asked also showing those around me see it as not complicated. I'm good at showing people things, not so great with words. :)

AAAAAAANYWHooo I was hoping ya'll could help with some inspiration. I was thinking of playing with binary code and getting cute that way. But ... ugh. It felt off. So I thought hey, maybe someone has a better idea. Or a visual representation that I am unaware of. I should just ask D:

To give an example of the direction I would like to go is from pride week (Surprised?). We did a stonewall piece which I am proud that my paper (with some push) set aside a special section for something I found important to our local community (which isn't bad.... it's like our Boston Tea Party or something, that's badass). However I felt like they missed an opportunity in that its a story everyone knows. 'New' to them if you will, not new to the LGBT+ community (&lt;-- I tried looking up the whole new one and got lost.... I'm just an old man! D:) . SO? I just made a mini poster around the stone wall story, with people who have contributed to our community throughout history, not JUST stonewall. My hope was a member of our local community, who happens to be of the LGBT+ community, would still see something new too. It's their week after all :)

Basically, I want give my non-binary homies this same outlet. But I want to do it right 

Keep in mind I do not write (\^ as you can probably tell lmao\^) so the story so that stays as written. I haven't even read it yet to be honest.... probably a dude explaining how to use 'They' as singular and not plural n such. That is good enough for me, as people still seem very confused about the subject. But I am sure there will be missed opportunities.

What do y'all think I should do? Is there something that you 'facepalm' whenever reading one of these articles we can poke fun at?

I remember back in the day (old man) articles would ALWAYS (maybe still do) say something along the lines of 'born in the wrong body'. D: I happen to like my body I personally don't see much wrong with it. Understandably that is not true for all transfolk, but neither is that statement. I always felt as if that statement was others trying to justify my transness for me. Because my body with my gender made THEM uncomfortable. It was like brainwashing. At the same time, I DO understand the statement. Its a simplified idea that other people can grasp a bit better.... I suppose. I'm ranting again.....

2020-01-21 03:59:15,erp4ij,4,1,"Hey, I recently started learning about genderqueer and non-binary- I vaguely knew non binary as a thing but never really what it meant.  I always have felt at odds in my own skin because of the societal norms placed on me being AFAB by my family, schools and friends. My mom constantly pressured me (pretty severely) to look more girly- care more about makeup- girl activities etc. I even got to a point at about 14 in my head where I thought maybe I was a boy but even that didn’t completely fit so I kind of abandoned the search and settled in. I’m 26 now and just learned about 2 spirits in the Native American culture (I actually do have Native American blood in me — not a lot but still..) and I had never read or seen something that actually seemed to resonate in my soul with how I see myself, how I feel per say.

2020-01-22 03:52:11,es6f12,19,1,"BITCH IM MAD AS HELL

So Im taking an art history class this semester right.

And the first module is on ancient Egypt. 

(Just a disclaimer I am going off of very limited knowledge here, I am by no means well versed in Egyptian history, but I feel as though I have enough to make some sort of rant about this subject)

One of the pharaohs that my professor highlighted was Amenhotep IV, who later changed their name to Akhenaten when they picked up, moved, and made a new city.

Basically, we all know how consistent Egyptian art was right? All the depictions of people throughout the entirety of the Old Middle and New kingdoms stayed mostly the same. The large eyes, straight lines, very idealistic versions of people, especially for the kings. Men were distinctly masculine and women distinctly feminine.

This pharaoh is like the only one who changed up the way they had themselves depicted. Rather than all the straight lines, they are curvy. They have a longer, more gender-neutral face, thinner eyes, thicker thighs, a softer stomach, rounder butt, tight, high waist, THEY ARE DEPICTED WITH FUCKING BREASTS FOR FUCKS SAKE. Like this pharaoh has themselves depicted almost identically to their wife and daughters. They are depicted wearing more gender-neutral clothes, and in more loving and tender images with their wife and kids.

I did a little research on my own and found out that the way their original name (Amenhotep) was written was with masculine indicators, while the name they gave themself (Akhenaten) removes the male indicators. This bitch straight up made their depictions crazy feminine, changed their name to a more gender neutral name, and MOVED THEIR COURT AND BUILT A WHOLE NEW GODDAMN CITY. And people honestly think they are a CISGENDER KING?!,!.?.!?

My professor continually refers to them as a king and with he/him pronouns, but points out how ridiculously feminine all of the depictions of them are. She kept saying she was going to ask us some questions on what these depictions may mean. I was just WAITING for her to suggest that they might have been nonbinary or transgender. SHE SUGGESTED MENTAL ILLNESS, ALIENS, AND RELIGIOUS SHIT. 

LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS PERSON ISNT CISGENDER.

IM SO MAD YALL.

Like yes, obviously we don’t know for sure because we don’t have a mummy for this pharaoh, BUT  YOU C A N N O T TELL ME THIS PERSON WAS FUCKING CISGENDER.

THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY

WHY the FUCK do historians reach SO GODDAMN FAR to try and ignore the BLATANT FACTS IN FRONT OF THEIR FUCKING EYES proving the existence of trans and nonbinary (and honestly any fucking LGBTQ+ identities) people throughout history. 

THIS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO SEE. And yet until I actually searched up sources that actually looked into their possibly gender identity, everyone in all the sources I saw was out here talking about physical deformities and aliens and illnesses and shit, EVEN ONES THAT THEY ADMIT WERE NOT POSSIBLE GIVEN OTHER FACTS. 

I’m so fucking mad yall Im like shaking. This shit is ridiculous!

2020-01-22 04:02:39,es6je1,3,1,"Hi


You may know me, very well, or not at all. You may know me; because I am the soft one. The quiet one. The one who dresses in soft powder blue sweaters and makeup-stained ripped jeans. The one who’s hair is long and wears eyeliner everyday. The one *who’s a girl.*

Yes, I am female presenting. But that does not make my identity less valid. My entire life I have been told I am a GIRL. Truth be told, I never was a girl in the first place. I am non-binary. i am not on the conventional binary of man and woman. I am me. I don’t even really want a label to describe the idea that I don’t fall on the binary. *I am me*

And my partner. My sweet, gentler partner, he is also non-binary. Yes he uses male pronouns, but he is non-binary and his feelings of masculinity and femininity fluctuate. So please, please don’t ever attack him the way you did again.

Please don’t ever tell us that we cannot be non-binary. That we cannot identify as outside of the gender-binary when we ourselves present as a hetero couple.

You attacked us, called us imposters, liars, fakes. That we weren’t “real” enbies. That, by wearing clothes deemed *too normal,* I must be a girl deep down. That he must be a boy deep down.

You yourself are non-binary. You use they/them, as do I. You wear eyeliner, as do I. You wear pride bands, a subtle sign of your identity. My bag is decorated with pins, streaked with PROTECT TRANS KIDS and LOVE IS LOVE. 

You wear chokers and I do not. You call me fake, spitting into my face for wearing makeup; yet your face is just as covered. You make fun of my sweaters; one of the few barriers between me and my hatred for my body. Claiming that if I were a real enby, I’d be more flamboyant.

You mock my partner, calling him a fake. That if he “really, actually” felt the ever changing waves of femininity and masculinity, that he’d wear dresses and wear lipstick.

But school is a toxic environment. We have both been hurt too much. You and I, him and I, him and you. All of us, have been hurt too much.

I wear sweaters and makeup to feel happy. I feel safe, hidden under soft clothes and I appreciate the way makeup changes my face—but nor am I ashamed of my face when clean.

He wears simpler shirts and jeans, because while he loves dresses and makeup, the only experiences he’s ever had with gender expression at school has resulted in severe bullying and ostracization.

You dye your hair every week. Your kohl lined eyes remind me of grunge bands. Your fingers shake as they tug at the 5 necklaces on your neck, ripped fishnets running down your thighs.

I am sorry. I am not as creative as you. I hope you understand.
