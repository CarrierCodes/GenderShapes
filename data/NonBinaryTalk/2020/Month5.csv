2020-05-01 16:12:31,gbl03k,5,1,"TL;DR—My boobs are my single most “this person is a cis woman” feature, but I like them too much for top surgery. I wish boobs were seen as gender neutral by society :( 

So, I’m still trying to figure myself out, but I’ve been using the umbrella term non-binary to describe my gender identity and it’s been feeling pretty right so far. But I’m still insecure about being and calling myself a non-binary person, because I feel like I’ve had a lot more of a cis experience with life than other non-binary folks and maybe I’m jUsT tRyInG tO bE sPeCiAl or whatever the fuck. I’m sure y’all are familiar with THAT struggle. For context, I just turned 24 and I’m AFAB. 

I never had a realization I was the wrong gender at a young age, I never hated my body because it was the wrong gender (though I did and sometimes still do hate my body plenty for other reasons), I never even considered the possibility I was anything other than cis until the last year or two, and I don’t think I feel gender dysphoria tbh. *But*, I definitely feel gender euphoria when I present androgynously, especially masc-androgynous. And there are some other, NSFW reasons, why I’ve realized I’m probably not cis, but that’s another story. 

Anyway, we’ve now arrived at the crux of the issue, which is that I really like my boobs! Being pan/bisexual I just frickin love boobs in general, and the boobs that are physically attached to my body definitely have a special place in (on top of?) my heart, haha. 

So many other AFAB enbees have top surgery and achieve this beautiful androgynous look, and although I find them really attractive and would love to look that gender neutral, I like my boobs too much to go a similar route for my own body. When I really want to present androgynously I wear a binder, but I don’t feel that *need* to wear a binder like some trans men do. It’s more like the equivalent of putting on a really cute outfit that makes you feel super good about yourself? But I still want to take it off and be in PJs when I get home, y’know? 

To make a wall of text short, does anyone else feel this way? Are there any other enbies with boobs that don’t mind them/like them? If not, is non-binary not quite the right label to apply to myself?

2020-05-03 09:25:45,gcnpxy,0,1,"I really like learning languages! I'm currently learning Russian and am trying to improve my Czech. But, these languages are pretty heavily gendered and I am having difficulty figuring out how to refer to myself when speaking these languages, as a person who uses neutral language and pronouns in English. 

Currently my workaround is a bit inconsistent. In English, I'm neutral. In Czech, I'm masculine. In Russian, I'm feminine... sort of.

I'm taking Russian in university. On the first day of class our teacher had us fill out these surveys to get to know us-- why we're interested in Russian, etc., and the surveys had a space for pronouns. I wrote ""they/them"".

I just assumed it was impossible to use neutral language in Russian and decided to use ""она/её"" in the classwork. Later in the semester, the teacher asked me, since I use ""they/them"" in English, if I would prefer to use ""они/их."" I was like... I can do that??

I'm really curious now about how a nonbinary identity is navigated in Russian, and how common it is. My teacher did not need an explanation from me about why I use these pronouns; she seemed to know. 

When we learned to form past tense verbs, she directed me to use ""-ли"" ending instead of ""-ла"" (""Я слушали музыку."" vs. ""Я слушала музыку."") When we had an exercise describing what our classmates had in their possession, she made a point to address me with ""У их есть..."" instead of ""У её есть...""

It has been an interesting experience actually. My teacher doesn't actually remember to use my correct pronouns in English, but she will correct my classmates when they misgender me in Russian. I never felt grammatically awkward using singular ""they"" in English, but I am a bit conscious of using singular ""они"" in Russian.

It wasn’t a big deal at first, because she mixed up the gender of a couple characters to female when I had a severe lack of female characters, and I was happy with changing them to have a more diverse cast.

2020-05-06 02:28:28,gebjrw,3,1,"Okay, so I haven’t shared this with anyone, and I’m using a different reddit account for this. But somehow, I still feel ashamed and attention-seeking, which I know is weird and illogical.
Basically, I don’t feel like I’m entirely a girl. It’s not even that I’m super tomboyish. But I’m worried I might just be a confused cis. Here’s the rundown of what I’m feeling...
1. I don’t know if this counts as NSFW... Well, here I go. I just won’t use explicit, anatomical language here.
I do not exactly have discomfort with my genitalia, but even though I literally have one, I cannot imagine myself with my female genitalia. I cannot/have no desire to masturbate, and I can only imagine myself with male genitalia. It’s not exactly some awful dysphoria; it’s just apathy, ambivalence, and “foreignness.” 
Yet the idea of something permanent like surgery scares me. Also, I sometimes (in a blatant contradiction of this persevering desire for androgyny and that “middle ground” which has plagued me for a couple of years now) want bigger boobs and desire to be more “womanly.” 
I even wrote a short story for my CW class with my “idealized” self in it last year: I was confident, dressed in a suit-and-tie, and not quite a man and not quite a woman (nobody would be able to tell either way and people just accepted I was somewhere in the middle), but I had male genitalia. Then I felt so bad for putting those kind of thoughts down on paper that I went out of my way to say I wasn’t trans in the story so my readers would laugh it off or something. 
I also have this image of myself with “a mop of boyish curls,” and will write placeholder characters of myself with that kind of hair and an androgynous presentation (that kinda sounds egotistical and childish now that I think about it, jeez; I’m basically writing fanfiction of who I want to be). That being said, very few of these fantasies where I am androgynous/not-quite-a-girl-but-not-quite-a-guy feature any sort of sexual activity. It’s just me being me, doing normal, everyday activities.
I don’t feel like I have a great grasp on my identity right now (which is probably normal for my age tbh), but this version of myself I desire to become isn’t really a girl or a boy. 
2. I do not care much about pronouns. I actually would be fine with they/them, but the social implications scare me. I just know I don’t like he/him. 
Sometimes, I joke about being a man with my parents. About a week ago, my dad half-jokingly replied, “... are you serious?” 
And I felt this twinge of PANIC and shame, which is what set this off. I replied, “Haha, of course!” But as I said that it felt kind of like a lie, even though the only thing I know for certain is that I’m not FTM transgender.
Before all of this, I just thought, ‘oh, gender is irrelevant, it doesn’t matter much because I’m just ME no matter what I look like, etc.” But that reaction kinda proves that thought-process wrong. I care more than I thought. 
3. I tried cross-dressing at college in secret when I was 18 (I’m 19 now btw). It felt good, but I look way to feminine to pull it off. When I looked in the mirror, instead of seeing someone authentically androgynous or boyish, all I could see was this little girl. I haven’t cross-dressed since, especially now that I’m back home. I live with my parents and they’re super conservative. They still like to pretend I’m not bisexual, so I don’t plan on ever bringing this up. 
4. I cannot trust my own perspective on this one. As someone raised by a homophobic conservative father, it took me years to figure out I was bisexual. I was taught that people who are LGBT+ are unnatural, so when I started questioning my sexuality in ninth grade, I absolutely panicked. I thought I was going to hell. I kept quiet, looked it up over and over again, convinced myself I was asexual because at that age I equated “gay = going to hell.” In the end, I couldn’t reconcile my religion with my sexuality, and had to give up Christianity entirely. I only fully accepted that it was okay for me to be bisexual when I was 17. I think I’m finally past all of that internalized homophobia, but it took a lot of time plus me actually meeting other members of the LGBT+ community. 
So I don’t know if these are legitimate NB things, or if I’m overthinking. I don’t want to be attention-seeking. I don’t want to intrude into a space where I don’t belong. However, I know I have internalized issues that I’m still working through because of how I was raised. I also don’t want to have years of panic-attacks and self-loathing because I can’t resolve this.

2020-05-06 19:24:21,geqmif,0,1,"Sorry if I come across sounding awkward. I'm new the platform and I dont really talk about my feelings. 

 Lately, whenever I call myself a woman, I feel like I'm lying. I'm afab and in my 20s. However, these are relatively new feelings that only cropped up when I started questioning my gender identity.

As a young child I felt like a girl. As I've gotten older I feel like I've lost a lot of attachment to my feelings of gender.  Around 9 I started appearing more masculine and even tried to change my name. However I stopped because of severe bullying. (Not sure if this was just a phase or not) As a teen I was paranoid that I would look too boyish and be harassed again. Now as an adult, I feel very comfortable with my natural need to appear more andro. This lead to me questioning my gender and such.

I'm new the platform and I dont really talk about my feelings. \n\n Lately, whenever I call myself a woman, I feel like I'm lying. I'm afab and in my 20s. However, these are relatively new feelings that only cropped up when I started questioning my gender identity.\n\nAs a young child I felt like a girl. As I've gotten older I feel like I've lost a lot of attachment to my feelings of gender.  Around 9 I started appearing more masculine and even tried to change my name. However I stopped because of severe bullying. (Not sure if this was just a phase or not) As a teen I was paranoid that I would look too boyish and be harassed again. Now as an adult, I feel very comfortable with my natural need to appear more andro.

I have always felt disconnected to my gender that was assigned to me at birth (female) I never fit into the feminine mould that my parents, friends and society wanted me to be and I always beat myself up for it. 

I also have had traumatic experiences from men my whole life so the definition that I made in my mind of the men was always negative and I never wanted to be or be near any men, and because of this even when I gained knowledge of the trans community I still felt I didn’t fit in because I felt I shouldn’t be a man. 

Now fast forward to present time, I am doing much better for myself and have found an amazing partner who is a trans man, and he has let me have the ability to explore my gender and sexuality in a safe and comfortable environment that let me realize and come out as non-binary. 

I now wear a binder and shaved my head! I love feeling masculine while still obtaining my natural feminine qualities. my only problem is coming 
out to my people which I know will never be easy so I have turned to you guys for some help, tips and good things to say for when I decide to come out to my peers.

2020-05-07 08:56:57,gf306e,4,1,"We were chatting about how when we were in HS (we're 30) people were less open about being NB, and I came right out and said,.""I think you might be non-binary, at least a little."" 


He basically sighed and said ""Yeah, I know.""


A little background- we've been together 8 years and the last several he's been more open with me about a few things that have led me to believe he's not entirely... I apologize for not knowing the right term, but gender-conforming? For example, he likes to wear my clothing (underwear, tank tops) casually and has some of his own. He also likes it when I refer to him by female pronouns during sex. He has made comments that made me believe that he experiences gender dysphoria on multiple occasions. I've tried to make it as comfortable and casual for him to express himself as possible. I'm really all for it. But more recently it dawned on me that his comments and behavior might go beyond getting kinky. So to hear him come right out and say that yes, he's not totally cis, was huge. 


After he replied to me I held him and told him that everything was okay and I was glad he told me. We talked a little bit more- I asked if he could please put his experiences into words. He said he was afraid to fully delve into it. He suffers from low self-esteem and according to him, he was worried about embracing the part of him that feels non-binary for fear that it would make him feel worse about himself. I asked him if he could please try to be more open about his feelings with me, at his own pace. He agreed, then rolled over and fell asleep lol. 



So it was very casual and warm, although I feel badly for him being scared of his feelings. I wish he felt secure enough to just be fully himself. That would be wonderful. I want to keep talking about this. I have had to coax him many times over the years to be open with me, and typically the results have been good, but I would like to handle that delicately. I think he knows I am absolutely 100% okay with however he identifies, and I will continue to remind him he has my support.

2020-05-12 18:49:59,gihmpg,2,1,"Hello!! 

I dont know why it took me so long to join the nonbinary subreddits here...

Uh so I've been out as trans for 8 years, specifically nonbinary for 6. In the beginning I had my heart set on medically transitioning (top surgery, HRT) but life events through that out the window for a while. 

I started dating a straight cis man when I was about 17 and the only way I could describe it is compulsory heterosexuality grabbed me by the neck and has had a steady grip on me for years to come. (More so after we broke up)

It's only recently that I've sat down and really had a heart  to heart with myself on who I am, am I happy with where I am in my transition? I've realized the thing that's held me back from going on HRT has been the fear of what people will think of me, if people I'm attracted to will still be attracted to me instead if ya know... is this what I want to look like?

I've come to the conclusion that no? I'm not happy... I've talked to friends who are supportive, even sat down with my mom and she said even if at the end of the day I decide not to go through with it, ita better to have talked to my doctor and have that door open then it be closed forever. 

Now my only issue is my partner? He is a cis straight man who is all around very open minded and accepting, I have no doubts he supports me nk matter how I present but in the beginning of our relationship when I brought up HRT he made a point to apologize and say he wasnt sure he'd still be attracted to me if I went on it (I dont blame him for this nor am I upset about this, people are attracted to certain things physically and that's okay, I dont want to force him to stay if hes no longer attracted to me??) 

I just dont know how to bring it up with him? I dont want him to be upset but I also dont wanna keep delaying me feeling horrible about myself...  

Any advice on how to talk about it? What points to bring up if he asks why, or if I have to??

Hello fellow non binary folk, so I came out to my parents as non binary a few months ago, and last month told them about my new name. They did the usual ""its going to take us some time to get used to it, but we love you no matter what.""

Fast forward to yesterday, they came over (my bird passed away and I'd had her for 7 or so years so I was upset) I brought up the fact that my sister in law texted my husband asking if he was ok with my name change (he is, he's super proud of me) and my mum decided that was a great time to say ""well we haven't talked to him about it either"" (like it's any of their business anyway) the went on about how she was in denial and didn't want to use my deadname, which really hurt. Then today my husband comes home from work (he and my mum work in the same building) saying that when he used my new name to my mother and then left the room she turned to a colleague and mutual friend of his and said ""i refuse to call her that"" and her mood turned from normal to angry very quickly after he used my name. 

So long story short, my parents don't actually support me and have been lying to my face and bitching to people I know behind my back. So I'm done now, I wouldn't be mad if I never spoke to them again and I never thought I would get to that point.

Is this normal? I realised I was trans about five years ago (I'm AFAB) and went through a ftm gender transition. Two years on t and top surgery a year ago. I was so uncomfortable as a woman and so euphoric when I could finally transition but now I'm starting to question that (I'm 26 and my life is finally going ok)

My fiance is AMAB and recently came out to me as NB, he presents like a long haired bearded femme guy and uses he/him pronouns. I'm wondering if I might be the same? Or if maybe I'm kind of fluid and feeling like a girl sometimes? 

The scariest thought is that I might regret transitioning. I'm not buying into the TERFy bs and I know it's really uncommon to genuinely regret it. But I'm wondering if I might and what to do if so. I'd just be a girl without boobs and with a deeper voice, but now I feel so good with my new muscles and broad shoulders and narrower hips and more angular build. I used to be super curvy and hated it. But in saying that I've had an ED for 15 years and I'm wondering if I wasn't dysphoric so much as dysmorphic. 

I'm wondering if it's partially because I had such nicer interactions with queer women than queer men. I know it's not representative but the queer men I've known have rarely been decent whereas most queer women are amazing. I'm bi and identified as a bi woman for about five years. I miss the solidarity of queer women compared to the pettiness and nastiness and judginess of the queer men I know. 

Does anyone have any advice? Have any of you been through anything similar? I thought I was finally done doubting myself but now it's back again and I don't know what to do.

2020-05-23 04:17:57,goylku,6,1,"I have been feeling really confused as of late... My identity has always veered towards the less feminine and ever since I found nonbinary, it has felt very correct for me. My sexuality and attraction though, have been very confusing. Growing up I was always attracted to men and it wan't until I was an adult I realized my attraction to women and nonbinary people. After so many years I have started to reevaluate my attraction to men - is it real or is it rooted in a societal expectation? Maybe a mixture of both?

I have a couple of hoodies with my deadname on (school leavers, and student union rep) that I am attached to, and like to wear casually around the house or my university accomodation, if not in public very often.

Storytime.

So my bf is transmasc nb and he has been using T for a while now. I was so happy for him, seeing how the testosterone changed not only his appearance, but also his confidence. I kept commenting on how masculine he looked over and over again (which might have been overkill to begin with), because I was so excited and I wanted to let him know that the changes were noticeable. 

But recently he told me that he felt dysphoric from the effects of T. Now feel awful for commenting on his appearance so frequently. For some reason I was convinced he wanted to transition ""fully"" (ftm) even though I knew he was nb. 

I try to avoid gendered compliments all together now. I try to stick to ""cute"" and ""attractive"", call him my boyfriend but I throw in a ""partner"" every now and then, etc. 
I don't want to bother him too much about this issue, because I don't want to force him to think about his appearance, thus triggering his dysphoria. But I want to know what's usually a big nope in this case (like heavily gendered remarks), and what's usually appreciated.

I started coming out in February. I feel like I definitely had a honeymoon period where I was like finally, ok, this is going to be great, I can actually start living my life. And that honeymoon period is definitely over. 

I live in a very conservative cowboy state but I'm in a college town so that makes it a little easier. But I don't have any trans friends and don't know where the trans/nb people here are... like I hope they exist but I don't know where they are. I was going to try to go to my school's lgbt group but then coronavirus happened. 

So I'm just very very lonely and don't feel like any of my friends really ""get it."" I feel like the general vibe is ""ok.... now prove it"" because I haven't really done a single thing to back my transness up other than change pronouns. But I still hear she and I know that I just look/act like a girl in everyone's eyes and that kinda makes me want to take a nap for a century

And it makes me really sad because I look at my face or body and I see a genderless nonbinary body, but I know that everyone perceives me as a girl. I don't want to cut my hair, I love having long hair. I'm struggling to find men's clothes that fit me especially since I've been buying things off poshmark. I don't feel like a very masculine person. I want to channel feminine androgyny, but if that's not possible I want to be read as a feminine man, but that's never going to happen without at least hormones.

I feel like I can say I don't have dysphoria but that's because I'm so disconnected from my body that I can't feel it. But when I really start thinking about it I get so dysphoric and it's so so bad. It's really really been getting to me lately, like SO bad. The more time I spend with the idea of hormones/top surgery the more I really want it. But then I immediately want to go back on that statement because even that doesn't feel right. 

I wish I could just reset and be born with a flat chest and a penis and no curves and go from there. But then maybe I would want boobs and be in the exact same situation, I don't fucking know.

Anyway. I could go on and on about my family and how terrifying it is to think about dating and etc etc etc but you know.

I'm just so so discouraged right now. And so isolated from any kind of genuine understanding or support. I don't have any kind of physical tangible community to be a part of and that's so lonely.

I use to skip the monthly week as long as I can, but my body is stubborn, so I still end up with one about every 2 months. I'm so pissed, because I started to bleed again the other day, so I have to take a week off the BC or else it will never stop. But my dad decided to buy stuff at an auction that's 5-6hours away with limited to no bathroom stops bc of covid. I tried getting out of it, but he wouldn't listen.

I don't want to tell them what's going on because it's embarrassing and extremely hard for me to talk about. I don't want what to do. I'm currently having a break down and can barely breathe. I'm really having bad cramps and heavy bleeding. They aren't gonna lighten up anytime soon. I don't know if I can do this car ride. He bought heavy shit and needs help carrying it. I told him I didn't wanna go and to take my 14 y/o brother but he said he won't be able to carry anything. 

It's f***ing ridiculous, last time I had to have a period we had an auction to go to that was 18 hours away, and that totally did not go well either. The time before that I was also on it, too! WTF is up with him managing to schedule these each time I have a failing body and crippling dysphoria??? 

I hate these organs. It's so mentally and physically exhausting.

I was thinking about telling my mom but she leaves super early so maybe I could text her and tell her to tell my dad to bring my bro because of what's going on but then she'll make those side comments ""oh that's why you're being so emotional"".

Due to Corona having us all on lockdown and working from home I’ve had a lot of time to think and try and get to grips with my head. I’m trying to figure out my gender identity and it’s confusing and I’m going from the beginning but I’d like your advice and support if you didn’t mind.

I can’t remember how old I was (I’m 24 now) but I remember watching Eddie Izzard and he was wearing a dress with breast forms and such and he looked really good, really confident and looked like he was loving it. I instantly took to that idea and remembered thinking that I wanted to be like him but I was never too sure about it, I tried coming out to parents but stopped myself. That was 8 years ago. 

I’ve toyed with women’s clothing where I can and I’ve enjoyed it however er none f it has properly fit me before, so I guess I don’t actually know. When I came out as gay I thought that was it however I still kept looking at women and was envious of what they had (the figure, chest, make up, dresses you get the point) and have been suppressing these thoughts for a few years. 

I then started watching critical role and saw the actor Taliesin Jaffe and he would quite often wear his nails painted and that sent me right back on the thought trip and I’ve been on and off but I’ve had so many other things going on to think about. I then also started watching queer eye and JVN caught my attention for the way they dress  and identify.

2020-05-31 22:39:30,gu8lx4,20,4,"we had a belated birthday celebration for me today and it’s been about a month since I’ve come out. I tried to have a conversation after they sang happy birthday (because they deadnamed me) about how important it is to me that they try to use my pronouns and my name. 

my name they have always said they will try. but they/them pronouns? absolutely not. 

they are so against they/them pronouns they’re not even willing to try to use them. and I tried to explain how singular they/them pronouns are used and my dad lost it saying “If I want you to pick up your shoes, what do I say? THEY pick up your shoes????” and I was just like...you wouldn’t use a pronoun in general in that sentence tho??

it was just a really bad situation and I tried explaining how if they love and support me, they will try and if they won’t even try, that means they’re transphobic. my sister went on a whole thing about how she’s not transphobic because she “knows herself” lol 

anyways, has anyone else had similar experiences?
