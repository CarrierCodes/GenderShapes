Ive (24) been out as Non-Binary for 6-7 months. I have a chosen name, and pronouns (they them). Ive always felt like I was non-binary. My partner of over a year (28 cis-male) has known these feelings since we started dating, and even helped me pick my new name. 

But, the problem is, he keeps deadnaming me. Which is not fine, but I know everyone takes time to get used to name changes. But, its been months. He says jokingly that hes ""just stupid"" and that I shouldnt be bothered by it. And just generally downplays my feelings. Even though he deadnames me multiple times a day. On top of this, he also uses the wrong pronouns. 

However, I want to call bullshit on that. We have a roommate who came out as trans 2 months ago, and he has had no problem using her name and pronouns and has not deadnamed her once. In general, he is really good with his trans friends (we have quite a few, his own brother is trans). Even his ex, who is also NB, he uses their pronouns and chosen name. 

Its frustrating because, its like he respects everyone else but me. If anyone has any advice on how to overcome this, I would appreciate it.

2020-09-02 01:10:34,ikx5hv,26,1,"I'm a bit anxious and dysphoric now and it would be good for me to vent and receive some support please.

I asked in a gay subreddit if someone knew a term for ""gay"" queer/NBs, I mean, who are attracted to men but aren't men, just feel more comfortable with GBT+ men than straight men.

Also it was my first time telling that I'm AMAB (that's why I have this alt account, it's not something that I like to say) and then everybody just started assuming things and these were the kind of responses that I had, ONLY for asking if there's a neutral gay term:

&gt;If you‚Äôre a male attracted to other males then you‚Äôre gay
*I'm not a male*

&gt;This question makes no sense. You are a man attracted to other men but you don't want this to be called gay? Smells like homophobia to me.
*I'm not a man*

&gt;This identity thing seems to be a kind of hell for some of you. Follow your cock. The verbiage can wait.
*Maybe my identity and respect is more important for me than sex*

&gt;How about you just ignore the NB bullshit and say you're gay. If you're identifying as something yet doing nothing to make yourself appear more like what you're identifying as then what's even the point other than to put another precious oppressed label on yourself
*How does he know how do I look like? I never said I look masculine, feminine or androgynous*

&gt;The point is for attention and to make yourself seem more special than you actually are.
*Ok we're special snowflakes but people that tries to argue even if I said that I wouldn't argue, aren't snowflakes*

It sent me into this crisis of confusion cause I still like feminine things, pronouns, and the like. Soon I started identifying as demi girl, it was alright. 

Last month was I drinking and it just like hit me, I was getting this absolute joy from being called they/them and a few friends calling me NB. So I was just like yes this feels right. I don't want a gender, I am me. No gender binary to hold me back. I've been wearing less makeup, wearing big t shirts and not wearing bras, tucking my hair into beanies more, and it's been good!! 

Then I started feeling discomfort. I have been thinking about cutting my long hair and trying to go more androgynous looking. To feel better about pet names I still love I have started thinking of the word girl as gurl or grrrl to feel different from just being female but still having something I love, a term of endearment instead of gendering. But I've started to get uncomfortable about not being a girl? I looked at old photos of myself with makeup and it made me so uncomfortable to look at myself rn. So I quickly put some on to maybe feel better. It kinda did, it was familiar and comforting but I was also still uncomfortable with the way I look. It wasn't until I pulled my hair back that I felt better but still didn't feel like I looked like myself. 

I've never had a mental connection to my real image. When I think of myself it's not my physical look.

I'm about to cut my hair and see what happens, maybe actually stepping into a more NB look will feel better than just thinking about it. Possibly changing my makeup style could help. I have nothing wrong with my body, I love it even. Tho it's a bit harder to go androgynous and buy men's clothing when you're short and chubby, but I still don't want to change it. I think all my discomfort is my face.

My mind constantly tells me that each small thing I don't like on me that is masculine [ I have condition one of the things it make is make my face have more facial hair and only in one side I don't like it and my brain tells me it means I am not trans ] makes my brain attack me by telling me this means I will be wrong to have TOP surgery when I really want it. I can't use my name and pronounce with people I know because my brain is telling me I lie to them [ I love and feel euphoric when people I don't know use he/him /boy ect ]Each time I say other name than what I currently think is mine my brain tells me I lie that this is it I must abandon this and go back to be girl

I feel euphoria when I imagine who I can be but because I know I will never achieve the perfect look and I dobt me being real .I wait for strong dysphoria to show so I can feel valid and feel trans enough to want ro change without being 1000% sure [ I have fluctuating dysphoria that sometimes shows as depressionalisation and depression] I have days when my binder makes me feel terrible because it reminds me that I am fake that what others see isn't me that I am Impostor and will never be me 

I feel numb sometimes walking outside when I look at people and all people look wrong for me like how guys can let gain weight and belly and man boobs ect and look kind of butch and how woman go out knowing how they look ....as if I am ghost that just walks  without being seen I feel empty as if nothing will make me feel myself. I know they aren't ugly or something just I feel this way. Same when I see myself looking like butch lesbian short square body short hair ect makes me feel it will be better to have long hair just not to look butch because my ideal is skinny androgenous person and I know I will never be  on I must pick and I can't because I don't even know my label or name ...

2020-09-04 11:28:40,ime88z,13,1,"Hello everyone, I, eh, I don't know how to start. Well, I just try. I am so sorry if I offend anyone by my word usage, I am completely new to this.

I have recently got the problem of questioning my gender, if I am my biological gender(female) or if I am nb or even genderfluid.

I have since puberty a big problem with my body because it just screams: ""I am woman!"" Because it's very curvy and thick. Since I am an endomorph, it will be forever like this, even if I do sports and it simply gives me depression. I can't sometimes look at myself in the mirror. My body also looks very mature that's why people often mistaken me older than I am and I always felt bad so much. I was a child and I wasn't an adult woman. I always wanted an ectomorphic body, where I have thin limbs, small chest and hips and just could crossdress by possibilities. I wanted to look androgynous. But since my body is so very female, everything I want to wear feels like shit, my figure always pops out of place, I don't feel comfortable wearing my favourite clothes or any clothes and also afraid of trying the new one I never wore because it always disappointed me. And if I do wear something to cover it up, it gives me depression to because it makes me feel far. Hell, I feel bad if I wear shorts in public, because I am so ashamed of my thick legs. I often compare other legs to mine and this makes me even more sad.

In school I felt so bad because all of my classmates were so skinny, I was questioning, ""why I am the only one who is so curvy?""

Whenever I had to put on make up or a dress, I had a mental breakdown, my mom shout at me everytime i cried when she put make up on me, I couldn't see myself like this, I was just bursting to tears I hated it, I wanted to wash away. My mom is nice, but recently I had such big issues with her. She says ""Homo and Trans people can do what they want as long it doesn't affect us."" My bf is trans, I had such a big war with her. I won't give him up, I am so sorry for him, that he had to go through this hell caused by my mom. She even gave me an ultimatum: ""Whether him or me."" Hell, she didn't even use the right pronouns.  And I don't think she will understand me but instead ""cure"" me and ""this because of him"". I hate to talk bad about my mother and I never talk what happens at home but I feel so bad. 

On the internet I usually don't tell anything about me (besides now, because I really need help), not my age, name, preference or gender. I am always scared if somebody asks for my gender, much people in a public forum thought I was male, and, I don't know, this made me happy. As they called me he/they. Or as I was at an anime con, I lost some weight and had the courage to cosplay a young boy and some people did thought I was a boy or 13 years old, and I don't know, it made me feel so much better.

I don't think anybody in my environment would also understand if I become nb/gq. My best friend that lives a bit away, says it's okay. And my bf either. He says he doesn't cares what I am, he loves me anyways. That gives me a bit hope. 

Last month I was thinking very much of this, if I am or not. I discussed this with my psychologist. She said I should try to live out this but I am too shy for this. I also experienced heavy issues with my body again, I often lie in bed the whole day, have nightmares, sometimes images infront of me how I cut my cheek or two people fighting each other and both should be me. The one attacks the other takes it all. I am always about to cry and exhausted.

I have cut my hair after I finished school to leave it all behind. I felt better. Last month I dyed my hair white/ platinum blonde. I felt better. I felt worse when my hair would grow long again (I have chin long hair), I was thinking about a more androgynous hair cut but I was afraid, it wouldn't look good and this would be kicking me in my hole again.

I do sometimes feel good to be a girl. In a relationship for example. But I sometimes have days where I don't. I sometimes feel strange, like today I feel different, not girl but boy, and somedays just like -blop - I am nothing. I carry always an umbrella, I have several different one, so I thought, why not to try this small white blue cat one when you feel female, this long rifle like one for storms when you feel male/nb. I become anxious when I am doing ""too good"" without having to constantly thinking something is wrong with my gender. That, that I am just making things up, because I seek a way to break out of me. Or just seek where I can belong. Tbh, when I watched something with lgbtq+ it often gave me depression, I mean, I was happy for the people but I felt like I don't belong there. I mean, I think I am pan? I don't know, this is so confusing. Maybe I just wanted to be a part of this. And yet I am afraid to offend people to think: ""Yeah, I am"" and then ""haha, sike"". 

I had the thoughts before that I might be nb/gq, but simply put it away. ""It's not this, this is stupid, just live the girl you are, you don't need this extras in life.""
Nowadays I am triggered when somebody calls me ""Miss"" sometimes. My bf said, that this isn't good putting it aside. We have a distanced relationship. I told him when he was at my place a month and a half ago. Since than I started to distance myself again, I felt guilty for having this body, I didn't want to give it to him so he had to bare with this. Everytime when I lied in bed and thought about hugging, I felt so atrocious, he shouldn't have me and body as such a heavy burden, I feel so bad when he have to touch this, it made me cry. 

I don't like to talk to him or anyone about this topic so I lock it up, talk about my psychologist. Sometimes to my bestie and now I open up here. We do have in the city where you physically can meet up to club for queer people but it's far and I am scared. So, I am here.

If you go for invasive surgery of any kind be sure not to shave, cut or trim your body hair of the area that's undergoing surgery for at least a week. Many hospitals will decline your surgery last minute if they notice! It's because you might cause micro tears in your skin which will collect bacteria. When the surgeon then makes the incision during surgery these bacteria can infest the wound and cause serious complications in a minority of cases.

Almost happened to me, luckily they were lenient with me. I always shave all of my body hair except my head to alleviate dysphoria at least twice a week. I asked the nurse whether they don't get this problem with girls a lot and she was like""did you just out yourself as a girl?""

2020-09-06 13:12:46,inlrvi,6,1,"I know this is a subreddit specifically for non-binary topics, but I thought maybe someone here has/had a similar experience?

I'm AFAB, and for the longest time I've always disliked presenting feminine. There were times that I wished that I were born a guy, and on the internet I do my best to present masculine. But the thing is, despite wishing I was born a guy, I don't want to transition into one. It would've been nice if I was a boy from the start, but since I was born a girl, I don't.. particularly want to transition? I'm fine with being a girl and I'm fine with people who see me irl (whether it be strangers or someone close to me) calling me she/her and such.

The thing is though, on the internet, if someone correctly guesses she/her, I get sad. I guess it's like, since they're not seeing what I look like and yet still correctly guess she/her, it makes me feel that I didn't present masculine enough online. I keep my pronouns hidden with the hopes that people would mistake me as a guy. When people online refer to me as he/him, I don't correct them. If anything, I feel giddy and happy, as if it's almost like a guilty pleasure or something. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I personally wouldn't label myself as male or put he/him in my bio, but if someone were refer to me as being male or he/him, I wouldn't correct it.

I've thought about maybe being non-binary since I'm distant from femininity, but that doesn't really feel right either. I should clarify that, with people who are close to me + acquaintances, I want them them to use she/her. For me, it would feel weird if they used he/him or they/them or called me by another name. It might be a ""worried about stigma"" thing, but again, I don't feel sad or offended by the people around me calling me female; I'm okay with identifying as female around them. The reason why I say I don't really think non-binary is the right label is also because if people on the internet were to see me as non-binary, that doesn't... really give me the same happiness I feel from being called he/him?

Like, err, recently I became acquaintances with an online friend group (no one in the group is anyone I know irl) and when introducing myself, I used he/him instead of the usual she/they or ""any pronouns"" and it felt... really nice?? Like, it felt liberating almost. I know gender =/= pronouns, but I know they would see he/him and likely view me as male or at least masculine, and the thought of that really made me happy.

Recently, I saw a cute drawing from this genderfluid person who described their different genders. One was labeled ""The Female Me"", which is how they present with their female friends. One said ""The Non-Binary Me"", which is how they present when they're at work or with their male friends. And one said ""The Bigender Me"", which is how they present when they're with someone very close. Seeing the drawing made me think of myself. When I'm with female friends, I'd be okay with presenting both as a feminine or as a masculine girl (I wouldn't mind wearing skirts, but I probably still wouldn't wear anything girly or frilly). When I'm with my family, male friends, or most anyone I have some sort of relationship with (i.e. coworkers, etc.), I want to only present as being masculine/androgynous, but while maintaining she/her (so possibly non-binary but with she/her pronouns? though, I probably wouldn't tell most people that I'm non-binary, I'd probably just be female). And when I'm with online strangers or in general how I present to the general public, I want to be called he/him (I would be okay if someone called me she/they, but I would vastly prefer he/him). This could be me presenting as bigender? Or at the very least, masculine leaning. I would be okay with people referring me as being any gender, and I would be okay with presenting both feminine and male aspects of myself (i.e. talking to some people in a girl-ish way, but in general I'd talk/act in a masculine way), I would just vastly prefer being called a guy or being called he/him.

To summarize it, I experience different things depending on who I'm with. I wouldn't call it gender dysphoria per se, but a close friend calling me she/her and an online stranger calling me she/her would elicit different emotional responses. I don‚Äôt know if a label like non-binary would fit me because even if someone were to call me male/female, I wouldn‚Äôt feel upset (and I want to be called male in some cases), which is why I‚Äôm thinking I might be bigender or genderfluid? I guess I'm asking because it seems that for a lot of genderfluid people, their gender differs based on day and not based on who they're with? So I didn't know if genderfluid was the right word, or if what I'm feeling/experiencing has a different label.

This conversation has had me reeling for days. I attempted to just wear a bra instead of my binder with my masc presenting clothes and I cried from being so angry and frustrated with myself. 

Why can't I be the normal they want. Why can't I be happy in my body?

Pair that with my parents comparing my wanting top surgery to plastic surgery for cosmetics...

I had the means to talk to some non binary people who really clarified my doubts and they were super nice and supportive.

I took some time off to really understand and starting to accept my identity, so far so good, and I came out to some of my friends who had no problems with that and I‚Äôm so happy about that. I also put my pronouns (she/they) in my insta bio and it feels good.

I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist, mainly for other issues with my mental health, but I don‚Äôt feel like talking about my gender since she [my psychiatrist] knows my parents and I‚Äôm not ready to come out yet (plus only my mom knows about me being queer, I think my dad knows that but I never had this kind of conversation with him), I know that *technically* she shouldn‚Äôt say anything, but I don‚Äôt want to risk it.

I wanted to talk her through sending me to a facility where they treat my kind of issues, sort of psych ward but not really, and talk to the psychologist/psychiatrist who work there about my identity, hoping they understand it.

I think I most likely have period dysphoria (if it‚Äôs a thing), the thing is that I haven‚Äôt had periods for more than a year due to pcos and I‚Äôm actually terrified it‚Äôs going to come back at any given moment.

My chest dysphoria is always there, last week I went to the beach and I spent most of the time swimming/diving and it was fine as I couldn‚Äôt see my breasts. 

As I said in my previous post, I was thinking about getting a binder but I don‚Äôt know where to buy it.

2020-09-10 23:31:51,iqf01n,3,1,"hey all. i'm not sure if this is the place to post this. i have some questions about the intersection between psychology/psychoanalysis and non-binary experiences. rant ahead:

my identity in general has always fluctuated a lot. in particular, i started questioning my gender identity (afab) around when i was 15. i'm 20, almost 21 now.

this questioning has meant experimenting with haircuts, clothes, etc. i was always very uncomfortable with the fem clothes i had as a teen. i feel like i have now kind of found my groove wearing looser sweatpants, longer sweaters, beanies, shirts buttoned up, short hair, etc. when i try to explain these things, even (especially) to myself, they get muddled. do i like short hair because it's more masc? what does masc even mean? just how useful/interesting are those two items, from a binary categorization? these are more general questions.

anyways, over the past 3-4 years i've felt more and more disconnected from my chest. sometimes it's on the more aesthetic side (how i look), sometimes it's more on the experiential side (how i/they feel). while my (self-diagnosed) dysphoria is overall chill, at some points, it's gotten to be pretty bad, causing a kind of dissociation. i don't want these things on me, they feel external, as if they had been placed on me without my agreement. 

in that line of thought, i have been considering and thinking about top surgery. this had always been around my headspace, but i only seriously started to consider it this july. because of covid, and being on a trial period for a new job (which means i can't take any days off until the end of the year), i probably wouldn't be moving forward with this, if i wanted to, until beginning of 2021, as in actually going to see the surgeon and talking about the surgery. i had a videoconsultation with another surgeon who gave me a general overview and was very nice about everything. it got me really excited, and it was simultaneously really calming to see that there *are* things one can do to feel better. it was also calming to realize that no one is rushing me: i feel more comfortable giving myself another couple of months to think about it before actually making a decision.

now to my actual question. i've been in therapy, psychoanalytic therapy, for the past 2 years-ish. i live in buenos aires, so i think undergoing analysis is much more common here than elsewhere (something like 70% of people are in psychoanalytic therapy).

my chest dysphoria and overall discomfort with my gender identity has been peppered in throughout my analysis, from the very start. my analyst knows that being uncomfortable with my chest is not something new. however, for the past couple of sessions, since i told her that i am considering top surgery, i have been getting a vibe that i feel as dismissive/questioning (in the bad sense of the word). once, she said something like ""could it be too much mother""? she was linking ""mama"" (as in breast) to ""mam√°"" (as in mom). i thought it was one of those eye-rolly psychoanalytic reductionisms. the way she got there was tied to something about rules (which she had brought up, not me). the session after that, i asked her what she meant, what the ""it"" in ""could it be ..."" was.

when i pressed her to explain the link between what i had been talking about regarding top surgery and ""rules"", she ended up asking something like: is this a rule you want to break for spite/just because/*against* the rule (so, against the rule's status as that)? or do you want to go *for* something, which implies breaking a rule (more against the rules content)?

i assumed the ""it"" in ""could it be ..."" was my identity. i felt hurt and dismissed because it felt like she was equating any gender experience i had to my mom's effect on me, as if that were some kind of direct explanation, and i couldn't account for anything i felt. i know that that's only how i respond to what she says, but it's really making me curious. 

her question about the reason for rule-breaking kind of threw me off. growing up, i had a specific tendendy to break rules for fun. if someone told me don't do x, i would go and do it, even if i had not previous intention of doing that. my 5th grade teacher baptized me as ""rebel without a cause"". as a young adult, i guess that's been sublimated into an enjoyment of playing devil's advocate in intellectual discussions, for example, but i would say i am now a person who follows rules (maybe too much).

a couple of disclaimers: 1) i've translated our conversation, which took place in spanish, so there might be things left out/included externally because of that 2) i know it depends on many case-by-case factors that only analyst and analysand as parties in an analysis can get to know (things i couldn't possibly include in a reddit post).

psychoanalytic-inclined folks, especially those with a gender perspective, what are your takes on this? where does one draw the line between old-fashioned, conservative psychoanalysis and it's somewhat rotten take on gender, and someone actually asking the right questions?

one part of me thinks that all these questions that popped up are a good sign, and that the analysis is being steered in an interesting way (if i care so much, there must be something behind this). another part of me thinks that the hurt and anguish these interventions cause in me cannot be for the best of me. i am sad/angry/tired of hearing that kind of dismissive discourse, and did not expect this from her (i know she is involved in several ""progressive"" circles).",NonBinaryTalk,questions about the intersection between psychology/psychoanalysis and NB experiences,1599805911.0,"{'created_utc': 1599780711, 'id': 'iqf01n', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'hey all. i\'m not sure if this is the place to post this. i have some questions about the intersection between psychology/psychoanalysis and non-binary experiences. rant ahead:\n\nmy identity in general has always fluctuated a lot. in particular, i started questioning my gender identity (afab) around when i was 15. i\'m 20, almost 21 now.\n\nthis questioning has meant experimenting with haircuts, clothes, etc. i was always very uncomfortable with the fem clothes i had as a teen. i feel like i have now kind of found my groove wearing looser sweatpants, longer sweaters, beanies, shirts buttoned up, short hair, etc. when i try to explain these things, even (especially) to myself, they get muddled. do i like short hair because it\'s more masc?

2020-09-11 13:02:03,iqq0i0,0,1,"Hi! 

(I am new to Reddit and I am still figuring out how it works so sorry if I say or do something wrong.)

&amp;#x200B;

Just a week ago I came out to my wife. I had been questioning myself about being non-binary for a while and I decided it was time to come out. 

I felt so happy to know that she accepts me and love me for who I am. And that she will help me become the person I want to be, the way I want to look and dress. 

However, now I find myself confused because I don't know where to start. There are so many things that I want to do and at the same time I feel overwhelmed by the changes. I suffer from OCD which makes it a bit harder to start without having a bunch of thoughts in my head. 

I am AMAB so the first thing I will change is my body hair because it drives me nuts! 

But I feel like I need more guidance in regards to clothing and so many more. 

That is why I am asking here today if someone wants to help me or guide me I would really appreciate it. 

Thank you!

AFAB. This is my first summer where I‚Äôve not shaved at all. I just wanted to talk about it and maybe get some thoughts from other NB people. I feel like my straight friends say shave it all and my gay friends say let it all go. 

It was really hard to get past the legs. As an AFAB people seem to think your dirty if you don‚Äôt shave legs. I got past this by going a little extra fem. Makeup dresses and heals with hair on my legs makes a statement I feel. People didn‚Äôt assume I was just frummpy or lazy but see it as a choice.

I know I want to shave my face. My face has small patchy bits of dark hair and I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs uneven. Plus I have a nice gentle, cheep tool so it‚Äôs ez. 

Shaving legs is a pain and as a swimmer the warmth is actually nice sometimes. I also like the idea that other queer people or kids might see me and know they have a choice in how they handle hair. That makes me happy. 

Pits, easy to shave and my skin does well, but not shaving is nice too. It gets a little longer than I like but only a little. I could go either way. 

Bikini area, shaving is way too hard and I‚Äôm not interested. I wanted to ask if anyone just trims and if so how?  I have a small pair of trim scissors but it‚Äôs kinda tiny. The results are my favorite though as trimming leaves it softer and a nice mid length.

2020-09-21 12:39:34,iwzm46,2,1,"TL;DR: A doubt-ridden vent.

When I first started questioning my gender and looked into trans stuff, I instantly figured I couldn't be trans because I didn't have the agonising dysphoria I saw described. I didn't think see myself as a guy trapped in a woman's body. I just thought of myself as me.

But the more I explored and thought about it the more I realised that me = not female.

Then there's the whole matter of what to do about it. To come out? To stay closeted? To transition medically? And it all felt so new to me, as if I was only just considering it now, whereas trans people I'd read about had considered it their whole lives. How much does my gender really matter to me? Surely, I thought, I'd probably be alright if I had to live in this role and form forever? And in many ways, I still think about that a lot, daily. It wouldn't kill me. 

I never sought to be androgynous. Not consciously. Nor does it seem ideal to me. I'd prefer either end to the middle, but I've already tried female. Whenever I doubt myself I feel like I must try it again, and I change my clothes and stare in the mirror or in old photos and each time I think - no, that's not me, who is that? I don't see myself represented as a woman, no matter how many women I look at.

I want to take testosterone. Or at least, I'd like the effects of it, I think. Or at least, I think if I go my life without trying it it will always nag at me, a what if. But it's no small deal. It cannot be 'just testosterone' in isolation. Even if I know that if it was sold cheap next to the paracetamol I'd have tried it a couple years ago already.

I'm not good at organising things. Especially big, serious, scary, ongoing long term things. And the longer I leave it the more I doubt. Am I unhappy, as I am? Don't I have a good life? Wouldn't I have organised it faster, if I was really trans/NB? I can't be a trans man, I don't share their experience, aren't I just a trespasser? Why can't I just be female, or failing that, can existing as I am just be enough?

And yet the longer it goes on and the more choices I face the more I choose the option that leads to 'not female, more male', every single time. I doubt. A lot. Am I making these choices to fill a narrative? To be neatly trans, when I know that I'm far from neat? Am I making these choices just to try and convince myself I'm a trans man, when I'm not? I don't fit in with either side, and I fit in with both at the same time. I hate it. I doubt. When I talk to men, I don't feel like one of them. When I talk to women, I don't feel like one of them. When I talk to NB people, I feel a mixture of comfort and discomfort and frustration, deep frustration with myself. A sense of: This isn't enough. But am I just being pointlessly competitive?

I didn't think see myself as a guy trapped in a woman's body. I just thought of myself as me.\n\nBut the more I explored and thought about it the more I realised that me = not female.\n\nThen there's the whole matter of what to do about it. To come out? To stay closeted? To transition medically? And it all felt so new to me, as if I was only just considering it now, whereas trans people I'd read about had considered it their whole lives. How much does my gender really matter to me? Surely, I thought, I'd probably be alright if I had to live in this role and form forever? And in many ways, I still think about that a lot, daily. It wouldn't kill me. \n\nI never sought to be androgynous. Not consciously. Nor does it seem ideal to me. I'd prefer either end to the middle, but I've already tried female. Whenever I doubt myself I feel like I must try it again, and I change my clothes and stare in the mirror or in old photos and each time I think - no, that's not me, who is that? I don't see myself represented as a woman, no matter how many women I look at.\n\nI want to take testosterone. Or at least, I'd like the effects of it, I think. Or at least, I think if I go my life without trying it it will always nag at me, a what if. But it's no small deal. It cannot be 'just testosterone' in isolation. Even if I know that if it was sold cheap next to the paracetamol I'd have tried it a couple years ago already.\n\nI'm not good at organising things. Especially big, serious, scary, ongoing long term things. And the longer I leave it the more I doubt. Am I unhappy, as I am? Don't I have a good life? Wouldn't I have organised it faster, if I was really trans/NB? I can't be a trans man, I don't share their experience, aren't I just a trespasser? Why can't I just be female, or failing that, can existing as I am just be enough?\n\nAnd yet the longer it goes on and the more choices I face the more I choose the option that leads to 'not female, more male', every single time. I doubt. A lot. Am I making these choices to fill a narrative? To be neatly trans, when I know that I'm far from neat? Am I making these choices just to try and convince myself I'm a trans man, when I'm not? I don't fit in with either side, and I fit in with both at the same time. I hate it. I doubt. When I talk to men, I don't feel like one of them. When I talk to women, I don't feel like one of them. When I talk to NB people, I feel a mixture of comfort and discomfort and frustration, deep frustration with myself. A sense of: This isn't enough. But am I just being pointlessly competitive?

IT'S A FUCKING PAIN! When I first moved I was hoping I'd be able to afford it by next November/December but it looks like it might not be until MAYBE next February/March. Plus the wait time for meeting a surgeon, getting approved, and waiting for the actual operation. 

I only have two shirts I can wear currently (without a coat on) that don't show my tits floppin' around like madlads without a bra on, which I don't own. 

I don't want to have to buy a binder, or sports bra. I shouldn't have to wear anything to cover my boobs! I want to be able to be the speedwalker I am without the feeling of tits. I want the comfortability of my chest being free with only a shirt on. (Or none at all, in the summer time.)

Tits are overrated anyways. I'm constantly hurting them when trying to be silly and playing with my children, or they're elbowing me right in the tits. My kids also like to grab my tits when they're falling to help them??? And owww?! That's not what they're for, you little shits! I don't even have big tits to begin with, but they're always getting in the way. 

I also already look very androgynous when I wear my more boyish outfit, and fantasize about having a beautiful tit-less chest with no nipples. I could pull off a masculine look even more! I'd be able to wear more men's shirts without my boob shape showing, or worse, my nipples. 

I hate nipples as well, they aren't big, but they're always ""out there"" and hanging out. Like, excuse me, can you not? I don't want people looking at you guys. I don't even get sexual feelings with my breasts. When guys have groped them it makes me feel so awkward, and I don't enjoy it. It's like someone it playing with a random part of your body, like your leg, I feel 0 pleasure. Might also be because I'm kind of asexual as well though..

I came out to my ex as NB and told him about my plans for top surgery since I would need his help with the kids when I'm recovering, and he totally shot me down as well. He's no concept of Non-binary and pretty much just said ""if you want to dress and act like a man, then *fine!*"" In a passive-aggressive tone, of course. And had the audacity to ask me that if we were still dating, and he didn't want me to go through with the surgery ""because he likes my breasts"" if I'd still go through with it. Ummmm, yeah? It's not about you, dude. I wasn't asking for your permission, I was telling you. He treats me like I'm trans, even though I'm Non-binary. I don't want to only dress like a dude. Of course some days I'm still going to wear my super cute floral summer dresses and cute floral button-up tops when I want, but I want to pass as a male too, when I want to. I'm BOTH!

So, I'm afab and I've had short hair my entire life. I tried growing it out a couple of times as a kid but would cut it short again pretty quickly. Short hair was just so much easier to manage, you know? And I could wash it less and no pesky combing it in the mornings. This was perfect for my lazy arse.

There's also a small part of me that felt that, being afab, I kinda had to have short hair? It just seems like the thing afab enbies do. Ya gotta have short hair to balance out the tiddy. Something like that. I am now figuring out that's dumb as hell and hair length doesn't dictate gender identity and I don't need to ""balance out"" anything. 

So, I've been growing out my hair. I don't want it super long but it's now shoulder length and that's perfect for me because I can tie it up into a nice little ponytail and, as a person who often likes presenting as masc, I think it actually looks kinda butch. All hail the ponytail!

After going to gender therapy, I realized that transitioning is right for me, both social and medical.

2020-09-23 17:20:02,iyeiau,8,1,"Hey everyone. I love this community and the people in it, and I was hoping I could get some love. 

I'm about to end a 5 year relationship with the man I've been in love with since high school. When I graduated I went to college in another state, back in 2017, and we were long distance until last July when we moved in together. I realized very suddenly that he was the same guy that I was dating in high school, and I absolutely am not. 

March 2019, I broke up with him. We took a month not talking but still split, and spoke again in April. I gave him a list of things I needed from him if I was willing to continue to be with him-- I was basically telling him to start taking initiative in his life and get his license. In our relationship, the dynamic is that I handle everything, and I needed him to start being my partner. Right now it feels like I have a teenage son. 

Since then, he hasn't risen to the occasion. He had 8 months to help save for the move to chicago, and made one giant poor financial decision, dropped $900 (all the moving fund) on an airbnb for when I was in town, and then COVID happened and he got laid off. He has no savings, and never told me he killed that money. When I found out, I started a joint fund so I could make sure there were funds. Most of it came from me. He also never learned to drive, and we're now driving here. He is 23. He's been working since 2016. 

While that all stresses me out, the worst is that I came out in 2017 when I moved to college as non-binary. For 2 years he still messed up my pronouns, and would get upset when I would tell him ""It's been 2 YEARS, you need to get this right"" and would be defensive. He still identifies as straight, and when I told him that bothered me, we had a conversation. I told him why it's an issue, and he seemed to understand. But when I told him to research some identities and what feels right, he didn't do any research. He just already knew what demisexual is, and picked that. (He's also not demisexual. I don't say this to invalidate him, but I know him and know that he just knew it.) So he still identifies as straight and shuts down when I try and talk to him about it.

Now, I've finally started T. It's been 2 months. We had talked about how my transition may be the end of the relationship. I believe it is time. The straw that broke the camel's back was when we had sex, and my bottom growth was coming in. I told him excitedly, ""did you notice? I have a little head growing!"" and he admitted that he was weirded out about it. At that moment I knew he could not support me in this. I do not feel validated. He talks about how much he loves my boobs, but they're a huge point of dysphoria for me. I don't feel like I can wear a binder around him, or my packer. He hasnt been mean, but he doesn't outright accept it. He is passively like ""oh cool"" but not in a supportive way, in a ""acknowledge it so it goes away"" way. He still calls me beautiful, when I've asked him not to use that language. He still treats me as a femme. As his girlfriend. And once my voice drops, my beard comes in, he's going to continue to distance. He loves me to pieces, and he is not cruel or intentionally ignorant. But it hurts. And it's devastating to come to this realization.

He's the kind of guy who takes 20 minutes to make a decision. I've been patient. I've put my feelings aside for him, over and over and over again to allow him his process. He doesn't support me the way I need it. I don't have the time to wait for him to get his head wrapped around my transition. I need support now. I need him now. And he has made himself inaccessible. And I'm too hurt to get over it this time. 

Please don't slam him. He's not a bad guy, and I still love him, and I'm not quite at a point where I need to or want to hear how much he's been a jerk. I want him to stay my friend, and be in my life. But I can't be with him romantically anymore. 

I want to go be adventurous. Try things. Go to bars (after COVID ofc). Move around, go live and meet people and try and be active. I have to fight him every day to give me attention. To go places. To eat new foods. He likes to sit and play videogames and talk to his online friends... even when we have plans, or Im in tears, he chooses them over me. He wants kids. I don't. I want to live in the world. He wants to stay inside. This really makes me want to cry... We had our first anniversary together in 3 years. I'd always been at school, so we could never do it on time. We didn't do anything that day, and when I asked him why in tears, he said it was because he didn't want to. 

We still have good times. We still laugh and hang out and talk... sometimes. I'm not a priority for him anymore, even though I work 60 hrs a week and still carve a day out for him. It makes me so sad. And now... I can't transition with him. I can't celebrate with him. I can't be myself around him.

2020-09-24 04:58:51,iyqtph,5,1,"Hi loves! I've got a doozy for ya.

Around the age of 15 I was thinking about the distant future and came to the conclusion that if humanity ever gets past climate change, racism, etc. and reaches a utopia-esque civilization that we‚Äôd inevitably move towards a genderless society. Or like - that the classification of men and women (I was stuck in the binary in highschool) would inevitably become irrelevant in a utopian timeline. This idea (hope?) stuck with me.

After I realized I was trans at age 22, I settled on using she and they pronouns partially because of this long-standing belief. I also came to the conclusion that nonbinary transfemme was the best descriptor for who I am. That idea I had at age 15 morphed as my understanding of gender grew. Part of it morphed into a desire to fundamentally restructure the english language to have one third person pronoun, they.

I'm 26 now, and since I hormonally and socially transitioned, I've had some doubts and have wondered if I might just be a binary woman. I've had some doubts about the idea. But it still holds some weight in me and it feels like a good indicator that I might be nonbinary. Not the only indicator, but still.

Here's where it gets tricky - recently a friend posted on facebook, the message being: We should reserve the word ‚Äúthey‚Äù for non-binary folx and not refer to people whose pronouns you don‚Äôt know by they (instead saying ""that person wearing red,"" or ""your friend,"" etc.). This led me to reconsider the idea and wonder if it was inherently flawed. While talking with my girlfriend about it, I realized that this idea of mine -might- be akin colorblindedness, but for gender (not that it would be the same, race and gender are very different, just trying to take learnings and see if they can be applied elsewhere!)

I\'ve got a doozy for ya.\n\nAround the age of 15 I was thinking about the distant future and came to the conclusion that if humanity ever gets past climate change, racism, etc. and reaches a utopia-esque civilization that we‚Äôd inevitably move towards a genderless society. Or like - that the classification of men and women (I was stuck in the binary in highschool) would inevitably become irrelevant in a utopian timeline. This idea (hope?) stuck with me.\n\nAfter I realized I was trans at age 22, I settled on using she and they pronouns partially because of this long-standing belief. I also came to the conclusion that nonbinary transfemme was the best descriptor for who I am. That idea I had at age 15 morphed as my understanding of gender grew. Part of it morphed into a desire to fundamentally restructure the english language to have one third person pronoun, they.\n\nI\'m 26 now, and since I hormonally and socially transitioned, I\'ve had some doubts and have wondered if I might just be a binary woman. I\'ve had some doubts about the idea. But it still holds some weight in me and it feels like a good indicator that I might be nonbinary. Not the only indicator, but still.\n\nHere\'s where it gets tricky - recently a friend posted on facebook, the message being: We should reserve the word ‚Äúthey‚Äù for non-binary folx and not refer to people whose pronouns you don‚Äôt know by they (instead saying ""that person wearing red,"" or ""your friend,"" etc.). This led me to reconsider the idea and wonder if it was inherently flawed. While talking with my girlfriend about it, I realized that this idea of mine -might- be akin colorblindedness, but for gender (not that it would be the same, race and gender are very different, just trying to take learnings and see if they can be applied elsewhere!)\n\nIf we were to shift our language only use they, we might be hindering discussion and understanding of very real issues that exist along lines of gender in our society.

The  story is you've signed up to be shipped off to help colonise a newly discovered planet, called Viridis Prime, where you play a farmer role. Grow alien plants and looks after alien animals all while flirting up a storm with the planet's other colonisers. 

Unlike many other farming sims, Verdant Skies doesn't have a typical character creator process. There is no ""pick your gender"" option. Instead you're told to pick clothes, skin colour, hairstyles, whether you have a flat chest or boobs ect and you can mix and match however you please. You can also change your look any time you want. Felling femme one day but masc the next? That's cool. You can change your character to reflect that. And throughout the game, your character is only referred to using they/them pronouns so, basically, your character is enby by default. 

There is actually one other nonbinary character in game besides yourself and that is Zaheen Patel the colony's doctor. Zaheen uses they/them pronouns and is one of the characters you can pursue romantically. There are a total of twelve characters you can date. Five guys, one enby and six girls. I do wish they would have had more enby characters to romance and interact with. At least maybe make it two so the gender ratios are more even. You know, have five guys, two enbies and five girls. But having any nonbinary romance options is pretty rare so I'm not complaining that much because them having even one is a pretty big deal. 

To finish off my post, here is a picture of our lovely Zaheen along with their character bio.

I'm not 100% if this is the right place for my post, but I tought this would be okay.

Hi, I'm (18) currently questioning my gender a lot and honestly don't know what to think of myself. This has been going on for quite a while now, and I think I could use a second opinion, as I'm not comfortable talking about this irl.

I don't feel like I'm the opposite gender but I'm also not sure if I'm fully the gender my body is. I was born into a woman's body but have always had an issue with my genitals. I've, almost my whole life, wished I had a dick instead of a vagina and in recent years, I've really started to dislike my boobs. However, I do not want to be a man.

The thing that also adds to my stress concerning my body is the fact that I'm a bit on the bigger side and, in general, am not comfortable in my body. I'm not sure if I actually dislike my body because it's just not me, or if it's just because of my body dysmorphia (is that the right term?).

My mother tongue doesn't have gendered words and the words used for he/she are also gender neutral, so I haven't really had a problem with my pronouns.

I guess it's also worth mentioning that I don't mind identifying as a woman. I am more okay with identifying as a woman than a man, but still, both seem a little off.

I've googled my concerns many times but just can't seem to make sense of my situation, so please help me if possible.

This has been going on for quite a while now, and I think I could use a second opinion, as I'm not comfortable talking about this irl.\n\nI don't feel like I'm the opposite gender but I'm also not sure if I'm fully the gender my body is. I was born into a woman's body but have always had an issue with my genitals. I've, almost my whole life, wished I had a dick instead of a vagina and in recent years, I've really started to dislike my boobs. However, I do not want to be a man.\n\nThe thing that also adds to my stress concerning my body is the fact that I'm a bit on the bigger side and, in general, am not comfortable in my body. I'm not sure if I actually dislike my body because it's just not me, or if it's just because of my body dysmorphia (is that the right term?).\n\nMy mother tongue doesn't have gendered words and the words used for he/she are also gender neutral, so I haven't really had a problem with my pronouns.\n\nI guess it's also worth mentioning that I don't mind identifying as a woman. I am more okay with identifying as a woman than a man, but still, both seem a little off.\n\nI've googled my concerns many times but just can't seem to make sense of my situation, so please help me if possible.\n\nSorry if this is messy.

2020-09-29 21:43:30,j28xa5,3,1,"It occurred to me when discussing gender with my transgender partner I may be non-binary. I am having issues differentiating between just my views on life and whether it is to do with my gender identity of that makes sense?

For example I feel like gender shouldn't matter as it should and I couldn't care less about the body I am in or being male or female.

I have a variety of feminine and masculine hobbies but that whole concept is stupid to me and don't think it should matter.

I do dislike extremely feminine and extremely masculine environments and find to not fit into groups like that.

I am one hundred perfect comfortable with my body I am born female and don't mind the pronouns she/her. I am asexual and panromantic if that has any relevance.

My partner commented that I prefer to go by Rach and like to be fairly in the middle. But I can't tell if that's just me having a casual feel to myself. She said of course that won't define me.

I felt like I haven't really fit in with either gender but at the same time I feel hobbies etc shouldn't define what you identify with.

However, it irks me when they gripe about being corrected when they misgender someone or make little excuses for it.

For example, I was watching a YT call-in show on our livingroom tv. One of the hosts is nonbinary. My mom walks in and made a comment about the topic and ended up misgendering the host multiple times. I calmly stated that the host is nonbinary and they dont use those pronouns. I think she took it a bit personally because she kept on saying stuff like ""oh  they look and sound really feminine and that's why I keep misgendering them"" and then she still ended up misgendering the person after that. 

I think that I took that kinda personally, because I feel like my mom didnt take being nonbinary seriously. I get that it's a host on tv, but I feel like if I'm nonbinary, she wouldnt take me seriously either. Also, no  nonbinary person owes you androgyny.
