2020-03-02 00:22:18,fc3gun,7,1,"Ok maybe the title isn’t 100% accurate, because I think I’m done questioning, but I’m not sure what happens next.

I’m an AMAB person who is not comfortable being a man, but I’ve also got some spicy impostor syndrome type shit that comes up every time I consider outing myself.

My big issue: I’ve got some wonderful nonbinary friends who use they/he pronouns. Unlike them I’m AMAB and masc-presenting (working on changing that), and I feel like I’m not real enough to use they/them pronouns.

I don’t think my childhood and adolescence lines up with stories about always feeling out of place/in the wrong body/like something other than your agab. I’ve never been very masculine or interested in competitive masculine shit, but I’ve never wanted to become a woman, or be seen as a woman. Maybe three years ago I started seriously thinking about gender, and slowly realized I would be much happier if I wasn’t a man. Partly because I didn’t feel like one, and partly because I didn’t want to be seen as one. 

For a while, I imagined this was normal. Like, cool, just chilling out, having regular cis thoughts about how I hate being a man, how normal, all of the other cis people must also hate being cis, this is normal.

Things got a bit more complicated when I started seriously considering presenting as something other than masculine &amp; had a little weird emotional moment, and then ~other~ similar emotional moments (panicking when I considered that, unless I come out to parents and friends, I might miss the window and be a man for the rest of my life — no, it doesn’t really make sense, but it’s something I’ve honestly worried about) that made me pretty sure I wasn’t cis.

So anyways, at this point, I’m pretty sure cis folks don’t lose it when they imagine not being cis. That makes me wonder whether I’m (gasp) not cis?

Cue the last nine-ish months of my life, in which I have discovered:

1. That I consistently hate being a man

2. That my family is not going to enjoy this information

3. That my friends are cool and supportive and I think they’ll probably support me when I’m out

4. That I still feel super insecure in whether I’m an authentic nonbinary person, probably because I read the gender theory before I started to think about myself, and now I’ve convinced myself that I’m just cis with extra confusion or something

5. That idrk how to out myself like at all

2020-03-03 05:21:27,fcpt9l,7,1,"I don't know how to feel. This is something that has been on my mind a lot. Like a lot, a lot. I guess up to this point I'd just convinced myself I'm a really invested cis ally to the trans community. I'm in several online trans groups as a lurker and spend a lot of time interested in trans discourse and topics. I've repeatedly told myself I'm just a dedicated trans ally who just likes to read up on stuff.

Backstory stuff:

Id say it started when I was around high school (2012ish) when I first learned what transgender even was. I repeatedly watched trans YouTubers like UppercaseChase, Brandon Sorenson, TheSLOFox and various others.

I thought to myself maybe I was trans and so I'd buy ace bandages (bad I know I know) and push my hair back into a hat to see what I'd look like. It gave me a small rush to see myself. But the issue was I don't think I have dysphoria. Back then I didn't see anyone talk about gender euphoria, only dysphoria. I'm fine with my feminine body, I think I look good. I like my curves and my hips. When it comes to my breasts I'm pretty ambivalent about them, I don't really dislike them, I like to squish them but looks-wise I could care less if they were on my body but I never felt dysphoric about them. I would get haircuts as short as my parents would allow (between my chin and shoulders) but I'd always dream about having my hair cut shorter ""like a boy"".

I had come across blog posts describing non binary identities and I tried coming out to a friend as bigender/genderfluid pretty rashly. They seemed uncomfortable and never really brought it up after that and neither did I even though I thought about it. I also went by the name ""Brandon"" online occasionally but overall I kind of didn't talk to anyone about how much I thought about gender even though I was the president of my schools gay-straight alliance with teachers who probably could have given me guidance. Without dysphoria, I felt like a fraud. After that is where the denial started.

I told myself I wasn't trans after that and stuck to my story. I created a second Facebook profile where I presented as male. I cut my hair short and bought a binder but never wore it in public. I just told myself I enjoyed crossdressing, nothing more. A few times I've been mistaken for a boy and I've always felt a small thrill. To most people irl I complain about having a deep voice for a woman but secretly I love it. I have thicker body hair and some facial hair that I get self conscious about when other people notice but I kind of enjoy having myself.

Now this is the part I'm kind of afraid will turn some people away and am not the proudest of.

When I first learned about being trans without dysphoria in a FB comment section, I remember feeling viscerally angry. I couldn't believe that people were calling themselves trans when they didn't have dysphoria when I didn't dare do so without it. I argued with the person on the thread and told them that they were absolutely wrong. This was on my male presenting FB profile. I suppose a trans person saw my comments and assumed I was trans and so they shot me a link to a FB group. It was a truscum group. I joined the group.

It was a strange experience. People in the group just assumed I was trans in the group and I never corrected them. I stayed around and actually contributed to the discourse quite a lot. Id share trans related memes and discussions and complained about the ""tucutes"". But in my head i again just rationalized it as I'm just a crossdressing ally who was really invested. I just didn't want cis people coming in and taking the trans label from people who actually suffered from dysphoria. This also gave me further excuse to be in denial, it further led me to believe I was just a crossdresser. Nothing more than that because I didn't have dysphoria even though I enjoyed people referring to me by my online alias and pronouns.

And then I started watching ContraPoints and her video ""Transtrenders"" really stuck with me. Not enough to really pull me out but it made me think a lot about what transness is. I still didn't ""buy"" it but I started to get skeptical of transmed rhetoric.

More and more time has passed and I'm really at the point where I don't know what to believe. I definitely don't feel as if I'm fully a woman. I know I'm comfortable and even enjoy being viewed as masculine. I just don't feel like there's any way for me to ever feel fully valid as nonbinary without some form of concrete evidence or basis for this identity. I really don't want to seem rude or dismissive but a lot of nonbinary identities seem arbitrary and not very concrete or specific at all. And I guess I still feel that subconscious ""SJW-hating"" truscum rhetoric in my ear telling me I'm being dumb and that I shouldn't question or change anything but I'm really confused and unsure how to feel.

TL;DR
I questioned if I was trans in high school and have gone through hard denial of any sort of trans identity since then.

2020-03-09 00:03:05,fflr13,4,1,"Hello everyone. I am looking for some advice. I was assumed female at birth but was always a tomboy. I have been questioning my gender identity for a long time now - I remember feeling utterly dumbfounded at Judy Blume's books when she described girls wanting their breasts to grow; I remember binding my chest with a tensor bandage when I hit puberty; and I remember the utter devastation when my period started.  

However, I never had the right language. I was in residential treatment for an eating disorder and remember being asked, ""Are you sure you are a girl?"" I scoffed at the professionals and said ""of course I am."" Meanwhile, this question caused me a lot of internal stress. I eventually dismissed it because I thought the only other option was a boy, and I knew that that didn't fit for me. But being a girl didn't fit either and I spent many years after that feeling out of place. For example, I work in a female dominated profession where we always refer to groups of ourselves as ""ladies"" - this makes me feel alienated. I try to blend in my copying clothing styles, but I just feel uncomfortable.


It has only been recently, since I started working with youth under the Trans umbrella and attending conferences and trainings, that I have learned more about myself - and the implications terrify me.

At the end of the day, I don't want to create any waves, I hate being noticed.

I came out to my career mentor last week. I am out as nonbinary to all my friends, and I want to be out at work. I can't stand to be referred to as ""she"" or a lady or a woman any longer, especially when I present as masc as possible and pass as a guy outside work, so it was time for a change. My mentor is currently also my boss in a temporary position, but more importantly, we work in the same very small field and I want her to know the real me going forward because I'll probably know her forever. 

I was so nervous going into her office. We chatted about other stuff, my upcoming move and how the lab was going, and when it was time to say what I came there to say, my heart was pounding so hard it was all I could perceive. But I said it, and the first thing out of her mouth was ""Oh good, I wanted to know your pronouns but I wasn't sure how to ask."" 

From there we had a conversation about my experiences in the past and expectations going forward to my next job at a different university. I left feeling warm and uplifted. Afterwards she sent me an incredibly lovely email that I will treasure forever, saying how proud she was of me. She added her pronouns to her email signature. Some people are so wonderful to know.

I sent an email a couple days later to my contact in my new department at the university I'm moving to. When I interviewed there I was presenting as a woman and now need to let everyone know that I'm not a woman, and my pronouns are they/them, and I'm changing my name, and also which changing rooms can I use. It's painful and awkward and makes me anxious if I think about it too much. But I'm still glad I'm doing it. I can't be anything other than who I really am.

First, a little about me. I am 25 years old, I live in the EU, and I was AFAB. However, I would describe myself as a woman (maybe female presenting is a better term?) and use she/her pronouns. Despite this, I have very feminine days and very masculine days. It depends on how I’m feeling in the morning. 

 For my whole life, I have been heavily floating between femininity and masculinity, and after some thorough research and a mind-blowing realization, I have come to the conclusion that I am non-binary....or at least I was until I read so many different definitions of what it means to be non-binary/genderqueer. So I’ve got some questions:

1) What does it mean to you to be non-binary? ( I have read so many different definitions of what it means to be non-binary/genderqueer. As soon as I read one definition and I’m like, “Hell yeah, this is me,” I read another one and go, “Hmmm but that doesn’t quite describe my feelings...” I prefer things to be very straightforward and defined, but this is way more dense than that.)

2) Have you ever worried that if you came out to your friends as non-binary/genderqueer, they would view it as a gimmick or say that, “It’s not real”? (The few friends my introverted self has managed to scrape up are extremely supportive and loving, but I still worry about what they will think.)

3) Attention Non-Binary/Genderqueer People Like Me (i.e. AFAB, female presenting): Have you had issues with people perceiving your non-binary/genderqueer identity as “not as valid” on days when you choose to present as female/femme?

so i was still questioning, presented as NB online but never took it seriously, but as it started to progress i came out to a close friend as NB when i was 14. i was accepted and nothing bad happened, BUT... 

I started to feel like I’m just not NB later, so i got over myself. until last summer, i ID-d as a trans guy for around a year? eventually, i felt like i was either faking or i’m just a cis girl trying to be special, because being a man didn’t feel right either, i wanted to go back to being NB and using they/them, but that felt bad too, but using he/him didn’t feel right either, i kind of wanted a combination of the two, like to have both sets at the same time... 

so, instead of figuring it out, i swept it all under the rug last summer and kept it there as best as i could. in the summer i started dating the most amazing person ever, who is bi-curious, and since then I expressed it to him that i might be trans.. he said he wouldn’t mind, he would still love me the same, but trying again at this gender thing... i guess i’m just *too lazy to be trans*??

right now i’m still questioning, i mean, i would LOVE to be a boy but being a boy would make me enjoy being more feminine because i’d still be a boy no matter if i wore pink hoodies or thigh-highs, but that means that since i’d enjoy those things i definitely am female, but i cringe every time someone refers to me as “she”, imagining my life as a woman sends me into a panic attack and when my bf and me tried using male pronouns for me i was ecstatic...

I am a fourth year Geography Honours student studying at the University of St Andrews. I am writing my dissertation on the ways in which people communicate in online spaces and how online community spaces help to empower and support non-binary individuals. I will also be looking at how gender is expressed and constructed in these spaces and how experiences within these groups influences the ways in which people express themselves and feel in the offline world. To do this I am conducting a series of online interviews over messenger services.

If you are 18 years old or over and interested in participating, please contact me through private message or by sending me an email to receive further information on the study.

2020-03-17 05:04:11,fjziyj,5,1,"Hello! I'm Isaac and 2 years ago, after a long time of piecing things together, it clicked in my brain that I'm non-binary (he/they). It was 4 years after I realized I was gay so it wasn't something that I had a hard time accepting 

At first I didn't really care about people using my birth name (named myself isaac) or using she/her pronouns.

But over time, especially since last year, it really started to bother me hearing my birth name and whenever people referred to me as a woman I really started noticing and focusing on those words specifically, not just pronouns but female gendered words since in Portuguese that's very very common so I hear it a LOT throughout the day if I'm around other people.

It just keeps getting worse? It makes me feel really bad and anxious. When people use female coded words it just gives me a little thud of pain in my chest and I really hate it.

I have a binder and it makes me feel great when I wear it and I'm more confident but whenever I see my body in the mirror without it I feel way more uncomfortable, it has become more than just regular insecurities and I hate seeing it on some days, it sucks.

 I cant wear my binder very often since wearing many days in a row hurts my back so i have to take a few breaks from binding during the week which makes me highly aware of my chest during the day even if I'm wearing baggy clothes.

Now,, I've told a few close irl friends that I didnt identify in the binary and they thought I was joking or making it up so they didnt take it seriously? So I haven't brought it up since and I'm nervous about saying I want them to call me Isaac before my head explodes so I might just not? 

It's my first time not being bullied at school and people actually like me despite knowing I'm gay so I don't want to ruin my last 2 years of school by telling someone and have someone else overhear it or have it go wrong and the person telling me I'm kidding again or that it's weird. I dont know.

Something I'm insecure about doing is wearing makeup and skirts? Not because it makes me uncomfortable, I feel good when I wear skirts and lipstick but I also feel more masculine than feminine inside? And I'm happiest when I combine the skirts and my binder... But - although I dont believe in clothes being gendered and that anyone can wear whatever they want despite their gender or whether they're cis or not - I feel like I won't be taken seriously? I present in a more feminine way at times but I never FEEL feminine, I just wear female coded clothes and other times I present more masculine and either way I feel the same, I feel like me.

The thing is, that if I saw someone else do this, I would just tell them it's fine and that it doesnt matter how they present to others because it's not other people's business, and I do believe that, but when it comes to ME being in this position I just feel insecure about coming out to IRLs as non-binary because 1. I'd have to explain it and that makes me lose any kind of confidence right off the bat and 2. Because I feel like they would expect me to dress androgynously

Have any of you progressively been bothered by your pronouns or appearance when you were okay with it at the start? I feel alone and like I'm going crazy or something, I'm not comfortable with any gnc people to privately talk about this and just need to know if this is a regular occurrence

I will be analyzing online conversational discourse to see how it helps construct gender identity. Right now I especially need participants who are AMAB and identify as non-binary if you can please participate. 

You will just need to have a short conversation with me over reddit or something on any topic(s). Alternatively, if you don’t feel like talking with me, just email me screenshots of a conversation you had with literally anyone on any topic, as long as it is sufficiently long and is an actual conversation not just back and forth responses to questions. Ideally around 40+ messages on your part of the conversation. I would really prefer you talk to me though. 

I will definitely not let your name or anything be known (participants will be designated by pseudonyms, you may specify what you would like your pseudonym to be so that it can match your identity!) and any conversation I use will be deleted once I record the data. 

The institution is West Virginia University and the sponsoring professor is Sergio Robles Puente; his email is seroblespuente@mix.wvu.edu. Below is the prompt for the informed consent form, just copy it and type your name and then copy that and send it to me. 

I will treat you with respect and dignity and that one reason the study is being done is because there is not enough research on the relationship between discourse and identity in the LGBTQ+ community and I would like to add to the literature in that regards, as linguistics has primarily focused on cis straight people. 

Thank you for reading, and I would love for you to participate in this study. 

Much love ❤️

When I was younger, maybe 12 or 13, I liked to try on my mum's tights and pretend that I was a girl. I stopped doing this pretty quickly because I was so afraid of being caught. Once when I was on holiday with my family for Christmas a couple years ago, there was some female underwear and a pyjama dress kind of thing that was left in the toilet. For some reason, I decided to try these on. It felt sort of right, but still not quite, so I forgot about it and carried on life as male. When I was 16, I discovered I had a massive crush on my (male) best friend, which brought into question my sexuality. I knew there were quite obvious signs from earlier in life that I probably wasn't straight, so I thought I was probably bisexual, and left it there. I was super comfortable and happy being bi until perhaps 6 months ago. At that point, I realised that I wasn't really sexually attracted to guys (tho I can still appreciate a fit guy). But in my relationships with my closest male friends, I feel a level of affection for them that I don't see any other guys showing. It feels almost as if I love them as siblings. Just to be clear, there is no sexual attraction whatsoever here. I decided that I was probably just straight and used to be a bit confused, but now I think there might be something else going on. I remember, years and years ago maybe when I was like 8 or 9, I had thoughts like: I was born a girl and my parents turned me into a boy; or just flat out I think I should be a girl. I used to like wearing necklaces and bracelets, but I stopped wearing them at around age 10. I still like wearing bracelets, I feel sort of safe in a way when I've got something on my wrist, but I rarely wear them out of fear. I don't know what I'm scared of, probably social rejection (I'm a pretty awkward guy around new people). However, even after saying all that, I'm still a guy. I don't want to change my name and I'm happy being referred to with male pronouns and being called a brother. I thought perhaps I was a trans woman, but that doesn't really feel right: I'm not a woman. Hence I think perhaps non-binary is the best label there is for me. I cba to research and find some specific label that fits me perfectly, my name does that. This whole gender thing is pretty new to me. I don't really know how I'm feeling and whether I'm happy being non-binary. However, when I imagine getting piercings and wearing bracelets and painting my nails, it kinda feels natural. The only thing keeping everything a bit up in the air is the fact that I'm happy as a guy, as far as I can currently tell.

Apologies for the probable lack of flow in that massive paragraph, I didn't plan anything and it's pretty much just my stream of consciousness vomited onto the screen.

2020-03-26 14:51:27,fpcsig,2,1,"I know, the title is most likely confusing. So, I'm Non-binary, use they/them, and have been out (to select people) since I was maybe 10yrs-11yrs old. I've known this girl since 7th Grade and we hit it off instantly. It wasn't in a very normal way, either. I personally don't get very close to people, and she's not the kind of person to welcome people trying to get close out of nowhere, so considering how easily we adjusted to one another was crazy. Plus we're both rather spiritual (me being a Pagan Witch-in-training and craft practicer, her being a Christian churchgoer) and believe in the idea of twin flames and soulmates, so considering our bond we were both easily ready to accept something like that was the case. What I'm getting at is we were/are very close. Now, up until recently she's been very open to me, and a while back she revealed she used to be strongly homophobic and that's the reason a lot of her older friends got pushed away. While I was surprised considering nowadays she's pretty much the only cishet in our mutual friend group, I was glad she told me cause it seemed she had changed and grown as a person to be more open. I was semi-wrong, both on my end and hers. Up until now, she's called me by my pronouns and name and called other trans people we know (even though most of them we don't like for other reasons I won't get into) their names and pronouns to the best of her ability. We got onto the topic of one of these people via insta chat where we usually talk, and I started feeling like everything was sorta off. She felt frustrated and like she was trying to hide it behind the screen, but I didn't point it out until it started affecting what she was saying about this kid. She misgendered this person a few times and seemed on edge, and that faded into a full paragraph of full deadnaming and misgendering while ranting about him. I remember saying something of a correction, like making sure it was obvious I wanted her to use 'he' by putting it in caps, and told her something like ""even if we hate HIM *carry on conversation*"", to which she said ""I won't call *deadname* a he because she isn't"". I got confused, told her that was oddly transphobic, and asked if she could tell me why not, to which she sent me a fairly defensive message going over how she didn't believe it was right and how she was sorry but she wasn't ""going to roll with everything all the time"" end quote. I was obviously a little surprised, and tbh could have responded better, but I pretty much just went ""oh"" and left it at that with no other response. A few hours later around 11PM she sent me a message that said ""I'm sorry"", and again I could have responded better but all I said was ""don't be"". A few days go by and she starts talking to me again like she normally did, but notices that this time *my* tone feels off (I hadn't noticed much), so she asks if I'm mad. I don't want to lie to her because honestly I wasn't, so I tell her no, and she tells me she doesn't know what she wants from me and to be open and direct. So I am. I really wasn't angry at her, we were so close that I didn't think I could ever be angry with her, but I was really hurt, and what was worse is I sort of expected her to reveal that. Ever since she told me she used to be awful about LGBTQ support, I tried to play my worries off as my anxiety or pessimism, but I was right this time cause I'd been worried that she hadn't actually changed this entire time. And we get into a deep conversation about what support actually is, why it hurt me, and what changes I want to see in her. I tell her that I wanna go back to how we were cause neither of us want to lose the other, but that there might be a block in the way now on my end cause I didn't think I could just go back knowing this. She surprisingly reacted well, asked me genuine questions, and told me she was ready to change and learn. This came as a shock to me, and don't get me wrong, I was ecstatic she was willing to learn and not growing defensive when I picked apart what she was saying, but part of me felt sort of guilty? I still felt like she wasn't being genuine and like the time would come for another outbreak, and I felt bad because I don't like seeing the worst in everything all the time, but considering I'm 9/10 times right on these hunches and the last one I had with her proved true I couldn't help but be skeptical. Plus I've personally been trying to change for other reasons, too, and this was a good time to do it and grow from this awkward monent, but I felt bad about changing because I didn't want her to feel like it was her fault I suddenly did a 180 in personality. So I fell back into talking to her normally and rarely bringing these issues up. It's been a few weeks and she's treating it like it's back to normal, I'm acting like I usually do around her, etc, etc. But I know that I've pulled back a bit. She hasn't seemed to notice, and if she has hasn't said it, but I don't know if I can give her much trust again.

How do I bounce back if she said she wanted to change but I'm too scared to even help like I said I would? I'm scared that if I push towards improvement, it'll be worse off for her and us, but I know if I don't nothing will happen cause she doesn't know where to start education wise and considering the trans people we know I'd rather her get help from me than them (that isn't an attack at their identities, it's an attack at them, because they suck as people). How do I let the block down to help her and get close to her again without the closeness being non-genuine on my end (say that five times fast)?

I have some questions, all. Background info: I'm a 34 year old bisexual cis female, currently in a monogamous relationship with a straight cis man. I also identity as demisexual, and only just realized I was bi a couple years ago. I always felt like I was different, and I thought that identifying my sexuality would be the end to that, but I still feel like something is missing.

Recently, the idea of being non binary has become very interesting to me.

One of my biggest questions is this: how do you know if you truly are non binary, or if you are just a ""masculine female"" or ""feminine male"" or somewhere in between. I am also having a hard time figuring out if my interests are just a part of my personality or if it has a deeper meaning. Where is the line between personality traits and gender identity?

I very much subscribe to the idea that gender is fluid and people should be able to identify and express themselves however they feel fit.

2020-03-27 09:43:14,fpu5b7,9,1,"Hi all! In the life of Quarantine, I've had a lot of time to ponder and reflect, and I was looking for some shared experiences, brains, and answers to some questions, starting with the few that constantly plague me.  The big ones:
1. Do I change my name?
2. How far do I take it? 
3. Will I ever get past the feelings of feeling fake? 

A bit of background, I'm a 21yo AFAB genderfluid individual who came out at 13, it didn't really work out, so I came out again at 18 more successfully. I've kept the same name and the same partner through my transition. I tend to prefer to present masculinem but I typically end up presenting feminine because of genetics and Tig Bitties™. I'm appreciative to any thoughts that y'all have. 

1. I know this is a highly personal question, but it's one of those things I think about a lot. If I change my name, will I feel better? Will I feel worse? Will it trigger my anxiety so badly because now, not only am I asking people to remember they/them pronouns, but also a new name? Will my parents and friends be offended? Plus I already have a cool birth name, why change it? 

So I guess my question here is, what have y'alls experiences been with changing your name? What did it do for you? What did you learn?  Thoughts, feelings, experiences?

2. This is in reference to my presentation. Im AFAB and I know the idea of ""socializing"" is touchy, but I feel like it was really shoved down my throat to embody female norms. I came out non binary at 13 and my brother (who I was close with at the time, we no longer talk) basically disowned me, and my parents were very aggressive about not hearing that. My dad in particular-- ""you are my DAUGHTER"" and whatnot, my mom quietly just ignored it. They refused to buy me anything but girls' clothes, and when I stopped shaving it was things like ""we'll only buy you skirts if you shave your legs"" and mocking me for armpit hair. When I was a kid, I cut my hair short as soon as I knew I could, and I would only hang out with the boys and dress more masculinely. I was also a very gay child and had crushes on all of my female friends. Now I'm engaged to a cishet male, he's wonderful and healthy and I adore him. But he's also straight. And he's said to me before that he doesn't know, if I went full transition, beard and all, that he would be able to continue to be attracted to me. 
This isn't out of hate, this isn't transphobic-- the dude is just straight, and I get that. He's always been supremely supportive, and I've kept from fully exploring because of that (and college). But among everything, I still wonder. 
I want breast reduction, but do I take it all the way? I'm a 40F now and it fucking sucks lol. I'm also a bit chubby, so I'm super curvy and not an androgynous body type at all. 

So my question there is, for those who have smaller breasts, how does that affect your presentation? What about binding? Did you have to get over aggressive norms? How did you do it? What tips and tricks, self talk did you do? 

I know I don't want to go on T, but I think about it sometimes. 

Has anyone worn lacefront beards? Are they worth it? 

3. I guess, because I typically present female because for me, and my body type, voice, etc. it's easier, but I feel like a fraud. When I wear a skirt or a dress or woman's clothing, I feel like a fraud to call myself nonbinary. I always felt growing up that when I wore women's clothes I was in drag. And I feel like that isn't always true now, but it still feels like I would rather have a masculine body that I dress to present more femininely, rather than a feminine body I dress up or present masculinely. That seems really stupid, to look masculine to then look feminine, but I hope that makes sense? It just feels like this constant war going on inside, and I don't know what I need to pull to relieve the pressure. I'm worried about disappointing people I know. I'm terrified of making a change and realizing it's wrong and having to admit that to people. 

Doea anyone have any other experiences like that? How do you fight off feelings of fraud? What if I come out as one thing, and it's wrong?

2020-03-27 22:23:46,fq7a7q,8,1,"Warning: This posts contains a lot of personal stuff so if you don't like hearing about that kind of thing I would suggest you not read it.

So I'm not sure if I have gender dysphoria or not. I'm a high school student who was born male. I grew and up and still live in a small rural county, and therefore had very little exposure to anything besides male or female. Recently I have been doing more research about alternative genders, and believe I may have gender dysphoria. Based on what I have read it seems most studies and criteria focus exclusively on people who feel completely like the opposite gender and are transgender. However, I don't feel like a girl, I'm just not sure If I am a boy either. I have 2 questions. Firstly, do nonbinary people have gender dysphoria? If so, based on the way I feel do I have gender dysphoria?

Reasons I think I do have it:

I hate body hair of all kinds, I have always had trouble using urinals and felt incredibly uncomfortable doing so. I wore a long hoodie for almost the entirety of 7th and 8th grade because I didn't like that you could see my genitalia through my pants. I have spent a lot of time thinking about different names and pronouns, and have seriously considered HRT. I hate how skinny my legs are, and wish I had a more curvy, feminine shape. I have often wished I could use makeup, jewelry and dress in more feminine/androgynous clothing, and have began implementing such things into my life. And finally, I have often felt really sad/anxious when people have called me handsome, young man or various other masculine things.

Reasons I Think I don't have it:

I do not have any real desire to have breasts or breast tissue. I don't really have a problem with my genitalia, just the hair that goes with it. These feelings didn't really start taking root until I was 14-15 years old (Is that normal?). I like men and identify as gay currently, and sometimes question wether my desire to be more feminine/androgynous is somehow linked to that.

2020-03-28 14:02:22,fqkq1n,16,1,"Is it okay that I kind of just... came to the conclusion that I'm non-binary?

I've been thinking about how much I've hated my body lately. I was born a woman, female. And for most my life, I've hated how I look. I've hated being forced into the woman role (thanks, Mormon family), and most my life, I've been doing my best to avoid the look, trying my best to dodge appearing too ""feminine"", like the color pink, girly dolls, girly clothes... 

I wanted to be like my brothers, look like my brothers, have clothes and toys like my brothers, wishing my grandpa would invite me to go fishing (surprise surprise, he didn't...), go to the shooting range, have my own gun (again, surprise, didn't get one and my brothers did). 

My hips widened, my chest developed, my thighs grew, and I hated all of it. I chopped my hair (never again, I didn't look too great). 

*Now to the good stuff*. Yesterday, I thought to myself, ""who said you couldn't be non-binary?"" (My body looks like it could just pop babies like np, smh...) And, who said I had to identify as female? Who says I can't be happy as I am? Who says who I can and can't be? Who says I have to stay in a state of anger, pain, and envy because I can't magically shrink my hips and chest? Most importantly, who ever said that non binary isn't an option for me, that I had to choose woman or man?

**It's just like magic**. I don't hate myself. I don't feel so much pain. I feel comfortable with my gender identity. For once, I don't have to be on one side or the other. I can be... me. Just me. And, it's so fucking beautiful. Like I've only been seeing in black and white and now see life in color. A world full of options, a world of room to discover myself, and even, someday, *love myself*. 

*I know this all may sound overly dramatic*, but for as long as I've hated myself, with all I've been through, all the self hatred and loathing, all the agony and pain I've been through (or felt I deserved)... this has been the brightest ray of hope I've experienced in a while. 

I'm happy I finally feel more comfortable with myself. Grateful there's a safe space for me to express myself. And I hope someday I'm brave enough to share this awesome news with others. I don't feel so alone.

I\'ve hated being forced into the woman role (thanks, Mormon family), and most my life, I\'ve been doing my best to avoid the look, trying my best to dodge appearing too ""feminine"", like the color pink, girly dolls, girly clothes... \n\nI wanted to be like my brothers, look like my brothers, have clothes and toys like my brothers, wishing my grandpa would invite me to go fishing (surprise surprise, he didn\'t...), go to the shooting range, have my own gun (again, surprise, didn\'t get one and my brothers did). \n\nMy hips widened, my chest developed, my thighs grew, and I hated all of it. I chopped my hair (never again, I didn\'t look too great). \n\n*Now to the good stuff*. Yesterday, I thought to myself, ""who said you couldn\'t be non-binary?"" (My body looks like it could just pop babies like np, smh...) And, who said I had to identify as female? Who says I can\'t be happy as I am? Who says who I can and can\'t be? Who says I have to stay in a state of anger, pain, and envy because I can\'t magically shrink my hips and chest? Most importantly, who ever said that non binary isn\'t an option for me, that I had to choose woman or man?\n\n**It\'s just like magic**. I don\'t hate myself. I don\'t feel so much pain. I feel comfortable with my gender identity. For once, I don\'t have to be on one side or the other. I can be... me. Just me. And, it\'s so fucking beautiful. Like I\'ve only been seeing in black and white and now see life in color. A world full of options, a world of room to discover myself, and even, someday, *love myself*. \n\n*I know this all may sound overly dramatic*, but for as long as I\'ve hated myself, with all I\'ve been through, all the self hatred and loathing, all the agony and pain I\'ve been through (or felt I deserved)... this has been the brightest ray of hope I\'ve experienced in a while. \n\nI\'m happy I finally feel more comfortable with myself.

I understand this account is brand new and may be untrustworthy for that reason, but I made this account so I could talk freely about my feelings about my gender/sexuality.

Hey, all. I made this account specifically because I feel like maybe I’m non-binary, and maybe gay? I’ve never mentioned this to a single person I know because I’m too scared, nervous, shy, and uncertain.

As of right now, I’m a cishet man. Over the past couple years, I’ve learned a bit about trans people, non-binary people, and gender as a spectrum.

Since I was quite young, about 10 or so, I’ve had significantly long hair (like down past my pectorals long hair). I’ve always liked having long hair, though it hasn’t been quite as long since (I’m now 22, and my hair is roughly to my shoulders). But even from that point, I’ve been mistaken for a girl consistently. It’s never bothered me, I’ve more just thought it was a bit silly.

Aside from that physical discrepancy, I’ve always felt rather feminine in general. Not that I wasn’t a boy though, but that I was girly for what a boy “should be.” A bit sensitive and soft, in a broad sense. I have verbalized that specific sentence, “I’ve always felt sort of feminine,” to my parents and friends at least once or twice over the last few years. 

For example as regards to sexual foreplay in specific, when I feel “sexy”, I don’t generally (although maybe sometimes do) feel it in a buff, strong, muscular, masculine way, I more feel it in a feminine, sneaky, teasy kind of way.

One of the things that got my gears turning was when I made a friend who was openly non-binary. I thought they were cute from the moment I met them. Before I knew they were non-binary, I was attracted to them. They tweeted one time about how if someone had a crush on them, then they were gay. That made me wonder, am I gay then? I have undoubtably been attracted to several non-binary people since. My caveat is that they’ve all been feminine presenting.

So I’m very, very lost.

Only yesterday I saw the term “demi-boy” but I feel like I maybe prefer just non-binary in a broad sense. I question if I’m non-binary and want to use he/they pronouns because I feel rather feminine for some who is AMAB.

So then if I’m attracted to girls and I’m non-binary, am I gay? Or if I’m attracted to girls and only femme non-binary people, am I straight? Am I cishet? Am I cis and bi?

You never really reach feeling full masculine or feminine, but yeah. Hopefully you get the point.

Uhm, okay. To the awkward question part (imo). Okay. So sometimes on my feminine &amp; agender days i feel more dysphoric then masculine days because my body parts don't necessarily match what I view androgyny and feminism as.
I'm debating wether or not i want to transition. As of now I'm talking HRT and not surgeries.
My viewpoint on this is that on Masculine days and maybe agender days, I can wear a binder and call it good. Obviously, i may be missing something and binders may be painful to wear or something.

Self-Awareness:  Recognition through Implicit Attitude Tests -

 K. Croy

Implicit Attitude Tests (IAT) are fascinating to me.  I strive to fully understand the why, when and how in the realm of my mental self. I decided to take two IATs, One contrasting Heterosexuality and Homosexuality and another on Gender and Career and Family. The results from the one about human sexuality did not surprise me but the results from the Gender Role test were definitely perplexing. 

The first Implicit Attitude Test was to see if I favored Homosexuals over Heterosexulas. I was met with a heavy lean towards Homosexuals. This was not surprising to me at all for I am  part of the LGBTQ+ Community. That is really only the surface, as I look further there are other speculations why I lean towards this attitude.  

When I was very young I was sheltered from the community, I had zero clue it even existed. As I got a little older, about nine years old, I remember hearing casual and ‘humorous’ homophobia in the school yard and at home.  We never actually spoke about homosexuality in my household while my siblings and I were growing up. It was a veil of mystery but my autistic self was curious and why the normal people around me didn't seem to like it. With limited resources, this was before the internet was widely available, I shoved the thoughts aside because I worried about the bullying I would receive if I looked it up at the library.  My early teenage years was when my older sister brought a girlfriend home from college.  My family did not know she was dating someone of the same sex. Eruptions of hurt flowed onto her and this was terrifying, for both of us. I still did not fully understand but that was the day I became an ally. 

As I became an adult I learned more and more and found the Homosexual Community much easier to belong to than the Heterosexual. I found close connections with supportive people (eventhough I was not openly queer at the time.)  This was very different from the consistent emotional abuse I had come to expect from my heterosexual romantic and ‘friendships’, although I have witnessed healthy heterosexual relationships in my own life.  My journey to  realize my true self has been very tough but the support from the community, online and locally, has been paramount in my mental health.  

My family, except for aforementioned sister, has no idea that I am a Non-Binary Queer person.  From what I witnessed early on,  unless I want to marry a female bodied person, they shouldn’t need to know.  I will take this information from the Implicit Attitude Test as an affirmation.

In contrast, the other Implicit Attitude Test I took was to see if 

I associated the female gender with family and caregiving and males with career and success. The results showed me I associated gender with the traditional roles. At first glance, this was surprising to me but upon further introspection the surprise faded. 

I was reared by a mother who was a single parent of four young children while she was receiving her Master’s Degree in Health Care Administration.  She married my step father when I was 4. He was raised around strong female matriarchs so my mother and he wanted to make it known to a mostly female household that we could be anything, regardless of gender, if we worked hard enough.   The dichotomy of this rhetoric is that my family was also Jewish and strict. We were taught traditional gender roles through temple and the Old Testimate. I also was bombarded by the socio political ideals of the mid nineties to early 2000’s of my childhood. Women were caretakers and men worked in most movies, cartoons and music.  There was very little push in pop culture for Female main characters that showed strength in their femininity. Now before we blame my test results on religion, pop culture and family, let's also take into account biological and instinctual needs. 

I am thankful that my mother has raised independent, strong females. I do disagree that she wanted us to find a career, marry and have children on a timeline  “Because that is what women do”.  Biologically, Women are predispositioned to be more nurturing while Men are predispositioned to be protectors. But through time, shifts in roles have become increasingly accepted going as far as the modern day feminist movement and men taking their wive’s last name.  

These tests have really made me look deeper into the conflicting views of my upbringing and societal pressure of being born a female. This has played a role in me hiding myself for many years and fighting my identity on the gender spectrum.  I have recently taken the step to embrace myself as a non-binary human and found great empowerment through the journey. I hope that I will use this empowerment to fully be open with my family even with their traditional views. I see now how the conflicting views within my upbringing, would create confusion in a malleable adolescent mind. I still have a desire to have a family in some capacity for my traditions are still a part of my life, I see it being in a very non traditional sense, for I am uncertain the type of human I may fall in love with.  These tests have made me aware of the duality of experiences that have shaped me into the person I have become. I will take these results and use them to ‘iron out’ other aspects of my true self and look forward to becoming even more confident and honest about who I truly am.",NonBinaryTalk,Implicit Attitude Tests and Psychology Essay,1585642188.0,"{'created_utc': 1585616988, 'id': 'fs3fkl', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': "" (if you want to take one for fun:    [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/) )\n\n \n\nSelf-Awareness:  Recognition through Implicit Attitude Tests -\n\n K.
