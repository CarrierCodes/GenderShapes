the reason it even came up in the first place was because my mom was mentioning how my younger sister gets incredibly painful periods, but she doesn’t want to put her on birth control because she’s “too young”. i retaliated by saying that hormones aren’t necessarily bad, and just because “your body has a natural process” doesn’t mean that the process is good or works for everyone. and then i fucked up and said that i’m going to start testosterone and that’s not bad. 

we kinda glazed over that and i thought that was the end of it. until today. she texts me and asks me next time i’ll be in town (i live 1+hours away). and then she called me and left a voicemail that just said to call her. and then texted me and said to call her. 

i freaked out a bit, thought that maybe someone was sick or something so i called her back. 

she said that she and my step dad (divorced, not on great terms) want to have a chat with me about my future &amp; when would i be available for that?

then the kicker. she said that they’d prefer if it was just me alone, and that i don’t bring my partner of 2 years with me. my partner is very supportive of my transition &amp; always takes my side.

I get a lot of euphoria when I look more masculine and maybe starting a low dose of T would help me with my dysphoria.

I'm honestly still battling the feeling of impostor syndrome, even though I've told myself again and again that the feelings I have, and that I have had my whole life, all point to this being the right decision, and that I've been actively talking about it for *years.* I also feel a little small ab it bc my fiance came with but he was kind of reserved the whole time since he's more introverted and this kind of change freaks him out, even though he's supportive.

So when I started to question my gender identity most of the things that popped up for me were pride stuff and people saying there's no shame in being trans (I identified as a trans male for a while, important for later) and so little 13 year old me was like huh I guess there's no reason to hide any of this then 

My phone wallpaper for a while was a decorated trans flag. I took this phone to school and would show it to people when they asked for the time or just unlocked it in front of them for projects and stuff. When I first started binding with two sports bras I straight out asked my mom if my chest looked flatter. I asked teachers to group me in with the boys when they separated us for events. I literally told my mom I was a boy and upset people didn't see me that way (to which she responded I couldn't expect people to treat me like something I'm not, but that's another story.)

All of this in the course of about two or three years, before I started considering nonbinary as an option. During these two years I obviously became more exposed to transphobic views and the like. As a result, I kept this exploration mostly a secret. 

Now older, I found myself surprised that people somehow know even though I didn't tell them though looking back it all makes sense. 

Now though, some people have also been more direct with their views. Examples being an English teacher explaining the difference between different pronouns (I live in a Spanish speaking country but am a native English speaker), and feeling the need to turn to me and say: ""And no matter what she does a girl will never be a boy, isn't that right?""

Or when I asked my religious aunt why things had to be so black and white when it came to her rules, and she responded by saying that's just how things are, you are either good or bad, then take a step towards me and say ""You are either a boy or a girl. No matter what you do you'll always be a girl. That's just how things are.""

Both times I responded in stunned silence since I was caught off guard. I know in my mind this not to be true, but I'm not sure how to respond to that, if I should at all.

I tried coming out as nonbinary but they didn't understand and I didn't know how to explain and wasn't ready to stick up for myself so that's not exactly a secret either now haha

2020-08-11 18:10:03,i7wspo,8,1,"Hi, new here. This is a throwaway account, mostly trying to see if I'm off my rocker.

I'm not really sure if I fit in here, and I don't really know whats been going on with me lately. For starters, I'm 25 yrs old amab. I'm large, hairy, muscular, and masculine presenting. And I enjoy being that way. I like looking and feeling like a man. 

But when I was a kid I wanted to be a girl. I'd steal my sisters underwear or try on my mom's makeup when I was home alone. I secretly wanted to wear dresses and even developed early crushes on other boys. When I hit puberty most of those feelings went away, and I grew up as a typical boy, playing sports, and video games and whatnot. As far as sexuality goes I eventually come to a place where I embraced that I'm bi. I've thought nothing of it for years. I'm a (relatively) healthy and stable young man. 

So in the last 2 or 3 years, and this year in particular I've been feeling more and more that I wish I lived in a different body, or could experience life from a female perspective. But by that same coin I don't consider myself a woman, nor do I want to transition. I also don't want to come off sounding like some kind of ""gender tourist"" or like I'm romanticizing these very real and difficult struggles that trans folk experience. I literally spend entire days wishing I could step outside of my body, and into one with a completely different form, where I could live and act more feminine, and wear makeup and dress in skirts. Its maddening and confusing because I love my body, I spent all this time and effort into building it into what it is. I love wearing facial hair, and having muscles, and being performatively strong. I love the non toxic aspects of masculinity. 

For this reason I thought it'd be appropriate to post this here. The closest I can rationalize is that I might be some kind of latent nb. I literally don't know what to do about it. DAE wish they could just swap bodies? Am I crazy?

I keep going back and forth between god I don't want to have to come out again and God Im so sick of this I just want to come out and get it over with. But I don't want to talk about my gender anymore. I just want to live my life as me. I don't want to be some specimen for cis people to dissect. Just respect me and let me live my life. On top of that, I don't know which pronouns to tell my extended family to use. At school I use he/him in order to blend in and maybe make some friends because most cis people don't understand nonbinary identities where I live. I also use they/them but I will only use exclusively they/them in specifically LGBTQ+ safe spaces. 

About a year or two ago, I told my dad I wanted to use he/him and be called a different name. That didn't go so well. A little after that he saw my name as my preferred name on an account, which we both pretended like it didn't happen for some time after that.

I decided while I was looking into it more I would have people on the Internet refer to me as they/them(I hadn’t told anyone about questioning my gender identity, even the few people I was out to about my romantic/sexual orientation) and I kinda liked the idea of that, so I stuck with it.

I definitely would not describe myself as a tomboy growing up and I don’t think anyone I know would either, I wore dresses when I was told to, and if I needed to look nice I was usually required to wear a skirt.

I never wear skirts or dresses now, but that’s just a personal preference. I also was a very active kid, and wearing a dress or a skirt limited that, even wearing shorts underneath, but I’m not active now that I’m always wearing large hoodies to cover most of my body. 

I was referred to as a woman the other day and it physically hurt in my chest, but I don’t want to be referred to as a man. I have two brothers and two sisters, and when I think about them calling me their little sister or little brother, I definitely prefer sister, but I would prefer neither. 

I told my best friend, but I feel like since I’ve changed the label of my sexuality so much that she wouldn’t believe me(I originally told her bi, then gay, then polyromantic and sexually attracted to females, then I went back to gay), and my other friends too who I’ve only told that I was gay. I haven’t told anyone that I currently am labeling myself as panromantic and demisexual.

2020-08-15 04:37:18,ia19ud,3,1,"(TW: light discussion on depression and dysphoria) 

I’m AFAB, and I’ve called myself genderqueer for a long time, but it’s really only been in the last few months (since I moved out on my own) that I’ve finally fully accepted it and what it means for me. It’s been a very long road to get here.

Ever since I learned what top surgery was (like 6 years ago now?? Damn) I’ve fantasized about getting it and having a flat (or at least smaller) chest. But it always seemed out of reach for me. I didn’t know what the process was, and I never thought I’d be able to afford it. I was also pretty depressed, and had a hard time envisioning a future where I could exist in general. I was extremely closeted, and wished for an “excuse” to have my breasts removed, so I could do it without having to tell my parents.

Now, I’m in a pretty good place. I’ve moved out, I have insurance, and I’ve actually managed to land a job that involves helping other trans people, and have met a couple of top surgeons through there. I’m out to friends and my work and they use my name and pronouns. My family doesn’t know, but I’m sure my mom and a couple others suspect.

A couple months ago I put on a binder and looked at myself and thought “oh right, THAT’S what I’m supposed to look like!” It was this euphoria and comfort with my body that I haven’t had in so long. But unfortunately seeing myself in my binder more has meant having even WORSE dysphoria on the days I can’t wear it. Every time I see myself without it I just... feel disconnected. There are SO many cute things I would wear if they didn’t trigger my dysphoria so badly. I know it would help my confidence a lot.

But now that I’m in a place where top surgery is within reach, I’m hesitating and starting to doubt myself. I know a big part of it has to do with the fact that if I have top surgery, I’ll have to come out to my family. We’re close, and I’ve mostly gotten over the fear that they will disown me, but I’m worried they won’t understand me. And the surgery part itself is pretty scary too.

So... other trans masc folks... how did you know you were ready for top surgery? What were your own reasons for getting it? Were you scared before? How did you explain to others?

Any advice or stories, I’d love to hear them!",NonBinaryTalk,How do you know if you’re ready for top surgery?,1597491438.0,"{'created_utc': 1597466238, 'id': 'ia19ud', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '(TW: light discussion on depression and dysphoria) \n\nI’m AFAB, and I’ve called myself genderqueer for a long time, but it’s really only been in the last few months (since I moved out on my own) that I’ve finally fully accepted it and what it means for me. It’s been a very long road to get here.\n\nEver since I learned what top surgery was (like 6 years ago now?? Damn) I’ve fantasized about getting it and having a flat (or at least smaller) chest. But it always seemed out of reach for me. I didn’t know what the process was, and I never thought I’d be able to afford it. I was also pretty depressed, and had a hard time envisioning a future where I could exist in general. I was extremely closeted, and wished for an “excuse” to have my breasts removed, so I could do it without having to tell my parents.\n\nNow, I’m in a pretty good place. I’ve moved out, I have insurance, and I’ve actually managed to land a job that involves helping other trans people, and have met a couple of top surgeons through there. I’m out to friends and my work and they use my name and pronouns. My family doesn’t know, but I’m sure my mom and a couple others suspect.\n\nA couple months ago I put on a binder and looked at myself and thought “oh right, THAT’S what I’m supposed to look like!” It was this euphoria and comfort with my body that I haven’t had in so long. But unfortunately seeing myself in my binder more has meant having even WORSE dysphoria on the days I can’t wear it. Every time I see myself without it I just... feel disconnected. There are SO many cute things I would wear if they didn’t trigger my dysphoria so badly. I know it would help my confidence a lot.\n\nBut now that I’m in a place where top surgery is within reach, I’m hesitating and starting to doubt myself. I know a big part of it has to do with the fact that if I have top surgery, I’ll have to come out to my family. We’re close, and I’ve mostly gotten over the fear that they will disown me, but I’m worried they won’t understand me. And the surgery part itself is pretty scary too.

2020-08-15 07:02:21,ia2y8j,3,1,"Hi all! I'm an AMAB demiguy and a few different things lately have led me to believe I may want to do some surgical transitioning, so to say; I don't experience much genital dysphoria, but I've always wanted to appear more feminine in my figure (less straight-bodied, more curvy). The thing is, it never occurred to me that it was appropriate for me to want to surgically transition given my gender, but after dealing with my second bout of epididymitis (got it from a work injury, I'll put the story in the comments cause it's actually kinda amusing) I've been thinking more about my testes and what they do for me; that is, producing testosterone and producing my ""masculinity"". Between the pain from the epididymitis and my want to be more feminine, I've begun wondering if I should just have them removed and replaced with prosthetics.

I've begun doing research on castration and orchiectomy and have only been able to come up with limited info on what an orchiectomy does for a person as far as physical and hormonal changes go. From what I've gathered, the lack of testosterone can cause you to put on weight (no issue for me since I'm only 140 lbs) and accumulate fat in the hips and chest, which would be nice, but can also interfere with sexual performance and cause osteoperosis over time without HRT. That being said, I've been wondering what supplemental treatments I would want to go along with the procedure. I don't think I'd want to undergo testosterone replacement (cause then what's the point), but I don't know if it would be better for me to consider no HRT, estrogen replacement, or both E and T if that's something people do?

2020-08-16 22:53:42,ib2bn8,3,1,"My first post on this forum, I wanted this to be celebratory, but I don’t feel it went as well as it could have :/

Context: My biological sex is female and my gender Identity is non-binary (I am 15 years old).

I have always felt non-binary (despite the times in elementary school when I would try to convince myself otherwise). When I was about 11 years old, I began to have deep depression about my gender, and I was questioning my identity every day for about 3 years, until I was 14. In the process, I considered myself to be trans FTM for about 2.5 years. I was getting into arguments with my mother about my period, which gave me extreme dysphoria and sometimes made me suicidal. After a very low period in my life last winter (2019), I began realizing that I probably wasn’t transgender, but I definitely wasn’t female. So in the summer, my family and I decided that I was probably non-binary.

Although it might seem like I came out last summer (and my family supported me), I am still extremely tired of being misgendered, even by those I love and my friends. Additionally, it upset me yesterday when my mother said that teenage boys are checking me out because I look feminine—that cut me like a knife. It made me feel as if she did not remember from last summer my gender identity—but the even worse part is that my apparent “femininity” might even be a reality.

I can’t understand why my progressive and LGBTQ+-supportive parents still somehow consider me a “girl.” I thought we had been through this so many times and spend countless hours arguing about it, but clearly it didn’t do anything (or rather, I still look like a “girl”). My parents identify as non-binary in personality, but not physically. Why can’t they realize that I want to ***look indistinguishable from male or female*** and that so many physical traits of mine bother me deeply? For example, I am only about 5’2, and my a lot of my face is very feminine. My goal is to be non-binary leaning towards masculine.

Enough ranting...I’d like to ask you for some tips. Since my face is rather feminine, are there facial exercises I can do to get rid of excess plumpness/sharpen my facial structure without surgery? Have you done these and do they work? Also, my mother has told me I can cut my hair short—what are some fairly longish haircuts that could be seen as both masculine and feminine or indistinguishable?

2020-08-18 01:53:10,ibrwre,4,1,"Sooooo, this is my first post on reddit, you have to know there might be errors (English is not my first language, so I might make some mistakes). I hope this is the right subreddit, if not, please let me know.

Some background story: I’m (22) a queer AFAB person who has never actually cared about being feminine or masculine since I was basically a toddler; I’ve always liked both feminine and masculine things and dressed up as I felt to and my parents have never actually cared about that.

During my first year of high school, I started having issues with my mental health (some of them still protracted up ‘til now), I was discovering my sexuality (which has been such a journey) and I felt like my body wasn’t the body I wanted to be in. During that year I thought a lot about transitioning to male, but after that period of time I put my questioning on my gender identity aside since I had always thought it was caused by the distress I went through.

Fast forward to some years later, I went and spent almost a year abroad where I met lots of LGBTQ+ people who helped me with my internalised biphobia and gave me a place I felt like I belonged to, then I went back to my country, met some amazing people from my city who I started talk to while I was abroad, finally realised I’m not cis which, to me, is a big deal and I’m not able to fully accept it. 

Most of the time I have dysphoria on my chest: I have big breasts and I’m thinking about getting a breast reduction (which could happen in years since I’m studying, have no job or money) to a maybe A/B cup, however some times I’m fine with having them since I lived with them for almost a decade, more likely because I got used to have this presence in my life.

I mean, I love boobies, I like them aesthetically, but when I look at myself into the mirror I don’t feel like they belong to me and I want them off, and almost don’t have any bottom dysphoria. 

Some members of my family know my sexuality and they’re fine with it. Not really supportive, but fine (especially because my family is religious). I know they wouldn’t be supportive of this. 

I’m very scared and I feel like all of this along with my mental health gotten worse during quarantine, are taking my relationships downhill.

I intend to start therapy - again - but I’m afraid my therapist won’t understand since I wouldn’t fit in the trans binary, and I don’t want to fully transition (even though I’m not sure of this, I feel like even if I fully transitioned I would still be in the non-binary spectrum) but I don’t know if it is because this is my identity or because I’m just gaslighting myself because of my fears.

I’m afraid I’ll not be taken seriously and always be seen as the “girl” I’m not by people close to me, especially because in my first language everything is gendered and there’s no neutral pronouns and I’m fine with people using she/her (I use she/her too sometimes, however when I’m talking about me I try to keep a gender neutral language, usually using enormous turns of phrases).

I’m literally terrified by the thought of people I love not accepting me or leaving because of this, and that I’ll never find someone who truly loves me for who and not “what” I am.

(I first posted this on r/NonBinary but it was immediately removed upon posting? :c probably my own heck-up, so here I am.)

So,  I've been out as NB for a little over a year now. When I got my new job  back in December, I decided to go all-in and slap my pronouns on my  resume. Turns out this was a *wonderful*  idea -- not only do the folks at my job support and respect my pronouns  (they/them), but they let me run my Gender and Pronouns in the  Workplace workshop (appropriately titled, ""Who is Ze? A Workshop on  Gender and Pronouns in the Workplace"") that I built for my former job,  not even 3 weeks into my new employment! My colleagues are incredibly  supportive, and I'm wicked lucky.

However,  in the last \~5 months or so, I've been feeling like my name (Ali)  doesn't fit me as well anymore -- I prefer going by Al. I've expressed  this to colleagues that I'm close with, in private, but for some reason,  I'm very nervous to share this to the rest of my team, or even my job  at a wider level. Now, I should note that my company is very small, less  than \~100 people, and we all communicate on Slack. My partner suggested  that I simply change my name on Slack, drop a note to my closer team  explaining the change, and explain the change if anyone messages me  privately. But, by doing this, I fear I'd owe a larger explanation to  the rest of my company.

So -- has anyone had any experience in this? And, if so, how did you do it?

much thanks!

2020-08-21 02:08:42,ido02p,5,1,"Hello Everyone,
This is more of a rant, but would love any advice or comments.

I have been out as nonbinary for about two years now. Like many people, I did so at a time that seemed extremely inopportune, but in hindsight was the exact time I needed to come out to myself — my second year of a PhD program, about 3 months after the hardest break up of my life, and at a time where many changes occurred in my family (my niece was born, my relationship with my immediate family was suffering, as I never came home). Looking back on it, I realize that it was the culmination of these events that allowed me the space to say what I had been feeling since my sister playful put me in a Cinderella costume when I was five and I felt beautiful. 

As I have come into my identity, my particular brand of nonbinary, I have learned a great deal about myself and honestly love myself so much more than I ever have. I also feel more affirmed in my identity as a Black queer person since coming to terms with my gender. My experience dating has often caused a great blow to my self-confidence though. Since I have initially come out, I’ve had 2 main relationships: 1) with a queer, cis-White women and 2)  with a White, queer, nonbinary person. Both people were great in many ways, but I never felt affirmed in my Blackness by either of them (or any White partners  in my life to be honest), despite clearly stating what I needed.

Since this time, I have tried Tinder, Okcupid, Lex, and Bumble. My problem has not been a lack of likes or matches, but the fact that when I talk to people they have 1) not done enough unpacking of their privileges, which manifests as rude questions, racist, or transphobic comments or 2) cis folks who like me, because they think I am an unproblematic man (to most I look like a cis-man). Now, I know that when dating cis people, you have to really break gender down to them, so I have. I expect that. What hurts a bit is that I don’t get many likes or matches from nonbinary or trans folx, because I don’t read as queer, despite it being very upfront on all of my profiles. It also kinda sucks that I don’t get a lot of likes from POCs. 

In short, I am just out here in the world trying to have a healthy, happy with a queer cutie. Do you all have any other suggestions for data apps? Or sites to meet trans and nonbinary folks, preferable of color?

First of I am 21 and seriously I am questioning from 5-6 years but did stuff indicating dysphoria before that like pulling your shirt to hide your chest. To be fair I actually saw myself just as me at that time ,the word girl was what other people called me so I was thinking I am one.I have strong desire to have top but some of my thought makes it hard for me to feel valid and trans enough to have it .

My dysphoria isn't constant in some days I just don't feel it or I am feeling this numb feeling . Not each day I want to die when I put sports bra or normal one but still don't want show outside home like that the though itself is something I don't like at all. In some days my binder makes my dysphoria worse in others I feel like people can see through the binder and I feel like fraud [ I will put copy of my post on Instagram about regarding binding and how I feel about it].
 
 I can't pick name and label ,I am pretty sure it is either nonbinary trans , agender or genderfluid. Here where I live we don't have nb or they so when I am at home it is kind of tolerable because no one sees me,but outside I feel I must pick a side. And because of all that I am afraid I may regret TOP but I want it so so so bad even when I feel ok seeing my chest [ I feel less discomfort sometimes without clothes but not all the time ] And this numb feeling is terrible as if I have cotton or black hole in my mind I just walk do things but can't feel my interactions with the world and the emotions it makes me feel. I feel empty and can't connect to my sence of self or my emotions as if the file in my head for gender and identity don't exist ,this is probably depersonalisation one of the less unknown signs of dysphoria. 

I have this thing that sometimes I don't feel anything when I wake up for 30 min to one hour, and sometimes if I feel ok. In days like this my mind decides to scream at me that just because in this day I are willing to go out with bra and I will tolerate it/ don't find it repulsive that means I am confused cis girl so I will never get TOP surgery because it is mutilation and then I put the binder because I don't want to make it more obvious that I am born AFAB but it too feel wrong and so I try to not cry by distracting myself [ also my skin is itching because of the binder even after I take it off]
 
 Because most people find new name and pronounce and ect I feel bad or not trans enough to change something because I don't have those things even a label. I was thinking about being agender too in my case I have like core identity and in some days I feel it's external part more feminine [ more line neutral or a bit fem ] or masculine if that makes sense. But what remains is my desire for TOP my behaviour is the one that changes ,I act more flamboyant.

Someone I know told me that most of my thoughts are coming from internalised transphobia and I think it might be true but it is so weird because from as long as I can remember no matter the fact that my parents aren't pro LGBTQ I always was ally and 1000% believe trans and nb people exist

How my brain makes me see things is that I must suffer as that trans guy that can't even shower or look at himself and is in constant agony in order to be valid and have the right to make change and this apply only for me ,like I will not judge someone for that or at least I thought that, because in my mind they know themselves or have stronger dysphoria than me. Similar thing apply about the name and label - if I don`t know them before all else I don`t feel really this way and so I can`t trust my instinct to have top that is what my mind is telling me .

 This below is copy of the text I posted on my Instagram;

I had several insta profiles before and posted my art there but it wasn't my thing and still isn't.The reason I made insta is to help myself. I want to find answers to the many questions and doubts I have but also I want to show this side of the coin that I almost never see the side of constant doubts the side way before the clear answer.

It was long joinery for me to get #binder because at that time when I decided I want one I also wanted to keep it secret from my parents. It was about a year ago. The first one that I payed for and a friend bought for me was tank top #gc2b but it was too small. After I found someone to use it I waited about a month to buy new one this time the short version and one size bigger [The one you see on the pic]. I have short hands so I couldn't put it on because my hands couldn't touch the part that was rolled up in the back. And so I bough one more after about 1 to 3 months. Finally I could wear it! It was white tank top. With time I learned to use this one too.

But after some time it stopped being ok. Yes it was cool to have flat chest but even with it I hunch my back a lot to the point I am afraid I may not be able to correct my posture after I stop doing it. The binder makes my skin itchy and that along side with the pressing on my chest makes it hard for me to not pay attention to it. 

Instead of feeling better I feel worse because I think that I am a fraud ,I feel as if people can see through my T-shirt and the binder and know I still have these things there. It makes be doubt my validity and my right to have TOP surgery because I feel uncomfortable with the binder on.

The illusion I had that the binder will be this magical item that will make everything ok it sometimes true for some people but not for me .And despite all that I still wear it because even if I feel less dysphoric with sports bra because it is easier to not pay attention to it wearing bra will destroy the small chance of someone using he not she so I will continue wear it .",NonBinaryTalk,"I am so tired of uncertainty ,what you think about my situation?

2020-08-26 23:40:26,iha71f,5,1,"to preface, no one owes the world androgyny to be nonbinary. i know that my identity (agender) and pronouns (they/them) are not tied to my presentation (distinctly femme.) that said, being immediately perceived as a cis woman is dysphoric for me, and being able to trouble that assumption in some way is important to me, personally, even though i’d never assign that requirement to anyone else.

that said: any tips on balancing a femme aesthetic preference with more androgyny? it feels like nonbinary fashion advice is “wear skirts and grow out your hair” for AMAB people and “wear menswear and get a pixie cut” for AFAB people. the problem is that i fucking love my long hair and dresses. my standard outfit is an a-line midi skirt and a tucked in top with flats.

so far, my ideas are:
* wear a binder with my standard outfits
* sweaters over collared shirts in place of my usual shells/t-shirts 
* when formalwear is necessary at work, add a tie and blazer instead of heels and a loose cardigan
* accept that pants are more androgynous and wear loose, cuffed slacks

So, what are the differences between these: gender neutral / androgynous / agender / gender non-conforming?

Are there any other genders similar to these, like ""100% neutral""? 

I've been doing some research but never really understood bc the definitions of these labels seem to beejia really similar and kinda the same so, im trying to educate myself here ahah correct me if I'm saying anything wrong as well.

2020-08-31 21:35:02,ik75oj,28,1,"I'm an AFAB boyflux person, and I've been out as a trans man for around a year. 

I started identifying as boyflux recently, but I've known for years that there was probably some nonbinary element to my gender. I came out as a trans man because I needed to do something about my dysphoria, and I didn't feel the need to have all the intricacies of my gender figured out (at this point I was tired of questioning, and my dysphoria was starting to become something I couldn't safely ignore).

Now I have a better understanding of my gender, but I'm not sure if it's worth re-coming out. 

The biggest factor here is that I want to start using he/they pronouns instead of exclusively he/him, but I  know a lot of people don't respect they/them, and I guess I'm too scared to try. 

I know no-one can decide this for me, but if anyone has had a similar experience, could you please tell me how it went? Any input would be greatly appreciated.

At the middle of the day / late evening of the first day they slept at home I started feeling numb and fat and gross and unemotional but also had some quick  emotional bursts when I hide in the bathroom.I am used to the short version of my birth name used by my parents and also me having tolerable dysphoria at home when I am without binder but one of my cousins use something similar to sister in our language to refer to me and her whole family encourages her 3 years old brother to do the same. In general they emphasized on my assigned gender a lot. 

They left today [ the end of the second day] I was so numb although I reached overly emotional at the very end but when I entered the bathroom T started crying especially after looking at myself and was still feeling numb but discussed at my body.
