2019-02-01 22:05:13,am7e1s,4,1,Hi! So I have recently started to be somewhat confused about my gender identity. I am not dysphoric about my body but I have always found that I don’t particularly like being referred to as a “woman” or “female”. It just doesn’t sit quite right. I don’t think I want to change anything about my body and I’ve always been relatively androgynous in my presentation (even though I’m not adverse to dressing very feminine either). Basically I’m just not really sure where I stand in terms of gender and feel a bit like I would be intruding to call myself non-binary when I don’t feel uncomfortable in my skin  ,NonBinaryTalk,Confused and questioning,1549083913.0,"{'created_utc': 1549058713, 'id': 'am7e1s', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi!

2019-02-06 01:18:52,anl947,2,1,"Hi! I’m 20 years old, and a few years ago, I started to question my gender identity; however, i quickly brushed it off as “just a thought” or “low body image” and tried to push the thoughts down. It was something I didn’t have the time or energy to think about, and it wasn’t something I /wanted/ to think about. 

It’s been some years though, and the thoughts still persist. There are many days where I feel fine as a female! I’ll feel content dressing and presenting feminine, being called she/her, and I’ll feel good and happy about my body and any clothes that might show it off. 

There are also many days, however, where I feel uncomfortable with the she/her pronouns and my feminine presentation. I’ll feel uncomfortable with my breasts and wish they weren’t there, going so far as to try to squish them down or hide them with baggy clothes. I’ll hate the length of my hair, the femininity of my face, and ultimately feel uncomfortable at the thought of going to classes because I don’t want to be seen as I am. 

I never know what kind of day it will be when I wake up, and I honestly wish I had more of an androgynous face/haircut/body so that maybe I’d feel a bit happier in my skin? 



I’m not quite sure how to interpret these feelings though. Any advice?
