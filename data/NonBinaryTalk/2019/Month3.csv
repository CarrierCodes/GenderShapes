I’d known what it *was* I’d just never done any research, and now that I have I’m honestly really surprised at how well it fits? 

Some parts of me have always, always hated being a girl. Thinking back on it, I even had issues with it in childhood. I never liked being made to wear skirts or dresses as a kid, for some reason it just made me uncomfortable and I’d always insist on wearing shorts underneath whatever it was if I had no other choice, but I assumed I was just more of a tomboy.
