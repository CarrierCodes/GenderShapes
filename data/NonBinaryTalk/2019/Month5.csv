2019-05-07 01:01:30,blkapm,3,5,"When I was first hired at my job one of my managers asked me my pronouns in the best direct and casual way! And later they mentioned they also identified as trans and went by they, and to let them know if I needed anything.

Pretty soon after I started I realized nobody ever used they/them pronouns for my boss. Even someone who was in the room when my boss told me that and said “so-and-so has heard all about this” in relation to something related. Most people in my department have been pretty good about using my pronouns, so it seems like most of them aren’t aware of what pronouns my boss prefers.

We also have mutual friends and are part of some of the same circles and interested in the same activist activities. We’ve almost ended up going to the same social gatherings before, just not quite. Really quickly after I was hired they set a very casual and personal tone with me, and they have asked me to text them about quick work-related things before.
 
Unfortunately now I don’t interact with them much at work, and anytime I do there are tons of other people around. I’ve wanted to ask them for a long time how it would be most helpful for me to handle people mispronouning for them at work but it always felt awkward especially because of always having others around (also I am shy).
