2019-04-12 03:38:21,bc92w5,16,5,"Ever since 6th grade whenever I look in the mirror, I don’t see myself. At first, me being the person who blows things out of proportion, I thought, “what if I’m trans???”. Ever since then I’ve been so confused, and throughout me changing my clothing style, hair length, (I have a bob right now and used to have longer hair), and personality, I still haven’t found me. 
I always knew of non-binary genders, but I never really thought of me being one of them. As I grew up I starting watching a lot of trans youtubers, as well as following them on social media. I’ve never really understood why I’m so drawn to them. I recently found a non-binary person named Juno, and they’re really such an inspiration to me. After I found them I started to realize how many accounts I follow of trans and non-binary people, as well as LGBT+ accounts, which I figured was because I’m pansexual. Looking at Juno’s page, I keep thinking, “I want to look like that”. I’ve also been considering cutting my hair super short for around 3 years, but I can never commit to it. 
Sometimes I want to feel what it’s like to wear a binder, just so I can see if it feels like me. I don’t even know what it’s like, but I’ve tried binding with ace bandages to see what it’s like to have a flat chest, but it didn’t work. Some days I just want to put on a binder, a button up, cut my hair short, and go about my day. Other days I feel like I want to put on a dress, curl my hair, and wear a bunch of jewelry. I have tried wearing jewelry before, but whenever I put on I feel SO insecure that I take it off before I even leave the house. I also noticed that whenever I hang out with girls, I hate feeling girly with them. I don’t like painting my nails, or doing my hair, or really being feminine at all, but I always think I should be. Whenever I hang out with guys, I hate knowing that they see me as a girl. One time they were joking around about their “man boobs” (my friends are really weird lmao), all I wanted to do was get rid of the giant lumps sitting on my chest so I could feel like them. 
Since my feelings are never consistent and I base how I feel off of celebrities, I always feel like a fraud. I never really have real dysphoria, and it makes me feel like there’s no way that I’m not a girl, but some days I really hate being seen as a girl. People always talk about immediately knowing whether or not they identify as their gender, and I have never felt that, yet another reason I feel like a fraud. I also tend to base whether or not I want to become non-binary or any other gender on whether or not people will be attracted to me, which makes me wonder if what I’m feeling is actually real. I also already know what gender neutral name I would use if I wanted to transition, but I have no idea if I want to.

2019-04-17 11:52:44,be6up5,1,2,"I’m 13 years old, AMAB, and attracted to men. I think I’m nonbinary but I’m not sure about all. Here’s a list of all the stuff I’ve felt that supports and opposes being enby:

EVIDENCE I’M ENBY

&gt;General non-sexual fascination with intersex and the concept of androgyny - I naturally associate it with qualities such as freedom, beauty, and perfection, and have done so for a long time

&gt;I feel this kind of kinship/familiarity with content I’ve seen in trans and enby meme subs such as r/traa , r/ennn , and r/LateStageGenderBinary , a kinship I also felt with gay stuff before I discovered I was gay

&gt;I love feminine things like flowers, singing in high notes, skirts, earrings, and dresses

&gt;I hate many aspects of puberty, such as increased musculature, my voice dropping, and pubic hair

&gt;I’ve heard that confusion and constant self-doubt are incredibly common for enby and trans people

&gt;Even though I didn’t really show any signs of gender nonconformity as a young child, apparently many other people (such as out queen ContraPoints/Natalie Wynn) didn’t show these qualities either

&gt;I hate gender norms with a bitter passion

EVIDENCE I’M NOT ENBY

&gt;I’ve probably never felt dysphoria

&gt;I have this idea that has existed for a long time that people will not be comfortable with me showing effeminate qualities and doing effeminate things

&gt;I didn’t show much effeminacy when I was younger (at least according to my parents, who seem to be quite accepting of LGBTQ+ stuff)

&gt;I may have felt some kind of dysphoria from being feminine on two occasions - once when I wore a black skirt for a few hours and once when I wore this beautiful ring with a metal rose for a few minutes and pictured myself wearing it in my mind. I felt this kind of uneasiness/distress and I felt a relationship between it and femininity

2019-04-20 09:12:55,bfadld,3,6,"Hello I'm 25, assigned female at birth, and it only really recently occurred to me that I might be non binary. Can you guys help? 

When I was about 3 years old I decided I absolutely didn't want to be a girl. I refused to wear dresses, skirts or the colour pink. I disliked red because I thought it was too close to pink. By the time I was 5 I had a boys haircut. I have quite a feminine name - Rose - and used to hate how it clearly identified me as a girl.

I happily led my life as a boy up until puberty really, my family were cool with it and so was everyone at school. It was just a case of ""oh that's Rose, she's a boy"".

But then puberty came along. It was confusing. My body did things my friends bodies didn't. I got hips and boobs and couldn't pass convincingly as a boy anymore. By the time I was 16 I was trying to be a ""proper"" girl. I wore makeup, I wore a skirt to school, I made friends with girl groups. Even so I maintained a slight tomboy edge I think, but really this carried on until I was about 18/19. At university I went back to jeans and no makeup, met my boyfriend, and reserved ""girly"" stuff for nights out or special occasions.

Now I'm a few years out the other side of uni and I find that I'm uncomfortable in typically ""feminine"" clothes. I don't feel like myself when I wear a skirt or a dress. I feel like I'm dressing up as a woman. The word woman too - when I get called a woman it feels bizarre and slightly uncomfortable. My sister (27) told me she feels 100% like a woman and this threw me becasue I realised I definitely don't. I feel like an adult for sure, but the word woman just feels wrong. There's so much I associate with that word that I just don't associate with myself? I'm not intrinsicly uncomfortable being female (she/her doesn't bother me) , but only if I can do it in my way, which isn't really how everyone else sees a female behaving.

I don\'t want to make it a big announcement, but I\'m not really out to people. I\'m open and proud at school and at home and I wear my ""they/them"" pin almost every day. But I don\'t want to ""come out"" again. And sometimes they say the wrong pronouns in the middle of a sentence and I don\'t want to interrupt them and need to explain. Like in history class one day my teacher (who knows about my pronouns) used me as an example for something and she used my wrong pronouns like 10 times.

I have identified as nonbinary for a couple of years now, and have thankfully gotten to an okay place in my life where I’m financially independent from my family and have a supportive partner. I want to come out to them and have already written a letter to send to them, so now I’m at the point of deciding when to send it.

For anyone else who’s sent an e-mail to come out to their family, do you have any advice? Or just in general, tips on self care when coming out to a family that may not be supportive?
