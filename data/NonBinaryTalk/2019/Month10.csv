Alright guys, background time. So I've been identifying as Non-Binary-ish for about a year now. In my personal life I identify as NB especially with my wife and friends.

I bolt into the nearest bathroom, do what I need to do, start to walk out, and realize I was in the men's room. Now it was a DAY at work, and I was exhausted. I barely noticed the dude at the urinal. What got me was the Male-parental-figure who became very apologetic and began backing out of the bathroom with his young child. THEN i realized i was in the ""wrong"" restroom. And I immediately became embarrassed and apologetic, stating I was in the wrong room. 

Whutt?? 

On my walk back to my wife, I began to wonder what I had to apologize and be embarrassed for. I (personally) don't identify as male or female. It's not like anyone saw my ""private squares"". So what the heck?? 

Those of you who have been on this journey for a while, how did you ""get over"" this embarrassment/low-level fear? Does anyone have tips to help me gain confidence as an NB person?

For roughly 10 years I have been wanting to be both femme and masc (I am AMAB for context). I never felt welcome when I expressed these feelings to people who didn’t experience them. On and off depression, constant self-hatred, a controlling and abusive girlfriend, and other negativity kept me from exploring these feelings for 10 years. 10 years of thinking that I missed out on the real me and knowing that I was too cowardly to do anything about it. 

But in the last few months I have found communities of enbies and more broadly trans people online and IRL. By being so accepting of me and everyone else questioning, I found the courage to address my feelings and act on them.

So today I finally did it. I went to the store with my extremely supportive partner and she helped me find a cute dress and get the right undershirt to wear with it. When I had the outfit finished and went to the mirror it made me feel so good, like nothing I’ve ever felt before. I liked my body and how it looked for the first time in I don’t even know how long. I wept tears that came with the 1000 emotions I felt. They were happy for living the rest of my life as me but sad for having waited so long. 

So, thanks to y’all and my enbies and trans siblings everywhere, I’m doing it. I’m coming out to my classmates, my friends, and my acquaintances. I’m telling people to use they/them and call me by a new name, one that I based on my old name I chose.

Pseudoscience 
    -Noun
“a collection of beliefs or practices mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method.”

Gender Studies is a Pseudoscience because:
a) It has no scientific evidence proving it
b) There has been no psychological or biological cases in which a person has been neither gender (with the exception of intersex cases)
c) Universities commonly mistake this topic as a science, instead of social science (which is more philosophy than it is science)

If gender studies was the study of sexes (male and female) than it would be a science, although a very brief science.

I don't really know how to start off but here it goes.
I'm 25 AFAB who has been questioning themselves lately and have constant thoughts that I may be faking for attention.
I've been using They/Them pronouns for roughly 1yr 6mo and while I feel so much more comfortable with them (as well as he/him at times), it still feels like I'm just a faker.
I feel like I don't experience dysphoria like you're ""mean to"", to me, I just don't feel anything (in terms of gender) until something comes up (like having to use a public bathroom or being addressed as ""Ma'am/Lady/Girl"")
The only time it feels like I may experience dysphoria is when I get periods but then I just chalk it up to ""all AFAB people hate getting them so that's nothing different""

I just feel like I'm putting on a facade but at the same time I still dislike being female, feminine things (make-up, dresses, heels, jewelery) and feel alot more comfortable with appearing just neutral (with some rare exceptions)

So, in 2017 I told a friend I thought I was non-binary and began exploring my gender identity. I was first met with a lot of support, but romantic or sexual partners didn’t seem to understand (or want to). 

When i was in high school, I was out to my father as bisexual, and had my first girlfriend which he accepted fully, and was supportive. He raised me on his own, with my mom being absent, so it was simple. 

However, now my parents are remarried after a 15 year separation. I have a trans cousin, and my mom claims that she loves him so much, but constantly uses incorrect pronouns when speaking about him and uses his dead name. I always try to teach her, but she doesn’t change. 

Recently I got married and my partner (cis pan man) and I’s friends flew in, all of different variants of queer. it was such a happy and warm part of it all. My two enby best friends flew in and I talked to my parents before hand on how to use the correct pronouns for them, and my dad said, ‘oh ok it’s simple, just don’t overthink it!’, while my mom consistently misgendered my friends. I obviously stood up for them bc it made me mad and also hurt my feelings bc I know she would do the same to me if she knew I was enby. 

My in-laws are incredibly transphobic, and my husband got kicked out at a very young age because he was romantically involved with a trans woman. That being said, I don’t feel safe or comfortable at all coming out to them. 

I’ve been in my marital apartment for 4 months now and it’s done wonders for my freedom of gender expression since I don’t see anyone in my life who is outwardly transphobic to me, but I am also not out to anyone but my friends. I’ve been able to really grow into my authentic self these last few months. being able to dress masc whenever I want, got a new more masc haircut, etc. I’m becoming confident in my gender and am at a point where i’m tired of hiding who I am. it’s exhausting, and hurts me emotionally. 

So my question is- how do I come out to family? how did you teach older people in your life what being enby is? 

it is to the point where it depresses me to have to pretend like a woman. I don’t like using she/her pronouns at all. I feel like the older folks in my life understand being a trans woman or man, but think being non-binary is fake or doesn’t make sense. 

Any comments, advice, help, etc would be much appreciated!

2019-10-28 13:35:51,do8x93,4,4,"Hello reader and thank for taking some time to pay attention to my post 

So I am 24 years old French and even if I was “born” female my look was always androgynous. 
I never really felt or understood what girlhood or femininity despite my friends attempt to explain it to me. 
On the other hand people often think I am a boy because of the way I dress calling me sir/mister/etc.. that doesn’t bother me much and I rarely correct them but that doesn’t feel totally right either and like for femininity I have an hard time understanding what is masculinity or boyhood actually are. 
For me femininity and masculinity he way it was described to me and the way I understand it are mostly a series of coding going to one way or the other, expressed through clothes, makeup,etc...
And because of that I do not recognize myself in either one, and have an hard time seeing them for anything except a normative code

Before puberty, I liked dresses and feminine clothes. In fact, I chose to wear dresses and skirts even when I had the option to wear pants on some occasions. I wasn't that confused about which side of the gender binary I fell on. I never recoiled when referred to as a girl. I did strongly dislike the little-girl femininity associated with female childhood: I never played with dolls, preferring rather gender-neutral stuffed animals. I didn't like Disney princesses, pink, or playing school... but I was pretty damn sure I was a girl, if not a feminine one. I had all-female friends (though I was basically bullied out of having male friends by public accusations that I, a third grader, was dating them).

When I moved to a different school (located in a liberal city where people didn't think being gay was a sin!) I started to dress more masculine. As I saw girls wear formal slacks instead of skirts, I made that change in my own closet. And throughout early puberty (around the time when I switched schools), I found myself getting excited for symptoms that I knew would never appear. I was psyched to start shaving my face and/or growing a beard. I wanted that 12-inches-in-three-months male growth spurt *bad*.
