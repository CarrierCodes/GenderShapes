1. The obsession with pronouns. It feels like that's all anyone talks about it when it comes to nonbinary people. All the pronouns all the time. And I know pronouns are valid and helpful for a lot of people, helps them feel good, euphoric even, but for me I just don't care. I don't like any pronouns. They all feel uncomfortable. I hate when I go to queer spaces and they do the ""let's all introduce ourselves and our pronouns"" thing because I don't want to have to pick a pronoun. I don't ""prefer"" any of them. I don't want to be defined by it. Pronouns, even they/them and zi/zer etc, feel gendered in a way, because of my next issue...

2. Nonbinary feels like a gender in of itself. I feel like nonbinary should be all about tearing down the boxes for man and woman but instead it just feels like there's a box for nonbinary now. Like there's a role and pronouns for nonbinary identity. It doesn't feel like shedding away the jail cell that is gender, but just making another cell. There's clothes, hair styles, ways of talking about yourself...that's nonbinary. When it feels like nonbinary shouldn't be anything at all.

I found greygender is a decent enough spot for now, even if I'm not openly that.

And I dunno. I guess I'm thinking right now about how stressful i find my gender to be. I know that the more girlish I'm pushed to be, the more uncomfortable i am. I always hated being placed in girl groups (for social activities, i definitely don't hate them lol), and i think being forced to dress more feminine gives me some sort of... dysphoria? I know that i don't have to dress that way, but idk. When i do, it feels wrong. Even thinking about it gives me distress. It makes me feel less like myself and like i don't see myself in the mirror. 

I always kind of viewed myself as not really a girl but also not really a boy. Growing up, i wanted to do more of... i guess, male expectation things. And i know the following is based on gender stereotypes and all that, but the point is i did these things to feel more masculine. I wanted to be strong. I took up weightlifting, when men were called, i showed up (pushing cars out of the mud, pushing cars down the road, generally lifting heavy things), i dressed more GNC, and in a weird way, i viewed my friendships with girls like i was a boy. 

But at the same time, i don't really want to be a guy. Like, the whole hrt thing likely isn't something i want. I don't hate my body parts, even if i hate my body as a whole. 

And i guess its just really confusing. And scary, sort of. I don't want to be considered an attention seeker and i guess I'm also afraid that maybe i am just a sort of weird girl who is only at best just gnc.

2019-09-23 14:46:25,d87hzl,5,17,"I've been trying to compromise with her for a decade about my clothes. She took me shopping yesterday to find stuff we both like. I almost cried trying on jeans (the kind lady helping us said I had beautiful curves and my dysphoria said ""amen"" and you know how that is. She can't read minds, she didn't do anything wrong, my masculinity has just been very fragile lately? Per usual? Whatever.)

Anyway. I'm layering a plaid shirt she picked out and she blew up at me on the way to my university. Bc my bus stop is en route to her job, we live in Chicago, it's notoriously dangerous, I can't and don't try to convince my family to not worry for my safety. So she drops me off at my bus stop.

She was going on about how I'm asking to be raped and how I upset her and she's not dumb and isn't going to wait three or five years for me to come out as gay. I don't know what it is with people associating presentation with sexuality, and not identity. But whatever. We've been having this talk for almost ten years, now.

My aunt had this conversation with me last week and I came out to her as bisexual. She asked for my pronouns, and I told her they/them. She said ""We [her and my cousins] all already knew, so I don't know why you were so scared of just saying so, babe. I can't judge you because I'm not God. We still love you."" She asked her questions and I gave answers, and I think we both handled it well. It was funny and wholesome and I don't feel unsafe. 

However my mom said that she'd tell her lawyer and judge (she's in court with my dad) to get my dad to stop sending me money. Because I ""don't know how to spend it,"" gesturing to my outfit. *When I didn't suggest we buy clothes. I'm cheap as shit and am trying to save up for a car, and then for a year of rent. She's the one that buys something new literally everyday.* Not that anything is wrong with that. She's just really bad at saving money and doesn't listen to my advice. And she talked me out of accepting job offers, because I'm a freshman in college. We both want me to earn more scholarships. 

Anyway. She then said she isn't sending me to school ""to end up living an alternative lifestyle."" *It's not like I'm earning a degree in education to earn a living on commissions for the rest of my life?? Like??* Anyway. She said that she'd tell the judge to stop my dad from sending me money (because he refused to pay Child Support for over a decade, but I'm 18, now, so that's what the judge says is fair to my mom and I). And then she threatened to stop supporting me. That is if a) she finds out that I was hiding that I'm 'gay,' or b) I come out.

My boyfriend is bi, too, I asked him how he feels about me transitioning eventually, and he says he's absolutely fine with it. He says he wants me to be happy. 

LOL MY FAMILY KEPT ASKING ME IF HE'S GAY but anyway. My mom thinks we're each other's cover up? But the rest of my family like. Believes that we're actually dating lol. He's kinda femme, I'm kinda masc. I have high regards for him. He has high regards for me. They can see it. Lol. 

I came out at 14 and cut my hair without permission, and got kicked out. Like. It was only for a few days, but that was horrible. I couldn't focus in school because I had no idea where I was going to sleep later on. 

My entire family said I'd stay at either a correctional facility or a mercy home. It ended up being my grandmother's house, but I had to pray for change for an hour a day. So it wasn't horrible. I got to eat and sleep and wasn't rained on, and ended up at my mom's place once the dust settled.

But she said not to expect my dog to be home when and if I returned. I was so horrified that she gave him away. 

But I came home and there he was. Everything was a bluff. Only because the rest of my family told my mom that she was overreacting. 

But now I'm grown so like. *I'm a legal adult.*

*LIKE?? I MIGHT BE HOMELESS AGAIN? BUT THIS TIME AS AN ADULT? I AM SCARED AS SHIT BC LIKE. Like. It's reality for some but like. I have a good life, man, and I might lose it all?*

I try to compromise. But I guess it isn't good enough. I tried to wear dresses and do exactly what my mom wants me but ended up literally vomiting upon seeing my reflection. Multiple times. Which is why we both agreed to compromise. 

For a while I dressed too bummy, so I started to plan my outfits in advance. Tried to go for a feminine/androgynous sort of style? Occasionally I'll wear eyeshadow or crop tops, because I think I'm beautiful. Just not...complete? Like. If I didn't look like a VSCO girl in feminine shit, I'd wear it *so* much. I try not to live my life like a prequel, but you know what dysphoria is like. 

So none of that is good enough for her. And now I'm in trouble, and fearing for my safety.

My auntie works minimum wage and is trying to support my cousin. Who is also working minimum wage. I can't move in with either of them. They can't support me. My grandma is homophobic and has heart problems, and I don't want to risk making her ill. My oldest cousin lives too far away from my school to be able to commute daily, reliably.

And my dad is just doing everything he can to hurt my mom because he's petty and never wanted a child. That's why he was so angry about paying child support, and now, so angry about supporting me. If I lived with him, my mom (also has heart issues) might fall ill due to stress, and he would continue to harass her in court. I want no part of that bullshit so that's out, too.

Maybe, if push comes to shove, I can help my Granddad take care of my grandma, and move in with them. *Maybe.* 

My therapist says taking her off my FAFSA is a last resort option. Which is also a roll of a die. 

Still, I'm pushing my resume out there, trying to see if any fish nibble. Offering commissions. Even tried to sell feet pictures for a while on Insta, ngl. Y'know? I'm terrified.

And now I'm scared to go home today. Now I'm scared I'm going to be kicked out again. But this time, nobody can help me. I don't know what to do.
