Shy keeps telling me they want to “come out” to the family, and while our mom has a fairly(ish) open mind, the rest of our family... does not. 

I would, however, like to help Shy figure out what they may be and help bring out the person they need to be. Does anyone have any insight, and, I have a baby, but I don’t want to keep referring to Shy is his aunt. What’s the proper pronoun?

2019-01-21 18:05:09,aicru1,1,1,"hey there! i have a ton of questions that i don’t really feel comfortable asking the only openly non-binary person in my life (just for privacy’s sake), so sorry if this is long. 

for maybe the last five years, i’ve been a little confused about my gender. when i was younger i thought a lot about myself in a male body and kind of fantasized about it, but i didn’t really have any dysphoria or urge to be male. with time though i became very uncomfortable in my own body because i gained a bit of weight in my hips and butt, and i was distraught because essentially, my clothes didn’t hang off my body like they did when i had a more masculine one. freshman year of highschool my brother gave me a bunch of his old clothes and i finally started to thrive, realizing i liked them way more than i liked my more revealing or more femme clothes. 

within the last year, i’ve thought a lot about using they/them pronouns. however, i don’t know if its appropriate for me? i’ve heard mixed things about of non-binary folk have to have had dysphoria or not, and i’m not sure if anything i’ve experiences is dysphoria. 

i’m very uncomfortable with my body looking feminine, and prefer clothes that hide the feminine aspects rather than display them. i’ve been very upset by my hair recently (i’m in a modeling contract where i essentially am not allowed to cut my hair), and i’ve been dying to buzz it to experience feeling a little more androgynous. i like my hair but i have had multiple melt downs about how badly i want it to be short. i can comfortably refer to myself as femme or masc, but i seldom call myself a woman. 

my community isn’t a place where i can learn about this stuff. would it be appropriate for me to refer to myself as non-binary? what kind of terms do i need to get used to in referring to myself and other non-binary folk? any advice?

I’m 25, F, and lately I’ve been questioning that. I don’t feel like a M, but I just don’t feel like F is fitting either.
