We can't afford therapy (and he's family, so he isn't charging us.), and due to past experiences, my parents are terrified of discontinuing my therapy sessions. Which is a good thing, because my mom was hesitant prior. I think I'm comfortable sharing everything with him except for dysphoria (and my experiences with weed, haha).

Which is important because I'd like to know what my next steps should be with my transition. I *could* order androgel off Amazon but I doubt that's safe. I could subscribe to Pride Counseling but I'm self employed with inconsistent pay, still pushing my resume onto applications. 

He's known and loved me since I was born, and vice versa. I am terrified of him looking at me differently. Unless ""differently"" is defined as neither a man or a woman, and not an attention seeker, just the same young adult he's been treating for the past year. Because that is exactly what I want. Lol. 

Am I being impatient or impulsive? Because, honestly, I *could* wait till I can afford gender therapy for myself, and then come out to *that* therapist instead. But if I come out to my uncle/current therapist, I could get the support and guidance I need sooner, *and* for free. But the possibility of it all backfiring is there, too, so ? Lmao. 

My mother (bless her heart. I love her and she means well but this was *very* unhealthy) paid for behavioral therapy after I cut my hair (without permission-- I was 14, it was 2AM one morning, I looked in the mirror, and then I said ""Fuck this shit"") and came out. But only so that I could ""be fixed"" as she put it. My uncle has my confidentiality-- and I'm 18-- so that won't happen again. That and he isn't anything-gay-phobic. 

But it's been peaceful between the rest of my family and I, only because I'm closeted and hide my gender affirming paraphenelia. When I was 14 and out, Hell rose. Which is why I went back into the closet. I said that I'd do everything I needed when I am 18 and/or older/ASAP. Now I'm 18. Not self sufficient. Just 18 and legally able to make responsible decisions for myself and those who will be effected. 

I told him I bought my first binder and he asked, ""You're not comfortable with your breasts?"" When I said no he smiled and leaned back. ""Interesting. Okay, my dear!"" And then it was time for me to go. A while ago, I was explaining how I like to present myself for whatever reaaon, but didn't want to straight up say ""androgynous,"" because I was afraid of his reaction. So I said ""I like to dress... Like... Like...""

He finished my sentence with: ""Androgunous?""

""Yes!""

""I already knew that."" He smiled. ""I can see it in you; which likely would explain a lot of your behavior."" 

Like. Is that an older therapist's way of saying that you're setting off their gaydar?  Lol

2019-08-02 19:12:09,cl8hvh,8,7,"so my birth name is owen. I liked the name greatly but still felt a little discomfort with it, just enough for me to want to change it. my name was picked-on a decent amount. I found out the flipping and switching of the letters, and doing my usual thing, told everyone. I had large groups of people that would call me NEMO. I like it at first, but grew old real quick. also, my bestfriends thought it would be funny if they called themselves owen, so walking into a room with 4-6 people all calling themselves by your name, and following you was traumatic for me. (actually still makes me a little tight in the chest).

before I even knew what being non-binary was I started looking at other names, when I was 11-12 and again when I was 14, and again at 16 a little while ago. The name I landed on every time was Alis.

 Alis is what I have recently started going by. but it has started to feel,,, not as comfortable. I don't know if it's just me kinda settling into the thought of that now being my name. I didn't tell just a small group to try it out, I told EVERYONE. it's been easier for some people than others, but to now not know if it is right for me is frightening. I like the name and it suits me well, but I think it might be too feminine. I have another name that I like, but the that thought comes along of 'what if I don't like the next name, or the next'. I don't want to put anyone through anymore than needs to be done. 

something I noticed while writing this is I am very comfortable with the name Alis, and not at other times. The other name I thought of not too long ago is Sila. (yes, that's Alis backwards). it's gender neutral, uncommon, rolls well, comfortable most of the time, I like the spelling. although I think I might like it more as a nickname than my actual name, something that I can be called, but not always.

Hello everyone.

For the entirety of my 29 years I've been Cishet, AMAB, Masuline-presenting. A combination of recent incidents has given me to thinking about my gender identity: 

* Meeting my partner (Cis, Bi, also 29) has in general helped me become a more open-minded and curious person, about myself as well as others. We've been together for two + 1/2 years and the way we make supportive, sensitive discussion a frequent staple of our relationship has really helped.
* I work at a coffee shop and frequently have parents/children referring to me as ""The Man"" (i.e. ""Don't grab that cookie, let the man put it on a plate for you""). I know they're not doing anything maliciously, and especially that I present as masculine, but it still makes me uncomfortable. Something in me says that term doesn't specifically apply to me.
* A frequent customer of ours is a trans\*, male-pronouns teenager, with his mother and grandmother; they run a business together and are the loveliest, and the mum and grandma are very vocally supportive of him. This supportive atmosphere, especially at a vulnerable age, does make me wonder about what I missed growing up.
* With birthdays coming up over this month, I've been thinking more about my estranged family and their role in my development, particularly my (emotionally abusive) parents. Although my parents espoused centre-left politics, they always had a more conservative relationship with gender, trying to push me towards more masculine-associated behaviours and interests and discourage femininity. For example, I was often pushed to try to become more involved in sports, which I find boring; and frequently mocked for anything I wore that might be more ""girly"", not to mention my slender, wide-hipped body-shape. 

After some research, I've found that I most identify with being non-binary/a Demiguy. Many aspects of the traditionally ""masculine"" don't seem to fit with me, and I find myself curious if not excited about exploring my femininity. The other day I tried on a dress for the first time, in private; I immediately got this sense of quiet, yet explosive joy. It felt like I'd been colouring in various shades of red and blue my whole life and only just discovered yellow mixes. I wondered about styling my hair, trying makeup or nail polish.

So I guess I'm spilling onto here (and thank you for reading this far!) because I wonder where I go from here. My co-workers are only so tolerant and probably wouldn't understand my expressing this stuff at work; my ever-supportive partner has suggested I could warm up to looking and acting more feminine within the protective space of our home before trying it in the open world.

Not to mention, I am aware of the LGBTQ+ community out there, and especially that as a Cishet, I have it considerably easier than so many others. I never want anyone else to feel I'm intruding on their space, nor acting as though what I've been through compares to what they go through every day.

I was born female and identify as female. I like feminine things. But I'm starting to realize that I don't really identify as a woman.

I am feminine. I like feminine things. But I also act pretty masculine at times. My absolute favorite moments are when I'm treated like ""one of the guys."" But then again, is this just me realizing that gender is bullshit? What does it mean to even act masculine or feminine?

I'm sorry if this doesn't fit here or if this is just me, as a cis woman, realizing that gender doesn't really matter but it feels more significant I guess? Like, I hate almost everything about me being identified as a woman. I feel like my body is just a body that happens to be female.

2019-08-27 14:16:53,cw52n7,8,3,"Hey there! First of all, I want to apologize for the long post ahead. I really need to vent about this, and I don't know where else to talk about this other than here. For context, I was born with a female body, and I identify as non binary. I suffer from dysphoria, especially when it comes to my height, voice and chest. I'd dream of going on T or undergoing top surgery, but considering that I'm still mostly in the closet and that my parents are not the most progressive people in the world, I don't think I can ever do those things. To mitigate my dysphoria, I'd often change into a binder when I'm out of the house and change back into a normal sports bra so that my parents don't question anything.  


So to the topic at hand, I have a friend. Firstly, he's not a bad person. In fact, I really treasure our friendship! He's very caring and open minded, and as far as I'm concerned, he's not enbyphobic. In fact, he's part of the LGBT community and is one of the most progressive people I know. (The country I live in isn't the most progressive. In fact, gay sex is actually illegal here.) I came out to some of my friends as non binary, but I never did explicitly tell them to use they/them pronouns on me, so everyone still uses she/her pronouns on me. Though it makes me a little uncomfortable, I'm fine with it, since they don't make a big deal about it.   


This friend of mine does a lot of things that irk me a little bit, one of which is making jokes that go way too far, but I'll focus on the non binary jokes that he makes. I do talk to him about my dysphoria a little bit, and he knows that I want to present in a more masculine manner. The jokes that he makes, not just the one about my non binary identity, have been piling up in my head over the past year, and I really want him to stop. He's not a bad person, but sometimes, he can be quite insensitive.  


His jokes would often include him going out of his way to misgender me. Using she/her pronouns on me, that's fine. But he knows that I dislike being called female terms. Despite this, he still calls me 'lady' in a very joking tone. I'm not talking about the word 'lady' being casually dropped in sentences. I'm talking about him saying ""Lady."" in that tone. Not the worst, of course. One other joke that he makes often is about my chest. I have C cups, and they make me extremely uncomfortable. He knows that, and I often wear my binder around him. Yet, he goes out of his way to say, ""You have big, beautiful boobies!"" and other things to poke fun at my chest. It makes me very uncomfortable and insecure. These are just a few jokes that he makes, and he does make a lot more jokes that don't revolve around my identity but still make me very uncomfortable. I told him about my past of being molested a lot as a child, and he made jokes about that.   


I've endured it all for so long. Sure, not the worst, and I know that he has no ill intentions, but still. Today, he said something that he has said quite a few times, but today, it hit hard. My dysphoria has been worsening a while now, and I didn't tell him this, so I sorta justify what he said in my head. I don't remember the conversation leading up to what he said, but he said, and I quote, **""You'll never be a real boy.""** That struck deep. I'm non binary, yes, but I've tried as hard as I could to present myself more as a male, which is hard when you're in the closet and your parents want you to be a stereotypical girl. Hell, these jokes make me regret coming out to my friends. He's not a bad friend, yes, I know, but the jokes he make? Absolutely abhorrent. Okay maybe not abhorrent. Bad. Yeah.  


I want to tell him to stop, but hey, I tried doing it once when he joked about a situation I was in, and he refused. He stopped eventually when I got out of the situation and stopped talking about it. Also, part of me feels like I should just keep enduring it, and not be a 'fragile special snowflake' who's too sensitive to take a few jokes. What should I do, y'all? Also, if you made it this far, thank you for reading! ;; This is my first time on the subreddit.

In fact, he\'s part of the LGBT community and is one of the most progressive people I know. (The country I live in isn\'t the most progressive. In fact, gay sex is actually illegal here.) I came out to some of my friends as non binary, but I never did explicitly tell them to use they/them pronouns on me, so everyone still uses she/her pronouns on me. Though it makes me a little uncomfortable, I\'m fine with it, since they don\'t make a big deal about it.   \n\n\nThis friend of mine does a lot of things that irk me a little bit, one of which is making jokes that go way too far, but I\'ll focus on the non binary jokes that he makes. I do talk to him about my dysphoria a little bit, and he knows that I want to present in a more masculine manner. The jokes that he makes, not just the one about my non binary identity, have been piling up in my head over the past year, and I really want him to stop. He\'s not a bad person, but sometimes, he can be quite insensitive.  \n\n\nHis jokes would often include him going out of his way to misgender me. Using she/her pronouns on me, that\'s fine. But he knows that I dislike being called female terms. Despite this, he still calls me \'lady\' in a very joking tone. I\'m not talking about the word \'lady\' being casually dropped in sentences. I\'m talking about him saying ""Lady."" in that tone. Not the worst, of course. One other joke that he makes often is about my chest. I have C cups, and they make me extremely uncomfortable. He knows that, and I often wear my binder around him. Yet, he goes out of his way to say, ""You have big, beautiful boobies!"" and other things to poke fun at my chest. It makes me very uncomfortable and insecure. These are just a few jokes that he makes, and he does make a lot more jokes that don\'t revolve around my identity but still make me very uncomfortable. I told him about my past of being molested a lot as a child, and he made jokes about that.   \n\n\nI\'ve endured it all for so long. Sure, not the worst, and I know that he has no ill intentions, but still. Today, he said something that he has said quite a few times, but today, it hit hard. My dysphoria has been worsening a while now, and I didn\'t tell him this, so I sorta justify what he said in my head. I don\'t remember the conversation leading up to what he said, but he said, and I quote, **""You\'ll never be a real boy.""** That struck deep. I\'m non binary, yes, but I\'ve tried as hard as I could to present myself more as a male, which is hard when you\'re in the closet and your parents want you to be a stereotypical girl. Hell, these jokes make me regret coming out to my friends. He\'s not a bad friend, yes, I know, but the jokes he make? Absolutely abhorrent. Okay maybe not abhorrent. Bad. Yeah.  \n\n\nI want to tell him to stop, but hey, I tried doing it once when he joked about a situation I was in, and he refused. He stopped eventually when I got out of the situation and stopped talking about it. Also, part of me feels like I should just keep enduring it, and not be a \'fragile special snowflake\' who\'s too sensitive to take a few jokes. What should I do, y\'all? Also, if you made it this far, thank you for reading! ;; This is my first time on the subreddit.  \n\n\n(TLDR: My friend misgenders me as a joke and pokes fun at my dysphoria way too much)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': '[TW(?): Misgendering + Dysphoria] My friend pokes fun of my identity and it makes me extremely uncomfortable.', 'created': 1566940613.0}"
