My boyfriend (31/AMAB, cis) and I (25/AMAB, NB) have been together for about 9 months, and very happy. Except for one mainly unspoken issue: my presentation. I'm not super flamboyant; I'd consider my aesthetic to be ""butch andro professor,"" and most people would guess I'm a cis gay guy. But it's his first same-sex relationship and being out with me dressing masc was challenging enough. Also, unlike myself, who is pan, he is gay - and made a point that he is *just* gay. He made a point that he's attracted to *men*. (This was both terrifying and validating - he doesn't view me as a man, which makes me happy, but this means he's less attracted to me). I've been pretty cis-presenting around him, but it's starting to catch up with me... I feel it affecting me. In every other regard, I'm so happy in this relationship, and I don't know what to do :( especially because he's been very supportive in some ways. I don't feel like I should be ending the relationship over this, but I also feel like I need to be able to be a little more out.

2019-12-03 07:05:26,e5dbky,2,1,"So, I’m new here. Hi, I’m an 18yo afab and I’ve just recently started to question my gender. I know that I definitely don’t identify as a guy, but I don’t think that I completely identify as a girl either. Let me see if I can get some good context in here (tl;dr at end):

When I was younger I was considered to be somewhat of a tomboy. I certainly wasn’t the most tomboyish person ever, but I wasn’t all too interested in girly stuff, either. And I know that interests don’t really have much to do with gender, but stick with me here. When I got a bit older, I remember that I felt a kind of pride with the tomboy label and was starting to wonder if I wasn’t one anymore, so I asked one of my friends about it, and we chatted. I also use to hate wearing skirts; they were much less practical than plain old pants in my opinion, and I was just a tad bit jealous that guys could wear suits and I couldn’t. I also went through a tomboy phase in middle school; I would love wearing any baggy jeans, sneakers, and t-shirts that I could find in the girls’ section (because heaven *forbid* I enter the men’s section and be seen as strange. I still can’t make myself go near it without a sense of discomfort). I didn’t care too much about what I did with my hair, despite how long it was at the time. Either I would just straighten it or do nothing at all. I had horrible split ends and was a bit sad that I couldn’t grow my hair super long because of it (kinda like a “I wanna see how long I can grow my hair” type of thing more than anything). But then in my early years of high school I began to consider a shorter haircut, like an A-line. The thought of it excited me, but I was scared of letting go of all the length of hair I had acquired over the years (which wasn’t growing very fast, mind you). Eventually I did get my hair cut and it was like the best thing since sliced bread. My hair became so much more manageable and healthier. Over time I would get my hair cut even shorter, but never above my chin (I feel a bit self-conscious about the roundness of my face, which my hair covers up). I’ve even had it bleached for a sort of ombré sort of look and dyed since then.

Fast forward a while; my views on dresses and skirts have definitely changed. I have no problem dressing with them (as long as I don’t have to wear leggings; those things have always been a *nightmare*), but I’ve also discovered that dressing a bit more androgynously has become a part of my style, too. For years I’ve wanted to wear a fedora (as cringey as that might potentially sound) like how one of my classmates used to in grade school and things like vests and dress pants, which I’ve tried to do in the past, but since I only have girls’ clothes it’s just not the same. I do have a couple of hats now; neither of them are fedoras, but they still make me happy. I’ve noticed that my shoulders are possibly just a bit wider than my hips, which I think is really cool. I’ve never had any real problems with my body image, except maybe wanting to be slightly more muscular so I don’t look quite as soft as I do now. I’m not overweight, mind you; I’m actually somewhat underweight (probably because I need more muscle pounds, lol). I’ve also never understood why girls in general seem to be so obsessed over having big chests and round butts. My older sister told me once a few years ago that her friends have complimented the shape of my butt, which I thought was just weird. I find flat butts to be more aesthetically pleasing imo. I’m also glad that my chest isn’t big; I don’t know what I would do if my chest were much bigger. I’ve recently started wondering what it would be like to bind from time to time; it would probably make wearing androgynous stuff like vests and suits feel that much better to me. My Halloween costumes throughout the years I don’t think have ever been explicitly girly, and my more recent ones have had a tendency to be more androgynous, despite still being for girls. Stuff like a pirate, a steampunk person (that outfit had a vest which made me so freaking happy), and a ringmaster (that had a vest AND a long red coat with *shoulder pads*, which had me ecstatic). Now that I think of it, when I was younger and made a diy pirate costume, I based it off of Captain Jack Sparrow.

Now, only a few days ago did I actually start to question whether or not I might not really be a cis girl. At first I felt ridiculous for even questioning it in the first place, because I’ve never felt body dysphoria in my life. But the thought that sparked my curiosity was how I find the word “woman” to be so strange. Like, I thought that that label would be something that I would eventually identify with when I grew up, but now that I’m in college and turning 19 next week, I’m not so sure. Older people, especially people in my family, like to compliment me as “becoming a beautiful young lady/woman” and I’ve always just gone with it because I’m used to it. I don’t mind being called “pretty” or “beautiful” (as long as that’s how I’m trying to present. I’ve sometimes found myself frustrated when I would be called “cute” rather than “handsome” when I’m wearing something that I don’t mean to be “cute”, idk), but lady and woman don’t sit quite right with me. She and her pronouns have also never bothered me, and I’m not sure whether or not I would want to use they/them pronouns or not yet. I’ve just been questioning everything lately and I relatively recently discovered that I’m on both the ace and aro spectrums, so I guess gender naturally comes next, lol.

TL;DR: I’m wondering if maybe I’m somewhere on the non-binary spectrum and I think there might have been subtle signs that I am throughout my life.

2019-12-04 03:46:28,e5taa1,3,1,"Usually I post to rant. This is gonna be the same type of thing. Sorry...

I feel like I've figured myself out multiple times. A while ago I thought I was just bi. I always felt like I was lying to myself. Like I was doing it to gain attention. I only came out as bi to about three people until I decided that I was taking it, and I was being stupid. I then thought I was ace for a while, which make no sense as I had sexual feelings. Then I thought I might be aro. That stuck for a while. I thought about it through a relationship even, which was not my best or brightest moment. I felt nothing towards her for the longest time, and we broke up quickly. After that relationship, I felt more lost. Nobody had interest in me, and I had no interest in others, romantically speaking.

2019-12-04 20:31:24,e65cvq,2,1,"I have recently found out I’m non-binary and gendeflux; which is just basically fluctuating between two genders. And in my case, I fluctuate between non-binary and demi-female. I rather go by they/them pronouns because it’s easier for people and myself and I feel comfortable with it. I also have found a name I like and want to go by, which only a few people know about. But my teachers, parents, family, and outside friends don’t know, so they deadname me without knowing, which sucks, but it’s not their fault, I just don’t have the confidence or courage (yet) to tell my family and my school. 

                               ~Why I think this ~

When I was younger I never felt quite feminine or masculine. I liked playing with both gendered toys, dressing up in both gendered clothing, and hanging out with both genders. I always felt like I had to play with certain things or wear certain colors because I was a cis-female, but over time I decided to do whatever I want. Then, when puberty came, I started to notice how different I was compared to all the other cis-females around me. They always talked about their breasts and their cup sizes. But, my breasts were the one thing I hated the most. Most cis-females or women would talk about how they wished they had bigger breasts or smaller ones, but I never heard them say “I wish I never had them”. It’s awkward to heard how some females can be so open about their bodies, only because I can’t relate. I’m the only one not talking about it, and once they all realize, they start asking me questions like “Whats your cup size?”, “Do you shop at Victoria Secret?”. 1.) I do not know my cup size and I don’t have a desire to find out. 2.) No I do not shop at Victoria Secret because they do not sell sports bras. I use to think I was just a tomboy, someone who would rather do more “boy-like” things. But then there were the days I felt like getting dressed up in all feminine clothing. Then there were days when I dressed in a hoodie, leggings, and a beanie and I would be asked if I was a boy. Clearly, I realized, I hated being asked if I was a boy. So I new I wasn’t a trans FTM soon enough. But this feeling of uncertainty followed me through elementary school and to middle school. I had put aside my uncomfortable feelings—later to find out it was dyscorphia—to focus on school. 

This year I got to read a book called “I Wish You All the Best” by Mason Deaver (I recommend it) and it opened my eyes to something I didn’t know about: non-binary. I did a lot of research, and through this discovery, I met someone who identifies with being a non-binary, trans, genderflux person too. And they’ve been super helpful and their the reason why I have finally figured myself out. 

Two days ago I came out to my mom. I emailed her articles regarding being non-binary and what it is, including the definition of being genderflux. I’ve been waiting anxiously for her to talk to me, to ask me questions. But so far, nothing. I’m waiting patiently, as patiently as I can. I’ve been worrying all week if I did the wrong thing or if I did the right thing. My anxiety has been through the roof, and I don’t know if it’s natural to feel this way. I was hoping last year, when I came out as bisexual, that that would be the only time I would come out, but I guess not. 

All I have ever wanted was to be my most authentic self. And I feel like I am slowly becoming the person I hoped I’d become.

I'm a sophomore in college, and I live in an apartment about two hours away from my mom's house. after ten years of renting, she has finally decided to buy a house. we're really happy to be moving out of our little townhouse, but there's a big problem. we're closing on the house in about a week, and nothing is packed. to make matters worse, we have just a bit of a hoarding problem. we've had to rent a storage unit for all of our useless junk, and fill baskets with clothes that we never wear anymore. so on friday, I decided to drive to my mom's house and stay the weekend to help her pack. I decided the first place I needed to start was my bedroom, specifically my clothes. 

the problem is that I haven't really thrown away any clothes in about 5 years, so I still have tons of clothes from middle and high school. back then, I used to present feminine because, well, I didn't know any better. you guys get it. but now I'm transmasculine. I'm pre-everything, but I pretty much only wear boyish clothes these days. I've only worn a dress twice in the past year, and I hated it so much.

so that's the thing. I have tons of dresses and bras and skirts and things that I don't want anymore. but I'm terrified to get rid of them. it's almost like once they're gone, the person I was back then is gone forever. I don't know why it scares me so much. I guess I just have a hard time letting go.

anyway, I wanted to come here and post this to see if anyone has had similar experiences with getting rid of old clothes. is it scary for you? is it therapeutic? how do you feel now?

I'm close to it, I wanted and waited for it for so long, but since I said to her that the time finally arrived, I'm doubting to do it.
When I said I would cut, she started to cry her eyes out, said that she don't remember saying it and gave me some looks, judging looks, and made me feel bad about it. She has all my life being a control freak and treating me as her doll, and, I can't fight against this feelings that she makes me feel.
I wanted to cut my hair short, really short. I've thinking about buzz cut, pixie cut or faux hawk for a long time, but I'm not sure about do it anymore, but I don't know if it's because of her or because of me.
I hate my long hair, I've been trying to short it little by little but I can't like it, I only feel comfortable when it's with a ponytail, haps or hoodies.
I think that if I cut she will judge me everyday even more than she already does.

2019-12-13 23:13:34,eablx9,0,1,"I was randomly thinking about gender expression and about the fact that although we don't follow the binaries of gender presentation, most of us still looking for a expression that it's kind of closer to the gender opposite to the gender that we were assigned at birth. 

I don't know you guys, but I was raised in a family with very stereotyped mind about boys and girls and kind of early created a intense hate about the presentation of my AGAT and I wanted to be as closer as the other gender as I could, because I didn't felt that my supposed correct presentation was the right for the person I trully was.

I realized that I may hadn't experienced too much dysphoria when it comes to presentation if my parents and other people that I lived with weren't too stereotyped mind. May If the girls had short and long hair and the boys dressed shorts and skirts, I would think I belong there, and maybe I would be happy with my AGAB.

While thinking more and more about the topic, I made some a theory about a distant future, and want to share with you guys.

People in this days where more and more people come out as non binary are often saying that in a close future gender may not exist anymore, but, I don't actually think that it is what will happen.

Imagine if we, the people who fights against the binary rules, be the ones who create a generation of childrens that doesn't have stereotypes in their minds. They'll still getting it from the worlds that still very binary, so of course this ""non-binary epidemia"" wouldn't happen in the close, but in every knew generations, those gender stereotypes will be more and more broken by those person that are raised in a free minded family.

I think that instead of ""transforming"" everyone in non-binary people, it would actually causes less dysphoria and more people that assign themselves with their genitals' gender, because, if the stereotypes of gender don't exist, more and more people would be free to present how they want to, being it what is today related ""feminine"" or ""masculine"", they wouldn't feel intimitade my those rules, because it doesn't exist. So, because of it, I don't think we will ever be able to break all the binary sistem, but we will change it for the better, being cis or trans, people will just be themselves.

Snd that's why I don't think that the future will be non-binary, it will be just freedom.

New here, I'm a 25 year old female.  But for as long as I can remember I've felt like I was supposed to have a penis.  Nothing else male, just the penis.  I love my boobs, I love dresses, long hair, curves all of it.  The only part of my body that doesn't match is my vagina.

I can't masturbate unless I use a wand, don't enjoy oral sex being performed on me, hate looking at my vagina in the mirror. And the moment I had a boyfriend I wanted to know everything about what it felt like to actually have a penis.

A few years ago I bought a penis looking stand to pee device and I was in heaven everytime I used it, however it's not perfect and often makes a mess so I had to stop using it.

I don't know what this all means tho. I know I don't want to live as male but if I could id get a penis in a heart beat.  

I don't know what to do about all of this?

2019-12-24 01:41:33,eeu66x,4,1,"I [21, AFAB] used be skeptical about non-binary identities but deep down I knew I did not align with my sex and I knew the label could possibly fit me. The past couple years I educated myself and now I know I was wrong and now I’m listening to that voice that lurked in my brain that said “you know that could be you, right?” I’m not sure if I’m non-binary. I feel like my experiences are different from a typical female’s but also I dont think I have dysphoria. I’m very active in then LGBT community (I’m a lesbian) and I’m worried I’m just getting too involved and tricking myself into thinking I’m non-binary??? So I’m just going to list some things and I would like to know if it sounds like typical gender dysphoria.

I have a love hate relationship with my breasts. When I started growing them I was in denial. I would never wear a bra, and when I started wearing one they were always sports bras. When I grew older, though, I wore push-up bras and I felt a little more confident in my breasts. I mainly wore them when dressing masculine because I didn’t want to look male. I still felt uncomfortable going braless (even in private) and I hated taking off my bra in front of partners and I still can’t figure out why. Then this year I randomly decided I wanted to go back to sports bras. And then I bought a binder to test to see if it worked for me. I hate not wearing it because I’m with my parents for break and they’ll notice. I feel better now that I have one and I’m happy I look more androgynous. But I don’t know if what I experienced was chest dysphoria because there were times where I was ok and even possibly happy with my breasts???

I am ok with my genitals but at the same time I really wish I had a penis. I don’t know why. I’ve always wanted one, since I was a child. There was a time that penis talk would make me incredibly depressed because I didn’t have one. I used to think “I was only one chromosome away from having that”. But if I had the option, I don’t think I would consider getting one because then it would basically be a full sex change and I also feel pretty content about my current...uh, set. If only there were retractable penises... It’s confusing for me.

PERIODS. They give me mental breakdowns and I am on birth control to end them. My dream is to one day get my uterus removed but I know no doctor will do that for me without a medical reason. I think that this might not be dysphoria though because I have a bleeding disorder. But even with the birth control making them lighter I still feel disconnected from my body.

Ever since I started dressing more masculine/androgynous I’ve been happier. I smile like an idiot looking at myself in the mirror wearing a mens button up. I haven’t been this happy since my tomboy phase. My mom made me stop wearing boys clothes when I entered middle school and I just felt so uncomfortable. I would wear the most androgynous women’s clothing I could find. When I’m wearing women’s clothing I feel like every nook and cranny of my body is on display and I feel like a stranger. I don’t even LOOK like I belong in women’s clothing when I look at myself in the mirror. Any time I present feminine I look like a stranger in the mirror.

I’ve never felt 100% like a girl. There were times when I reminded myself I’m a girl and I’d be like “oh my god I am one, aren’t I?” Any video game I would play, I would always play as a guy as well.

So that’s all. I’m experimenting with the label. This account is my alter ego basically so I can see if I feel more comfortable using my favorite name and using they/them pronouns.

2019-12-26 00:38:39,efoa9b,4,1,"We had family Christmas at my grandparents, and we have quite a small family. I had been suspecting for a while that my 13yo cousin might be questioning gender and/or sexuality, and this was all but confirmed after some less than savoury comments from their mother.

So I went inside and waited for them to come upstairs. Everybody else was out on the balcony so I called them over and sat them down and casually said that I heard they'd been questioning some things. 

My cousin immediately withdrew and started looking around embarrassed. I quickly backtracked to let them know that I identified as non-binary and bisexual (the first time I had come out to a family member other than immediate family because my sister had been a complete bitch when I'd come out to her and she's one of the better ones). Almost instantly my cousin looked so relieved and started spouting everything that was on their mind. They came out to me as trans.

Guys, I feel so sorry for them. They have some support at school with their friends and they've been talking to people on phone helplines and Reddit about what they're going through. But their mum is less than thrilled about it and thinks it's just a 'tomboy phase'. They asked how I figured out I was NB and I told them and they related to that as well. 

We ended the conversation with a hug. I told them I was really proud of them and that they could text me about whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted. I also said that because they weren't out to the family, I would keep using female pronouns (though tried to avoid using pronouns at all for the rest of the day, usually using their name instead) but to let me know when they wanted that to change. 

I feel maybe I shouldn't have cornered them, but I just really wanted them to know that, especially within their family, they were not alone, it was completely fine and that they had at least some support and someone who knew a bit about what they were going through.

This is going to mild rantish so apologies.

I am a freshman in college out of state so I got a lot of cash for the holiday this year including gift cards which has me excited because I can finally get a chest binder and not have it show in the bank records my parents can see.

I'm AFAB Nonbinary leaning towards the transmasc side of the spectrum and though I've brought up being Nonbinary before I'm not really out out. 

While I was really excited I got to my room and sat down and started getting really anxious that if I started wearing a binder I would have to come out. I had a hand me down binder from a friend that sparked a conversation that went poorly and I haven't seen that in months after that conversation.

It's just freaking frustrating because I should be excited I can finally go and get a binder and ease into my transition but I don't want things to go to all hell when I come out. I'm afraid once I take strides to being who I am that the deadnaming and misgendering will be all too real and I won't know what to do. 

Any time I bring up gender it doesn't go too well and my family says they're supported if LGBT folks but they don't see Nonbinary people and I just... Ugh... It's exhausting.

I hate being in my own house and having my family tell me I'm a disgrace and how my generation is terrible. Without them even knowing. 

I have never felt comfortable with my genitalia. I have always viewed myself as having both or none. I have never felt comfortable with the idea of having one or the other. Recently its gotten so bad that I don't keep up with proper hygiene because i don't want to look at how feminine my body is. I wish my jaw line was more prominent. I wish my chest were flatter. There are so many things.

 I just. I struggle so much with telling anyone about it. When i was finailly admitting to myself that maybe I wasn't a girl, and I confessed to someone about it. He told me that he only believed there were males and females and that while he will always support me he didn't think that I should tell anyone else and that I was probably just confused. It hurt so much. But I understood so i tried to contain it all. Along with everything else I bottled up at the time. Eventually I told my mom how I viewed myself. I tried to explain that I didn't see myself in sexual acts or in non sexual acts with my parts. I tried so much to explain how I felt and hoped she would accept me. She looked at me and said that I basically wanted to fuck dudes with a strap on. And that's about when I didn't say anything for anyone for two years. Eventually. Last year. I felt like i found people who would believe me and accept me. I met someone who was non binary and someone who was trans and a whole bunch of people who did love me and i was really close with (a lot of said people were lost friendships that ended up rejoining because its highschool) I actually came out to people about it last year. And the small amount actually did accept me! They still used she hers but I figured since I didn't come out about it to anyone else that it was understandable.

And then I met someone really special. I had recently(at the time) broken up from a toxic relationship with someone who really drilled in that I was ""a girl who would never have a dick so why act like it."" The guy I met was and is absolutely amazing. He calls me by they all of the time. And always refers to me as his partner. I finally felt like someone accepted me. And then with this relationship I have. It slowly built up my self confidence and worth. And I told other people. Half would be very they/them and then some would struggle but always correct(I am not saying these people are worse than people who use they them without a second thought)and then there's people who say I'm ""too feminine"" or that I'll always ""be a girl"" to them or that ""they them is more comfortable for me to use with trans people sometimes"" but have them mock me for asking to be refered to as they them. Despite using it for other non binary people.

I finally have talked about how i feel in detail with a non binary/trans guy and I feel really valid? Affirmed?

They/he told me that I had disphoria and gender euphoria and that I was real. And it was completely normal for me to feel like that.

But. Being non binary is scary. Is terrifying. Knowing that I'll always be a woman or a girl in a ton of situations is scary. There will be very little opportunity for me to mark down my gender as non binary. Society wont  recognize me as trans. It sees me as worse because it denys me of existing.

I've been seriously questioning my gender for the past 4ish months. I present completely female right now and I've identified as a cis lesbian for the past four years. However, I've always felt subconsciously not right, never fit in with other girls, and had lots of past experiences that I now see as suspiciously eggy. Where I stand now, I don't even know if I'm cis or not yet.

My feelings really do strongly and wildly fluctuate. Here's my breakdown:

* 40% of days: I'm completely fine presenting as female, though I've never been particularly feminine.
* 30% of days: In-between days where I'm not sure but I don't feel completely right as a girl.
* 30% of days: I get so happy when I bind and dress masc. On those days, I'd like more than anything to be out as a boy or enby. I want so badly to be Jack, he/him or they/them, instead of Daisy\* and she/her.
* *\*birth name changed for privacy*

I don't want to self-diagnose but I think I sometimes experience dysphoria on my most masculine days- mostly social, some physical. However, there are some days when I feel fine how I am and wouldn't change it. When I'm feeling cis, I'm really good at straight-up denying that I've ever felt anything non-cis. Finally, there are the days that confuse me the most. These are the days when- even though I'm feeling just fine being cis- I still get so happy when I bind/dress masc. On these days, after I take everything off and go back to presenting female, I miss presenting masc but I'm completely okay going back to female.

Now to throw another wrench in:

I know I only like girls. The thing is, whenever I think of being with a girl, I always think of our relationship dynamic being queer. I feel more feminine when I think of myself in a relationship with a girl. Even when I'm at my most masc, I'd never want to be the masculine figure in a relationship.

I really don't know what I want, and I've chased myself in circles questioning. Can anyone help me make sense of my own feelings?

They cheered with friends, both cisgender and trans, when they found their name
They smiled when they were called by their real name
They grinned when they cross-dressed for the first time
They were delighted when the liked their look in the mirror, with a flat chest
They can’t wait for the day they can legally change their name
They are ecstatic for when they can start taking testosterone
They are anticipating the day they finally pass as non-binary
They can’t wait until the world knows the name Arrow Castiel.

They are me

I never saw the point in gender, because people are all the same
I never got why people dressed as certain stereotypes, because someone else’s ideals shouldn’t define how we look
I don’t understand why people bully transgender people, they’re human and deserve our respect
I beamed when I discovered my gender identity, I finally found me
I cheered with my closest friends, three of which are also trans, when I found my new name, well, when it found me
I smiled when people called me by my new name for the first time, I felt accepted and overjoyed
I grinned when I dressed in boy clothes for the first time, I loved dressing like myself for the first time
I was delighted when I wore my first ‘binder’ and I had a flat chest (ish)
I can’t wait until I can change my name, when I can finally start being me
I am ecstatically waiting until I can start testosterone, I can stop having female part of me that I really don’t like
I am anticipating the day I finally pass as non-binary, when I finally look how I want
I can’t wait for my world to know my name, Arrow Castiel.

I am me.

They are me.

I am them.

I'm 15 and I've been questioning this for a few months now. I've been familiar with the LGBTQ+ community for as long as I remember, and also identified as pansexual ever since I learned what that meant. Recently I started reading more about non binary identities and started to question myself. 

Having short hair like the boys from my school was my dream for about 5 years (I have it now) and I overall always prefered the things that my girl friends told me were ""guy things"", but I know that doesn't necessarily means I'm not a girl. Plus I do think that might be due to some other factors. I had a ""not like the other girls"" fase about 6 years ago where I actively tried doing stuff that guys liked to do. A lot of them which I didn't even like but did anyways

The motive I started thinking seriously about this is that a couple months ago I was walking with a friend of mine holding hands and she started giggling. Apparently a friend of hers was drawing hearts on the air cuz she thought I was her boyfriend. I didn't think much of that at the time but it felt really cool and I got excited. Another thing is that I always felt uncomfortable with my developing body. There was a time I felt repulsed by it, but again, that could be anxiety about being seen as attractive by others. (That always scared me)

I did think I might be transgender but I don't really see myself as a boy. It also feels kinda weird being called a girl, but it feels less weird than being called a boy. Does that mean anything? Both feel like an exaggeration if that makes sense.

I was pretty much set on what I was, but reading about how to know if you're non binary or not almost all articles say something like ""you might be non binary if you feel uncomfortable with both male and female pronouns or being treated like a man or a woman"" but I don't really feel uncomfortable being called a girl. It's just kinda funny. And I do actually like being called a boy but I don't feel like one. Gender neutral pronouns seen perfect but do I still count as non binary?

2019-12-30 00:38:55,ehecci,2,1,"Lately I’ve felt very confused about what I want from myself, and how I want others to perceive me. I ID as a (afab) female/woman and a lesbian, and don’t feel like any other labels fit me as accurately as those. I don’t feel attachment to calling myself nonbinary, trans, transmasculine, etc. I use she/her pronouns. I feel like if I preferred a different set, I would have known by now, because I have been through the gamut with how I’ve been gendered (he/him, they/them, she/her, sometimes in a single day). The only times I genuinely liked being called he/him was when I was in an unsafe/homophobic environment. They/them pronouns make me feel dehumanized, but I know the majority of people don’t feel that way. 

I guess I could be classified as butch. I wear pretty much all men’s clothing, and prefer my hair short, my face clean and plain, and would prefer a more muscular/masculine body (gonna join Planet Fitness when it opens up near me in January!). However, I seem to go through waves of what I can only describe as gender dysphoria. I sometimes want to rip my hair out whenever I get dysphoric, because I conceptually know masculine lesbians certainly aren’t exempt from experiencing it, but I feel like my life would be so much simpler if I could just comfortably be a lesbian, or comfortably call myself a trans guy. 

I have been researching the ways in which nonbinary people take steps towards transitioning, and am interested in taking certain medical steps towards masculinizing myself. Namely, I want to try taking T along with finasteride, a DHT blocker. The finasteride would significantly lessen or completely block facial and body hair growth, along with bottom growth and a sharp voice drop. However, muscle growth and body fat redistribution would not be lessened too much. Other than my body proportions, I don’t feel dysphoric about my chest or genitals, so I don’t think I’d want to pursue surgeries. 

But sometimes I find myself wanting the whole package. I self-harm by finding cis men on Instagram who have similar features to me, and comparing myself against them. Why don’t I grow facial hair? Why don’t I get attention from straight women? I guess some of this could be chalked up to internalized homophobia, but I hate living like this. One day I’ll jealously look at my younger brother sprouting a beard (didn’t help that he told me I should try and grow one too as a shitty joke earlier today), but then I find myself totally turned off by these features the next day. 

I guess if I had magical powers, I’d be a woman with a face and body almost identical to those of cis men, sans the genitals and lack of breast growth (good place to mention I’m fairly flat chested and prefer it that way). I’d also be interested in sometimes growing facial hair, but would still want to be referred to as she/her and seen as a lesbian. However, I’d want the ability to get rid of the facial hair at will, without traces of stubble (or have to shave it every few days). Obviously, I know I can’t have both.

I wear pretty much all men’s clothing, and prefer my hair short, my face clean and plain, and would prefer a more muscular/masculine body (gonna join Planet Fitness when it opens up near me in January!). However, I seem to go through waves of what I can only describe as gender dysphoria. I sometimes want to rip my hair out whenever I get dysphoric, because I conceptually know masculine lesbians certainly aren’t exempt from experiencing it, but I feel like my life would be so much simpler if I could just comfortably be a lesbian, or comfortably call myself a trans guy. \n\nI have been researching the ways in which nonbinary people take steps towards transitioning, and am interested in taking certain medical steps towards masculinizing myself. Namely, I want to try taking T along with finasteride, a DHT blocker. The finasteride would significantly lessen or completely block facial and body hair growth, along with bottom growth and a sharp voice drop. However, muscle growth and body fat redistribution would not be lessened too much. Other than my body proportions, I don’t feel dysphoric about my chest or genitals, so I don’t think I’d want to pursue surgeries. \n\nBut sometimes I find myself wanting the whole package. I self-harm by finding cis men on Instagram who have similar features to me, and comparing myself against them. Why don’t I grow facial hair? Why don’t I get attention from straight women? I guess some of this could be chalked up to internalized homophobia, but I hate living like this. One day I’ll jealously look at my younger brother sprouting a beard (didn’t help that he told me I should try and grow one too as a shitty joke earlier today), but then I find myself totally turned off by these features the next day. \n\nI guess if I had magical powers, I’d be a woman with a face and body almost identical to those of cis men, sans the genitals and lack of breast growth (good place to mention I’m fairly flat chested and prefer it that way). I’d also be interested in sometimes growing facial hair, but would still want to be referred to as she/her and seen as a lesbian. However, I’d want the ability to get rid of the facial hair at will, without traces of stubble (or have to shave it every few days). Obviously, I know I can’t have both. \n\nI guess I’m looking for…advice? Support? Anybody who can relate? I feel so out of place and so not normal.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Not sure why I feel this way.', 'created': 1577691535.0}"
