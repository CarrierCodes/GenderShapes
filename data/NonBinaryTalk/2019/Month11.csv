sometimes i see people stating ""gender is just personality"" (implying that there are 2 genders and all gender variations are just personality traits, not their own genders).

i can't stop myself from questioning my identity every time some cis-normative person says this. am i just internally transphobic? usually i see gender as part of the personality, since you can't divorce someone's gender from their personality, but i can't see why gender IS personality. but in the back of my mind i'm scared that i'm wrong and they're right.

I have just recently come to accept the fact that I am nonbinary, and I'm still a little shaken up about it considering the fact I've grown up in a homophobic family, and it was hard enough for me to accept the fact I liked girls. But, besides that, I need some help. A lot honestly. And I have a couple questions.

I have a large chest, and I'm not out to anybody yet so I cant buy a real binder. How else could I bind or at least hide my chest a little. I genuinely hate waking up every morning and getting dressed and seeing my chest, and I hate seeing it in shirts. So binding would really help.

How do I come out? Theres only one person I want to come out to, my sister in law. She helped me a lot and was supportive when I told her I liked girls, considering shes bi. She supported me, but now I'm not sure how to come out as nonbinary. Obviously I'm going to wait a bit, but how do I tell her when the time is right?

How do I cover up my feminine features? I know baggy clothes are an option, but is there any other way? I know this one is a dumb question, but I want to know.

How do I try and comfort myself or feel comfortable on days where I feel feminine, where  I want to rip off my chest and get rid of my curves and feminine face, and I just feel horrible all around?

And lately I‚Äôve just been switching between these to terms. Lately though, as in the past 5 months I‚Äôve been occasionally questioning my gender.

It has only happened a couple of times, and it‚Äôs always been about whether I‚Äôm nonbinary or cis (I‚Äôm biologically female).

I saw people on here say that as non binary that they hated their period and never felt connected to it. I don‚Äôt hate it, but I never really ever acknowledged it.

2019-11-15 00:28:19,dwintz,2,1,"Hi, so I'm a person who was assigned female at birth but is unsure if they fit with their gender. The thing is that I'm not sure if I just reject gender stereotypes (because in my opinion the idea that your gender defines your personality is bollocks) or if I'm actually non binary. I've been struggling with my gender for over ten years now.  Most of my childhood I just said fuck gender and was just able to be a person without it mattering. I never got on with the boys or the girls, I was always alone and I always hated being referred as a girl and wearing stereotypical clothing and having long hair and doing girly things. When I was about ten I found out what transgender in the binary sense meant and I was like ""oh, this makes sense"" and for about six months I wore makeshift binders in secret and I chopped off all my hair and pretended to be a cis boy when I was alone.

I only just discovered recently what non binary actually means as I come from a transphobic household where the main concept is that you are born male or female and that is who you are forever. The term makes quite a bit of sense for me now that I have a better understanding of what it means although I'm not entirely sure yet whether it fits or not. 
What worries me is that I may have just met a lot of nonbinary people recently and seen more online representation and that I may be just subconsciously copying others and transferring my emotions around finally coming to terms with liking women and being fully gay into something else. I don't want to say that I'm nonbinary and then realise that I'm wrong and it was just a phase and I'm just a lesbian because that would badly misrepresent people who really are nonbinary and obviously I know that this is a serious and real thing.

I\'ve been struggling with my gender for over ten years now.  Most of my childhood I just said fuck gender and was just able to be a person without it mattering. I never got on with the boys or the girls, I was always alone and I always hated being referred as a girl and wearing stereotypical clothing and having long hair and doing girly things.

Hi friends! I'm an AFAB lesbian. I've always thought I was a cis woman but lately I've been having some really intense dysphoria surrounding my period and uterus. I've wanted a hysterectomy for as long as I can remember but my dysphoria has gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. (A little graphic) when I'm on my period I feel like reaching in and ripping my uterus out (don't worry, I won't do that haha).¬†


Here's what I'm conflicted about: I know that having a uterus/period isn't synonymous with being a woman. The only reasons I want to be a woman are that I identify as a lesbian and have a ""feminine"" presentation. I realized that I don't need to identify as a woman to do either of those things. I recently got a pixie cut and it feels so right. I've also been dressing more androgynous and it feels wonderful. I also wish I had a deeper voice.


On the other hand, I'm fine with my chest (in fact, I could go bigger). I love my name (woman's name) and so far I'm fine with she/her pronouns. But my concern is that these are all surface level things and I need to do some more reflection to figure out how I really feel.

2019-11-20 07:42:28,dyyry9,0,1,"To start off to explain some of my background a little for context, I'm part Japanese and from a mixed race family and growing up my parents were perhaps a bit racist. I've felt very disconnected from my heritage because my parents were always very insistent that since we live in the west (I live in America) we must look and act western and as a result of that I was never really exposed to Japanese culture for the most part. So when I first moved away from my parents, I decided to change my name from a western sounding name to a name of Japanese origin to embrace my heritage more and eventually I decided upon the name Yuna. I've since then come out as nonbinary and I'm worried as to whether or not I even should change my name. I know Yuna in Japanese can be either a girls name or a boys name but also in places like Korea where the name is more common it's typically viewed as a girl's name.

I let her know that I didn‚Äôt care for them and that the way I want to view my body is with a flat chest covert in certain tattoos. I don‚Äôt want the pectoral male anatomy tho.

So i stoped thinking i'm an alien when i was 14, yeah always so diffrent in everything i hated pink calor just because it's told girls calor i always been more boylish, i hated skirts and robes. ƒ∞ never knew why i'm like this so i told my self maybe you're an alien who should have a secret identify, i told my best friends i'm an alien, i'm not joking! But when i was 14 one of my best friend came out and said she is pan i was like what is it, i started to look and learn this new world. I knew i'm bi  immediately and i wasn't scared to tell that to everyone. But after couble of mounths i realized i was in denial for years, i was so scared because my mom always told me that there's only 2 genders, yeah you can be trans but you have to be boy or girl. I always felt like none i always been the odd in eveywhere and i was tired to fit myself in to the boxes so i stoped the denial and just try to live without telling anyone. But it was harder than the alien thing, so i started be so angry to myself and my body i don't know how but after that anger i started to say myself you're just a boylish bi girl there is nothing wrong with you stop this bullshits so just like that i put myself back to my cage. I said to myself you will love your body when you get your boobs smaller. Well guess what? I get surgery and i still hate them. Anyway after the surgery i was so sure about eveything and i said okey you couldn't change your mind then just try to change your body and your friends. So yeah i stoped denial fully in july, now i'm just trying to be myself and open to everyone i came ot to my mom 1 mount ago she was drunk and i was tips so i wasn't sure how it went but the next day she said girl less and it's getting lesser everyday she still think one day i will be sure and turn to a boy i'm sory mom but i'm not ftm. Well and my friends some of them were cool and some of them just needs time to understand it's not a joke, reality. But i can't make mt name eric at least not my hometown and when i said what i thought i make al my friends said just no they loved my name and me too but it gives me so many disphoria, i don't want that toxic feeling in me i said this to them million times well it didn't changed at all and i don't know what to do, probably need to came out again to all of my friends because some of them knows some of them don't.

But when i was 14 one of my best friend came out and said she is pan i was like what is it, i started to look and learn this new world. I knew i'm bi  immediately and i wasn't scared to tell that to everyone. But after couble of mounths i realized i was in denial for years, i was so scared because my mom always told me that there's only 2 genders, yeah you can be trans but you have to be boy or girl. I always felt like none i always been the odd in eveywhere and i was tired to fit myself in to the boxes so i stoped the denial and just try to live without telling anyone. But it was harder than the alien thing, so i started be so angry to myself and my body i don't know how but after that anger i started to say myself you're just a boylish bi girl there is nothing wrong with you stop this bullshits so just like that i put myself back to my cage. I said to myself you will love your body when you get your boobs smaller. Well guess what? I get surgery and i still hate them. Anyway after the surgery i was so sure about eveything and i said okey you couldn't change your mind then just try to change your body and your friends. So yeah i stoped denial fully in july, now i'm just trying to be myself and open to everyone i came ot to my mom 1 mount ago she was drunk and i was tips so i wasn't sure how it went but the next day she said girl less and it's getting lesser everyday she still think one day i will be sure and turn to a boy i'm sory mom but i'm not ftm. Well and my friends some of them were cool and some of them just needs time to understand it's not a joke, reality. But i can't make mt name eric at least not my hometown and when i said what i thought i make al my friends said just no they loved my name and me too but it gives me so many disphoria, i don't want that toxic feeling in me i said this to them million times well it didn't changed at all and i don't know what to do, probably need to came out again to all of my friends because some of them knows some of them don't. \nanyways after this long talk my questiƒ±n is how i can make my friens okey whit my new name and how i can came out.

I'm impartial to weight distribution (especially since I plan to get top surgery either way), BUT I am super uncomfortable with the idea of bottom growth. I hear that that is one of the first things to change if you take testosterone so it would be difficult to just get the changes that I'd be happy with. I've basically accepted that those changes won't happen and I'm not too dysphoric about those things so I think I can live. 
My query is, are there other ways of achieving these things? I have pcos so I already have a pretty fuzzy face and I know that there are hair growth treatments that COULD stimulate that, but I believe hair would only grow there so long as the treatments are used. I also know that voice training is a possibility, but I just wanted to see if anyone knew of any other, less well known things that could have these effects.",NonBinaryTalk,Testosterone but only kinda?,1575166398.0,"{'created_utc': 1575141198, 'id': 'e41oxo', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""I'm afab and like the idea of a voice drop and facial hair.
