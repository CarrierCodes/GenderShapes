For context, this is not a coming out story, its simply a college-age superhero story with lgbtq and minority main characters. It's gonna be narrated from the 3rd person limited perspective so i want to get this character's internal dialogue right with respect to this identity.

Okay so to the questions:

1. I read that its not uncommon for nb people to choose to go by gendered pronouns like he/him instead of they/them. Can i ask to those of you that choose to do so, and to those that don't, what if any is your reasoning?

2. How often do yall think about your gender expression? For example, as a guy im constantly policing my own language and thought processes to tamp down the inherent sexist thoughts i was raised on as a dude, and i know my girl friends do the same from the other way, but how do yall handle things like that?

3. How do you define your attraction? Since gay/lesbian is same sex attraction, bi is same and other, etc, how would you define a relationship with a binary person? 

4. What, if any, story tropes have you read about nb people that you really didnt like? Any that you really did? Anything I could include in the story to make thia character's life more relatable/recognizable as a non-binary experience?

2019-06-20 06:48:24,c2soir,12,4,"hi. before reading this, please remember to be very critical and skeptical of me. i want some harsh opinions. this is a struggle for me and i want a firm yes or no, not ""everyone is valid"" (which, of course, everyone is, but you get the idea).

i am 18. i have had gender dysphoria all my life, in ways i was too young to begin to understand until about age 11. i came out as trans male when i was 12. i socially transitioned that same year. when i was 13, i began to question myself. i dont know what kicked it off, its been too long to remember. i came out as agender at age 13, which my parents were confused by but ok with. i went by a gender-neutral name, but everyone just took me for a girl, called me she/her, etc. this made me massively dysphoric, and i retreated back to presenting as male, using a male name, and using he/him.

from about... age 15 on, i began telling myself i would come out as nonbinary after i got sexual reassignment surgery (which yes i still do want). at age 17, i began thinking about it more and more. it started nagging at me. i hesitantly asked my 3 closest friends to use they/them pronouns for me and call me a shortened, gender-neutral version of my legal (male) name. they agreed. i started T about 4 months ago.

i have been very, VERY hesitant to claim the label of nonbinary/agender for multiple reasons. my friends are very iffy about the validity of nb people and i honestly just feel stupid talking to them about it. one of them told me i am just a gnc man, but someone else pointed out i do nothing that would be considered gnc for men (aside from keep stuffed animals, though im no pillar of masculinity either). i also feel like i am appropriating the label of nonbinary. i know some dysphoric nb people who have been out for longer and i feel like im stepping on toes here, especially because they have such dysphoria about it. 

in case you are interested in my dysphoria... i have a lot of dysphoria about my genitals, had top surgery at age 16 cuz of dysphoria, and am dysphoric about my lack of body hair. i also have what i would call ""external dysphoria"" about my hips, voice, and height. what i mean by ""external dysphoria"" is that i dont mind them in and of themselves, but the fact people can use those clues to tell i am AFAB makes me super dysphoric because i dont want to be seen as female ever. being called she/her gives me gender dysphoria no matter the circumstance, being called he/him is fine and i dont mind, being called they/them is heavily preferred and gives me ""gender euphoria"".


TL;DR: basically, being called...
female= horrible, awful, cant stand
male= okay, i dont mind, i could live like this
neither= best, preferred, ideal

Yesterday, after about a year and a half (but also like lifetime??) of fighting with myself, I finally came out as NB. I did it in a casual way as that's what felt right to me. Literally just a picture of me smiling that has my name and pronouns, but it felt so right and good and that's all I wanted it to be. SOOOOO many of my amazing friends showed support, 10/10 said ""well duh!!"" (In a nice way, it was very comforting!) 
Well, I've brought it up the idea of NB to my parents several times, and every time we discuss it they mock it HARD COREEEE. My parents aren't bad people, I think they're maybe just old. Anyway, my mom saw my post (we don't live together) and called me screaming and crying and saying she couldn't believe I didn't have a sit down talk and all that with them. I apologized for hurting her feelings, but every time I tried to explain why I felt uncomfortable she got more upset and said she couldn't believe I was making her feel bad about this and all that. I'm sorry I'm not very good at explaining things, I half tuned out because it was just so....sad. so many people in my life are happy for me and today is my first day being out as NB, and I feel like myself and comfy in my identity for the first time. 
Anyway, it's hard because after my parents reaction I sort of just want to go ""haha I guess it was a phase!!!"" Even though it's not and it doesn't feel that way at all. No one in my life has made it seem like a burden except my parents, and that hurts like a motherfucker. 

Anyway, that is all, thank you if you read the whole thing and I know you're all sending good vibes.

2019-06-23 05:33:37,c3zpy6,0,6,"I realised I was NB about 4 years ago and went through a trans-masculine phase, thinking that for people to accept I was NB, I had to have a more male/neutral presentation. As of a year or so ago, I fully embraced my feminine side (and my boobs ha) and am female expressing. I realised how I looked didn't have to coincide with other people's perceptions of being NB, I needed to look in a way that made me happy and comfortable.

Anywho, I've come out to coworkers before in the past and it's gone completely tits up and has put me off even trying again. I just dealt with being misgendered and it sucked. I even had someone harass me about being a part of the LGBT community which ended up in multiple meetings with said person and HR.

I've just started a new job at an arts centre after a few months of being unemployed. Everyone there is really lovely and I want to be my authentic self when I work there but was wondering how to broach the subject and what to say after having bad experiences before in the past.

I'm basically worried that people 'wont get it' or won't be able to use my they/them pronouns as I present femininely and pass as female.
