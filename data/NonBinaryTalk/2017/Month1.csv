I am unable to take testosterone at this point in time (no health insurance, Medicaid has been a bitch so I kind of gave up). The voice try I use isn't too much lower, I still sound like a woman, (if I try to sound  like a man I sound goofy) but I'm hoping maybe if I lower my pitch every week or something I'll hopefully be able to use a lower and lower voice until I sound more ambiguously gendered, or even like a man. However, I do have problems staying consistent 

I get constantly misgendered, sometimes even by people that know better. Most will catch themselves almost immediately, but fact is I look and sound like a woman. I think my voice being lower would cut down significantly on that, because even if I look like a woman if people can match a different voice to my face they might get that my ""inner voice"" is different from my appearance suggests.
