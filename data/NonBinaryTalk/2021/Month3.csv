2021-03-03 01:12:30,lwhkca,1,1,"When I started scrutinizing my identity, that looked like nurturing my feminine attributes and finding euphoria in them. I discovered that they/them pronouns felt good, and referring to myself as ""not-a-man,"" and even as a girl sometimes, felt good. Femininity was a rabbit hole, and I was excited to see how deep it went for me. That's a process that's ongoing, and I'm still taking fun and fulfillment from it.

Over time though, all of this started to make me uncomfortable with the masculine parts of myself that I still felt attached to. Some parts of my ""manhood"" were quickly identified as performative and disingenuous and were easily shed. Other stuck around, and there was guilt in continuing to them. It cast doubt on whether I'd interpreted things and put the pieces together correctly.

And then recently, I started trying to view things from - quite literally - the other direction. Society wants to pigeon-hole me as a man. That conditions me to think of my experience as starting from Manhood**‚Ñ¢** and moving toward femininity. But I've found that by centering the femininity, taking myself as intrinsically female with some masculine traits, everything seems to lock into place a little better.

To be fair, this has made my discomfort with my body quite a bit more pronounced. But it's amazing how much it's altered my sense of self for the better. Things like nostalgia for my - very traditionally male - childhood, and my hobbies which are admittedly pretty ""white boy shit"" have been given back to me without guilt, and I feel less weird about holding up androgynous AFAB people as role models, as well as femme people. 

You know, after trying to organize this sentiment enough to get it in writing, I think the real moral of the story is that I'm starting to move out of the ""exploring my identity"" phase, into actually embodying it.

1) You are not a rabbit, you are not a fairy, you are a human. Just because you don't fit into the binary of male or female doesn't mean you do not fit into the binary of person or animal.

2) It's always younger teens and children from 10-15. The age itself isn't the issue, it's the fact that these kids don't understand that trans people get killed, beaten, tortured, and turned away for who they are while this child is pretending to be a rabbit.

3) It's an attention thing, I'm pretty sure. I don't think I need to explain on this one, go to someones TikTok who has these pronouns in their bio, watch 3 of their videos, then you'll understand. (P.S It's almost always the ""Gacha Kids"")

4) They make these pronouns their whole personality, once again, go to a TikTok page with these pronouns in their bio and you'll understand.

5) Ive mentioned this before but It mocks us. It makes me feel like a joke. It makes me so angry that these kids can just come out to their parents as a ""vampire"" without the fear of transphobic parents because they don't understand.

I don\'t think I need to explain on this one, go to someones TikTok who has these pronouns in their bio, watch 3 of their videos, then you\'ll understand. (P.S It\'s almost always the ""Gacha Kids"")\n\n4) They make these pronouns their whole personality, once again, go to a TikTok page with these pronouns in their bio and you\'ll understand.\n\n5) Ive mentioned this before but It mocks us. It makes me feel like a joke. It makes me so angry that these kids can just come out to their parents as a ""vampire"" without the fear of transphobic parents because they don\'t understand. They don\'t feel the fear that some of us do. They don\'t feel the fear because they see it as ""fun"" or a ""trend"". \n\nThats really it, thank you for your time.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'The whole Bun &amp; Fae pronouns thing and the issue I have with it:', 'created': 1614855141.0}"

2021-03-04 18:47:05,lxrziw,0,3,"This is going to be a long one. You ready?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start off by saying I'm AFAB, 21+. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every month, for the last few months, around menstruation time I've experienced intense feelings around my body and having been born with a vagina and all that fun shit. And then it fades out until next menstruation. Sometimes I wish I had a penis, sometimes I wish I had bigger breasts and a more feminine body. Sometimes I'm okay with having a vagina. It's very confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had this shit since before I could remember, which, in a lot of ways, doesn't help. I thought a lot of it was typical and something that everyone went through. A family member has repeatedly told me a story of when I was a toddler: they took me to the store, and another customer called me ""a cute little girl"". I apparently got very upset and yelled, because ""I'm a boy and boys aren't cute, they're handsome"".

A few years later, around age 7-8, I wanted my family to call me by a boys' name from a video game series I really liked. They all shrugged it off/ignored me and I didn't keep it up and wasn't much bothered by it.

But my entire childhood, everyone (myself included) just figured ""Oh, she's trying to be like her brother"", which wasn't entirely wrong--I idolized the hell out of my brother growing up. So it made sense: I copied his mannerisms and acted like him and wanted to be a boy like him, because I loved him and looked up to him. ... But I never ""grew out of it"" as people expected me to (my immediate family wasn't like this, but some more distant family members pressed it). And I don't know how much of that is ""normal kid looking up to their sibling"" stuff. I have sisters, and I didn't try to copy them, but my brother was closest to me in age.

&amp;#x200B;

I was, by a parent who wasn't in my life too much, occasionally forced to wear dresses for holidays at a young age. That stopped pretty quickly, thankfully, because I hated it. The parent who did raise me encouraged me to wear whatever I wanted, and for the majority of my life that meant baggy mens' shirts, women's jeans, and mens' sneakers (they physically fit better lol). 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't try skirts until I was nearing the end of my high school years, and though I didn't get any bad comments on it, it was experimental. I didn't feel more comfortable wearing skirts until after I graduated. Until last year, I'd only worn dresses when forced to at family events. It takes a lot for me to build up to the idea of wearing a skirt/dress, so I rarely do it, but sometimes I enjoy it. But usually I'd rather not put forth the mental effort. A lot of that is insecurity, I think? You go your entire life dressing a certain way and it can be very hard to try new things.

I've never been interested in makeup (tried it a few times, it's okay, love it on other people, but I don't like putting the time/energy/effort into it myself). I flip-flop between ""yeah, I want to be pregnant some day"" and ""god, I just want to remove my eggs and have a surrogate instead, because being pregnant sounds fucking horrible"" because I 100% want biological children some day.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a strictly female name. I *love* my name. Wouldn't change it for the world. I also like she/her pronouns and don't feel comfortable when people think I'm anything but she/her (this has only ever happened online). I don't like being called they and I don't like being called he.

I've never connected/clicked well with women. I think part of it is the troubles I've suffered with my female parent, but to this day, whenever I try to ""fit in"" with a group of women, I feel horribly, horribly out of place. I don't know how to talk, how to be myself, around them because nothing clicks. And it's obvious to them, I can tell, and it just makes things even more uncomfortable. I feel like I have to act and fake who I am. And then I feel guilty, because women are people and I should be able to just be comfortable around women like I do around men, but I can't seem to. I feel like I stick out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't necessarily ""feel"" like a man, but also don't really ""feel"" like a woman. So that leads me here, to where I've been reading and reading and giving myself headaches and anxiety. Writing this out has helped a lot. But yeah, I think I'm NB (non-binary woman, maybe? genderfluid? Specifics are up in the air). 

Also, I'll throw it out there that I am in therapy. I've got a bunch of shit I feel I need to work through before I broach this kind of stuff to my therapist, but I'll get there.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so now that that's out of the way, the issues I have with myself and my insecurities in this area are largely tied to dating. I thought I was exclusively attracted to cis-men, but recently I was super into a person (amab) who came out as NB, so I guess that's up in the air too. I've never been into super masculine men. I'm undoubtedly only attracted to penises but I think it's also expanded beyond cis-men and maybe to nb people too? Attraction is fucking weird, amiright?

So I guess, from there, my concerns are mainly oriented towards like... how is it dating as an NB person attracted primarily cis people? That's broad and everyone's experience is going to be different, I suppose, but I don't really know how to articulate this shit. I'm kind-of-but-not-fully-a-woman?

So my name/pronouns are entirely feminine but personality-wise and brain-wise I don't feel much like a woman. So I think I'm NB. So at what point do I tell someone that in the dating process? I'd feel like I'm lying if I never told this hypothetical future partner. 

I've had partners in the past, and not one of them ever cared about my mostly androgynous dress style, disinterest in makeup, and general kind of more ""masculine""ish personality. My biggest concerns, I suppose, are the labels. So maybe I'm overthinking it? I fully intend to keep going how I am presentation-wise, I just feel like accepting this in my own head would make me feel less stressed overall. 

Have you come out to your SO? How'd they take it? How is it when their sexual/romantic preferences are lined up specifically with a gender that you no longer identify as?

Basically the point of a pronoun in language is so you don't need to say the person's name every time you reference them. Functionally, he/she and they get that job done. There's only 3, not bad.


But with neo pronouns, there's no limit to what your pronouns can be, everyone can have different ones, so effectively you've made them useless in language. 


Now I'm not here to say you should force yourself to use pronouns that have connotations that make you uncomfortable like he or she or even they potentially. Moreso I'm here to say we need to make pronouns devoid of any connotation, so that they just reference a person or persons, we do that by only having one set.


The first choice that comes to mind is They, but I am no language or gender scholar, so if there are problems with that I believe you.

But I feel there is a solution that doesn't make people use words to reference themselves that make them uncomfortable but maintains the usefulness of pronouns in language.


Edit: two things

1. Idk how I feel about the main argument used against this idea being ""there's so few of them it doesn't even matter""

So if there were more of them then it would be an issue? Not sure how many neo-pronouns users would like that sentiment

2. I see neo-pronouns as a reasonable and expected response to a society that has pressured so many of us into acting like something we are not. I absolutely respect anyone's choice of pronouns that make them feel comfortable, valid and seen in a world that can be absolutely terrible at times. Im just foreseeing an issue in language if everyone starts using unique pronouns. I don't think there needs to be this issue, I think there's a win-win scenario here if we're willing to look for it.

Edit 2: pronouns should have never had gender affiliations, so giving them even more seems unproductive. Conjunctions aren't gendered, adjectives aren't gendered, why should pronouns be? As someone helped me articulate in the comments, pronouns should be completely seperated from gender, not even gender neutral.

2021-03-08 03:43:16,m06zei,0,1,"My mom and I went through old pictures a couple of nights ago. For reference, I am 24 years old, biologically female (she/her/hers). I used to insist on ‚Äúboy‚Äôs clothes‚Äù, which she thinks caused the teasing and bullying I went through and then she said ‚ÄúHow did I let you get away with that?‚Äù What she meant was that back then, why didn‚Äôt she realize I could get teased. But I assured her she did the right thing by letting me wear what I wanted, and that it would have caused a rift between us if she did not. 

Within this so-called ‚Äúphase‚Äù, I was Ariel one Halloween and had some other things sprinkled in, eventually wearing ‚Äúgirl‚Äù clothes for short periods of time. But let‚Äôs be honest, who *doesn‚Äôt* want to be a Disney princess for Halloween, including boys??? We had this role-play game together where I would run around the house in a towel (as a cape) pretending to be the Beast from Beauty and the Beast. We would reenact the scene where he comes back to life. For my 5th birthday party, we had a Toy Story 2 theme. Jessie is one of the characters, and my name is Jess. Guess what? I dressed up as Woody, not Jessie (who has my name dammit!). I cut the hair off of any dolls I had. I had Power Rangers PJs. I wanted a masculine haircut, but I wasn‚Äôt allowed. I wanted nothing more than to be seen as a boy. As you can see, EVERY.DAMN.SIGN.WAS.THERE. (except I was fine with my body and the inevitability of puberty). 

Then at age 10, I started to ‚Äúconform‚Äù, albeit it was uncomfortable. Eventually it became less and less uncomfortable, and I just accepted myself as a seemingly cis girl. Still, I didn‚Äôt fit in with the girls, and I didn‚Äôt fit in with the boys. I never matched exclusively masculine or feminine vibes. I feel like I‚Äôm speaking a different language from feminine women and masculine men. 

For the next 10 years, I tried to live like a typical adolescent/young adult girl. But there was still something bugging me. I got constant unwelcome thoughts popping in my head that I was a guy that I would immediately push down. I unfortunately went to a Catholic high school to avoid bullying, so it‚Äôs not like freedom of expression or gender nonconformity was encouraged there. I had a to wear a skirt every day(you couldn‚Äôt catch me dead in a skirt outside of school hours). I never caught on with how to ‚Äúgirl‚Äù (I‚Äôm using that as a verb). My small amount of make up I used, which was only eyeliner, would always get smudged over the day from blinking and I never figured out how to prevent that from happening. I still didn‚Äôt dress particularly femininely. Like I said, I didn‚Äôt vibe with other girls and couldn‚Äôt figure out what it was supposed to be like to be a teen girl. I was totally clueless and still am. 

Finally, in college (20), I decided to peruse the men‚Äôs section of clothing and bought some stuff. It gradually became more and more of my wardrobe until finally it is 99% of it now. So at 20, I formed the identity of a gender nonconforming woman. I stopped shaving my legs (but I still buzz them), I stopped wearing bras, and as I said changed my wardrobe. I also started pushing people to call me Jess instead of Jessica. I didn‚Äôt even realize this all was a form of social transitioning I wasn‚Äôt acknowledging that was occurring right under my nose! 

But here‚Äôs the thing. I feel like I still kinda *have* to somewhat identify as a girl because of my anatomy. I know that‚Äôs not what reflects who I am on the inside, but I still call myself a girl a lot. Still, it‚Äôs in my plans to have a tubal ligation eventually, not only because I don‚Äôt want kids, but because it would make me feel like I‚Äôm less of a woman. Because I feel like I can‚Äôt escape womanhood, I have to push myself away from it as much as possible. I feel like I‚Äôm not even supposed to have the ability to get pregnant. However, I don‚Äôt have dysphoria over my breasts (but would if they were bigger) or any other part of my body. And dammit, I still use exclusively she/her/hers pronouns! 

And on top of all that, I have some issues with several trans talking points, like kids taking hormone blockers. The research around it is muddy and I just know it would have been the wrong thing for me, so it feels personal. I had a bunch of signs of being a trans kid and then my identity changed.

I used to insist on ‚Äúboy‚Äôs clothes‚Äù, which she thinks caused the teasing and bullying I went through and then she said ‚ÄúHow did I let you get away with that?‚Äù What she meant was that back then, why didn‚Äôt she realize I could get teased. But I assured her she did the right thing by letting me wear what I wanted, and that it would have caused a rift between us if she did not. \n\nWithin this so-called ‚Äúphase‚Äù, I was Ariel one Halloween and had some other things sprinkled in, eventually wearing ‚Äúgirl‚Äù clothes for short periods of time. But let‚Äôs be honest, who *doesn‚Äôt* want to be a Disney princess for Halloween, including boys??? We had this role-play game together where I would run around the house in a towel (as a cape) pretending to be the Beast from Beauty and the Beast. We would reenact the scene where he comes back to life. For my 5th birthday party, we had a Toy Story 2 theme. Jessie is one of the characters, and my name is Jess. Guess what? I dressed up as Woody, not Jessie (who has my name dammit!). I cut the hair off of any dolls I had. I had Power Rangers PJs. I wanted a masculine haircut, but I wasn‚Äôt allowed. I wanted nothing more than to be seen as a boy. As you can see, EVERY.DAMN.SIGN.WAS.THERE. (except I was fine with my body and the inevitability of puberty). \n\nThen at age 10, I started to ‚Äúconform‚Äù, albeit it was uncomfortable. Eventually it became less and less uncomfortable, and I just accepted myself as a seemingly cis girl. Still, I didn‚Äôt fit in with the girls, and I didn‚Äôt fit in with the boys. I never matched exclusively masculine or feminine vibes. I feel like I‚Äôm speaking a different language from feminine women and masculine men. \n\nFor the next 10 years, I tried to live like a typical adolescent/young adult girl. But there was still something bugging me. I got constant unwelcome thoughts popping in my head that I was a guy that I would immediately push down. I unfortunately went to a Catholic high school to avoid bullying, so it‚Äôs not like freedom of expression or gender nonconformity was encouraged there. I had a to wear a skirt every day(you couldn‚Äôt catch me dead in a skirt outside of school hours). I never caught on with how to ‚Äúgirl‚Äù (I‚Äôm using that as a verb). My small amount of make up I used, which was only eyeliner, would always get smudged over the day from blinking and I never figured out how to prevent that from happening. I still didn‚Äôt dress particularly femininely. Like I said, I didn‚Äôt vibe with other girls and couldn‚Äôt figure out what it was supposed to be like to be a teen girl. I was totally clueless and still am. \n\nFinally, in college (20), I decided to peruse the men‚Äôs section of clothing and bought some stuff. It gradually became more and more of my wardrobe until finally it is 99% of it now. So at 20, I formed the identity of a gender nonconforming woman. I stopped shaving my legs (but I still buzz them), I stopped wearing bras, and as I said changed my wardrobe. I also started pushing people to call me Jess instead of Jessica. I didn‚Äôt even realize this all was a form of social transitioning I wasn‚Äôt acknowledging that was occurring right under my nose! \n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing. I feel like I still kinda *have* to somewhat identify as a girl because of my anatomy. I know that‚Äôs not what reflects who I am on the inside, but I still call myself a girl a lot. Still, it‚Äôs in my plans to have a tubal ligation eventually, not only because I don‚Äôt want kids, but because it would make me feel like I‚Äôm less of a woman. Because I feel like I can‚Äôt escape womanhood, I have to push myself away from it as much as possible. I feel like I‚Äôm not even supposed to have the ability to get pregnant. However, I don‚Äôt have dysphoria over my breasts (but would if they were bigger) or any other part of my body. And dammit, I still use exclusively she/her/hers pronouns! \n\nAnd on top of all that, I have some issues with several trans talking points, like kids taking hormone blockers. The research around it is muddy and I just know it would have been the wrong thing for me, so it feels personal. I had a bunch of signs of being a trans kid and then my identity changed.\n\nRant over', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'I‚Äôve had signs since I‚Äôm 4 years old, but I don‚Äôt have body dysphoria and only have limited social dysphoria.

2021-03-09 21:00:13,m1g69y,5,1,"Hi there!

Im trying to word all this in a way that doesn't make me sound too pathetic, but to be honest, lately it feels like I kind of am. I've been questioning my gender for a couple months now and it's been pretty hard on me. One of the hardest things for me has been the fact that I don't have a single person in my life that identifies as LGBTQ+, so I really don't have anyone who understands what I'm going through. My wife is trying her best to be supportive, but she can't relate to the what I've been feeling, and she's scared that if I make any real changes she'll be losing me in some way. 

I'm 25 AMAB and I've spent my whole life as a cishet guy. About 6 months ago I realized I'm bisexual and it felt like a bit of a shock to me.

2021-03-10 00:06:54,m1k93x,7,1,"So I made a post a few weeks ago about binding with a full time job. I just started a new job where I am working 8.5 hour days with a 45 minute commute, meaning when I bind I have to bind for 10+ hours at least. However, I would actually rather die than go to work without my binder.
You guys had a lot of helpful advice, and I really appreciate it. I have been trying to take my binder off during my lunch if I start to get uncomfortable, as well as taking it off for the drive home. With the way my schedule is set up for this new position though, every other week I have a six day stretch without a day off. Even with taking my breaks, I have noticed that by the last few days of this stretch, I have been experiencing some mild back pain. Nothing extreme, just a mild soreness. 
With that being said, I‚Äôm trying to figure out some other ways to give my chest a bit of a break.
I‚Äôve seen a lot about transtape recently, and I was thinking about trying it out. My chest would be a C cup, so since there isn‚Äôt as much compression with the tape, I wouldn‚Äôt want it for every day use. However, I ordered a hoodie that is within dress code, and I think with that I could probably get away with just taping. 
I know tape can be worse as far as skin elasticity goes, but with the size of my chest I wouldn‚Äôt qualify for keyhole or peri anyways. I‚Äôm more concerned with putting less strain on my ribs and back. 
Would taping for a day or two in the middle/at the end of my work week actually be better for my body than binding? Is taping actually any safer? What is your guys experience? Since transtape is relatively newer it‚Äôs hard to find much about this online.

2021-03-10 00:16:13,m1kg6b,13,1,"Hey everyone, I'm Aspen. I'm genderqueer, almost one year into my gender journey, and I'm 29. I would really like to make some new queer friends, and to that end I thought I would post here and see if anyone has or knows of a good Discord server geared toward nonbinary adults (preferably 25+, but I'm not really picky), as I would like to get to know some more enbies in my own age range. 

I recently joined and subsequently left another nonbinary server that seemed to be geared mostly toward teenagers. I'm absolutely thrilled that young queer folks have safe spaces online these days, they simply didn't exist when I was growing up. But that's just not the space for me. :)

I'm also open to just chatting one on one with some of you, if anyone would like to message me. 

Some stuff about me: I love cats and currently have one kitty. I'm a demisexual lesbian, also a late bloomer in that regard (I realized I was a lesbian and not actually bisexual last August) and I've been in a heterosexual marriage for the past 10 years. I recently asked for a divorce, and things are very amicable now that my soon-to-be-ex-husband understands the root of our issues over the years. 

I am an artist, with widely-varied interests but with an especial love for fiber arts and painting. I crochet, embroider, knit, needle felt, paint in acrylics, I write fiction and poetry, sometimes I make jewelry, and I also love nature photography, though I haven't been able to get out and take photos in a long time. I am learning to draw, and to paint in watercolors, and I want to learn to spin yarn, weave, sew, dye fibers, and machine knit. I have painted in oils in the past. Basically, if it's creative and artsy, I'm into it. 

I have a lot of free time on my hands because I'm disabled due to chronic pain, chronic illness, and mental illness. I love talking with my friends, watching animated TV, reading, and coloring. Sometimes I play games like Sims 4 or Civilization VI or Two Point Hospital or Stardew Valley, but gaming isn't really a big part of my life anymore. I'm a witch and a pagan, and have followed this spiritual path for almost half my life now. I collect tarot and oracle decks and love reading them and familiarizing myself with the cards' meanings. I love symbolism. Politically I'm extremely liberal and a strong proponent of feminism and equal rights, though to respect the rules of this subreddit let's keep discussions of that to private message.

I have been questionning myself for months and still do not know who i am. Also, i do not really understand the idea of gender. I mean, i know what gender is, but i always thought the term ""non binary"" accentuates gender stereotypes and what the lgbt community was fighting for. 

I know the differencies between gender identity and gender expression, but gender itself, in sociology, is the definition of a social construct defining what is ""feminine, associated to women"" and what is ""masculine, associated to men"". So, for an genderfuild person, feeling somedays ""masc"" and other days ""femme"" would not it be a ""Bad way"" to approve those stereotypes and ideas if what a man/woman should be ? Like : today, im feeling masc so im a man. 

To talk a little bit about myself, im AFAB, 19yo, and Always identified as a masculine lesbian. But since almost one year, i am questionning my gender and dont know what to base this thinking on and it really frustrating me. 
I sometimes feel what i interpret as dysphoria, i look at my breast and absolutely hate it (sometimes its with my curves also), even if there is days where i just accept it but dont like it yet. I consider top surgery, even if im not sure.
But that feeling do not make me less of a woman or more of a man isnt it ? Maybe im just non binary, i just dont want my identity to be the result of a ""gender stereotyped"" society. I can be a woman and masculine at the same time, like a man can be feminine and still feeling like a man. 

Im just a little bit upset because i dont understand this topic even after hours and hours of research. I know im not stupid and Can debate a lot of things. Maybe im just overthinking this thematic and totally forgot the essence of it.

I mean, i know what gender is, but i always thought the term ""non binary"" accentuates gender stereotypes and what the lgbt community was fighting for. \n\nI know the differencies between gender identity and gender expression, but gender itself, in sociology, is the definition of a social construct defining what is ""feminine, associated to women"" and what is ""masculine, associated to men"". So, for an genderfuild person, feeling somedays ""masc"" and other days ""femme"" would not it be a ""Bad way"" to approve those stereotypes and ideas if what a man/woman should be ? Like : today, im feeling masc so im a man. \n\nTo talk a little bit about myself, im AFAB, 19yo, and Always identified as a masculine lesbian. But since almost one year, i am questionning my gender and dont know what to base this thinking on and it really frustrating me. \nI sometimes feel what i interpret as dysphoria, i look at my breast and absolutely hate it (sometimes its with my curves also), even if there is days where i just accept it but dont like it yet. I consider top surgery, even if im not sure.\nBut that feeling do not make me less of a woman or more of a man isnt it ? Maybe im just non binary, i just dont want my identity to be the result of a ""gender stereotyped"" society. I can be a woman and masculine at the same time, like a man can be feminine and still feeling like a man. \n\nIm just a little bit upset because i dont understand this topic even after hours and hours of research. I know im not stupid and Can debate a lot of things. Maybe im just overthinking this thematic and totally forgot the essence of it.\n\nIm really sorry if i appear closed minded, im not i promise. And sorry for my bad english, im french. ;)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Can someone help me understanding the gender topic ?', 'created': 1615392611.0}"

2021-03-11 09:14:17,m2m73d,6,1,"Hello everyone! 

I've recently come to the realisation that I'm nonbinary (they/them, she/her and he/him are all good; thankfully pronouns are gender neutral in my language), and have disclosed this to my closest friends and family. They have been overwhelmingly supportive (Though granted, my parents don't really understand what this means, other than ""I'm who I've always been, I just understand myself better now.""), and I feel euphoric about affirming my gender identity. For the first time, I don't feel like an impostor or a misfit; this is who I am and I finally have a word that is consistent with how I feel.

However, I come from a place where feminism desperately needs advocacy and advancement - a society where conservative positions are still quite mainstream. I'm AFAB, and believed myself to be cis for over two decades. I've advocated for feminism and have succeeded in opening people's minds to feminism, intersectionality and other activism.

I recently had the chance to talk with a professor at my university, and it was fantastic, except for the part where she gendered me (in a friendly, affectionate way; she called me ""daughter"" in our language), and I didn't know how to react and tacitly accepted it. Feminism came up in our discussion, and I couldn't help but feel like the impostor I thought myself to be when I was cis. She's talking to me, assuming that I'm a woman just because of how I look and sound, but I'm not actually a woman, yet I don't know her well enough to disclose that casually.

In light of all this, part of me can't help but feel guilty about betraying my ""birth gender"", or worried about how my real gender and my support for feminism can coexist. I have advocated for various political causes my entire life, some of them not relevant to my identity as a person (refugees, ethnic minorities; not to mention the numerous causes outside my country I've called attention to), so this seems a little silly, but I worry that if I come out as nonbinary, I'll undermine myself as a feminist. Does that make sense? I know that anyone can be a feminist, but I am worried about how **others** will perceive it. 

This is also about a friend I have. He went from being critical of ""feminism"" (his idea of what it is) to interested and genuinely supportive and passionate after we had some serious discussions on the topic. I really like him (platonically) and trust him to have my back and be honest with me, so I'd like to come out to him sometime soon. Yet he's only just unlearning the conservative beliefs he's internalised; will going from ""Feminism is important and necessary because women are still oppressed"" to ""Hey, by the way, I'm not a woman."" confuse him and again, work to undermine what I have built?

After typing all this, I realise that this likely stems from internalised transphobia, and that I need to work on accepting myself. But my fears do have grounding in reality. As I said, I live in a society where people think they're enlightened about ""human rights"" and ""democracy"", but are quite reactionary socially speaking.

I am very uncertain about whether or not I am enby. 

I don't have gender dysphoria but it's really hard for me to define what feminine and what masculine is which is why I can't really say whether or not I identify with either of these.

It kinda feels like I am enby to express that it can't be defined. 

I feel like myself and I will just dress etc. the way I feel confortable but for me that is independent from my gender. 

Does that make sense? Am I enby or do I just have a hard time defining gender? Can one be enby without gender dysphoria?

When it comes to biology I‚Äôve had my periods permanently stopped since I was 13 because of the awful mental issues it caused me, in doing so I did not develop breasts or a figure. I look like puberty never happened at all. 

The lack of development was also due to body dysmorphia, I was severely anorexic starting around 6 years old this continued up until I was 20 and nearly died my recorded weight at that time was 75lbs. I knew I had to stop letting anorexia destroy me and I want to live to see who I become. I‚Äôm 22 now I‚Äôve been successful but I still struggle and avoid scales at all costs, even at doctors visits I‚Äôm too petrified to see the number rise and I can‚Äôt handle it mentally (109lbs as of now) so I eat regular normal sized meals even if I do not feel like it which is an on going battle.

I suffered from extremely low self esteem growing up. I was a generally a mediocre looking plain Jane with no womanly assets to flaunt like the girls my age at the time and even now. I was that weird tomboy who wore cargo shorts, never shaved or dressed up and refused to belong to any certain group because no matter how well I pretended to be like this or that I truly never fit. It was disheartening growing up and not feeling like I was girl enough to hang with the girls and not manly enough to join the boys. I was hazed all throughout wrestling in school to the point if I get my head hit I‚Äôm a goner but I joined sports over and over anyways, in my small victories I proved to myself I can do whatever I want gender/ other people do not dictate that. But still it felt wrong I still felt like a phony, a human chameleon at best. 

Throughout my life I‚Äôve been groomed and sexually assaulted. I was molested by 7 different men when I was a toddler 3-6 years old which I believe caused the anorexia, sex repulsion, body dysmorphia. I was groomed by an older man (21) when I was 11 until I was 15, I do not want to go into detail about the assault portion but needless to say I was beyond traumatized and very suicidal and my mom knew and ended up beating me, slapping me etc for the fact I wasn‚Äôt a pure little girl, I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt take the blame for any of this I didn‚Äôt want it like she assumed I didn‚Äôt even understand what was happening I just knew someone ‚Äúloved me‚Äù. In highschool the 21 year old‚Äôs sister whom I thought was my friend spread rape kink rumors about me and I was attacked on school property once but since it was my boyfriend I did nothing and his friends decided that meant the rumor was true and I was attacked by two other boys in that same year and never told anyone but two close friends and now reddit.. at that point in my life I didn‚Äôt want to be a female I was terrified. I dressed in so many layers and started having panic attacks to the point I never left my house, and after the assaults I begged to do online school and I did graduate which was all I cared about at the time. 

Although I‚Äôve had these negative experiences I‚Äôve pushed on. I work in a male dominated job that my family doesn‚Äôt approve of because they see me as a fragile girl and this makes me upset that they can‚Äôt see what I see. I‚Äôm getting muscular and toned, I don‚Äôt have spaghetti arms and legs anymore! I love the challenge, the brute work, the environment I love my job. I love the way my clothes fit, I openly present myself masculine more and more I‚Äôm becoming myself and it‚Äôs such a freeing feeling no matter what pressure I‚Äôm under I‚Äôm growing through it like a hearty little bean stalk.

I am NB, I love my facial hair and painting my nails. I feel more comfortable in a dress than pants and when it comes down to it - being seen as just male or just female makes me uncomfortable. I'd love to be able to paint my face but I just don't have the heart to fail at it ... Baby steps. 

I am also a consultant in a pretty old school company (big 4/MBB). So I present male at work. I often present male in my private life out of laziness... Because my pronouns are he/they - I don't really get misgendered. 

*Game changer* 
I am interviewing for a role at a mature startup. I told 1 interviewer I am GNB, still figuring out what that means for me - but 1 reason I would change jobs is for me to get to a place where I can be me at work. 

Where I need help: 
1. I feel guilty for saying I am GNB, because I am okish to present male- I feel like I am an imposter and making the lives of GNB people who are closer to the middle part of the gender binary spectrum, harder. I also feel weird about taking a job in tech that can be filled by a cis / trans girl who did not get to Pass Like I do. By presenting male - I got my male privilege. And I know they hire for diversity so it feels weird... I would also feel weird about not telling my new boss. 

Anyone else *closer* to the binary feel guilty for telling work you are GNB?

No. Lining all the traits up side by side... Guys, I was describing myself. An ideal version of me. I've been living vicariously all this time. I'm attracted to myself as a guy but I don't want to date him. In nearly every piece of my favourite media since I was young, I've found him, I've seen him, in glimpses. Now I'm this old I can finally put those sparks into a fire, all those bullet points into a list, that list of a parallel life I'm not living.

I could cry.

I've been living vicariously all this time. I'm attracted to myself as a guy but I don't want to date him. In nearly every piece of my favourite media since I was young, I've found him, I've seen him, in glimpses. Now I'm this old I can finally put those sparks into a fire, all those bullet points into a list, that list of a parallel life I'm not living. My utter can't-look-away attraction love has never been romantic. It's vicarious. It's the mirror reflection I never see, finally in front of me. I've never experienced envy for seeing this guy. Only a terrible, laughable, euphoric, totally projected vicarious love. I can't exist inside myself, and so I'm so happy when I see it out in the world. That's me. That's ME. I could laugh. I could cry.\n\nI know in mere hours this will fade and I will forget, I will drift out again. It will be lost. I will be cis again. These moments never last, they're never convincing enough.\n\nBut he'll be there still, in my mind's eye, burning as bright as a star, pulling as persistent as gravity."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': ""So I'm trans.

2021-03-13 14:15:17,m473o5,6,1,"So, I (18) am a non-binary person. I know that I own a penis. I like to call myself ""penis-owner"" so when people tell me to be a man I just say I am not a man but a penis-owner and don't want their gender roles on me. So yes, I am not angry for people misgendering me, but I rather want them to slowly learn how I hate the gender roles they put on people.

The worst example is my girlfriend. Once I was talking to her about the feeling I have that I don't feel like associating myself with men, and I absolutely relate to people like Sam Smith. Sam Smith is my absolute non-binary role model. So the conversation goes on and on. And to something I said about feeling more feminine than many other males so I dont like being called a man or a boy, my gf answered ""You are not as feminine as you think you are."" And: ""I know many more feminine boys than you."" 

It felt like she was not thinking that me wanting to get away from all this manliness-nonsense is valid. She is LGBTQ+ supporter and somewhat a bisexual herself so I do not know if I present myself wrong, or if she does not understand.

Getting people to understand that I am non-binary and dont want gender related stuff attached to me is becoming a pain and I dont feel valid and I feel that I am wrong. When I can not for example find something and my gf finds it in 5 seconds and she says ""Men are blind"" I always tell her I am not a man but a penis-owner and she tends to say ""Oh you are a little eh?"" I mean yes I kinda feel like both and neither. Man and woman. I have all those sides in me. But because I hate gender roles I want to be outside of all that sh*t.

And my gf is not the only one who has somehow told me my feelings about this are not valid, or always keep associating stuff with genders which drives me crazy. The worst one is not my gf, and she has begun to get all of this. But on the other hand, sometimes when a more conservative person tells me my gender is what I have in my pants not what I think and I got to be something, I lose all my will and just start to call myself a boy.

2021-03-13 16:53:35,m4a6fa,9,1,"I am a pan enby (32) AMAB, the enby egg cracked last year and  with it came new dating problems.

Before the shell cracked my issues were mainly that when I dated girls I was expected to have a masculine role and looks in my relationships with them, which is why I think most my relationships ended in the first place. Also heard the ""you are a straight guy, you are just confused"" line from dates way too often. With guys it wasn't necessarily like that but whenever I was a bit too feminine they bailed.

Now that the shell cracked, straight cis girls have pretty much cut me out completely (which is fine) and due to my looks I have been receiving attention from guys a lot more. However now I have another issue all together, most of the guys I have gone out with even though they say they are okay and understand non binary, keep getting disappointed when I don't wear make up and keep treating me like a girl (I don't really like being treated like a guy or a girl regardless of how I present any given day), and now I am even hearing ""you are just a confused trans girl"" and ""when you find the right guy, you'll transition full time"" (heavily implying that dating them will make me magically want to transition). 

Now, I know what you will say, just stop dating binary people that are mostly attracted to one sex and date pan sexual and non binary people. Which would be fine but the pool around here is very small and then from that pool finding someone I actually like is even more difficult. I went out with a couple of pan girls and a lesbian girl last year and those dates were a lot better, but with them I also think they expect me to be more feminine and use more make up (maybe this is in my head a bit, but maybe not).

Part of the issue is that due to work and life I don't present femenine a lot, and I am considerably more attractive when I present femenine, which I think disappoints a whole lot of people.

So I have been feeling a lot of internal and external pressure to just go girl full time, even though it's not what I want.

I went out with a couple of pan girls and a lesbian girl last year and those dates were a lot better, but with them I also think they expect me to be more feminine and use more make up (maybe this is in my head a bit, but maybe not).\n\nPart of the issue is that due to work and life I don\'t present femenine a lot, and I am considerably more attractive when I present femenine, which I think disappoints a whole lot of people.\n\nSo I have been feeling a lot of internal and external pressure to just go girl full time, even though it\'s not what I want.\n\nThis is more of a rant than asking for advice but it would be nice if some of you had some advice based on similar experiences.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Dating rant', 'created': 1615679615.0}"

Ever since questioning and then coming to terms with not being cis, I have started to feel social dysphoria around my chest and have really loved binding. I am only comfy with my partner touching my chest over the binder right now. But when I'm alone, even though I still get euphoria from my binder esp with clothes on, I am pretty unbothered about my chest. My feelings are iffy at worst and positive/familiar/sexy at best.

What is clear to me is that I know it's social dysphoria. My chest makes me feel feminised by Other People (inc through being in a sexy context with my partner). But alone, it's chill. 

When I first got my boobs when I was younger, I ADORED THEM! I wanted more! (I am pretty small chested). Over the years I have appreciated them and been chill with them. But my newly realised non binaryness has left me with social dysphoria - I know this is one thing about me that will ALWAYS get me misgendered. 

But I want to be comfy with my chest, just with me/my partner. I know this isn't something people can just think themselves into, but I think for me personally, it's about letting go of the idea that my tiddies are feminine. I don't think I want top surgery. I don't mind binding, it feels good. But I want to enjoy my chest for me and with my partner.

My gender has never mattered much to me personally, I'm very aware I enjoy the privileges that being a man entails, but in terms of how I think of myself it was never something I strongly identified with.

And then, a few months ago, I downloaded tik-tok for the first time. This sounds really silly, and I promise I am being sincere. I'd been aware of what being non-binary can entail, one of my closest friends recently came out, but I'd never seen what being non-binary 'looks like', I don't mean this stereotypically, I mean seeing people expressing themselves how they choose to. I don't know, I think it's really beautiful.

And I started thinking about myself and how, for a long while now, on and off since primary school, I've wanted to dress in 'feminine' clothing. Now, more and more, I feel like I want to wear a little bit of makeup, I've painted my nails before and I want SO badly to do it again and to wear it regularly, I'd love to feel confident in a dress.

Ok so. 27, she/her, born F. I've always had issues with my gender. I just thought they were normal. Now I'm not so sure. For example, female bodily functions always freaked me out when they'd happen to me.

I always thought these things were either a) normal or b) the result of a strict religious upbringing with strict gender expectations and the scars it left on me.

I watched some videos from trans and/or non binary folks describing their experiences with these things and realized that's exactly how I feel about my body doing all that stuff. I've got some dysphoria going on. 

What does that mean? Does having body or gender dysphoria mean I'm likely to be non-binary or trans? Or can I experience a good bit of dysphoria without having a different gender identity? 

Fwiw, I don't mind ""she/her."" I don't feel strongly about ""they/them;"" it feels a little weird tbh.

2021-03-15 14:34:05,m5lzp9,0,1,"Sometimes, I wonder if I‚Äôm lying.

I wonder if I‚Äôm lying to myself about my gender identity for whatever reason‚Äîto feel like I belong in a community, to not be associated with the binary gender with the exception of accountability regarding my innate male privilege in a cisnormative society, or because it feels good to satisfy the age-old feeling that I've never been one of these other people, to satisfy that with a new label that I have chosen for myself. 

A lie is told consciously and with intent to deceive. Maybe this is less of a lie and more of a delusion. But is a lie less of itself when told to oneself than it is when told to others? If it is a lie, what effect does it have on others if it's told primarily to oneself‚Äîa lie that, reiterated enough times, becomes a harmless, innocent truth? 

My truth. The truth I tell to others.

Maybe I'm deluded, confused about my gender identity. It feels that way and sometimes I think that's normal. The existence of other possibilities causes us to question the ‚Äúcertainties‚Äù we‚Äôve always clung to. But ""Who am I?"" is not something you scream into a void expecting an automatic answer, especially when the void is you. Eventually, you'll have to work to find that answer, or remain in a state of confusion. It's weird. Is finding a label equal to discovering an identity?

Mungo Park is turning in his grave right now.

Okay, so maybe he didn‚Äôt name the river. Sue me.

A label feels like something I simply stand behind, not something that makes me. Something to identify with when the need arises. Does my current label define me? Who am I without it? I am myself, no doubt, but who is that? I often think about labels and how they're constructs to put people into certain boxes, apart from helping them identify themselves, because people are easier to pinpoint when you trap them in boxes.

I think about my gender identity sometimes, how although I identify as agender I feel connections to manhood as well. Is this a form of fluidity? For me, unlike sexuality, the concept of gender is a wisp of smoke that I can never grasp. That's what I see when I think of gender. A wisp of smoke. One that I can't truly identify, or trap in one place, or give form to. It is, but that's all. I have no name to give to it that will truly fit, because to fit, there must be form. What do I call my gender: Stan? Adeola? Miguel? Whatever label fits for the time being is what I feel should work for me. Again, this raises questions about the fluidity of my gender. 

Sometimes, I wonder if I‚Äôm lying. I also wonder how it must feel to have wisp of smoke trapped in a box for you.

I also wonder if sliced bread goes with bananas and milk, but that‚Äôs another story.

Who am I, if I think that different identities might work for me at different times, that although I might be who I tell myself I am, I also might be someone else? I have never been decided about my identity. Who am I? I don‚Äôt know for sure.

My mother refused to accept it though, and basically guilted me back into the closet. That created trust issues with everyone around me, making it harder to be myself. The only person I really let in anymore is by brother, which is creating issues with everyone else around me.

Now onto the story:

My brother went out shopping with me to buy some feminine clothes today. It was a mess. The store clerk at the first store we went to kept repeatedly calling me ""gentleman"" (I've hated that term my whole life). I managed to bare with that (although I wanted to cry) though and even found a cute pink hoodie and some socks.

After that, we went to many stores, and despite desperately wanting femme clothes, I couldnt force myself to buy any of them. To make matters worse, I grabbed a coke off of a shelf, and the side busted in the cart, getting all over my brand new hoodie.

I thought that was the end of my nightmare trip, until I got home. Turns out my best friend wanted to go. He is trying so hard to be supportive, but I'm worried he won't be, and have unintentionally been pushing him away.

My friends have been overwhelmingly supportive and amazing. I feel so validated and like I‚Äôm not alone when I talk to them. The problem is my spouse. He‚Äôs changed pronouns when he addresses me. He‚Äôs supportive of my change of dress, and offered to buy me new clothes. However, he insists i hold on to some of my girlier clothes ‚Äújust in case‚Äù, and he keeps telling me that he doesn‚Äôt want me to have surgery because ‚Äúwhat if you regret it?‚Äù.

I have never been happy with my body until now, that I realize I have the ability to change things I don‚Äôt like.

2021-03-28 02:01:18,mes4s5,0,1,"here's an attempt at explaining in the most accurate way how I see my internal self when it comes to gender identity

I'm transmasculine nonbinary and use they/them. My gender is NOT right in the middle of male and female if they were on a line. But it's equally far away from each. Just not on that line.

Some nonbinary people might describe their gender as something on a fully different plane - 3 dimensions! But I think mine is still on that original plane. Beyond that 1 dimensional line, but on the same plane. On some level, my gender only reveals up to two dimensions.

So going back to that male to female line - take the midpoint of that. Draw a line perpendicular to that.

That point is the single point that connects a complex fractal to that specific plane that holds the binary genders. Nearly the entirety of the fractal is on different planes besides that one point. Set that fractal, excluding the lemon yellow point, to 20% opacity.

2021-03-28 13:48:24,mf15fv,16,1,"Hey y'all. I've been thinking about this for a while and I'm not sure if I'm onto something or misunderstanding the meaning of gender identity. I'd like to find more scholarly articles or books about this and haven't been super successful so far. 

About me and where I'm coming from: I'm afab, in my 30s, ace, and married. I'm not interested in parenthood and very disinterested in pregnancy and other aspects of motherhood; I'm more inclined to adopt if my feelings were to change in the future. I had an isolating adolescence in which I was raised on the internet and no one really paid me any mind or ever pushed back on anything I did or my interests. When I was younger I rejected femininity in that way that a lot of girls do out of the misguided notion of being ""not like the other girls,"" but have since matured and grown out of it. I prefer the gender neutral to femme in fashion and behavior and other forms of gender expression. 


Here's what I'm curious about:
The dialogue on gender and feminism has exploded in recent decades, women are freer to live their lives on their own terms more than ever before. In the history of gender politics, women have long been in an oppressed and supportive role relative to men, but that is changing in our society. Women aren't resigned to being wives and mothers, they are able to pursue careers, marry or not marry whomever they please, have or not have children, etc etc. This is incredibly simplified and there is still a lot of work to do to work towards a truly egalitarian society, but the work has been started. In general in polite society women have more freedom to shake off the shackles that traditional femininity has confined her to. 

If women are moving away from the traditionally feminine, what does it mean to be a woman in modern society?

I started questioning my own gender identity about a year ago and put it on a shelf for a while, figuring that the umbrella for women is large enough to encompass my gender nonconforming self, so why shake the boat? I started wearing more sports bras and enjoying the feeling of understating my femininity, but I'm not uncomfortable with my pronouns or being viewed as a woman, but it also didn't quite fit me. I feel more in common with the queer community than with cis women, or could that just be more of the old ""not like other girls"" misogyny? 

Under the umbrella of womanhood, I imagine that the most femme are closest to the center with more nonconforming expression trending towards the edges. Now I'm considering whether there could be another,  nonbinary umbrella overlapping with the womanhood umbrella to encompass those who do not identify with those in the center. 

As nonbinary becomes more mainstream, could we see more women who had previously identified as tomboys, butch, gender nonconforming etc identify this way? This is a concept that has always existed but has only just recently had a word for it with all of the community support that comes with identifying an idea like this. 

Am I on the right track with this, or am I misunderstanding something important about gender identity? In most trans narratives there is dysphoria and a distinct feeling of being in the wrong body, but how does it work with nonbinary people who are not in the wrong body, per se, but feel unsupported and unrepresented by the gender binary? The last thing I would want to do is a kind of gender appropriation and take away from members of the community who need the most support.

2021-03-29 07:26:19,mfk2fj,16,1,"Hey Guys! I'm pretty knew to this subreddit and also this is my first post (and English isn't my mothertongue so please be easy on me)

I just recently am thinking about this because there are some things that bother me a lot.

First of all, I was born a girl and always thought of myself as one, just because I never saw the possibility in being anything else than a girl. With about 13 I first learned that LGBTQ+ is a thing and I pretty fast discovered that I like girls too. Later I learned about nonbinary. It was hard for me to understand it at first but I got it pretty quickly. Nowadays I am actually panromantic, cause I like personality, not gender.

Now to my problem.
At the moment I work in First Level Support for a Tech Company and I answer calls. I had a call where a customer said ""Oh I got a young lady today, normally I get young men"".
And that bothered me. A lot. I don't know what exactly... just the assumption that I am a woman? Or just my brain that instantly went like: why the f does my gender matter?

Since then, the thought of my gender bothers me a lot. Or the thought of gender in general. I thought about what gender really meant to me. Because neither the things you like nor the things you wear should be gendered. They kinda are because of society and I also catch myself thinking: what cute girl or what a cute boy, even if I cannot possibly know the person's gender (idk just what society taught my head and what bothers me now)

Also names are kinda pointlessly gendered. Who decided that e.g. Sarah is a girl's name and John is a guy's name? Why not the other way around?

Also, physical appearance doesn't really tell your gender.

And what's in your pants? I don't know, it kinda does tell your gender but also doesn't.

So to break it all down, it's basically just pronouns and feelings (at least for me)

And yeah, now I am totally confused about my own gender.

I know I gotta figure out my gender myself but maybe you could tell me how you discovered being nonbinary. Maybe you could give me some advice.

2021-03-31 05:05:28,mgynzw,2,1,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a straight 19 year old AMAB. I have no one to speak to about this and I really need to just get it off of my chest. It‚Äôs a bit long but if you want to read it and give me your opinion I would appreciate it very much. 

Trigger/sensitive content warning

Sorry if I don‚Äôt say this very well I‚Äôm not exactly sure what I‚Äôm trying to ask. 

Before I hit puberty I never questioned my gender. When I hit puberty though I started to become uncomfortable with certain aspects of my body. I resented my body hair, facial hair, and my deep voice. Idk why but these things make me feel so weird and gross sometimes. Despite feeling this way I never even thought it was remotely possible that I might be questioning my gender. It never even crossed my mind that there may be a possibility that I‚Äôm not cis. 

Anyway about a year ago I started experiencing some serious gender dysphoria for the first time. This was caused by me asking myself the question: that if by some supernatural event I was able to change my sex, would I? I realized that I would. I realized that if I had a choice to start over I would 100% without question do it as a female and this kinda messed me up. I lost control and just completely broke down crying over the fact that I‚Äôm AMAB and wanted to be AFAB so fucking badly. This was the first time I‚Äôve ever had any thoughts like this.

Since then I‚Äôve had a few more episodes like this. This has caused me to discover my femininity which had been suppressed for basically my whole life. I started removing all of my body hair and experimenting with some women‚Äôs clothes which made me feel total euphoria. I‚Äôve started to just act more feminine overall.

Right now I feel that while I would choose to be AFAB if by a miracle I was given the option, I don‚Äôt think I would want to fully transition to the female gender. I have tremendous respect for people who do but I just feel like it wouldn‚Äôt be for me. I don‚Äôt always feel like I want to be a female. Like sure I don‚Äôt like my body hair but that can be solved pretty easily. I also have the ability to speak with a higher voice. 

This led me to discover what it means to be non binary and it‚Äôs interested me quite a bit. I find a strange but calming comfort in the thought that I could be outside of the traditional male-female binary or in between them. The thought that someone might be confused about what gender I am makes me feel so euphoric fr. I even picked a gender neutral name for myself and I‚Äôve really gotten into androgynous fashion as well. I‚Äôm very grateful to have a slender body without many prominent masculine features so I hope this would be something I could pull off if I wanted to.

Anyway I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I don‚Äôt think a cis person would be thinking like this right? I‚Äôm just really conflicted as to whether I‚Äôm actually non binary or cis. I‚Äôve heard so many stories of non binary people feeling confusion about their gender at a young age. Could I still be non binary if I only started experiencing this when I was older? 

Also, if I was non binary I don‚Äôt even know if I could come out. I really have absolutely no idea how I would. I‚Äôm lucky to have loving and supporting parents but they don‚Äôt even know what non binary is. I don‚Äôt think they even know gender is different from sex. My family isn‚Äôt socially conservative but they are just very traditional in a sense and don‚Äôt have much exposure to these kinds of things. 

Would I even be taken seriously since I wouldn‚Äôt be committing to a gender? I don‚Äôt know how to express it. Like when people transition from MtF for example they might say they always knew deep down they were the other gender. I didn‚Äôt though so in this case what reasoning do I even give? What‚Äôs my justification? My entire life I‚Äôve appeared as a comfortable cis male and never gave anyone a reason to think otherwise. Idk maybe I‚Äôm just living in a fantasy world.

I also have the ability to speak with a higher voice. \n\nThis led me to discover what it means to be non binary and it‚Äôs interested me quite a bit. I find a strange but calming comfort in the thought that I could be outside of the traditional male-female binary or in between them. The thought that someone might be confused about what gender I am makes me feel so euphoric fr. I even picked a gender neutral name for myself and I‚Äôve really gotten into androgynous fashion as well. I‚Äôm very grateful to have a slender body without many prominent masculine features so I hope this would be something I could pull off if I wanted to.\n\nAnyway I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I don‚Äôt think a cis person would be thinking like this right? I‚Äôm just really conflicted as to whether I‚Äôm actually non binary or cis. I‚Äôve heard so many stories of non binary people feeling confusion about their gender at a young age. Could I still be non binary if I only started experiencing this when I was older? \n\nAlso, if I was non binary I don‚Äôt even know if I could come out. I really have absolutely no idea how I would. I‚Äôm lucky to have loving and supporting parents but they don‚Äôt even know what non binary is. I don‚Äôt think they even know gender is different from sex. My family isn‚Äôt socially conservative but they are just very traditional in a sense and don‚Äôt have much exposure to these kinds of things. \n\nWould I even be taken seriously since I wouldn‚Äôt be committing to a gender? I don‚Äôt know how to express it. Like when people transition from MtF for example they might say they always knew deep down they were the other gender. I didn‚Äôt though so in this case what reasoning do I even give? What‚Äôs my justification? My entire life I‚Äôve appeared as a comfortable cis male and never gave anyone a reason to think otherwise. Idk maybe I‚Äôm just living in a fantasy world.\n\nIf you made it this far I really thank you for just listening to me. Even typing this out has made me feel a bit better. I would really appreciate your opinion please thanks.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'I‚Äôm so confused please help', 'created': 1617192328.0}"
