Example of gender euphoria for me are:

* **Shaving my head every month!** I actually kinda like my face now and there's something very freeing about not having hair. Also the only hair I shave on my body is my head, so it feels kinda like a fuck you to society.
* **Wearing big, billowy, tunic-like dresses.** In my head their androgynous/genderless lol, or at least I feel that way when I wear them. Also known as toddler-fashion.
* **Being in nature**: going on a walk and feeling the sun and wind is another way for me to enjoy my body when it is often hard to. It's a sensory experience that grounds me and reminds me of all the nice things my body does for me and allows me to experience even if i'm sometimes at war with it or detached from it.
* **Listening to music and dancing!** The right song will make me super unselfconscious of my body and I can just exist and be free! Goofy, odd dancing is genderless, I tell ya. Also bonus points if I can pretend like i'm in a music video if I go on a walk while listening to music.
* **Playing in makeup**: maybe unconventional as an AFAB, but playing around and doing strange or otherworldly makeup looks is a lot of fun. A lot of gender euphoria for me is allowing myself to act and be like a kid again, because I feel like when I was super young I could just exist and not worry to much about performing this or that gender. 
* **As a fat enby, finding masc clothes that actually fit my body well and give it the silhouette I want**: there's always the duality of having to find clothes that fit and are tailored well to my body as a fat person, and also not exclusively feminine (since there's often pressure for fat AFAB's to be hyperfeminine and so clothes are oriented that way).

Hey friends! I wanted to check in and let you all know about my progress on low dose T. I posted a link to my 1 week update in case anyone wants to start there. So far not a lot of changes since my first post. 

Mental: I talked about how great it feels to have a better mind/body connection and I still feel that way but something strange happened at the beginning of week 2; my anxiety skyrocketed for a few days. I think it was a combo of extra energy on T/new feelings of being present in real time. I feel like even though I didn’t enjoy how things were pre-T I still had a safety net and knew what to expect. I’ve always been one to think 12 steps ahead just so I can prepare myself for every outcome, almost to the point of being able to predict things that will happen. When I started T I didn’t feel the need to be “on” all the time and that realization came with me having to find a new baseline. I didn’t feel the need to obsess over what was going to happen and my anxiety made me believe that the fact I didn’t feel the need to obsess was wrong somehow(the human mind is so bizarre) but I guess we are creatures of habit; even if those habits harm us. After I processed what was happening and also cut down on my caffeine intake I was able to become clear headed again. I still have moments of panic and feeling like things are surreal but this is a journey and there will be many bumps along the road. I’m willing to deal with those bumps because I finally feel like I’m headed in the right direction. 

Physical: Things are still uber slow on this front and I’m okay with that. I think if physical changes happened too fast my anxiety would ramp up more. My body hair is getting slightly longer on my arms but still light in color. I have more hair on my upper thighs but very patchy. I can tell I’m getting more muscle definition and I feel stronger. Last Friday I had horrible leg pain that felt similar to growing pains when I was a kid. I read that ligaments and tendons change when T is introduced so I’m thinking that was the reason. I was able to control it with Advil. Skin changes are the same, just a bit more oily and a few pimples. Bottom growth continues to happen but not terribly noticeable. My smell seems to be changing. I have less overall body softness/fat.

I guess my question is this what’s the gender neutral for bachelorette/bachelor party? What is the neutral for bridesmaid/groomsmen? What is the gender neutral for fiancé? And would that double as the neutral for bride/groom?—(I’ve seen this earlier in the thread of conversation but I never felt a clear consensus was gathered) what kind of wedding activities can we do rather than some of the very overtly sexualized and gendered activities?

Hello,

Let’s see. So I work in education as an occupational therapy practitioner, and I’m non-binary. I started coming out earlier this year and it went great. Teachers have been super respectful and inclusive. Everyone started with the switch from Ms. to Mx. I was thrilled to finally feel myself. A principal asked me when I first announced my arrival what my expectations were and told me not to put a demand on the students. I completely understood as a lot of students I support haven’t grasped he-she. So fine whatever. I was hoping that as time went on they would hear my pronouns and either ask or just continue to be exposed without the direct addressing. Now I’m wondering how to I go about teachers using my pronouns. I’ve kind of let it slide because correcting people in front of other people and in front of children seems inappropriate to me.

Hi there! I think this is my first time writing here. I needed a safe place to just rant a bit and I hope I don’t bother anyone. 

I’m an Italian aroace activist. I’ve been out as non binary with my followers for three months now and since January 6th I’ve decided to use she/they/he pronouns without preference. 
I’m not here ti talk about politics or activism, but it’s obvious that my position exposes me to a lot of queerphobia of any kind. 

I’m at a difficult moment in life (work and personal stuff) and today a group of terfs decided to take on me all their transphobic and aphobic comments. 
They usually don’t bother me that much. I am privileged enough to have people to reach to when I am upset, friends and partners that will always have my back and that I’m out to. 
But! Today it was especially difficult to stop thinking about the comments (that for your mental safety I will avoid repeating) and I just needed to talk about it with you, my own nb community. 

And idk who needs to hear this, but I will remind you and myself that it’s okay to feel bad when people use our identity to discriminate us and invalidate our opinions. It’s okay to be upset, angry, sad, and have all the negative emotions. Just remember that there’s people out there (and out here) who understands and accepts you for who you are. 

I love my nb partner, friends and sibiling. And I love you. I love my nb community and I love that thanks to all of you I got to understand who I am and that there’s nothing wrong with me being who I am. And this is valid for all of you too. 

And it’s okay to not be able to take our shit together when bad things happen. It’s okay to mourn and grief when we are attacked and when we feel invalidated for who we are. 

And it’s okay to do nothing about it, if we don’t feel like it. Action is not mandatory. It only is if it’s safe for us, for our physical, mental and emotional health.

2021-02-08 21:44:38,lfmqas,2,1,"Hello all, sorry in advance if this is a bit scattered and rambly, I just have a lot of thoughts..

So I have been identifying as genderfluid for many years now, and have been perfectly happy with that label, as I know for a fact that I have always been somewhere on the gender spectrum that definitely isn't cis, and this was what I think fits best

However, lately I've been having a lot of conflicting feelings about it, and what exactly I should classify myself as..
and I wanted to maybe see if anyone here has had the same sort of thing happen to them

Recently I just haven't felt like any label is fitting anymore..
Like genderfluid I've always liked, because I don't always feel like one gender, some days ill feel like wearing my binder and contouring my face to look a bit more masculine, and other days ill wear a dress and feel great just because it's what I think I look nice in
(And like half the time I wear a dress or a skirt ill wear a binder too)

I also considered the fact that I might be trans 
As don't really like referring to myself as a lady even when I dress and feel more feminine on a given day, but even then, I don't really have the type of dysphoria that makes me feel like I'm 100% a guy either,  like I wear my binder a lot and want short hair, but otherwise I don't feel an overwhelming feeling telling me im one or the other, but a majority of the time I just don't like being referred to as simply a woman

Like I've never minded being called ""she"".. because the thing is, I'm normally comfortable with any pronouns at all
like my friends mostly call me ""she"" which is whatever,  its fine, and one trans/nb friend of mine goes out of their way to call me ""they"", which I actually found i really like
And when on occasion I have been called ""he"" (or sir at work when someone only saw me from behind) I feel fantastic about it

And like, I feel like the reason I don't ask people to stop calling me she all together, even though its not always terrible to hear, it's that I don't want to inconvenience them? Like I know that everyone would be super supportive and everything, but I almost feel guilty for some reason even though I shouldn't..

And my name is even pretty unisex, so I don't feel like thats an issue either

To be honest I'd rather not be perceived as anything but a cryptic void haha no pronouns, no gender, only incomprehensible shrieking omg

And thats the thing, I just don't feel like I'm wavering between male presenting and female presenting, I feel like for the last year or so I'm just.. sort of vaguely gesturing to the gender spectrum going yep in in there somewhere
Like I dress however I want, and I love my body even when I'm not wearing my binder, but when I look at myself I don't know what to call myself anymore

And like I said, part of me worries that I'm not committing to one label or the other because I worry about bothering everyone in my life with worrying about if they are using the right pronouns or not
One of my friends often asks me if im sure I don't want her to call me something different, but I always just say oh no its okay I'm happy with whatever
But now idk

And plus I have a 9 year old step sister who only knows me as her sister and idek what I'd tell her.. though she's a good kid who'd probably understand but idk 


And for awhile now anytime I'm alone with my thoughts I've just been considering this whole thing, and I just get this weird weight in my chest like I know there's something more to it and I just need to find the right answer to feel comfortable, but I'm not sure...

And the point of all of this is obviously considering which sub I'm on, that I'm really wondering if I'd actually be more comfortable identifying as nonbinary

The best way to describe our current relationship is “it’s complicated” as we are still very close friends and have a sexual relationship, but no more romance. Anyway, I told him I was non-binary back in august and he completely shot me down. He said that the only reason I’d identify myself as such was due to the medications I was taking.

I'm an amab enby. Currently I look...obnoxiously male. I can just about pull of androgyny in heavily controlled above the neck selfies from a high angle, but existing day-to-day as a person I despise who appears in the mirror.

I want to look more androgynous, more ""mistakable."" I want to be almost *ungenderable* for the average stranger on sight almost completely independently of what I wear, and I want to be able to ""crossplay"" (cosplay female characters)

Searching ""how to look androgynous"" on YouTube and Google brings up results largely aimed at afab people, and even then usually focusing largely on clothing and whatnot.

So I'm hoping not just for simple bits of advice, though those are of course more than welcome, but someone willing to at least attempt to actively  guide me through a journey to as close to that ungenderable androgyny as possible.

Currently I own a corset I don't know how to even wear, lipstick that doesn't fit me because I have thin lips, special ""hair powder"" to make my hair more floofy for when I eventually get the hairstyle I want **_but don't know the first thing about achieving,_** and makeup brushes for makeup I don't own and would have no idea how to use anyway.

I know that weight loss, at least for me, will be a major part of achieving androgyny as well.

Please somebody be willing to help an amab nonbinary individual who wants to stop being terrified of mirrors.

I'm literally in the middle of a mental breakdown. I wanna punch everything, yell, cry... I basically cried myself to sleep last night, cause my mind wouldn't stop. 

I'm amab, still figuring out exactly where I fall in that spectrum, somewhere close to the fem side. Currently married for less than a year, but the relationship is 9 years in. I came out to my now wife as asexual as few years ago and she took that in stride, didnt really change anything, or so I thought. A little while after that, I found out she was emotionally cheating on me through Tumblr, having explicit sexual conversations with men, with some of them sending her naked pictures. She never reciprocated the pictures. I confronted her about that and it stopped. 

Now let's fast forward some years.
Last year, I really started questioning my gender. Being a man never felt right, and I've been uncomfortable in my body for my entire existence. Bouts of anorexia, self harm, you name it. No one ever really talked about transgender people when I was growing up, but I now know that I am trans. 

It took me a bit, but I did come out to my wife, and she said she accepts me for who I am. However, I felt that even though she was accepting, she wasnt happy. I asked he about how she felt and basically got a non-response back. It hurt, a lot. I bought myself some fem clothes, that ended up being way to big for me (queue dysphoria breakdown). I gave the clothes to my wife and she was a little weird about me buying them originally for myself. We talked about it, and it seemed okay. Seemed okay. I've never felt that shes accepting of who I am, or who I want to be. 

A few months ago, before I came out to her, I found out that she was in Tumblr again, having explicit conversations with men. Granted, our sex life did falter quite a bit, but I've told her I'm always willing whenever she wants (shes never taken me up on that). So that hurt, a lot. I didnt do anything about it immediately. Instead, I started trying to be a better spouse. Give her my time and attention, listen, clean without being asked, all the things. Even more intimacy with cuddles. Now heres the kicker: most of the times I initiated sex, she'd say no, with whatever reason. Cool, I'm okay with that. I'm not okay when you say no to me and then the next day you're on Tumblr with these men, masturbating!
I gave her the opportunity to stop, by being sneaky and rebloging porn (she has a porn blog), liking pictures. She didnt stop, and it even got more intense. Eventually I changed her profile to mention she was married (as it has said single before), and one of the men asked her about it.
She went nuclear. Deleted all the conversations (that I have screenshots of).
She now knows I'm aware of the cheating, and she sent me ""I'm sorry for all the pain I have caused you"". Like... it's my fault you cheated? I cant get this out of my head. 

I cant focus in anything anymore. My head is constantly spinning. 

I'm questioning whether I'm trans. Am I faking it? I dont want to be a man, but my penis is okay, testicles not so much. Boobs would be cool, but not if they got big?, if my wife even wants to be with me anymore... I'm trying to leave my job too.... Nothing ever seems to go right for me.
I'm so frustrated and exhausted. I cant even begin to explain how I feel, I only know I really dont like feeling this way and would so much rather just disappear or die or something.

I also started taking a liking to looking like male musicians I listen to, then a liking to looking androgynous. The idea of it, makes me feel like I would be happy to look androgynous, but I also think I like looking feminine, sometimes.

I am not happy in the body I’m in, just generally. I don’t mind it, but the fact i have a bit of curves that take away from my possibility of looking androgynous, does slightly make me a bit sad at times.

I asked a close friend, who’s trans (mtf) to refer to me as she/they, I asked her to describe me in 3rd person as she/they, and man it felt good when she called me they.

Hope this post finds a home here &amp; I'm glad I found this place, I could use some support. The regular nonbinary sub seems to be just selfies. No harm in that! But it's nice to talk. 

Disclaimer: I get most people here are those who may just be figuring out they're trans/nonbinary, coming out, starting transition, etc. With that said, please do not be scared off by anything I say. Do what feels best for you and makes you happiest. You deserve it.

Also, for any gender critical ""feminists"" who may be lurking so they can post screenshots in their shitty little Facebook groups, I do NOT regret any part of my transition. It was the best thing I could've done for myself.

Anyways, on with the post.

My transition wasn't on a whim. I had years to think about it before it actually happened, and I was pretty certain about my identity and sense of self. In a way, I was right; I am trans. But I was certain I was the binary gender opposite of my ASAB (out of my own personal spite for anything binary, I am not going to reveal it, also I feel it's just irrelevant honestly). I knew being nonbinary was a thing, but I didn't identify with it at the time. I started taking hormones (which I'm still on and have no plans to discontinue), had affirming surgery, and so forth. For a long time, I've been living as a binary trans person who consistently passed.

Something changed these past few years, though. I began to feel disillusioned with living as my transitioned gender. It was lightyears better than living as my assigned gender, don't get me wrong. But something didn't feel right. I decided to present more gender non-conforming, which helped, and it even got to the point where I was able to look androgynous/sometimes pass as my ASAB despite years of medical transition. But looking androgynous wasn't good enough to make it feel like my gender expression and identity truly ""fit"".

And only recently has it clicked with me. I hate the fact that ""androgynous"" is the best I'll ever get. I don't want to look inbetween male and female, I don't want to be ambiguous, I don't want to come off as ""confusing"", I want to be interpreted as someone who's apart of an entirely separate gender that isn't male or female. I want people to be able to take one look at me and be able understand that, just as they're able to tell if someone's a man or a woman right off the bat.

When I first started transitioning as a binary trans person, I was over the moon when strangers began correctly gendering me and I consistently passed. I will never have that experience as someone who is non-binary. I have rarely ever had anyone default to calling me they/them, and if they do it's out of politeness over not being able to tell whether I'm male or female and not wanting to offend, switching to binary pronouns when they hear someone else refer to me with those pronouns. 

I will never have the privilege of going stealth as a non-binary person. If anyone knows I go by they/them or don't want to be viewed as male or female, it's an automatic outing as being trans. That's not even so much bad for myself as it is for the people in my life. My family would have to explain that yes, ""they/them"" is actually referring to one person, who is nonbinary. And now whoever they're talking to automatically knows my family member is associated with a trans person. It adds such unnecessary stigma.

Even that being said, I can't come out to anyone because if I tell people I don't want to be my transitioned gender anymore, they'll interpret it as me regretting my transition and wanting to go back. It took forever for my family to start using the proper binary pronouns, and one of my parents assumed that I wanted to be my ASAB again when I became less gender conforming.

The world itself is just so fucking binary. Hormone wise, we basically have to choose between testosterone and estrogen as the dominant hormone. I'm not a fan of either, but the only other choice is blockers which has its own drawbacks. I wish there was a third option, but I'm stuck with what's the lesser of two evils for me, and that's only because it's the one opposite of my ASAB.

2021-02-10 20:03:55,lh2eka,2,1,"So I have no plans of dating until covid is over, and I've figured myself out better. Right now I know I'm not really in a good enough place mental health wise to be in a relationship. I'm primarily attracted to women, and maybe other enbies? I don't really know any personally but wouldn't be against trying a relationship with one. My biggest fear with dating comes down to insecurities revolving around my body and primarily my penis. I feel like the culture around rideculing men with small penises has left an insecurity on me that stayed with me even after realizing I'm not a man. I know love, and fulfilling sex are possible without using a penis at all. And honestly, I wouldn't be upset if I didn't have to use mine, I really prefer other parts of sex then penatrative sex. I guess I'm just curious about people being a little more body positive and accepting when dating as an enby.

I'm open to hearing anyone's opinions on the matter as well as any recommendations you have for helping me to feel more confident as I am.

I know love, and fulfilling sex are possible without using a penis at all. And honestly, I wouldn't be upset if I didn't have to use mine, I really prefer other parts of sex then penatrative sex.

I enjoy dresses and a more feminine appearance, I am currently thinking of including more masculine or androgynous ways of expressing myself.However I’m concerned that by presenting in a typically feminine way while identifying as nonbinary I create a negative stigma of nonbinary not being seen as valid, however if I was AMAB this wouldn’t be such of an inner conflict.

I agree that I don’t owe people androgyny just for identifying as nonbinary.

I was wondering what proportion of you consider yourself neurodivergent or have been diagnosed officially. Probably the two areas of life that I get most consistently gaslighted or denied are in accessing help for gender issues or aspects of attention disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm friends with some very stereotypical ADHD cases (white, male, hyperactive, easily distracted) and I'm aware that women with ADHD are often looked over, but I feel like the farther away from the gender binary it gets, the worse visibility is.

It frustrates me because our brains are so cool! So many good thoughts in there!! I want to know them all! I want to relate to other people's experiences and know I'm not the only one.

Side note: I've been hyperfixating on the topology of people's mental landscapes. If you want (to waste some time), I'd love more answers to these questions, or anything in a similar vein:

\- Is there a setting in your head? A visual location where things occur like a beach or forest or dimensionless void.

\- How many entities are in your head? Some have just one! Some have many!

\- Is your body a different entity than your mind or brain?

\- Do you have a different voice, self image, etc in your mind? Are there many different visages?

\- Are your thoughts more related to the impression of sound, images, text, emotion..?

\- What does your thought process look like?

\- Does your brain ever just stop/freeze until you poke it to restart?

2021-02-11 23:02:56,lhxdzz,11,1,"hey everyone, 
I‘m sorry if this is not the right place for my question, i just needed to talk about this to someone and i figured maybe someone could help me out here. 

so here’s a few things about me, i’ll try to make it short: 
I‘m 20, born female and I have been extremely confused about my identity for about 5 years now. 
I thought I was nonbinary for a while, then i thought i was ftm, then I just went back to identifying as a woman and tried to ignore all of it (i’ve never transitioned or outed myself tho). 
The confusing thing is, sometimes the whole gender thing is all I can think about, my gender makes me horribly uncomfortable and I feel dysphoric. Then there are times when I am relatively okay with it or even feel empowered, when I am in a group of girls for example. 
Some days I want to cut off my breasts, I imagine myself as more masculine, I want to cry when i see my female shape in the mirror and see my breasts and my thighs. Being called a woman or female pronouns makes me flinch, I reject everything that reminds me of my gender and dream about my ideal self, which would be looking androgynous/ masculine, having short hair, a thin, rather male shape and no breasts. On those days I feel like I am trans, and I can relate so much to the trans experience. 
But then at other times I don’t feel that dysphoria, I will wear makeup, do my hair and wear a skirt and feel feminine, and then I also like being treated like a girl. I feel strongly about feminism too and I feel this kind of solidarity and connectedness towards other women. 
In the very few relationships I had with guys, I also liked it when they treated me as a woman, especially in a sexual context. 
I should mention that I am bisexual, which makes it even more confusing to me, because I really like women and I cannot figure out if I want to be like them or just appreciate their beauty. But i’ve never truly felt like one of them, and I wish I knew why. 
I was also anorexic for some time in the past and have never had a positive body image. 
My doctor said I have too much androgens (testosterone), it will be examined soon. Maybe this has something to do with my dysphoria? 
How can I figure this out? Do I just want to be someone else and escape reality? Could I actually be nonbinary, or trans? 
I have tried to fit in and adapt myself my whole life (I was bullied as a child), and I am so out of touch with my identity and myself that I have no idea who I am inside. 
I tried to suppress  this and learn to love my body the last couple years, but these thoughts are just coming back and the dysphoria gets worse the more I let those thoughts become conscious. 
I would be very thankful for any answers, and I can answer more questions of course.

My next required steps include submitting 2-3 letters of recommendation from a teacher, advisor, or someone I know.

&amp;#x200B;

The scholarship organization tells me "" **Given the transition to submission directly on CommunityForce, it is** **Point’s strong preference that all letters be uploaded directly to the site by the semifinalist or, if you wish to share your login information, by the letter writer. As such, please try to select letter writers for whom privacy will not be an issue.**"" So, in other words, my scholarship not only allows me but strongly encourages me to upload \*myself\* the letter of recommendation as a pdf to my account application. This works out for me great since I'm not out to anyone at school, especially the main teachers I want letters from (they've already written letters for me in the past for college).

However, there are two other options besides me personally uploading my letter of rec. First, I can share my account info with the recommender and then the recommender (teacher) can login to my account, and then upload their letter there. The problem with this is that I'm not out to anyone, and when you login to my account, you can see all my personal information, such as my gender identity (nonbinary), pronouns (she and they), sexual orientation (bi), and preferred name (which isn't the one they know me as). And so by allowing them to login, they're probably going to see that information.

The Second other option is my teacher can email the scholarship organization and request for permission to electronically email their letter themselves to the scholarship email. The problem with this method is that the scholarship organization strongly prefers the applicant to upload the letter themselves, and strongly suggests that this second other option is only used as a last resort.

I, being the active human I am, stood up and said, ""but there's more than two genders.""  That sparked a HUGE argument, and resulted in shouting.

There are a lot of things about my body that I struggle with and that bring me a lot of dysphoria, but my chest is definitely the biggest one. I don’t wear bras, I would rather be violently ill then wear something with cups, but to give you an idea my size would be a C. Not humongous but definitely extremely noticeable even with multiple sports bras. I have to bind to look even remotely flat. In fact, I know it’s just in my head, but even when I’m binding I feel like I still look like I have an A cup. All of this is to say, being out anywhere without a binder on makes me want to cry. 

Anyway, this wasn’t really an issue for me before. I just graduated school, but I did so online, and I only worked part time because i couldn’t do full time plus school. That meant I was able to be extremely cautious and bind correctly. I would only bind while working, which was like, 4-6 hours shifts, maybe 4 times a week. Occasionally I would bind if I was going out and doing something but not if I had already worked that day. 

That being said, now that I have graduated I just got hired for a full time position. I will be working 8/8.5 hour shifts 5 days a week, and I have a 40 minute commute. So even if I put on my binder right before leaving and took it off as soon as I got home, I would be binding at least 10 hours a day 5 days a week. Which I know is not good and can cause a lot of damage. Especially because I 100% plan on getting top surgery AS SOON as I can save up the money (but that will probably be years because living is expensive) and I know binding incorrectly can damage your chest tissue to the point of disqualifying you from getting the surgery. 

All of this a long winded way of asking, what can I do about this? I don’t want to hurt my body and I DEFINITELY don’t want to screw up my chances of getting a procedure to correct something that literally causes me distress every day of my life. But not binding at work is just, not an option for me. 

I have considered putting my binder on/taking it off in the car at work and not wearing it during my commute. But not only would that be difficult to figure out, but it still wouldn’t be good to bind for a full 8.5 hour shift 5 days a week. I also saw a YouTuber talking about how he cut the side of his binder and attached Velcro so he could easily open it up for a break. But I’m scared that if I mess with a binder it won’t work as well and I will just waste it. 

Does anyone have any tips/ideas? I have a gc2b binder, so it’s really nice quality. I measured everything out and rounded up so it fits nicely and hasn’t ever caused me any kind of pain. The instructions that came with it say not to bind more than 8-10 hours a day and to take at least 2 days a week off. So technically I would still be within the recommended use, especially if I don’t wear the binder for the commute. But despite what the tag says, I know binding that much still isn’t good.

In all my longer, more serious relationships I have experienced loss of libido after 1-2 years (with no correlation to loss of love or other relational problems). I've mostly related this to me being on SSRI for about 25 years, since it's a common side effect. I've also thought that I might just be periodically asexual. But realizing more and more about my gender dysphoria through life made me start to think that this pattern might rather be a sign of dysphoria (or a mix of it all of course).

The core of my gender identity has always been that I'm NOT a woman (but AFAB). For the most part of my life (I'm 43) I've felt like agender, but the latest 4-5 years non-binary transmasc is a more accurate label. 

My relationships have all been with cis-hetero males. I have always declared something like ""I don't see myself as a woman"", but haven't had an indepth discussion about gender identity with my partners (tried with the last one, but he clearly didn't understand). I haven't tried to act more girly to please my partners or something like that, but I've always been very conscious of the fact that my partners considered me as a woman/their girlfriend. Maybe even more so in sexual context.

I felt that souls don't have a gender, so accepted a genderless part of my being, while also accepting my male body as well as both ""masculine and feminine"" traits.  I stopped caring what society gendered my actions as and just did what I wanted.  I grew my hair long and have embraced certain qualities that many may view as feminine or gay.  I have close friends affectionately call me a ""prancing lesbian"" and we all feel it's somehow accurate without really knowing what it means.  My name is Daniel and as long as I can remember people call me Danielle (which is not even feminine in french, to which I was quite exposed) and it never bothers me. I am sometimes mistaken for a woman with my hair and it doesn't bother me.  It doesn't bother me too much what people call me or interpret me as, but I just don't feel ""male"".  I really don't like being told I should act or look a certain way because I am XY.  I definitely have a muscular male body, but with a bigger butt and back than biceps/chest.  I like to wear spandex in the gym, I think I confused a lot of people as I was going with my female partner and they don't understand why a ""straight"" man would wear spandex.  

After starting to grow my hair and embrace these qualities I met my partner who i was together with for the last 8 years.  Some of these qualities clashed with my ex-partner who wanted me to cut my hair and be more ""manly"".  Ironically my partner had many masculine characteristics like dominance and a jacked physique.  She has even gone from having long feminine hair to cutting it to shorter.  She could definitely pass as a butch lesbian making it a bit shorter, especially with how dominant she is (also bi).  But at the same time she was pushing me to be a gender conforming male so we can get married and have kids according to her parents wishes.  She is caught between an extremely conservative muslim family and her free self expression.  We started three start ups so have been working non-stop for three years and it destroyed our relationship.  Anyways, the relationship has been ending slowly over the past year and we are finally seeing the light in the work tunnel, so now I feel like I can explore a more true expression of myself.  I love my body and my masculine and feminine qualities.  I am not sure if I am NB at this point, but don't really feel like a ""man"".

I'm AMAB and still feel pretty comfortable with he/him pronouns and feel no dysphoria or discomfort with my body though, and mostly am happy presenting masc (though I think to some extent that might be internalized transphobia thinking I wouldn't look good in femme clothing with my masc body). I'm also not sure if being referred to with they/them would give me the euphoric feeling I've heard other nonbinary people talk about, or if its just another set of pronouns I'm okay with being referred to with.

Now I'm starting to wonder if I've been using my comfort with my AGAB to not really think about gender. 

I guess in essence I'm wondering if its still a nonbinary experience to feel comfortable with your body and AGAB (which conform with society's gender norms), but also feel comfortable with gender neutral pronouns and language, or if that's just me being comfortable with gender neutral language and disliking the gender binary as an institution?

2021-02-15 19:03:16,lkkgmh,0,1,"Beards have a strange place in western society, and many societies in general.  As a secondary male sex characteristics they are generally seen as a masculine trait, but also seem to have significant cultural and religious connotations.  People starting using shells or bones to tweeze hair supposedly starting 100,000 years ago, for reasons we don't really know, but probably for appearances, hygiene or culture.  Shaving started maybe 60,000 years ago with sharpened tools.

Historically shaving has come in and out of favor in various cultures for aesthetic purposes, but there are some major similarities to when there is a rule: religion, hierarchy and war.  Some monks in various religions will remove all hair on their head, while others cut nothing, I guess to please their gods.  Cutting someone's beard/hair was seen as an act of humiliation not subjugation, many slaves were forced to shave.  Finally in the military there are combat and hygiene advantages to shaving or cutting all head hair, and shaving has been enforced in some armies since antiquity.  For western culture beards and long hair went out of fashion after WWI and the rise of corporate culture.

Fast forward to today and shaving has become a common requirement for work in corporate culture, but seeing more changes in recent years.  Most men are forced to shave (probably to the dismay of many partners who enjoy beards!) and give up their self expression to get employment.  This seems like the subjugation and hierarchy portion of the shaving.  Men work as subordinates in a highly hierarchal structure.  Even CEOs answer to the boards who answer to shareholders.  The only people who don't have bosses in capitalism are shareholders.  So we have this exploitative capitalist system which is forcing men to shave (also cut hair short).  It signifies their submission to the corporate overlords.  It's ironic because it's also a requirement to cut all hair short usually, and seeing ""masculinity"" as being associated with short hair seems to stem from this corporate culture.  Another ironic thing is shaving as a step of manhood.  Now you have facial hair to differentiate you sexually from women and boys, but I'm gonna teach you to shave it off for the rest of your life!  Our culture is what dictates what we decide is ""manly"" or not.  Sikhs don't cut their hair at all for men!

Anyways, today for westerners, culturally, beards signify age/wisdom (wizard beards) for older men who are no longer in the workforce and don't need to submit.  For younger men they are associated with alternative lifestyles (hippies, dirtbags, hipsters) or independent rugged manliness (mountain man,  lumberjack etc).  If you're working in the woods, trades, etc you often don't need to shave and can find more independent work than corporate city culture.  I feel that corporate culture is for sure changing as the reigns of power move, but it's effect on our culture is still very significant.

How does the infatilizaition of cishet men affect their relationship with partners?  Many women complain that men are like children, well society is training them to be dependent on the hierarchy and change their physical characteristics to show their adherence to hierarchy.  Just another way capitalism tries to makes everyone conform and consume...

... personally, AMAB I haven't shaved in over 7 years.  I didn't have much desire to shave and my ex partner preferred me with a beard because I looked 17 clean shaven when I was 26, lol.  She also wanted me to cut my hair short, but that didn't happen as I get dysphoria from too short hair.  Anyways I have some woodwork to do that I want to wear a full respirator, so think I will shave for the first time in a long time.  Doubt I will become an everyday shaver, I used to shave every few weeks, just sort of that kind of lazy.

Most of my characters are either gay, lesbian, etc etc but it feels wrong to not include a massive part of the lgbtq+ community.

The context to their post was that they found thay they kept being corrected by progressive white people whenever they used 'Latino' (which in an of itself could be viewed as an issue re: white people policing how a marginalized group use their own language). That said, I always assumed that it was a gender neutral alternative to accommodate nonbinary people in an incredibly gendered language and do use it (and I'll use it in the rest of this post, but I can change it if I get responses in that vein!). I see it often used I'm liberal and progressive spaces. Because of the nature of the sub it was on, all the comments were primarily made up of cis people complaining about the term without mentioning nonbinary people at all, and also venting about gender neutral languages 'invading' their languages in general (including French people - there was a French person very upset about having to change the feminine language they used in their article on pregnancy and ranting about how French just *is* a binary gendered language and people should get over it). In fact the primary assumption seemed to be that the push for gender neutrality was to accommodate women because of how patriarchal a lot of gender languages are. And thay this push is 'whitewashed' or an oppressive invasion of white progressive values from the outside.

I know it sounds wrong to say “is” here, however in this context “they” is used in the singular so should it be “is” instead of “are”.

2021-02-18 10:58:28,lmk77q,3,1,"Hey everyone, sorry this is going to be another one of those 'am i non binary?' posts but I'm looking to get some advice on perspectives from others in the community about how I'm feeling.

I'm a 28 y.o. (feeling kinda late to the party!) AMAB who until recently has always identified as a cis gay male. I have over many years questioned my gender, although it is not something that has often been at the forefront of my mind or something I feel I have struggled with, I've definitely always felt that I am more than a cis male even though I don't feel I have experienced any feelings of body dysmorphia. I'm quite comfortable in my male body and with the fact that I am biologically male. 

On dysmorphia, I didn't think I'd suffered this at all but then maybe my constant questioning over the years, my frustration on many occasions where I've felt limited in how I present myself due to my male identity - are some form of gender dysphoria, as opposed to any dysphoria about my body? I'll often go out with friends wearing a lot of make up and I have some quite flamboyant pieces in my wardrobe but I have still always felt limited by my male identity.

So until now, despite all my questioning, I'd kind of just concluded that well I know I'm not trans so I must just be a guy, but it's never sat 100% right. Although non-binary is something I've been aware of for a long time it hasn't been until recently that I've actually taken some time to understand it more, I think I had dismissed it in terms of something that felt like me because I had always been under the impression that non-binary folk exclusively use they / them pronouns. 

Now, as I mentioned I'm fairly comfortable in my body and with my assigned sex, although I understand and appreciate this is not the experience of every non-binary person. Therefore, I don't disassociate with the pronouns he / him, having given it some thought recently I really don't think pronouns are important to me, at least not at the moment, I've told a couple of close friends that I've started to associate with being non-binary and basically said that anything is fair game, I'm happy to go by He / She or They. Although I know you don't have to I guess I feel that there is some expectation that identifying as non-binary means I should go by they / them pronouns. I can't say exactly why I don't exclusively want to use those pronouns, I think I like the freedom of not being limited to any one set but I also think it's partially that I don't want to force they / them on people.

I think my own personal understanding of my gender is that non-binary is more something I'm not than something I am, I'm not really searching for a label for what I am, more just content with existing somewhere outside of the binary, not in a fixed position.

I'd love to hear anyones thought's whether you relate to what I'm saying or can provide some validation that what I'm experiencing is a valid non-binary experience and where I might fit into it all?

2021-02-19 01:08:17,ln2oac,2,1,"tw for my mom's generally transphobic ideas

I've been struggling with some health issues and severe mental illness to the point where I'm basically non-functional and have decided to move back home. I'm not going to get into all the problematic shit that my mom has said about my identity and trans people in general, but she has a lot of weird pseudo-supportive ideas. Basically the ""I'm fine with gay people as long as they aren't gay around me"" kind of thing, which is really disappointing. Or ""I'm fine with trans people as long as they're binary and perfectly passing and not my child lol."" There's a lot of other really complex, backwards stuff that she has said that I could talk about and would maybe give more background info for the rest of my question, but I really just don't want to put it out there.

When it comes to pronouns: when I was 15 and came out to her she was totally against they/them pronouns, it's only plural, etc. It's been eight years since then (I spent most of it in the closet) and I finally started coming out and bringing it up with her again last year. She still thinks nonbinary identities are fake and that I chose to be like this because I read about it on 2014 tumblr (shout out to 2014 tumblr, miss u.) But she seems more willing to use my pronouns, not because she wants to? I don't know how to explain it. But she's changed a little bit. Another one of her arguments is that the word ""she"" means absolutely nothing to her and she doesn't mean anything by it so I shouldn't be ""offended"" when she says it. Whatever.

The thing is that I'm terrible about correcting people. It makes me really nervous and I don't like having the attention on me about such a ""controversial"" thing. But she was like ""there's no way you can expect people to use your pronouns if you don't correct them."" Partially fair, but also partially bs. To me it translated to ""I won't even make a conscious effort to use your pronouns myself, you have to remind me all the time."" 

I've seen people try to adjust to my new pronouns, I've had to adjust to other people's new pronouns, I really do understand that it takes time and mistakes are made (she likes to pretend that I don't believe that and I'm just crazy and angry and reactive but w/e.) I tried to explain to her that it's a two way street though. You have to make the effort to use the person's new pronouns too. It takes some amount of personal work. Maybe I should have corrected them more, but my friends got the hang of my pronouns after awhile completely on their own- because they cared enough to put in the effort to make the cognitive switch.

Anyway. I guess when I go home I'll start correcting her even though it makes me want to die and I don't really trust her to have a good reaction. But I'm not hopeful about it because she thinks this whole trans thing I'm on is ridiculous. And if she doesn't care enough to get my pronouns right then I don't believe she will. 

How long did it take for your parents/family to start using they/them pronouns? How did you get to that point? Do you believe that someone who doesn't respect or care about they/them pronouns can ever get to the point of using them naturally? I feel like this would all be easier if I just went by he/him but I'm not going to do that because that's not me.

I really think being back at home could be good for me, but I don't think I'll be able to stay there very long if nothing changes. It'll be really detrimental to me. When I went home for the holidays, hearing ""she"" and my deadname felt like being stabbed every time. But she refuses to understand that because it's ""just a word."" I'm not even pushing the new name issue on her yet, maybe I never will, she gets SO upset.

I never felt like 'woman' was really a word that described me, but since I've always called myself that and always used feminine pronouns and neither really felt wrong, I haven't thought about it much. Until today for some reason.

I just never felt like I fit in with other women, I've never identified with them much or felt like I had much in common, and anytime I've tried to be feminine has felt like an act. But I know I'm not a man either.

So I am sort of trying to sort out some shit in my head, and I wanted a safe place to be anonymous and ask for some advice. As a point of reference I am AFAB, pan, and am in my mid thirties. My partner is a cis het man about 40.

I sometimes I feel like I want to be a man, or more masculine or androgynous. Hate my body, and want to change it. But a lot of other times I feel very girly and feminine and want sparkles and frills etc. I never put a lot of thought into it because I was just like, oh everyone feels like that sometimes! And then I found out no, most people don't feel that way at all. Then I talked myself out of it again and was like ""patriarchy has just got you down, you probably just think things would be easier if you were a man"".

Then my partner and I had a baby. Being pregnant and breast feeding was a really awesome amazing experience. The only thing that has got me down about that is that my body is much more different now. Before I was relatively thin, small breasts, subtle curves. Now I am curvy as hell, and on days I feel very femme, I'm like ""fuck yeah you look just like Aphrodite on a clamshell you sexy, curvy ass bitch"", and other days I want to chop my boobs off because I can't hide them with a sports bra anymore and my hips are permanently wider.

These feelings intensified post-partum for SURE, and then I found out that non-binary don't have to be a boy/girl at the same time or just androgynous, you can be different genders at different times. But then that little voice in my head is like ""no no no this is just because you think you're fat, that's all, you aren't gender fluid"". But I keep thinking about it, and I'm afraid to talk to anyone I know about it. I have friends who are trans and NB, but I have it in my head that if I talk to then they'll think I'm just trying to be trendy or get attention or something. I have only talked to my partner of 17 years about it and he's really perfectly fine with it, and even asked me if I want to have some of his clothes (same pants size post partum now hahaha).

So at home I've been wearing some more masculine clothes, playing with makeup for a more masculine look with contouring). I think I might even wear some masc clothes to work some day this week when I feel up to it.

Basically I'm still working somethings about, but there are some things I'm still trying to sort out in my head. I am a very anxious person for sure. Here's some bullet points:

am I just reacting to sexism? ( I work in a male dominated field)

am I just reacting to a much more curvy body when I previously had a boxy body that I loved?

am I just looking for somewhere to fit in?

i don't have preferred pronouns, he/she/they all feel fine to me

I don't think I want to change my name or anything (although I did think up some pretty awesome ones). I like my name!

I don't want to take hormones or have surgery.

maybe I don't need to put a label on it? do I even need to tell anyone? I don't even really tell many people I'm pan.

2021-02-22 16:45:14,lpt4ys,10,1,"I might crosspost to ftm but there are more people who maybe didn't want to go surgery routes etc here so I wanted to start with you all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm AFAB and I've been privately and in some social spaces identifying as nonbinary for years now, but recently slowly coming to terms with the idea of being transmasc and wanting to get actual treatment - possibly low dose T, hysterectomy, top surgery. I don't feel ""binary"" male and don't want everything that more binary transmen seem to want (in particular I think facial and body hair might make me dysphoric in the other direction), but at the same time, feel very strongly that my life would be better in every way if I had been born biologically cis male, which I know is a common thought for trans people...

One of the reasons I'm struggling is that my dysphoria absolutely skyrockets around my period. For a week or so I'll want to bind, feel strongly that I'd take top surgery YESTERDAY if I could, and I start seriously contemplating T and brainstorming name changes... Then as I get past that, things even out. Today I'm officially past those symptoms and feeling like a lot of my ""I'm officially admitting I'm trans"" feelings are in doubt again.

I don't feel okay in my AGAB, or positive about my secondary sex characteristics, but I feel...neutral? Ambivalent. Like I can ""cope"" with them. I'm okay wearing regular bras because it's ""normal"" but I still dislike the fact that I have to if that makes any sense. But ""I can cope"" feels like the shit I've been telling myself all my life that has left me feeling constantly depressed and dissociated and struggling. ""Can cope"" with my agab does not seem like a feasible long term plan.

&amp;#x200B;

The question I have is - for anyone maybe genderfluid or otherwise who had large variance to the amount of dysphoria you experience, would it be reasonable to decide to get a hysterectomy FIRST and see if removing periods from my experience somehow evens things out enough? Did that change things? I still think I'm likely to want to get top surgery but I have a lot of complicated body image issues it connects with and I'm genuinely terrified of the medical side of things, which is mostly what's held me back so long.

Things of relevance: I've never wanted periods or kids, the entire pregnancy thing makes me want to throw up or stab my stomach, there is literally no concern for me about ""regret"" or whatever. It's purely a ""this serves no function for me but to make my life more miserable.""

I don't have a supportive family network or a partner, so one of my fears is medical recovery solo, so another piece is that a hysterectomy is easier recover so I think of as a ""starting point"" maybe?

2021-02-22 23:26:09,lq35x5,2,1,"Hi, I'm new here and I thought that someone could help me out. 

I have been questioning my gender for quite some time and, after some months of thinking and talking with my closer friends, I want to come out as gender fluid. There are three problems here. First of all, I wanna clarify that there's really nothing wrong with my birth name, but I don't think it really suits me and this thought have been around my mind for years now. So, after taking some names in consideration, I have finally choosed to go by Dabby, due to it being similar to my original name. I would like to ask for opinions about the name and what do people think of it, because I feel really comfortable with it but I would also like to hear about other points of view.

One of the other problems is that I don't know how to tell this to my parents. Even though they are not homo or transphobic, they don't really know what non-binary genders are and I would never know where to start if I were to explain it to them.

2021-02-23 19:04:29,lqq6rw,6,4,"Hi! 

I'm a 15 year old AFAB. I identify as a demigirl or non-binary woman and i'm an ace lesbian. For the most part I label myself as a non-binary ace lesbian, using non-binary as an umbrella term for my identity. 

I always end up doubting myself and it sucks. I hate it and I just want to be happy with the labels I choose. I am happy. I am. I just am scared that people in the community are going to tell me, I don't count. Which is stupid! I know! But I'll explain why. 

I use they/them pronouns and have been for a couple months now. Well I used to use she/they, then they/she and now just they/them. I don't mind she/her though and I still use it with extended family. I don't feel like explaining they/them pronouns and I'm not sure if I'll stick with it for forever or go back to she/they/they/she for convenience. 

I call myself a girl, a woman and I actually prefer female terms over masculine or neutral. I don't experience gender dysphoria and I'm okay with stereotypical female things and I pass as cis and don't correct people or say ""well actually i'm non-binary."" I don't feel the need, because I feel like if I said I was non-binary I'd make things more confusing if I said ""oh you can call me a girl, or I like female terms."" 

I know it's all about preference. I know there's so many non-binary people who are comfortable being called a girl/woman or a boy/man. I know non-binary people use gendered pronouns. 

I just feel like I don't fit in...or more so I'm afraid of taking someone's spot. I don't understand the struggle of dysphoria, I don't understand the struggle of having to say ""Actually I'm-"" 

I'm fine being perceived as a girl/woman. I'm fine with everyone thinking I'm a cis girl. It's whatever, because I know that I don't feel like a full female. 

I just feel like me...and even though I love the label. I like demigirl, non-binary woman and just non-binary. I'm just scared I still don't count. It's all very new to me. I have been identifying as a cis girl for fifteen years and now I'm just realizing. I don't feel like I completely fit that identity. 

Yes I call myself a girl. Yes I'm okay with being called a girl. Yes I actually love and prefer female terms. 

But I feel disconnected from femininity. I don't feel like that's me. I don't want to be in that box of just female. I feel trapped there...I just want to express and call myself whatever I want. 

Saying all this makes me scared I just sound like a cis girl trying to be ""cool &amp; quirky."" Maybe I am just trying to be cool and stick out? I genuinely don't know! Everything feels so confusing and scary. I don't want to offend people, I don't want to be alienated and I don't want to be just female.

I identify as a demigirl or non-binary woman and i\'m an ace lesbian. For the most part I label myself as a non-binary ace lesbian, using non-binary as an umbrella term for my identity. \n\nI always end up doubting myself and it sucks. I hate it and I just want to be happy with the labels I choose. I am happy. I am. I just am scared that people in the community are going to tell me, I don\'t count. Which is stupid! I know! But I\'ll explain why. \n\nI use they/them pronouns and have been for a couple months now. Well I used to use she/they, then they/she and now just they/them. I don\'t mind she/her though and I still use it with extended family. I don\'t feel like explaining they/them pronouns and I\'m not sure if I\'ll stick with it for forever or go back to she/they/they/she for convenience. \n\nI call myself a girl, a woman and I actually prefer female terms over masculine or neutral. I don\'t experience gender dysphoria and I\'m okay with stereotypical female things and I pass as cis and don\'t correct people or say ""well actually i\'m non-binary."" I don\'t feel the need, because I feel like if I said I was non-binary I\'d make things more confusing if I said ""oh you can call me a girl, or I like female terms."" \n\nI know it\'s all about preference. I know there\'s so many non-binary people who are comfortable being called a girl/woman or a boy/man. I know non-binary people use gendered pronouns. \n\nI just feel like I don\'t fit in...or more so I\'m afraid of taking someone\'s spot. I don\'t understand the struggle of dysphoria, I don\'t understand the struggle of having to say ""Actually I\'m-"" \n\nI\'m fine being perceived as a girl/woman. I\'m fine with everyone thinking I\'m a cis girl. It\'s whatever, because I know that I don\'t feel like a full female. \n\nI just feel like me...and even though I love the label. I like demigirl, non-binary woman and just non-binary. I\'m just scared I still don\'t count. It\'s all very new to me. I have been identifying as a cis girl for fifteen years and now I\'m just realizing. I don\'t feel like I completely fit that identity. \n\nYes I call myself a girl. Yes I\'m okay with being called a girl. Yes I actually love and prefer female terms. \n\nBut I feel disconnected from femininity. I don\'t feel like that\'s me. I don\'t want to be in that box of just female. I feel trapped there...I just want to express and call myself whatever I want. \n\nSaying all this makes me scared I just sound like a cis girl trying to be ""cool &amp; quirky."" Maybe I am just trying to be cool and stick out? I genuinely don\'t know! Everything feels so confusing and scary.

I can also do an image gallery of the responses if people want, but wanted to post the concise version to start off.

&amp;#x200B;

With over 400 results, the numbers (with small amounts of rounding):

&amp;#x200B;

# What is your gender identity?

Nonbinary: 83%

Genderfluild: 14%

Genderqueer: 13%

Agender: 18%

About 40 people also selected a custom option. Because this question allowed people to choose more than one option, I'm not going to include these for now because most were a single individual.

&amp;#x200B;

# Do you consider yourself transgender?

Yes: 52%

No: 15%

I'm not sure: 16%

Privately but I'm uncomfortable with the label: 14.5%

Since the rest of the responses only had 1-3 answers per response, I'll leave them out of the main data for now.

&amp;#x200B;

# Do you use or want to use different pronouns from those assigned at birth/that match your agab?

Yes: 73.4%

No: 5.6%

Sometimes: 21%

&amp;#x200B;

# Have you done the following to validate your gender identity?

Cut or grown out hair: 82.5%

Dyed hair: 37.4% (note this wasn't originally on the survey but was added along the way)

Changed clothing choices/fashion: 82%

Binder or insert to change chest shape: 59%

Pack or use gaff: 18.7%

Changed name socially or legally: 

Asked people to use different pronouns: 84%

HRT: 31%

Surgery: 28%

&amp;#x200B;

# Have you experienced gender euphoria from any of the things in the above question?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes: 84.5%

No: 3%

I'm not sure: 12%

&amp;#x200B;

# Do you experience physical or body dysphoria?

For example, as a really little kid, I remember feeling like a girl. Around 8, I recall wishing I was a boy  and even tried to change my name. As a teen, I think I felt like a girl, but was very uncomfortable being one.

   Now, as an adult, I think I might be nonbinary, but I'm worried that I'm just a gender nonconforming woman. But the thought of living the rest of my life as a woman makes my skin crawl, sometimes. (Not that there's anything wrong with  women or being a woman)

  I'm also kinda nervous that it's all just my mental illness. I have ocd, depression and anxiety, which tend to have specific themes like worrying about my identity. What if my ocd just convinced me that I'm nonbinary?  

  In short my questions are: 
1. Can your gender change over the course of your life?

Its my first time posting here.

I recently ""discovered"" that I was non-binary and its just confusing. I have all these mixed feelings about myself and I don't feel valid at all. It seems like I can't figure out what I want for myself and it's starting to be so overwhelming.

First of all, I'm AFAB and I prefer go for the they/them pronouns but I don't mind if ***sometimes*** i get refered as a she. But like no more than one sentence... It's just so weird. 

I'm in a relationship and my girlfriend supports me a 100% and I'm really grateful for that. I like when I get called ""baby girl"" or ""girlfriend"" or ""future wife"" by her, but I don't like being refered as a woman by anyone else. 

I also would like to change my name at some point for a more neutral one but I don't feel like I deserve it because of all the questions I have about myself.

It's just so hard because I've never felt more comfortable with myself than since I came out to my girlfriend and close friends, but also all the changes are getting overwhelming and I'm scared it's gonna be overwhelming for them too and ending up leaving me.

I realised today it's because I seem to have three different 'genders', the gender of my brain (mental), the gender/body I want for myself (physical), and the gender/presentation I want others to see (social).

So, here's the thing. Mental gender? Probably agender, but sometimes a little bit masc or a little bit femme. Usually it just alters my dysphoria a bit, or what clothes I feel like wearing. Probably best expressed as ""uhhh"" or ""??????"".

Physical gender? Well, that one seems to have changed in recent months. I used to think I wanted to go on T, but now I'm not so sure. For a long time I wanted to have a nearly-flat chest, boxy body, and didn't mind the idea of facial hair. Now, I'm thinking I just want a reduction to something like an A cup or small B cup, and a deeper voice (but I hate my voice in general because I have a dumb accent).

I get a lot of dysphoria around my hair, too. For my 'physical gender', maybe because of sensory issues, I want my hair SUPER SHORT. And that's how it is right now.

But, my social gender on the other hand, I feel embarassed to have such short hair and want it longer. And for all I want an androgynous body and to not be gendered, I don't mind the consequences of being read as female. Like, I'm small and frail, so it's nice that people go to help me if I'm having trouble. If they read me as male, I'd be frowned on for showing weakness.

Backing that up, before I got my hair cut, I decided to put on a binder and 'dress like a straight boy' to see how I felt. Looked in the mirror, hated it, started crying as I took it all off. 

I don't feel any degree of femininity despite all that. 

And maybe I'm just getting messed up on it because I'm still training myself out of binary-thinking, and I'm worrying too much about what 'binary' people sort me into and how that influences my presentation versus how I actually want to be.

i think multiple different body types would’ve worked for me. like, i often say i wish i was “born male”, and sometimes that’s 100% true, but not *really*. like, a flat chest would’ve been nice; but also, sometimes i get really jealous of people with breast implants. i don’t have the kinda money or decisiveness to make either of those happen, so right now i just look like me. and i don’t really *love* looking like me.

but i’d like to *learn* to love it, and i’d like to learn to love and embrace my gender and my body on my own terms, but sometimes people say things that remind me that that’s pretty much impossible.

basically, the big one that hits me the most is being told that i need to “masculinize” my shape (ie., lose weight), just because i’m a person who would like to be read as a guy, y’know, on occasion. well-meaning people try to give me weight-loss advice, both online and IRL, and it’s sweet, but it’s extremely triggering. why am i not enough as i am? why is my body not enough as it is? what gives anyone the right to say anything like that to another human being?

i’m sorry my transition isn’t linear in a way that other people’s can be, or in a way that cis people have seen on TV, like, once at most. *i* feel like my transition and journey, while not linear, actually makes a lotta sense when you stop to think about it, but i’m worried that no-one will. and that people will keep saying insensitive things to me to try to help, that make me want to hurt myself.

It's so hard for me to genuinely look in the mirror and dress the way I want to dress. It's hard for me to overcome the conditioning that tells me that having a fat AFAB body with big boobs means I have to appeal to my assets and work hard to be desirable to men by overcompensating for my fatness with hyperfemininity - even if I don't want to be hyperfeminine. 

I have to emphasize my chest because if I de-emphasize it to deal with dysphoria, the undesirable parts of me a.k.a my stomach will show.

I have to emphasize my feminine body parts because I can't pull off androgyny, fatness is always feminine because it is round and soft and not hard and angular. 

I've recently learned that learning how to dress fat bodies is a skill that is different from dressing thin bodies, because your weight carries different, your general shape is different, and many clothes aren't made to fit your shape properly because they are made for thin people. And it's good to know that it isn't just my body that's wrong when things are I'll fitting or look off, but there are so so so many models of how to dress fat bodies in a hyperfeminine way, but so few that are androgynous or masculine that appeal to me. It's incredibly frustrating to see amazing masc and andro looks on thin people, look for those clothes, try them on yourself, and then feel ridiculous because your body is so round and curvy and just doesn't have the same effect that it does in the picture.

2021-02-27 02:28:51,lte44m,4,2,"Hello people !

(I did read the post-it advising to not ask advice for a name until the discord is out but i still do want advice and hear view about a little topic.)

So, i'm not out yet IRL and trying to choose my choosen name, so far i'm thinking about the neutral ""Lou"" which is nice in my country where there is a lot of ""Louis"" and ""Louise"". I play a lot of video games and i intend to do content on the internet so i might take an alias with a play on word with the name/sound ""Lou"".

First of it, do you think it's a good idea to have an alias related to my future name ? (it's linked to me wanting people to call me by this name, with people shortening my future alias naturally even if i'm not out to them)

Secondly do you find the name ""Lou"" appropriate (i know it might sound like a sort of synonym of toilet in english (""Loo""), not sure it's pronounced in the same way xD) ? (For the record i live in France)

If you have any funky or funny play-on-word for ""Lou"" be my guest :D (in english or in french)

A thing i really like about the name ""Lou"" is that it can refer to ""Louis"" and it's female form, Louen (a breton name) and it's female form (Lou-anne) and can also be used for other different names like Ludwig or Luis (the pronunciation of ""Louis"" or ""Louise"" in hispanic, i guess ?). I'm not sure how to explain this but what do you think of bearing a name that can be at the same time the diminutive version of all these names ? What i mean is, depending on the situation i can tell that it's the diminituve of the name i want, depending on how i want to present etc... Is it okay, is it common to do this ?

Well, i'm lurking around there trying to learn and understand what i can but for the moment it's all that i will ask :)

2021-02-27 10:14:26,ltl5nv,6,24,"Ok, I don’t know why this just clicked for me. Two distinct memories from senior year of high school.

I had to take photos for the yearbook, and my mom was very excited and did my makeup for me and we drove to the photography place and was taking photos of me, and I felt super uncomfortable the whole time, until I just burst into uncontrollable tears. I couldn’t really explain why- like I knew at the time that I preferred being androgynous and I couldn’t get makeup to work for me, it always felt bad.

The same thing happened at prom too. I had to get a dress because my mom wouldn’t let me get a suit. My mom did my makeup. And I just burst into tears in the bathroom before leaving, just so so uncomfortable.

I mean, some of it is probably social anxiety, too... but it’s so obviously textbook dysphoria. I don’t know. 

I thought I was a trans guy in college, but backed down from it when telling my dad went poorly, and just kind of ignored the whole thing altogether — I didn’t realize being nonbinary was a thing. I just started presenting as I liked, fairly androgynously, and I feel pretty good about the way I look now without any pressure to dress femininely or wear makeup.

I haven’t totally adopted the nonbinary label because I don’t know if I have a lot of social dysphoria; only when I’m really thinking about gender do I get it. I do get euphoria from being perceived as confusing/male. since I don’t mind being seen as a girl most of the time, I’m worried about attracting too much attention to my gender identity by calling myself nonbinary... but i DO kinda want to chop my tots off lol

I just started presenting as I liked, fairly androgynously, and I feel pretty good about the way I look now without any pressure to dress femininely or wear makeup.\n\nI haven’t totally adopted the nonbinary label because I don’t know if I have a lot of social dysphoria; only when I’m really thinking about gender do I get it. I do get euphoria from being perceived as confusing/male. since I don’t mind being seen as a girl most of the time, I’m worried about attracting too much attention to my gender identity by calling myself nonbinary... but i DO kinda want to chop my tots off lol\n\nsorry, just super rambly late night thoughts since I haven’t gotten around to getting a therapist lol. \n\nwhat do you guys think? any sudden revelations? anything you relate to?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'Ohhh, that was dysphoria', 'created': 1614446066.0}"

I want to try binding but I have a few questions about binders. I think I'm a DD technically but I can wear sports bras no problem. They honestly don't seem that big to me.

I work in a very physically demanding job and sometimes taking a break to catch my breath isn't an option AT ALL. 

Would you recommend a light binder? Or are they too contrictive for working in as well? 

I wear a sports bra to smoosh those tiddies down, and my work uniform is a loose fit button down, so that reduces how obvious they are quite a bit.

My name is... well, that's still in progress. Lou or Léon for now.

I went back in the closet for the entire 2020 year, after some humiliating transphobic moments. 

That was the first time I gave up, called myself cis, ""acted cis"" and repressed dysphoria since I was 13 years old. I had been openly trans, although never believed. I got told recovering from mental illness meant ""making peace with being a woman."" I fell down a rabbit hole of radfem ideology... being applauded for ~choosing~ not to be trans, to not destroy my ~beautiful female body~ and that therapy had made me cis again.

Til it all fell apart in early 2021. You just can't run away from dysphoria forever... it always catches up with you. It was almost the end of me this time around. I completely shut down.

I told my closest loved ones. I realized my boyfriend fell in love with me, not my ""made up womansona"" as he put it, and that my new friends were excited for my transition, not frightened or disgusted. I realized the dozens of french doctors who has gaslit me into believe ""transgender"" wasn't real thing, HRT was illegal to prescribe, refusing to give resources or refer me, had manipulated me. They made me give up on myself and my transition dreams. I realized feminist transphobes didn't actually care about me. They just hated what I was.

In Ontario, I finally got a community with validating terminology and trans positive doctors! Still, I didn't believe the nice nurse and doctor talking to me about dysphoria really would help me. I kept laughing off my boyfriend talking about my future transition, because I previously did so much begging and had so many false starts. It hurt less to see it as impossible, than to get my hopes up again.

Until... they sent the T prescription to my pharmacy. And I held it in my hand yesterday.

All it takes is one sympathetic cis person. 

Just one cis doctor to take pity on a trans person, validate them, and guide their transition.
