2021-01-01 18:21:13,kog20o,5,1,"First, despite more than a decade of gender confusion started from childhood, I just came to terms with being trans last week, so I’m still learning a lot of things about our community. If any language choice in my post comes as inappropriate please point it out, and I’m deeply sorry in advance. 

I’m AFAB. I prefer neutral language, but if it has to be gendered the masculine version still feels better. To me, “guy/dude” is better than “girl”, “man” better than “woman”, “he” better than “she”... whenever someone refers to me as “sir” or “boy” in public I feel a strong sense of euphoria. Like I successfully trick them into believing I’m not a girl. I can’t stand being seen as feminine at all. 

But in an ideal world I prefer no gendered terms, I’m just a person. I choose the “other/X” option whenever possible and actively enjoys not revealing my gender online. That’s the only moment I feel I’m truly being myself. If someone repeatedly ask me about my gender I sometimes tell them I’m a guy which makes me feel better than saying I’m a girl (hell, even typing these words out is hard...), but I still feel like I’m pretending to be something I’m not. I’m just me. I sometimes using masculine language to refer to myself (but more like in a slang sense? Like “I’m a tech guy”) but most of the times neutral language makes me feel the best. 

Luckily for me, English being my native language is mostly gender neutral. We still have a long way to go for sure, but grammatically speaking this is a matter of fact. Like we only have gendered pronouns for third person which is far less frequent than first and second person, when you can actually heard it being used to refer to you (lots of usage of third person pronouns happen when that person is absent). I gave up on learning a few languages that I was once interested in, because they need you to use gendered terms for yourself in almost every sentence. I can’t use the feminine version on myself — I really can’t, it’s a mental torture. I can accept the masculine version, but it feels more like a compromise when neutral version isn’t available. 

Does this actually mean I’m a trans dude in denial? Although I have lots of chest dysphoria and slightly-better-but-definitely-exists dysphoria about my curves in general (waist, hip etc), I don’t want other masculine body features apart from the general “square” body shape and no chest. I don’t shave (I love my body hairs lol) but I don’t actively pursue more either. Beard is a no. Both male and female voices don’t feel “exactly right” for me (I know this is very weird...). I don’t want huge muscles. Slightly less feminine facial features will be the best but I don’t want full blown masculine ones. I’m interested in packing because it makes my pants look better, but the actual idea of have female parts or male parts are both equally “meh, ok” to me. The idea of being able to get pregnant absolutely creeps me out. The idea of producing sperms sound very gross too. I think my ideal body among all the available options would be the bigger version of a young boy haha. Slightly masculine, but without full blown male secondary sex characteristics. 

Some childhood history — I insisted on being a boy not a girl for several years since a very early age (about 3 I think). I remember my birthday wish I turned 9 was to magically become a boy. I mostly made friends with other boys around that time. Later on, as the “social segregation” became obvious during the late years of elementary, I started to have no friends. Girls’ social group was definitely not an option, but guys’ didn’t feel right either. I don’t mean in a sense that they’d see me as a girl and reject me, but I genuinely didn’t feel the desire to join them either. Like I was the middle ground in a black and white world. It was lonely. 

Socially, I don’t understand how both girls and guys of my age make friends with each other at all. Like AT ALL. Sometimes I secretly wish everyone is genderless. I know this is not right but it would make my life so much easier. No more confusion and frustration. Above experience makes me very socially awkward irl — all my genuine friendships are online. 

TL; DR: if I have to fit into a binary society, I prefer being a man than being a woman. But if non binary options are allowed, that’s the one makes me most comfortable.

So, I am a gamer. I am also new to the nonbinary community and everything that comes with it. I've loved games my whole life, particularly life sims and character creators.

I'm afab and rather neutral about female pronouns, but noticed that – in English speaking communities – I'm much more comfortable with they/them. Euphoric even. 
This works for online spaces like Reddit or Twitter, but sadly I don't live in an English speaking country and my native language is *heavily* gendered. There is no gender-neutral pronoun aside from 'it', which is only used for objects, never for people.

I found a lot of people on this sub encouraging questioning or new enbys to try out they/them pronouns and I just feel like I will never feel this euphoria. It almost feels like I have two different identities, an English online identity and a 'real one' which is androgynous looking but, unfortunately, will always be referred to as female. 
Even non-binary characters in media are translated as male or female here and completely erased. Neo-pronouns are unheard of and lead to long discussions and ridicule, which I honestly have no energy for.

2021-01-03 02:09:24,kpbajq,6,1,"Hello, I’m an AMAB agender person who identifies as non-binary. Early 30s.

Coming out feels like it’s been quite a slow journey. I started questioning my gender identity around 3 years ago, and I’ve been self-identifying as non-binary for around a year and a half, maybe more. I first came out to a couple friends a few months ago.  And I’m near the point of no return of coming out more broadly (with most friends and at work) — and with a new name, and change in my presentation. I’ve decided to take the first interaction I have with people this year to do so, and I told two friends today who had texted me happy new year.

Each step feels in its own way like a mini-crisis. How will this particular friend/person react? What questions will I have to answer or language to correct?  What if I hate people using my new name/knowing my gender identity?

There’s some even bigger things further out on the horizon... Will I come out to my family? Will I legally change my name (first and last)? HRT? Or what if I change my mind and go back in the closet or renounce being non-binary?

I feel anxiety and fear around rejection, instability, ostracization...

...and I also have to trust myself. I’ve brought myself this far and I’m doing the best I can.

I had the realization that a large part of it all is the fact that this is an upheaval of existing expectations, habits, histories with other people... I imagined moving to a new city and starting all over, and I feel very confident that I would be sure I would want people I meet to know me as the ‘new me’ rather than the ‘old me.’ So...

Luckily for me once I got out of there and saw the world through the Navy my shell was cracked and eventually I was able to open up and accept. At this point in my life I have yet to have actively explored the options out there even though my partner and I agreed to an open relationship to figure ourselves out and know what we really wanted. We ended up not really following that for the past few years as we ended up deciding to have a child. Now that we are a year into our child's life we clearly started questioning ourselves again and our decisions. Now for me I have fully accepted that I am not the straight white male I was raised to be. Beyond my Bisexuality I started realizing things about myself. What started out as wearing underwear designed for women for fun has turned into me wanting and desiring to wear things that are feminine and cutsey because it makes me feel better. Among other things and remember the dreams I would have about being a girl as a child I have come to question am I really meant to be a male. Outside of everything I want to recognize I have a particularly strong feminine side to myself. Its all very confusing to me as if you were to look at me right now you might think I'm quirky but im 5'7"" with a awkward length ginger man bun hair style and rather thick beard, and rather built with some extra weight on top. I have this side of me that knows what I want to look like and this isn't it, yet I still accept what I look like. As I think about this more and more the idea of adding more feminine clothes, cosmetics and accessories to myself makes me rather curious and happy. My partner and I on new years night revisited opening up and going out to explore what we feel about ourselves, for her that means she wants to try being romantic with other women and really know if she is missing out on a side of her she feels she has. For me its the same thing but with males etc. But also I want to explore more of my feminine side, and I'm not really sure how to do that, I told her that I've had these feelings and am figuring myself out, and ofcoirse she is supportive but I don't want to take it too far too fast to give her any anxiety. To me this feels like a thought situation and I feel very vulnerable. If you've read this far I thank you very much. I am not expecting anything from this post nor do I think its a great post i need to work on my opening up, but still would appreciate any reaction, or supportive words, theories, or advice anyone would feel like sharing. I'm in a tough spot and don't event know what to call my self I don't feel fully male and might be somewhere in between, maybe Genderqueer I guess that's where I am at for figuring things out.

2021-01-05 06:50:20,kqsr1j,3,1,"Hi! My name is Ryn and I am brand new to being non binary. I figured it out 2 weeks ago, though it’s been a vague question in my mind for a few months. So I’m just coming on here to ask what wisdom you all have to share with me. I’m going to leave more about myself below, but any advice you have to share with me is really appreciated. I’m just trying to figure out this new world. There are five things I’m really struggling with: my deadname, my clothes, dysphoria, my hair, and coming out. You don’t really have to read it all to help out, I just though some background would help. 


As I said, my name is Ryn. I’m 17, afab, and also a lesbian. The first thing I’m having a hard time with is my deadname. It’s one of those typical white girl hyper femme names. And although I already know what my real name is, and I couldn’t love it more, my deadname is EVERYWHERE. It’s in most of my usernames, all over my room,  and of course, all my friends, family, and coworkers use it. I’ve started changing my usernames and taken down all my name memorabilia but it still feels like I’m losing something. I love Ryn, but it feels like I’m starting over and I’m mourning the loss of my old name. I have a lot of positive memories associated with it, but it still makes me uncomfortable every day. Any advice about how to handle this? Is it normal to mourn the loss of a name? I still hate it for my now, but it was a part of my for so long... I don’t really know how I’m feeling about it. 


The next thing I’m struggling with is my gender presentation. I have a pretty basic feminine closet, with a few things that I’ve bought from thrift stores that I actually like. So I guess I wanna know how to go about dressing in a way that doesn’t feel really feminine without buying a whole new closet. (And I know that clothes don’t have a gender, and there’s no one way to dress like an enby, but I still hate most of my “girl clothes”) 


On a bit more serious note: dysphoria. I don’t usually hate my breasts. I have one bra that I can hardly feel, and one that does an okay job with flattening, but they’re not quite enough. I’ve heard of people bindings with ace bandages, does that actually work? Is there anything else I can use to bind without actually ordering a binder? I have worse dysphoria around my hips. I have a very feminine shape in that area, and I was wondering if there is anything I can do to lessen that feeling? 


So I have really long hair. Like past my butt long, and it’s something I was really attached to for a long time. I haven’t changed my hair since I was like 7, but now, I really want to cut it. I can pull back most of the time, but I just don’t like having it on my head. How do I go about getting it cut? Should I go to a decent hairdresser or do it myself or wait until my favorite aunt who’s a pro hairdresser to do it when she comes home this summer? I’m really sensitive about my hair, it’s kind of like my signature to the rest of the world. I feel like my hair means a lot to the people around me, and I know I’m not supposed to care, but the way my friends/family see me is important to me. When I do cut it, it’ll be a really drastic change, and I don’t know if I want to do something so permanent right now. Any tips for making my really long hair look a little less feminine? 


And finally coming out. I’ve known I’m gay for like 4 years, though I’m not out about that at home either. This is just fo different from coming out as gay. I can’t just tell the important people, I have to tell everyone or I get deadnamed constantly. I find that really annoying. I can introduce myself to a new person with my real name, but I have to correct every single person who knows me, it’s got to be exhausting. I guess what I’m worried about is figuring out who I want to tell and how much. How do you know who this people are? Are my coworkers worth it? My dance teacher? My friends parents? I’m pretty much good with telling my friends who I am and who I want to be, but my parents are a different category. I think my mom will be fine, though it will take her time to get used to it. I’m mostly worried about my stepmother, but that’s a different conversation. How do you go about telling people that you have a different name? And how do parents usually react when we tell them that we’re rejecting the name they gave us and making up our own? I have a plan to tell my mom in 3 months, just to make sure that everything sticks so that I don’t have to have a billion conversations about how she can’t say daughter anymore. I want to make sure I don’t change my mind, I guess, but it feels like forever when I’m getting misgendered/deadnamed constantly. Is it a shred to wait, even if I’m almost positive now? Do you all have anything I should send to/tell my mom when I come out in 3 months? What else do I need to know about having to come out to everyone who knows me as [deadname]?

2021-01-05 08:32:01,kqu61r,5,1,"My girlfriend came out to me as a trans woman back in February 2020 but is still closeted to most people and pre-everything. I started doing research into the things she discussed such as gender dysphoria and the trans community. Long story short, I realized that these terms and experiences I was reading about didn't just make sense but actually applied to my own life. I realized that my experience with gender was different than a cis woman's. I spent some more time researching and reflecting, and I came out as non-binary a few months ago. 

My girlfriend said she was supportive and has been in some ways, like when it comes to me wearing different clothes or otherwise experimenting with my gender presentation. She once mentioned me having top dysphoria, which made me happy because she was acknowledging that I experience dysphoria. She has asked what terms I prefer and has called me handsome, etc. However, she won't really use my pronouns. She said she's trying but they/them is hard for her. Ok, I get it, but it's been a few months now. When she does use they/them for me, it's because she's correcting herself after using she/her. Her tone always sounds off during the correction to the point where I stopped trying to correct her because it seemed like too much work or too annoying to her for me to press it. 

Today I discussed how realizing that I'm non-binary made me more aware of the things that bother me or give me dysphoria and how I'm still struggling with my gender presentation. I'm not sure what makes me feel best yet. I also talked about my frustration with the fact that even if I present the way I want, nobody will ever clock me as non-binary; people will always assume male or female. She started asking questions about whether I'm sure I'm non-binary, how I know, and why I care so much what other people think. I told her one of the things that tipped me off was when I read what women--trans and cis alike--say about womanhood and their gender identities and realized how I resonated with nearly none of it but read what non-binary folks say about their stories with gender and felt that those experiences resonated much more. She said that doesn't necessarily mean I'm non-binary because I probably read ""the extremes"" about womanhood and gender. She's also told me before that she doesn't ""really understand"" non-binary. 

The whole thing felt hypocritical in a way. I'm using a new name and pronouns for her and I see her as a woman 100%. She's still closeted to most people so I'm doing that while nobody else is. Gendering someone correctly is not a favor or a gift that needs to be repaid, it's common decency, so I'm not pointing this out to say that I deserve claps or to shame her for asking this of me but just to further emphasize why I am confused about how my identity is hard for her to understand. I flat out asked her if she thinks I'm wrong or ""copying her"" in some way by coming out shortly after she did and she said no, but I don't know if I believe her. 

I think she's not actually convinced I'm non-binary. I'm kind of hurt by this. I thought she would understand. She's understood nearly everything I've gone through in the last 3+ years of our relationship. I love this woman and I want to propose to her this year, but this really blows. I find myself wanting to go back into the closet and pretend to be a cis woman because almost nobody in my life validates my non-binary identity. I have two non-binary friends who use my correct pronouns and don't question me.

For example, I've always felt like I'm not pretty enough, and that my chest is too small, and that I'm built too broad, and that my voice is too deep, things like that. I've wanted to appear more feminine.

I've been in therapy since July for various reasons. One thing I've realized there is that I center my worth on what others think of me. So, growing up being a naturally more masc AFAB person, I think I maybe just learned to ""want"" to adhere more to binary womanhood because that is what is desired in females in our society. 

Well, since I came out to myself as nonbinary, I have noticed that I've become a lot happier with my body being as masc as it is (which i remember also liking about myself before I hit puberty). And at the same time, I find myself wishing things like that my chest were even smaller so that I could *really* get away with appearing androgynous. 

Basically, I didn't really experience dysphoria until I allowed myself to accept myself as something other than a binary woman/man. But now that I am comfortable with that label, it's weird because I both have a much greater acceptance for my body now than I ever did, and I find that I'm dysphoric about certain things now.

Idk how to even start this but I guess I've been questioning my gender for a while (I'm amab, 21), but am just too scared to open up to someone about it. That, combined with my unwillingness to be vulnerable with people has been the cause of a lot of pain and struggle for me for a while, and I just need to get all of it off my chest and talk with people who understand and won't judge me. Living in Texas has made it that much harder, I've literally never talked with anyone about gender ever.

Let me start off by saying I HATE toxic masculinity, I have no desire to be masculine or dominant, it just all feels so fake and like everyone guy is in some grand competition to see who can beat their chest the hardest and the loudest. It's just not me at all, I'm a caring, loving, sensitive guy and hate that I feel like I have to hide it. There are some male gender norms I feel fine with, but others I just don't identify with at all. I haven't talked with any of my friends or family about this because I just hate feeling like a burden. I'm such a people pleaser and hate the feeling of conflict, and hate the idea that some people just straight up won't like me because I'm being honest with myself. (I know my close friends and family will be accepting it's just hard) As a result I feel as though I've internalized a lot of these struggles and done some things I'm extremely ashamed of...

This is where it gets really hard for me to open up, and I feel like I'll neveerrr be able to tell anyone I know in real life about this (also I apologise if this violates NSFW rule but I feel like it applies to what I'm going through). I'm very sexually submissive, and because I'm not able to open up to anyone about this (as I'm scared of conflict and being seen as not masculine), I've been very lonely recently. As a result I've gone and gotten myself addicted to financial domination. If you don't know what it is, essentially I've thrown away thousands of my own hard earned dollars towards girls that literally just bully me and take advantage of me at my most vulnerable points. I'm so ashamed and disappointed in myself because of it and just feel so trapped with no way out. And to make me feel worse is that I know I'm a catch, like I'm an attractive, smart, funny sensitive guy that I know a lot of people would be happy to date, I've just been too scared/socially anxious/introverted to ever go for it.

So that's why I've come here, I don't know if I'm non-binary, I feel like gender non-conforming is a better label?? Idk. But I just need some advice or maybe just some people to talk to because I need to get out this rut and I have got to stop sending money to people who don't give a shit about me. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

I hate to use the word but it's complicated.

I feel more feminine than masculine but what I've been finding is that I am more and more drawn to being neither.

Even interacting with other trans people in college, there weren't really many people I knew who identified as nonbinary. And, so, I just thought that ""since I'm not male, I must therefore be female."" An either-or.

I'm fishing for ideas :) I've come to realize that being more ""out"" about my gender involves being more caring of myself and others. However this is something I'm really not used to, as for me self-care ends up most of times internalizing normative injunctions about how my body should look like.

For example, I really like doing yoga, but the culture around yoga makes it difficult for me to practice it in a healthy way. The obsession about body-image prevents me from actually connecting to my body, which is partly what I need. I did practiced this morning for the first time in months, and it was really great! I hope I can keep focusing on the actual spiritual and healing part of yoga.

However yoga is very binary and sometimes trans-exclusionary (I quit the yoga studio partly because they were making courses dedicated to ""your inner feminine energy"" or whatever, it made me sick in my stomach). Anyway. I wonder if you have a spiritual practice and if you manage to keep gender binary outside of it?

And also if you'd like to share about the things you do to take care of yourself or have other ideas of self-care practice, I'd love to hear them! :)

I’m figuring some things out and I’ve only told my partner and a therapist I had to cancel my appointment with because of insurance issues. I could really use a place to vent and maybe some advice or hear from people who might relate.

I’m AFAB and I think I’m nonbinary/leaning more masc and I’m having a lot of conflicted feelings. I don’t really know what pronouns I want to use but for now I guess all of them are okay?

I haven’t been leaving the house lately, and not having people treat me like a woman constantly has made my gender identity clearer. I’m in my early 30s and just now externalizing a lot of repressed stuff, so it’s kind of a lot? 

I’m a little embarrassed because young people seem so self aware about this kind of stuff and I’m sorta clueless and constantly learning new things and very confused.

I struggled for a really long time to try and be extra feminine because I didn’t feel very feminine internally. I guess I thought if I could just make myself feminine *enough* I would stop feeling so bad about myself? And part of me still feels attached to that mindset?

Like I have so many “feminine” traits and behaviors I’m not sure if I actually enjoy, or if I’m just used to/associate with approval. And I don’t know how to figure out which is which? I think femininity is great and wonderful and I love it, but most of the time it just feels very forced when I try to do it. Like I’m wearing something fancy but uncomfortable that I can’t wait to take off at the end of the day. I used to spend forever trying to look cute and girly and end up having a panic attack because I could never get it “right”.

I really do think I’m non-binary and not a binary trans man, but confronting my masculinity is still super uncomfortable! I keep seeing/trying things I don’t think I’ll like (like wearing a binder and seeing peoples top surgery results, trying out men’s clothes, even the mascara beard thing, etc). But when I try them, or see other people doing those things, it makes me feel a kind of way I never thought I’d get to feel. And I usually end up crying because I’ve spend so much time denying those feelings, but it’s also a huge relief to let them out?

I’m also scared of having to learn to navigate the world in a new way. I’ve adapted a lot of defense/coping mechanisms from living as a woman and I don’t know how I’d navigate social situations without them. Does that kind of stuff change much when you start presenting more masc? Is life harder being out as non-binary? I am so worried that, if I come out, life will be so much harder that it’ll be just as bad as not liking myself all the time.

I’m sorry this is like a whole ass book, but I just feel like I’m going to implode if I don’t talk to someone, and I’m too scared to talk to any of the trans and non-binary people I know.

question 1: will i ever be able to be all cool about it, like ‘hey nbd i’m non-binary and this is my name and pronouns’? 
it’s definitely easier now than when i first came out to my closest friends and it’s hardest with like people i’ve known longer, but today an IT person called me about changing my name for my work email and i was panick. 
also today one of my close friends kept not using the right name, and i let it slide the first few times because i was anxious and it didn’t feel worth it, but eventually it annoyed me enough that i asked him if he could use my new name, and he was like ‘oh yeah sorry,’ and THEN a few minutes later did it again and called me pretty like twice in a row. i know i haven’t specifically told him i’d rather not be called femme things, but... i just get so anxious when i talk to people about it, so its hard to get up the nerve to correct people in the moment, and i usually just stick to the basics to get the convo over with as soon as possible. 
question 2: i’m sure other folx experience this but how do you deal with it? does it get easier the more you do it? 
i know coming out was the right move for me because i get so happy every time someone uses the right name and pronouns and it’s worth it, but it’s so exhausting to like keep coming out over and over again.

I'm from the US, and I'm in the process of legally changing my name after musing about it for years. There aren't a lot of people in my life I feel like I can turn to about this, and so far I've been going about this process completely alone by choice. Right now, though, I could really use some words of advice or encouragement. Here's the situation:

I just sent my paperwork to the court via USPS. This is a major step that in some ways I'm really proud to have reached, but my experience at the post office has me worrying. Because I was so anxious, I elected to send my papers as certified mail without really processing what that means. (Whoever receives the envelope will have to sign for it.) The USPS staff expressed confusion over why I would send the mail that way -- to be fair, they didn't know the contents of the envelope and I, again, was not thinking clearly. I just wanted to get this done.

After I left the post office, I started spiraling, thinking that certified mail was the wrong call. Who at the court am I expecting to sign for this, and what if no one is available to or wants to? This envelope that has an official copy of my birth certificate and the only notarized copy of my legal forms could float in limbo for longer than if I had just sent regular ol' mail. 

I realize these are anxious thoughts, and writing them out has made me think more clearly and critically, but does anyone have any insight about this? Should I not worry? Despite all my research before diving into this, my experience so far has left me super intimidated and second guessing my every move. After so many years of self-sabotage and convincing myself I wasn't ""trans enough,"" I can't help but fear that I will inadvertently sabotage myself in a new way.

So. I’ve known that I (AFAB) am non binary for a few years. It was never really an issue because I didn’t have dysphoria or anything, but sometimes my gender just didn’t feel like it existed. I wear t-shirts and jeans or shorts all the time. I enjoy makeup on occasion and a dress every now and then. I referred to myself using both male and female pronouns and don’t mind being she/her to others. I just ignored it because it didn’t really matter, and the label seemed meaningless. 

Until today. 

My partner came out a few weeks ago as non-binary, and we’ve been buying him “girl” clothes and practicing makeup and the like. He remembered a conversation we had a few years ago where I mentioned I didn’t feel gender, and said maybe I should explore it for real. 

We placed an order to TomboyX since they have the most comfortable underwear (in my opinion) and they have the special “tucking” underwear. I purchased their “binder” bra, because hey, if it didn’t do anything for me it’d be an amazing sports bra since I’m a runner. 

The order showed up today so I tried it on and put on one of his plain tshirts. And then I had this feeling that my partner told me was gender euphoria. [Next part redacted to keep it SFW] but it resulted in me sobbing. And. I just don’t know what to feel. I enjoy being “girl”, but do I enjoy being “boy” more? I’m angry and scared and so many other things because I’m feeling emotions that I don’t want to deal with. And I know that once I figure it all out I’ll be better off, but I’m scared.

2021-01-09 19:24:02,ktxgk3,5,1,"I'm not sure I know what dysphoria is """"""supposed"""""" to feel like or typically feels like. But yesterday I had a really weird experience where I felt like I kind of hated my body but in a nondiscrimate way? Like there are definitely parts of my body that trigger dysphoria more than others (looking at you, tiddies) but this time it didn't feel like that particular part of my by body was what I was having issues with. It just felt like my *entire* body, especially when I actively looked at it in the mirror, wasn't mine and just was kind of wrong? I felt really disconnected to it. Like on someone else it might look good but on me it just looks like it doesn't belong to me. And the reason why I'm wondering whether this is unusual is because it wasn't like I had an idea in my head of what I want my body to look like (that would be facilitated by hormones, surgery and other gender affirming care - other than maybe top surgery or a breast reduction lol). I wasn't like 'My body would look more like me if it looked like X'. I don't have a concrete sense of 'if I had X body/body part and could remove Y body part I would feel better' like so many trans people seem to. Just a feeling of wrong ness and a lack of knowledge as to what rightness would look like. I know it was a gender related feeling though because thinking about how most people see me as a girl and the general discomfort I always feel about this is what triggered it. 

I think the reason why I didn't have an idea of what I wanted my body to look like especially when I was feeling that disconnection super intensely is because, apart from my massive chest, I don't have an issue with my body. My dysphoria is mostly social, and intensely so, so much that just looking at myself in the mirror and coming to the conclusions that other people come to about my gender because of my body made me feel gross. I'm agender and subsequently, when I'm in the right headspace, see my body as also not gendered. But gender is violently pushed upon body parts, and knowing that I am curvy and that people feminize me because of it is really hard. Getting 'masculine' gendered features would just mean I would be misgendered in the opposite way. I just want my body to be intensely neutral but I also wish I didn't need to change it because at my very core (apart from the chest) I don't see my body as gendered, it's the *perception* of it and not the actually body that is the problem. This is an issue that is inevitably worsened by the fact that I'm in a transphobic environment and can't really leave soon, and being out is not really an option. I guess I felt abnormal because most of the time I see people talk about dysphoria, they have an idea of what they WANT to look like, and it's because they want their body gendered in a DIFFERENT way, not not-gendered at all.

About the gender itself, I think I believe in equality and that old steortipes of what man and woman has to act like are just wrong and should die.

2021-01-11 06:40:04,kux7lv,8,1,"For context – I’m AFAB agender, which to me means I don’t experience gender or am genderless. I usually experience dysphoria when I feel like people either gender me, my body, my behaviour, or things related to me. Or even when I think about how gendered society is. Being gendered in \*any way\* feels oppressive to me, I don’t have the common nonbinary experience of enjoying being gendered as the ‘opposite’ of my AGAB. And so, whenever I’m in spaces where gender is hyper-focused on especially in very binary ways, it can make me feel uncomfortable about my body/voice/behaviour because I feel like I am being gendered by-proxy. This means that particular trans spaces and discussions can trigger my dysphoria, especially binary trans spaces. 

OF COURSE – I don’t intend to say that it’s a bad thing that binary trans people have spaces to discuss their experiences. Not at all, I will always support the existence of these spaces. And cis people partake in gendered experiences too, they just have the privilege to be able to take them for granted. It’s not just trans people who care about gender. My brain just tends to become more hyperaware of my frustration with how much of our bodies, dynamics and experiences are gendered by the world when I’m in trans spaces because it’s actively being discussed, especially in regards to passing. 

Again, for a lot of trans people, that experience is immensely gratifying and is also in a lot of ways a means of alleviating dysphoria and being recognized and living as the gender they truly are. Trans people aren’t responsible for the binary cisnormative expectations about which characteristics and behaviours mean what. And they have every right to want to the feel kinship with other people of their gender and to live in a body that makes them feel euphoric and allows them to be gendered in an accurate and affirming way. But at least for me, as a genderless person, I don’t get any gratification from being gendered. Gender feels more like something that gets in the way and trips me up than something that is gratifying. So I find myself reading trans-related documents like the Gender Dysphoria Bible that make the assumption that all or most trans people enjoy gender, just when they get to partake in the \*right\* gender. Whereas I don’t enjoy it at \*all\* because there is no right gender for me. There’s \*no\* gender. I often feel like my life would be made MUCH better if I could just be a human being interacting with other human beings, gender completely or mostly irrelevant. Most of my gender euphoria comes about when I’m able to forget about what gender I’m supposed to be and just partake in whatever behaviour or presentation I want to completely outside of words like ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’ or ‘women’s’ and ‘men’s’. While lots of trans people like interacting with the world in a gendered way (to some degree - most people want to be considered people first and dislike exaggerated or patriarchal gender dynamics, but they also still enjoy gendered interactions) and lean into that as a form of transition and affirmation. So, then I find myself reading something that talks about how learning that you love women in a sapphic way can affirm one’s womanhood as a transfeminine person, when here I am feeling itchy and wrong and dysphoric at the idea that the way I experience love has to be gendered at all. It’s weird and hard.

Again, I want to make clear that I’m not criticizing the act of having gendered experiences. I don't think gender is inherently bad, and I don’t think that it’s petty or trivial in the way agender people can sometimes think it is. It can be easy to invalidate other people’s experiences of gendered things when you’re agender because you just don’t \*get\* it, you’re lacking the personal context and gratification of experiencing gender so it can just seem confusing and nonsensical and two dimensional in a way that it wouldn't for people who can actually experience it. But I think it’s beautiful when people express, for example, what I talked about above in relations to sapphic love feeling different than masculine or male love. I just don’t enjoy the feeling of it being compulsory, or pushed onto me. Even if it’s indirectly, via expectations about how trans people feel. It’s hard being alienated from cis people AND binary trans people. And even sometimes nonbinary people, when they lean into gendered territory. None of these experiences are wrong, but because I so rarely see my experience, it’s easy to feel like \*I’m\* the one that’s ‘wrong’ and theirs is 'right'.

TLDR: Recently read the Gender Dysphoria Bible and in some ways reading it helped, but in a lot of ways it also made me feel much worse? It leaned VERY binary/transfeminine, which in a document that kind of markets itself as relating to most trans people, isn’t the best. But it made me realize that reading about binary trans people’s experiences of gender dysphoria and transition actually makes me feel more dysphoric as an agender person because of the active focus on the experience of being gendered and gendered things when all I want is to escape gendered experiences and being gendered.

So I came out to my parents 5 weeks ago, and I've been trying different kind of looks I've done an under dye because why not. But mostly I've been experimenting with my make-up even more than usual, at first I did less make-up and it basically came down to eyeliner (underneath the eye) mascara and black lipstick. And even though I really loved that look it didn't feel like me. So for the last few days I've been trying to find what I really like and I found this amazing nose art kind of thing.

 And I love it, so today I wore it to school and since my mom is already gone in the morning and my dad isn't awake yet they can't say anything about my make-up. But when I came home from school my dad looked at me weird, and we just had dinner and my mom was here as well. And my dad said, you better take that off this evening and I said of course it's make-up I don't sleep with it. He got a bit annoyed (Maybe I was a bit rude but still) and than he said, you're not allowed to put it on tomorrow because it's not normal. And I said just because your norms and values are different than mine doesn't make it my problem. (I hope that's grammatically correct) and I continued by saying, you always say that I should be myself and do what makes me, me. But when I do and it doesn't fit your liking suddenly it's wrong. And than he said that I was being over the top and I was wrong.

Am I being an asshole, because I really like this kind of make-up and I haven't felt this kind of Euphoria in a while.

Something I feel like I should add, my parents aren't really supportive of me. I know they love my a lot, but they haven't used the other pronouns or even my name yet so that kinda pisses me off.

He got a bit annoyed (Maybe I was a bit rude but still) and than he said, you're not allowed to put it on tomorrow because it's not normal. And I said just because your norms and values are different than mine doesn't make it my problem. (I hope that's grammatically correct) and I continued by saying, you always say that I should be myself and do what makes me, me. But when I do and it doesn't fit your liking suddenly it's wrong. And than he said that I was being over the top and I was wrong.\n\nAm I being an asshole, because I really like this kind of make-up and I haven't felt this kind of Euphoria in a while.\n\nSomething I feel like I should add, my parents aren't really supportive of me. I know they love my a lot, but they haven't used the other pronouns or even my name yet so that kinda pisses me off.\n\nTldr:  I found a make-up style I like and my parents don't like it and don't want me to wear it.

I won’t go into ME, other than to say I am a woman out of ease... it’s easier to be called “she” and honestly I’m comfortable in leggings. I’m autistic, and I know a lot of us are because we tend to have different ideas of gender and breaking the gender barrier/norms. I’d say if anything I’m agender or androgynous in some ways. Makeup is my THING, I went to beauty school for skin/makeup and the makeup I wear just makes it easier for others to label me a woman. I have always had a major issue with OTHER feminine terms, however. I won’t go too far into it. My close friends and even a few exes know my struggle there. I had an eating disorder that I won’t go into more for trigger reasons, but it’s been very very incredibly hard to accept my newer “curvy, feminine” body when I was flat as a board and very underweight before.

Personally I’m also... I don’t know, I wouldn’t put a definitive label on it but I’m for sure more or less bisexual (now more like pan). I sometimes joke my sexuality is “yes”. If I’m attracted to you, I just am, whatever gender or sex you may be. I’m typically more into AMAB people, but it’s not a rule.

There’s been an NB person coming into work, and I immediately sort of took a liking to them. They are absolutely a gender iconoclast. On the phone I had no idea, and I kind of immediately thought “kindred soul” even though I’m basically in the closet.

I guess this adds a layer to my sexuality in a way, not that I mind it. I haven’t been around that many NB people. I mean I was in college a while ago and while I met plenty of straight up trans people (and yes I know NBs can be trans if the label fits). Hope that makes sense and doesn’t sound rude or anything.

For me, I am very choosy about who I’m attracted to. Not like making a choice in my head, it’s my body that makes the choice entirely. Just like.... if I am not into someone, I never will be. If I am, I really am into them.

I hope this doesn’t sound fetish-y. Like I’m taking an “androgynous” person and fetishizing them.

My name is Samantha Im a trans woman and go by She/her 

So my best friend knows I’m trans and told me to refer to them as he/they, I then asked if they would like to use They/Them, they answered with a shrug emoji, telling me that they are unsure but open to explore. Since I’ve already been through some gender stuff myself, I offered to provide some resources that helped me as well as find some others, they agreed so I brought some to their attention.

Basically I figured that the best way to find stuff that might help them figure themselves out a bit more could be to ask those that have done the same, he thinks there may be a possibility he’s NB and is open to explore It because “he may have been in more than one closet” (he’s openly gay aswell) I’m going to continue to look for stuff on my own but I would greatly appreciate anything you could offer.

Anyways, I would love to pass on anything that might help as well as any information about how I can help be a better friend (pronouns or new names are not a problem for me, I just want to be supportive as possible though)

2021-01-15 04:02:24,kxmjdl,10,1,"Or at least they/them pronouns might not be right for me. I asked my friends to use them with me, but they either don’t use them or when they do it feels forced to me. My best friend is perfect and uses they/them exclusively for me, but especially when I see his conversations where he’s talking about me and using they/them it doesn’t really feel right to me. 

When I first started trying to define my gender, I felt that genderfluid was right for me. Sometimes I felt like a boy, sometimes like a girl. Since then, I started to feel less and less comfortable being perceived as a boy. I felt like I had this femininity inside me that nobody could see or acknowledge. Then, I started hrt. First, at a really low dose and taking Tamoxifen because I was pretty sure that I didn’t want breasts, but really I was scared for people to see them and not be able to pass as cis at work. I started seeing a girl more and more when I looked in the mirror, and it made me so happy. My dysphoria has gotten worse and when I see a boy in the mirror I get horribly upset. At night, I lay in bed cupping my budding breasts so happy to have them. I look in the mirror and feel such intense euphoria when I see a girls silhouette.

For further backstory, my older sister is trans, but she’s constantly deadnamed by my family. She has a really hard life. She’s poor, depressed, agoraphobic, and she doesn’t pass.

I had a lot of anger towards her for messing up our family (though now I know she wasn’t wholly responsible). I knew on some level I was trans before she came out, and when she did, internally I was angry. I felt that I was so much more feminine than her and that if anyone should be coming out as trans it was me (and yet it still took me another 4 years to see a gender therapist 🙄). I think seeing how hard her transition has been and my own personal dislike of her (which started a decade before she came out) made me repress all my feelings about wanting to be a girl even more than being raised in an uber-conservative household did. I didn’t want to be anything like her. 

I think in one important way I am though. I don’t want to be a boy.

I started seeing a girl more and more when I looked in the mirror, and it made me so happy. My dysphoria has gotten worse and when I see a boy in the mirror I get horribly upset.

Hi, I am using an alt-account for privacy, please don't kick me.

I am afab and I came out about 5 month ago as non binary. My mom is very orthodoxe, conservative and religious (incuding homophobic and transphobic), hence I didn't tell her about. After a wholesome trip being finally away from her for a month, I decided I should just live myself out. Get a haircut, buy a binder, get fancy clothes. As my mom noticed once, that my chest is flat, she instatly started to grab it to feel what  I was wearing and shouting at me what the fuck I am doing. I could shake her off by saying ""Lemme change, just the wrong bra, get ya hands from me"".  I feel bad when I get out in public witout binder since I feel thrown back in my agab. I know that my face and voice is feminin, but I feel like the chest thingie is the worst. When my mom is home, I am forced to change my binder in the basement., so she doesn't notice.

Once I have cut my hair, she said I look like a lesbian (thanks mom), although much people said I look much better like this or more non binary, that's why didn't let it hit too much on me. 

I have expressed my mom several years before my body issues before I knew I was enby, and she made it worse. When I said ""Please don't talk about my body"" or ""I don't want to dress like this"" she was offended. She shouted at me when I refused to wear a dress or use make up for special occasions till I cried and sit there in this ugly dress, with this ugly make up and ugy feelings. Nowadays I just put my triggering cloth away, started to sell them so they get at least reused by other people. My mom is pissed by my style. She call me tasteless lmao.

After a huge argument we decided to come clean to each other. She apologized for her shitty behaviour sincere and I told her about me being non binary. She then pretended like she would die any moment or that  I have just died infront of her and calling me the whole time ""my daughter, my daughter"" when I corrected her she was like ""don't mess with me"". She didn't even want to her my new name. I tried to explain to her everything and of course I am not mad if you say accidentally the wrong name or pronoun, but it seemed like it was no help. She remained numb for that evening. On the next day she sends me female clothes, I said ""bro wtf, don't do that, you know I don't like this/ this triggers me"" She shushed me everytime I tried to correct her. Even when I asked her ""could you just please call me ""child"" instead of daughter, it hurts-"" 
""No, daughter, you are always my girl, my daughter, my little daughter."" 
Two day pass by she is being shitty and basically turning her apology invalid. She is emotional abusive and calls me the liar; the traitor and the splitter of the family. Furthermore she is forcing me to go back to being a girl. I could shake her of by telling her that I MIGHT change my mind. Now I am back at being closeted. Over the holidays it was cancer, I started to misgender myself because I was constalty in that wrong environment, where I was called with wrong pronouns, name and gender. I even started to call myself by my deadname and I hated it. Now that I have again my friends who call me right, I could focus on being myself again. My mom shouts so often and soothes me, isn't satisfied when I am depressed or start to recover. I feel like Rapunzel and her step-mother.

I told my aunt how I feel and me being nb. She said, it's just a phase  (at least I could somehow normally with her and explain myself) and she won't call me by my new name nor will she use an another pronoun. 

I am missing so much sleep because of stress and thoughts. I lost weight and when I eat I have to puke. I try to recover from depression but begin to feel empty again. I can't cry out because I don't have simply the energy for that.

2021-01-15 18:20:31,ky0dwo,9,1,"I’m just hoping to hear your success stories of coming out to your partners/spouses, even if it started out rocky or unclear.

I came out to my boyfriend of almost 3 years (committed relationship) just before the New Year, and we’ve been slowly having some heavy conversations since. What’s difficult is that I don’t have a clear idea of how I want to express myself yet. I know I’m not totally happy with my current AFAB/femme state, but I don’t want to give it up permanently. At the same time, I get feelings of dysmorphia frequently (especially during sex, and they’re clearly helped by picturing myself with the opposite parts). So I’m really undecided on what to do. 

My partner says he’s supportive and he wants me to be happy, but he also acknowledged that if I make any changes to my presentation, he will definitely have to adjust (understandable) and that for him it’s hard to see me hate the body that he loves. I get it - he had no reason before now to think I’d want to be myself but in a different body. We’re both bi, so he isn’t scared of the idea of being with a man, but neither of us can know how our relationship will be affected if the outward person he knows me to be changes. Obviously I don’t want him to make promises he can’t keep, but I told him that I can’t stop worrying I’ll lose him or my friends and that I might be making the wrong choice by allowing myself to pursue what eventually feels right. (Our social group is super progressive but also overwhelmingly cishet, so I’d be trailblazing within the group and I’m scared my friends will look down on me for being trans (lite edition), lol.) I am in therapy and my boyfriend is open to having couples sessions once I’m more familiar with my new therapist.
 
Right now, we’ve settled on him using fewer female-gendered words to describe me, and I’ve explained that sometimes I shift in my head between being his boyfriend and his girlfriend, and I can’t always predict when or why it’ll happen. But I really don’t know what comes next.

Several years ago i thought i was trans (ftm) and i presented as male but i felt uncomfortable using he/him pronouns in real life so it made me realize that i'm not ftm. I'm now presenting as a girl again, but i don't really know how i feel about it.
I kinda see boys and girls as boxes and i'm not sure how to fit into one of those.
Now this could have many reasons: being bullied in school, not finding girl nor boy friends or whatever. Also i have the problem that i watched kalvin garrah for some time (gladly out of that) but he kinda made me feel like nonbinary people are weird (?). I konow this makes no sense, i'm of course respectful of everyones pronouns and i think nb people are beautiful, but bc i have this idea that they're 'weird' i dont know if i can see myself in this.
I tried going by he him and she her but i kinda found that i'm most comfortable with they/them so i don't really know.

Can someone help me get this misconception of nb people being 'weird' (bc thats absolute bullshit) out of my head and are there other genders that use they/them pronouns that maybe could be something for me?

2021-01-16 19:33:45,kypm0l,2,1,"Hello everyone! 

I'm coming at you today with really the absence of a problem. The very epitome of ""not an issue"". And yet... it bothers me: I don't know where my dysphoria went and I am confused. 

Gender has always been an issue for me (I even built my whole carreer around this confusion) and I have been seriously exploring my gender identity for quite some time now (covid wasn't even a thing back then, can you believe?). I am going to therapy, weekly. I cut my hair. I bought a ton of new clothes I like. I experimented with names and pronouns with some close friends. I have a small collection of binders now. Recently, I have been feeling very good with myself, and very secure and sure, so I have started coming out to more people : neighbours, acquaintances, coworkers... my family doesn't know yet as I don't see them very much anyway, but I'm pretty sure they know ""something"" as they have been very careful lately (for Christmas, they bought my partner a graphic novel in which the main character can magically switch gender, saying they thought it could ""be interesting"" for the both of us. They're not subtle at this point). 

Then what's the matter, you ask? So far, I have been driven to do all of this, as are a lot of people, by a combo of dysphoria and euphoria: not doing that felt awful, doing it felt like breathing freely again, it was not so much a choice as it was a necessity, and I paved that path in hectoliters of sweat and tears. ... and I have lost that drive, the past couple of weeks. I have reached the point where I don't really feel the need to come out to people, even people I interact with on a daily basis, because I don't really mind them misgendering me. I misgender myself in my own mind a lot more  than I used to as well. I have started not minding my deadname so much, and it was sending me spiralling daily a few weeks ago. I was super-set of top surgery, and now I'm like ""yeah, or breast reduction you know, whatever is easiest"". I am not constantly harassing myself about the sound of my voice or the way I sat on that chair. None of that matters anymore. I can't bring myself to care.

Not that I mind, of course, it is super relaxing and I am having a blast living life instead of just over thinking life at every corner. But I'm not quite sure what to make of that. Did I just reach a point where enough of my life is comfortable that the rest of it doesn't weight enough to trigger dysphoria? In that case should I do more of what I'm doing? Or not risk the balance I have now? Is it a very elaborate way to prevent me from going any further as it was maybe moving a bit fast lately? Or was it all a phase? Did I just really need to find validation from my loved ones and now that I have it it doesn't really matter who I am? Was I just, if that's the case, literally faking it for attention? Am I actually cis then? It doesn't even bother me so much to write that question now, even if it would have brought so much pain before, I just need to understand what's going on. I am so lost I am sometimes slightly tempted to put on some old clothes and ask people to misgender me just to see if I can trigger some negative reaction in me - tempted but I don't do it because it hasn't been that long that I coud have forgotten how deep that shit cuts and how it doesn't turn off once it's on.

Hi folx,

I am 20 years old and have been out as a lesbian for about 8 years now. I have been questioning my gender for almost that long. All I know is I'm not a man, but other than that I feel pretty lost. Sometimes it is really distressing for me, other times I don't care as much, but over time I have found myself stressing about it more and more. Sometimes when people say ""she"" it feels wrong. Other times, I don't care as much. Sometimes I think about binding and even top surgery, other times I am content with having breasts. I think I want to be a ""wife"" someday rather than a ""spouse"" or ""partner,"" and I'm pretty comfortable when my girlfriend calls me her girlfriend (GF is honestly what I prefer), but when my mom calls me ""daughter"" and when my sister calls me ""sister"" it can feel pretty weird. One of my professors who I really like started using they/them for me without ever asking me my pronouns and I like that he does that, but sometimes they/them feels weird to me too. Ultimately, I think I like they/them more than she/her, though.

It's tough for me because my sexuality has been so clear cut for so long--I've known for sure I liked women for my entire young adult life, and that has never changed. So even though I'm already out, questioning my gender identity is just something I don't know how to handle. I also think coming out as non-binary and asking people to use different pronouns for me (I'm cool with my name; it's not very common and doesn't feel super feminine to me) would be much harder for me personally than coming out as a lesbian. I go to a historically women's college where a lot of people use they/them pronouns. My family is accepting (but probably would take a while to come around). I'm super lucky, I know, but it's still really scary. I've been waiting until I'm 100% sure it's something I need to do, but at this point I don't know if I will ever feel that way.

I just don't know if I should keep identifying as a cis woman or come out as non-binary. I love women and I find womanhood beautiful and empowering.

I am hoping this is the right place instead)\n\nHi folx,\n\nI am 20 years old and have been out as a lesbian for about 8 years now. I have been questioning my gender for almost that long. All I know is I\'m not a man, but other than that I feel pretty lost. Sometimes it is really distressing for me, other times I don\'t care as much, but over time I have found myself stressing about it more and more. Sometimes when people say ""she"" it feels wrong. Other times, I don\'t care as much. Sometimes I think about binding and even top surgery, other times I am content with having breasts. I think I want to be a ""wife"" someday rather than a ""spouse"" or ""partner,"" and I\'m pretty comfortable when my girlfriend calls me her girlfriend (GF is honestly what I prefer), but when my mom calls me ""daughter"" and when my sister calls me ""sister"" it can feel pretty weird. One of my professors who I really like started using they/them for me without ever asking me my pronouns and I like that he does that, but sometimes they/them feels weird to me too. Ultimately, I think I like they/them more than she/her, though.\n\nIt\'s tough for me because my sexuality has been so clear cut for so long--I\'ve known for sure I liked women for my entire young adult life, and that has never changed. So even though I\'m already out, questioning my gender identity is just something I don\'t know how to handle. I also think coming out as non-binary and asking people to use different pronouns for me (I\'m cool with my name; it\'s not very common and doesn\'t feel super feminine to me) would be much harder for me personally than coming out as a lesbian. I go to a historically women\'s college where a lot of people use they/them pronouns. My family is accepting (but probably would take a while to come around). I\'m super lucky, I know, but it\'s still really scary. I\'ve been waiting until I\'m 100% sure it\'s something I need to do, but at this point I don\'t know if I will ever feel that way.\n\nI just don\'t know if I should keep identifying as a cis woman or come out as non-binary. I love women and I find womanhood beautiful and empowering. Because of that I feel like I should love BEING a woman, but it doesn\'t feel completely right to me. Ultimately, in my heart of hearts, I know I\'m non-binary. However, I don\'t know if I should make people change the way they talk about me.

2021-01-20 06:30:53,l13jqy,12,1,"tldr: I might be a girl and a guy but not both at the same time. I'm too scared to lose my male body to feminizing HRT and honestly don't think I want to at CERTAIN TIMES.

I'm in my early 20s AMAB, currently living as a guy and I crossdressed a ridiculous amount of times since I was 8. I was always embarrassed to talk about this and thought it was just a sad and unfortunate mental disorder. In the past, I've been caught and shamed heavily by my mother who would call me a sick pervert with some mental disability. Father was accepting of it and tried to convince my mother even when I was young.

During college, I've been realizing that I'm not just a guy dressing up. I felt genuine happiness and bliss when I dressed up (I also have what some call autogynephilia). I thought I was a transwoman, but I didn't mind being a guy. Furthermore, the stress, discrimination, and loneliness I might experience from transitioning always held me back from actually transitioning. I was content being a guy as there were significant social benefits to being one.

Furthermore, I liked powerlifting, wanted to grow a better beard, wanted to be taller, and even wanted to get rid of my slightly noticeable gynecomastia to look masculine. After much questioning, I came out to my parents as a transwoman 4 months ago, but I took it all back the next day as I genuinely thought I was tripping and wanted to be a guy again (Father was fine with the news and my mother was in denial and crying). After I took it all back, my mind was thinking, ""Thank god, what if you actually took hormones, became infertile, lost a mother, and made your gynecomastia even more noticeable?"" The crossdressing continued for the next 4 months and the cycle of masturbation and guilt also continued (I also ingested a shit ton of THC to ""cure"" my ""mental illness"" because THC made me content with whatever stage of life I was in). During this time, I did my usual routine, which consisted of reading, YouTube, lifting, cardio, and dieting.

As 2021 came around, I quit THC as I needed to piss clean for grad school. Fast forward to 1/12/21, I felt like a girl again and actually wanted to transition (Or at least see what it would feel like so I wouldn't regret it later) before I started school. I came out to my parents a second time. My father was fine (He tried to understand and learn more about gender/sexuality despite being ridiculously conservative), but my mother cut ties. I felt kind of sad, but still was motivated to transition.

That night, I was walking outside with my accepting brother and I genuinely didn't want to be a girl. I felt like a guy, wanted to live like a guy, and had no desire to be a girl. My mind was yelling, ""Am I crazy for actually wanting to be a girl? I actually don't feel like a girl at all! I don't want to be a girl in my future job! I'm giving up all my accomplishments by turning into a girl? Heck no... What about my transphobic friends?"" It is pertinent to note that I did not have post orgasm guilt as I did not masturbate that day. As these thoughts raced through my mind at light speed, the idea of bigender flashed across my mind. I quickly did a google search and felt like that was a good description for what I am and what I was feeling. I felt like a guy at times, but at other times I felt like a girl and genuinely wanted to be a girl.

Today, I had feelings of wanting to be a girl again and dressed up as usual. I explored the concept of being bigendered/genderfluid and couldn't help but feel like I was a mentally disabled person with some sort of messed up multiple gender/personality disorder... At this point in time, I probably will desist from transitioning and go for a femboy/androgynous style in the future (I already have a small frame with a lot of feminine bodily and facial features thanks to neoteny).

I have a lot of internalised fatphobia and a not-great relationship with food. For this reason, I’m aware that focusing on weight loss could be negative for me in regards to mental health, because currently I’m battling with the part of the that wants to lose weight because I hate my body (mostly because of its fatness) and not because I love it and want to be more comfortable in it. And every time I look into weight loss resources or journeys, there’s a lot of things that I find personally triggering – a focus on calorie counting, strict unsustainable diets, moulding your body to look like someone else’s/’body goals’, and just the overemphasis on appearance over health and sustainability. These things may work for some, but not for me. I also have depression, and have a lot of shame connected to exercise because I can’t do super intense workouts or ‘push myself’ as much as I seem to need to (barely any energy) and the very all-or-nothing approach to working out is just super discouraging to me.

2021-01-21 06:17:09,l1sm6r,7,1,"First of all, don’t know if i should be posting this on an alopecia areata subreddit but i just need to vent.

I just had a meeting with my boss yesterday, after not working since june 2020. since then i’ve had 3 psych hospital admissions and it’s 2021 and a lot of the procedures have changed.

I also have ADHD and C-PTSD and my history of punctuality has been....’consistently inconsistent’, especially leading up to my first hospital admission.

I work at a pharmacy and my boss offered me the opportunity to do unpaid ‘retraining’ shifts, and if I could prove to be reliable and punctual during them, he’d give me a good reference for my next job application (so I was essentially let go of too).

The catch is I have alopecia and have been wearing a long, femme wig with a fringe for the 3 years I’ve been there. It’s hot where I live and it’s like wearing a super hot beanie at all times. Plus, since early 2020 and realising I was nonbinary, it’s been conflicting with my gender identity and giving me big gender dysphoria.

I asked him if I could just work without my wig on (my hair is about 70-80% covered but shaved) and he said no because 1. it looks too ‘alternative’ and 2. patients would assume I was having chemotherapy. I actually thought with my binder and a male uniform and my shaved, patchy head, it might make me look more approachable as a dispensary assistant, especially since we give out hormone therapy to trans patients medically transitioning.

Is this fair? Should I go to the unpaid shifts with my wig on for a good reference on my resume? What would you think if you saw someone like me working as a pharmacy assistant?

For some background: I haven’t been questioning my gender for a long time, I’ve only recently started to question it (like within the the past 2-3 months). I’m AMAB and currently 16, about to turn 17 in less than a month. I’m currently out to friends and my mom as just gay but I’m starting to think it’s more than that. I’ve also been dealing with issues regarding my sexuality, but that’s a topic for another post on a different sub. I’m also currently presenting as male with little to no androgyny. My pronouns are he/they, but most people use he/him and I don’t really raise any objections to it nor see too much of a problem with it 

Ok, now to get to the question at hand. I don’t have any specific terms to describe my gender, so I’ll describe it the best way I can. To put it simply, the idea of people not knowing whether I’m a guy or a girl is something that I want. To exist in that state would be phenomenal, really. I don’t really find any major discomfort in being perceived as male, but I would say I feel apathy with a tinge of discomfort. Most people call me by my name anyways, so I think that’s why I haven’t had the time to really sit with it. As for my body, I don’t have any dysphoria except with my genitalia. But even then, my feelings are kind of mixed. Some days I wish I didn’t have what I have down there, other days I’m okay with it. I never really have liked the genitalia that I have, looking back I’ve always been just “meh” about it. Maybe I’ve grown complacent or am just scared of my feelings, I really don’t know. Another thing I’ve noticed over the past couple of months is that when I see tiktoks of like specifically semi-androgynous alt girls, I wish I looked like them. But even then, I don’t know if it’s that I want to look like them or dress like them?

2021-01-21 16:20:09,l21mp1,13,1,"Hey there! I realized that some of you guys may not know this information, so I decided to share what I know about this topic. This is all stuff that I came across while kinda hyperfixating on transition options and care. I may update this later or add more links in the future, so we'll see how that goes. I do know some stuff about AMAB transitioning, but I wouldn't consider it an area of expertise. I have italicized the part that may interest AMABs.

Please remember that I am not a doctor, and to take care of your body :) \[Also TW, bc mentions of genitals and some other stuff\]

**Chest:**

Binders and KT tape can be used to flatten the chest, and of course you can chop those things off. *While lactation may be able to provide some growth for those who want a bit more of a chest.*

**Periods and avoiding children:**

You can stop or delay them. Please remember (if you are sexually active) that no birth control method is 100% effective, and you will still be at risk for STDS (unless you use condoms). Also, T doesn't stop pregnancy. You can still take hormonal birth control with estrogen in it while on T, as it shouldn't affect it. However, there are birth control methods that don't contain estrogen if that is what you'd prefer.

  
The pill: 91% effective at preventing babies. May come with a week of sugar pills (that do nothing), or only contain active pills. Active pills are what's preventing ovulation. Taking only the active pills delays (skips) the period, because no egg=no period. May have spotting in the first few months. Can lighten period.

The patch: 91% effective at preventing babies. Lasts a week. May have spotting in the first few months. Can lighten and skip periods.

The ring: 91% effective at preventing babies. Lasts a month. May have spotting in the first few months. Can lighten and skip periods.

Depo-Provera shot: 94% effective at preventing babies. Lasts 3 months. No estrogen in this. Lightens your period. After a year, **may** stop your period.

Implant: 99% effective at preventing babies. Lasts 5 years. Goes into your arm and lasts. No estrogen in this. Can lighten/stop your period.

IUD: 99% effective at preventing babies. There are copper ones (Paragard), and hormonal ones (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla). Paragard will last 12 years. Mirena and Liletta last 7. Kyleena lasts 5 years. Skyla lasts 3 years. Only hormonal IUDs can lighten/stop your period.

Other forms of birth control don't do anything to your period. Here's some helpful links to help you learn more about birth control [https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control), [https://www.teenvogue.com/story/things-to-know-about-birth-control-trans-non-binary](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/things-to-know-about-birth-control-trans-non-binary), [https://powertodecide.org/news/how-birth-control-can-help-gender-dysphoria](https://powertodecide.org/news/how-birth-control-can-help-gender-dysphoria)

**Bottom growth:**

You can get creams to grow your clit, and you can pump. Depending on how much cream you put, you can limit masculinizing effects to just that area. If the dosage is a bit too high, the hormones may cause facial hair growth and other side effects (although this will probably be quite mild). You can take a look at r/GrowYourClit and r/GrowYourTDick for examples and information. Many people do say that it's usually not covered by insurance.

**Bottom surgery (AFAB):**

You can get bottom surgery if you're nonbinary. There's options for metoidioplasty and phalloplasty. You can also get a scrotum, testicular implants, urethral lengthening and an erectile device. You can also keep all of your female genitalia. You can also choose whether you'd like to keep your clit where it is or bury it in the new dick. You can also choose whether you want it behind the balls.

 If you want to get urethral lengthening, so that you can pee out of your fab new dick, most surgeons will require you to forfeit your vagina. This is because of complications, although I have seen an example of one guy who got it (but he didn't get balls) (user chinchilla meat on tumblr). The scrotum is constructed using your outer labia, this can put you at a greater risk for UTIs since you don't have much of a barrier down there anymore. But good hygiene, and peeing after sex, can help reduce the risk. 

With Phalloplasty, they may take the skin graft from your arm, leg, back, torso... It depends. But it's good to know there are options if you would prefer to be discreet and keep the scar a secret.

r/phallo is a good place to check out these options, as well as the surgeons clinic webpage.

**Funding:**

You can see if your workplace insurance covers your transition cost, or you can check out this website if you're attending/planning to attend an American college : [https://www.campuspride.org/tpc/student-health-insurance/](https://www.campuspride.org/tpc/student-health-insurance/) Please keep in mind that some of the stuff on that page may be outdated/inaccurate, and double checking on the college's website is a good idea. If you are planning to attend an institution in a different country, then you should also try to see how that country/regions healthcare system works.

2021-01-23 19:11:46,l3i7bg,12,1,"Hello all! I am a non-binary teacher. I would love to hear your thoughts on some questions about single-gender classes.

What are (or were) your experiences with single-gender classes in school? Would you feel safe or comfortable in a ‘boys’ or ‘girls’ class? What positives or negatives are there?

I teach choir, and it is very common to have separate classes for boys and girls. There may also be mixed-gender classes, but often those are the most advanced groups, while the ‘beginner’ and ‘intermediate’ choirs are gender-segregated. Sometimes even then the mixed choirs still meet as separate single-gender classes, and only come together for a few rehearsals and the performances.

Ostensibly, this is due to typical cisgender voice ranges (the vast majority of cis girls sing soprano/alto, while the vast majority of cis boys go through a more drastic voice change and sing tenor/bass). The argument is that separating them means the teacher can make their instruction on vocal technique more specialized to different voice types, and also they can use class time more efficiently (easier to teach 2 voice parts at a time vs 3 or 4).

There has been some effort to change terminology from “women’s choir” and “men’s choir” to “treble choir” and “tenor/bass choir.” However, I still feel that these often end up being de facto gender-segregated groups and put the burden on trans/non-binary folx to conform or compromise. Does a trans girl with a baritone range try to use her falsetto in the treble choir, or join the 98%-cis-male tenor-bass choir? Does a transmasc non-binary student who feels safer in the company of boys get to be in the tenor-bass choir even though they can’t comfortably sing low enough for the tenor part, or does the teacher encourage them to be in the treble choir because ‘that’s what’s best for your voice?’

Whether you’ve been in choir or another single-gender class (e.g. PE, sports) or not, I would love to hear any thoughts you have! As a non-binary person myself, this is something I think about a lot, and I want my classes to be as inclusive, affirming, and accessible as possible! ❤️",NonBinaryTalk,Feelings about single-gender classes in middle/high school?,1611454306.0,"{'created_utc': 1611429106, 'id': 'l3i7bg', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello all!

2021-01-23 19:44:29,l3iwfc,1,1,"Hey friends! 👋🏻 In a previous post I asked if you all would be interested in my weekly low dose T updates and I received a lot of great feedback so I thought I would share my experience so far. 

Little background info: I’m 30, transmac, on low dose T gel (20.25) daily. Hx of anxiety and PMDD (basically PMS on steroids) but no other health conditions to my knowledge. I’ve been gender nonconforming most of my life but due to growing up in a small town I never explored my identity until later in life. Decided I was non-binary and wanted to try low dose T to help alleviate some dysphoria/emotional imbalances. So far I’ve been on T for 1 week and here are some changes I’ve noticed: 

Mental: This has been the biggest change I’ve noticed and my favorite so far. I feel more calm and connected to my emotions than I did before I started. I used to let little things ruin my whole day but now I can separate myself from the emotion and change my mood pretty quickly. I feel a mind/body connect that I didn’t previously feel; I was chronically clumsy and felt like a floating head more than anything. Now I feel like a person with a physical and mental presence. 

Physical: I think the first thing I noticed here was my skin feeling slightly rougher/thicker and a little more oily. It’s not noticeable to others but I can feel it. No acne so far and I hope I can avoid that with my current skin care routine. My skin/muscles feel a little more firm. Body hair hasn’t really changed but I think my eyebrows seem a little thicker. I haven’t noticed any sweating and if anything I’ve been colder than usual but it’s freezing where I live so that could be contributing. My appetite has increased slightly and I can definitely eat more in one sitting. No voice changes but my throat does get dry and scratchy more easily. I believe bottom growth happened on day 2 and increases a small bit each day, nothing crazy though. 

It’s only been a week and my dose is very low so results will take time but I’m very pleased with my experience so far. I hope these post help and I’m happy to answer any questions.

I hear a lot about how trans women are the ones who get killed, but I don't really see much of an attempt to center the trans women who *actually get murdered*: trans women of color.

* You shouldn't be attracted to a trans person's ""factory-installed"" genitals
* You aren't supposed to admire trans people for having qualities associated with their AGAB
* You shouldn't be looking for the ""best of both worlds""

For the past 2 years I've been considering top surgery (I'm afab). I've always felt uncomfortable with my chest area, I literally squash them as flat as I can when I look in the mirror before and after I get out of the shower - so, yeah, I really want them gone. But the thing is, I don't want to take hormones/HRT. I've taken HRT before for \~3 months and just felt like I was just transitioning from one binary to another; it just felt all wrong. I feel like it's pretty common for NB persons to take hormones, like it's kind of a ""must do"" in order to be validated as ""actually"" NB. I already feel pretty invalidated enough as I do present more femme most days and because I present with what's expected of my assigned gender, I can't be NB. (But also it's safer for me to present more femme in the area I live in, if I had my way I'd be more androgynous) 

Anyway, back to top surgery. I've recently told only my sister and my partner, and my sister thinks I should just go for a breast reduction. I just don't feel like that would honestly help me with my dysphoria, and while sometimes I like my honkers during woohoo time, I genuinely don't feel any sort of attachment or connection towards them as I'd feel a cis woman would? Like they're just there, not really supposed to be there. Idk, the best way I could describe it is like having moved into an apartment, you know you're going to move on someday so you don't become too attached, not like owning a home. I don't know. They're just these annoying bags and while they're fun sometimes I honestly could do without.

Is there anyone else that feels this strongly about chopping off their own, but no desire to take hormones? And for those who have gotten top surgery, aren't on any hormones, how did you go about getting a doctor to actually go along with the surgery? I feel like a lot of docs require you to take HRT (or some sort of other medical reason) before going forth.

I just don\'t feel like that would honestly help me with my dysphoria, and while sometimes I like my honkers during woohoo time, I genuinely don\'t feel any sort of attachment or connection towards them as I\'d feel a cis woman would? Like they\'re just there, not really supposed to be there. Idk, the best way I could describe it is like having moved into an apartment, you know you\'re going to move on someday so you don\'t become too attached, not like owning a home. I don\'t know. They\'re just these annoying bags and while they\'re fun sometimes I honestly could do without.\n\nIs there anyone else that feels this strongly about chopping off their own, but no desire to take hormones? And for those who have gotten top surgery, aren\'t on any hormones, how did you go about getting a doctor to actually go along with the surgery? I feel like a lot of docs require you to take HRT (or some sort of other medical reason) before going forth. \n\nAnd, I\'m just trying to find more people to relate with.

I came out to myself as nb a couple months ago and am now just feeling wish washy about it all/wanted to know if any others have had a similar experience:

I don’t know whether or not I struggle with dysphoria really. There are a lot of days my facial hair and bushy eyebrows make me feel gross inside.

Im growing increasingly more tired of being addressed as man/sir at work. One day I thought I heard someone address me as ma’am and I felt a lot of things - not exactly sure what. 

I’ve always been drawn to people who present in a gender-non conforming way. Not in a physical attraction necessarily, but more of a magnetization to them as a human that can exist. Sometimes it manifests as jealousy and sometimes as admiration.

Do cis people question gender like this? 

I dunno if I’m just not letting myself embrace this/come out to friends because I feel like it would be a hassle on their end to use different pronouns and change the way they see me.

Has anyone had luck with dating straight men? I was in a relationship with a straight man and fell in love with him but he left me after I had top surgery. He knew about it before we started dating and went above and beyond to be supportive of me because he saw how excited I was about it. He was also, and still is, an amazing and supportive enby ally and did so much to show me he liked me for me and didn't just see me as a tomboy girl. Idk how to get that across but he wasn't pushing me into the ""woman's roll"" of the relationship and genuinely sees me as nonbinary which was a big green flag for me.

I had to go home (across the country) to get my surgery and when I came back he didn't seem interested in me anymore and ended up breaking up with me (there was an added layer of complication with it being his first poly relationship as well but that's not the problem at hand). There's a piece of me that hopes he'll realize he made a mistake in leaving me and we'll be able to try again (also as monogamous but again not the point) after some time to ""reacquaint"" ourselves but my boobs aren't coming back.

The only times I feel comfortable with my chest is when I wear a bralette and dress in a feminine way, or wear a chest/torso binder to flatten my chest completely. My chest has been a constant issue in my life that I’ve obsessed over since I was 12-13.

Basically, I'm some kind of AFAB non-binary person with lifelong chest dysphoria, but masculinizing my chest isn't remotely the impetus behind my strong desire to remove my C-cup boobs. I have always wanted them off, since they arrived. They're like actual baggage i have to carry around.

But... I don't see pictures of folks' top surgery results and think, ""wow i want that"" --- in fact, usually i think to myself, ""that's cool, but i don't want that at all, I'm not a man."" Then i just feel kinda hopeless, like i have to choose between having these stupid things on me and looking like a dude.

I have only ever heard of a ""radical reduction"" in recent months, and have only seen one example of it. To be fair, it was a great example... their boobies came out perfectly tiny and appear lightweight af, which seems like my dream. But I'm worried that i won't be able to get results like that, cuz what do I even ask for? Also, since mine are so saggy and bigger than a B cup, any full mastectomy i get will have some real scars... So maybe that's a reason to only get them reduced?

I'd be lying if i said there wasn't a small part of me that wants to take advantage of that good-good male privilege of walking around shirtless. That's the one benefit to full top surgery i can think of, and maybe that's enough to outweigh the negatives. 

I like being able to present femme af, cuz i do like my female identity. It's just not all of me, and it's like the titties keep me stuck there. I can still wear dresses with nothing there, right? Ppl will prolly assume I'm a cancer survivor. Which is... ok i guess? Idk man.

i know there’s no specific way to be nonbinary, yet i still don’t feel i’d be valid. i’m noticing many things - such as, i hate gender rules yet i still follow them. probably because i spent so long following them that they’re a part of me now. i’m the most feminine person ever and love that, but hate that people will see me as a girl and restrict me to female gender rules.

i also don’t feel connected to gendered titles such as “woman”, “lady”, “miss”, etc. but girl is okay. not sure if that’s cuz i have a childish mindset and body, or if i genuinely don’t want to take on those titles.

i think back to when i was a kid and felt more in touch with guys, my reasoning was that girls do boring stuff like paint their nails while boys did fun things like cause mischief. now i know that that way of thinking is dumb - your gender doesn’t define what you do. but it still means i feel disconnected from femininity 

not sure if this is just a phase and i’m being influenced by all my nonbinary friends. that’s how i felt about my bisexuality for a while too, that i wasn’t valid and just being influenced by my gay friends. but i am definitely bi, so maybe this isn’t a valid argument?

and a final thought that has been coming up a lot: i’m not a gender abolitionist for society because i know so many people find comfort in their gender, but i’m a gender abolitionist for myself

i already have talked to my sister about wanting one and we have pages and everything and i can buy one but i now feel ashamed and feel selfish for being like this, my mom is really caring and she was nice to me the most of the time, she is also one of the only persons i have confidence to talk to in the family and it feels like shit to not be the daughter she wanted to have, maybe im overthinking but i dont want her to grow distant and dont want to talk to me anymore
i keep playing and lying about 'im like this because i like to look masculine, but that doesnt me make stop being a girl' i know im not a girl but i have to keep playing the tomboy role and oh damn it feels good to write all off here

That situation made me realize that ""allies"" only support trans and bipoc people if they shut up and take their bigotry.

1. What are some ""triggers"" for your gender moods? Is it something where some days you feel like being one gender? Or are there certain activities that make you feel a certain gender?
2. What concrete effects does your gender mood have? Do you change your presentation? Or is it kind of an internal thing?
3. What does dysphoria look like for you?
4. What pronouns do you use?

Here are my own personal answers:

1. It's really something where I feel like being a masculine for a few days and then feminine for a few days.
2. Generally, I grow facial hair when I'm in a masculine mood. I wear makeup more when I'm in a feminine mood. I'm training my voice so I can change that as well.
3. Generally, dysphoria for me stems from not having agency in my gender or having difficulty with the idea that I have to choose between estrogen and testosterone.

2021-01-31 08:00:34,l97th9,6,1,"I have been thinking about getting ftm top surgery for a long time and I know one day I will want to get top surgery or a radical breast reduction. I will often have periods of time where I feel 100% sure that I'd rather have top surgery and that it would make me the most comfortable with myself...however there are a couple of things about it that make me take a step back and go back to considering radical breast reduction instead. 

One of the things is completely unavoidable with top surgery: loss of nipple sensation. It makes me sad that to be the most comfortable with my body that I can be, I would have to completely give up 2 big erogenous zones that even people born without breasts have! My sexuality is important to me and it might seem silly to some people to care a lot about that but it is really sad to think about having to give up a whole experience for the rest of my life just so I don't have really bad dysphoria. 

The other thing is just a weird, vague feeling I get that comes and goes but it makes me feel worried about surgery. I am a nonbinary femme and I like being feminine in some ways and I love women a lot! And I feel like sometimes my connection to women and my appreciation and attraction to women confuses me about how I feel about my body. Even if I have chest dysphoria almost all of the time and I do not like being aware of my chest and I wish it wasn't there and I don't like being automatically viewed as a woman, some part of me worries sometimes that I won't feel feminine enough with no boobs? This might just be internalized misogyny too (god knows I've had to work through a lot of that to accept my trans-ness). Like... breasts are typically seen as feminine and I have this weird feeling that my connection to femininity will somehow be severed without them. I also just worry about missing them in general... they are a part of me and despite the discomfort they cause every day, I still don't completely hate them! I enjoy having them sometimes and I like the idea of them being soft and nice to lay on and I think they look good on me. They just don't feel right and I don't think they are for me and on an everyday basis I think I'd be happier without them. Even knowing that, it it just scary to commit to such a big change to my body. 

The problems with just getting a breast reduction though are that it only partially solves some of my issues with my current chest, I don't know if I'd even be able to get small enough for my liking, AND it would cost way more money (because I don't think I'd qualify to have a breast reduction covered by insurance but I could for top surgery). I don't think I WANT to have small breasts...it'd just be better than having large ones. I would have nipple sensation but I still might be unhappy with my chest.

It's just difficult because there's not really a way to experiment with what I would like more, it feels like I just have to commit to one thing and hope it's the right choice. Due to my chest size and how unproportional it is with the rest of my body, binding is not very effective at all (it is barely better than just wearing a sports bra) and obviously I can't experiment with just having small boobs. I love the idea of having a flat chest in so many ways... it's just also scary and I don't know if I will ever feel 110% sure about it. I wish I did or I wish I could just be ok with how my chest is now but I've been trying for years now and I just can't.

2021-01-31 16:48:16,l9g5ex,20,140,"I keep seeing posts talking about the euphoria of fellow enbies cutting their hair, and it makes me super happy to see them celebrating that moment of transformation! But it also got me thinking: that liberating moment will unfortunately never come for me, simply because I’m assigned male at birth, and trying to grow my hair out.

Instead, my transformation is a process. Just like my hair, I’m growing every day... becoming more and more comfortable and knowledgeable with who I am. Since November, I’ve come out to my parents, acapella group, brother, and other friends. I’ve found a powerful ally in my lesbian aunt, who promises to help me navigate potentially difficult extended family dynamics. I’ve bought some clothes from the woman’s section of Kohl’s and Lord &amp; Taylor’s. And most impactfully, I watched She Ra and the princesses of power, causing me to rethink my approach to loving people. Also the themperor known as Double Trouble. They are just... exactly who I needed to see. It almost feels like my hair has doubled in length since then!

Now, I’ve been growing my hair out for a while. Back when I last had my hair cut, I was still stomping out the fires of my homophobic upbringing. I was raised christian, and somewhere in my youth, I concluded that it was wrong to be gay. The scary part was that my church, high school youth group and mother didn’t explicitly instill this principle (at least not directly) - I concluded this by my own 14 year old self. But fortunately, little by little, this mindset died out, thanks to a genuine desire for understanding instilled in me by Steven Universe. I seeked out answers, talked to LGBTQ people, and even talked to Christian leaders. The ones that revealed themselves as homophobes did so in a way that unsettled me. I knew I was wrong. And by the time I decided to grow my hair out, there was just a small dying homophobic ember just begging to be stepped on, which finally happened when I watched season one of Kipo.

I’m not entirely sure why I wanted to grow my hair out, long before I knew I was an Enby. I think I just wanted to try something different at first. It  just... felt right. I had an image in my head of what I wanted to look like, which was subconsciously pushing me toward who I am now. And now for Christmas, my mother, who I thought was just another homophobe, got me hair ties that I didn’t even ask for. Putting my hair in a ponytail for the first time felt... well, like those who just cut their hair on this sub must have felt in their moment.

Hair grows anywhere from just 0.2 to 0.7 inches every month, but it’s always growing.... and that’s how I feel. So every day I look at my Double Trouble poster on my bedroom wall, or refer to myself using “they”, or tell someone new about my identity... I’m growing too.

Putting my hair in a ponytail for the first time felt... well, like those who just cut their hair on this sub must have felt in their moment.\n\nHair grows anywhere from just 0.2 to 0.7 inches every month, but it’s always growing.... and that’s how I feel. So every day I look at my Double Trouble poster on my bedroom wall, or refer to myself using “they”, or tell someone new about my identity... I’m growing too.\n\nMy gender is me - and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nEdit: spelling', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'My symbolic hair story', 'created': 1612136896.0}"

2021-01-31 19:54:41,l9keel,30,121,"So - I've been having a really shitty day with dysphoria today. Just feel disconnected and awful in my body and the idea that people will always see me as female bothers me. I decided to watch a YouYube video of a nonbinary person talk about their identity and dealing with being misgendering assuming it would be comforting. Turned out to he the exact opposite lol. 

Their response to constant misgendering was essentially that they got over it, accepted their body as 'female', realized that most people don't know what genderqueer is and understandably see them as female and therefore didn't deserve frequent correcting about pronouns (including close people like family). A lot of people in the comments agreed by saying they felt the same way. None of that in and of itself really bothered me but there seemed to be this consensus that asking people to use your correct pronouns and correcting them and actually feeling hurt or caring about being misgendered was being 'demanding?'. Or like social dysphoria, which is the kind of dysphoria I primarily experience, is equivalent to being insecure and whiny and that you just need to get over it and stop putting so much pressure on people. That somehow being AFAB and feminine means that you just have to accept that most people will call you 'she' and stop feeling bad about it because you obviously place too much value in what others think of you and you aren't owed the respect of using the correct pronouns if you look feminine and are AFAB - it's too confusing for cis people to see someone who looks like a woman not using female pronouns.  

And the thing is - on a certain level, in certain situations, that may be something you have to accept. If you are feminine and AFAB most people will call you she or misgender you. Even androgynous nonbinary people deal with this. Coping with being misgendered long term is just a part of being nonbinary, unfortunately. But to me there's a ginormous difference between acknowledging that society is like this as a result of misunderstanding, ignorance and transphobia, and that it is something you have to cope with vs. framing it in a way that makes nonbinary people seem immature or demanding for wanting to be seen and understood as what they actually are. Cis people receive that understanding, heck even binary trans people can get that because a lot of people can wrap their head around binary genders. So how the fuck is it demanding or unfair for nonbinary people to want this too?? Is it our fault society just doesn't understand us?? 

It's not my fucking fault I have a gender that's so strange and bizarre to so many people. It's not my fucking fault that there is no visual way to present as my gender, and that transition into a body that will get me acknowledged as what I actually am seems impossible. I didn't choose to be this way. And some days I'd kill to be a cis woman who could just take this shit for granted, or even a nonbinary person who just didn't care, or even a nonbinary person who had only body dysphoria and pursued gender affirming healthcare for themselves and not because they wanted people to percieve them in a particular way. But I'm not that. I'm *this*. And hearing that correcting people on pronouns, or feeling hurt, is somehow immaturity or insecurity or whatever other bullshit personality flaw they made it out to be, hurt so much. ESPECIALLY today. Like it already hurts enough to have cis people treat you like you're demanding and like you don't make sense just for being the way you naturally are. But to hear that rhetoric coming out of other nonbinary people's mouths really fucked me up. It made me feel like I wasn't allowed to exist the way I am, with all the emotions I have about my situation and not being gendered correctly. It made me feel oversensitive and stupid for what is ultimately me just wanting people to address me correctly. It made me feel irrational for being an AFAB who looks feminine and doesn't like being called a woman. Like because I'm too complex to make sense to cis people, I just don't make sense at all.

Yes I understand that we need to be understanding and patient of others when they get it wrong. And I understand that over time, it might be productive to find better ways to express these emotions or find ways to become more resilient and thick skinned about  being misgendered. Lots of nonbinary people choose to pick their battles and are just out to people close to them or don't even change their pronouns. That's fair. Not everyone wants to invest all their energy into correcting and teaching people. But some of us can't do that (because dysphoria, etc), don't want to, and just feel it is worth it to push for nonbinary visibility or to have the right to live as openly as any other gender. Like I said cis people get their gender respected and acknowledged, so why they fuck shouldn't we? How is it demanding too much when *we* do it? How else does change come about? (Not directed at all people who do this, I'm in the same situation but) Stay closeted or keep your pronouns if you want, but don't fucking tell other nonbinary people that they are being demanding or whiny because they struggle with something you don't or want to live openly.

To end - I didn't need to hear that when I was already hurting. Gaslighting today of all days. And that's what it is - being gaslighted into thinking that because I'm too 'complicated' for cis people to understand, I'm simply not allowed to have those emotions. That it's *unreasonable*. Like a binary trans person who is cis passing can ask for their correct pronouns, and have them respected no problem, but I can't because that's too """"""confusing""""""?

I just need someone to tell me I'm not insane for being angry or struggling so much with social dysphoria and a disconnect between my gender and my body that can't be majorly solved by transition. I need someone to say that I make sense even if I'm AFAB and wear feminine clothing and don't like being seen as a woman. That that *isn't* unreasonable, that cis people need to expand their understanding of gender instead of me having to shrink to fit it. That as a trans nonbinary person I'm *allowed* to take up space. I've said all these things to myself, but I'd appreciate support.

* EDIT: Just wanted to clarify - this isn't about me genuinely believing that every single person I come across will gender me correctly and me being disappointed that this doesn't happen. I know that isn't realistic and that's not what this is even really about. this was me venting about how I felt at the time.

For the most part, most of my life is going to be focused on finding ways to be comfortable and happy in my body (with or without affirming surgery) and in my gender because I know I'm not going to be affirmed or seen for who I am. I just don't appreciate the callousness and victim blaming of telling someone to 'just get over it' or implying that it is *their* fault for having the desire to be treated with the same dignity and respect as others. Like I said, it's one thing to tell nonbinary people to focus on ways to be resilient and cope with misgendering in a world that doesn't respect them and to find internal peace however they can, VS. telling nonbinary people that they are the ones who are demanding and irrational. This is way more about how nonbinary people feel about themselves and their relationship to being misgendered/disrespected/misunderstood than it is about how people are actually going to treat us. Like I said, most of us are just *going* to have to cope with being misgendered long term. So some naive expectation that that isn't going to happen was never what this was about.
