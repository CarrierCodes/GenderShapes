2012-02-04 16:20:00,paps3,41,14,"So, let me explain the situation a bit, then ask for some input.

I knew this girl. When we met she identified, publicly anyway, as a lesbian. Then she began to publicly identify as a man. She didn't take hormones or change her style of dress, which was already pretty neutral - the main difference, as far as it concerned me, was that now one said he.

This was difficult for me, not emotionally but linguistically, shall we say. This person still looks like a girl. I was taught young to look at a girl and say ""she"". I made the attempt to change, still slipped up from time to time, but it wasn't the hardest thing I ever had to do.

At the time I did a little reading on gender identity disorder. I read through /r/asktransgender. Reading more about trans people got the empathy flowing a bit, and that was nice.

This person has come out now, for the second time, this time as gender neutral. The preferred pronoun is now ""they"". One is supposed to say ""When is they coming?"", ""Ask they if they wants some"".

I'm not here to pick a fight. I kind of want to be more on board than I am. Maybe hear me out, and then tell me what you think. 

If I try to say those things out loud, they just sound wrong. While I could possibly, in time, rewire myself, I must admit there is part of me that is inclined to kind of be like, you know what? No. I'm not sure I'm on board with creating new categories in my head because of how your gender feels this year.

This person isn't annoying generally. It's not like I feel he/she/they is just trying to mess with me. Maybe I painted myself into a corner mentally, in attempting to empathize by asking myself if I would be able to ""just go with it"" if I woke up tomorrow in a body of the opposite gender. But there is a point at which I would stop participating. It might be if she she starts inventing her own pronouns, or switching them up. It might be if she changes her name to a symbol. Or now. I dunno.

1) How bad a guy am I for being just annoyed by this, and almost kind of wanting to be like, you know what, I'm not so sure. You all are the more gender progressive people I am aware of, so I thought it would be interesting to hear what you think. I hope you won't take my frankness as rudeness. 

2) Does anyone have any input that might make me understand why he/she/they doing this is more okay than it seems right away? I don't wanna be a jerk - in a way I'd prefer to be on board, but I find it so tiring and boring, honestly, for the amount of attention and vigilance that's being asked of me.

What it comes down to, I think, is that at root I am offended because I would never ask acquaintances to do something like for me; but the golden rule isn't as golden as they say, as but people can be massively different.

I am a 19 year old college student, and for one of my psychology classes (The psychology of women and gender), we were told to interview a woman to get a different viewpoint on some of the issues we have been discussing this year. We were told to find someone who was pretty different form us, so I thought it would be really interesting if I could interview a transgendered person, preferable a transwoman. I don't know anyone who I could interview, so I decided reddit would be a great way to find someone. 

I will, of course, completely respect your privacy about this issue, and in my interview paper, I will not use names or anything else. I will also be willing to link you to my twitter page (via PM) if needed. 

UPDATE: Thanks for all the people who were willing to participate in my interview! Did not expect this many responses actually, another reason why Reddit is so amazing. I was told to do another post detailing what I have learned via the interview, which I will definitely do! My interview paper is not due until April, since we have to apply concepts from our class to the paper, but I will probably be conducting the interview within the next two weeks, and do another post later (as long as my interviewee is comfortable with that).

2012-02-05 05:07:40,pbitn,2,3,"hey everybody... I'm sort of new here, and am frankly having a bit of a crisis. First of all, I should probably start off by saying that by technical standards, I'm a female. Born with tits and bits and all that fun junk. 

With that said, I'm not sure what I am, at the root of it all. I've never really identified either way, though if I had to strongly identify with a gender, it'd be male. And I'm constantly daydreaming/fantasizing about myself as a male.. I always have, even when I was young. But I sort of thought that was normal.

Growing up I forced myself into girly things and even now, I still hold up that charade even though I don't feel like femininity entirely suites me. I have no qualms with calling myself a girl or having girl parts, but in a strange way, it doesn't really feel like I'm referring to myself, like that female part of me is an entirely separate person from who I actually am.

When I think about myself, I'm always thinking of myself as this strong, confident man. Outgoing, courageous, all that... And it feels like an ideal me I'll never obtain. I'm far too afraid to go through with surgery and transitioning, and ultimately, I don't think I could ever deal with the stress of telling my friends and family any of this. When I came out as bisexual, my parents took it like a ton of bricks, and I've since taken up persuing males even though that isn't what my heart wants... But that's another story entirely.

Either way, I'm feeling lost and confused and I just don't enjoy my life anymore. I hate feeling this way, I hate feeling like I'm constantly lying to myself and others and just being unhappy with myself.

I...don't really ever plan what i write with these things, so expect some strange structures, its just really me typing as i think so that i dont censor myself without realising it. So i'll get straight to the point.


I'm transexual, Male to Female, i realised this 5 years ago back when i was 13. Over the years, i've kinda pushed it aside in my head because, while looking back this was stupid, it seemed like the best thing to do for my own personal welfare. As of February 2011, i confidently came to the conclusion about who i am, and came out to my Girlfriend of 2 years, who co-incidentally is also MtF, but thats a whole different post~

So anyway, over the majority of 2011, i have been living solely as ""Katy"", albeit only online, and around my closest friends IRL. Now the thing is, my confidence in who i am has rocketed so massively over this year, and i feel like i could tell my parents whenever i want, just i never do because i never know what to do, how to do it, what to say etc.

Basically i get overdosed on anxiety and chicken out each time, like today actually.

So...to get to the point. What i basically want as much help with as possible, is just knowing how on earth i go about this, and how to prepare myself, cause i am honestly more terrified about this than i am anything else, but i know if i do it, such a massive weight will be lifted from my shoulders, whether they like it or not, just because of the secret being out.

*copypasta*

I am a cis female but I have a friend that is at the beginning stages of her transformation.  I posted a thread a few weeks ago regarding some info and the response was warm, welcoming and amazing! This is a great community filled with beautiful people (I am usually just a lurker), and so I want to paint you - if anyone isn't afraid of showing off! 


I have body issues myself, though not with my gender. I am cataloging my weightloss and my body transformation, but there are only so many self-portraits I can do, and I can only lose weight so fast.  I love the human form and I find everyone's body to be beautiful (except mine...). I do not want to sound like a creep or be offensive- though asking anyone to get close to naked is pretty creepy, eh? I am very supportive of the LGBT community (as I have been my whole life) and looking at everyone's progress pics is inspiring and heartwarming. There are many beautiful pictures out there, and I would not want to use someone else's image without their permission.  **Seriously, I have to resist my urge to paint beautiful people when I see them, this subreddit doesn't make it easy on me!**

My goal through this art is to enlighten my community through images that show that being transgendered, androgynous, etc isn't weird, it's not a simple as being a ""boy in a dress"" or a ""girl that is just a tomboy"". It is not perverted. It is an extremely hard, long journey medically, socially, physically, financially. I am not doing this for shock value. I am open to paint what you are comfortable with showing- be it just your face, your clothed body, or even nude. (If you're wondering how I would paint you, if you could take a photo with good lighting and it isn't too blurry I can use it- I'm also looking to do a series so the more the merrier!).

**I mean no offense with this proposition and if I am rubbing you the wrong way, please let me know.**


Here is my portfolio:

(Check out the Oils section, as I would be focusing on large-scale oil paintings).

**My Process** 

* You can PM me or email me at kknadle.1@go.ccad.edu (legit school email so you know I'm not a creep!)
* I'm looking for well lit pictures, if you want my painting to look just like you, high quality is a plus! If you don't mind, I can work from blurry photos, just as long as they aren't tiny thumbnails!
* I will give you a model release form stating that I will not use your images for anything disgusting/rude/porn/etc and it also protects my copyright on the work
* I want you to give me pictures in which you are comfortable. If you want to flaunt a nude body, I'm all for it! If you just have a headshot, that is okay too!
* I was originally going to work on one painting at a time, but my prof urged us to start numerous ones so the sooner I could get refs, the better
* You let me know what you are comfortable with- if you don't want me posting the art online, I won't-
* If you have any questions, please ask me!

My group of friends has been shrinking, I've been struggling in school, and hormone therapy has eroded the emotional control I had just finished cultivating. I managed to smash my phone recently ($180 to replace) when I'm already bleeding money into hormones and laser and voice therapy and clothes and starting to run out. To top it all off, my relationship with my girlfriend ended horribly a few weeks ago - she hit me at a party and I immediately broke it off in front of 30 people.

Needless to say, I haven't been feeling fantastic about myself. 

So yesterday, my little brother brought some friends home, and I had the luck to walk into the kitchen while they were having a conversation about faggots and trannies and how gross it is to see two guys hold hands. Within a minute I was crying in my room; I must have been there in bed for four hours, crying and sleeping on and off.

When my mom got home that night, I tried to wipe the tears away and be happy and talk with her.. and I couldn't do it, I felt so awful. I ended up crying to her and telling her about how awful things have been lately. She hugged me and told me it would be alright and tried to make me feel better...

So today's Valentine's Day. I woke up and found this on my door.

2012-02-15 15:23:38,pqrjt,25,40,"At one point I considered myself lucky for being bigender. I read and agonized again and again over the pain experienced by other trans* individuals, trapped in a body and gender identity they didn't want. Sure, I've felt dysphoria at times. I even know deep down that if I had any choice on my genitalia I would choose female. But ultimately the male inside of me was glad to have his dick and his broad chest.

But the girl inside of me, the girl that has watched from the shadows bitterly as all the females around her grew into women, the girl who stares at her jawline and forehead in the mirror and can't help but think ""fuck"" is so exhausted of having to rip what little recognition she can out of the world around her. To 99% of the population I am just a misguided boy. To a certain segment of the LGBT population, I am a misguided girl or fag. But I don't want politics and ideas, I want love.

I found a boy who was also basically a girl with a dick. He was sweet and beautiful (as I am not) and great in bed. He let me crossdress and practice my voice and socialization patterns without judgment.

But I don't have a pussy. I'm not a ""real"" girl. Just an abstraction within the concrete form of a man.

I don't care a lot about Valentine's Day. Last night I ended up at his place and I wanted him inside of me so badly. The feeling is almost sacred; I genuinely feel sorry for all the people out there who don't know the pleasure of offering your body for penetration. I love him and though we don't date I wanted to show him just how much. We'd spent days wrapped in each other's arms and now I wanted that culmination I felt we were building toward.

This girl treats him so badly. She teases him with pussy to get him to get her stoned. She controls him and although she doesn't have any claim of exclusivity (or indeed anything near the intimacy I share with him) she demanded that on Valentine's Day he be faithful to her for the day. This is irritating in and of itself, but I was not in the mood to make him break his promise, because as absolutely stupid as it is, he sometimes needs to spend a day or two pretending he isn't a slut. But. I feel first, always. I was wounded, disappointed, angry with this bitch for controlling him and robbing me of the connection I craved. But it wasn't his fault. I held it in until I felt my heart start bleeding.

I told him I had come over there to get him to fuck me in the ass. His response was an agitated ""Zagarac, that's probably not going to happen. Definitely not today."" He went on about how he just really wasn't into it, and so wasn't that interested in doing it. He has done it before, has even begged me to do it for him. But suddenly he just didn't want to. And that's his right. But.

It was too fucking much. I stumbled home crying. I had never hated my body so much for being male. Inside I was just a devastated girl, disgusted by my body and heartbroken. When I give myself to men it is exclusively as the feminine self. The masculine self has no interest in men. But a feminine self does not a female form make.

He chose this bitch over me because she has a pussy. I love him, I feed him, I comfort him, I talk his problems out, I get him high, and I suck his cock so well he basically transcends thought. She manipulates him and hurts him for her own gain.

2012-02-16 14:49:38,psc5r,38,22,"Let's talk about those situations where something happens or someone says something that suddenly confirms you are passing.

I'll start with one today.

I'm waiting at a small train station and there's a man sitting at a bench a few meters away from me. I notice he looks at me for a fair bit, and I start getting a bit anxious.

He sat next to me when we got on the train (there were other seats available). I pull out my book (The Perennial Philosophy), then put it away as I was really tired and wasn't taking it in.

The guy next to me asks if I like philosophy, then proceeds to talk to me for the rest of the 90 minute train trip. He was talking all about being a muslim, telling me the rules on dating and marriage and explaining it starting with examples like ""Say if I wanted to marry you"".

I talk to him a bit about his religion, him speaking and me saying a sentence or two every so often. I ask a question at one point and he interrupts saying ""Your body is neither fat nor weak, I like it."" (The fuck?) He seems pretty heavy on the religion himself, and starts to talk about how 9/11 was organized by America/Jews. I'm kind of creeped out and not wanting to talk to him (he's a fair bit older than me) but whenever I look away he taps me on the shoulder. At one point he puts his hand on my leg. 

He then asks me to get a kebab with him, I don't respond. He talks more about Islam, then says we should get Coffee. I tell him I have a boyfriend (I actually have a girlfriend, no way I'm telling a muslim that), and he seems disappointed but says ""no no not like boyfriend or girlfriend"". He then advises me on muslim rules for boyfriends and girlfriends...

So despite it being a really weird train trip, I managed to experience my first major unwanted advance from a polite person who I couldn't really get away from. 

As much as it was a lame experience, at least I can say that a devout, proselytizing muslim man would NOT under any circumstance be hitting on a girl if they knew they were trans.

I keep hearing about people paying to or not being able to afford to change their name... which is silly cos you can do it for free! You don't need to change your passport until it expires either. Just use your old passport and an original copy of this deed poll.

**How does I change name?**

* Open this link https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TqMFpW45WnSenz-ehZgESi9tuAIt9y9vjnDDYCW5ovY/edit
* Search and replace New Name And Title and Old Name And Title with your new and old names,
* Print 4 (or so) copies,
* Ask two of your friends who aren't related to you, don't live with you, and have jobs to write their names, addresses, and professions in the lines at the bottom and then sign next to them,
* Sign your new and old signatures,
* Put a cheap red sticker on it,
* ?!??!,
* Profit!

Some people get all upset about some of these steps, and thats fair enough. Perhaps all of them aren't 100% necessary... but I'd rather have something thats legally the same as the ones you pay a lawyer to make. If you want to skip the sticker or have friends who are unemployed sign it then thats up to you : ).

Then came the metal detector, which was picking up an item of clothing I couldn't really remove, a underwire bra.  Now I realize this was a bad idea, but now I'm subjected to a pat down.  This is humiliating enough but, it gets worse.  First they call for a female agent to do the pat down, I guess I'm passing well enough for that.

Then finally a guy comes over and gives me the pat down, which I'm sure looked odd to the other people arround, a male aget patting down someone dressed as a women.

    Do you hear the song that flows across my mental plane,  
    The faintest tone of lifelong dreams that shall not be allayed?  
    Just how silent do they ring, so lovely but restrained?  
    Something far too modest, forever in refrain.  
 
    Were it but a concrete thing, an item to be held.  
    Too softly is it sung; too quickly is it quelled.  
 
    Since the words are lost like this, too weak and full of shame,  
    Shall I speak another way of hearts so poorly framed?  
    Of the image and the dream that leaves me to despair:  
    To cringe and make amends for falling short of one so fair?  

    There is a softness to her face, far beyond my means,  
    To dream, to hope, or replicate; all fall between the seams.  
    And who would grace me with this task of matching such grand heights?  
    Of all the things to emulate, would nothing else suffice?  
 
    Behold her lofty strength, an ideal more false than thought;  
    Should I attempt to become what I alone have wrought?  
    And what would my reflection bring when all is said and through?  
    Nothing but a self made face, so hideous and true.  
 
    No matter my instruction, I cannot seem to change.  
    Humans must be hollow, nothing internal to arrange.  
    Less our structure come to break fulfilling such a task,  
    Control remains restricted, no method to unmask.  
 
    And beyond her fair illusion, there is seldom much to find.  
    Only flesh and bone, beauty faded over time.  
    But it churns, that awkward thing, so perfect and unmatched.  
    Glory to the dreadful dream that others cannot grasp!  

    So step along that furthest edge, too far for just a glance,  
    And gaze with me in silence into this widest of expanse.

They are ""ok"", but to me the butt didn't look natural and the waist band was way up at the bottom of my ribs.  It was a thick/strong band that really dug in and made an obvious indentation.  also, the elastic fabric and pads they used made it sound like a muffled diaper. -lol- I never wore these in public.

However, I found a new site [Bubbles Bodywear](http://www.lovemybubbles.com/index.html). I had never heard of them but they have a very large selection and it looks like they design their own products.

The one the caught my eye was the ** [Bombshell Boyshort](http://www.lovemybubbles.com/padded-panty-hip-butt-lowrise.shtml#) **.  It has butt and hip pads.  

I ordered it on a Wednesday and received it on the next Friday -2 days-.  Unfortunately they sent the wrong size.  I emailed them to ask them the procedure and they were awesome.  They apologized and shipped the correct size on Saturday and I received them on the next Monday!  They also sent a prepaid package to send the other one back.  Anyway... I really like them!  

* The waist of the panty is below the waist of my jeans and shorts -AWESOME-.  This means I can wear some boardshorts for swimming and not be too self conscious about my hips -in theory-.

* The padding material + plus the fabric they used feels nice.  It does NOT have that diaper sound/feel.

* The padding material has stamped holes in them to help your skin breath.

* They TOTALLY hold a tuck in place!!

* They are VERY reasonably priced compared to others I have seen and bought.

The waist seems to fit perfect.  The legs are a little tight, but I've never worn boyshort panties, so not used to something wrapped around my thighs.

As you can see I'm quite excited about these padded panties!! I just wanted to share them with everyone in this community!

They have some products for trans men as well... such as a compression shirt that zips up like a vest! [here](http://www.lovemybubbles.com/mens-slimming-vest.shtml)

She is having a hard time &amp; constantly stresses over whether she is ever going to pass &amp; be accepted as female by society. She is obviously depressed &amp; angry over the cards she was dealt.

I have done my best to let her know that I love her for who she is &amp; that her gender and appearance are both completely irrelevant to me &amp; our friendship. I try to support her the best I can.

However, it's all she can talk about. For a long time now, 95% of the time we interact the conversation goes in the direction of her saying she will never be happy because she will never pass, will never get hired in her field because she is trans, requests for me to tell her she is pretty and will someday look like a biological woman, etc..

I understand depression and how it can consume you, and I wish she wasn't hurting, but it is really tiring and emotionally draining to have the exact same conversation twice a week or more, constantly for the past year.

I try to comfort her, tell her she is more beautiful than she realizes, that the people who matter will love her regardless (she has lots of friends and an amazing boyfriend), to try to focus on the positive aspects of her life. I don't know what else to say to her anymore. Maybe I'm saying the wrong things.

Half the time what I say just gets dismissed as impossible or unrealistic, the other half of the time I'm told I can't understand because I am not trans. 

I think it's unfair to me to have the same conversation with her over and over and over only to be told I can't understand when I try to be helpful. I feel like I only exist for her to vent at and my input is completely ignored unless I'm telling her she's pretty. I do understand how it feels to be alone in your own world of depression and obviously I'm not going to just abandon her because she's going through some shit.

This is really frustrating for me because I love her &amp; want to help her feel better but it's ruining our friendship. We almost never talk about anything other than her being trans anymore. I'm not longer a friend so much as an unqualified free therapist. She knows that this is alienating me as well as others but she just can't help it, every conversation either starts out with her daily worries about passing etc. or eventually turns in that direction. 

I really just don't know what to say her anymore. 

Any advice anyone has would be wonderful. I don't know if I'm going to come across as a selfish jerk here. I do feel like a horrible friend because I almost loathe talking to her anymore, but I love her and want to help her feel better about herself.

We almost never talk about anything other than her being trans anymore. I'm not longer a friend so much as an unqualified free therapist. She knows that this is alienating me as well as others but she just can't help it, every conversation either starts out with her daily worries about passing etc. or eventually turns in that direction. \n\nI really just don't know what to say her anymore. \n\nAny advice anyone has would be wonderful. I don't know if I'm going to come across as a selfish jerk here. I do feel like a horrible friend because I almost loathe talking to her anymore, but I love her and want to help her feel better about herself. I guess I don't know how to."", 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': 'Please help me salvage my relationship with my friend who is transitioning.', 'created': 1330491758.0}"

Even into my early 20's he would find ways to interfere with every single friendship I had. The negative long-term effects he's had on my life are countless.  
  
I pretty much stopped talking to him for around 5 years and recently he's been calling me and chatting. He's been very civil considering our past, so I decided I'd let him in on the fact that I am trans(mtf) via email. His response completely blew me away. He was extremely understanding and supportive. He's pretty much a different person than the one I grew up with. I cried while I read his email because I was so touched. For the first time in my life I can say that I'm glad he's my brother:)

2012-02-29 17:28:23,qbjly,13,56,"Hello everyone!
So a quick story that I thought I would share:
Last week I went to a local art show, I was standing by a photograph, admiring the work.  It was lovely.  After a few minutes of taking it all in a very beautiful girl came up to me, she was the artist who took the picture.  Her and I talked about it for a few minutes, she was bright, insightful, polite and all kinds of good people.  I could tell she was trans but extremely passable; we can usually smell our own.  So then a little boy came over, he must have been 7 or 8 years old, he was adorable and had the same facial features as the artist.  She introduced him as her son.  It turns out she was in a relationship years ago, had a child, transitioned and she is now his mother.  They had an amazing connection, she was affectionate, loving, attentive and there was no doubt she was his mother.  I think it is amazing and I'm a little envious, this is an opportunity that most girls like us do not get.  I hope she understands how fortunate she is.....
