I researched the topic a little, and decided that before investing in binding garments and such, I'd just experiment using a sports bra, an ace bandage and some duct tape. So I did, and put on my dapper-dyke mobster jacket, and looked at myself in the mirror.

2012-06-04 20:21:23,ukrxm,0,7,"Hey! I was featured in an article in Creative Loafing Tampa recently. It's in this week's issue (May 31 - June 06, 2012 - Vol.25 No.12). I'm on the freakin' cover, lol.

Here is a link to the article online: http://cltampa.com/gyrobase/from-matt-to-maddie-turner/Content?oid=2969908&amp;storyPage=2#.T80XCdUeN8F

There are a lot of things fundamentally wrong with the article, though. I was really excited about it coming out after the interview, but I was also nervous because I wasn't sure how it would read. Well, when I first read it, it actually depressed me. Lots of misgendering, some misquotes, etc. After really thinking about it (and tons of friends telling me how amazing it is), I've come to terms that it's a great opportunity to spread awareness to those who don't have any transgender frame of reference at all.

2012-06-11 02:38:35,uvio6,17,38,"Yesterday was one year on HRT. 

I know in the past I've made fancy HRT photo montages, but it's already later in the evening and I'm winding down for the day and I'm already a day late in posting this.

A year ago, Thursday, June 9th, I had two doctor's appointments. First was with a therapist, second was with an endocrinologist. I was hoping that the first would go well enough that I could give the second whatever she needed to approve treatment. That didn't work out quite as planned.

The therapist strung me along for 3 more months before closing his practice without ever giving me the letter he promised. He discounted his fee for me due to my employment situation, but provided no actual service. 

Turns out, I didn't need him anyway. I explained my situation to the endocrinologist, and she was all too willing to help. She was excited, actually. In her words, she ""hadn't done one of these in a while, not since the 80's"". She was enthusiastic to try out the new options available for hormones.

At the same time, my friend who you all know here as TroubleEntendre, was going through a much less rosy battle. We had a good-natured ""race"" to see who would get their prescription first. Turns out, she won her victory the same day. We both got our first dose of estradiol within around 2 hours of each other. I don't really remember who won anymore, I was just too happy for both of us. (I can't tell her story for her, but unfortunately, due to interruptions and access problems, we can't truly celebrate ""One Year"" together in the same way.)

In August I went full time. I met our school's LGBTQ Resource Center director for coffee and decided never to go back to the male life. I was done. I wasn't passing in any meaningful sense, but that was that. I went to my high school reunion as a woman, with support on all sides (the organizer was a speech pathologist who did her master's work in MTF voice therapy, so she was fully supportive).

In September, I started a new job and university within a week of one another. No one at either place had known the old me, except as a name in my mother's stories for those coworkers who knew her. At school, I joined the GSA, I became a SAFE Space trainer, I gave talks to classes. I even got elected mid-semester as a replacement for the club's vice president. At work, my security badge only let me into the women's locker rooms on day one, and my coworkers were enthusiastic about me using it (to an almost awkward degree, haha), and I started an ultimately unsuccessful process to remove the transgender exclusion from the insurance policy.

But in a sign of things to come, I had to drop one of my classes, bringing me down to part-time status. The time commitment was too much. 

Second semester was even more ambitious. In February, I finally had to quit my job because I couldn't keep up at school. I gave a speech at the MBLGTACC conference, and met a ton of amazing people. But the entire second semester was a struggle between stress, sanity, and school. Finally, with just weeks left to go, I dropped a couple of my classes down to audit status to avoid D's. 

This led to a severe depression spiral: by dropping the classes, that would mean fall semester I would meet none of the prerequisites for the fall classes, and it would be spring before I could retake the ones I didn't get B's or above in. So, that would be a year waiting; pushing my transition timeline out by another year. That would mean this past year hadn't gotten me any closer (time-wise) to being able to pay to finish what I'd started with the endocrinologist. That would mean pushing starting a family out even closer to 40.

HRT has also brought back old trauma that I no longer have the coping mechanisms to deal with. My old methods fail entirely in the face of the stronger, more vibrant emotions that have come with estrogen. Make no mistake, that vibrant emotional life and strong connection to others has been the *best* part of this. By far. But it has also brought with it unshakeable bouts of hopelessness due to financial stress.

Either:

A) I put off school again and work at a job that will likely take even longer to pay for transition (if it ever will)

or 

B) I keep going and hope that at the end of this I actually get a job that will pay enough to make the wait worth it.

I detest living in a place that makes access to medical care so difficult. I do, in fact, have sincere doubts about whether or not I would make it to the end of either of those scenarios. I always have; I had since before I started. But I also knew I had to try or else I'd look back at last year's realization that transition was possible and regret not starting sooner. Hell, I ALREADY regret that part for the years I did miss because when I was 6 years old and telling my parents, there was no one who would have helped me then. Help never existed for me.

On the flip side, I will say that not all is bleak. These thoughts that gnaw at me—because I am celebrating a tranniversary that (today) only serves to remind me of how far I have yet to go, and of the one person I lost along the way that I still wish was here with me—are not the only part of the story.

The other part is that most days I am happier. There's still a few too many unwelcome reminders that things are still ""in progress"", a few too many reminders that with proper access I'd be done already. But on the whole, things are good. 

Transition has opened doors for me, given me the opportunity to meet some amazing people, re-meet old friends-of-friends who used to be in the background of my life but are now my closest friends, and has given me the opportunity to help others like us every single day.

I am resolved to seeing the positive. I know my situation is neither the worst nor the best but somewhere on the good side of the middle.

Most importantly, I have reddit to thank. A picture reached the front page last year of someone's transition montage, and it opened the floodgates for me. Other events had set me up to be vulnerable in that moment, and seeing it was the last blow to the wall I had put up around the feelings. The wall was so old I forgot it was there and what was on the other side. 

I want to thank you all for being so supportive, and for the advice and information I've learned here. I've drifted away lately, in part due to the school stress, and in part due to the weariness from the battle between subreddits. 

But I'll never forget what you all gave.

**TL;DR:** Thanks for inspiring me. It's been an awesome year.

**And now the pictures!**
