I'm a 19 year old female, and I feel like I'm having a gender-identity crisis, which is pretty notable for me. For the majority of my life I have been largely uncaring of my gender. I dress androginously, usially in unisex T-shirts with cargo pants or jeans. In middle school I decided I was Bisexual, but gave up on it around the end of highschool, because... well...    ... anyway...

In the last year or so I've been having a harder and harder time being okay with being female. I handled menstruating pretty well for a long time, despite cramps that made me puke and mood swings that made me a monster. But now... now I want to be able to just not menstruate. I hate my uterus. I hate the discomfort and pain and I hate the insanity-inducing mood swings, and I just want it to stop.

In highschool my breasts were B's and later C's, and that was fine. It was okay, I liked them that way. In the last year though, they've grown beyond DD's, nearly every bra I can find hurts me for some reason or other. I've conidered breast-reduction surgery, but after reading up on it the concept of the process terrifies me. Since my breasts are so large, I can't not wear a bra without the weight pulling on my chest painfully, so I've survived with a few sports bras and a single D bra in a size up from what I should be, which barely fits at all but is better than nothing.

I just... I needed someone to bring that all out to.

I have other, more personal/NSFW reasons for my gender identity crisis, but I don't want to share them right away, just in case that would be TMI for some people.

The questions that I have for whoever will answer are these:

1. What do you think of my overall situation, and do you want to know more?

2. Are there different ""levels"" of transgender-ism? are some people more or less transgender than others? Is it possible to be transgender to androgynous(having no gender)?

3. Are there ""right"" and ""wrong"" reasons for being transgender?

I'm a 19 year old female, and I feel like I'm having a gender-identity crisis, which is pretty notable for me. For the majority of my life I have been largely uncaring of my gender. I dress androginously, usially in unisex T-shirts with cargo pants or jeans. In middle school I decided I was Bisexual, but gave up on it around the end of highschool, because... well... ... anyway...

In the last year or so I've been having a harder and harder time being okay with being female. I handled menstruating pretty well for a long time, despite cramps that made me puke and mood swings that made me a monster. But now... now I want to be able to just not menstruate. I hate my uterus. I hate the discomfort and pain and I hate the insanity-inducing mood swings, and I just want it to stop.

In highschool my breasts were B's and later C's, and that was fine. It was okay, I liked them that way. In the last year though, they've grown beyond DD's, nearly every bra I can find hurts me for some reason or other. I've conidered breast-reduction surgery, but after reading up on it the concept of the process terrifies me. Since my breasts are so large, I can't not wear a bra without the weight pulling on my chest painfully, so I've survived with a few sports bras and a single D bra in a size up from what I should be, which barely fits at all but is better than nothing.

I just... I needed someone to bring that all out to.

I have other, more personal/NSFW reasons for my gender identity crisis, but I don't want to share them right away, just in case that would be TMI for some people.

The questions that I have for whoever will answer are these:

1. What do you think of my overall situation, and do you want to know more?

2. Are there different ""levels"" of transgender-ism? are some people more or less transgender than others? Is it possible to be transgender to androgynous(having no gender)?

3. Are there ""right"" and ""wrong"" reasons for being transgender?

However, as hard as it is any other year to receive the stereotypical ugly shirt, oversized clothes, etc.. But now that I'm out as a transwoman to my wife, I'd have hoped that some of it would die down a bit.

But this year, the selections seem extra obnoxious.  Almost as if she tried 'extra hard' to pick things that are 'manly'.  Lots of boxer shorts (which I have never liked, and she knows it), sports-themed PJs, anything she could find extra baggy in black was under the tree.

I know I shouldn't care what I receive - but frankly, it would be better to get nothing than to try to pretend to be happy with this stuff.

Hardest Christmas yet... and here I thought it gets easier when you finally come out and start the transition process.... :(

At least the kids spread enough joy for everyone, which makes me smile regardless.

Merry Christmas.. sorry for venting!

2012-12-25 18:32:32,15fgem,4,3,"I was at work this day last year, rolling around the store in an office chair, while co-workers rang customers up. I was the management on duty for the day, and I did my rolly chair duties well. I gave my co-workers time in the chair too, as all must enjoy the bliss of rolling around a store like crazies for customers to see.

A year before that: I was sad! Uncontrollably sad! I was not working at all. I was alone with my thoughts, and I dreamed good dreams of the future, of friends I'd make and new loves I'd find.

2009: I was alone yet again. I dreamed good dreams of the future. I dreamt of the future and the life I'd live, and they comforted me.

2008: I was lonely yet again, but high school was over, and I was picking up what remained of my sanity after those four years of hell. I cursed my life. My inability to transition crippled me, and I saw no future. I saw nothing. I saw my death and all who had tortured me in school cracking one more joke at my expense. I looked at the reflection in the polished glass and I was not there, but a stranger who kept me going for reasons I still cannot fathom. Why did that man in the mirror not lay down and die?

2007: I was at my worst. I had stopped attending classes at high school, and I was an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital. Horrible things had been done to me for the three years prior to Christmas Day 2007, and I wanted to die, but society said no, that my day had not yet come, that I was too young to die so horribly and so lowly.

And today, we flash forward again, and it's Christmas Day 2012. I made it 5 years from high school to today. And I feel more whole than I have for as long as I can remember. I'm on estrogen and spironolactone, and I've made so many friends! Friends who have stuck by me through the hard times, and friends who touched my heart in ways too profound to speak of, and I wonder, I wonder: What will the next five years bring to me? I've finally started transitioning! I will have been on HRT for three months in but a few days, and I can actually see myself as I will be in five years, and by God, it's reassuring to be able to have that. I can see a life worth living now.

And so it was. Things did get better. I have many problems still, but my life is improving, and I choke back tears at what I've lost for today is not the day to shed those tears. Today is the day to celebrate how far we've all come. Have you started transitioning yet? Have you made new friends? Did you find a job? Did you reconcile with somebody you loved and lost? Celebrate being alive today. This is the season where it's typically cold outside, and so we huddle together for warmth around a fire, so talk about stuff here! Talk about your triumphs! Talk about what gets you down, what makes today not so great for you. Make friends.

I'd sure love to make a new friend on Christmas, personally, it would be a blessing and a great gift. :P",transgender,And so it was,1356485552.0,"{'created_utc': 1356460352, 'id': '15fgem', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""I was at work this day last year, rolling around the store in an office chair, while co-workers rang customers up.

So today is my 26-th birthday. Yay! And it's around a year since I came out to myself. And it has been one frustrating, hard, and a bit sucky year. At the  same time it has passed quickly - quicker than I thought, and there have been some positive events, but some negative as well, and...well one year has passed...365 days of precious time...most of which I've wasted.I regret not training my voice enough, or not doing other things, but it's nothing that I can do now...I regret for not talking to people, and for many other things...
You see... one year ago I thought by this time I'll be in the Netherlands doing my ph.d. and being on HRT for some months, transitioning happily. But, as usual, life has its own plans - I'm still stuck here in my post-socialist eastern-european country. Sure, I'll be moving to Denmark in January, but it seems that wouldn't help much...Anyhow, after years of wishing that I'd wake up as a girl, and even something as a ""vision"" that it will happen someday, I'm stuck here trying to make the best of my life...And... the magic just does not happen, you just not transform over night. I've finally come to terms with this, and I'm terrified of the future. I am scared... Yet I so much want to wake up as a girl, to be one, that its beyond my capabilities to describe. And I know I'll do the best I can. I know sometimes my strength doesn't seem enough... and yet, its not like  I have much of a choice...I hate myself for not figuring out this a few years ago, but I'm willing to make the best that I can from what I have. I know very few of my friends and family will support me, even people, that I've previously counted on. 
I know transition is my way, even if I have to put some close people behind me...Because time is running away, and the sooner you act  the better. I know there's a big scary adventure in front of me with uncertain end, but there is nothing I can do, but dive into it.I do not know what the future holds, and I'm scared as fuck...
