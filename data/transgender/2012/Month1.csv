I've translated the video below, but even if you don't understand Cantonese, the video is essentially a full minute of stalker-cam (video of her walking through a mall, video of her leaving work etc.)

*Translation of the video*

""Waiting for a sex change, a male cop goes to work and leaves work in a mini skirt.""

Ah Yun, who has been in the police force for nearly ten years, is Ngau Tau Kok Police Station's celebrity. His original name was Ah Fan, and the long-haired Ah Yun usually likes to wear short skirts - more feminine than most women. But, in uniform and on the job, he is indistinguishable from his male colleagues. The only difference is that he doesn't wear a hat, instead wearing a ponytail. He's already undergone six years of psychological evaluation, and plans to undergo sexual reassignment surgery in the middle of the year so that he can properly be a female police officer. 

According to sources, Ah Yun once had a girlfriend and even has a son, but refuses to say why he wants to undergo SRS. 

(phone interview with a professor of psychology from Chinese University of Hong Kong)

""This [transsexuality] is rarely caused by trauma, work related stress or family problems. Rather, we believe that this is something people are born with.""

The police force treats Ah Yun differently, with a changing room specifically for him, and exempting him from doing patdowns of male or female suspects. Usually, he drives patrol cars and is on traffic duty. Although many of his colleagues are accepting, there are still people who don't accept it. ""Male officers can't see him as a man, female officers can't see him as a woman either.""

After his shift, he walks rapidly, possibly to avoid other's stares. 

(more from the professor)

""Actually, if these individuals can express themselves, there is nothing about their mental state that is different from you or I.""

Hong Kong has five or six transgendered police officers, but for reasons of privacy the police force refuses to comment. Transgender resource centers say that transgendered individuals often suffer from discrimination at work; just the single phrase ""tranny"" causes a lot of harm. Hopefully people will slowly accept them.

Heres the story. 

I live my girlfriend and her sister in an apartment in boston, ma. We've been here since july of last year. I came out in sept of last year as trans. At first everything was fine, gf was fine, sister was fine, everything is cool.

In the last few months the sister as become aggresive toward me and my gf(her sister) mostly because I had to pull her off my girlfriend when she was physically choaking her (I know a lot of people over react to things on askreddit so please please understand that this comes from as rational a place as possible) Now I did physically restrain her (Held her, I'm a trained martial artist) But I did not hit her, she hit me though many times.

That was a couple months back, now she has gotten her mother who also very much dislikes me because she couldn't understand why I defended my girlfriend and didn't let them ""fight it out"". So now the mother has threated to get the brother to come down here an Phyiscally evict me.

Ok now the important stuff.

I am not on the lease(trust me, I know. Really, I tried.)

My Gf who sides with me, and her sister are the ones signing the lease

The mother is the co-signer. She will not, and can not stop paying for the appartment without a huge hit to her credit, and I don't think she can legally do it anyway.

My options are this:

Do the cosigners have any power over who lives here?

Does one tenant have a right to kick someone out even if the other tenant disagrees?

Does the fact that I have no where to go and they would be kicking me out on the street have any relevance?

Does the fact that I'm trans  and a lot of the reason the mother and the sister want me out is because they think i""m sick and perverted, mean that i'm protected under mass law?

Please help me. I don't know what to do. My GF is willing to stand up to her family but I don't know if thats going to help or not.

2012-01-04 16:25:13,o2mjk,44,20,"Dear #########

I was wondering what to do. I live across the street from a serial predator of transsexuals. 

She owns a boutique/b&amp;b/trans makeover salon that she runs out of her house. She appears to use it to lure us in. The typical MO is after a period of coddling, the tgirls that appear vulnerable enough to her are singled out in more intimate settings, wherein she starts dropping hints about what a great thing it would be to have the victim as a ""BDSM play partner."" Usually it's those of us in very early stages of our transition, already at a life's low in the self-esteem department, especially prone to accept intimacy and validation from anyone, no matter how abusive. She uses these means to get us to ""volunteer"" to be her ""subs,"" and then the real fun begins. We are beaten in ""play parties,"" which are often nothing more than battery sessions in her own house wherein few or none of the usual BDSM safety standards are followed, including the biggie regarding consentuality. We are then isolated from what few friends early transition has left us with, as she uses deceit and physical isolation to separate them from us, as she again uses goods and services from her shop, and for some of us drugs, to run us into debt and make us more financially dependent on her. We are treated like human garbage, humiliated in public and at events, and used for all the labor that she needs to run her ""business"", all unpaid of course. She's becoming known in the BDSM community as an abusive domme. I don't let my son go over to play with her grandson she always cares for because she's always on speed-laced marijuana.

Those of us lucky enough to have the strength remaining, after all this, to cast off our collars and try to live our lives independently, are shunned and disparaged by her and all those she controls. I for instance am having my abilities as a single mother brought into question and my landlord's had conversations with her where she tried to get him to deny my lease renewal so her ""subs,"" slaves in too many real ways, can move in here conveniently right across the street. My son and my home are very important to me, so this is why I felt I had to speak out, notwithstanding the fear I have for the next tgirl that is led into that dark place. One of my best friends just uncollared from her, thankfully before the suicidal ideation she was having took hold.

But don't take my word for it. There is nothing I've said that can't be backed. I wish, sincerely, that this was just sour grapes, and not fear for my community driving my speaking out. Believe me, I'm into the BDSM stuff, and I'm no prude when it comes to drugs either. But I see this as over the line.

  There are at least three other tgirls I know of that have, with varying degrees of success, cast off her collar, both physically and emotionally. If you'd like I could ask them if they'd like to talk to you. She could be doing a simple, nice thing for the community, but she's twisted it into something evil. I'm not gonna shut up about this. I refuse to stay silent.

Yes, I know. ""What? Final Fantasy XI and XIV? Didn't they flop?"" Yes and no. Final Fantasy XI actually was a critical success when it came to MMO's at the time of its release, averaging around 500k active players and 1 million active characters on its Peak. This was no small feat at the time, and for a while It was even king of the hill. Of course eventually WoW came around and took that spot, and eventually the playerbase of XI declined. 


But I still loved it. I played Final Fantasy XI for almost 9 years. Eventually quitting to transfer my attention to Final Fantasy XIV. But when they announced Final Fantasy XIV I felt like something was wrong, something that was missing, and they had had a chance to fix it way before they even released the game. 


You see in Final Fantasy XI there were two races which were considered ""Gender Exclusive."" Mithra which were the agile dexterous Feline Female Only race, and Galka which were the Strong Virtuous Meat Shield buff dude male only race. Back when I started playing XI, I had no real problem with this, At the time I was still experimenting with my own gender issues and trying to overcompensate in real life, but in XI I played a Mithra. And it made me happy. 


But Times change, and even though I'm transitioning to live as a Woman. I have changed in my perspective of what I find attractive in the female characters I play. Starting to prefer muscular, amazonian women. 


And that is the problem I had with Final Fantasy XIV, It didn't have any. You see when they decided which races to include in their new game, they decided to take the races from XI and alter them slightly and change their names. But the same Gender Exclusiveness for the Miqo'te (Mithra) and Roegadyn (Galka) remained. They Even added a Third Gender Locked race of supermuscular Male Humans called Highlanders. 


With Miqo'te losing their ferocity, and Elezen (Elvaan) losing their muscles. Not to mention Roegadyn and Highlanders not having a female Counterpart, there was no muscular imposing brutish female for me to play. I felt, and still feel left out. 


So I complained. From the moment they announced that genders would be locked for the Miqo'te, Roegadyn, and Highlander Hyur (Humans). My sole goal being, a Muscular, Female character I could play and enjoy. That I could feel comfortable playing and call my own. 


I started a petition on the Eorzeapedia (Final Fantasy XIV Fan Wiki hosted by the same guys who operate the largest XI wiki FFXIclopedia, Now both operating under the Gamer Escape group.) And when Square Enix finally created a Private Player Forum, I started one there. [It was my first post the day the forum opened.] (http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/891-Missing-Genders-A-request-for-Male-Miqote-Female-Highlander-and-Female-Roegadyn) I've since updated the first post to reflect the Posts from the Square Enix Staff Members showing the results of my thread, my petition. 


Female Roegadyn, Male Miqo'te, and Female Hyur Highlanders will become playable. 


The moment I saw the first confirmation of it back in April, I started crying. I was so happy. Then came the waiting game. They announced first they would release them as NPC's here and there and then with a major update later they would indeed become playable. And even offer free character gender changes to those that want them!


How epic. 


Then the First Female Roegadyn showed up in the story line. [Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn] (http://i.imgur.com/qC1lr.jpg) Oh I was blown away yet again. She exuded what I wanted. Ferocity, Honor, Strength, Nobility. She even was the leader of the city I had aligned and pledged myself to. She was the Head Admiral of the Limsa Lominsa City State. I absolutely fell in love.


But yet again the waiting game is present. But this year, coinciding with the 2.0 Version Release of Final Fantasy XIV which includes an entire graphic engine update to a whole new engine, and a complete overhaul of lots of key systems, Those missing genders will all become playable for the first time.  [Even the Male Miqo'te has shown up in pictures] (http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/attachment.php?attachmentid=151&amp;d=1325674276) And I must say hes pretty cute too. 


So yeah, That is my story. I know it probably isn't all that relevant to Transgender Issues, but for me, I still count it as a major victory for Gender Equality with Square Enix and Final Fantasy XIV.

-----

I cut my hair, a few months ago. I asked about how short hair would look on Facebook, but in the end I knew I was going to do it anyways. I'd never been allowed to cut my hair when I was younger; my mother was an exceedingly vain person who always wished for me to wear dresses and use makeup. However, it was something I'd wanted to do for years, and I finally did it. When I posted the pictures on Facebook, I decided something.

I was done lying.

I was done avoiding the subject when people asked why I wore baggy clothes, or why I didn't dress a little girlier--you're thin and cute, what the hell else could you ask for? Take advantage of it!

Hah. Right.

Of course, Facebook doesn't allow for an ""other"" option, so I changed my gender to male--the one I felt was closer to my actual gender. I prepared for the worst, but nothing could've readied me for the months to come.

I look at myself in the mirror, nowadays, and for the first time, I smile. My first memory, in fact, was looking at myself and thinking, ""That can't be me."" I hated myself, but now, I look at myself and I just think--I'm doing it.

My friends aren't just okay--they're openly supportive. They ask me, ""What would *you* prefer us call you?""

And believe me, when you've only been recognized as female, you get one hell of a tingle when you're at KFC, and they say, ""He wanted two biscuits with his meal."" It's like a whole side of you people ignored is suddenly being accepted into the world, and this weight you felt your entire life is just disappearing.

Think I'm gonna go cry.

I Came out to my Co-workers and my HR Rep. 

They were all super excited and supportive. Every single one of them gasped when I mentioned that I almost committed suicide. But all of them perked up when I finally said ""I've been having trouble dealing with my gender identity, And after talking to therapists and doing soul searching, I've decided to transition from being a male to being a woman."" 

I think the weirdest part of it all was how excited my HR Rep got.

She even wants to throw a party when I go full time.. 0.o weird. 

Anyway She wants to know if there is anything she can do to help, and can't wait for me to get her my name/gender change papers etc. 


That leaves me at approximately 90% out. The Only People left are my Father, My Stepmom, and the few friends I haven't come out too because I haven't seen or talked to them in forever. 

I plan to be with one of my girlfriends Sunday at my dads for lunch. I will be coming out to him and my step mom then.

Then I'll do a blanket Facebook update to everyone else on my boy mode facebook. At that point everyone will know.

Update: I went to my Dad's house with the explicit idea of coming out to him tonight. When I got there, he wasn't available.

I came out to my Father, I guess I don't feel like calling him Dad anymore. And I guess that in itself already tells you how it went. 

He didn't get violent, he didn't yell, he didn't do anything. He just stood there and was quiet for the longest time. And when I finally stopped babbling and sat there unable to look him in the eye, he finally spoke. 

He told me I was confused, that I was letting a moralless society drive me down a forsaken path. That I was listening to evil council, That I had no right to do what I was doing. How was it fair for me to do this when men their whole lives just lived with those thoughts. Hah, Lived with them. I guess he didn't understand the part about how I had a gun in my mouth when I was just ""Living"" with those thoughts. 

He tried to negate all the positive changes that have gone on in my life, and in the end the last thing he said to me was ""I don't think I can be comfortable with this. I don't know how this will affect our relationship."" I told him I didn't know either, but that was up to him, as I was not going to remove him from my life unless that is what he wanted. I got up and headed towards the door. He asked me if I was leaving I said yes, and he never responded. 

He didn't say goodbye, He didn't try and stop me from leaving, He didn't do anything. 

Afterwards when I got back to my office, [I updated my male facebook] (http://www.facebook.com/midgardzolom/posts/313255945385420) and then sent friend invites to the few friends on my male facebook who were not on my female one.

In all, it feels great, I no longer have a weight on my shoulders, I'm not hiding anymore. 

I never planned to go stealth, I never planned to be anything but who I am. I'm proud of who I am, of my transgender self, and my lifestyle. So I have no intentions of hiding it.

I don\'t know how this will affect our relationship."" I told him I didn\'t know either, but that was up to him, as I was not going to remove him from my life unless that is what he wanted. I got up and headed towards the door. He asked me if I was leaving I said yes, and he never responded. \n\nHe didn\'t say goodbye, He didn\'t try and stop me from leaving, He didn\'t do anything. \n\nAfterwards when I got back to my office, [I updated my male facebook] (http://www.facebook.com/midgardzolom/posts/313255945385420) and then sent friend invites to the few friends on my male facebook who were not on my female one.\n\nIn all, it feels great, I no longer have a weight on my shoulders, I\'m not hiding anymore. \n\nI never planned to go stealth, I never planned to be anything but who I am. I\'m proud of who I am, of my transgender self, and my lifestyle. So I have no intentions of hiding it. \n\nGood Night Reddit.\nI love you, And thank you for all the support you guys and everyone in the internet Transgender Communities has given me.

I'm 18 and I have never really been in a relationship with a guy before, as female ( I have dated pre transition as male before though). 

I have met someone online and he seems absolutely amazing so far, but I do notice I get unrelentingly paranoid.
How do I know that he likes me for me?  He is really cool about androgyny and gender. He seems intelligent. I just don't know if I should be taking super duper extra precautions or what. Does this horrible feeling subside?

Anyways, I hope that wasn't confusing. ANY tips would be helpful.
I figured this belonged here, and not relationships or some other subreddit.

The approach I have in mind is portraits accompanied by text where the subject can explain what makes them who they are. I will probably be personally shooting in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York. I would like to include everyone who wants to participate in the project, even if they are unable to photographed by me.

I'd love to hear any input, and would be very gracious to anyone in Baltimore/Philly/NYC area that would sit for a portrait. You'd of course maintain the rights to your photographs and get a copy. I don't intend to publish, but if its good enough it might be a good thing to put out there for the world. So we'd have to talk release forms. 

Nothing is set in stone (can this even be done in 4 months?) let's talk details.

2012-01-15 00:28:17,ohdmk,25,28,"So, Last Sunday, I came out to my step-mom. When I talked to her in person she seemed ok about it, was even laughing and joking with me about things. I seriously thought she was Ok with everything. 

Monday, she called me pretty much begging me to come Monday night so I could finally come out to my Father. I said I would, Took a break off work because I work the night shift and came to their house. A place I used to live, and no longer do. I came out to him, and he didn't take it too well. As a bit of a way to just get it over with, when I got back to work, I posted a public outting of myself on my male facebook, shared it by my female facebook, then commented to it on my female facebook to anyone that commented on it. 


Friday came around and I hadn't heard from my Father. He didn't even send me an email. He hadn't posted anything to facebook (Something he uses for work to advertise stuff) and when I talked to my sister, who also works for him and knows I'm trans, he hadn't been into the office. 

I got concerned, I was really concerned about him. So I sent my step-mom a text message asking how he was dealing. 

This is what I got back from her. 

&gt;*Jeffrey, you cannot expect your dad to support your lifestyle. I hope you can step outside yourself for a minute &amp; see how this is affecting your family. You want them to be open to your decision but you are not being open to their concerns. We all care deeply for you. I urge you to take the time to fully consider if this is the path you want to take.*

Thanks for using my Male name... I never asked for my Fathers support, I told him that I didn't care about if he could accept it or not. I was his child and still wanted to be, I just couldn't be his son anymore. Beyond that, I sit and wonder how much more time could I possibly take to fully consider this decision? I'm 25, I'd have my first gender non-conforming outbursts apparently when I was 2 years old, based on my Mothers recollection. She even tried to convince my Father I had issues and that I needed help THEN. God I'd be so happy if they had, but they didn't. And the few shrinks I did see for my ADD, I had already been scared by them both into not talking about wearing womens clothing or anything gender non-conforming.

Anyway, I replied to her with the following. 


&gt;*Kiran, I know it seems like I just dropped this on the family, but the truth is, I didn't. I've had these thoughts since I was 4 or 5. My mom even told me about things I was doing before that that made her question if I had a problem, but when she tried to tell dad he insisted there was nothing wrong with me. I am sorry this is hard for both of you to understand, And I really want you both in my life. I know I'm excentric. That's who I am. I'm not doing this for revenge or to upset you guys. I'm doing it because I tried for 25 years to play the first born son, only to come home and cry about it. I played football and baseball because dad forced me, I wasn't into it, that's why I never excelled at any male sports. I had a choice last June to either kill myself or this, I chose this because I couldn't see myself living as a guy anymore. I know that's even more upsetting, but it is the truth. I had the barrel of my rifle in my mouth, it was chance that my Friend called me interupting me and talking me down... I love you both, but my sanity, and my ability to live happily are more important. I can live happy this way, I already do, the smile I show the world now is real, not some mask I force myself to wear. I'm sorry I've been a horrible child. But this is what saved me and I'm embracing it full force. Goodbye, I hope you guys can figure out how to deal with it. Maxine.*


Yeah, I totally carpet bombed that last Name in there. Felt good. She so far hasn't replied. I guess that is for the best.

I just wish they had both been more supporting. My Birth Mother took it much better. 
Sadly now my sisters also giving me issues about it. I'm afraid I'm going to lose that side of the family completely. 


It will just make it easier when I have the money to move to Portland I guess. Fuck this town.

2012-01-15 06:00:19,ohpj8,9,28,"So I am about to start estrogen already on spiro and back at thanksgiving after my brother and sister-in-law found out (both way cool) my mom said that she wanted to have some family pictures made before so that she could remember guy me, plus we havent had family pictures since i was a kid. I know the thought of this would make a lot of trans people cringe but i immediatley said ""yeah and then next year we can do it again! (i go full time in may)."" 

Well today we did the guy me pictures. We did the whole dark jeans white shirt thing and since we live in texas it was nice enough to do them outside. In every shot the photographer would make me try to sit or stand a bit more masculinly because in guy mode i look a little more masculine than my brother as i am bald and a bit taller. I would wiggle back eventually and we would find a middle ground. It got really bad when we were doing pictures of just me and my brother then by myself. When she was working with just me my mom could see that i was struggling and yelled

""Think about yourself a year from now!""

This actually made me smile and almost cry. Of course my family knew what this was a reference to and all gave me encouragement. Later today i asked my mom about it and she said that she saw i was having trouble and said 

""And next year we will do it again and it will be better""

I'm so happy now! She has a big front window in her house, on one side will be all the pics from this year and the other side will be next years, she was explaining this all to me with a lot of excitement. I asked if next year we would use the same photographer to which i got a maybe and i responded

I know the thought of this would make a lot of trans people cringe but i immediatley said ""yeah and then next year we can do it again!

In every shot the photographer would make me try to sit or stand a bit more masculinly because in guy mode i look a little more masculine than my brother as i am bald and a bit taller. I would wiggle back eventually and we would find a middle ground. It got really bad when we were doing pictures of just me and my brother then by myself. When she was working with just me my mom could see that i was struggling and yelled\n\n""Think about yourself a year from now!""\n\nThis actually made me smile and almost cry.

Now, she knows I'm a transman.  She claims she's a big ally of the entire LGBTQILMNOP community, so when we first started working for her I felt comfortable telling her.  Turns out she was doing a term paper for her graduate psych class on LGBT youth or something like that, and decided she wanted me and Partner to be her main interviewed subjects.  Now, she knows my story (I came out to a very unreceptive audience and have generally had a rough time with being out), but in this interview she decided to make me relive every single moment of my trans-life.  All those things you hate to be asked?  She asked them.  ""What was your old name?""  ""Have you had any surgeries?""  ""Have you been assaulted?""  ""Are your relatives okay with your choice to transition?""  You know, all those old cans of worms you spend so long trying to suppress.

Along with that glaring example of shenanigans, there's also a bunch of just little remarks that she makes that just stab right through me.  Here's just a few examples.

* The other day the 3 of us went to the store the other day.  We went by the feminine products aisle, and Boss asked ""Do we need to get any of this stuff?""  Partner said ""No, I'm good"" and left it at that (she keeps up with that kind of stuff for the two of us).  Boss went on to ask ""How about you, Phil?  Do you need anything?"" in front of at least 4 or 5 other people on that particular aisle.  I was so taken aback I couldn't even reply.  
* One of those commercials for testosterone supplements aimed at middle aged men came on the TV.  I joked to Partner ""That's my problem, low testosterone!  Get me the phone, I'll order some.""  Boss decides to pipe up ""You know they won't sell any to people like you, right?""  Oh shit, really?  Well golly gee, I didn't figure, thanks for saving me from a ton of embarrassment!
* A while back I was feeling very ill so I decided not to wear my binder around the house (cause a binder plus a respiratory infection equals pain).  I hadn't left mine and Partern's room all day cause she'd been taking care of me, but I was after a glass of water.  So I decide to scuttle to the kitchen to grab it and run right back.  I had on 2 shirts and a black hoodie, so it's not like errything was out and about.  Boss sees me and decides to exclaim loudly ""Phil!  Look at that, you're not wearing your binder!"" then proceeded to ask me a dozen questions about it, ignoring my very obvious discomfort.
* She also likes to give me tips on how to pass.  Now, I pass pretty well.  I'd put it at maybe 90% success rate (#winning).  And yet she always has a little protip about passing.  ""If you get a hair cut, you'll probably look more masculine.""  ""Maybe you should put on another baggy shirt today.""  ""You look like you've gained some weight, maybe you should lose it to look more masculine.""

I dunno, maybe I'm just overreacting and real sensitive about the whole thing, but it's driven me to the point of madness.  It just seems like the whole transgender thing is so prevalent in her eyes.  I'm not a man, I'm a TRANSman, and she won't seem to let me forget it.  Do y'all think I'm overreacting about this whole thing?  And how can I politely bring up the fact that she's pissing me off and makin an ass out of herself without being rude about it?

**Edit for ze updates:** Well, we had a nice chat about it.  She didn't seem to understand before (or after) our conversation that what she was saying was pretty much stupid and making me grossly uncomfortable.  It seems that she believes that since she claims to be bisexual (I am skeptical), she's automatically a savant in the area of all things LGBT.  She's still being pretty ignorant at the speed of light (honest to God asked Partner if the sex was okay since I don't have manly bits [spoiler alert: I do, they just come with a harness]).  I think this is gonna be an ongoing project here.  But a huge thanks for all your advice, y'all!

Just a note about this:

I was always interested in how people's birth-assigned, gender presentation unfolded throughout their transition: It seemed as if people's initially gender presentations just instantly died off at the time of their transition (Which may be the case with some people). As I had not seen any like that, save maybe one or two; I thought I should start with myself (As I had just hit the 4 month mark) and see if it catches on for future timelines. I may just be being a bit vain, but I had a thought that it would be a bit more inspirational to other people to show how the other aspect to transitioning changes. 

All thoughts, comments, questions, and critiques are welcome.

2012-01-21 01:05:36,opmo9,25,42,"So, since it's still self post only right now, and I have nothing of value to contribute even if it wasn't, I thought I'd tell a story!  This is about my first day outside my apartment, not wearing boy drag.

Actually, that's a little disingenuous.  The first time was in June, during Denver's Pridefest, but I don't really feel like that counts as it wasn't as big of an emotional risk for me.  This is about the second time, which was just for a lunch date with my friend, Jordan.

So I was terrified, of course.  I don't really consider myself [the prettiest of girls](http://imgur.com/a/3Rko8), and my fashion sense and makeup skill are lacking at best, so I was worried sick about not passing and being mocked or attacked or whatever.  But it was important for me to do it, and since I had Jordan's company, I wanted to take advantage of that and not waste it on another day looking like a boy.

Anyway, this was before I started hormones and about three sessions into having my facial hair lasered off.  I wore that green shirt you can see in the pictures (Weedmaster P's cookware shirt ;D) and a cute brown tiered skirt that came down to about mid-calf.  I thought I looked AWFUL.  I could still see the shadow of my facial hair under heavy makeup, my hair was a frizzy wreck, and I just felt gross.  But I went to pick Jordan up anyway, and we went to the very awesome Tres Jolie in downtown Littleton.

And... no one really commented on my appearance.  I didn't get gendered at all, but... I wasn't MISgendered, and I wasn't gawked at.  So about halfway into lunch, I finally relaxed a little.  I mean, I was wolfing down my mushroom sandwich and lavender soda in a VERY unladylike fashion, and still no one cared.

After that, we met a couple of Jordan's friends at the mall, where she bought a top for a trip to the club they'd planned and I bought an awesome grey shirt with ""Smart Chicks Rule"" on it.  I didn't actually try it on, but I wanted to force myself into more interactions with strangers, to test to see how people were reacting to me, and the cashier was nothing but sweet.

But then I found I had to go to the bathroom... since I'd only ever gone into the men's room, this was completely terrifying, but, again, I HAD to do it.  I didn't give myself a choice.  So in I went, and... again, no one cared.  The people sitting outside the door gave me a sidelong glance, and I got the same from a woman inside who was with her children, but nothing serious.

Afterwards, I was in the stall, struggling with my clothes.  I use a gaff, and it was giving me trouble, but eventually I got it under control, washed my hands, and left with no more trouble.  When I walked out, the people outside laughed a little, but I assumed it was nothing.

But... it wasn't.  Jordan and I were walking around window shopping, when a woman came up behind me and said, ""sweetie, you need to fix your skirt.""  Panicked, I reached behind me, and... THE BACK OF THE BOTTOM OF MY SKIRT WAS TUCKED INTO MY PANTIES.  I INSTANTLY turned bright red, hurriedly fixed it and thanked the woman, and marched straight into the nearest shop to hide.

I felt like I was going to cry, but I breathed, tried to calm down, and looked around to see where I was... the Guess store.  Normally way outside of my price range, but I figured it would help distract me, so I started looking at skinny jeans.  Surprisingly, I found a really, REALLY cute pair in a size that looked like it would fit me, and when an employee asked if I wanted to try them on, I said yes.  And oh my gosh, did my ass look fantastic in those jeans.  They were $100, but... I had a little spare money, so I reasoned that since I was so proud of myself for successfully dealing with that day, I deserved something nice and expensive, especially if it made me look nice.  And then we went home!

In retrospect, it was one of the best experiences of my life, because I learned three really important things: 1) That old saying is true: people are way too busy paying attention to themselves to ever notice you; 2) I may be embarrassed, I might get read, I may have clothing malfunctions, and I may look like crap, but I will be okay, and 3) retail therapy really works.

Good luck out there, girls!  I love you all &lt;3

And oh my gosh, did my ass look fantastic in those jeans.  They were $100, but... I had a little spare money, so I reasoned that since I was so proud of myself for successfully dealing with that day, I deserved something nice and expensive, especially if it made me look nice.  And then we went home!\n\nIn retrospect, it was one of the best experiences of my life, because I learned three really important things: 1) That old saying is true: people are way too busy paying attention to themselves to ever notice you; 2) I may be embarrassed, I might get read, I may have clothing malfunctions, and I may look like crap, but I will be okay, and 3) retail therapy really works.\n\nGood luck out there, girls!

I apologize for the amount of time it took to get that corrected and for peoples comments to be undeleted, there were several fires to put out at once and it took longer than expected. 

After the green text was undone I deleted the metaposts about the green text because the point was now moot, and the issue was fixed. If you want to discuss issues brought about by that feel free to do so in this thread and I will address the concerns of the members of this community, and only the members of this community.

If you come from another subreddit and you aren't trans you can go back where you came from, your comments and posts will be deleted.

If you are here to promote your breakaway subreddit because you hate everything about me, your posts will be deleted and you can go back to your sub and take care of it. You have already been added to the sidebar, you have fair coverage now take off.

If you want a lighter hand in moderation in a trans subreddit might i recommend [/r/trans](/r/trans) they are good people who run the sub and they submit content here on a regular basis and while we disagree on moderation styles we can still hold respectful dialogue with one another. I will probably cross post content there myself. The reason im recommending them is because of the following reasons.

1. Their subreddit is older.

2. The mods didn't create it in a hissy fit about mod policy, they have been respectful about their disagreements and I think this will create a better tone for a healthy subreddit. 

3. They didnt violate reddit TOS in the creation of their sub, ratta did by posting screenshots of mod convos, other mods here have been discussing the issue with the admins so that sub might not even be around for very much longer, I have stayed out of that conversation because i do have a personal stake in it.



One more thing.

If you came here from [/r/gaymers](/r/gaymers) or [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow) and you stick around just to shitpost and downvote everything people you have no inherent right to be here, this community is not for you. Our rules do not cater to you and this is not new.

If you came there and you actually want to be a part of this community do yourselves a favor and learn how we operate and respect our rules and traditions. If you do so you wont have a problem.

I wanted to hear some opinions on something that has happened to me for a while now. I hear many trans people out there would really live their lives hidden, while others not so much.

I recently had a friend give a presentation on acceptance and transgender people in general, and to my dismay she used my before and after pics without my permission. I don't mind, I'm pretty laid back, but I would hate it if I still lived in that city (or country, for that matter). At least I think it was a good cause.

On the other hand I've also openly given presentations of transgender issues in general. But outside all of that I really don't talk about my past. I'm actually trying to start up a nationwide (US &amp; internet based) activism/information group and anyone is welcome to join me :) But, I was wondering what the rest of [/r/transgender](/r/transgender)  thinks.

Alot's happened. And for a change of pace, I'm not going to talk about it, but something else entirely. Since I and a couple other people are making a new space, however, in light of what has gone on, many might see it as another splinter.

Actually, I'm just writing to let you, and people in every single related subreddit I can find (from the larger r/lgbt to the asexual community), about a new project on its way.

To keep it brief, we have the idea of forming a small Big Siblings program on this site. It would be intended to serve the mentoring needs of all people with non-normative sexualities or gender identities/presentations.

We're still coordinating, but there are a few things worth noting here that are already solid. 

None of the moderators of this space will have any affiliation with any moderators of any other space, no crossover or overlap. The polarizing events across multiple boards make crossover inappropriate, especially given the sensitive challenge and special needs of those who would be seeking mentors in the forum.

It won't be a discussion forum. People will be gently encouraged into all the various subreddits available to them, with neither judgment nor preference on our part, to have public discussions as they wish. Our place will be only for collecting posts from those volunteering as mentors and those looking to be mentored.

Finally, mentors will be held to high standards of conduct and verification (though in no way are required to share any identifying information), and as such will never be drawn from those who have made their names by way of polarizing activities, on either side of any particular controversy.

We thought you all here might appreciate being aware of this coming service and space, and welcome questions. Further, if the moderators here deem this post inappropriate, deleting it won't result in any private message fussing or other harassment.

Okay. Before I get too far along, this is sexually explicit, long, may trigger some bad memories/feelings for some readers and was deeply emotionally painful to write. Thanks for reading. 

I'm a twenty-three year old *person* presenting male to my family, friends and community. I'm not 100% about my own gender identity. This post was inspired by [this article](http://autogyn.blogspot.com/2011/03/what-you-need-to-do-if-you-have.html), which I found here on /r/transgender. There were a *ton* of things in the article that I related to and identified with and for the first time in my life, felt compelled to really hash the whole thing out. Although it wasn't quite 100%, you might say that it described me to a ""t"".  Pun intended. And then was more or less punched in the stomach when I saw her [follow up](http://reneettobe.blogspot.com/) and the fact that she's more or less disappeared. … Help?

**Background**

I've got memories of expressing femininity from about the age of five, which is really the earliest I remember anything I guess. I've got two older sisters and two younger sisters and loved playing with their EZ-bake oven. A (male) friend of mine (who later came out as gay) and I would often wear dresses while we were playing together. I loved helping my younger sisters do their hair and painted my nails with them. I was always jealous of the vast array of clothing options women had and would look at the 'intimates' section of the Kohls, JC Penny, etc. ads in the Saturday paper not for sexual pleasure, but because I a) was jealous of how gorgeous they looked and b) wanted a body (the body of the women in the ads) that required a bra and women's underwear. I cried *a lot* during emotional movies (and even some that weren't that emotional…) something that continued through junior high. I enjoyed playing my sisters' ""My Little Pony"" computer game and often used a female avatar when I played my own RPGs. 

HOWEVER, I was also a pretty masculine little guy. I loved the power rangers, sports, (still do!) listened to ""dude"" music--a lot of heavy metal and hard rock--and was sexually interested in girls. So while my parents definitely saw me engage in some ""feminine"" behavior, my mutual love for masculine things led them not to question the feminine stuff, and I think they just chalked it up to me being the only boy among the four sisters. I didn't even really think about any of this stuff until I was 12 or so, when….

**Junior High** (NSFW)

I think I was probably thirteen or so when I first cross-dressed.  If I remember correctly, I tried to fashion a g-string out of yarn.  Needless to say, it didn’t go very well. I don’t really understand it, and maybe that’s part of why it scares me. It started, I think, in my seventh grade math class, when I saw a girl’s thong sticking out of her jeans.  It was extraordinarily arousing and led to the aforementioned tailoring attempt.  That probably would have been spring of my seventh grade year.  That summer I got into the clothes my old (female) babysitter was keeping at our house while she lived in Atlanta. Nothing too scandalous, just some skirts and shirts. I ""borrowed"" a pair of panties and bra from one of my older sisters and some makeup from our mom. Although I was in *zero* way passing, it felt absolutely amazing to be wearing what felt like the right clothes and was a great experience.

I started looking at porn, even though I wasn't masturbating, and immediately envisioned myself as the girl. I then started to realize that what I was doing was ""cross-dressing"" and asked the Internet what that meant. Next thing I know, I'm fully dressed/made up, laying on my back in my bathroom and cumming into my own mouth. (Like I said, sexually explicit, I'm sorry.) It was then that I had the first feelings of shame about what I was doing and so began a long long series of buy girl clothes, experience the release, feel the guilt, purge, repeat. 

There's always been a very real sexual undercurrent to the whole thing, and if I hadn't been as feminine as I was when I was a little kid/a non-sexual being, I would totally have chalked the whole thing up to transvestic fetishism and left it at that. Unfortunately, not so.

**Bi-gendered?** (NSFW)

I've thought for a while that maybe I'm bi-gendered. Gender fluid. Both? I get that every single person has both ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" characteristics. I also enjoy putting on a suit, (which doesn't feel weird!) playing football and basketball, am definitely a ""type-a"", take-charge personality.

Sexually, though, I'm definitely more submissive, although I've got a small dom part, too. One of the few times I ever didn't feel guilt after orgasm while either wearing women's clothes or envisioning myself as a woman engaged in heterosexual (with a male) sex was the one time I answered a Craigslist (BAD idea, I know, I know!) personal for a crossdresser. I'll spare you the details, but after he was done, I left and when I got home, was not plagued by the guilt that I had grown accustomed to, which felt as you might imagine *amazing*.

I thought maybe I was turning a corner and was becoming more comfortable with who I was, although I was still skeptical that it was still a purely sexual thing, because it was in that part of my life that my femininity most readily and frequently manifested itself. And then it just kind of went away for a while. I've enjoyed a pretty good sex life with women and haven't ever had too much an issue there. But now it's come back with a vengeance. Almost all of the porn I watch is of pre-op transwomen and I *always* envision myself as that woman *or* it's female pov. When my gf is going down on me, I can only get off if I imagine I'm a woman being fingered/fucked by a guy. 

Something else that's… odd? is that when I visualize myself as a woman, the woman I want to be, I am very much attracted to men. But when I'm not, I'm attracted to (and still jealous of) women. 

One of the biggest things that I think runs contrary to the possibility of being bi-gendered, however, is the fact that if I could go back and choose, before I was born, a gender, it would be female, hands down, no question.

**Barriers**

Aside from my current girlfriend, who I adore but have only been seeing for a month, my dad and I have a really close father-son connection that he doesn't have with any of my other (all-female) siblings. I feel like this would crush him if he knew.

That and I'm super-duper tall, 6'5"" and pretty hairy. I think passing is probably out of the question...

   

Gaaaah crazy. This is making my head hurt.

tl;dr self-identified autogynephile but perhaps suppressed transwoman considering transition   

Any thoughts/advice would be incredibly appreciated.

Thank you.

Before I get too far along, this is sexually explicit, long, may trigger some bad memories/feelings for some readers and was deeply emotionally painful to write. Thanks for reading. \n\nI\'m a twenty-three year old *person* presenting male to my family, friends and community. I\'m not 100% about my own gender identity. This post was inspired by [this article](http://autogyn.blogspot.com/2011/03/what-you-need-to-do-if-you-have.html), which I found here on /r/transgender. There were a *ton* of things in the article that I related to and identified with and for the first time in my life, felt compelled to really hash the whole thing out. Although it wasn\'t quite 100%, you might say that it described me to a ""t"".  Pun intended. And then was more or less punched in the stomach when I saw her [follow up](http://reneettobe.blogspot.com/) and the fact that she\'s more or less disappeared. … Help?\n\n**Background**\n\nI\'ve got memories of expressing femininity from about the age of five, which is really the earliest I remember anything I guess. I\'ve got two older sisters and two younger sisters and loved playing with their EZ-bake oven. A (male) friend of mine (who later came out as gay) and I would often wear dresses while we were playing together. I loved helping my younger sisters do their hair and painted my nails with them. I was always jealous of the vast array of clothing options women had and would look at the \'intimates\' section of the Kohls, JC Penny, etc. ads in the Saturday paper not for sexual pleasure, but because I a) was jealous of how gorgeous they looked and b) wanted a body (the body of the women in the ads) that required a bra and women\'s underwear. I cried *a lot* during emotional movies (and even some that weren\'t that emotional…) something that continued through junior high. I enjoyed playing my sisters\' ""My Little Pony"" computer game and often used a female avatar when I played my own RPGs. \n\nHOWEVER, I was also a pretty masculine little guy. I loved the power rangers, sports, (still do!) listened to ""dude"" music--a lot of heavy metal and hard rock--and was sexually interested in girls. So while my parents definitely saw me engage in some ""feminine"" behavior, my mutual love for masculine things led them not to question the feminine stuff, and I think they just chalked it up to me being the only boy among the four sisters. I didn\'t even really think about any of this stuff until I was 12 or so, when….\n\n**Junior High** (NSFW)\n\nI think I was probably thirteen or so when I first cross-dressed.

Here are my questions, thanks for your time!
- When referring to him in the past tense (AKA when he was identifying as a female) do I use ""he"" or ""she""? This confuses me the most because while he is a he now, he was a she then so I'm not sure which form to use.
- When did you personally choose to identify with your ""true"" gender, or are you?
- What are the legal things you've had to deal with such as bathrooms, paperwork, ect...?
- Did it take a long time for you/your family to adjust to the different pronouns and different lifestyle in general?
- Have you had surgery to help become your identified gender biologically? Why or why not?
- Do you wish you had waited longer or shorter to identify as a different gender?

2012-01-25 22:55:35,owpse,2,0,"Now, most of you have probably seen some of the attempts at explaining what causes transsexualism in the past, like Blanchard's hypotheses that fell flat, mainly because his theories really didn't explain anything and basically demonized trans women who experienced fetishism as perverts driven by their fetish.

I am going to attempt to explain why transsexuals, specifically trans women (though I will have a part about trans men in this) experience fetishism. My attempt is based on recent science and my own experiences, and includes as little cissexism as possible.

Now, in my little hypothesis, I am going to use a few words (some I just made up) I would like to define:

* **Autogynesomaticism** - the tendency for a person to fantasize about having a female body, regardless of the current state of their body
* **Autoandrosomaticism** - the tendency for a person to fantasize about having a male body, regardless of the current state of their body
* **Autogynesomatic/Autoandrosomatic fetishism** - sexual arousal that comes from fantasizing about having a female/male body
* **Sexual identity** - basically synonymous with gender identity, but gets the point across that this has to do with both gender and sex
* **Neurological sex** - a person's neurological sex is the sex their brain is neurologically similar to
* **Transvestic fetishism** - a fetish for crossdressing
* **Transgender transformation idealization** - the desire to change one's physical sex, with fantastic ideas involving impossible science, magic or divine intervention
* **Transgender transformation fetishism** - a fetish that involves sexual arousal from transgender transformation scenes or fantasies

Now, with that out of the way (I hope you don't mind the new terms I just coined :P), I want to explain where my explanation is coming from. I'm a trans woman who grew up with a bit of an internal struggle after I hit puberty, all of which stemmed from my female sexual identity. I was afraid to admit that I felt like a girl, and all of my sexual fantasies involved me being female. Cisnormative sexual fantasies did nothing for me. I also experienced transvestic fetishism since around the start of puberty, but that fetish is gone now that I have gained more self acceptance and have made dressing a regular thing.

I made a similar post on 420chan's /cd/ board in response to someone posting Blanchard's bullshit, and I thought I'd rewrite it here to see what you all think.

2012-01-26 01:32:34,owxcy,34,93,"Tuesday morning, I had no intentions on coming out to anyone. Being fairly sure I would be fired for attempting to come out at work, enjoying having my insurance provided at work (as it pays fully for therapy and HRT), and unwillingness to risk it all until it was a requirement and backup plans could be formulated, it was just supposed to be a normal day. 

And it was up until after lunch. 

One of my friends who works near I work decided to take me out to Steak and Shake to talk about some unrelated business. After lunch he dropped me off and I walked back to my station. As I walked back, one of my co-workers came up to me and decided to bug me about random things. Work related, non-work related, why the freakin' sky was blue. Just everything. He does this shit constantly, so much that he actually caused fist-fights with other former employees (after throwing the first punch). Can't be fired, since he's related to the owners of the company (nepotism at its finest). Not to mention that up until that day I had always tried to be on his good side, since he had seen me out with a group of friends as my true self.

However back to the details.

After being showered with questions about everything under the sun for a good 10-15 minutes, my rage got the better of me and I quite firmly and politely informed him to ""shut the hell up and let me get back to work"". Catching what I had said, and knowing that physical fights with this employee had broken out for less, I knew I was in for it. I lucked out though, only causing a verbal confrontation with him in a yelling match that lasted a good 20 minutes. At the climax I exclaimed ""I quit"" and walked up front.

Nearly in tears, shaking I walked towards the front door of the building, where I was greeted by my boss who took me into his office. I explained the situation to him and laid everything out on the table. My keys, key card, the entire list of administrative passwords. Everything. He told me to think about what I was doing and if I really wanted to let this situation play out like this. 

At that point, my mind raced immediately to the employee knowing about my identity. The company I work for is really ass backwards so them finding out about that, I thought, could make them not want me as an employee anymore, since I had clients who were highly valuable to the company and might not be accepting of this information either. 

I had planned on going full time by the end of the year anyways, and I didn't want to have it be told and get fired for an ""Unrelated issue"". So I told my boss. I told my boss about my identity, the therapy, what my plans were, what my plans were after my transition, and how I felt it would affect the company. 

Nothing was really said to me, but he called his wife in, who happens to be HR/Payroll/Receptionist/Co-owner. He asked me to repeat what I had told him, so I did. At that point I was dismissed for the day and I went home.

I went home and cried for a good 2 hours, thinking I had just lost my HRT, Therapy and my Job. 

About 5PM rolls around and my Dad shows up unexpectedly. I look like shit in a handbasket, with a puffy face, bloodshot eyes and tear soaked hoodie. So when I opened my door, he knew something was up. I sat him down on the couch and as I began to tell him I think I lost my job I start crying.

My dad is one of those guys that are ""Boys don't cry"" and all rough and macho. Eats nails and tacks for breakfast, y'know. That type.

So he starts in about being a man and taking responsibility. At that point I stop him and say ""I have no problem taking responsibility, but I am *not* a man."" and I proceed to tell him the events of why I thought I was going to be fired and about transitioning.

I had never been so belittled in my life. Starting in with the ""My son will not be some man in a dress"" and going on about how I was some sissy bitch to him now, that I was dead to him, he stormed out of my apartment.

More Crying. And then I passed out in my closet.

The next day, no one said anything to me. Nothing happend, it was quiet.

I show up to work today, and my boss's wife hands me a file containing all the information for new hires and tax forms. She then tells me about how she had a friend who went through the same situation and she would personally see that whatever I needed I got help with. ""The forms are for when you're ready to come out full time, so we'll need all your new information."" She was really amazing about it and after work we spent an hour talking about different things. Was the first time I actually got to know her.

Then My Dad came by after work (with my stepmom), and apologized.  He asked a bunch of questions about why I was transitioning (why I felt I needed to, was it something he did, if I was sure...etc.) and asked if he could go to therapy with me. I told him that I was pretty sure it was a private session only, but I could set up a family one or we could go to a group session. We hugged for the first time since I graduated the 6th grade (I'm 22). My stepmom hugged me and said that they had talked to the rest of the family, and even though they personally ready to see me transition, the rest of my family was awaiting seeing me (little did they know that almost everyone else knew already, but...).

And that was that. They just left. And I'm still here.

**TL;DR**: Shit hit the fan at work, felt forced to come out so I did; More shit hit the fan, got sent home early;cried, Manly-Man Dad came over and discovered me crying, told to man up; Come out to Dad, diarrhea is now being sprayed from metaphorical fan, cry more.

People either come to such places with questions regarding trans-specific things, with news as it relates to us, or to seek affirmation. For the purposes of this, I'm ignoring the people who come to such places to stir shit up.


I propose a different theme, then. Let's talk about the shit that makes us happy. Whether it's being ma'am'd at the checkout at a grocery store, or the sun on your face, or the types of music you rock the shit out of.. movies.. books, hobbies, activities, sports, cars, favorite philosophy topics, favorite methods of retail therapy.

Dun care xD just feel like stirring up something good. The point of transitioning is being happy, so things that make ya happy and related discussion seems like a relevant topic.



I'll start, then, as is only appropriate as I've brought it up!

Things that make me happy in no particular order:

- Dance movies. I love how those people move (step it up, etc)
- Sunsets, the way, every once and a while.. they can set the whole sky on fire. (Sunrises can kiss my ass, however)
- Cooking spicy things
- The smell of coffee brewing in the morning, the world's way of telling ya today is going to be a good day
- Music (Avenged Sevenfold, video game scores, disturbed, evanescence, everlast, Finger 11, Cauterize, Halestorm, Dabears, Lacuna Coil, Linkin Park, Metric, Murder of My Sweet, Nightwish, Rev Theory, Social Code, 3 Days Grace, Tool, Vanilla Ninja, Within Temptation.. to name a few &gt;.&gt;;)
- Things that go boom
- Apple bottom jeans
- Mythbusters
- '93 RX7 FD
- Bioware games in general
- Nicotine (goodbye, my sweet)
- Voyaging through social norms
- my lil pet mexican
- Watching professional starcraft 2
- Firefly references (squeeeee)
- oceanside sushi
- Animating
- Sarongs (my preferred incarnation of pj's)
- Reaching out and touching people. Appropriately, inappropriately, emotionally, and like a quivering palm.
- really obscure references that I get",transgender,Things that make you happy!,1327629339.0,"{'created_utc': 1327604139, 'id': 'oxx60', 'num_comments': 22, 'score': 10, 'selftext': ""It's been my experience (limited experience, at that) in online trans-friendly spaces, that such spaces tend to be fairly polarized and thematic. \n\nPeople either come to such places with questions regarding trans-specific things, with news as it relates to us, or to seek affirmation.

While it does explicitly mention matching Gender with the person and their ID. Getting the sex on your ID changed is simple in Canada. You merely require a letter from a doctor.

As far as I know, no one has been hassled because of these laws, so there really isn't a problem despite this story claiming there is.

Hello, I found your email on www.transgendermichigan.com, and I was hoping I could find someone to talk to about my gender identity. A little bit about myself: I have always had an issue with my gender identity, ever since middle school when I would feel jealous of other girls, wishing I could have long hair and wear makeup and girl clothes. I kept it to myself and never thought much of it. I've always felt distant and disconnected from males and never seem to have anything in common with most of them. Around my freshman year of high school I began to fantasize more and more about becoming a girl, and about men. These feelings and thoughts grew and grew until I knew at age 16 that I wanted to become a girl. I told a few friends to build a support group, then told my sister, who told my mom. At that moment my whole life crashed. She had a very negative reaction and it traumatized me, sending me into a deep depression. Whenever I wear women's clothing, I feel comfortable, safe, at ease and I don't feel like I'm faking anything. I feel like I'm me, and I feel genuine and happy. I hope you receive this email, and if you could make time for me in your schedule, that would be great. I've had 2 therapists so far, and neither of them have been helpful with my transgender issues. Thank you.

P.S. Here's a timeline of events in my life, thought it might be a good idea. Throughout this entire timeline I was crossdressing:


12: Fantasizing about becoming a girl starts, feeling jealous at school
14: Sexually attracted to men, daily thoughts about being a girl
July, 2010: Told my parents, became extremely depressed
August 2010: Very depressed, forced attempts to date girls ends in my personal uncomfort and I feel ashamed and embarrassed
September 2010: Put into a day program for depression
October 2010: I become suicidal and I am put in white pines mental hospital for depression and suicidal thoughts
November 2010: Begin cutting myself, cuts are mostly superficial and the scars heal
December 2010: Depressed and feeling suicidal on a hourly basis, failing school, medications (Wellbutrin and Abilifiy) have little to no effect
February 2011: Slowly feeling a little better, at this point I have not had a conversation about what was said last July
April 2011: Lost most of my friends due to panic attacks caused by Wellbutrin, I would become very emotionally attached to them (all of them girls, as a purely friendship thing) and then ruin the friendship somehow
May 2011: My mom discovers my ipod touch and goes through my history, discovering my search for information about Transgenderism and Male to female Transgenders. I panic and Cut myself very deeply, the cut was a quarter inch thick and 3 inches long and I still have the
     scar to this day. It is a daily reminder of the pain I feel
June 2011: Become friends with my best friends' (Colby)  girlfriend, lindsay. They both know (I considered myself transgender) that I'm transgender and gay and I would never try to date her. I had constant panic attacks, but every once in a while everything would be fine and we would go shopping for clothes, which made me feel very comfortable and free. It was liberating to wear skinny jeans and women's underwear. I felt happy.
July 2011: I have my 18th birthday on the 3rd of July, and on the following day I have a severe mental breakdown because of my parents and my friend lindsay and her boyfriend (my friend) colby. I also move to Royal Oak for my work term (I attend Kettering University as an Electrical Engineering Major and science has been my passion and foothold in life) which consists of 3 months of school and 3 months of class. I live in royal oak from the End of July to mid september. It was good to be away from parents and to be by myself.
August 2011: I lose Lindsay and Colby as friends, I now have no friends, except for a few high school freshman that were on the robotics team. I am extremely depressed and I am close to committing suicide many times. I had very severe anxieties about becoming a woman and I purchase hormones from the internet and begin taking them.
September 2011: I lose the high school freshman girls as friends, I feel very alone and sad, I cry almost everyday and I don't cut myself because they would see it at work (I worked 3 months at Bosch Engineering) which only added to the problem. Luckily the work term ends and I'm looking forward to starting my classes at college.
First couple weeks of college, End of September/October 2011: I attended a LGBT meeting for Kettering Students, and met Cassy and Chris. Cassy is a Bi female, and Chris is a transgender female (male to female, although chris presented as male). We are friends, then Cassy tries to hook us up and we interact sexually. It was very shocking and upsetting and nerve wrecking and I stop talking to them both. However, during a shopping trip with cassy and Chris, where they helped me pick out girl clothes, which I bought, I met a old acquaintance from high school, Holly. We become friends and we hang out after I stop talking to Cassy. She takes me shopping and is my only friend during college. On my first day of college, I paint my nails, and wear skinny jeans and girly clothes, and try to be as feminine as possible. Everyone is very nice and accepting and I don't receive any negativity because of it. I felt AMAZING! It was the happiest week or two of my entire life. I felt like I could be myself and everyone was happy for me. I loved every second of my life, and felt like I could do anything. I would have occasional negative thoughts about my transition, but for those two weeks nothing could get in the way of me being happy. I came out to many people, and word spread around the high school and social networking media. I didn't care, I didn't want to hide who I was anymore.
Mid to late October, 2011: Suddenly I hit a wall, and I begin feeling very depressed about my transition and my body. I felt like I wasn't feminine enough for society or myself and I began feeling extremely depressed almost immediately. I soon started cutting myself again towards the end of october, and after a talk with my RA (housing assistant, I was living in the dorms) she sent me to the college counselor, who said Kettering can't have an actively suicidal student on campus. I was sent to McLaren hospital's behavioral medicine ward for a few days.

At that moment my whole life crashed. She had a very negative reaction and it traumatized me, sending me into a deep depression. Whenever I wear women's clothing, I feel comfortable, safe, at ease and I don't feel like I'm faking anything. I feel like I'm me, and I feel genuine and happy. I hope you receive this email, and if you could make time for me in your schedule, that would be great. I've had 2 therapists so far, and neither of them have been helpful with my transgender issues. Thank you.\n\nP.S. Here's a timeline of events in my life, thought it might be a good idea. Throughout this entire timeline I was crossdressing:\n\n\n12: Fantasizing about becoming a girl starts, feeling jealous at school\n14: Sexually attracted to men, daily thoughts about being a girl\nJuly, 2010: Told my parents, became extremely depressed\nAugust 2010: Very depressed, forced attempts to date girls ends in my personal uncomfort and I feel ashamed and embarrassed\nSeptember 2010: Put into a day program for depression\nOctober 2010: I become suicidal and I am put in white pines mental hospital for depression and suicidal thoughts\nNovember 2010: Begin cutting myself, cuts are mostly superficial and the scars heal\nDecember 2010: Depressed and feeling suicidal on a hourly basis, failing school, medications (Wellbutrin and Abilifiy) have little to no effect\nFebruary 2011: Slowly feeling a little better, at this point I have not had a conversation about what was said last July\nApril 2011: Lost most of my friends due to panic attacks caused by Wellbutrin, I would become very emotionally attached to them (all of them girls, as a purely friendship thing) and then ruin the friendship somehow\nMay 2011: My mom discovers my ipod touch and goes through my history, discovering my search for information about Transgenderism and Male to female Transgenders. I panic and Cut myself very deeply, the cut was a quarter inch thick and 3 inches long and I still have the\n     scar to this day. It is a daily reminder of the pain I feel\nJune 2011: Become friends with my best friends' (Colby)  girlfriend, lindsay. They both know (I considered myself transgender) that I'm transgender and gay and I would never try to date her. I had constant panic attacks, but every once in a while everything would be fine and we would go shopping for clothes, which made me feel very comfortable and free. It was liberating to wear skinny jeans and women's underwear. I felt happy.\nJuly 2011: I have my 18th birthday on the 3rd of July, and on the following day I have a severe mental breakdown because of my parents and my friend lindsay and her boyfriend (my friend) colby. I also move to Royal Oak for my work term (I attend Kettering University as an Electrical Engineering Major and science has been my passion and foothold in life) which consists of 3 months of school and 3 months of class. I live in royal oak from the End of July to mid september. It was good to be away from parents and to be by myself.\nAugust 2011: I lose Lindsay and Colby as friends, I now have no friends, except for a few high school freshman that were on the robotics team. I am extremely depressed and I am close to committing suicide many times. I had very severe anxieties about becoming a woman and I purchase hormones from the internet and begin taking them.\nSeptember 2011: I lose the high school freshman girls as friends, I feel very alone and sad, I cry almost everyday and I don't cut myself because they would see it at work (I worked 3 months at Bosch Engineering) which only added to the problem. Luckily the work term ends and I'm looking forward to starting my classes at college.\nFirst couple weeks of college, End of September/October 2011: I attended a LGBT meeting for Kettering Students, and met Cassy and Chris. Cassy is a Bi female, and Chris is a transgender female (male to female, although chris presented as male). We are friends, then Cassy tries to hook us up and we interact sexually. It was very shocking and upsetting and nerve wrecking and I stop talking to them both. However, during a shopping trip with cassy and Chris, where they helped me pick out girl clothes, which I bought, I met a old acquaintance from high school, Holly. We become friends and we hang out after I stop talking to Cassy. She takes me shopping and is my only friend during college. On my first day of college, I paint my nails, and wear skinny jeans and girly clothes, and try to be as feminine as possible. Everyone is very nice and accepting and I don't receive any negativity because of it. I felt AMAZING! It was the happiest week or two of my entire life. I felt like I could be myself and everyone was happy for me. I loved every second of my life, and felt like I could do anything. I would have occasional negative thoughts about my transition, but for those two weeks nothing could get in the way of me being happy. I came out to many people, and word spread around the high school and social networking media. I didn't care, I didn't want to hide who I was anymore.\nMid to late October, 2011: Suddenly I hit a wall, and I begin feeling very depressed about my transition and my body. I felt like I wasn't feminine enough for society or myself and I began feeling extremely depressed almost immediately. I soon started cutting myself again towards the end of october, and after a talk with my RA (housing assistant, I was living in the dorms) she sent me to the college counselor, who said Kettering can't have an actively suicidal student on campus. I was sent to McLaren hospital's behavioral medicine ward for a few days.\n"", 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': 'Letter I wrote to a Transgender Therapist', 'created': 1328020135.0}"

2012-01-31 18:44:26,p4v7f,0,1,"I went to my doctor today to see if I could get different HRT prescriptions.  My insurance changed, so my monthly prescription expenses went from $35 a month to about $150 a month.  I was taking PremPhase, which is a 28-pill blister pack of 14x0.625mg Premarin  and 14x0.625mg Premarin with 5mg Provera, plus an extra scrip of daily 0.625mg Premarin, both of which are somewhat expensive.  I had been taking the Premphase for the past three years, and have had a good experience with it, adding in the extra Premarin last year for a little bit of estrogen boost.  Now, I've started taking 1mg daily of Estradiol and a two week on, two week off, cycle of 200mg daily of Prometrium, which is about $5 a month for the estradiol and $58 a month for the Prometrium.  I'm hoping that switching out the meds will spark another round of feminization, which seems to happen every time my scrips are updated.  I'm very hopeful for the benefits I've heard about taking Prometrium over Provera, namely extra breast tissue development and maturation.  If I can get a little boost there, I'll hopefully feel a lot less like getting a boobjob.  If not, well, guess I'll be running up a credit card next year.

Anyone else tried both of these combinations for post-op HRT treatment?  Any comparisons you could make, or interesting experiences with these meds?  My doctor is very cool and knowledgeable, and trusts me to handle my own experimentation with medication dosages, so there may be some tweaking of dosages and timing to maximize the benefits.",transgender,"Got new HRT scrips today, let's see how well these work...",1328060666.0,"{'created_utc': 1328035466, 'id': 'p4v7f', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""I went to my doctor today to see if I could get different HRT prescriptions.
