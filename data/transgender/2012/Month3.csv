2012-03-01 17:31:05,qd54y,26,24,"For anyone reading this, thank you. I have been putting this off for too long now.

For those short on time I'll add a TL:DR at the bottom.

I am a 21 year old Biological Male, serving in the US Army. This is my story, and this is where I ask for your help.

Since my childhood I've know something about myself was ""different"" than most of the people around me. I don't think I have *ever* felt comfortable with my body. One of my earliest childhood memories take place in a shower, I'm 4 or 5 years old, still young enough to be being bathed by my mother. I know our bodies are different. Something is wrong, because even then, as a child, I knew mine should be like hers. So I reach down and *adjust* as necessary, ""Look Mommy, I'm just like you"" I say with a true honest smile.

Some time later as a pre-teen my emotions start to catch up with me. Family difficulties, legal problems, social services, foster care, and other traumatic life events racked my world. I have pretty much always been a odd boy. Never really making friends, never enjoying what the other boys find happiness in. I liked being left alone to my thoughts, I loved to imagine a different world for myself. I started to sink into depression, and isolation, soon I had an eating disorder, next I started self harming.

I did my best in high school. I hide well among the crowds. Stayed positive, worked to better my future. I made some friends, tried to fit in, worked my damnest to find a sport or hobby that fulfilled me. Nothing filled the gap inside me. I held my life together not for myself anymore, but for others. By 15 I had almost given up on ever finding happiness, I couldn't figure out what was missing in life.

Slowly I found myself being more and more interested in stereotypically ""feminine"" things. It didn't bother me, it did the opposite, it made me happy. I now lived a secret life, by day I was the stern masculine high school athlete, by night I wrote poems, listened to love songs, real romantic novels, and dreamed of the day I'd find a magical way to wake up from the dream world I lived in.
I didn't know a thing. My knowledge of LGBT was next to none. I had no notion of transgender, HRT, SRS, anything outside the *norms*.

I don't know how it came up but I remember my parents telling me the origin of my name. They told me they had decided on names before they knew my sex, ""William if it's a boy, Veronica if it's a girl."" I *feel* like a Veronica... It brings me to tears thinking how close I was.

A couple at my highschool changed my views on everything. Two girls, in love, a happy highschool couple. Something clicked in my mind when I saw them. they were both girls but it didn't matter! what the world around them said didn't matter, they were happy.

I began to explore myself and grown. By 2009 I had myself mostly figured out, I was sure I was female, trapped in a male body. I was also sure there was nothing I could ever do to magically change that. So I tried to repress it. I attempted to be *normal* I decided to make my family proud, to get a job and start earning my way in the world. To better myself and become the best person I could ever be. If I couldn't help myself, well then maybe I could do some good for others. I worked very hard at managing my self harm, the only thing left over from my eating disorder was a lot of extra pounds. I took care of that weight with hard work and dedication. After graduation I  enlisted in the US Army. 

Inspired, dedicated, 110 pounds lighter, I had begun my time in the army. For a time it felt like that would be enough. It wasn't. I soon found myself yearning for the life I didn't have. Dreaming my dreams as a woman, waking up in horror of what I really was. I tried to have a healthy relationship. I fell in love with a good friend. She and I did well together for a time. So well that eventually, during leave from my deployment to Iraq I proposed to her. I was happy, almost complete, only a little part of me was missing, but that little bit always nagged at me.

I tried to talk to my fiance. I explained how I felt. I let her know everything. I hoped she would accept me. She didn't take it so well. She didn't or couldn't accept my identity, she refused to accept my sexuality. Things ended poorly. 

With some time in between to wallow in self pity... here I am. My contract will be over in 18 months, at which time it will become legal for me to start my transition. My hope is to move to Oregon for college. 

Thank you for reading my story, and please, advice, tips, kind words, stories of your life, I would love to hear it all. I'm finally becoming my true self I would like to get to know others as her.

TL:DR: Hard life, gender confusion, discovered myself and my gender identities, currently MtF pre-everything in the US Army waiting for her time to end so she can start her life.

2012-03-01 20:19:16,qddbn,15,6,"This is a little diddle I just needed to get off my chest and post somewhere. 

There are these moments where I forget I'm in a mans body. When I close my eyes, when I turn off the lights, during sex, sometimes even when I'm just walking no where in particular, or doing nothing exciting. It's not like my body floats away, but more like my soul fills in the extra space. It's in these times I feel the most like myself. When I'm like that, my friends notice, and comment, ""I feel like your aura is extra shiny today,"" or, ""I just love how joyful you are!""
These moments are some of the happiest moments of my life. But they're fleeting. With a tilt of my head, a flick of a switch, or a glance in the bathroom mirror I see a bigger frame, bigger hands, hairy legs, flat chest, no vagina. 

That shattering feeling when you look down and don't identify with your body. That one glance is ruining my happiest moments. 

It's that glance that makes me want hormones, makes me want to change what I've called me for so long. But is that enough to warrant change? Why can't I be happy with what I have? I mean, I'm happy. right? 

I have friends, I have a job, a house, a loving family. I should be content. But something in me doesn't feel right. Part of me is telling me that my body is wrong, but the other part is making excuses. Telling me I'm just insecure. That my body is the one I'm supposed to have, I've just got to live with it. Still I moisturize my face to make it look smoother, wear feminine cut jeans, and tight shirts, and fight in the never ending war against body hair. There are two parts of me fighting. And the only side that's losing is myself.

Sometimes I push that feminine feeling down and try to forget about it. I let my beard grow out, find those baggy jeans from high school, and sulk for the whole week. But that feminine feeling I'm repressing? It comes back. Only stronger than before. That's how I lost half the hair on my right leg. One of those moments I just couldn't live with hair there, so I gritted my teeth as I dragged the epilator up my leg. kept taking shots of vodka till I was numb, and reality was just a dull ache from my ankle to my knee.

I can't keep on doing this. Fighting with myself. It's just not working. But I also can't work up the courage to go get that prescription, or even take them once I have them.
I don't know what they'll do to me. Who I'll become, or where I'll end up. Furthermore, I've never wanted to be a slave to the pill. I don't know if I can handle taking spiro and estrogen till the day I die. Let alone afford it.

All these insecurities, all this pressure to decide. And whenever I think about any of this, I forget to live my life. I've got so many obligations, so many things I have to do, so many people counting on me. I don't have time to worry about my gender. Yet my gender has become an integral part of me.

Today I went to see my sister, she works for him. When I got there he wasn't there so I just figured I'd stop in and talk to her for a bit. 

She seemed uncomfortable and on edge of me being there... I really wanted to just talk to her. She was being very introverted the whole time. When I mentioned my dad had removed me from his face book she tried to use the excuse that he saw a picture of me hugging a guy. Which is bullshit because he removed me before I posted that picture, and that picture only went up on my female facebook that my dad hasn't been friended too. 


I let her tell me that was the reason. But I knew it wasn't true. 

We sat in quiet for a bit and when I asked her how he was doing she said he would be in in a bit. Well at that point he made his appearance walking in. 


I felt the anger and hatred pouring off him. I've always been able to feel energy, but everything pouring off him was red, and orange, and black, and angry. All of it targeted at me. I instantly felt completely out of place. He put his stuff in his chair and disappeared into the back, never saying a word to me. My sister told me I needed to go...


When I got back to my own office, I got a message from her saying

Sister: ""Dad would like to ask nicely that you not drop by the office anymore.""


At that point I started to cry. Hard. I excused myself from my desk and went to the bathroom to finish.

I knew he disliked that I made this choice. But I never thought he would really ""excommunicate"" me. Abjure me... 

When I finished crying and cleaned my face, I went back to my desk and wrote out a blog post thanking him and appologizing, and putting out in public that I would be no long planning to take his name when I finally did my legal name change. 

I even changed my facebook to reflect my Mothers maiden name as my family name, instead of his. 

I will never give blood children to his line, I will never pass on his name either. 

I was his first borne son, now I'm his second daughter. But he can't accept that. So I wont accept him anymore.

[Original Thread Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/qbh6n/request_to_future_makers_of_surveys/)

My stance was that most people would answer male or female based on which gender they identify with but thats a big assumption from someone who has never even known a transgender person (to my knowledge at least).  I would have guessed that it really wouldn't make a difference outside of a survey dealing specifically with lgbt issues.  Correct me if I'm wrong please.

There are 3 questions in the start of this survey, please answer each as you would if it were part of a separate survey, your answers may differ of course.  The rest are some other things I felt would be appropriate.  Is that is confusing just comment here and I'll try and explain better.

&gt;Hello Friends,
&gt; 
&gt;Spring is upon us and so is the fight to protect the rights of Transsexual, Transgender and gender non-conforming Canadians in Parliament.  I am taking the Gender Identity Bill, Bill C-279,  back into the House of Commons for its first hour of second reading for debate in April.  This Bill has made it through the House of Commons once and I believe that we can do it again.  This Bill would add gender identity and gender expression into the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, this may sound small but this Bill could have monumental changes regarding equality in employment, housing, healthcare, mobility and protection for Trans Canadians.
&gt; 
&gt;We need to stand up and tell the government that the rights of Trans people need to be protected, that we are talking about Human Rights not special rights and that we are talking about dignity that is supposed to be enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The NDP stands unanimous in its support of this Bill and now we are looking for the support of all other Parties.
&gt; 
&gt;Here is what you can do to help:
&gt;-Contact to your MP and tell them how important this legislation is to you.  You can find out who your MP is at http://www.elections.ca/scripts/pss/FindED.aspx?L=e. 
&gt;   (If you can meet with your MP in person it’s a lot harder for them to say no to supporting the Bill)
&gt;-Write to the Minister of Justice and tell him how important this legislation is to you. His contact information can be found here, http://www.robnicholsonmp.ca/contact/. 
&gt;-Write to the Prime Minister of Canada and tell him how important this legislation is to you.  His contact information can be found here,  http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/contact.asp. 
&gt;-Tell your friends, families and co-workers and talk about this issue.  Talk about it on your FaceBook, Twitter, blog, and in your community.
&gt; 
&gt;I believe in The Gender Identity Bill and stand committed to equality for all.

I don't know about you, but personally, the rush from shopping for cute women's clothing is one of the things that got me into this whole mess in the first place! However, it didn't take me long to figure out that there were some clothes that were flattering to my feminine body and some clothes that made me look hopelessly mannish (no matter how adorable and cute it was). Thus my female style was born.

Now ladies, I want you to know how much I love you all, but there's something I need to get off my chest. I see girls on here asking all the time about tips for passing and quite honestly I think there are a lot of girls here who could use a tip or two about body shapes &amp; face shapes and how they relate to your choices in necklines, leg widths, colors, patterns and etc. Lines create contours and contours create illusions.  These are things you need to use to your advantage to minimize your shoulders and accentuate your hips. I can say from personal experience that with a specific top, the right pair of jeans is the difference between feeling frumpy and feeling fabulous! Lucky for you, you aren't alone! I see plenty of biological women wearing tremendously more horrid clothing ;) (tights as pants? oh my god...)

I learned very early on that the more feminine you dress the faster you get gendered as a girl. I know that not everyone is shooting for a femme presentation, but regardless of how you present take a moment to realize how much your clothes say about you. That said, I find that the range of feminine is quite large and is pretty much anything that a boy wouldn't wear... Androgynous clothing can be tough, I mean there's a reason it's called androgynous! However, something that I notice about most girls is that they *have* found a specific fashion and style that they like and works for them, and they tend to work within that box. That said, following are some links that have solid advice, some are tailored specifically for trans people with our varied body types.

I am an Indian transwoman living in Canada. I pass for a female, and get treated as such in public. I don't get beaten up for walking down the street, I don't have slurs shouted at me when I go outside. According to the guest blogger these are ""cis privileges"", and if they saw me in public they would be ""justifiably frightened"" of me. This is why I think the idea is cis privilege is absurd, because it not only downplays their experiences but also ours. 

Am I not trans because I pass as a woman? Is it wrong of me to want to be a woman and not genderqueer, androgynous or some other form of TG?

Are people with Gender Identity Disorder ""privileged"" if and when they aren't gender variant?

When I walk in for a job interview and I only see white people working there, I get a nagging feeling, would this be a non-issue if I were cis?

Is it somehow worse that my father calls me faggot than when a cis gay man's father calls him a faggot? I don't see why cis or not cis matters, I have a lot of cis friends, they're great people. Sweeping statements are worthless!

How great it would be if being able to express myself without retaliation would be the end of my problems. But no, I also need to fix my body. I could say I'm lucky that I'll never had a period but I'm terrified of getting breast cancer from my meds. I have food to eat when so many cis people don't. I've never been raped when so many cis people have. I have a roof over my head when so many cis people don't. They do not have an advantage, they simply have a different situation than us.

So I guess because I'm not being discriminated against enough or getting beaten up, I'm not trans enough. I guess I'm not trans enough because I want to, and succeed at, fitting in with cis people. And I guess I'm not trans enough because I'm not thoroughly angry at the world for hating me and my kind. I judge people by actions, not labels. If anyone disagrees with me I guess they can add ""die trans scum"" alongside ""die cis scum"".

2012-03-04 20:09:10,qhi6d,3,5,"Okay. I have no idea how to make this into paragraphs on Reddit.


 I'm giving away some of my (girl)clothes, and am getting together another box to send out. And as I do, I'm finding things I never wore. Seriously. An elegant black blouse, owned 12 years, worn once. ONCE. I have so much stuff I just piled on, hoping to hit some magic critical mass threshold where I felt okay. 


   I never reached it. 

So now here I am, slowly (SLOWLY!) replacing my work and home clothing with stuff that makes me feel normal. Work will get used to it. I'm not on hormones yet- I've got a five year transition plan, and this isn't the time for that yet. I like not losing my job. Grad school is a good time for that. It feels so strange, because I'm still in drag for work. But it's better, now that I know why it always was weird and awkward and hard work to feel okay. I feel so much better now, so much more happy and alive than I've ever been. 


But it makes me sad, putting these garments away forever, having spent decades of my life and thousands of dollars into trying. TRYING. I feel terrible because I don't know who I am yet, don't know what I like, and have to start figuring that out slowly. I feel sad because I'm letting go of all this effort I put into trying so hard, for so long. It's great because I finally found it, but it's so hard.

Then the doubts: What if I'm wrong? What if in ten years I change my mind somehow? And put myself back in that hell... okay, probably not. But what if? 

This is a tough road. Changing my thoughts is hard- I'm not a girl failure, as I thought for so many years. I'm not a girl at all. Meanwhile I still speak of myself as ""mummie,"" when I'm addressing the cat. Changing my OWN pronouns is hard. 


Anyone out there want to talk about their early transitional times? I don't want to keep these things- they were beautiful but I've never felt they were mine. I'm just sad that I had to live like that so long, and scared by starting over. 

Thanks,
Stopaclock

2012-03-05 19:36:02,qiyh3,12,26,"An Open Letter to my Friends and Family:

It has been a difficult journey to amass enough courage to be true to myself.  It is now my wish to be true to all of you. For as long as I can remember I have held an aspect of myself in deep secrecy. Maintaining such secrecy seemed necessary based on the amount of shame, guilt, and embarrassment I experienced whenever consciously confronting this issue to myself.  But now, as I have started to make strides to alleviate the pain I feel, I want to let everyone I know in on what I plan to do to become a happier person.

I am transsexual.  While this term means many things, the most basic way I can explain my personal situation is that I have always felt I was born into the wrong body.  Over the years this feeling caused emotions that constantly vacillated between confusion, fear, pain, shame, depression, guilt, hopelessness, and helplessness.  The depression it caused is directly responsible for why it has taken me a little longer than usual to complete my undergraduate studies, and also for why I have cut myself off socially from many people to whom this letter is addressed.  

While I am aware that not everyone will be “OK” with this situation, it is nevertheless something that I need everyone to know.  It is impossible to figure out who out of you will be willing to bridge the gap with me across my transition, so I write this prepared that many of you will find it difficult or impossible to accept this news.  I want to stress that it is your right to react in whatever way you choose, but I also want to make it clear to those who support my decision that I want to remain close and to reconnect with those of you with whom I have unfortunately fell out of touch over the past few years.

I also want to make it known that I don’t want anyone to hesitate to ask me questions about what this all means, as I’m sure there are many.  Please don’t be inhibited out of fear of hurting my feelings; I want everyone to understand this as much as possible. The best way to learn is to ask me what comes to your mind, however inconsequential it may seem in the grand scheme of things.

One last thing I want to strongly emphasize is that while my transition will change my appearance and how I’m perceived in society, it will do nothing to change who I am internally.  Believe it or not, mentally, I have always been this person. What I am doing now is merely making my physical body more congruent with my mental identity.  Since I am and continue to be the same person, I want to make it clear that the person you know or knew once is not/was not a fabrication.  The interests, likes/dislikes, personality, sense of humor (or lack thereof), and passions that you have come to identify with my personality remain unchanged.  While this may be a lofty goal, I don’t want the news I just broke to be something that changes your entire perception of me, but rather something that tells you more completely who I am.

2012-03-07 07:50:43,qlhfd,13,13,"Hello, all. I am the cisgendered girlfriend of a fabulous trans girl whom I love more than anything in the world.

Last month, she started taking Medroxyprogesterone, also known as Provera. She has been on her other HRT stuff (estradiol and spironolactone) for almost a year now. We both hoped that Provera would help not only with her development (boobies!!!!), but also with her sex drive.

Going into it, we both knew that there was a possibility of the pills screwing with her head. We were warned, but we decided to give it a try.

Well... she did grow a bit, but I'm not really sure how different it was from the growth rate with the other hormones.

But that's not why I'm writing this.

She was getting depressed. Things that normally would have annoyed her or made her frustrated launched her into a massive funk. She cried more often, had worse ""bad mirror days,"" and worried more that I was going to leave her.

I was so worried about her. I felt awful that I couldn't seem to do anything to help. My efforts to console her were... just kinda useless. I kept saying the wrong things and making things worse.

When I brought up the new meds, and suggested that they were possibly (definitely) amplifying her emotions, she interpreted that as me belittling her feelings. She insisted that she would be feeling exactly what she was feeling, regardless of the meds she was on. She was horrified at the thought of me blaming every action and feeling of hers on Provera. It got to the point where I couldn't even talk about how much stress I was going through because of all this, because we would just go back into the same circular argument/discussion.

It got to a point eventually, after things got worse (sparing the details here, but it's kinda personal), where she finally decided to stop taking Provera. I felt so relieved.... It was SO hard to watch her going through all that, and to not even be able to talk to her about it with her denying the pills' effect.

It's only been a few days, but she's already doing so much better. Her eyes sparkle again. She's more confident in herself. She's so beautiful.

Please, if you're considering Provera, pleasepleaseplease keep this in mind. Be aware of the possible effects, write out a card/contract saying ""In case of crazy, stop taking pills"" or something to that effect. Tell someone who loves you, and who knows you really well, to let you know if you're starting to get irrational. And trust them if they say so.

I don't want anyone to have to go through this. It sucked a lot.

Can trans people feel good about being trans, since it is defined by an unhappiness with one's assigned gender/sex at birth?

A gay person doesn't feel bad about liking other men unless they've been taught to feel that way through societal pressure.

Is it right to assume that a transgender person would feel discontented with their gender/sex regardless of societal pressures?

^Article addresses this (edit)

Is it also correct to assume that transgender people never stop being transgender? Even after you transition (if you choose to do so), you still won't meet societies definition of male nor female. Would it help if society thought of gender and sex as more fluid and delineated?

About three years ago I started working at a grill on campus (my first job), and the first night I worked there I was working with a guy named Jay. He showed me the ropes and I worked a lot of shifts with him, he would talk about girls he would flirt with etc. And at the same time I started noticing that he knew/hung out with a lot of the LGBT community on campus (which I thought was weird, because he was a straight guy).

Fast forward to about a year ago when Jay has long since quit/graduated and I've kind of last track of him. One day my boss makes some remark about how all the women he hires turn out to be lesbians (at the time of the 4 women working for him 3 of us were lesbians[the other two were dating]). And he brings up this girl ""Megan"" and how she was a lesbian but then she started to transition and started being called ""Jay"".

*shock*

Everything kind of clicked (why Jay was always hanging out at the Pride Center and with the LGBT crowd and whatnot). 

At first I was super shocked and felt bad because I didn't know and thought maybe I accidentally did something that I shouldn't have done, after all I met him right when I was coming out and was kind of new to the whole LGBT community.

Then I realized that maybe not knowing that he wasn't cis-male (I hope that's the correct terminology) was the best thing I could have done because it meant I always used the preferred pro-nouns etc.

I've just been feeling like I should maybe leave this here, sorry it's a little long and maybe not too well written.

Thoughts, feelings, advice, anything?

And he brings up this girl ""Megan"" and how she was a lesbian but then she started to transition and started being called ""Jay"".\n\n*shock*\n\nEverything kind of clicked (why Jay was always hanging out at the Pride Center and with the LGBT crowd and whatnot). \n\nAt first I was super shocked and felt bad because I didn\'t know and thought maybe I accidentally did something that I shouldn\'t have done, after all I met him right when I was coming out and was kind of new to the whole LGBT community.\n\nThen I realized that maybe not knowing that he wasn\'t cis-male (I hope that\'s the correct terminology) was the best thing I could have done because it meant I always used the preferred pro-nouns etc.\n\nI\'ve just been feeling like I should maybe leave this here, sorry it\'s a little long and maybe not too well written.\n\nThoughts, feelings, advice, anything?\n\nTL;DR: I used to work with someone who I assumed was cis-male and later found out they were FTM.', 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': ""I'll just leave this here..."", 'created': 1331542067.0}"

I am asking on behalf of my fiancé since he has no idea how to work the internet (he’s 22). Currently, he has been on hormones for around 3.5 years, has changed his name on his driver’s license and social security card, and has had no surgeries. He plans to have top surgery once we raise the funds; unfortunately, as I will work in the nonprofit industry and he is a teacher in a low economic area, we don’t think this will be a possibility for quite a while.

Since our engagement, we have been looking into the ways to change sex on a birth certificate. When he checked a few years ago, he needed to have at least one surgery, a name change, and hormones. Well, something changed in 2009 and now you need a “Court Order” which we cannot seem to find a simple explanation of or a guide to lead us through the process.

2012-03-14 04:11:06,qvp1x,22,83,"In January, I made the decision to finally start my transition. My daughter is about two months away from her sixth birthday and I've been trying to figure out the best way to explain to her what will be happening to her daddy. I was quite anxious about it because she is very aware of the social norms regarding gender from such *wonderful* media outlets like Disney. Anyway, the other night I was feeling very confident and decided to start dropping little hints at things. A month ago when I came out to my family, my mother suggested to my daughter that she should paint my nails. Of course, like any child who's been culturally conditioned about gender, she thought the idea of her daddy with painted nails was hilarious, which was a great opportunity to critically ask her why she thought that a boy with painted nails was funny. She though about it but couldn't come up with an answer, she just ""knew"" it was supposed to be funny. So she painted my nails, and I painted hers and then we played with her barbies and doll house and that was that for then. 

Move forward to a week ago when I was getting her around for bed. We finished up bed time stories and I was tucking her in and decided to be blunt with her, I didn't quite know how it would go, but I know she's extremely intelligent and even more socially aware. So I say 

""&lt;Daughter's Name&gt;, I want to be a girl."" 

Those words exactly. Her reaction was not what I expected. She perked up and got a excited look on her face. 

""Are you going to wear girl clothes?"" she asked.

""Yes."" I replied.

""And pretty dresses like me.""

""Yes, maybe sometimes."" I said.

She thought about it for a second and I will never forget what she said next.

""You are going to be so pretty.""

My heart nearly leaped out of my chest and I couldn't help but tear up a little bit. I gave her a big hug and told her how much I love her and that she meant the world to me and I would always be there for her no matter what. 
Anyway, I thought I'd share. For a while I was going to attempt to avoid transitioning because of her, because I wasn't sure how it would affect her. But now I realize that my daughter loves me, I love her, and nothing in the world can change that.

**tl;dr** I told my five year old daughter that I wanted to be a girl and she gave me one of the most heart warming compliments I've ever received.

2012-03-14 17:10:42,qwect,0,7,"I am an MtF transsexual, and for a long time, I've been looking for a window through which I could tell my own story, but it just felt like it was too common, too easy, too pointless to be worth telling anyone. But then, I had a very affirming thought..

My story *IS* common; so common that even those of us who have similar experiences almost never seem to realize the significance.

I was born into a world obsessed with technology. When I was born, we were on the verge of the internet. Quite a few kids had gaming systems, the rest had an almost constant stream of television and/or movies, and soon we would all have our own computers. Even in those days, I was aware of what I was. 

I remember how excited I felt when I turned on Mario 2 for the very first time and saw that I could play as Princess Peach. It was such a silly little thing, but getting to be her meant so much to me. Before that I had been Mario, Luigi, Megaman, Link, and a slew of other male characters (plus Samus who I had no idea was female), but I felt no connection with any of them. I didn't want to save princesses, I wanted to be one.

I didn't have a lot of friends, but those I did make tended to be female. We grew up together with similar experiences, reveling in our imaginations together, while almost no adults were watching. I would play the male roles when I needed to, letting the cis girls be the princesses, but when I could, I was just one of the girls.

My entire childhood was that way, I have nothing but happy memories of it. But then, as childhoods tend to do, mine began to end. I was thrown into a moderated world, where children were put into a sifter and the girls were sprinkled onto one side of the playground and the boys were dumped on the other. I wasn't allowed to play that way anymore, I was only allowed to be friends with the boys, I had to play with imaginary guns, trucks, and a bunch of turtles who somehow had become ninjas. I couldn't be a princess anymore; if I were, I would be ridiculed for it.

So, I continued on, grew up, and became more and more displaced. Going into puberty, I was disgusted with myself and what was happening to me. I was quiet, completely disconnected, and by that time, had no friends whatsoever. I was completely ridiculed by other kids on a regular basis, which was easy to do because I *never* filled the roles they expected me to. My grades dropped off to nothing, I shut down, and completely stopped caring about myself. I wasn't even a teenager yet and I was already waiting to die.

My mom, who thankfully was perceptive enough to notice what was happening to me (though she had no idea the actual cause) pulled me out of school. I was lucky enough to be home-schooled through most of Jr. High/High School. It was during that time I was home-schooled that the internet boom happened, and all of our lives were changed forever, but perhaps none more than my own. I had a space where I could, finally, be myself again. I think I was only online for about a week before I began creating a female persona and presenting myself as one across the entire internet. I barely ever existed on the internet as anything at all but female.

I still struggled with it, mostly internally, because the voices of my moderated development were still screaming at me to be male, but I continually rejected them. I pushed through, continued to develop my persona, and made so many friends again. My friends only existed digitally to me, as did I to them, and not one ever knew what I really was or treated me any differently than a real girl. It was perfect, I had never been so content.

Eventually I went back to school, but by then most everyone had grown up. Our socializations had sunk in so well, and everyone just became so busy and found so many other things to worry about that no one openly ridiculed anyone anymore, but the split was still there; it was still just as hard to have female friends. I fell in with the nerds, the largely male, yet generally gender-neutral social rejects. I got into reading and writing, D&amp;D, anime, etc. I was male with those friends, but carried on with my female life online, where I would dump all of my day's experiences (pre-facebook/twitter even) and bring my female persona to life. My real life became a feeding tube for my internet life. It was odd, and a lot like living a life for someone else, but it kept me feeling alive.

The internet continued to develop, so did I, and eventually I met someone who would change everything. She quickly became my best friend, and eventually the love of my life. At first, she thought I was male, but when I recognized how in love we were, I couldn't keep my double-life a secret. When I told her the truth, she taught me the single most important thing I've ever learned: It's okay to be what I am. 

As she accepted and even lifted me up, I began to accept myself, and my two lives finally began to finally merge into one. I became happy, I was finally able to start being myself with someone. And from there, I grew. I told all of my friends, most of whom accepted me; I told my family, who had a little trouble at first, but then began to understand what they had been seeing my entire life and how this had affected me, and they accepted me too.

Today, no one needs to know at all that I ever led a double-life. I am the woman I was always meant to be. My body, mind, and soul are, for the first time in my life, completely united.

I'm a fairly typical modern-day transsexual. Looking back on my life, I recognize that it was easy. Apart from a few teachers and a handful of cruel kids, I never had any real hardships that existed outside of my own mind and body. 

So, my story might not be that interesting, but there is something very significant I've found in it. I, like a vast majority of transsexuals, was socialized to be female from the very beginning. Outside of narrow-minded moderated societal influence based entirely on who had a penis and who had a vagina in elementary school, which I rejected as completely as I could, there was a vast, open, technological world that I clung to, which lifted me above that tiny filtered elementary school world.

I am far from an anthropological expert, I only have my own experiences and perceptions, but I believe that with a little bit of study, we transsexuals are going to one day prove conclusively what feminists have been pushing for for decades. **TL;DR: Sex (the body) and gender (the socialized mind) are completely separate entities.**",transgender,How I Became Me: The Story of One Woman's Socialization [x-post from r/lgbt],1331770242.0,"{'created_utc': 1331745042, 'id': 'qwect', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 7, 'selftext': ""I am an MtF transsexual, and for a long time, I've been looking for a window through which I could tell my own story, but it just felt like it was too common, too easy, too pointless to be worth telling anyone.

         Finally a Swedish court has declared forced sterilsation of trans* 
persons wishing to change their legal gender against the law. This means 
that when the proposal for the reformed law on legal gender recognition in 
Sweden is up for debate on June 11th 2012 - two of the three requirements 
in the present law from 1972 have been done away with, divorce and 
sterilisation. Still the condition to be Swedish citizin and the age limit 
for legal gender recogition of 18 years of age remain.

In the Governments proposal for changes in the law will also remove the 
first requirement that concerning citizenship but will keep the age limit. 
This will however be discussed further.

Well known Swedish transactivist has made a summary of this decision in 
English and there are two links to Swedish articles.

2012-03-18 17:32:57,r279l,4,25,"Now, I have a biological mother and later in my life i had a foster mother of sorts. I haven't told my foster mom because she's more conservative (and truthfully, I care more about her reaction, because she's never given me reason to cry on a therapist.) My biomum, on the other hand, can render me suicidally depressed in a five minute phone call if she chooses. 

Been working on that, both of us. She called me a few days back and I finally worked up the nerve to call her back. We talked, and we do talk about how I'm in therapy, she's sorry about my hellish childhood and I understand that and am working through the pain. We try hard not to torture each other these days. So I tell her that I love her but find it hard to talk, etc. 

And I told her what's up in my life- work, school, etc. And towards the end of the call, I finally throw it out there: ""Hey. So... I'm trans. And I went to my first support group last week."" 

Long silence. 


""... um... ah... Well...How was it?"" 

""IT WAS WONDERFUL."" 


She said, ""I can't say this is a total shock."" 

""Yeah, I know. My friends weren't surprised, either."" And we talked about how I'm not going to transition for a few years, to give myself more time to find a job where it would be acceptable, and to give myself time to sort the mental sie out before the physical. She was relatively accepting, at least, it was very clear that while she didn't know what it's like, she accepts that this is both real and permanent, not a phase or a sickness. She also expressed a wish to be supportive, so I should keep in touch as I grow and change. 

I still got off the call in tears, because it IS hard to talk to someone who let my childhood be ruled by abusive bastards she brought home. I mean, she really ruined a large part of my life, and while therapy's helping, I don't talk to her often by choice. But as long as I was going to, I wanted her to be talking to really me. 


My foster mother, I'm going to wait to tell. I have to, because it has to be in person, and I'm going to let her watch me as I change out my clothes and get more comfortable, and then I'm going to try the, ""you know, sometimes the brain doesn't match..."" tactic. 


But hey. One down. And everything went better than expected. I'm now going to be her token trans child (she did this when I was bi- this is my daughter SHE'S GAY) and she got to be the publicly supportive mom. Which is part of why I dreaded telling her. But at least now she knows and I don't have to pretend. She'll tell the rest- my stepfather, my brothers (whom I don't really speak to.) Since we're so not a close family, I'm not worried about that. 


It actually feels weird. Freeing, but at the same time, I was reluctant to share something that means this much. I'm glad it's out but I'm afraid it's all I'll get to talk about for awhile.

Thank you for being here. If you weren't, I never would have gotten this far. I've found more courage and comraderie here than I have anywhere else, and I'm so grateful. You may not know it, but you were there for me when I talked to her. And it helped.

My biomum, on the other hand, can render me suicidally depressed in a five minute phone call if she chooses. \n\nBeen working on that, both of us. She called me a few days back and I finally worked up the nerve to call her back. We talked, and we do talk about how I\'m in therapy, she\'s sorry about my hellish childhood and I understand that and am working through the pain. We try hard not to torture each other these days. So I tell her that I love her but find it hard to talk, etc. \n\nAnd I told her what\'s up in my life- work, school, etc. And towards the end of the call, I finally throw it out there: ""Hey. So... I\'m trans. And I went to my first support group last week."" \n\nLong silence. \n\n\n""... um... ah... Well...How was it?"" \n\n""IT WAS WONDERFUL."" \n\n\nShe said, ""I can\'t say this is a total shock."" \n\n""Yeah, I know. My friends weren\'t surprised, either."" And we talked about how I\'m not going to transition for a few years, to give myself more time to find a job where it would be acceptable, and to give myself time to sort the mental sie out before the physical. She was relatively accepting, at least, it was very clear that while she didn\'t know what it\'s like, she accepts that this is both real and permanent, not a phase or a sickness. She also expressed a wish to be supportive, so I should keep in touch as I grow and change. \n\nI still got off the call in tears, because it IS hard to talk to someone who let my childhood be ruled by abusive bastards she brought home. I mean, she really ruined a large part of my life, and while therapy\'s helping, I don\'t talk to her often by choice. But as long as I was going to, I wanted her to be talking to really me. \n\n\nMy foster mother, I\'m going to wait to tell. I have to, because it has to be in person, and I\'m going to let her watch me as I change out my clothes and get more comfortable, and then I\'m going to try the, ""you know, sometimes the brain doesn\'t match..."" tactic. \n\n\nBut hey. One down. And everything went better than expected. I\'m now going to be her token trans child (she did this when I was bi- this is my daughter SHE\'S GAY) and she got to be the publicly supportive mom. Which is part of why I dreaded telling her. But at least now she knows and I don\'t have to pretend. She\'ll tell the rest- my stepfather, my brothers (whom I don\'t really speak to.) Since we\'re so not a close family, I\'m not worried about that. \n\n\nIt actually feels weird. Freeing, but at the same time, I was reluctant to share something that means this much. I\'m glad it\'s out but I\'m afraid it\'s all I\'ll get to talk about for awhile.\n\nThank you for being here. If you weren\'t, I never would have gotten this far. I\'ve found more courage and comraderie here than I have anywhere else, and I\'m so grateful. You may not know it, but you were there for me when I talked to her. And it helped.

2012-03-19 04:34:46,r315g,4,21,"While I've always been a girl, even before I really realized it, I have only announced openly the fact that -- despite being born male -- I am one only about a year ago. Just over a year, actually. I know how to count my blessings and do so quite frequently when I realize that I was never very masculine in form or function, or when I think about the fact that nobody thus far has disowned me (that I know of) for my announcement. It's been difficult and I know it takes time to adjust, but sometimes I feel like people aren't ""getting it."" The thing that most frequently causes this particular feeling is pronouns. 

Ahh, pronouns. . . tricky little words that mean so little but convey so much information. This is even more true in this day and age where everyone and everything thinks that the dividing line is gender despite the fact that very few people really understand the concept of gender. It is such an abstract thought; so complex, so varying, and so wide-reaching. People never seem to understand that being male doesn't really mean you necessarily like football or drink beer, and being female doesn't always mean you don't like those things. Never in my life have I ever met any group of men or women who were equally divided as the ""gender binary"" would leave us to believe they are. Because of this, it is disturbing to me to find the amount of information, and more so the amount of false information, that a pronoun conveys. When you say ""she"" or ""he"" you are, perhaps unintentionally, pigeon-holing a person into a mold that no human being really fits in. 

It is unfortunate however that pronouns are so necessary to the flow of conversation. Human interaction needs to be brief in most cases and so a single syllable word to describe the subject of a conversation is, of course, required. Sure, you could use gender-neutral pronouns, but too many people are unfamiliar with them, and will only wrinkle their nose and furrow their brow when you say ""Zie went to the store,"" or ""I will call hir later."" And so, gender specific pronouns will not find their way to the exit door (as they need to) for quite some time, assuming they ever do. Having said that, I don't think anyone really doubts the importance of pronouns; nor does anyone really question the importance of choosing the proper pronouns for a person. This may seem very obvious, but for people who do not conform to the gender binary, and people who find themselves with incongruent sex and gender, this is a major point of contingency. A male-bodied woman cannot help but lack certain feminine gender cues sometimes and relies on those close to her to convey her correct gender to those around her. A female-bodied butch who may appear masculine but still identify solely as female also relies on those around her to use the proper pronouns as part of her kit of gender cues. 

Misgendering through pronouns is a painful thing. Nobody wants to call someone out by correcting their use of improper pronouns, but what else can one do? We can wait until a later time and try to correct the (wrong) impression of being the opposite gender, but that can be painful. You only get one chance for first impressions and it is infinitely hurtful when you misgender me to someone I'm meeting for the first time. As I said, it has been over a year now. People have had enough time to adjust at least enough to realize that it is as hurtful to me to refer to me as ""he"" as it would be to any woman you know (female-bodied or not) to do the same; as hurtful as calling any man you know ""she."" This is why it surprises me to see so little effort put into this one thing. We all know and agree on the importance of pronouns, and the severe effect they have on one's perception of a person, and yet most people I know are still so careless about it. 

What is worse is how I feel unentitled to correct people. I have always felt it wrong to inflict any amount of work on others due to my personal problem. Being born with the wrong sex attached is certainly not my fault, but it's not anyone else's either; so I feel it would be wrong to correct someone. However, if I were female-bodied as well as female-gendered I would be well within my right to raise a fuss about misgendering. This leaves me conflicted and ultimately trapped. ""Eventually it will alll work itself out,"" I keep telling myself, but I am starting to doubt that. Regardless, I hope you will think before you use pronouns.

2012-03-22 04:07:34,r7wib,0,2,"""I’m aware that I haven’t really mentioned anything to you in the months since I initially came out to you, but that has to change. You may have assumed it became less of an issue, but my  gender dysphoria (sense of discomfort in one’s assigned gender) isn’t ‘gone’ by any stretch of the imagination, and in fact continues to grow. 

 I really hadn’t been open about it because of what I perceived as small jabs against me. Asking if I wanted to bring any of my ‘Funky clothes’ to Auburn was probably the most major of those. This makes a few implications that disappoint me.

 This is why I’ve largely avoided discussions with you involving this topic, and even now I am hesitant to do so. It feels awkward, for many reasons, but it’s not something I can continue to stand around and ignore.

I realize that in my previous letter to you I made some basic assumptions and was generally very vague, so I’ll rephrase my situation again, and go over basic implications of some things. I am not certain how much you know, so this is possibly a refresher

I do not see myself as male, instead seeing myself closer to the female side of the gender spectrum.  This has no bearing on sexual orientation, or even method of expression. There are MTF ‘butch’ people just as there are FTM ‘twinks’.  Many transsexual(as opposed to transgendered, which is an umbrella term for anybody that crosses the gender barrier in some way, whether they be transsexual, intersexed, bigender, agender, transvestite, etc.) people do not undergo what is considered by many to be THE surgery, a ‘sex change’. This is far from the only option available, and many do not ever take this step. The FtM crowd in particular tends to avoid it, as the surgery for them is drastically incomplete, but that’s not my focus now. 

 A variety of ‘treatments’ exist to transition, or go from one side of the gender spectrum to the other. Many outside the transgender community don’t really understand these steps so I’ll go over this.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Transition for the MTF (male to female):
-Therapy, required to get a letter of recommendation to an endocrinologist, who deals with hormones. Therapists usually follow the Harry Benjamin Standards of Care, which address ethical 	implications of the transitioning process.
-Anti-Androgens, these either block testosterone from being produced, or prevent the body from utilizing it. These are usually prescribed for a time before Estrogen is begun. These have minimal visable effects on their own. These cannot be used without ‘E’ for a long time, as the absence of 	a sex hormone does bring some medical risks.
-Estrogen: the most important hormone for a MTF. This brings visible feminizing effects over a period of months and even years. This treatment occurs for life, though after orchiectomy (removal of the 	testes) or SRS (sex reassignment surgery or a ‘sex change’) the dosage may be reduced. There are medical risks associated with this, including liver problems and cancer risks. Blood clots are 	another serious concern. Regular checkups for blood work are necessary, as with proper supervision any problems can be addressed before they become dangerous. A trusted doctor is necessary at this point; some do without a doctor and risk severe medical problems.
-Laser Hair Removal or Electrolysis. These are necessary to stop male hair from being evident. Hormones do not eliminate this on their own, though they may reduce the density and color of the hair 	that is present.
-Voice Training, No hormones exist to feminize a voice. This must be accomplished through similar techniques that actors and singers undergo to alter their methods of speaking.
-Body Language: Body language may change through practice, training, or natural shifting of the distribution of muscles and body fat.
-Legal implications: Legal name changes, driver’s licenses, birth certificates, passports, and the like all need to be changed. Some require certain other steps to take place before they can be changed.
-Orchi or SRS: Many who do not undergo SRS opt to have an orchi. Either way, natural testosterone is 	not produced and HRT must be continued for life. If the testes are still present Anti-androgens must be used and medical risks are higher. Stopping HRT with the testes present causes many, but not all, secondary sexual characteristics to revert. If SRS is done there are a variety of other 	steps, though they really aren’t ‘appropriate’ for a letter like this one. Needless to say it’s a bit 	graphic and unnecessary at this point.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I’m bringing all this up because I want to get the ball rolling.  I have done the research and I believe this is what I need. I hope to begin transition soon, as it rapidly loses effectiveness after puberty. Those who transition young have a good chance of ‘passing’ as a genetic member of the sex they wish to present as. College is a good time to do this for a variety of reasons, and Auburn has a small transgender community that I’ve already made friends in. My immediate goal for the future is the first step of transition, therapy. A long term goal of mine is living full time as a female. I do not currently plan on having SRS, though this may be a possibility in the future. This is a long, extensive (and honestly expensive) process.  I know I wasn’t this straightforward with you during my last letter, but this is what I need. I’ve felt this way for years, and it’s time to finally do something about it.


You may be put off by the social stigma, the adverse medical effects, or the costs, but really this is something that has to happen. Time after time, people have tried to repress this, only to finally feel the need to transition long after it is a feasible idea. It cannot ‘wait a few years’ as every day that goes by Testosterone RUINS the body a bit more. The suicide rate among pre transition transsexuals is over 35%, and the attempts are over 50%. Dysphoria is something that grows over time, and though I have not reached these lowest of stages, I know it is coming. This is why I want to transition. This is why I have to transition. I need your help with this.
Many terms I used may be unfamiliar to you, and I encourage you to ask me more. There are probably other complexities I didn’t mention that are relevant that I simply missed. Ask me, and I’ll try to answer you to the best of my ability. If I don’t know, I know how to get you that answer. There are a myriad of small things and basic assumptions that the cisgendered (not transgendered) majority make that makes the trans community uncomfortable. I see you make them on occasion, and it hurts. I know its not malicious however, and so I can forgive it. I do ask that you try to understand me, and people like me. I know it’s different, and I know it’s asking a lot to ask you to accept all this unconditionally. I simply ask that you try.

I love you.""


I have yet to send this letter. Just looking for feedback. Is there anything in here I could improve before sending it? I really want to convey basic info as well as express my feelings, as I'm not really sure how much the 'average' cisperson knows about transition besides something vague about chopping off your penis. I'm 17, and as such am dependent on my mother for helping me through transition. Its not something I can do solely on my own.

2012-03-22 04:17:26,r7ww5,21,32,"Hey all, I am sitting around just waiting so here goes...

I will be getting facial surgery at 7am on March 22nd. It is 8pm Wednesday right now. I am in Phoenix Arizona, and will be doing it with Toby Meltzer. 

It is an 8-10 hour surgery, and will cost $30,000. (Meltzer is expensive.)

Work I will be getting...
Forehead:
Flatten out the brow bone,
Raise the eyebrows slightly,
Bring the hairline forward about half an inch,
Nose:
Shrink the nose's width by 35%,
Add a slight concave curve to the slope,
Make the tip of the nose point upward,
Cheeks:
Some thin silicon gel cheek implants.

And to finish it all off, a good ol' face lift. (Which is unneeded, since I am only 25, but as long as they have me open they might as well I guess.)

I paid for it by getting $15,000 in cash and $15,000 in loans. My parents refused to help pay but WERE willing to help with the loan part. So with their credit aiding me I got a 0% interest loan that I will pay for over the next year or so.

I think if you plan to get facial surgery in just one area (Say nose or chin job) you can probably go to any regular plastic surgeon. I'd only suggest going to a transgender-specialized surgeon if you are doing 4-5 or more things because in that case you'll want someone who is experienced with knowing how the whole finished face will look when they're midway through surgery. The nice thing about being able to go to a regular plastic surgeon, or one in Thailand, is you'll usually end up paying half what you would have to pay with someone like Meltzer. 

Here are some before images: http://imgur.com/a/soB2o#1

But do note, a lot of that is good lighting/makeup. I should probably throw up some ""uglier"" pics but this is reddit and I don't want moonflower or Aspel finding them and posting them elsewhere. :p

You'll just have to trust me that I have a big neanderthal browbone that my glasses help cover up. (Yes I know I ""pass,"" and don't ""need"" this surgery, but I don't want to merely pass. I want to pass *and* look good. I consider it an investment, and I place it as higher priority than bottom surgery.)

So now I'm just waiting. No food for the next 12 hours, just sitting around at home, posting on reddit.

Edit: It is now Friday about 48 hours after my initial post, and 36 hours after surgery. The first 24 hours after surgery sucked! You feel like your nose/throat is filled with mucus but every time you sneeze it's just big globs of blood! LoL. I am pretty dazed right now, so I won't be posting anything in depth. My face looks like ""Android 19"" from DragonballZ right now (Look it up on google images if you don't know it), except with my normal skin color and stitches across my hairline.

(Which is unneeded, since I am only 25, but as long as they have me open they might as well I guess.)\n\nI paid for it by getting $15,000 in cash and $15,000 in loans. My parents refused to help pay but WERE willing to help with the loan part. So with their credit aiding me I got a 0% interest loan that I will pay for over the next year or so.\n\nI think if you plan to get facial surgery in just one area (Say nose or chin job) you can probably go to any regular plastic surgeon. I\'d only suggest going to a transgender-specialized surgeon if you are doing 4-5 or more things because in that case you\'ll want someone who is experienced with knowing how the whole finished face will look when they\'re midway through surgery. The nice thing about being able to go to a regular plastic surgeon, or one in Thailand, is you\'ll usually end up paying half what you would have to pay with someone like Meltzer. \n\nHere are some before images: http://imgur.com/a/soB2o#1\n\nBut do note, a lot of that is good lighting/makeup. I should probably throw up some ""uglier"" pics but this is reddit and I don\'t want moonflower or Aspel finding them and posting them elsewhere. :p\n\nYou\'ll just have to trust me that I have a big neanderthal browbone that my glasses help cover up. (Yes I know I ""pass,"" and don\'t ""need"" this surgery, but I don\'t want to merely pass. I want to pass *and* look good. I consider it an investment, and I place it as higher priority than bottom surgery.)\n\nSo now I\'m just waiting. No food for the next 12 hours, just sitting around at home, posting on reddit.\n\nEdit: It is now Friday about 48 hours after my initial post, and 36 hours after surgery. The first 24 hours after surgery sucked! You feel like your nose/throat is filled with mucus but every time you sneeze it\'s just big globs of blood! LoL. I am pretty dazed right now, so I won\'t be posting anything in depth. My face looks like ""Android 19"" from DragonballZ right now (Look it up on google images if you don\'t know it), except with my normal skin color and stitches across my hairline. My skin is soo puffy/stretched! Yikes... Well, I will post pictures when I look better.
