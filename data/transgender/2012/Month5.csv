2012-05-15 23:14:19,tp0t2,40,30,"This post has been brewing for a while, and maybe now is not the right time to say it, but there really is never a right time I suppose. This is not a post written 'ex cathedra', rather from a somewhat disjointed 12 years of transition and post-op life. Call them random pieces of fluff in the ether, or maybe the spoils of a life lived on the cusp of my sleeve, but I wanted to add my two pence to the overall metaconversation that has been running through this sub-reddit over the last year or so.

First off, life does not get better, or worse, when you take the leap and transition. On the one hand you leave all those burdens behind, and that is one of the greatest weights you will ever let go of; rather, you inherit a whole new set of quandaries that come with the variance you now present to the world. This in turn leads you to having to make some fairly radical compromises in your life: namely do you wish to pass in a mainstream sense, be true to thine own self, or muddle your way through it. Before anyone accuses me of trying to judge anyone on how they should live their lives let me make it clear that the closer to the mainstream you sale, the easier your life will be, regardless of whether you are gender variant or not. End of discussion. This is not a debate, but an objective fact of humanity. Those of us who choose to meander in and out of the mainstream (which is probably where I have been tacking for the last decade or so) have far simpler and relatively hassle free lives. This really should be teaching you to suck eggs, and many of you will dismiss this point as mere phobia of the other, but I prefer to see it as pragmatism in the face of wanting a comfortable life. All-in-all this has lead me to conclude that the base rule of life in general, and transition as a whole, is to find the space you are comfortable with, and live your life as content as you are able. If you are happy drawing attention to yourself then that is awesome, but if you are someone who is not able to handle the scrutiny that alternative lifestyles bring, then tacking closer to the mainstream is a far more honest and sensible approach.

Which leads me onto my second point. Transition does not stop at any point until you either die or revert back to your prior gender. This is another dirty point that no-one faces up to. At no point will you ever be able to hide (though many of us would love to) the fact that you have a past, and unless you literally cut yourself off from all your previous friends, family, and life, then there will always be the lingering threads that you will never be able to sever. This does not have to be an issue, in fact it is something you will have to find peace with if you are ever to move forward. The fact that you have experience life as both genders is not something to be ashamed or shy of, though personally I am a wee bit reticent of divulging too much information about my prior gender as it is more of an echo now. You will find yourself reminiscing and wondering about a life you could have had if the dysphoria had never been there, and this is not something to worry about or fear, it is a natural part of the process. I catch myself sometimes wondering about a life that was not lived, and know that the life I have now is the one I am glad I have. Being the woman I am now is probably the best decision I have ever made, and there are no regrets in my heart at all over the path I have chosen.

My third point is that this whole process is a choice. This is probably the most egregious one that I will state, but I make no bones about it: you have a choice about whether you transition or not. I know many of you will shoot me down for saying this, and in many ways it appears hypocritical of me to say it given the age and time I transitioned, but it has to be said. Not everyone should transition who is gender dysphoric, as the quality of life you will lead post-transition will be immeasurably less than what you have at the moment. This path is not for the faint of heart, and if you are giving up so much to tread it, then you should consider it very, very carefully. It is easy for those of us on the other side to hold out an inviting hand and say ""jump"", but in the end if the life you jump into is not much of a life at all, then was it worth it in the first place? You have to ignore the naysayers and the cheer leaders, and objectively weigh up all considerations before deciding to transition. It is not as simple as saying ""I am trapped therefore I must free myself"". This is a fallacy of the highest order, because if you enter your transition from this perspective then you will often walk into a whole world of trouble. A far better mind set to have is to open your eyes to the holistic reality of what you are about to undertake, and if you can genuinely say that this is the right path for you, and you accept ALL the consequences and unknowns that will be thrown your way, then you will find the peace and tranquility of self that transition can bring.

My final point is thus - this is very much a shades of grey discussion, and one which I personally think should be framed in the following terms: 
To transition should not be seen as the only solution to gender dysphoria, as there are people who find themselves out of their depths with no choice but to continue down a path that does not suit their needs. Rather, a more dynamic approach is needed, both from within the trans community and the medical professionals who aid in the process. Rather than a simple transition/don't transition approach, especially where it is clear that the quality of life for the transitioner will be irrevocably degraded, a more holistic and pragmatic approach needs to be advocated; namely those who will not have a good quality of life should be encouraged, gently, to seek other options. What those options are is up for debate, and before some-one leaves an angry comment that often the only choice is suicide or death I will make it very clear that I have never, ever believed this to be the case (I have gone through a suicide attempt myself so please don't call me out on this one). Rather, I believe that this is precisely the wrong time to transition, as the persons expectations will built up too high, and the resulting emotional crash that inevitably happens post transition will be hard indeed. It is better for people in this situation to receive appropriate psychiatric help, and transition once the underlying issues have been resolves, as hormones will amplify any residual issues lingering in the background (again this is from both personal experience and witnessing friends and partners go through the same).

Life is not a fairy tale, there are no happy endings, just lives lived to their fullest. I am not advocating that anyone should have the right to bar any other from transitioning, or that being gender queer/gender fluid is a bad thing (I personally sail close to the gender fluid line), rather I am arguing that the whole transition bandwagon steamrollers the reality that we live in. 12 years has taught me that there are many success stories out there, and I have many wonderful friends who can attest to this, but at the same time there are also people who I know quite well who have not managed to square the circle of their transition and would have been better off not transitioning in the first place. This post is ultimately to say that when you take that first leap over the line it is better to be in possession of the fullest of facts rather than the cotton candy hope that utopia is just around the corner. I have no regrets from my transition, and have total serenity with my inner and outer person; I have asked myself the very hardest of questions, and each time the answer comes back that I being true to mine own self. My dearest wish is that each of you can say the same, and live your own lives in the knowledge that you are content and happy with your place in the world.

In summation I can joyfully say that I have never been more at ease with myself, nor have I seen more people happy and content with the decisions they have made in their lives in respect of their gender. It can be such a liberating and fulfilling path to walk down, and providing you do so with your eyes wide open, then I am certain you will find it just as life affirming as many of you reading this. Pragmatically it is not a bed of roses, but non-the-less I would not change the fact I am who I am.

I want to say that if any of this upsets you, then please discuss it with me in an open manner, as I am happy to talk about my views. In no way is this meant to be representative of any one other than myself, and hopefully we can all take something away from this.

  Long time mostly lurker here. This is such an awesome community. &lt;3

  I really hope this doesn't come across as disrespectful – if it does, please PLEASE let me know and I will ax it. The last thing I want to do is put anything not positive up here. 

  For the final paper in my Gender and Communication class, our assignment is to come up with a topic related to gender to research. Lots of people are doing how to communicate in romantic relationships, workplace sexual harassment patterns, differences in learning styles between boys and girls, etc, but I wanted to take something that hits a little closer to home for me. I chose to take a look at the ways in which the coming out and transitioning processes are different/similar for MTF and FTM individuals.  

  I've looked into literature, interviews, etc., but this subreddit kept coming to mind, and I thought it'd be pretty awesome to actually hear from people in my own circles. I wondered if anyone would be interested in taking part in a survey? 

  If I've phrased anything poorly, left anything out, or included anything that really shouldn't be there, let me know and I'll be more than happy to make changes. :) Or, like I said, if this shouldn't be here at all – I'll take it right down. You certainly don't have to answer the entire thing, either – if you only feel comfortable answering certain questions, pick and choose as you'd like. Responses will (obviously) be confidential in the context of my paper.

  If you'd care to reply here where it's open for discussion, awesome! If you'd like to pm answers to me, awesome! If you'd prefer to email responses to sussigkeit12 (at) gmail (dot) com, (you guessed it), awesome! 

  With all that said, thanks so much for your help. I'm really interested in hearing your stories. :) 





* What is your gender? (I'm talking about who you are, not what body parts genetics arbitrarily handed out. If you feel like sharing your birth sex in addition, feel free to do so, but no pressure.)

* Age? 

* Who, if anyone, are you out to?   
  
* Who did you first come out to? When? Why?  
  
* If/how did gender dysphoria impact you during childhood and growing up? How did the people in your life respond to it? Family? School? Neighborhood? 
  
* Are you transitioning? If so, what does that entail for you?
  
* What kinds of reactions have you had from family? Friends? The workplace? Strangers?   

* What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced along your journey?   
  
* Who have been your allies? 

* Is there anything else you'd like to add?   



Thanks very much for taking part. You rock!

This is such an awesome community. &lt;3\n\n  I really hope this doesn't come across as disrespectful – if it does, please PLEASE let me know and I will ax it. The last thing I want to do is put anything not positive up here. \n\n  For the final paper in my Gender and Communication class, our assignment is to come up with a topic related to gender to research. Lots of people are doing how to communicate in romantic relationships, workplace sexual harassment patterns, differences in learning styles between boys and girls, etc, but I wanted to take something that hits a little closer to home for me. I chose to take a look at the ways in which the coming out and transitioning processes are different/similar for MTF and FTM individuals.  \n\n  I've looked into literature, interviews, etc., but this subreddit kept coming to mind, and I thought it'd be pretty awesome to actually hear from people in my own circles. I wondered if anyone would be interested in taking part in a survey? \n\n  If I've phrased anything poorly, left anything out, or included anything that really shouldn't be there, let me know and I'll be more than happy to make changes. :) Or, like I said, if this shouldn't be here at all – I'll take it right down. You certainly don't have to answer the entire thing, either – if you only feel comfortable answering certain questions, pick and choose as you'd like. Responses will (obviously) be confidential in the context of my paper.\n\n  If you'd care to reply here where it's open for discussion, awesome! If you'd like to pm answers to me, awesome! If you'd prefer to email responses to sussigkeit12 (at) gmail (dot) com, (you guessed it), awesome! \n\n  With all that said, thanks so much for your help. I'm really interested in hearing your stories. :) \n\n\n\n\n\n* What is your gender? (I'm talking about who you are, not what body parts genetics arbitrarily handed out. If you feel like sharing your birth sex in addition, feel free to do so, but no pressure.)\n\n* Age? \n\n* Who, if anyone, are you out to?   \n  \n* Who did you first come out to? When? Why?  \n  \n* If/how did gender dysphoria impact you during childhood and growing up? How did the people in your life respond to it? Family? School? Neighborhood? \n  \n* Are you transitioning? If so, what does that entail for you?\n  \n* What kinds of reactions have you had from family? Friends? The workplace? Strangers?   \n\n* What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced along your journey?   \n  \n* Who have been your allies? \n\n* Is there anything else you'd like to add?   \n\n\n\nThanks very much for taking part. You rock!\n\n*EDIT: You are all really incredible, thank you for sharing your stories and giving me a hand in the process. Mad respect, you alls.

- ""Banning segregated units and facilities that are based solely on LGBTI status, unless created in coordination with a court order or consent decree. The prohibition will therefore not apply to the gay and transgender unit at the Los Angeles County Jail. This prohibition also will not bar LGBTI-specific units in short-term “lockup” facilities.""
- ""Mandating that decisions about whether inmates will be housed in male or female facilities be made on an individual basis, with the aim of maximizing the safety of the inmate. This will make it easier for trans women to be housed with other women.""
- ""Requiring staff training about how to communicate with and treat LGBTI inmates. ""
- ""Banning searches of transgender inmates just to determine their anatomy.""
- ""Transgender and intersex inmates must be given the opportunity to shower separately from other inmates.""

This is the last video I just uploaded: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85-4O3cr6SM

It's one of those super short and fun ones! Sometimes I click on a video and it's like 15 minutes, and I'm kind of like ughhhh this doesn't have to be that long, so I don't watch it all. That's why I make short videos; but I also have some longer videos with more information, if I feel like there's just no way to get it all out in a short amount of time.

So yeah, check out the video linked above, and then if you like it, check out some more stuff, and subscribe. I want to do a Q&amp;A video soon too, so if you have any questions for me, please leave them here as comments :)

*Hello,
My name is Maxine [Redacted], I was born [Redacted]. And I am a Gender Non-Conforming member of the Jacksonville Community. I was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and Transexualism, and sadly I'm a member of a statistic that says an estimated 40% of people afflicted with this condition will attempt Suicide rather then face the Discrimination of their community. A year ago I put a rifle in my mouth because I no longer could handle the anger and hatred that Dysphoria filled my mind with. Or the idea of facing the discrimination others have faced in our city.

I am only here today because a loved one interupted me and another managed to find me help. I started taking hormones 11 months ago. I have since been classified as Biochemically female by my doctor. And I'm happy. The suicidal thoughts, the anger, the rage they are gone. But the Discrimination is not.

I'm standing in front of you now wearing my mask, The male attire I wear to work due to being afraid of losing my job if I showed up how I felt inside. Because of the awkward glances my coworkers would give me. Sadly this mask will eventually no longer work. My appearance has changed so much in the last year. My body shape no longer even remotely resembles a male body. The effect is I now look like a girl wearing her boyfriends clothes out in public. I'm no longer male. 

But because of discrimination I hide as much of my Gender as I can still. 

Some will say Gender Identity anti-discrimination is about basic human rights - The right to a job, a place to live, and fair treatment in public spaces.  I agree with that. But in reality, it is about having the right to just to feel safe in our community. Without fear of losing our job, our home, or to be turned away from a public area because we fail to Conform. 

I'm transgender and I'm happy that I can say that, but I do not feel safe. 

Please pass Council Bill 2012-296
Thank you.*

Reddit won't let me submit it because someone posted it 11 months ago, but the site has been updated for this year's conference. This will be my third year attending and I'm happy to report that my parents (I'm twenty-three, began physically transitioning ~14 months ago, live with my parents, and lucky to have them support me) actually considered going this year. They even looked at the website!

I'm so excited to go! 

My best memory of the conference was when I went for the first time. It was shortly after I decided to begin living as a male. I wasn't sure how my parents would react to me coming out. So instead of going to the ""how do I come out as trans to my parents"" session, I went to the ""My child is trans/gender non-conforming ...What do I do?"" session. I did this because I knew how I was going to come out to my parents, but I had no idea what they would say, or think, or what questions they might have. 

So I found a seat in the back of the room that was PACKED with parents and I listened to a number of people express fears they had for their children's safety and well-being, and their own insecurities dealing with peer  and societal scrutiny, and worries about how they would be able to best support their children.

A majority of the parents had children between the ages of five and twelve who were identifying as transgender.

I actually shed a few tears of joy because despite how desperate and uncomfortable some of the parents seemed, they loved and supported their children unconditionally and wanted these issues resolved before their children hit puberty and its numerous devastating consequences.

It proved to me that times are changing, parents are changing their views, children are receiving ample support they need at home and the world is becoming a more accepting and tolerant place. 

Different story: The following year a friend invited me to lunch one day during the conference and I ate with him and three of his friends. One of which was a mother who's husband (the word she used) had come out to her two years earlier and had transitioned. Then one of her children came out as trans. Crazy, right?
