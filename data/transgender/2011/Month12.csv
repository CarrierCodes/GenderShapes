2011-12-01 05:24:02,mvs2g,19,71,"Hello all! Today I went out all-girl. I took the bus to my psychiatrist, then went to a queer youth center for a few hours, and then took the bus home.

I have to say, my initial foray outside was frightening. I really was scared, so much so I just kind of looked ahead and kept walking. The more I relaxed, though, the more I realized how incredibly *normal* it felt. I started to smile. By the time I got to the psychiatrist's, I was feeling pretty good. I've been in a cloud of depression lately, and I know this is going to sound cliché, but the colors were *brighter*, and the sounds were *sharper!!*

The appointment went *very* well. Of course I've told him about being transgender, but I've always presented somewhere in-between male and female. Today though, I was Andrea---not even Andy anymore! As we sat down, he slipped a ""Good day sir"" to me, and I was more than happy to say, ""Not sir, Dr. -----!"" Then he looked up and saw me, and he actually smiled. He saw that I was actually happy, pretty much the first time he's seen me like this. We talked about conquering fears, and how normal it felt for me, and he expressed his full support. A few more months, and he should be ready to write an endocrinologist letter!

Now to the things I found most interesting about the experience. A couple months ago I was talking to a transgirl friend of mine, and while discussing bathrooms I had the weird idea that it would somehow be exhilarating to use the girls' room. Today I realized how absolutely stupid that is. ***It just felt normal!*** Just walking around as a girl felt ***so normal!*** I didn't feel as weird about the feminine mannerisms I've been using for so long now, probably in part because I had padded boobs in, styled hair, and respectable makeup on. It wasn't an act at all---it was ***ME***, and it was ***normal.*** :-D

I did get three double-takes; one from a guy asking for a cigarette, and two from random guys next to me on street corners while waiting for the light to change. They weren't even looking at my face, they were glancing absently at my boobs. *sigh* I guess guys just do that, and I'm going to have to get used to it eventually.

Even though I felt safe today, I think it might be wise to invest in some mace (hopefully just for show). But all in all, It was an INCREDIBLE experience just being myself for once! For any of y'all who are still nervous or scared about venturing out as yourself, while I still advise some caution, you won't *believe* the experience once you finally do it.

Thank you for all your support, r/transgender! I hope to stick around here for some time now!

PS. My parents were remarkably cool about it when I got home. We talked for a while, but everything was fine. My mom's even taking me to get my ears pierced this weekend, and hopefully to buy a bra of my own so I don't have to steal hers anymore.

So we have this announcement today. http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/December/11-crt-1560.html

&gt;WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced today that it is opening civil investigations into two state correctional institutions (SCI) in Western Pennsylvania. In accordance with the pattern or practice provision of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), the department will investigate allegations that SCI Pittsburgh failed to adequately protect prisoners from harm, including from prisoner-on-prisoner and officer-on-prisoner violence and sexual violence, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the department will look into whether SCI Pittsburgh **officers systematically targeted prisoners for violence and other abuse based on the prisoners’ race, sexual orientation, gender identity** or other status, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 

Contact information to file complaints, etc, if you have witnessed any sort of this behaviour is on that page. 

This **fairly unusual** federal investigation is related to this http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11265/1176794-100-0.stm

&gt; The complaint also laid out a ""conspiracy to sexually abuse, physically abuse and mentally abuse inmates who were homosexual ... transgender ... [or] who were convicted of sexual crimes.""

&gt; ...

&gt; Another former SCI Pittsburgh inmate, Rodger E. Williams, filed a pro se complaint two months ago, making a slew of complaints about the treatment of transgender inmates like himself at both the Woods Run prison and SCI Greene. Among them: that Mr. Nicoletti raped him, and ""doled [him] out to other corrections officers and a [prison] inmate into forcibly committing sexual acts."" In a recent addendum to the complaint Mr. Williams, 32, wrote that he suffered ""oral and anal rape"" conducted by state corrections officers.
&gt; ...
&gt; In April, news broke that eight guards, including Mr. Nicoletti, had been suspended. Ms. McNaughton would not comment on their status, and leaders of their union could not be reached. In May, four top SCI Pittsburgh officials were replaced. Ms. McNaughton said they are no longer employed by the department.

Whatever was going on in SCI Pittsburgh, it was **really fucked up** and I can guarantee we're going to hear a lot more about this in the coming months. The fact that corrections officers have been suspended for this length of time WITHOUT PAY is highly unusual. 

The previous article is dated in regards to criminal charges, this has some more details, http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_761991.html

&gt; The three former officials also claim that the sexual assault investigation began with Niemiec notifying a security captain that an unusually high number of new inmates were asking for the protection of solitary confinement, the lawsuit says. They spent hours gathering information for investigators and Lockett readily agreed to suspend the eight guards that state investigators identified as participating in or abetting the assaults, the lawsuit says. ""They did everything they could,"" said Farnan.

&gt; **The investigation that has led to nearly 100 charges against guard Harry F.

In accordance with the pattern or practice provision of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), the department will investigate allegations that SCI Pittsburgh failed to adequately protect prisoners from harm, including from prisoner-on-prisoner and officer-on-prisoner violence and sexual violence, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the department will look into whether SCI Pittsburgh **officers systematically targeted prisoners for violence and other abuse based on the prisoners’ race, sexual orientation, gender identity** or other status, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n\nContact information to file complaints, etc, if you have witnessed any sort of this behaviour is on that page. \n\nThis **fairly unusual** federal investigation is related to this http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11265/1176794-100-0.stm\n\n&gt; The complaint also laid out a ""conspiracy to sexually abuse, physically abuse and mentally abuse inmates who were homosexual ... transgender ... [or] who were convicted of sexual crimes.""\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; Another former SCI Pittsburgh inmate, Rodger E. Williams, filed a pro se complaint two months ago, making a slew of complaints about the treatment of transgender inmates like himself at both the Woods Run prison and SCI Greene. Among them: that Mr. Nicoletti raped him, and ""doled [him] out to other corrections officers and a [prison] inmate into forcibly committing sexual acts."" In a recent addendum to the complaint Mr. Williams, 32, wrote that he suffered ""oral and anal rape"" conducted by state corrections officers.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; In April, news broke that eight guards, including Mr. Nicoletti, had been suspended. Ms. McNaughton would not comment on their status, and leaders of their union could not be reached. In May, four top SCI Pittsburgh officials were replaced. Ms. McNaughton said they are no longer employed by the department.\n\nWhatever was going on in SCI Pittsburgh, it was **really fucked up** and I can guarantee we\'re going to hear a lot more about this in the coming months. The fact that corrections officers have been suspended for this length of time WITHOUT PAY is highly unusual. \n\nThe previous article is dated in regards to criminal charges, this has some more details, http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_761991.html\n\n&gt; The three former officials also claim that the sexual assault investigation began with Niemiec notifying a security captain that an unusually high number of new inmates were asking for the protection of solitary confinement, the lawsuit says. They spent hours gathering information for investigators and Lockett readily agreed to suspend the eight guards that state investigators identified as participating in or abetting the assaults, the lawsuit says. ""They did everything they could,"" said Farnan.\n\n&gt; **The investigation that has led to nearly 100 charges against guard Harry F.

2011-12-03 08:25:25,mykeu,21,1,"Just being honest.  I know in the past I was kind of bigoted towards homosexual people until I talked with them, read about them, learned more about them and the most important part, quit being an immature dick.

So I feel like I'm in the same position now with trans folks.  I don't have anything against you, but there are things that confuse me, and if I explain them to you I might say something stupid or bigoted and I apologise in advance.  I am posting this because I want to hear from you, learn about you, and have you answer some of my questions.  I'm just a fairly typical heterosexual male from a small town that doesn't get exposed to you types of people often, so I figured this would be a good resource to use.

*  Recently there was an IAMA posted about a male to female trans saying she's been sleeping with multiple guys and not telling them about her past.  It seemed like there was a lot of condemnation from people when other Redditors expressed negative views on this behavior.  People were being heavily downvoted for saying things like they'd feel lied to etc.  My personal feelings are that I would immediately end a relationship with someone if I found out they were trans and had hidden it from me because I would feel very much I had been lied to, but if they were upfront I feel (Hypothetical, never been in this situation) that I would be much more able to look past it, and in fact it would give me something interesting to discuss with them.  Do you tell others about your past before you get intimate with them?  Do you consider it a lie / dishonest to withhold this info?  **Consider this question from the perspective of a relationship, not a one night stand.  I don't do one-night stands at all so it's difficult for me to relate to that mindset.**

*  Why do trans folks (And gays &amp; lesbians for that matter) often go balls to the wall with the gender / sexuality they associate with?  This is something that's always confused me.  For example I used to work at a gas station, and there was a group of 4 lesbians who all hung out together.  I wasn't phased by that at all, there's no reason to be of course.  What did confuse me was that they all drove HUGE Ford trucks, all wore hats, all wore baggy jeans and T-shirts, all kept a wallet in their back pocket, all got crew cuts, all tried to talk like a man etc.  This is something I've noticed in trans people too.  So you're a man that ID's as a woman?  Cool, I don't care.  But when that man IDing as a woman wears more make-up than a room full of high school girls, constantly talks about fashion and purses and stuff, knows more about women's clothing than my girlfriend etc. it strikes me as weird / they're trying too hard.

*  Me and my girl were talking about the whole trans issue and how society is going to deal with it today, which I think will be an interesting thing to observe over the next few decades from a legal perspective.  For example, say someone who was previously male but is now a post-op female uses the ladies restroom.  Most people probably wouldn't care.  What if someone who 100% appears to be male (think ripped dude with a full beard, deep voice, jeans and a flannel) walks into the woman's restroom to use it, and when questioned about it, says ""I identify as a woman, s I'm using the woman's restroom.""  Do you think the second person has just as much of a right to do this as the first person?  Do you think this might get confusing from a legal perspective, as in how do you know person #2 is being honest, or if he's just a pervert saying that so he can use the women's restroom?

* Could you talk to me some about how it feels to want to be something else than who you appear to be so bad that you would go through an operation to change your gender?  I know this sounds silly but I can't really relate...the closest things I can think of is stuff like I used to associate myself with being born to different parents than my own and / or being an alien, because I hated my parents so much that I didn't want to believe I could of sprung from them....or that I really identify with a certain period in history and feel like that is where I really belong, not this point in time.

*  This will probably sound really stupid and childish....but kind of going on the end of that last question....obviously you folks support the right of a person to identify with whichever gender they choose and modify their body to suit that decision.  What if you take things further?  If I associate myself with cats and got surgery to make my whole body hairy, get a tail, have claws etc, wear cat eye contacts., etc., would you support that?  If I ID'd with aliens and got surgery to make my body hairless and pasty white, have my body atrophy to a small size while my cranium remained large, wear solid black contacts etc., would you support that?  Basically, is there any situation where you would not support someone's desire to modify their body as they see fit?

*  What general things should someone like me (Someone who wishes trans people no ill will, but has no real exposure to them and might say / do something stupid out of ignorance) be aware of in the future to avoid making trans people feel unwelcome, judged, ostracized etc.?

*  What's cismale and cisfemale mean?  I assume it means a person who remained the gender they were born as, but what's it stand for?

*  Are transgender desires and processes only found in humans or do other animals share this trait with us?

Thanks for hearing me out.  

My only real exposure to trans people was when my older brother dated a pre-op, and I guess I felt more confused than anything by the situation.

I always tried to be nice to her and treat her with the respect I'd treat any human being with, because she was very nice to me.  But I guess I was confused by her desires in general because wanting to change my gender is something I cannot relate to, and I can't really fathom.  I come from a self-taught background of learning to accept yourself for who you are by large.

I was confused by what I should refer to her as in conversation, because in my eyes ""she"" was a ""he"" that was dressed as a girl, which I thought was just creepy.  I also thought it was weird how they acted like they were a normal heterosexual couple, when my older brother was dating another person who had an adam's apple, no breasts, a penis, a deep voice, facial hair etc.  I mean I know she identified with being a female but that didn't do anything to block out the ""fact"" in my head that I was looking at a male.  I mean hell, I wish I could fly, but I don't go around demanding people refer to me as a superhero, wearing a cape everywhere etc.  The whole idea of transgenderism just seems really strange to me.

Because I am not attracted to transmen.

She had straightened my hair like it had never been straightened before, and I looked *great!* (I'm on the right in [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/QPxzl.jpg)). So I was out 100% girl, still fairly new for me, and had a *wonderful* time for several hours shopping at the mall with my friend, and I bought my first bra at JC Penny's. I was really happy with it, and I had just gotten the same size of bra I had been borrowing from my mom.

Well when I got home and tried it on, it was way too tight... a 38B, whereas I should probably be wearing a 40B or possibly 42B. Ugh.

Anyway, I guess I'm only sad because I can't shave my face every day (or I cut myself *everywhere*), so I have to wait 2 or 3 days before I can give myself a right proper shave, get up in full girl mode again, hopefully stop by my friend's house to borrow her straightener for a quick style, and go back to the mall to return/exchange for the proper size.

**tl;dr** That's all. Just due to my stupid facial hair I can't go out the next day as a girl and have any reasonable expectation of passing. I really wish I could fearlessly go out as a girl every single day... it's what I really want to do. Just needed somewhere to rant.

-----------------------------------

**PS. Worst moment:** I was drinking from a water fountain when a dad and his little daughter (5 years old?) came up behind me and he said ""Excuse me."" She needed to use the water fountain. I was a taken a bit off-guard, but I gathered my bag and stepped aside. He said, ""Oh wow, oh geez,"" and quickly grabbed his daughter's hand and hurriedly rushed her into the ""Family"" mall bathroom upon seeing my face. Of all the people I passed and of all the many dozens of people who gave me questionable second looks (out of several thousand people), ***that*** was the worst experience of all of them. That's the one thing that really hurt while I was out today, but if *that's* the worst of the day, I'd say the experience was a thundering success, all said and done. :)

2011-12-07 09:49:52,n3rjh,80,17,"Our survey results can be downloaded [here in pdf format](http://ge.tt/8OvRLrA). 

So lets discuss the results!

178 people completed the survey but 266 did not finish, but I think we still got a good cross section of the community.

From what I can tell you as a whole want self posting, want to allow NSFW (non porn) links so long as they are clearly marked as such either in here or on /r/transgendernsfw however a slight majority leans toward allowing it here. Some people have made comments that we should allow more moderators and/or take a more active role as mods. 


Tying into that we get the impression we aren't doing everything we can to make FTM trans people as welcome as we could, while we aren't as a community going out of our way to oppress them, we aren't exactly giving the warmth that they deserve, I will do everything in my power to fix this and I will ask blueblank for permission to add 2 FTM moderators who will act as the voice of their side of our community and allow them the authority to ensure that we do not marginalize FTM people and ensure that we are as egalitarian as possible.


On to genderqueer related issues, it seems the same thing has happened here as to the FTM population and i propose the same solution. They have every right to have their voices heard.



On to site design and such

People seem to want some changes to our subreddits appearance, while the what is varying the common sentiment is that the subreddit is due for a new paint job, we will work on this and possibly have more surveys relating to this.


As for the multiple trans related subreddits fracturing the community I have thought of a solution to this, as some of them are not run by us here i propose the creation of a trans-subreddit network, where we can see a full list of affiliated subreddits and their function, we will probably use some CSS shenanigans to place this list in a visible spot, this will tie the communities closer together while still encouraging user freedom to create new subreddits, I will have to get a hold of mods from other subs to see if they would like to go for this however.

On to wiki/central database

Some people have made comments that we should allow more moderators and/or take a more active role as mods. \n\n\nTying into that we get the impression we aren't doing everything we can to make FTM trans people as welcome as we could, while we aren't as a community going out of our way to oppress them, we aren't exactly giving the warmth that they deserve, I will do everything in my power to fix this and I will ask blueblank for permission to add 2 FTM moderators who will act as the voice of their side of our community and allow them the authority to ensure that we do not marginalize FTM people and ensure that we are as egalitarian as possible.\n\n\nOn to genderqueer related issues, it seems the same thing has happened here as to the FTM population and i propose the same solution. They have every right to have their voices heard.\n\n\n\nOn to site design and such\n\nPeople seem to want some changes to our subreddits appearance, while the what is varying the common sentiment is that the subreddit is due for a new paint job, we will work on this and possibly have more surveys relating to this.\n\n\nAs for the multiple trans related subreddits fracturing the community I have thought of a solution to this, as some of them are not run by us here i propose the creation of a trans-subreddit network, where we can see a full list of affiliated subreddits and their function, we will probably use some CSS shenanigans to place this list in a visible spot, this will tie the communities closer together while still encouraging user freedom to create new subreddits, I will have to get a hold of mods from other subs to see if they would like to go for this however.\n\nOn to wiki/central database\n\nThe majority of you want some sort of central wiki or database for trans resources, we will work on this.\n\n\n**Please feel free to discuss anything regarding this survey and nothing is set in stone in any way shape or form.**"", 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': 'Survey results here!', 'created': 1323276592.0}"

Today, for the first time I have found self-acceptance that I do not want to be a lurker gazing into the transgender community.  While I have always claimed to be very open sexually, the reality is, I was raised and live an incredibly conservative lifestyle.  But, today, I have decidedly come to accept that my life won't be complete without, well...sucking a dick at some point.  I am not looking for some bizar drunk one night stand.  I don't know what I am looking for.
  
I suppose there is gearing up and heading into San Francisco, and seeing what I find in the scene.  I am not looking for an ltr, but I am looking for something that is comfortable and safe.  
  
I am looking for any recommendations on where to start my search, so any tips that I should know. I am open minded and adventurous, but also don't want to seem like a total tool.
  
I actually got picked up by a passable tg at a bar a few years ago, and was open to it, but at the time wasn't willing to reciprocate.  She was still willing, but it didn't feel right to me.  I have been regretting this moment in time for years now, and am looking for a way to hopefully find that similar spark now that I am more enthusiastic sexually.

The issue is however that most members, new or otherwise, are ignoring the fact that we still have /r/asktransgender and are instead posting actual questions for the community in here instead.

According to the ATG sidebar, /r/asktransgender is for:

&gt; Questions about, for, or from the reddit transgender community.

&gt;Open to anyone with a question.

While according to the sidebar here, including the new rules, /r/transgender is supposed to be: 

&gt;Transgender news, issues, conversation, and links of interest.

&gt;Self posting that falls under the domain of /r/asktransgender will be moderated and you will be asked to repost.

Since the allowance of self posting I have started seeing blatant questions being posted here on a regular basis that would normally have gone to ATG. This wouldn't be a problem if they were relevant to this board if it fell into ""news, issues, conversation"" about the community, or trans in general. Instead they are specific questions for the poster's own benefit, such as asking for advice on hormones, passing, and even the odd ""how do I look"" thread.

I don't know exactly what ought to be done about this, but I'm pretty sure this is not what was in mind when allowing self posting to this subreddit. So far, about the only self posts I can find that don't seem to belong on ATG instead are [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/transgender/comments/n5njs/so_i_think_the_survey_results_require_a/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/transgender/comments/n3rjh/survey_results_here/), and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/transgender/comments/n32kv/i_just_got_srs_done_im_bored_in_the_recovery_room/), although the former two and this post technically would belong in /r/metatransgender (perhaps this says something about the necessity of that board to begin with?) if we wanted to be picky.

2011-12-10 22:13:58,n7t73,4,6,"The conference was about LGBTQ Youth in the Tulsa area, and what can be done for them. A city councilor was in attendance, as were school principals, board members, and city activists.

I was one of seven speakers and five people answering questions, two of us were trans, one was gay, one pansexual, two lesbians (I was one).

The conference went incredibly well, I was mostly improvising my speech as I had not memorized it. Everyone said I did well, and the other speakers also did well. There was a huge emphasis, from all of us presenting, on increased education in the schools, and more support, and more publicity for events. The questions were primarily concerned with schools and bullying, as that was the focus of all our stories.

Oklahoma is NOT a state where LGBT people are entirely welcome, but Tulsa is the exceptional city. I was asked to help start an organization for transgender resources in town, and congratulated heavily.

I guess my point here is that I'm seeing a major turn around on things. We had TWO transgendered speakers. Probably the only two in the history of the state to attend high school as openly transgendered. We were the most articulate two, though someone gave us a sure run for the money, and she's been a poster girl for LGBT and T issues especially after she came out and got the front page of the paper both days of the weekend edition.

I do not have a recording of the event, because they asked us not to. I do have a copy of my speech, but I didn't memorize it so the version I gave was fairly different. My conclusion was completely changed. MY main points were that the Catholic population likes trans people and the Church hates them (as a general rule), that I am lucky to have money, a loving family, and an easy enough life, and that trans people are generally invisible.

My closing line came to me on the spot, and it hit ME so hard after I said it, that I feel the need to repeat it.

&gt; I am lucky. I grew up for 17 years as a rich, white male. I'm not bullied or abused or abandoned. My life is easy, I'm just doing what I can to help. I'm not the one who should be up here *major audible choke* the dead are.

So that was the highlight of my weekend. Please, be involved in local LGBT events. Emphasize the T, because we need it. Don't be invisible if you can help it. No minority has won its rights without a real fight, and we're gonna need a lot more people fighting.

However, I'm also a little bothered by this. It's the whole ""born this way"" argument. Some people feel that they are; cool. But not every trans person can say that they were *always* their target gender. What about people like me? Despite being gender-nonconforming my entire life, I had periods where I *delighted* in being a girl. Though I am definitely trans, and it's definitely a part of who I am and who I've always been, I refuse to excuse it as being born this way.

It\'s the whole ""born this way"" argument. Some people feel that they are; cool. But not every trans person can say that they were *always* their target gender. What about people like me? Despite being gender-nonconforming my entire life, I had periods where I *delighted* in being a girl.

Hi - 

I am a second-year law student at UC Hastings. I am currently working on my legal note for the Hastings Women's Law Journal. My topic advocates eliminating gender markers from health insurance and diagnostic codes. I believe that in an era of multiple mechanisms of identifying individuals including through Social Security numbers, and policy ID codes, the M/F marker is superfluous. There is a practice in both private and Medicaid insurance to deny people coverage for even basic procedures because the gender marker on their insurance code does not match the provider's definition for gender-specific services. 

As part of my research into this topic, I am seeking out denial of coverage letters people have received from insurance carriers or medical practitioners for treatment related to gender/gender ID. If you are willing to share them, I would enormously appreciate copies of any letters you have received from health practitioners or insurance providers on the subject. I know of people receiving denials of coverage for prostate exams, pap smears, other gynecological care, breast exams, and broken arms. Any ""gender does not match"" denial is of interest to me. 

I am also interested in letters people have received rejecting applications for insurance coverage overall on the basis of an intersex condition, GID, or a related diagnosis.

Any letters I receive (if they are not already redacted) will be redacted before I will use them as reference material in the note. 

If you have any questions or are willing to share a letter, please email me walshamk@uchastings.edu. Also, please feel free to cross post or forward this request.

The first draft of this paper will be completed by January 13th, so if you are interested in helping with the project, please let me know soon.

2011-12-17 05:17:41,ng26u,0,0,"over the summer i met this girl that i had known in high school. in high school at a party my friends and her friends both tried very hard to get us together because we were both""artsy"". i just wasnt feeling it and wasnt attracted to her and it never amounted to anything, but we did become friends. 
fast forward two years and we are both sophomores in college and we meet on the train. since i havent been getting much action lately, and remember she once had an interest in me i figured i would gather the courage and get her phone number and hang out, and hopefully have a relationship with this girl. everything worked out and we decided to hang out and smoke weed, and get food. However once i was stoned i lost interest in her sexually again and decided it was best i kept the friendship platonic. we didnt hang out alone after that but she was neighbors with one of my best friends so i saw her a few times. she would try flirting with me, but i tried my best to just be friendly to her. on my last day in town before heading back to school she calls me to hang out, i tell her i couldnt because i was going home but it was actually because i was already with my friends, and didnt want to be around her if i knew i wasnt going to be getting with her.
2 months later (this october) i get a phone call from my friend asking how i was doing. i replied what do you mean, and he says well you know that girl you had a fling with over the summer she hung herself. i was taken aback at how someone like her could do such a thing.
when getting back home for thanksgiving break my good friend and her neighbor tells me that she was bipolar and stopped taking her medicine, which lead to her dropping out of school and eventual suicide. later that night one of my friends drunk exclaimed to me ""god dam it dude you shoulda just put your penis in her and she would be alive"". A day or two later during the same break i was with some girls from our high school and they started talking about a rumor from middle school that she was a hermaphrodite and maybe that could be the reason. i remembered the rumor. although i never had a sexual attraction to her i was attracted to her as a human being, and didnt want people to (what i thought at the time would be) tarnishing her name so i told them to stfu, and left the party.
laying in my bed stoned one night i started to wonder if the rumors were true and if that could be why i was never attracted to her, and that it could be the reason she committed suicide. 
i finally understand why it is so hard for some of you people out there. i wish i could have communicated with her better instead of just ignoring, and not accepting her advances at what could have been a good friendship even though it could never have been a sexual relationship.
my two questions to you people are could i have helped, and should i investigate further by asking her neighbor my good friend just for my knowledge if the transgender rumors were true?
thanks

2011-12-23 15:29:55,nnzbd,3,16,"So this post has nothing to do with being transgendered or anything like that, but I know a lot of us like to post pics of ourselves to get ideas on how well we are passing, etc... 

A lot of them are terribly lit, so it's hard for anyone to really tell what you look like. I'm not a professional photographer, more like an advanced amateur, but I'm gonna try to summarize in a few paragraphs some basic lighting techniques and poses that hopefully some of you will be able to use so we can see your true self better :)

First of all, what you use to capture the image doesn't matter that much. A high end DSLR with a good lens will obviously capture the best quality, but a webcam, phone camera, cheap point and shoot, anything really, will do. Some of these techniques will work with some cameras and some won't, you can PM me if you want some specific pointers for what your situation is. 

First, lighting. For us to see anything we need to have whatever you're taking a picture of lit fairly well. This matters most with the face, as shadows are actually important so we can see facial features, but you don't want too harsh of shadows. The most important thing here is to NOT USE THE ON-CAMERA FLASH. That will wash out all features on your face and you get the very characteristic deer in headlights look that is there on 98% of facebook pics. 

Here is a basic lighting setup that should work for most people if you want to take a picture of your head, neck and shoulders. I could draw a diagram but let's use our imaginations here. Pretend you are sitting at a desk. To your right or left you have a main light. This could be a desk light that has no shade on it or like a banker's lamp where you turn the top so it is directly lighting you (I.e. you can see the light bulb). On the other side you have another light, but this one has a shade on it, or is pointing towards a wall behind the desk. The idea here is that you're filling shadows that the main light creates but it is not as bright as the main light and more diffuse. Lastly, you have a light  slight behind you to one side or the other and out of the picture. This is a hair light. It can be any kind of light, but this is going to give definition to your hair on one side or the other. In this basic three light setup the camera would be in front of you between the main light and the fill light. 

Oh hell, here's a poor diagram:
                         
                        camera
       fill light                             main light


                         you



     hair light


Now, if you have a willing participant, they can operate the camera, but if you're like most of us, this will be a solo activity. This is where if you are using a webcam you'll be fine, and if your using any other kind of camera with a self timer, that timer is going to come into play. If you have a mini tripod or something that's great, but if you don't, just prop the camera up using books or something so the lens is at approximately eye level. Set the self timer and start taking pictures in auto mode but without the flash, beautiful. There are going to be lots of bad ones, but you should get a few good ones. Post those for all of us to see!

This is getting long, but I just want to give a few other posing tips. If you are taking a picture where you can see limbs, bend anything you can. Stiff joints look bad in pictures. Also, try not to be completely perpendicular to the camera, that looks like a mug shot, try to be at an angle. Lastly, there are masculine and feminine head poses. If you are at an angle to the camera and you tilt your head towards your shoulder closest to the camera, that's feminine. If you tilt your head away from the closest shoulder that's masculine. Try it and I think you'll notice there's a difference even though that seems kinda stupid.

Lastly, again, if you have specific questions about anything photography related, please ask here or PM me. I'm not a pro, but I think I'll be able to give you some solid tips.

http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/3/579.full.pdf+html

What can be considered rare is the motivation to detect a chimera. Indeed, in his book ""How New Humans are Made"", Dr. Boklage asserts most chimeras have no physical abnormalities and indeed look like everyone else. He also adds that Chimerism need not be present in the blood. So without physical abnormalities or strange blood typing to act as a motivation, there is little or no reason for a clinician to pursue the diagnosis.

http://tinyurl.com/7l89zct

While there may be no physical signs of chimerism, the condition might be expressed in the behavior of a chimera. The creation or artificial chimeras lends credence to this idea. The creation of artificial “brain chimeras” is becoming a routine practice in the field of neurobiology.

One such study conducted by German scientists created a brood of Japanese quails with female brains and male physiology. The male quails w/ female brains did not display mounting or crowing behavior.

“Male Japanese quails with female brains do not show male sexual behaviors”

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC164695/pdf/1007959.pdf

The changes in observed behavior were the direct result of a hybridized hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad (HPG) axis. The HPG axis coordinates displays of sexual behavior with reproductive physiology. Thus the quail chimeras with female brains responded differently to physiological signals in adulthood.

Could it be the HPG axis also tells an organism: what gender it is (including a body map), what gender it should mate with, and what displays of sexual behavior to express?

Also, remember the studies conducted which revealed the number of neurons in the bed nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BSTc) of male-to-female TS was similar to that of the females?

The Stria Terminalis is a component of the HPG axis and hybridization may likely be the reason why it presents with female neuron numbers in transsexual women. If the Stria Terminalis in these subjects were tested using the right methods, the tests may reveal these regions were actually of comprised different genetic material than the hosts.

In sum, I believe human spontaneous chimeras are common variants in human embryo development. I also believe chimeras which result from plural pregnancies become humans who are attracted to humans of the same sex and/or humans whose brain sex does not match their physiology.

In other words, homosexual &amp; transgendered.

I replied ""Of course I can, he\'s been the most supportive and accepting family member in this house!"" then she got defensive saying ""I\'ve been accepting- are you saying I haven\'t been accepting?!?!"" (I know the nerve right?) and this is where I knock her right on her ass saying ""No. you constantly misgender me, you\'ve brought up my nose job in front of everyone five times, and you have this general hostility towards me... Now I really don\'t care what you see me as in your head, you think I\'m a guy that\'s fine. But out of pure respect could you please not call he/him or use my birth name ever again- it\'s insulting and you know it, so quit it.""\n\nThere was a moment of silence and then she changed the subject, then found another family member to annoy. We didn\'t speak to each other for the rest of the day but she hugged me goodbye when it was time to leave. Hopefully I made a difference in her thinking.\n\nanyhow if you\'ve read this far thank you, I\'m kind of proud of myself and just wanted to share. thanks again.', 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': 'A quick little Trans-mas story about how I stood up to the one family member everyone else seems to be afraid of.', 'created': 1325040480.0}"
