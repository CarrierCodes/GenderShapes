So the guy in the cubicle next to me and I talk movies a lot, and I got a hold of a copy of Cloud Atlas way ahead of release, and I'm planning on watching it tonight and not for any trans-related reasons. Just seems like a damn interesting movie.

I mean, I figure I'll always be interested in trans issues to some extent, I just see it as something that really is only the focus of your life for 4-5 years, whereas through my desire to find love, my lesbianness will follow me for life.

2013-01-04 05:44:58,15xpme,0,1,"(This is a story/essay I wrote that I wanted to share. Not sure where to put it so here it is! Hope you like it!)

A few nights ago I was waiting in line for the bathroom at Smart Bar, Chicago. While I’m still nervous about using the women’s bathroom, I was especially so this time. It’s not that I thought Smart Bar attracts a particularly trans unfriendly crowd, instead there were two very specific reasons for this nervousness. One, I knew the lights in the men’s bathroom were pretty bright and figured the women’s bathroom would be bright as well; and two, the line was realllly long. To me, bright lights plus lots of people equals a greater chance of being read. Another *teensy* factor may have been that I was high as hell and sorta tweaking out.
 
So far the line is still in the main area of the club and it’s pretty dark. I look around at my fellow women to try and gauge their potential trans-friendliness: *She looks pretty alt, that’s good. Eh, she kinda looks like a bitch- try not to let her notice you. She’s a talker, stay away from her or she’ll try to talk to YOU*. I accidentally make eye contact with a girl and give her a weak smile; she smiles back. So far so good! The line begins to move and we head through the door into the bathroom. Actually, it’s more accurately described as a waiting room with couches and a bunch of mirrors and OH GOD THOSE LIGHTS. I grimace and see my face reflected multiple times in the mirrors. Great, a few more ways for people to stare at me!

Inside I immediately notice the social situation is much different than the men’s room. For starters, there are girls just hanging out. Talking, laughing, texting, just chillin on the countertops like it’s no big deal. Casual conversations are initiated with phrases like “I like your top” and friends talk to each other through the stalls. There’s a girl passed out on a plush bench-thing and her friend sits next to her stroking her hair. A few minutes later a bouncer would come in and check-in on passed out-girl. After she woke her up, passed out-girl assured her everything was cool then some rando started taking pictures with her. It was REALLY. WEIRD.

Through all of this I am standing somewhere in the middle of the line losing my mind.  Here I am with twenty-two years of awkward male socializing, a dick crammed somewhere in my dress, I’m stoned in the most feminine place possible, and I’m feeling pretty out of place. The line doesn’t run along a wall so we are standing out in the open, exposed for everyone to look at. I try and play it cool by pretending to be extremely interested in my phone while praying that no one tries to talk to me. As far as I can tell no one seems to be staring at me, but I also don’t want to invite any attention by gawking around like a fool. Eventually, since it seems like the right thing to do, I turn to look at myself in the mirror. Instead of myself, however, I see a quasi-feminine person with too much eyeliner starting back.
 
*Jeez, they’ll let anybody into the women’s bathroom these days*, I say to the Stranger. But looking longer, I decide this is not someone who appears completely out of place. *Appears out of place* is the right phrase, though, as they are not all that they seem. *On the contrary!* The Stranger says to me, *YOU are the wolf. You are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Just last month you were here and you were using the other bathroom. Your friends sometimes call you “Nathan” even when you are wearing a dress*. I quickly turn away from the mirror and look around the bathroom all shify-eyed, making sure no one is reading my mind. It doesn’t look like anybody is so I turn back to the mirror. *That’s not true!* I think-yell at the stranger, *I am just as much myself no matter what bathroom I use. In fact, I am quite sure who I am but I’m not too sure who you are.* I look hard at the reflection and slowly the threads of similarity begin to tie together. The nose, the eyes, the whole face! It’s mine! It is not the Stranger who is the reflection, but me! Upon realizing this our worlds reverse and I am transported into the mirror, enabling me to view the Stranger who was actually standing in line. You see, the frightened person waiting in line was not me; instead I am the person reflected in the mirror who belongs in the women’s bathroom. The excessive eyeliner, the hair, the soft features, the dress, the breasts, the penis- YES, EVEN THE PENIS- they are all mine. I’m just not used to them!

During my existential crisis the line has moved forward and I am first in line for the toilets. But I’m not afraid; I’m an empowered quasi-female looking person who belongs in the women’s bathrooms! A stall opens up and I willing step forward, eager to sit upon my righteous spot. I hike up the dress, drop the panties, take a seat, turn my feet at an inward angle, and pee right into that fucking toilet. And when I’m done I grab some toilet paper and wipe off that dick because I’m a female goddamnit!! 

The entire experience was easily the most excitement I’ve ever had in a bathroom. But more than that, it was about overcoming fear. We live in a very gendered society and bathrooms represent the pinnacle of that division. Due to the strict gender rules surrounding them, bathrooms can be very continuous places for transpeople who just want to do their business in peace (or have existential crises). For me, overcoming my anxiety about the women’s bathroom and realizing that I truly belong there was one of the biggest steps forward in my transition. I hope that at some point every transperson can experience such a profound connection with their gender as I did in that bathroom.

She’s a talker, stay away from her or she’ll try to talk to YOU*. I accidentally make eye contact with a girl and give her a weak smile; she smiles back. So far so good! The line begins to move and we head through the door into the bathroom. Actually, it’s more accurately described as a waiting room with couches and a bunch of mirrors and OH GOD THOSE LIGHTS. I grimace and see my face reflected multiple times in the mirrors. Great, a few more ways for people to stare at me!\n\nInside I immediately notice the social situation is much different than the men’s room. For starters, there are girls just hanging out. Talking, laughing, texting, just chillin on the countertops like it’s no big deal. Casual conversations are initiated with phrases like “I like your top” and friends talk to each other through the stalls. There’s a girl passed out on a plush bench-thing and her friend sits next to her stroking her hair. A few minutes later a bouncer would come in and check-in on passed out-girl. After she woke her up, passed out-girl assured her everything was cool then some rando started taking pictures with her. It was REALLY. WEIRD.\n\nThrough all of this I am standing somewhere in the middle of the line losing my mind.  Here I am with twenty-two years of awkward male socializing, a dick crammed somewhere in my dress, I’m stoned in the most feminine place possible, and I’m feeling pretty out of place. The line doesn’t run along a wall so we are standing out in the open, exposed for everyone to look at. I try and play it cool by pretending to be extremely interested in my phone while praying that no one tries to talk to me. As far as I can tell no one seems to be staring at me, but I also don’t want to invite any attention by gawking around like a fool. Eventually, since it seems like the right thing to do, I turn to look at myself in the mirror. Instead of myself, however, I see a quasi-feminine person with too much eyeliner starting back.\n \n*Jeez, they’ll let anybody into the women’s bathroom these days*, I say to the Stranger. But looking longer, I decide this is not someone who appears completely out of place. *Appears out of place* is the right phrase, though, as they are not all that they seem. *On the contrary!* The Stranger says to me, *YOU are the wolf. You are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Just last month you were here and you were using the other bathroom. Your friends sometimes call you “Nathan” even when you are wearing a dress*. I quickly turn away from the mirror and look around the bathroom all shify-eyed, making sure no one is reading my mind. It doesn’t look like anybody is so I turn back to the mirror. *That’s not true!* I think-yell at the stranger, *I am just as much myself no matter what bathroom I use. In fact, I am quite sure who I am but I’m not too sure who you are.* I look hard at the reflection and slowly the threads of similarity begin to tie together. The nose, the eyes, the whole face! It’s mine! It is not the Stranger who is the reflection, but me! Upon realizing this our worlds reverse and I am transported into the mirror, enabling me to view the Stranger who was actually standing in line. You see, the frightened person waiting in line was not me; instead I am the person reflected in the mirror who belongs in the women’s bathroom. The excessive eyeliner, the hair, the soft features, the dress, the breasts, the penis- YES, EVEN THE PENIS- they are all mine. I’m just not used to them!\n\nDuring my existential crisis the line has moved forward and I am first in line for the toilets. But I’m not afraid; I’m an empowered quasi-female looking person who belongs in the women’s bathrooms! A stall opens up and I willing step forward, eager to sit upon my righteous spot. I hike up the dress, drop the panties, take a seat, turn my feet at an inward angle, and pee right into that fucking toilet. And when I’m done I grab some toilet paper and wipe off that dick because I’m a female goddamnit!! \n\nThe entire experience was easily the most excitement I’ve ever had in a bathroom. But more than that, it was about overcoming fear. We live in a very gendered society and bathrooms represent the pinnacle of that division. Due to the strict gender rules surrounding them, bathrooms can be very continuous places for transpeople who just want to do their business in peace (or have existential crises). For me, overcoming my anxiety about the women’s bathroom and realizing that I truly belong there was one of the biggest steps forward in my transition. I hope that at some point every transperson can experience such a profound connection with their gender as I did in that bathroom.\n\n\n', 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': ""In Sheep's Clothing"", 'created': 1357303498.0}"

2013-01-07 19:18:27,164ufj,0,1,"Around age 8 I started dreaming about being a girl. Constantly. I came up with so many plots that resulted in my feminization, from magic, to the work of god, to magical chemicals (I nearly got that one right), to random happenstance. I started cross-dressing around age 12. Without a sister of similar size, I got by stealing clothes from my mother, and fashioning clothes from scraps and ill fitting garments I already owned. When I realized that this was not a unique affliction, I was filled with conflicting feelings about what I should do. “Am I transgender?” I asked myself, “Am I just a boy who likes women’s clothes? Am I gay?” Eventually, I decided to repress these feelings. Full of self hate, and hiding this huge burden I carried, I slid by. I still cross-dressed fairly regularly, even after my little brother found my stash, and I had to throw it out (He didn’t realize what he had found, and my mother never saw the trash bag I smuggled it out it [Honestly, this happened quite a few times, and I’m surprised my family never caught on]). Throughout high school I was miserable, got bad grades, and was perpetually distracted; lost in daydreams of happiness. I started seeing a psychologist for Social Anxiety, and that helped, until college. I started strong, but promptly fell into my old ways, and as the year came to a close, I found myself one again excited to go home and have my brief moments of peace. In July, I had a breakdown, and realized how unhappy I was, and went to reddit looking for a solution. At first I thought I was bigender (I didn’t want to be a girl all the time, just some of it), but I soon realized that wasn’t true; I want, need, to be a girl. I bought a new stash of feminine apparel, and spent my last month at home in girl-mode as often as I could. Eventually, I came out to my psychologist, and tried to work through some of my issues with him, but didn’t really get anywhere before summer’s end. When school began anew, I was miserable once more. Stricken by my old anxiety, and a new depression, I fell apart, failed two classes, and drifted away from a close friend. Now, as I start anti-anxiety/depressants, and face a new semester, I realize that I need to move forward, both in my studies, and my knowledge of myself, that brings us to today.

My conundrums:

**1:** I need to come out at some point, and that scares the crap out of me, even though it shouldn’t (In my case). My Mother is very supportive, very pro-lgbt, and a generally pleasant person. My father will come to accept it; he’s never been prone to bigotry, and I don’t see that changing. That said, I’m scared of what will happen to them if and when I do come out. My mom is prone to depression, and easily stressed, and I don’t want to add to her impending total freakout. My dad has given up a lot for our family, and has always expected me to be just as traditionally masculine as he is (I’ve already disappointed him on that front), and I feel like coming out would just be a slap in the face to him. In my more expended family (We often get together in groups of 30+), I don’t know how people will react (I expect well, considering how the reacted to my cousins who are gay, and their various partners [whom I tend to like more than the cousins themselves]).

**1a** : Coming out to friends is another issue. I really have 3 close friends, and maybe half a dozen close acquaintances. I’ll focus on friends. 

**1a^a** : My closest friend I met in middle school. I hated him when we met initially, but after standing up for him when a good friend at the time was giving him shit, we became friends. We’ve been there for each other through a lot (Although not in an emotional sense, really). He’s transphobic. I’m not sure how severely, but the sort of person who has on more than one occasion gone on a tirade about how he “can’t imagine why someone would mutilate their own body like that.” This is concerning.

**1a^b** : My next closest friend goes to school with me, and I met last year after being locked out of my room. He’s an odd fellow, but one of the most generally pleasant people I’ve ever met (friend a^a has a personality best described as “abrasive”). That said, Friend a^b presents a different sort of issue: he’s gay, and crushing hard over guy mode me. This isn’t speculation, he’s said it outright. While I’m sure he’ll be supportive, I know that my coming out will cause him a great deal of stress, and I can’t get rid of the idea that he’s only my friend out of some hope that I’ll realize I’m gay and fall for him (This is unlikely, and irrational, I know, but I can’t shake the idea).

**1a^c** : Finally, we reach my freshman roommate. We were good friends last year, but drifted apart somewhat over the last semester. He was raised religiously and still holds on to some of that. He sometimes falls into old habits, and manners of speech (He’s a big one for using gay as a pejorative, always apologising for it, but saying it accidentally nonetheless). Last year we talked about living with each other next year, when we would have enough credits to live in the swanky off-campus housing owned by the school. I’m afraid of losing him as a friend, and as a potential housemate in the future, even though that ship may have already sailed.

**1a^addendum** : Depending on the timetable on which things happen, I may have to come out to my current roommate. He’s a very religious fellow, and we have few similar interests, but we get along fine enough to peacefully cohabitate for the moment. I've always resent him though, because he’s the reason I can’t get away with dressing frequently, shaving my legs, etc. He’s just clever enough to notice that sort of thing, and I don’t want to deal with being forced to explain before I’m ready.

**2** : More importantly, I need to figure out whether I need to transition. I think I do, but at the same time, when pressured to explain why, I always fall apart. I’ve got a lot of confusion and trepidation and anxiety floating around, and my inability to put my feelings into concise explanations only makes this worse. Added to that, my psychologist doesn't specialize in trans issues, and as such doesn't seem to know what we’re doing (He’s helped me a lot, but we both recognize that I need to see a specialist, the problem is getting to the point that I’m comfortable in doing that). 

**3** : Now  for a break from heavy stuff for a question: would it be weird to keep my current name? Not my full name, of course, that reeks of masculinity, but rather the name I go by day-to-day (I’m nervous to put it here, because I’m not out, and it links back to me, but it’s AJ). It doesn't really carry any strong gender connotation, and I’ve found quite a few women who use the name. Would that be weird?

**4** : Overall, I just want to that everyone in the reddit LGBT, and especially trans* community, for helping me get to the place I am now. This time last year, I was prepared to live my miserable little life a guy. I was ready to coast through life, working jobs that I would hate, and living a life that wasn't my own, but now I’m able to see that there might just be a light at the end of the tunnel.

TL;DR: Various anxieties, various troubles, don't know what I'm doing, etc, etc.

I started strong, but promptly fell into my old ways, and as the year came to a close, I found myself one again excited to go home and have my brief moments of peace. In July, I had a breakdown, and realized how unhappy I was, and went to reddit looking for a solution. At first I thought I was bigender (I didn’t want to be a girl all the time, just some of it), but I soon realized that wasn’t true; I want, need, to be a girl. I bought a new stash of feminine apparel, and spent my last month at home in girl-mode as often as I could. Eventually, I came out to my psychologist, and tried to work through some of my issues with him, but didn’t really get anywhere before summer’s end. When school began anew, I was miserable once more. Stricken by my old anxiety, and a new depression, I fell apart, failed two classes, and drifted away from a close friend. Now, as I start anti-anxiety/depressants, and face a new semester, I realize that I need to move forward, both in my studies, and my knowledge of myself, that brings us to today.\n\nMy conundrums:\n\n**1:** I need to come out at some point, and that scares the crap out of me, even though it shouldn’t (In my case). My Mother is very supportive, very pro-lgbt, and a generally pleasant person. My father will come to accept it; he’s never been prone to bigotry, and I don’t see that changing. That said, I’m scared of what will happen to them if and when I do come out. My mom is prone to depression, and easily stressed, and I don’t want to add to her impending total freakout. My dad has given up a lot for our family, and has always expected me to be just as traditionally masculine as he is (I’ve already disappointed him on that front), and I feel like coming out would just be a slap in the face to him. In my more expended family (We often get together in groups of 30+), I don’t know how people will react (I expect well, considering how the reacted to my cousins who are gay, and their various partners [whom I tend to like more than the cousins themselves]).\n\n**1a** : Coming out to friends is another issue. I really have 3 close friends, and maybe half a dozen close acquaintances. I’ll focus on friends. \n\n**1a^a** : My closest friend I met in middle school. I hated him when we met initially, but after standing up for him when a good friend at the time was giving him shit, we became friends. We’ve been there for each other through a lot (Although not in an emotional sense, really). He’s transphobic. I’m not sure how severely, but the sort of person who has on more than one occasion gone on a tirade about how he “can’t imagine why someone would mutilate their own body like that.” This is concerning.\n\n**1a^b** : My next closest friend goes to school with me, and I met last year after being locked out of my room. He’s an odd fellow, but one of the most generally pleasant people I’ve ever met (friend a^a has a personality best described as “abrasive”). That said, Friend a^b presents a different sort of issue: he’s gay, and crushing hard over guy mode me. This isn’t speculation, he’s said it outright. While I’m sure he’ll be supportive, I know that my coming out will cause him a great deal of stress, and I can’t get rid of the idea that he’s only my friend out of some hope that I’ll realize I’m gay and fall for him (This is unlikely, and irrational, I know, but I can’t shake the idea).\n\n**1a^c** : Finally, we reach my freshman roommate. We were good friends last year, but drifted apart somewhat over the last semester. He was raised religiously and still holds on to some of that. He sometimes falls into old habits, and manners of speech (He’s a big one for using gay as a pejorative, always apologising for it, but saying it accidentally nonetheless). Last year we talked about living with each other next year, when we would have enough credits to live in the swanky off-campus housing owned by the school. I’m afraid of losing him as a friend, and as a potential housemate in the future, even though that ship may have already sailed.\n\n**1a^addendum** : Depending on the timetable on which things happen, I may have to come out to my current roommate. He’s a very religious fellow, and we have few similar interests, but we get along fine enough to peacefully cohabitate for the moment. I\'ve always resent him though, because he’s the reason I can’t get away with dressing frequently, shaving my legs, etc. He’s just clever enough to notice that sort of thing, and I don’t want to deal with being forced to explain before I’m ready.\n\n**2** : More importantly, I need to figure out whether I need to transition. I think I do, but at the same time, when pressured to explain why, I always fall apart. I’ve got a lot of confusion and trepidation and anxiety floating around, and my inability to put my feelings into concise explanations only makes this worse. Added to that, my psychologist doesn\'t specialize in trans issues, and as such doesn\'t seem to know what we’re doing (He’s helped me a lot, but we both recognize that I need to see a specialist, the problem is getting to the point that I’m comfortable in doing that). \n\n**3** : Now  for a break from heavy stuff for a question: would it be weird to keep my current name? Not my full name, of course, that reeks of masculinity, but rather the name I go by day-to-day (I’m nervous to put it here, because I’m not out, and it links back to me, but it’s AJ). It doesn\'t really carry any strong gender connotation, and I’ve found quite a few women who use the name. Would that be weird?\n\n**4** : Overall, I just want to that everyone in the reddit LGBT, and especially trans* community, for helping me get to the place I am now. This time last year, I was prepared to live my miserable little life a guy. I was ready to coast through life, working jobs that I would hate, and living a life that wasn\'t my own, but now I’m able to see that there might just be a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nTL;DR: Various anxieties, various troubles, don\'t know what I\'m doing, etc, etc.\n\nEDIT: this isn\'t really a rant so much as a ""My brain is full of stuff and I need to dump it somewhere""-thing.

I'm (relatively) recently out as trans to friends and family and have started taking steps along my journey. The next mile-stone is in a couple of weeks (23rd!), my first meeting with the local mental health authority (following a referral from a pretty clueless GP). As it approaches, I'm getting quite apprehensive and am starting to fixate on and stress over it. As such, I was hoping that some of you lovely people would be able to help and advice on what to expect, what things/questions are likely to come up etc. and is there anything I should do to 'prepare' etc.?

I've been stressing and worried over it for the past few days, and don't see myself calming down anytime soon :p.
I do know that it's ""nothing to worry about"" and to just ""speak your mind and say what you feel"", but there are a number of things I can't help but worry over. Firstly, are pre-existing (or evidence thereof) mental-health/behavioral issues likely to 'count against' me/be an obstacle of my transition? 
Am I expected to go 'dressed'?

Is there an element of testing/pass-fail to this or further meetings? I.e. if I give a 'wrong' answer etc. (wrong way of putting it, I know, but I hope you get my point) is it possible for the councilor to send me home with a blunt 'no, you're not trans. Stop trying'? 

And is there anything you'd suggest not mentioning, or which is likely to 'count against' me should it come up (generally speaking, obviously you don't know the details of my personal life)?

Thanks again, for this and all the other help I've taken from reading here.

2013-01-09 10:08:38,168qe4,3,2,"Okay, first of all I think it's right that people air their grievences of their treatment on the NHS - it's the only way things will ever change. That being said, I think it's also *very* important to ensure that those observing from the outside are not deterred from getting the treatment they need due to what *may* (I dunno, I could be lucky?) be isolated incidents. 

I think the most important thing to remember is that your doctor is only human. As with all humans, some can be assholes and it's important to stand up to those kind of people. Others are simply uninformed and require assistance in helping you. Remember, guidelines state that treatment should be **patient-led**. Remind him of this. In any case, you have a right to proper treatment and a right to demand to see a more competent doctor if need be. I had to see my GP this morning after my psych evaluation and blood tests. My end goal was to come away with a referral to a GIC (Gender Identity Clinic), even though I know the waiting times for those places are pretty lengthy. That being said, I only started this whole process around three months ago (and yes, I'm kicking myself that I didn't start it earlier) so I'm pleased to be this far along already.

My GP this morning confessed to having absolutely no idea what terminology to use or what to expect out of the whole process. This is the second time I've seen him and I dropped off some literature for him to read (namely the [NHS Gender Varience Guidelines for GPs](http://www.beaumontsociety.org.uk/Help%20&amp;%20advice/NHS%20publications/doh-guidelines-for-clinicians.pdf) and [this excellent summary / FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cKPA8aZJre4xsgkKmZ62MsuJUulK0ddGqBuWZoSOjTM/edit?pli=1) which he was thankful for. **I cannot stress enough how useful this was for me in showing 
I'd done my research, that I'm in a stable frame of mind and that I was serious**. It's the third time I've given a medical professional these documents and each time was met with enthusiasm. 

We had a frank and open discussion which helped us both enormously. I explained how dysphoria makes me feel, that I'm worried about the ongoing effects of testosterone and that, while I don't care too much about genital dysphoria, body hair is a serious issue for me. I hate it. I also explained that I'm worried about testosterone clouding judgement (how many of you have asked yourself whether it's ""just a fetish""?) and that I could seriously do with getting on hormones quickly. Not only that, but it could save the Primary Care Trust a whole heap of money if I decide that this isn't the right path for me *before* I get to the GIC -- he agreed, and I came away with not only my referral to the GIC but also a referral to an endocrinologist at the local hospital AND he's looking into PCT funding for laser hair removal.

In other words, I fucking love social health care.",transgender,"In light of recent UK NHS bashing on twitter, here's my positive (so far) experience up to this morning",1357751318.0,"{'created_utc': 1357726118, 'id': '168qe4', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Okay, first of all I think it\'s right that people air their grievences of their treatment on the NHS - it\'s the only way things will ever change. That being said, I think it\'s also *very* important to ensure that those observing from the outside are not deterred from getting the treatment they need due to what *may* (I dunno, I could be lucky?) be isolated incidents. \n\nI think the most important thing to remember is that your doctor is only human. As with all humans, some can be assholes and it\'s important to stand up to those kind of people. Others are simply uninformed and require assistance in helping you. Remember, guidelines state that treatment should be **patient-led**. Remind him of this. In any case, you have a right to proper treatment and a right to demand to see a more competent doctor if need be. I had to see my GP this morning after my psych evaluation and blood tests. My end goal was to come away with a referral to a GIC (Gender Identity Clinic), even though I know the waiting times for those places are pretty lengthy.

2013-01-13 06:42:46,16hc56,7,11,"It was requested elsewhere on reddit that I give my personal encounters with transphobia. As some background, I'm a student at a small private university in California, in the United States. The university has 4 stars for gender identity protections from campus climate, and just last semester a student group regarding transgender/genderqueer issues was formed. They found a massive amount of challenges starting almost instantly, and a good portion of those were because of me. To my knowledge I am the only transwoman on campus, as all the other members of the group are cis allies of FAAB. On November 23 a smaller version of this story was presented in the campus dining hall as part of the ""Share your Story"" event by the feminist organization on campus. That version had no descriptions of the campus and used some placenames that would not be comprehensible to anyone not familiar with the campus. Furthermore that version only contain the first two paragraphs, the descriptions of what happened on October 15,29, and November 8, and the last paragraph. The story contains direct quotes from some rather hateful people, with any slurs being uncensored, and so the whole story comes with a massive trigger warning:

I'm just the girl with green eyes. I don't understand why everyone
around me gives me these strange stares, like I somehow shouldn't be
here. I can't even leave my dorm without someone thinking i'm
some kind of freak.

Its not just stares. People call me 'fag', 'shemale', 'he-she' and the
like. Just because I look like a boy doesn't mean I am one! I don't
like it, and I'm working to change it. But for now, I still feel
threatened unless I try to be someone I'm not.

Its been going on for almost three months now. It started on October
8. I was going to a meeting of the university's transgender student
group, which was of course in our campus LGBT center. Here, we have
some magnetic words on our filing cabinet which people can arrange
into statements like ""trans women are women"", ""queer love is hard
love"", ""I hide because people discriminate"", ""gender is sex fag"" or
""men dress like women and they are fags"". I'm certain the last two
weren't what the magnets were supposed to be used for. We fixed the
two problem statements, though were somewhat worried.

On October 15, I was just walking across the University center lawn,
in disguise of course. I gave no hints that I was a girl. And yet,
someone on the other end of the lawn yelled ""Hey, it's that shemale!""
at me. I turned to look at them, and they responded with ""Oh, it's
looking at us!"" She! She's looking at us!

The next day was the beginning of spirit week. I was going to the same
LGBT center to see what to do regarding what happened yesterday, and
as my friends and I were looking into what to do, we noticed something
odd on the filing cabinet. ""A trans girl is a he she"". That really
shouldn't be there. So we removed it and prepared for spirit day. We
stood against bullying, and a quarter of the school was in purple.

But it didn't end there. Two weeks later on October 29, I went out
without a disguise.  I was at the University Center, and those same
people were there. I could tell by their voices. They were
laughing. Laughing at me, as if I were a circus clown. Did nobody
think anything of this?  Are they all that mean?

Perhaps they are. On November 5, I was going to another meeting of the
university's trans group. I felt no need to disguise myself for a
trans group meeting. The problem is that to get there from where I
live, I have to walk across an open field, on a brightly lit
path. There was a club soccer game being played in that field, and
some of the athletes on the bench noticed that I don't look like a
normal girl. Their reaction to this was to point and laugh.

More recently, on November 8, I was just walking to my car to meet
some friends. I don't need to hide who I am around my friends, do I?
But it was not my friends who first saw me. No, it was them. The same
people who cause all those problems for me in October. They pulled
into the parking lot just as I walked out the door of my dorm. One of
them said ""What the hell is that thing?"". Then another said something
I really couldn't understand. It must have been really funny, because
they all burst out laughing. It must have been so funny that they
forgot to stop pointing at me.

But it still wasn't over. Even though I should have learned that by
this point I can't go out without a VERY good disguise, even if I'm
going someplace accepting, I hadn't. So, on November 20, I went out
across that field, and there were some people coming back. As we
passed in the field, I heard one of them say ""I wonder where she was
going all dressed up like that"". Hooray! Finally someone who sees me
for who I truly am. That happiness was crushed within seconds when the
other said ""That thing was a guy"". It got even worse when the first
responded by shouting ""WHAT THE FUCK?"". It somehow became worse still
when he did it again. And again.

Just a week later, I was again walking across the same field, for the
same reason, still without a disguise. Right next to that field are
tennis courts, and there were children's tennis lessons just ending at
the time. One of the parents saw me. She came up to me and told me not
""Recruit [her] child into the sinful gay lifestyle"". I ran. I didn't
stop until I was well away. But it was someone from outside, they
don't matter. I don't need tell anyone about what someone unimportant
said, do I?

December was winter break, so I could just hide in my room the entire
time. I can't be hurt there. At least, not yet anyway. January 7th is
when classes started up again, and just 2 days later I was headed out
to be with friends, still without any disguise. Again, someone saw me
and shouted ""WHAT THE FUCK?"". I'm not a freak! I'm just another girl
on campus. Why can noone see this?

This isn't even counting the number of times someone has called me a
freak or something like that under their breath, thinking I can't hear
them. And the real tragedy is, this story is not over. This is still
happening. I still feel threatened whenever anyone sees me. I can only
really feel safe if I know I can't be seen. So, there isn't a green
eyed girl here. She doesn't exist. She doesn't try to hide as a green
eyed boy. Everyone knows that.

For the longest time, I couldn't get around the notion that anyone who wouldn't accept me as a girl was immediately hostile and had excluded from my life. As I went on, I saw more and more people excluded from my life, including my parents, my sister, some of my closest friends, even an old teacher of mine. I didn't have a job, was homeless, and was totally obsessed with this one notion of being accepted as Lynn and not Stephen. I remember one night replaying an episode of Bones in my head while sleeping in a car and got around to playing around with the idea that what if I was found dead in this car some weeks later....


Then it hit me. Bones would identify me as a male, based upon my skeletal structure, and Hodgins would confirm it with a DNA sample. Even in death I wouldn't be accepted as a girl. A thousand years could pass and all I'd be is a checkmark labeled ""male"" on the death report.

I cried, not so much for the fact of the story I played in my head, but because I had let this one thing get to me - that not everyone was going to accept who I was and I was going to have to be ok with that, and that I was the one who had to adapt, and that me forcing my new identity down the throats of others was the source of all my angst.

I called up my parents a day or two later. Told them I needed help, and that I was ok if they didn't accept me as a girl, but that I was going to go on with taking hormones and that one day when I could I was going to complete my change - but all of that doesn't matter and you can call me Stephen for as long as you like. I then told all my friends that as well. I told them all they could all have all the time in the world to accept me as a girl or not. I don't care about that anymore. 

I now have several groups of friends. Some call me Stephen, others call me Lynn. My immediate family, who has been wonderful to me, calls me StephenLynn - kinda affectionately - (though around some of the family its just Stephen).

Her initial response was that she couldn’t be with a lesbian, but after I told her that I felt more like a guy and that I didn’t consider myself gay, she started doing some research (having heard of GID on a television show a while back) and began sending me articles of the disorder. Reading those symptoms felt like reading out of a diary. It was a very conflicting moment in my life, because I was relieved that I knew what was “wrong” with me, but at the same time, I knew that I was going to start a very long journey to transition.
I’m 20 years old now, but I discovered this around the fall of 2007. At that time, and some time before that, I was seeing an endocrinologist for polycystic ovarian syndrome. They put me on birth control to fix my estrogen levels, but when I realized it was doing the opposite of what I wanted, I quit going there. I had just started high school and had no idea where to turn with this information. My step-father was in the military at the time, so we have military insurance(known for not being LGBT friendly). Our hospital was on a military base, so the awkwardness of going to the doctors while looking like a different gender was multiplied by the fact that it was a military hospital. 

The first person I told, my girlfriend aside, was my mother. My mom and I have always had a good relationship, and she has always been extremely supportive of me. She always assumed that I would be gay, because she noticed how tomboyish I was from an early age (didn’t like dolls, didn’t like girly clothes, and didn’t like long hair). She was very supportive and wanted to make sure that I knew what this entailed for me, and she also wanted me to know that even though she would support me, she and my step-father would be unable to do so financially in the long-run. 

I bided my time through highschool, unsure of exactly how to go about getting testosterone injections. I knew that in order to have surgery I needed to be diagnosed by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, so I told my mother that I wanted counseling. I was pretty depressed in middle school, and was getting extremely stressed out by trying to figure out what to do. I got permission to see a psychiatrist from my insurance, and when I explained everything to her, she told me that although she was very convinced that I had GID, we couldn’t put that down as the main reason for me seeing her, because my insurance didn’t cover it. We had to put depression. I stopped seeing her after a few months.

Time passed, I watched youtube videos and read a lot of forums on surgery types, costs, and different methods of hormonal treatment. As someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my testosterone levels were already higher than normal, so I had more facial/body hair, and my voice was slightly lower than most girls. I passed pretty well as a male just from face-to-face interaction, but my voice and breasts were what really gave me away. My sophomore year, I started wearing a binder. It wasn’t the best, as I have really large breasts (thanks mom) but it was better than the sports bras I was wearing. I figured that my name change was what I needed to do next. This was difficult because I was born in Germany, on an American base, and any change to my birth certificate would have to be done through an American Consulate. 

My senior year, I shortened my name from “Brittany” to “Brit.” I told some of my closer friends what I intended to do, but I knew that even after changing my name and starting to transition, it would be difficult because I was going to go to college in the same town that I graduated, which many of my classmates did as well. The end of senior year was tough, because they separated gown colors by gender, and females were required to wear a dress or skirt underneath their gown. I spoke to a very nice vice-principal privately and told her about my disorder, but our principal wouldn’t allow me to wear male colors and sit with the guys. I would, however, be allowed to wear shorts under my gown, and my name would be announced as “Brit _____,” and not my girly full first and middle name. 

Immediately following my graduation (June of 2011) I started my name change. I found a local attorney and I dropped $600 to have my name legally changed. I then had to deal with the long wait of processing through the American consulate after sending them documents mid-July of 2011. I had to return my birth certificate (which was a replacement of my original certificate that had been lost during my parents’ divorce), send in the legal name change papers, and pay $50 dollars to have a new one made. After two months of waiting, I was informed I would need a signed document from a notary verifying that it was a replacement birth certificate. 

I included a request to have my gender marker changed, and explained my situation. I was emailed and informed that in order to have the gender marker changed, I would need “a notarized physician’s letter that documents subject’s sexual reconstructive surgery that includes the following:
&gt; * Medial license or certificate number

&gt; * Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate

&gt; * Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to physician

&gt; * Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct. 

I was happy to learn exactly what I would need to do so in the future. I received this letter at the end of October, and it was already halfway through my first college semester. My name was still Brittany. I went and spoke directly to an executive in admissions at my college, and explained the situation. I told her that I really wanted my name changed because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would take before I received the paperwork, and that I felt uncomfortable with my name in my classes. She was very nice about and said she would see what she could do. She ended up changing my name in the system, and said that I would need to turn in the necessary documents as soon as possible (i.e., new driver’s license, new social security card, and new birth certificate). 

December rolled around and I finally got the paperwork from the American Consulate. Changing my drivers license was very easy, but I was nervous because I had heard that a lot of trans get flak from people at the DMV. I thought I would need my new birth certificate, but I found out that all I really needed was my legal name change documents (so I could have had my driver’s license changed since the summer… *facepalm*). Next was the social security office, and they asked for the legal name change paperwork, my new birth certificate, and my ID. That also went over very smoothly.

At the end of December, I decided to go and see my old Endocrinologist to see if there was anything they could do for me. I spoke to my doctor, told him that I have GID and that I wanted to start hormonal therapy, and if he knew of any place that I could go to because my insurance wouldn’t pay for it. My doctor said that they could take care of me, and that he actually had a few other patients who were trans that were being treated there. I was so relieved, and made an appointment for blood work, and then an injection. 

Although I pay out of pockets, my injections are kept off of the record from my insurance company and I have a $12 copay to have actual doctor visits. My injections are $39 per injection, but most of the price is a fee to have a nurse administer the injection (required by my Endocrinologist because of their company policy, it may be different for you). I get these twice a month and see my Endocrinologist once every 3-4 months.

My first injection was January 20th, 2012. Already having more testosterone than normal because of my POS, most of my changes happened quickly—within the first 3-5 months of being on testosterone. Some of the good things: my voice deepened pretty quickly, I noticed a steep increase in facial and body hair, and there’s definitely been an increase in libido, although I already had a pretty active sex drive before T. Some of the bad things: my acne got worse (again), and I get a lot more irritable and angry around injection time. 

Here’s a sample of how much my voice has changed (Sorry for the quality of the first one):

Here’s an example of my facial hair. I trimmed recently, so it usually looks fuller than this.

For obvious reasons I will not be naming names

Since I was 6, (as far as I can remember) I have always felt that something was wrong with me, I could not point my finger at it, but my brain for some odd reason kept saying I should have been a girl. At this point my family was living outside the U.S, and we were literally trapped in the case all day and night. We were not permitted to go outside, unless it was to help carry the groceries into the house, or go out on the backyard, and we were prohibited from contacting anyone outside of the house. My dad was a very religious person he was very much into the Christian bible (King James Version), but did not claim to be Christian, Jewish, or Jehovah Witness, apparently they all had it wrong. So he mashed together a combination of all three, and forced my mom to believe in his religion, and preached it to us since day 1 that we were born. I didn't know any better at the time; I thought he was telling the truth so it became hegemony for the family.

When I was 6, one morning I told some of my brothers and sisters that I wish I was born a girl. I said it out loud so everyone in the room heard it, and someone decided that it was a good idea to go and tell my dad. It was the worst punishment I got in my life; he took a belt and began to beat with it. He said I was possessed by the devil, and that I should not been thinking stuff like that. He was ""trying"" to beat the transgender out of me. After the beating my whole world shattered, and never said a word about it to anyone. I kept quiet about it, and I believed my dad and I prayed to ""God"" to try to ""cure"" me of this and I tried everything possible to forget about that idea, but it would always find its way back to me and hit me harder. I began to sneak around at night and go downstairs where no one was around (everyone slept on the 2nd floor), and deactivated the alarm and would sneak into the bathroom with some ""girly"" clothes to try on. I don't know why I would do it but it felt right.

When I was 15 years old, my sisters got out of the house while my dad was at work, and pressed charges against him for sexually molesting them. So my dad ran to the U.S and never returned back. I began to find low paying jobs and finally got a place of my own. It was until then that I began to question everything about my childhood. That’s when I realized the non-sense of religion and became an atheist. After losing the religion I began to also do research about gender dysphonia known as gender identity disorder (GID) at the time. I began to argue with myself whether transitioning would be the best option, and this caused a second personality to be created. After about a year I finally agreed to go ahead with the transition, and ended up breaking all the mirrors in my home because I did not want to see my reflection again. This also kind of stopped the second personality, but not entirely (I believe it will forever remain with me). After some research I knew that the best option I had was to move to the U.S to begin the transition.

My dad was a U.S citizen; however, my mom was not. My dad refused to claim us as his children so we could not receive our U.S Citizenship. The process took years and lots of money was wasted. During that time as we fought for our Citizenship I was growing more and more depressed about being transgendered, I wanted to have the transition done already. In 2011, the U.S Consulate finally gave in and gave us our U.S Passport. I began to sell everything and get ready to move out, and contacted a previous family my dad had in the U.S prior to us. A month later I got a plane ticket and with no second guessing myself. I stepped into the plane, I did not care what I would find in the U.S, and all I cared about was getting the transition started. When I arrived the family was very supportive, and eventually I ended up telling a part of the family I was staying with about my transgender issues. They promised to support me through the whole transition, but like a slap to the face they did a 180 on me and began to insult me in the most horrific ways. At the time I was already seeing a therapist, and she told me to grab my things and move out immediately. I tried to talk to the family to get them to stop insulting me, but I should have listened to my therapist from day 1.

In October 2011, I finally had enough and moved away. It was in that same month I found an affordable doctor that could prescribe me the hormones. In November 29th, 2012, I got started on HRT and I began to feel good about myself. Even if I am alone, at least I started my transition. I am tired of being abused, and insulted, for what I am. Is it really that hard to transition? and if so, does it get better overtime?. I can assure you this thou, if hell is real, I have been in it and I am barely stepping out of it. No child has to be tortured and lied to this much because the child was not what you wanted to have.

(If anyone asks, yes I have been crying the whole time when typing this. It is a very traumatic thing to remember, especially when that is all you have to say about your childhood.)

I had my first seizure (grand mal). A few weeks later I was diagnosed with epilepsy. This started a long hard process of finding the medication that worked. The side-effects of the high caliber medication gave me behavior issues. I was very violent, and at some points suicidal. I had to deal with this on top of school where I would have frequent brake downs of crying fits. My parents were with me 100% through out this horrible stage. They loved me regardless. I developed voices that I thought were normal. This medication trial deal lasted until I was 11. I continued to take the same medication for about 4 years. I was made fun of a school, and I had to go into the special education program for my issues. I fought against voices, and hallucination that I thought were normal. I could not communicated to my parents that I was having this issue, because I did not understand myself. There were multiple times where I tried to hurt myself, or my poor sister that was stuck in the cross-fire. It's horrible to think about today. This happened until I was 14. They took my off the medication after being seizure free for two years. I grew out of it, which I am extremely grateful for. I then picked up the pieces of the fallout. I battled depression for 2 years. I then became educated enough to describe my feelings. I knew that it was not normal to have voices, and sought out help. Today, I am 17.

I don't know what to do. I'm so confused, and scared.

I need to let out this frustration some how. I need to heard by someone.. I just need something to make it all good, or I don't know! Advice. Opinions.. whatever you have Reddit. I'm pouring my soul onto this website hoping for something great. I think that is more or less a new low.. but I don't care.

I just feel so helpless in my body. So uncomfortable. All the time. And I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this is poorly structured or worded or whatever. My thoughts are all over the place. I'm sorry.

I'm only 16 years old, but I feel as if I was born in the wrong body. People tell me I'm too young to know for sure, but I wish they would understand. As long as I can remember, I've wanted to be the opposite sex. But I can't come out. 

What happens if I say something? Will my friends not like me? Will my family make fun of me and abandon me? I'm so scared. It terrifies me. What if everyone I know leaves me because I want to be a woman?

I live in Georgia. The highly conservative and seemingly close-minded south. I'm just so scared. Everyone at school will make fun of me and call me names. When I look at myself now, it feels as if there's no way out of my situation. Both sides of my family are highly judgmental Roman Catholics. It feels like I'm just complaining, but I can't tell anyone what's wrong with me - even my own family. I'm too scared. My situation hurts. A lot. Every waking moment that I'm a man, it just pains me.. This isn't who I was meant to be. A lot of times, it just feels like the only way out is suicide. 

I wish I could talk to someone about it and let all my feelings out and cry. But I can't. Even as I tear up while writing this, I still won't be able to talk to a therapist or anyone. I'm too shy to meet new people. But I'm also too scared of what people think.

Please help me, r/transgender.. I don't know where I should start or what I should do.

It all just feels so scary and intimidating, but most of all, hopeless. I wish I could be who I really am. But I can't. I cry every time I think about it. The closest thing to feeling welcomed is this subreddit. It's the only thing that gets my hopes up. I've never posted here.

So uncomfortable. All the time. And I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this is poorly structured or worded or whatever. My thoughts are all over the place. I'm sorry.\n\nI'm only 16 years old, but I feel as if I was born in the wrong body. People tell me I'm too young to know for sure, but I wish they would understand. As long as I can remember, I've wanted to be the opposite sex. But I can't come out. \n\nWhat happens if I say something? Will my friends not like me? Will my family make fun of me and abandon me? I'm so scared. It terrifies me. What if everyone I know leaves me because I want to be a woman?\n\nI live in Georgia. The highly conservative and seemingly close-minded south. I'm just so scared. Everyone at school will make fun of me and call me names. When I look at myself now, it feels as if there's no way out of my situation. Both sides of my family are highly judgmental Roman Catholics. It feels like I'm just complaining, but I can't tell anyone what's wrong with me - even my own family. I'm too scared. My situation hurts. A lot. Every waking moment that I'm a man, it just pains me.. This isn't who I was meant to be. A lot of times, it just feels like the only way out is suicide. \n\nI wish I could talk to someone about it and let all my feelings out and cry. But I can't. Even as I tear up while writing this, I still won't be able to talk to a therapist or anyone. I'm too shy to meet new people. But I'm also too scared of what people think.\n\nPlease help me, r/transgender.. I don't know where I should start or what I should do.\n\nIt all just feels so scary and intimidating, but most of all, hopeless. I wish I could be who I really am. But I can't. I cry every time I think about it. The closest thing to feeling welcomed is this subreddit. It's the only thing that gets my hopes up. I've never posted here.

 I am not strong enough. I have thought about it for years. I have talked to people in all different stages of the processes. I have talked to personal friends. I've filled my mind with books and articles and blogs. I have soul-searched for the courage to transition, and I have found it missing.

It's too much to ask of me. I am a coward. I have seen the looks that are given to that which is not understood, the anger, the prejudice. I have heard the words of mockery and derision slung to people like us. I know which ones of those I love and hold dear would no longer be by my side and that, all alone, is too much to bear.
