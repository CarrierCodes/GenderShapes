And again, as I've mentioned before, there seems to be a common misconception that insurance companies rely on their cosmetic procedures exclusion clause to exclude trans surgery, which of course opens up medically necessary trans surgery to being compared to procedures like LASIK, like in this post:

http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/03/01/should-trans-surgery-be-covered-ctd/

What they're missing is, is that since 1979, if insurance companies try to rely on their cosmetic procedures exclusion clause to exclude trans surgery, then because of the medical necessity exception to that clause they may end up having to pay anyway, which is what recently happened in this case:

http://www.transgenderlegal.org/headline_show.php?id=384

As I've mentioned before, and as I've tweeted Andrew Sullivan, most insurance plans do not rely on the cosmetic procedures exclusion clause to ensure they do not have to pay for trans surgery.  Instead, what they rely on are categorical exclusions of trans surgery.  Some examples of those categorical exclusions can be found in the link below:

I'm someone that is struggling to find a way to get SRS.  I've noticed the American trans community does not really like to talk about the struggles, frustrations, and disappointment inherent to the American trans experience of trying to get medically necessary trans-related care, but they love to talk about the individual successes.  Some part of me thinks I have a shot, but even if I can change it I want to change the tenor of the discussion.  You see, when it comes to getting medically necessary care, things are bad, really really bad for most American trans people; just focusing on the positives and successes all the time misses the elephant in the room.

I think this tendency to focus only on the positive and to ignore the negative (no more how pertinent) is an inherently American one, so I expect to get fierce resistance in this discussion from many of the American posters here, but I'm not worried about it, because it needs to be said.  However, I think this tendency to ignore the negative may be part of the reason why things are so bad for the American trans community in this matter.

Basically, if I'm able to get SRS and if I talk about it, I'll get all these people going, Wow, great job!  Wow good for you! and all that good stuff, while someone who is really stuck in transition and can't afford it and who may be dealing with functional impairments (like those related to schizoaffective disorder) would just be left to wallow in despair, with nothing but silence out of their mouths.

I don't want to contribute to the problem mentioned in the linked article about of the voices of struggling trans people always getting ignored.  If reporters come to me about my experience of SRS, if and when I finally get it, I will talk about the trans woman with schizoaffective disorder.

Today at 4pm I came home after school and I showed him a picture of my room which I took with his camera. I use his camera more often than him and I also use this to take my cross-dressing pictures. After I showed him the picture of my room I deleted it whilst he was holding the camera. The next picture that popped up was a recent one of me in pantyhose and high heels... I tried to grab the camera out of his hands to delete the picture (I was so damn sure of I deleted it!) but it was too late. He asked me what I was wearing in that picture and I honestly said it were my pantyhose and heels. I asked where I got them and I replied honestly saying I got them about two years ago. He asked me right after whether I had feelings for girls or boys and I said I like girls (I'm pansexual but I think it's a little much to give him everything in one sitting, plus I like girls better and I haven't had any experiences with boys yet). I asked him whether he thought different of me and he said that he'd love me no matter what, to which he added that it isn't a simple situation I'm in, which I confirmed with a humming sound.

I asked him whether he had any questions and he said we'd talk tomorrow (we're the 6th of march '13 now). I hope he'll have questions which I can honestly answer and that we can figure a way out to make me on the outside as I feel on the inside.

Thank you all for reading, please share some experiences and/or advice.

2013-03-12 16:25:31,1a5jp1,0,1,"Hey, cutting to the chase here, this is a throwaway account because I'm not ready to come out with all this just yet.

I'm pretty much your classic case of 'girl trapped in a boy's body', only, I've just recently decided that I should do something about it.

I'm probably slightly androgynous in outlook anyway, and for the longest time, I've managed to convince myself that that was enough that I didn't REALLY need to do anything about it.

I've since come to realize that this isn't the case, settling for 'ok...I guess' isn't going to be enough for me when I know what I'm missing.

Anyway, my problem is that I'm afraid I've waited to long to take this seriously. I'm 29, which feels old, and I've allowed myself to get a bit too heavy. (I'm 184cm (6foot) and 117kg's (257 lbs)

Although I feel that with time, my face is definitely passable, I have the sort of physique where, if I lost some of the extra flab, you could hire me to play Superman. (not the Hulk, but still)

I've been working out a lot in the past couple of months, and I worry about whether hrt would impact my losing weight. Since Ideally, I'd like to drop a lot of weight, but obviously, losing the fat and then the muscle mass makes the most sense.

I guess I'm just worried that with current technology, I'm just never going to get any sort of end result that I'd be happy with.

I've got a consultation with a doctor specializing in gender dysphoria next week, so after that I'll have way more information, but still, I wanted to get some information from people in a similar situation.

Unsure, but I think they're closing down soon. So it's good to go there and get one while you can :)
