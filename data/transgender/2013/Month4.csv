2013-04-02 00:44:15,1bhasb,0,1,"Hello r/Transgender lurkers and posters, 

After many years of questioning, confusion, feeling around, and pondering, I've come to terms with the fact that I am male and my body is female.  

But I now have many questions. I'm already seeing a therapist and I will be going to a support group on Wednesdays. 

A little background: I'm 24, bisexual, married then divorced, currently in a relationship with a cisgendered man that knows the situation and is working out his own feelings on it--he and his family have also been very supportive, but he wants a wife, not a husband. We are in a fairly committed relationship (LDR, 3 years). I'm in college, graduating in the fall. I have a cat and a dog (unrelated). 

The feelings are hard to talk about, but I'm starting to be able to voice them. It's very difficult to express my thoughts in a way that's coherent to those that might not understand what it's like. Right now everything feels rocky. I'm not depressed but I am very disquieted. I don't know what my future as an individual will look like. I don't know how far I want to transition. 

I know I'm not alone. I'm not suicidal or depressed. 

The only things I have done so far are: my hair is now short and I slap some product on it in the morning, I dress in more gender neutral clothing. I have resolved to purchase a binder, though I have no idea from where, how, or how much. I will also be seeing a specialist in the near future to get my hormones and self tested to see just where on the physical spectrum I fall. 

Though the support group will likely help answer these questions, I want to try to talk to as many people as I can  and get different perspectives. 

**TLDR:** I'm a trans male, no hormones, currently presenting as female/gender neutral and wanting to present as gender neutral/male. I need advice and suggestions about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness given my circumstances.

He said he will probably get a full sex change operation soon.  I support him 100% but I think my parents will have a hard time with it--we were all on vacation this weekend and my parents kept telling me how he is ""going through a phase"" (since they know he wears makeup and tight pants etc).  They're not going to disown him or anything but it will be very hard for them, and he doesn't want to tell them for a while.

What can I do to support him?  What kinds of risks is he looking at with hormones?  Any resources I can use to educate myself about this?

Also part of me feels that he should tell them before starting hormones.  I respect that it is a HUGE decision to come out and really he is the only one who knows when he's ready, but I think they might feel hurt that he started his transition without telling them.

I couldn't believe that an organization that states ""Working for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Equal Rights"" didn't seem to care about Transgendered rights during that event. I have heard that the HRC has issued an apology, but I just do not understand why the request to remove the flag by other members, who I would presume are there to fight for rights OF ALL, ever happened in the first place.
