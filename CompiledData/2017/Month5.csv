The idea is simple: gather as much information as I possibly can on how you feel/think and create advertisement, as well as new products, that can adequately represent you.

I'm really trying to make a product that actually portrays non-binary people and helps society question the gender-binary culture, so if you could answer any of these questions you'd be helping a lot with my research! 

Anyways, here are the questions:

1. How do you feel when someone talks to you using a pronoun that doesn't represent you (""he"", ""she"", etc.)? In what way you would like to be addressed?
2. What are the biggest difficulties you face day-to-day?
3. When were your first introduced to the non-binary community? What grabbed your attention and made you research more about?
4. In your opinion, do you think the LGBT movement helps the non-binary community?
5. What is your opinion on how advertisement represents the community? Would like to see non-binary advertisement more often?
6. How do you feel when purchasing objects advertised to specific genders, such as clothes and personal hygiene products?

I'm also afraid my MIs (CPTSD and BPD) are making me think I relate to identities that I'm actually not.

I wrote a long post somewhere else but got insecure and took it down so here's kind of a brief summary... I'm afab and like (androgynous leaning) female fashion, makeup, etc. I desperately want to be considered conventionally attractive.

I also (maybe because of my lifelong abuse and trauma) never felt like I fit in with other girls or women. Sometimes I feel like cis women are living a totally different life than I am (except maybe rn I'm just being a whiny cis woman lol if so I apologize.) I've never really had a close female friend. Whenever I'm around other women/female friends I feel uncomfortable and like I'm missing something and don't work properly as a ""woman"". Oh, and I don't really feel comfortable applying the words ""woman"" or ""girl"" to myself. I hate having ""good girl"" said to me but I like ""good boy"". When I have stuffed animals I always call them by male pronouns.

But I don't really feel like a guy either. I was neglected by my father, bullied by my brother and abused by an older man. I'm afraid of men. But my closest friends in life (ie the people I've felt most comfortable around) have been androgynous or feminine leaning men.  

I used to say I wouldn't mind being reborn as a boy but now I don't really feel much of either. It would be really nice if the world suddenly became genderless and everyone were somewhere in between, because those are the people I'm most comfortable around. I wouldn't feel comfortable asking for non-gendered pronouns but I think it'd be nice if they were just implemented for everyone. 

I definitely feel like I'm in my own awkward not-real-woman corner, just a person. I definitely don't want to identify as ""both man and woman"", more like neither. Except I still like feminine (somewhat, more androgynous is better) fashion, makeup, and care a lot about becoming ""prettier"". 

What am I? If the answer is just a cis woman who needs to stfu, please let me know gently.

Suffice it to say, I'm afab, have more or less identified as a woman my whole life probably mostly because it never occurred to me I could be anything else, then in recent years felt more and more distant from my assigned gender. I've never felt like a guy, but I often don't feel like a woman, either. I think I fluctuate between female and, like, neutral.  So there's that. 

Thing is, I'm fine with she/her pronouns, I'm okay with my name (it's a gendered name for sure), and about half the time I dress pretty femme. So I've never really felt a need to ""come out"" as NB or anything. I don't have dysphoria, I don't think. At the most I feel kind of apathetic towards like my body and how people gender me.

I recently started a new job where I have to dress more professionally, and have entered a world of frustration with women's office wear being dumb but being too small to fit into men's clothes and uhg, so that's a whole thing. I normally prefer to dress pretty casual because it feels more neutral to me to just wear tees and jeans. I guess it's triggered like...an examination of my gender, along with some discomfort. I've been thinking about it all the time and reading on here and r/genderqueer and googling things. And I've been watching Kaitlyn Alexander's videos on YouTube (bless them), and can't decide if I have a giant crush on them or just want to be them. Ahaha. 

Another thing is that I've been kind of referring to myself in my head as NB/gender fluid for maybe a week or two and honestly I really like those feels. When it occurred to me that I didn't actually need to make a big outward change this revelation around (flashback to the billion other times/ways I've ""come out"" in my life), it started feeling like this kind of cool personal thing I don't have to share. Like, for the first time I'm taking control of my gender internally rather than letting people's assumptions define me. I don't do that for anything else, why should I do it for gender?

But I don't know. I've been feeling some kind of way about my gender, sometimes happy and sometimes confused and sometimes frustrated, but don't know if it...changes anything, exactly. I talk to bae about it a lot and she told me something I somehow hadn't learned in almost two years of dating, which is that she came out a few years back as just her - not a man or a woman, just her name. She's super laid back about gender and only gets bothered when people aggressively/rudely assume she's a she. And I kind of feel the same except I also have this, like, need to address it in some way. But I also don't want to make a big deal about it. Maybe it's more of an internal thing for me. But...like...gah.

I also don't want to be one of those cis people who just dislikes gender norms and conflates being a different gender with just defying expectations of their expected gender. Like, do I not want to be a woman, or am I not actually a woman? I feel more like it's the latter I'm just not sure. I don't want to take up space that isn't mine to take.

Guess I was gonna rant anyway. Oops.

TL;DR: I've been reconsidering my gender but am also sort of okay with the box I get put in, and don't know how to feel about that or what, if anything, to do.

49,2017-05-16 23:00:44,6bkwlj,7,11,"TL;DR: what are some key things to say when coming out as nonbinary to people of all kinds, including people who don't know about nonbinary (or maybe even binary trans people)

I really want to come out and hopefully it'll get rid of some of my fears of dressing how I want as well as the discomfort of my birth name and male pronouns but I'm not really sure how to? I have a lot of family to come out to, I was thinking of posting in our family whatsapp (which is most of the close people) but I'm not sure what to say. My mum told some of them I'm trans ages ago but my mum isn't really aware I'm nonbinary (because 1. I accepted it more so after I already came out and 2. I didn't know how to explain it). I also want to come out on Facebook and make a new profile but at the same time I don't really like Facebook. I also can't take a picture of myself that I like (although when I get my haircut it might be different)

I feel like I should message my grandparents and tell them rather than let them find out through facebook but they're not in the whatsapp chat and it feels really intimidating to message them 1 to 1.

Lastly I don't really know how to word it or how much to say. With my parents I wrote a long letter but that made sense because they're my parents but with slightly further family to random people I used to go to school with I'm not sure what kind of etiquette to go for. I feel like saying ""I'm nonbinary, they/them pronouns and my name is now Elise"" is a bit too short and less sincere but I don't think most of them want to see me spill my life story on Facebook.

The goal has been to change my body to become more neutral-toward-feminine, and I've had some success with that (some breast development, erections very rare, body hair thinning and hope it thins more).  I feel good on the 4mg daily, though I'd be happier if I had more sex drive and stronger fingernails.  I've done all this through private ""civilian"" physicians.  My most recent estradiol level was 212.3 pg/ml.  I do not consider myself ""finished"" with physical transitioning, and I eventually want further bottom surgery once I lose enough weight to get it done.

matabolism and theoretically lowering iatrogenic DVT risk. Will still require screening mammograms every 2 years (is a generally recommended frequency).""

71,2017-05-25 17:15:32,6db0zw,2,3,"Hello! I'm amab, non-binary, and 19. I'm looking for opinions and advice about how much I should tone down my presentation while taking the subway back and forth to my classes this summer. 

A little bit of background, I go to a very liberal art college where I feel pretty safe presenting however I want to. I also live in a pretty liberal area as well. I've been out and presenting as my queer self for a while, and i've been on HRT for eight months now. It's to the point now where unless I take steps to hide my breasts I look visibly trans. This works for me on a personal level, because I'm non-binary and my ideal presentation is a pretty inherently queer one. I've been able to present this way because I lived in the dorm at my school, and the dorm is right across the street from my classes, so I never felt particularly vulnerable. I dress pretty feminine or androgynous most of the time, often with makeup, skirts or cute socks and things, though mostly I just wear whatever I feel like at the time.

When I needed to go out on my own to other places on errands and such I would just dress normatively. However, this summer I'm back home and I'm taking summer classes a few times a week for about a month. I have to ride the subway for a fair ways in order to get to my school. I'm really worried about being harassed or targeted for being visibly trans on public transportation. It doesn't help that I also have pretty bad anxiety, and public transport completely terrifies me on it's own even without the added stress of being trans.

 I've gotten used to being able to express myself openly at school. While I know that's a huge privilege, I really don't want to go back to hiding my real self. I also would have to stop painting my nails for a whole month while going to classes, and having that fear interfere with my presentation in my normal personal life sucks. Toning down my presentation doesn't erase my queerness. But because I have anxiety my presentation is often the only way I can make myself visible and express myself to other people, and it's also one of the few things that gives me confidence in social situations. Plus it just hurts every time people gender me as male. Trying to ""Pass"" in public as female would be closer to my desired presentation than my assigned gender is, but I don't know if I could, and I've never really attempted it.

So what do you people think? Should I dress completely as my assigned gender on the train, or should I just present how I want anyway, or is there a viable compromise between expression and safety. It's really hard for me to decide because a combination of my anxiety, and inexperience presenting in completely public spaces prevents me from realistically assessing the situation.

tl;dr - I'm amab and present pretty feminine. I used to be close to my college classes, but now I have to take the train and I'm worried about safety with how I present.

8,2017-05-06 06:19:39,69jtak,6,16,"I guess this is just a random dump of my recent experiences. Just for some background, I was cross dressing for all the events described in this post. Pretty much cross dressing every day at this point.

I went to a concert on Sunday night on a whim. I felt super uncomfortable when I was being patted down. I was afraid the guy was going to touch me somewhere inappropriate. He didn't, but I just realized I've never felt that way about my body before. I'm usually just annoyed that I'm being patted down.

There was a dude in line for the concert who had apparently drank too much too fast. He was pretty out of it. I offered to his girlfriend to get him some water, and she immediately hugged me. That felt good. :) I bought ginger ale instead (because I thought it would help settle his stomach) from a shop across the street and brought it back to him. She thanked me and asked me for my name. I gave it to her (it's an androgynous name), and it seemed like she referred to me as a ""person"" to her boyfriend because she wasn't sure how I identified, which is fine with me. I intentionally picked an androgynous nickname a few months ago to gauge whether I pass or not. I may change it later, but right now I don't currently identify as female, just non-conforming male.

The bathroom situation is getting really uncomfortable. I'm still using the men's restroom, but one time I was throwing out my paper towel when some guy came in and looked noticably traumatized. I asked him if he was okay and he just gave me a weird face. I think I passed for a split second which is why he freaked out. Then I talked to him and threw a wrench into it with my voice. :|

I don't really feel comfortable using the urinals anymore, because I need to resituate everything every time I go and it's easier to do in the stall. Also I've just started wearing wired so I'm constantly having to fuss with my straps and positioning. I'm learning that if the wire comes up too high in the middle that it digs into my chest... Ouch. I've been nervous ever since the freak out guy that someone who is not from my company (it's a rental complex that my company owns 1 3/4 floors. My floor is the 3/4 one) would come into the bathroom right as I was coming out of the stall and I would surprise them.

My sister's graduation is coming up. I try to avoid cross dressing *too much* whenever family is around, which usually equates to wearing a less obvious bralette and a neutral top, but still wearing makeup and nail polish, women's pants, etc. I would really rather not have to jump through those hoops at all, because I feel like of all people I should feel comfortable around my family, but I actually feel more comfortable at work. I just don't want to upset them too much. Recently this has equated to not visiting family as much anymore.

Work has been... Interesting. I know one other Christian who is in support of me there. He's been really interested in getting my perspective on it, and has asked me really specific questions about whether I'm going to get surgery or not. He's been very clear that if I need any help that I can turn to him.

The really difficult thing is that there's a person I like at work, but I get the sense that because of what I'm doing to my identity, that makes me a turn off for them. We're very good friends though, and I've started to open up to her about everything, and she's been giving me advice here and there. She's not uncomfortable with me at all, which I really appreciate.

I have crushes on a few guys at work, but I don't feel driven to pursue them, because I personally feel that's wrong, and as I said to my counselor, ""I can appreciate a good looking guy but that doesn't mean I want to be in a relationship with one.""

Just recently, my boyfriend has come out as transgender. The last year has been a mess.. He was constantly angry with me and had mood flashs all the time with no proper explanation. He wasn't treating me nicely and I was always kind with him and did everything for him. I thought, that I was constantly annoying him and doing everything wrong. I spent hours crying and eating, not showing him my true emotions. This may sound naive, but I always subconsciously knew, that there was something else bugging him. Hence, I accepted his behavior.

I am very much in love with him and one day I would like to have a family with him. The first words I told him were: I am proud of you. I truly was! There was so much pressure off me. From this day on, there were no more fights and we were talking endlessly and there was a much closer bound between the two of us. It also turned out as something exciting and beautiful for me to discover his female side together with him. Today, I organised his first consultation meeting with a doctor for him, because he was afraid about the phone call. The only thing that is taking over me is: FEAR. I have no problem with him transitioning to a woman, (it may sounds stupid but I listened to my heart) but i have concerns:

How did you guys tell everyone about your transition? Is it true, that you can lose your sex drive? I am very concerned about this :( It makes a lot of sense to me, since the testosteron is diminishing. What about becoming parents one day? Is it true, that after a while you will be infertile? What about testicular atrophy? To which extent will his penis shrink? Artificial insemination seems so unnatural to me. I have always dreamed about being a mom, conceiving naturally. However, what in life really does occur in the way you imagined it?

I would appreciate your stories that would show me, that there is no need to be afraid. I never cared what people thought about me, as long as I was happy. Being in a relationship with a woman is something that I can imagine, since I am sexually attracted to them, but never had a relationship with one.

So dearest reddit community, please help me. I really appreciate it!

I spent hours crying and eating, not showing him my true emotions. This may sound naive, but I always subconsciously knew, that there was something else bugging him. Hence, I accepted his behavior.\n\nI am very much in love with him and one day I would like to have a family with him. The first words I told him were: I am proud of you. I truly was! There was so much pressure off me. From this day on, there were no more fights and we were talking endlessly and there was a much closer bound between the two of us. It also turned out as something exciting and beautiful for me to discover his female side together with him. Today, I organised his first consultation meeting with a doctor for him, because he was afraid about the phone call. The only thing that is taking over me is: FEAR. I have no problem with him transitioning to a woman, (it may sounds stupid but I listened to my heart) but i have concerns:\n\nHow did you guys tell everyone about your transition? Is it true, that you can lose your sex drive? I am very concerned about this :( It makes a lot of sense to me, since the testosteron is diminishing. What about becoming parents one day? Is it true, that after a while you will be infertile? What about testicular atrophy? To which extent will his penis shrink? Artificial insemination seems so unnatural to me. I have always dreamed about being a mom, conceiving naturally. However, what in life really does occur in the way you imagined it?\n\nI would appreciate your stories that would show me, that there is no need to be afraid. I never cared what people thought about me, as long as I was happy. Being in a relationship with a woman is something that I can imagine, since I am sexually attracted to them, but never had a relationship with one.\n\nSo dearest reddit community, please help me. I really appreciate it!\n"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My boyfriend came out as transgender - love knows no gender', 'created': 1494551370.0}"

Not doing dresses or any outer clothing types that are traditionally female only, just jeans, dress pants, sweaters, T-shirts, etc. I don't really pass yet (and maybe I never will), but I'm confident enough that I don't care as much anymore. I don't mind the double takes and up-down looks I get from some people (I actually enjoy them), but sometimes I'll get a *really* nasty look from some people, and that causes me to get anxious. I still don't identify as female, and I'm still not sure about that. I've had another Redditor try to tell me that I'm a trans woman in denial. I wonder if it's that or if I'm a queer who's taking things farther than they really want to go.

I'm concerned that I've kind of forced myself to head down this path without seriously considering what I want, and whether I want to lose my existing friends over it. Some people have called me miss and ma'am recently, and I just have kind of let it happen. It did get me a little excited though. I was in Goodwill the other day shopping for more women's clothes and I forgot to use the restroom before I left work. I rushed into the women's without even thinking about it. It was a standalone, so it didn't really matter that much anyway...

I originally started cross dressing because a friend had helpfully pointed out, ""how do people expect to improve if they can't make mistakes?"" I started then and haven't really stopped. I felt really uncomfortable at first, but it's getting better, and I do like the way I look. The only circumstances I don't dress up as much are when I'm with family, because I don't want to upset them. Also I try to avoid meeting them in casual settings anymore, and since I don't have any dresses that means I'm wearing a suit, which I hate.

I'm actually pretty excited that I can fit some bras semi properly now, but now every time I sneeze I can feel it in my nips. 😯 I guess that's normal? It's a nice sensation but really distracting. I dislike that my leg hair is taking so long to go away. I've tried waxing before, and got a pretty good result in my lower arms, but it's starting to come back now. I think my spiro is too low. Hopefully it can be increased after my next blood test.

My family knows the name I've picked for myself (at least for now. It's not terribly feminine so I might change it sometime soon) and has implicitly rejected it, even though it's androgynous, and even though I explained to them that I had picked it because my birth name is really common at my workplace and in the world, which isn't a lie, but also not the whole truth. I haven't really pressed the issue, but I've changed it on Facebook, so they're aware of it.

I went to my old church today for a get together, to catch up with some friends there and play volleyball. The church isn't trans friendly at all, which was part of the reason I left, since the pastor seemed to be railing on the issue every few weeks. (I wasn't out at the time, but was taking hormones.) Mostly everyone treated me nice, but I kind of felt like they were taking pity on me. That could just be my warped perspective though. I was never good at reading people, and I was kind of depressed, so maybe they were just noticing that. Or maybe I was just projecting how I thought they would feel onto them.

26,2017-05-15 05:58:46,6b8oyu,4,15,"Tl,dr; so far, so good

Hi everyone,

I'm right at the beginning of this whole thing, and while I've always felt like I wasn't normal, not really relating to men, feeling more comfortable with women, not having a real sense of gender identity, for the last few months I've been feeling really dysphoric, and really euphoric when thinking of myself as my preferred gender. 

I'm married, and receiving treatment for depression anyways, so brought up how I'm feeling with my doctor who doesn't know anything about dysphoria but seems really supportive. I've had a bunch of fights with my wife, but I think we're going to go through this together - fingers crossed. I decided to tell my parents about how I'm feeling, as a kind of heads-up about what I'm going through - my mom was unconditionally supportive, and even tried to stop using gendered words on the phone, which was really sweet :) it just came to a head and I needed to get it out. She told my dad, who I've not spoken to yet, and I'm a little scared of that conversation but I think there are going to be a lot of scary comversations going forward. I'm not convinced I am trans, yet, because apparently it could be a side effect of my medication, maybe? Or something? In any case, I don't know what's going on yet and I'm going to get hold of someone locally I can talk to to help sort through all of this stuff.

I'm not talking about the fat everybody has there, this is left over breast tissue and it's obvious and doesn't look right.

I also have a little bit of extra skin. I can pull my nipples like 2 inches from my chest, because the skin in that area, I just think he left too much. I don't want additional scars though, so if it's not something that can be corrected by going over my already-existing scars or around my nipples, then I guess I'm stuck with it lol

Have any of you guys dealt with this? There's no way I could get the revisions now because I don't have the money for the fees and travel to CA and staying there, etc. But I'm afraid if I wait a year or more he will say it's been too long and it's not his fault etc. Is it a good idea to email him now with pictures and discuss it then come back to it when it's financially doable?

Have any of you specifically had surgery with Satterwhite and then gone back to him for revisions? How does he stand behind his work? I remember him being a really nice guy when I met him, but I'd just like to hear as many experiences with this as possible

I can pull my nipples like 2 inches from my chest, because the skin in that area, I just think he left too much. I don't want additional scars though, so if it's not something that can be corrected by going over my already-existing scars or around my nipples, then I guess I'm stuck with it lol\n\nHave any of you guys dealt with this? There's no way I could get the revisions now because I don't have the money for the fees and travel to CA and staying there, etc. But I'm afraid if I wait a year or more he will say it's been too long and it's not his fault etc. Is it a good idea to email him now with pictures and discuss it then come back to it when it's financially doable?\n\nHave any of you specifically had surgery with Satterwhite and then gone back to him for revisions? How does he stand behind his work? I remember him being a really nice guy when I met him, but I'd just like to hear as many experiences with this as possible\n\nThanks!"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Top surgery revision questions (x-posted to /r/ftm)', 'created': 1495055975.0}"

Quick story short, I'm 26, born male. Since I was 8, for various reasons, I kept on thinking and **feeling** that I was actually a girl inside a boy's body. But I had no dysphoria whatsoever. To this day, I still have no dysphoria. I just felt like I was a girl who, born in the wrong body, just managed to accept it and lived meeting societal expectations of my biological sex.


With the help of my awesome girlfriend, after many years, I managed to understand that I'm not a girl, nor a boy, but something of a mix of the two. What I could gater about androgyny really clicked with me and makes me feel at peace. Sadly, my native language(spanish) has no gender neutral words or pronouns, and is heavily gendered. So, just my girlfriend and a bunch of my closest friends know what I am, as I keep on presenting as male. It's just less of a hassle, and after all, I'm at least *part* male anyway.


I come to you asking for advice. In spanish, words end up either in O for male and A for female. I thought the @ symbol would fit perfectly (as it kind of looks like an A inside an O, which would represent me perfectly), but I'm too anxious to just start using it, even in chat with the ones that know that I'm androgynous and support me...


Also, I'd like to know what I can do about my appearance to look more femenine and/or more blurry between male or female.

I inject Estradiol Valerate and I take Cyproterone acetate. 

Am a bit worried. Don't know if I should inform my doctor.

57,2017-05-29 12:28:15,6e004n,4,20,"I'm planning on coming out to my mom sometime this Summer and I've been struggling over how to do it. I realized I can express myself better if I write it all out, so here it is:

""It's hard to even know where to start with something like this, so I'll just come right out with it: I'm transgender.

I can already hear your response in my head-- your skepticism, your arguments. 

""People like that realize when they're young.""  
""But you never did [insert stereotypical behavior here].""
""You do plenty of masculine things!""

I know. It's not an easy thing to come to terms with and it certainly wasn't easy for me, but I need you to. I have enough doubts for the two of us and then some, so while I struggle to figure this all out and find myself what I need from you is just acceptance and understanding.

This aspect of myself is something I've known about since elementary school, though I didn't have the context or understanding to make sense of it at the time. I wonder if you remember that time you found a lost earring and one of those fake stick on nails that I had collected from school and hidden behind my shelf. You asked me why and I, red-faced, could only stammer that I didn't know. This was no lie, I truly did not know, it was simply a compulsion. I saw these 'feminine' objects and was inexplicably drawn to them.

I've contemplated and struggled with this more actively for about ten years now. Along with many other people like me, it became more apparent and inescapable around puberty. Since the time I started to develop an attraction to girls, my fantasies have almost invariably involved imagining myself as a girl, and when I saw someone I found attractive, my feelings were not simply a matter of attraction but also of jealousy. I have always been overly fixated on their clothing, their makeup, their femininity, because I wanted that for myself. Movies or TV shows where a male and female character switch bodies have always particularly fascinated me, and now I know why. I would often dream of some magical being from one of my video games casting a spell and transforming me into a beautiful girl. I don't want to go into more sordid details, but suffice it to say that these feelings continued into and throughout high school.

I have always been insecure about my masculinity, as you well know. My height, my size, my facial hair and other features, my stoicism-- there was not a single day as far back as I can remember where I didn't have these things on my mind, gnawing at me. Even as many of these characteristics improved, my insecurity surrounding them only grew. How could I ever be secure in something which doesn't suit me, some Platonic masculine ideal I could never and would never achieve. I wanted these things because I had learned that these are the traits which make a man, but it was merely an illusion. I have been hiding behind a facade of masculinity for so long that it will take a long time to become acquainted with an identity I never allowed to properly develop. I'm sure living with someone as hyper-masculine and closed minded as dad didn't help. In the past few weeks even as I was terribly anxious over exams and horribly conflicted about this issue, something changed abruptly. These insecurities disappeared almost like flipping a switch and for the first time in over a decade, I have developed some semblance of peace in this respect. I'm obviously still dissatisfied with my body, no surprise given my situation, but the insecurities of masculinity which have dominated my consciousness in public and private for so long have finally eased.

The past few months have truly been a special kind of hell. As studying proceeded on schedule and my anxiety improved with medication but still lingered, there was nothing left to hide behind anymore. I was finally forced to confront this spectre of distress and discomfort which accompanies me everywhere, and has for so long. I had considered this explanation before, but I always figured these feelings were just some odd sexual desire and the sense of shame which might accompany it. The reality though is that people who aren't trans don't constantly imagine themselves as women regardless of their sexual interests. I'm also not ashamed about how I feel, I'm not ashamed of any of these things. I am who I am and there is no point in fighting it. What I really feared was the disapproval of others-- not of society at large, but of the people whom I care about. You wonder why I avoided talking to you about my anxieties, why I lied and told you I was fine when I wasn't. How could I explain something like this? I didn't even understand or accept it myself until recently. 

The timing with my exams was certainly unfortunate, but life seems to have a way of throwing things at you when it's most inconvenient. Imagine how hard it has been to focus on my final preparations and indeed on the exams themselves with all this on my mind, along with legitimately being mentally exhausted from the endless cycle of stress, revision, and exams. So after tons of reading (as you know I always do), after speaking to others like me, and after much agonizing contemplation, this was the inescapable conclusion. Hopefully you can come to accept this, even if it takes some time. I can only imagine that it's hard to lose a son, or at least your perception of the person you think you've come to know, but it's still me-- the parts of me that matter anyway. You've sometimes wished you had a daughter, right? Well now you can. That feels so weird to say, and I think it probably will for quite a while, but it's the truth.

This also provides some context for my depression and anxiety issues. I'm sure I'm predisposed anyway, but their persistence is telling. Even at my best points while being treated, even during times when I've truly had nothing on my mind, a relentless nagging discomfort has been present. It has pervaded my every waking moment for so long that I don't know what it feels like to simply be content and happy. Things which bring me joy are always accompanied by a voice in the back of my mind that makes it feel wrong... I've become so accustomed to stress and fear that I feel bad even about feeling good. Well I deserve to be happy. I deserve to find peace. If I don't embrace this, I don't know that I ever will.

Oh and one last thing, please don't worry about what my friends might think. I have always surrounded myself with tolerant and open-minded people because I find the ones who think like dad to be repulsive. All the ones who matter to me know at this point, and none have been anything less than fully supportive and accepting.

I feel emotions very intensely and I often struggle to express or process them in healthy ways.  I'm convinced that my difficulty with crying is a combination of both social factors and hormonal factors.  When I have cried in public, sometimes people have comforted me but a few times I've had adults condemn or criticize me, or react angrily, a reaction I rarely see directed at women.  I also grew up in a fairly traditional environment with a moderate dose of stereotypical toxic masculinity.

I also though have read about, and talked to people about experiences with hormonal transition, and people say it's definitely easier to cry with a female hormonal profile than a male one.  But I know men and other people with a male hormone profile can cry...my high school band director would cry all the time, in public, and I really liked him and admired how he could do that.  He'd get emotional about music, and also about his students, he cared so much for his students.

I'm not interested in HRT though for a wide variety of reasons, but this is one particular thing that I'd like to work on, because, for me, crying is often a really healthy and positive way for me to process my emotions, especially negative emotions.  I nearly always feel a kind of release after doing it.  I feel more calm and loving, and tend to think more rationally and positively after crying, which is one reason I really like it.

So far the most reliable thing I've found to help me cry is music.  Certain songs often (but not always) make me cry.  It's not super reliable though, and also not always available in every situation. I want to find some other ways of helping me cry when I want to.

I'd be curious to hear from any other AMAB people, or perhaps AFAB people who have gone on T too, or anyone really who has experienced the feeling of wanting to cry but not being able to.

So, a personal thought battle has been bouncing in my head: and I genderqueer, or am I a gender non-confirming man?

I used to be adamant about that, saying I was still a cisgendered man, as I took on more femme qualities. I wanted to make a point that ""man"" was arbitrary, and it doesn't mean I *had* to be a certain way. What I hate the most is male gender roles: the expectations, the ""supposed to's."" I ""didn't want to"" be genderqueer, because I felt like that was ""giving up,"" and admitting that because of my preferred form of expression, I was not a man; that a man *is* this certain set of traits and gender roles.

Now, I reflect, and feel a bit uncomfortable with the term ""man"" (but not ""boy?""), as well as ""woman.""

I guess what I should just get to is the questions I'd like to ask other people:

If you're gender nonconforming, but not genderqueer, why don't you feel genderqueer?

Vice versa?

And what I would be very interested in hearing is gender nonconforming trans people: e.g., butch transwomen and femme transmen. What is it that makes you sure you're a gender different from you were assigned at birth, yet maintain traits of that gender?

I grew up Mormon smack in the middle of Utah Valley.

When I was about 11, I knew something was ""off"".
At 13 I was convincing myself I was ""just bisexual"" (I am aware of exactly how problematic that statement is) and that I'd get over it and still get a wife and kids and live out the dream.
At 16, I knew I was gay and came out to some close friends.
At 18, I came out to my parents, both of whom were worried, but supportive.

I'm 24 now. I've been a hobbyist sfx artist for two years, and a social dancer for 6 years. Last weekend I went out in the most ""femme"" styling I've ever done. Took my makeup skills and attempted some beauty makeup, I got m'self some heels, and I went dancing.

I've identified as a cis male for my entire life, even with all of my sexual questioning. Even now I consider myself solidly content with my born gender, but when I started to push at these norms I grew up with... when I said ""fuck it"" and put on eye shadow, lipstick and heels, I don't think I've ever felt such a rush of excitement and relief all at the same time.

Here's to hoping more lines are blurred, more barriers are broken down, and through the crumbling of oppressive societal norms, we can enjoy each other for the spectrums that we are.

52,2017-05-11 20:55:58,6amxt4,2,11,"(Edited to fix spelling mistakes x.x) Sorry for the long post.. But it's frustrating.

So for the past two years or so I've been frustrated and confused with my gender.  I didn't really think about it much before, but even when I was a teenager I felt like I was somewhere in between rather than being female or male. I *think* I'm non-binary but to be honest I'm not sure!

My parents are completely dismissive if I bring this up and think that my only 'issue' is not liking traditionally feminine things... Which may be true. I honestly don't know. I was AFAB and I think women are amazing and there's no real way to 'do' being a woman. But at the same time, I'm so tired of this gender binary. I feel that I can't say that I fit the female label without lying to myself, but I also feel like a fake when trying to fit the genderqueer label.

I've been using a chest binder and wearing suits and ties at work. Everyone at work uses she/her as pronouns for me because I'm not ""out"" - I'm so scared of them thinking I'm weird, and those pronouns don't bother me that much although I think I'd be happier if I was brave enough to tell people to use ""they"". What does bother me is that most of the time strangers also gender me as female no matter how hard I try to present more masculine. It's really weird saying that as an enby person, but I'm far more satisfied when people gender me male because it feels like at the very least my different presentation is working. I think my proudest moment was when someone I'd just met referred to me as ""this man"" to someone else, and she said ""that's a woman""  - they were maybe both wrong but that was probably my peak enby moment!

But at this stage, I don't know what to do. I want to present ""more enby"" I think, but I have all the good things fat AFAB women have (breasts and a butt). As I mentioned I have a binder and plenty of men's clothes. I was wondering, do I maybe need a smaller/tighter fitting binder? Or maybe a bigger one? Not sure which one would be better, but I feel like my ""girls"" aren't properly compressed. Another thing that bothers me is that I don't think I have my gender identity completely sorted out, either. I definitely don't think I'm trans male, but on the other hand I can't explain why I like the masc presentation so much. And I still think that it's possible that I'm a cis woman and this is all in my head or 'a phase'... So confused!

I appear very cis-female but inside I feel neutral. I'm not looking for advice, just want to throw around my thoughts**

First example - mom continues to get excited about including me in female-oriented situations like wedding/baby shower parties. The last time I went to one in high school I had a hard time enjoying myself because the booze was light and the conversation was overwhelming. At the time, I thought I couldn't handle it because of my introversion. But instead, I found out that women tend to get excited and talk about stuff that I just don't talk about.

Second example - I gather information about others and report in a relatively genderqueer way. Women want to know family and background details where men tend to prefer to stick to the current story in the discussion. I always get a variety of information, leading me to tell lengthy stories. It is also my personality to get really wordy and paint a mural almost forgetting the point of it all.

Third example - social expectation is that I am in a straight marriage, that we had a real wedding, want a house and are planning on babies. The reality is that the wedding was 4 minutes long at city hall so I could get 15k in grants from the government for school since I had no help from parents and their income didn't help things with FAFSA help. The reality is that I want to steal others' children, squeeze my kitty, and solidify being child-free for the rest of my life. While those are mostly based on my personality, my marriage is super gay and nontraditional. We still act like best friends who also hold the most intimacy with each other. As far as gender is concerned, I don't see his gender but respect that he is a cis-dude and he thinks it's cute and awesome that I now steal his jeans after hitting a weight loss goal. It always bothers us when people treat us like a typical hetero-norm couple and I have been upset by sexist remarks from his family that try to force me back into some pretty princess gender role. (I'll fucking push the car out of a ditch in a wool skirt if I damn want to!)

**What I've learned, how I cope, and where I'm at right now socially:**

I'm able to let it go now or speak up when someone assumes that my actions or reactions will be more typically female. It's interesting to watch people try to figure out why I respond in a more masculine way sometimes. Does not compute.

After coming out as bisexual/queer, minimalist, in a non-traditional 'marriage,' child-free, polyamorous, white Latina, and all the other weird things about me, I am pretty comfortable adding another concept to the pile, especially with the people I am close to.

But when I interact with people who don't know me, I am comfortable taking the time to explain why I am not as predictable. There are also people who want to analyze me, feel like they need to know everything in order to treat me 'correctly' or think that I am very insecure about who I am.

I am not insecure and yet sometimes I am insecure. The complications of human identity clash horrendously with the American individualization we are taught (which encourages fear and consumption). This is also something I am working on accepting.

I expect my NMom will spout off that it's silly/can't change/etc. or be supportive with the ulterior motive of renewing a relationship that never truly existed in the first place. I know a few family members will oppose it silently and my grandmother will bring up Jesus, which is going to be upsetting because I was so close to her growing up.

So I work for a mental health NHS trust. I recently took up a post in the children's hospital and met someone who came out as gay then genderqueer and works as a psychotherapist. There are also several trans children who are service users at our trust who are under the Gender Identity Development Service too.

So I decided after discussing it with my colleague and my partner to get a referral to the Gender Identity Clinic now run by the same NHS Trust as GIDS.

I wrote a post on Facebook after that, included all my family and friends but excluding my partner's family. So far, the response I've got is overwhelmingly positive but I think no one who opposes it would respond there given the support I've received.

I haven't chosen a great time to come out, I've recently switched from mirtazapine to sertraline and I'm only a few days in to the new medication.

They bounced back pretty well, but in my inspection the shoes, I found a label that had a size 10 and ""women"" written on it...I initially didn't think anything of it, since I know my size in ""women's"" Vans is 10. I then did a double take, my ""men's"" 8.5s are also labeled ""women's"" 10s.

But the thing is... I'm AFAB and present as femme. I just feel like I am not genderqueer enough. I would love to present more masc at times but my body is not suited for the androgynous look. I have always had some discomfort with my body regarding my lack of a penis (sorry TMI), but I actually am pretty okay with my ""feminine curves"" and think I look killer in a dress.

And I know gender presentation and gender identity are not the same thing, and if another AFAB femme-presenting GQ told me this, I would reassure them 100% that they are legitimate. But I just feel like people are going to think of me as ""queering cis-ness"" or something. Which I could hardly blame them for, especially since I am married to a cis male (though we are poly).

I guess up until now all of this has kind of made me push gender questioning to the back of my mind, and since I don't have a pronoun preference (I'd happily go by either she/her, they/them, or he/his) or any serious dysphoria, I just figured if I ignored it, it would go away.

BUT IT WON'T FUCKING GO AWAY.

I just today logged on to my old FetLife profile that I probably hadn't touched in years, and when I went to update my profile, I saw that it was already talking about exploring my gender identity. I have no idea why but it just made me start crying. 

I have had this same problem with my sexuality, being functionally pansexual (though I don't like using that term for myself) and married to a man, I'm not queer enough for the LGB crowd, and now thinking I'm genderqueer but since I present femme and don't have preferred pronouns I am not queer enough for the genderqueer community.

I was thinking about changing up my presentation just to see how it made me feel so if anybody has any tips on how a person with boobs (and I would rather not bind) and pretty thick thighs can pull off a more masc look I would appreciate it. I'm at least thinking of getting a more ""butch"" haircut and see how I like it (only thing is my MIL does my hair but that is a whole other cup o' drama).

I don't know. I'm sure society has conditioned me to feel safe presenting as femme, but I also don't want to present masc just to fit in with the queer community. How do you even figure out what is really YOU? There is so much pressure from every which way it seems impossible.

 hey so ive been super busy this week and didnt have time to follow the latest stuff on pwr bttm. but i looked into it again this morning and read a Jezebel article that i was linked to that detailed pwr bttms latest (crap) response. 

so i went to view the comments after and the first one was asking ""why a straight male would identify as queer"".  it was just really obviously a fishing terf thing, and the person turned out to be a gay man who continued to (purposefully) use male pronouns after being corrected and deny that bi people are different than straight. 

 all the other comments after seemed to be similar if not the same, and there seemed to be other people chiming in to talk about how ben was using drag to assault people. these were first because they were the highest voted comments.

the worst thing tho is that these were all comments that had been approved by a moderator as it clearly stated they were reviewed new comments.

i dont usually read Jezebel but they've been p central to this story. are they usually this terfy? its making me feel physically sick right now that they could think that letting people stir up truscum/ transphobic/ biphobic hate is acceptable to them.

As a child I never wanted to be adressed as a girl, but at times it infuriated me being adressed as a boy, too. During puberty it came in phases, that I would have prefered to be a boy.

I just at times felt more male then female, but wearing my hair short, knowing how to do convincing male make-up I was really fine. I settled for the term ""gender-fluid"", because I feel it discribes me best.

On my university people just were okay with it. I never properly came out, but people... Just seemed to adjust. Nobody ever mentioned it. So do people at my work place, where I have come out and... It really is not a big deal.

So generally I should be happy and all...

There is another side effect: My breasts grow due to the medication. And for the first time I really experience dysphoria. I have gained two, by now almost three entire cup sizes and not only is it hurting my back, it also makes me feel physically ill to just look at my chest. 

Before my breasts where really small and it did not take a lot to make my chest look male. In fact I found a way to rather easily make my chest look like a muscular male's. It was great. But now... They are big, they are ugly and I really want them to go away.

I basically had to sit in a class and learn from the lecturer and had to go into the same classes every day, so I got to be familiar with them. 
Anyway one of the classes was a total mess, they were all really disrespectful and it was full of racists and homophobes and generally not very nice people. They were all older than me and I'm 25, but they acted like children at school, talking badly to the lecturers, skipping class and generally doing a bunch of stupid immature stuff like arguing with each other and whatever.

So one day the lecturer who is actually very nice (and I felt sorry for her having to put up with all the shit), brings up genderqueer people, but she accidentally describes us as binary instead of non-binary. I mean, she tried lol. Kind of obvious if you actually know what the word binary means, but maybe she didn't.

104,2017-05-22 16:35:07,6coc7n,10,18,"I am 31, AMAB and from Ormskirk, West Lancashire, United Kingdom.

Although I am happy as a male, I have been interested in presenting androgynously lately and am uncertain if this counts as an example of genderfluidity [if not androgyny].

Basic information:

- I haven't felt that I've ever had gender dysphoria, but reading articles about androgyny/genderfluidity had made me realize it was OK to be androgynous.

- I have never really had gender issues growing up.
- My friends are mostly women and older men.

- I live in a fairly conservative area 

- I am attracted mainly to women but have some attraction to men. 

- As a male, I am attracted mainly to women but some attraction to men. When presenting androgynously [which I have yet to do], mainly to women.

- My interests are mixed in terms of gender and stereotypical associations: automobiles [stereotypically masculine, and my username is implying I'm a fan of certain Japanese brands], web design / computing [mixed gender]

- I am not overly macho but not effeminate, being in the middle-ground [if there is one]. I don't think watching Lifetime/Hallmark movies counts as that. I like shopping [but more about gadgets or discounts/haggling as [/r/personalfinanceuk](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinanceuk) mentions, rather than clothes shopping].

- I did only once experiment with crossdressing [way back in November 2004] but it was not for any sexual purposes, or fetish - it was purely for experimentation's sake. Back in November 2004 I had never even heard of the words genderfluid or androgyne. I liked it when I did it then, but it didn't come back to me until i read about androgyny around late 2016.

- I [obviously] have no issues with LGBT or non-binary or other gender identities.

- I worry about how this would affect my dating life/relationships even though I present as male 100% of the time [for now].

- I am attracted to women who dress and/or act very feminine.

- I had been attracted to a transwoman once [in mid-2005] but did not know she was trans, so it was obviously not a ""chaser""-related thing, and I treat transwomen as women.

- My area does not have much for meeting LGBT individuals [or even Wigan, the next big town up the road from it]. I want to be able to meet new people / LGBT individuals but there isn't the opportunity to do so.

- I live at home with my parents [but in this day and age, it is socially acceptable and the basement dweller stereotype is probably outdated]. I haven't mentioned this to them because it's not something I think they will understand and it's probably [for now] not something they need to know about.

- Work and research projects have left me little time to explore this area of my life.

I will admit, I was considering doing this but am uncertain of how to do this safely.

I couldn't back then in 2004, since I did not know much about genderqueer or non-binary identities.

I cannot really pass as feminine being a 5""9 owlish-looking individual with a masculine face.

I'm trans-masculine nonbinary and I'm doing a summer research fellowship that pays for housing at what is essentially a dorming house in NYC. The rooms the program pays for are single-occupancy dorms on halls with communal Male and Female bathrooms. The only option for gender neutral housing are studio apartments with in-suite bathrooms that would be about 850 dollars more expensive for the program.

Part of me feels like they should obviously pay the difference. I talked a ton in my application about being trans-masculine and nonbinary. You shouldn't accept a person to your program that your program is not capable of accommodating. You also shouldn't brand yourself as this progressive research fellowship if you're not equipped to handle trans students...It's also just so frustrating that I've had to make all the calls about this and deal with pretty upsetting and embarrassing phone calls with the dorming house, and no one from the program has reached out to help and there was no infrastructure in place to deal with this ahead of time, but again, maybe I'm expecting too much.

30 years ago, I asked for purple nail polish for my birthday and I was punished for that.

25 years ago, I don't want to talk about.

20 years ago, one day I painted my toes and was confused why it could make me so happy and so ashamed at the same time.

15 years ago, I ran with the goth crowd since it was acceptable to wear eyeliner and nail polish, I could dress however I wanted and I had some friends who had my back.

10 years ago, I had moved to a new place, and wore polish on my toes all the time because I liked it. Because I realized I could. I might even dare wear some manly gunmetal grey on my fingers when I was wearing a suit, because it matched my watch.

10 years ago, I was still completely unsure.

5 years ago, I saw another guy being bullied on a jobsite over and over, for being out. Being alt, for being effeminate, for being ""the gay"". For being different. And I got angry.

5 years ago, I got so angry that in fact, it forced me to start dealing with a lot of issues I had locked away.

5 years ago, I realized this is my body. I realized I'm 6'2"". I realized I'm 240lbs. I realized nothing is going to change that. 

5 years ago, I realized I'm a goddamed viking. I realized no one is gonna dare mess with me.

5 years ago, I cut out early for lunch and I came back with a manicure in bright neon pink.

5 years ago, there were stares, there were jokes.

5 years ago. I didn't say a word. I just stared them all down. Because I was a big imposing person and I could do that.

5 years ago, for one moment, I drew the ire away from someone who deserved a break from the hate. Someone who needed to know it was ok to be different. 

5 years ago, my crew chief called me in and asked me why, and I told them that ""it needed to be done for personnel reasons"". They knew damn well what was going on.

5 years ago, I got a silent look from 50 feet away that I know meant thank you.

5 years ago, I realized how brave he really was for being himself.

5 years ago, I stopped giving so much of my life to other people's opinions.

5 years ago, I carved out one little first step to firmly stand upon. And I am happier for it.

4 years ago, I realized that there were more options than just male or female.

3 years ago. I realized it's not the cloth or the paint or myself that is the problem.

2 years ago. I realized how scared I really am.

1 year ago. I realized I needed to talk to someone. 

A week ago I came out to a myself.

Yesterday I came out to a close friend. An actual human being.

And today. Today I will continue the life I almost ended 25 years ago because I couldn't begin understand how I felt.

I know that the hardest thing I will ever face is to be myself outside.

I will walk forward. I will come out to the world. I will be visible. I will be out.

For myself. For others who are looking for their own true self.

I am going have to take a hit every once in a while.  And I'm OK with that.

Thank you.
Sometime Sarah.

132,2017-05-26 13:48:57,6dh1z8,4,21,"Five years ago, when I made /r/DualGender and /r/bigender, I had to make a choice between the two. At the time, both terms were pretty interchangeable, and there weren't a lot of bigender people online that I could ask about which label they preferred. I went with the one that made the most sense to me at the time, and I figured using /r/DualGender would at least make it clear that the sub was about *gender*, and not something from Gulliver's Travels.

I knew launching one community would bring people together more easily than trying to launch two communities, and I worried that having two spaces would split people up, needlessly creating an arbitrary division where I was hoping to bring people together. I also didn't want to shake up a fledgling community by trying to move it to a new subreddit while it was still growing and getting established. So I closed one of the subs, leaving it empty, and added a redirect link to the one which had people and more activity, /r/DualGender.

However, as the years have passed, the term 'bigender' has grown in popularity and prominence. It's become the default term, and even I'm updating my label and my personal terminology to get with the times.

Meanwhile, /r/DualGender, always a quiet little sub, has sort of trundled along under the radar. Lately, I've been getting fresh messages in /r/bigender's modmail, asking for invites into the closed sub. I get a new one every couple of weeks; about a dozen since January.

So here are my questions: 

Should I open /r/bigender, or keep encouraging folks to head to /r/DualGender?  
If I open /r/bigender, will people use it?  
Should I leave both subs open, or should I try to redirect folks from /r/DualGender to /r/bigender?  
If I open /r/bigender, what sort of space would you like it to be?

I'm pretty certain I'm going to open /r/bigender, regardless, but this community is incredibly dear to me, and I want your feedback before I get started.

Friday night. It had been a really shitty day at the end of a really shitty two weeks of work. I was painting my toes, because reasons. (See previous posts) I was really feeling broken down, and she was watching me intently. And I just broke. Full open. Wreck.

Don't get me wrong, I've been dropping breadcrumbs for years about myself. (Yes, all those jokes about my inner child being a scared/angry 16 year old lesbian) Believe me it's been deliberate. I had been hoping she would dare to ask, because somehow that would have been so much easier.

But she supports me. We talked. Probably the most open conversation I have had in a year with her. She kinda sorta had realized.  I agreed I needed to go see a someone about this. I don't think it could have gone much better.

I thought after coming out I would feel so much better. I didn't sleep and had nightmares all that night.

I have never been scared of someone leaving. But believe me when she had to go walk the dogs. I was on the verge of crying.

Saturday we had a party to go to, where the one person I had previously come out to was. I got to talk to them. It was really helpful.

I had told the wife I had come out to someone, but I didn't feel comfortable telling her who. Because if they knew who, there could be conversations about me without me there, and I really don't want that right now, I'm 3 inches outside the closet door, and I'm still really scared.

Sunday was a whole day of MegaSuperHetero! (TM) manly things, like auto repairs since I gotta get to work. And I'm also good at those things. So I was really too beat up and tired to think about anything.

But today was a lot more laid-back clean house errands kind of day. The music was on, and I found myself dancing. I'm still worried. I'm still scared. My chest still hurts when I think about it too long. But from somewhere a little happiness creeped in, and I haven't felt that in years.

I'm not sure where I go from here. I have to find a therapist, to work on some gender issues, some ADHD, and a few other things, like smoking. But it's progress. 

I'm still here.

I'm somewhere between.
I'm cis.
I'm trans.
I'm pan.
I'm searching.

Anyway - onto the main question.

Do you sometimes feel that the area you live in is too conservative to express your identity and worry over bullying or genderqueerphobia?

My area is a fairly Acacia Avenue, sedan on the driveway type area, and although it's a good place to live in, it's a largely middle-aged or older demographic who reside there [some of whom vote Labour over Conservative]. Then again, where I live there is no real LGBT community as such.

I am not out to my parents yet about possibly being genderfluid [I live at home with them, and it's not just financial reasons] - but that's for another discussion.

Where are you from and how do you feel it is in general for expressing your identity and have you ever experienced really bad or horrifying genderqueerphobia? Do you ever feel that changing rooms are unaccommodating or have to resort to thrift stores [charity shops here in the United Kingdom] to look for clothing? [from what I've learnt online, thrift stores seem more accommodating in general]

Somewhere like San Francisco, Seattle or Toronto is mostly accommodating for LGBT people [using Wikivoyage as a source] but a more rural area may not be.

I would be interested to know your experiences on this and how you feel about things.

170,2017-05-31 11:40:06,6eedvi,6,21,"I came here a few months ago and made a big long rant about how I just couldn't figure out my gender. I was freaking out, wondering what was wrong with me. 

A lot of that is there still. I'm still questioning, still unsure, still scared. A couple people I think had asked essentially what the big deal was. And I realize I have this compulsive need to label myself, to put a name to what I'm feeling. Not because society insists on putting a label on everything, but because I need a name for the way I'm feeling. I need language to describe to myself and others who and what I am as a person so that I can process this. 

Lately I've realized that for a long time I've been dysphoric about my feminine voice. That only made said dysphoria worse. ^^Yay.
I've also started preferring a more ""male"" name and male pronouns. 

Does that mean I'm trans-masculine? Who knows. Who knows? I still love feminine clothing, dresses, purses, sparkles, pretty matte lipstick. I always pictured myself as a boy who likes feminine things. That's not....confusing. Right? I can be AFAB, identify as a boy, and still want to rock a gorgeous dress and sparkly nail polish. Right? 

I'm comfortable in almost every other aspect of my body, but that may change. My biggest worry is that I'll come out to everybody as NewName^TM and as he/him and then, I'll want to go by OldName^TM and she/her. Though at the moment she/her makes me recoil just a little bit. 

Also, how exactly does one come out to family? My friends see me as me, a being capable of change and fluidity. My family however, has only known me as OldName^TM and she/her for the past 24 years. They don't understand non-binary like my friends do.

Anyway. I'm sure no one cares much about this but I enjoy reading other people's updates and it really helps me feel less alone. So I thought I'd share mine.

Aka hair, and this relates to my step thingy. \n\nI shaved my chest clean, and it helps me feel better. But I was looking for tips. Is whacking it better, or laser or what? Also about other areas like legs and arms (also othersssssssss) I have no clue as to how so help please.\n\nThanks for any responses! Yay!  "", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Feeling Feminine.
