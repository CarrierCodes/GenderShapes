I've probably posted in this subreddit before but I can't remember. Long story short, I'm AFAB but have been questioning my feelings on gender since last year, so it's been a few months. At first I thought I was potentially a trans guy as I felt that I would identify as male but after some time that felt dishonest. I didn't have a strong sense of being male, only a desire to be one. I do still think of it every now and then.

I've tried to experiment with my gender expression, so I cut my hair, ordered a new binder and wear mostly ""masculine"" clothing. I've tried packing with a sock but also have a STP that I would like to purchase and try. Some of my friends call me my preferred name (which I really like), and when in safe spaces I tell people to use masculine or gender neutral pronouns.  To be honest I don't like  feminine ones, they do sometimes make me feel really uncomfortable and it reminds me people read me as female. Which I don't hate, I think women are great but I don't really know if I'm one?

But I also wonder my reasons behind a lot of things. Something that has happened recently is, I've been diagnosed with social anxiety, which has made me wonder if what I think is social dysphoria is actually just anxiety. 

I obviously take self identification seriously and don't want to identify as something for the wrong reasons or to get attention etc. I'd much rather not have gender related issues. 

I did read today about a concept about being cisgender by default, which made me curious. Can anyone explain this further, as maybe I'm not actually genderqueer/nonbinary but that?

7,2017-03-04 06:14:52,5xflm1,4,6,"(This is going to be pretty long but I will be eternally grateful to those who read it)

I'm 16, almost 17, and I've been questioning my gender on and off for about 3 years. For context, I'm AFAB. 

The first time it came up was when I was 14 and found out about androgynous fashion - I thought it was cool. I started dressing more androgynously, and started wondering if I was transgender. I thought about whether or not I wanted to be perceived as a guy, thought about transitioning (and wasn't sure whether I wanted to or not) but eventually it just left my mind. I didn't force the thoughts out or anything, I just stopped caring and was content with being seen as female again.

About a year and a half later, (and this is going to be a bit embarrassing) I was reading a yaoi fanfiction and thought, ""damn, I wish I could do that"" (in regard to penetrating someone) and then the thought crossed my mind, ""well shit, what does that mean?"" and thence started months of gender questioning and intense anxiety. 

Eventually it mostly went away again, and I was starting to feel more comfortable being seen as a woman, but then it came back again about a month ago.

Throughout this whole period, 'non-binary' has probably been what seems the most likely, but even then, I have doubts. Am I cis? Am I non-binary? Am I ftm? All these questions surround my mind and stress me out.

I'm pretty sure that I'm not FtM for a few reasons - whenever I get gendered as male in public, it makes me a bit uncomfortable. I've spoken to my doctor, my psychologist and my FtM friend about all of this, and from what I've told them, none of them feel that I am a FtM transgender person. Before all the questioning started, I was quite comfortable with my body and even wanted larger breasts. I was excited when I got to wear a proper bra for the first time because it made my chest appear larger. I would also try to achieve this through aloe vera gel massages. Additionally, I have always connected more with female characters in tv shows and video games, especially tomboyish ones (in recent years).

I'm not sure how I want to look physically and it stresses me out. I don't know what genitals I want. I want either small boobs or a flat chest (I'm not sure on this either). I'm attempting to lose weight so that I have a more androgynous figure. I'm really not sure about taking hormones because although some aspects appeal to me, like more muscle mass, I'm quite apprehensive about body and facial hair growth - I don't think it's something that I want.

A whole other can of worms is that I have had, and still have, issues with internalized misogyny. I've never had a decent female role model and all the happy/successful people around me have always been male. For reasons of jealousy, I kind of wish I had been born male - I'm aware that this might be a 'grass is greener' situation, but I feel like it would've saved me so much trouble growing up. Women have given me hell throughout my life, whether that be classmates or family. But although I get quite jealous of guys and kind of wish that I could've been born a guy, I don't think I want to be seen as one. So, a big question here is whether these feelings are caused by internalized misogyny, or gender, or both. It's also worth mentioning that sexual topics in my house were not talked about. My mum always made me feel very embarrassed of my body (unintentionally). I would go to my friends' houses where their mothers would openly talk to them about things like bras and periods and it was so foreign to me.

Another note: I am not a maternal person. I don't like kids, and the idea of becoming pregnant is repulsive to me. I feel like my first and secondary sexual characteristics are a constant reminder of my fertility, and I really don't like it.

This whole thing is incredibly stressful and I feel like I'm isolating myself because of it. I know that I'm overthinking it, but I just don't know what to do. I don't know what I want to look like. I don't know how I want to be seen.

Fortunately, I'm seeing a gender therapist for an assessment in three weeks, which I hope will be hopeful (by the way, are gender therapists typically aware of non-binary genders?).

Thanks for reading this wall of text and I would really appreciate your perspective/opinion on what you think is going on.

EDIT: Something that I thought I should mention. I actually miss dressing feminine. I used to love wearing makeup. I remember how pretty I would feel wearing dresses. I loved feeling pretty.

I noticed some neurogender ppl experience internalized ableism. I never really experienced internalized ableism wrt my gender, so I'm speaking for others here, but I think I understand where they come from. They treat their gender feels like they aren't real, like their gender feels are invalid because they're caused by their neurodivergence. This is like saying sensory overload is invalid because it's caused by autism, and ignoring what's actually causing the sensory overload. They also feel like identifying as trans would be appropriation.

If you identify with a neurogender, you shouldn't dismiss your gender feels. Your identity is just as valid as an NT's. Gender is something you feel, and what you feel is perfectly valid. You're allowed to change your life based on how you feel. You're allowed to identify as trans.

Curiously, as soon as the discussion of other genders begins, there is no longer a distinction between gender and gender identity. 

It would seem that when referring to the binary genders, gender (male/female) is equivalent to sex (male/female), and gender identity/expression (masculine/feminine) is distinctly different, relating to how people see themselves in relation to their gender/sex and how they choose to portray that idea.  

**In the case that gender is the same as gender identity then the two are distinctly different from sex. In this case though sex is male/female and gender or gender identity is masculine/feminine. 

Discussions of non-binary genders, genderfluid for example, seem to describe a gender identity. That is, one who feels more or less connected to their gender/sex (male/female) at different times. This is similar to how saying that a person is masculine is not identifying whether their gender or sex is male or female, it's simply describing some aspect of how you perceive them. I'm wondering in what way the term ""genderfluid"" and other non-binary terms are actually genders, and not merely an aspect of how one is perceived in relation to gender (i.e, gender identities).

The only way that this makes sense is if the term gender is equivalent to and synonymous with gender identity and the two are distinctly different from sex. If such is the case then I think this is a point of great confusion for many people. Saying that there are more than two genders is very difficult to understand without a clear definition of what gender is compared to biological sex and then also what gender identity is in relation to just gender.

In the case that gender is the same as gender identity and both are distinctly different from biological sex, then we must stop using the terms male and female as categories of gender, because they aren't. The word male is a noun that refers to a member of a particular species that possesses one X and one Y chromosome. This is completely unrelated to any form of identity at all. In fact the phrase ""I identify as male"" really makes no sense. What does it mean to identify with your DNA? In contrast, the phrase ""I identify as masculine"" does make sense because the word masculine is an adjective that corresponds to the typical traits of human males. By this logic, the slew of non-binary genders, are indeed forms of gender identity, distinctly different from biological sex, and the fact still stands that there are two sexes.

I 'came out' to a couple of social circles this week, who have all been supporting and understanding. This makes me happy. The details:

- I'm AFAB
- I asked to be called by my new (masculine) chosen name and he/him/his pronouns, but have also said I don't mind people using my birthname
- I've made no changes to my appearance: I still have a feminine haircut (although I've worn a cap on a couple of occasions which makes me look more masculine). I've always worn men's clothes anyway

Thing is, I keep getting insecurities about it all. That I've gone about it the wrong way.

- Have I gone too quickly, by not being out privately for months and really thinking through the concequences? (I admit it, I was too excited and only seriously thought about my gender for about a week. Once I realised ""what I am"" I got impatient. But at the same time, I've known something has been up for a long time)
- Am I going too slowly, by not cutting my hair, and allowing people to use my birthname?
- I haven't considered my family, or the man I'm having the odd date with and regularly texting. What will they think?
- Am I asking too much to ask people to call someone with a feminine haircut by a man's name?
- Am I stupid? Childish? Is this a phase? Is the happiness I get from looking like a man just excitement of looking different?

First off, I'd like to apologize because this is a throwaway account, because I do not want people who know my main account to know all this. Now that that's out of the way, time to explain who I am.

Sometimes while intimate with my partner I feel as though I'd be happier as a male (I'm afab). I don't know if this is just due to dysphoria or what but it makes me so insecure about my confidence in my identity. It's not just sex tho, random aspects of my life will make me question myself. Such as the fact I love make up and finding new ways to change my look, making myself more masc looking or crafting a specific style. I still enjoy the fem looks I can do, but I can only do them some days otherwise I feel extremely dysphoric and uncomfortable around any and everyone. Sometimes things like this make me feel like on those days I've just managed to convince myself I'm gender queer and that I'm not even really trans at all.

I went gown shopping tried on some gowns and only felt the normal amount of discomfort that comes when trying on clothing. Today, however, I decided to try the gown on again and felt a wave of anger and frustration and sadness. It's never happened before and the timing couldn't have been worse. It may be because I've finally felt the surge of confidence that comes with wearing a suit, but whatever the case is, I just want to be able to get over it as I know it's too late to change what I'm wearing and wearing a suit will only ensure punishment from my mother.  I'm open to any and all ideas; I just want all these negative emotions to go away...

(i realize the two can be linked, but it's an important distinction for me)

i love the idea of being ambiguous. i used to work in telemarketing and on the rare occasions that somebody would refer to me as ""sir"" (i have a semi-low voice for a ladyperson) i'd be absolutely ecstatic. i want to be nothing, as weird and negative as that sounds. this is a lot harder to pull off in person though, as i have a fairly feminine face and a large chest.

i sort of want to bind, but that feels like going too far on what's basically a whim, when i know there are people who are actually Uncomfortable with the gender perceptions society has forced on them. i sort of want to use they/them pronouns, but again i don't feel it's worth troubling my friends to learn to refer to me as something else, or explaining to my family.

i also have depression, and have been casually suicidal for years (not in that i've made plans to kill myself, but often think about death and would prefer to be dead at any given time), and i'm worried my desire to be seen as neither female nor male is more about erasing myself as an entity than it is about discovering or exploring who i am. i cannot tell.

i want to clarify, i don't see other nb folks as nothing. several people very close to me are nb, including my partner, who i've recently asked to refer to me as they/them, and they're now encouraging me to tell other people. when they do remember to use they/them, it's a feeling of excitement, not necessarily rightness - i'm just really happy to not be ""she""

TL;DW She says she can't give a concrete answer to what gender is or what being female means to her because there doesn't seem to be any absolutes when you look closely.

Are these two women binary? I'm really curious to know, if you identify as non-binary, do you believe that everyone is? or is there something/a few things that you feel separate you from people who more comfortably fit into the typical gender categories? EDIT: or is it just a sense of not being close enough to male or female to comfortably assume those titles?

TL;DR It just seems like even for people who transition to the other gender (binary transgender) the idea of gender for them is still quite amorphous. These descriptions of gender sound very similar to agender/non-binary. So what's the difference?

Discovering the concept of non-binary identities years ago was a huge awakening for me, and I'm glad I've acknowledged my identity and my dysphoria. And identifying as non-binary has been freeing because it's allowed my to acknowledge my desire for certain aspects of transition, like top surgery, without feeling pressured to have a firm binary identity or transition ""fully.""

But I have a really hard time figuring out how and where I ""fit"" in the larger LGBTQ community, and feeling like, in general, there's no solution for my dysphoria. I like the idea of passing as male and sometimes I have strong dysphoria where I wish I had a cis male body. But ultimately, I don't feel like that dysphoria is strong or consistent enough that starting hormones and ""completely"" transitioning to male is definitely the right thing for me. Maybe it is, and I'm moving in that direction, but there are enough things that I'm not dysphoric about or that I like about my body that I just don't know if I'm ready. 

But I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I miss feeling like a part of the lesbian/bisexual woman community sometimes, because I identified strongly with it before I realized I was non-binary, but I don't identify as female and don't feel comfortable implying that I do. I'm bisexual, but I feel like men will never find me attractive as anything but a woman, and dating men makes me feel more dysphoric because I feel like even if they're bisexual/pansexual, I won't be attractive to them in the way I want to be attractive. But I also don't feel like I fit into a lot of masculine communities, and I worry that if I do transition to a point where I pass as male, I'll feel out of place. Even among trans men, I feel out of place sometimes because I don't pass. 

If I'm honest with myself, I probably have some internalized transphobia that's making me be harder on myself about not passing. But to some degree this is also just my dysphoria being weird and vague.

Maybe I'm too focused on the idea of labels or being a member of a specific community, but that's always how I've felt. I like feeling a sense of belonging and community. I hate feeling like I don't belong anywhere, and because of that, when my dysphoria fluctuates, I'm prone to trying to convince myself that I can identify as a cis woman or a binary trans man even though I know that eventually, the pendulum will swing again.

First of all, I want to make clear that this is only my personal opinion, and the way I personally dealt with my own internal struggles. You may think like me, or you may not. Either way, let's respect each other, and if need be, extensively discuss this, alright?

I will say it bluntly: At the end of the day, gender serves no purpose, and should be disregarded. EXCEPT if it helps you cope with your problems, that is.
And even if so, WHAT IS gender exactly? We can argue, read, point out more material to read and educate ourselves. But in the end, it's just a bunch of roles, assigned to one gender or the other. And this disregards the non-binary community as a whole.

So, gender is just the set of socially imposed rules passed on generation to generation. Men have to work and earn money, while women have to raise children, prepare food and clean the house.

Obviously, those roles are being redefined and defied, because they are, well, outdated. So...is gender outdated as well?


All of this comes from me deciding wether or not I'm trans or not. See, I'm a 26 male, whom never had any kind of dysphoria, but always felt inclined towards a more classical 'female' set of roles. I like cooking, I'm great with kids, and so on.
Should my entire gender identity change on a whim just because society keeps telling me that the things I like are ""for girls"" ?
Of course not.

So, I believe, in an ideal world, if we abolish gender roles, we kind of abolish gender as a whole, too. Which is great, since anyone who wants to identify with a gender would be able to, without much fuss. And anyone wishing NOT to identify with any gender would be able to do that as well.

I'll analyze all the stories and compare them to my own, and often I'll find a lot in common. Or maybe convince myself that I've found a lot in common. But right when I start to take steps to make some real changes, I'll regress and suppress the event for months or even years like it never happened. I don't know if this is because I didn't have a strong support system and got scared by the kickback from my family compiled with other issues, or, if I am literally just fucking with myself because there is something  wrong with me.
The first time I did this, I was around eighteen or so. A guy had come out in my very queer friend group, and there were some other people coming out about being trans. All of that really made me question myself, like a whole lot; and at the time, it added up that I was trans too. So I came out as nonbinary, and later ftm. At the time, I didn't receive the same support or acceptance as these other people did; long story short, they didn't really take me seriously. I wasn't, at the time, a stereotypical masculine person. I had a lot of anxiety and depression. That and other teenage, college drama added up and I eventually left the friend group, and started to dress more androgynous and trying to present female. I still lived with my parents, and masculine presentation upset them. That and people were fucking terrible because it was the goddamn sticks.

Flash forward a few years, I pretty much did the same thing again. Came out as trans at a school, started living as a guy, and then my parents flipped out and I realized I needed to be able to support myself without parents doing random pirouettes off fucking handles. So I enlisted in the military like a fucking genius, and here we are a few years later thinking about the same bullshit again. 
I'm sorry if this is kind of convoluted, I'll wrap it up. Right now I'm presenting as a female at work, not like I have much of a choice. Most of the time, I don't feel like I'm even human; pretty disassociated, angry and depressed 90% of the time. But I don't know if that's due to the environment, which basically fucks up everyone equally, or, if it's because of the environment and repressed trans crap. I'll go months or years without thinking about this stuff, just riding my little bicycle along, and then it's like I try to put a stick between the spokes and knock my ass over. So I guess I'm wondering if any of you have ever met a cisgender person who was just such a mess about stuff that they convinced themselves they were trans? I know that sounds silly, but I'm really just tired of dealing with this crap on my own.

So I'm 26, been on hrt nearly 2 years now(mtf) and really getting towards the end of my rope.
I went through a period of severe depression with a lot of alcoholism before I started with transitioning. For the most part the depression has never gone away but it has definitely changed. Drinking not an issue now.
I was initially studying electrical engineering right out of high school but after a few years of failing and repeating over and over again I stopped. It was around this point I accepted that I was trans and began working towards hrt. 
Last year I had my name officially changed and went full time. (Great! ) 
I began studying to become a nurse at the start of last year. Its great and I really enjoy it but I had a slight bump with depression and ended up failing a bunch of classes 2nd semester. Since then the depression has gotten worse again and I have been suicidal on and off for months. 
I've been on effexor for over 2 years. 
I have been unable to bring myself to even apply for any jobs(i live off centrelink( government support)) for more then a year. I am repeating some classes this semester but its already looking like I'm failing again. 
I cant see how I will ever be able to afford to get srs and that really gets to me as I get serious dysphoria about it. Anxiety can be a huge problem when im out as well.

So I have no motivation or drive to do anything past the bare minimum needed to live, I've started on the downward spiral that is failing at uni again, I cant manage to loose weight and srs is probably years away. 
I have been cutting myself starting from a few weeks ago ( its helps at the time), been very suicidal at times but haven't quite been able to get to it (yet...)

Yes I have tried talking to friends about this, while they might want to help me they understandably feel way out of their depth. I am going to talk to another counselor today at uni. 
I haven't been able to tell my gp about any of the suicidal thoughts or cutting (same with my regular therapist)

I shrugged it off as a rather hollow invitation at the time (i'm not sure why) but still said yes, a long with lots of other people.

Last night it became a reality, and just like he'd told me stories of previous year's get togethers, lots of people backed out when push came to shove. From my perspective it was just going to be him, a mutual friend i met through him (guy #2), and myself going. Both of them know i'm trans, and both of them are super accepting and supportive, so I absolutely went for it.

Shortly after I found out that another guy, someone I don't know and have never spoken too before is going also (guy #3), that's fine, no biggie i'm sure he's great.

Guy #3 is talking to guy #2 (in dms) and asking questions about me, he asks what my name is, now guy #2 is so freaking precious  he panics and asks guy #1 (who i'm closer with) to ask me instead, because and I quote:

&gt;i feel weird asking cause it feels like im dropping an ultimatum like im in any place to be doing that

I had been planning to hopefully go as myself the whole time I was there with them, and this extra guy shouldn't impact that plan really, so I just said to tell him my real name (not deadname) and if worst comes to worst it's a gender neutral name anyway, even though the last thing I want associated with me and that name is boymode, but, hey, whatever.

So after all the details are settled and bookings are made and stuff I go to bed with a big smile on my face, I don't really sleep that much and spend the whole night in my head planning outfits. (Lol)

Come morning my cat wakes me up for some breakfast, normally she wakes my mum up, but i guess i was restless enough to get all the attention this morning. After i'm properly awake and about to get up she climbs onto my bed and curls up next to me (something she literally never does, she's developed an aversion to cuddles for some reason) now i'm quietly squeeing into my pillow that the cat is curled up next to me.

When she finally get's sick of lying next to me (after a good 5 minutes, go kitty!) we get out of bed and I pull on some dirty shorts from h&amp;m that i wore yesterday. Normally I wear my shorts around my hips in boymode and not around my waist, but this morning i just pulled them up to my waist without even thinking.

As I turn around to head out the door I stop dead and stare at the mirror, my room was still heaps dark so I was mostly just a silhouette in the mirror but since when have i had a narrow waist?! my shoulders are still way wider than my hips are, but with this new found narrow waist my body almost has some shape.

In the low light i couldn't make out any of my stupid body hair, and my bed-head was hanging loosely down in front of my shoulders, holy shit i actually liked what i saw in the mirror for the first time in... ever?

I head into the bathroom (more light) and put my hair up in a high ponytail, again, something i never normally do, and go feed the cat / make coffee.

I'm sitting here cross legged on the couch with my cat next to me, a big shit eating grin on my face, and tears in my eyes. Actually, genuinely happy. Best day of my life?

After i'm properly awake and about to get up she climbs onto my bed and curls up next to me (something she literally never does, she's developed an aversion to cuddles for some reason) now i'm quietly squeeing into my pillow that the cat is curled up next to me.\n\nWhen she finally get's sick of lying next to me (after a good 5 minutes, go kitty!) we get out of bed and I pull on some dirty shorts from h&amp;m that i wore yesterday. Normally I wear my shorts around my hips in boymode and not around my waist, but this morning i just pulled them up to my waist without even thinking.\n\nAs I turn around to head out the door I stop dead and stare at the mirror, my room was still heaps dark so I was mostly just a silhouette in the mirror but since when have i had a narrow waist?! my shoulders are still way wider than my hips are, but with this new found narrow waist my body almost has some shape.\n\nIn the low light i couldn't make out any of my stupid body hair, and my bed-head was hanging loosely down in front of my shoulders, holy shit i actually liked what i saw in the mirror for the first time in... ever?\n\nI head into the bathroom (more light) and put my hair up in a high ponytail, again, something i never normally do, and go feed the cat / make coffee.\n\nI'm sitting here cross legged on the couch with my cat next to me, a big shit eating grin on my face, and tears in my eyes. Actually, genuinely happy.

Second, I'm truly sorry if I accidentally say something offensive.  I'm a cis man and don't have a lot of experience with the trans community, other than a superficial understanding and support.  So, here's the situation.

I received a Facebook friend request a couple weeks ago from someone I didn't recognize, but we had some mutual friends so I decided to approve.  I noticed (and here's something that might be offensive) that they were a trans woman, but didn't really think anything of it.

A few days later, I saw the popular post that was going around about the scientist who used evidence to refute someone saying that gender was a simple black and white issue and I shared it.  The new friend liked it and wrote something to the effect of, ""[Mutual friend] also shared this, I love you both!""

To be honest, I was dumbfounded.  The last time I saw them was when I went to their wedding a couple of years ago, but since they moved out of state I didn't really keep in touch (because I'm terrible at that).

I guess my question is, what do I say?  I want to reach out to her, because she's undergone a huge life change.  I have a lot of questions for her, about her transition, about her marriage, about her family, but I don't want to bombard her.  I think the questions are coming from a sincere place, but I don't want to draw attention to her trans identity.  I want to say something about not realizing who she was when I first accepted the request, but I don't want to draw attention to the fact that I could recognize her as trans.  Like I said before, that seems like it would be offensive to say.

Right now, I consider myself gender fluid.
I recently cut my hair and I love it. I definitely feel more connected to my guy side. 

 Lately I've been watching a few ftm YouTube channels, and have been thinking about what it would be like to be on hormones. 

For a little background, in 2008 I went to a school that had therapy combined. And for a while while I was there, I would dress in guys clothes, and I even had my friends there call me by a different name. 

I tried telling my mom how I felt, and she told me that it was just a phase. That people who are trans show signs of it when they're little, and I never did. 

So I hid how I felt, until I moved out. And within the last could years I came out as gender fluid, after coming out as pansexual. 
 
Lately I've been feeling way more guyish then usual. And like I said I've been thinking on what it would be like to be on T. Could I be trans?

For myself, I had breast tissue forming within 3 weeks. I had A cup breasts between months 2 and 3. I've had B cup breasts since the start of my 5th month, and I will be on hormones for 6 full months on April 12th.

My thighs had filled out a lot during the first 2 months, my ass started filling out at the start of my 2nd month, and my hips became obvious at the beginning of my 5th month.

My face started softening right away, and around month 3 or 4 is when there was a major difference.

My shoulders started softening within the first 2 months, but there wasn't a major change until months 3 or 4.

Throughout this whole experience my nipples have itched  (since week 2), and I've felt aches in my calves, arms, and shoulders from the change on my muscle mass.

As a side note, I have hazel eyes (light brown/green). Since starting hormones, the green in my eyes started slowly pulling to the forefront, so that now it's a toss up on whether they are ""more golden brown"" or more green, or somewhere oddly inbetween.

Edit: I want to point out that, even though my voice has changed dramatically, it's not as a result of hormones. Estrogen will not reverse the effects of testosterone on the vocal chords. But over the past 7 or 8 months I've been undergoing intense vocal training, not professional. 

Because I work in retail, in Texas, it's extremely important for me to pass vocally, and it's always been a big source of my dysphoria.

In response, I started a thread which asked people not to use body-part words to conflate womanhood, as that is exclusionary to some trans women (bear in mind I don't know the make-up of the group as far as if any trans-women/gnc/non-binary peeps are present, though I did wait a few hours to see if anybody else would raise this issue and nobody did). 

The post asked respectfully if people could take some time to think through why we would use body-part names as stand-ins/shorthand for 'women' and to reflect on how that might be exclusionary to some people who do not have those body parts but who nevertheless ARE women. 

The thread was pretty badly derailed into loads of people being annoyed that they apparently are no longer allowed to celebrate or talk about their body parts or experiences related to those body parts. Though I reiterated a bunch of times that that was not my point, people persisted in mis-reading my post and making it all about how they were apparently being silenced. There was a lot of 'us vs them' going on as well, which was sad. 

Ok, so that's the background. 

For me, I want to be a good ally. I believe strongly that its not up to trans (or other oppressed groups) to always instigate discussions to drive progressive change, and that its up to me to use my privilege to help create safer spaces, whether or not people from that oppressed group are present (yet) or not. (Maybe they're not present because the space hasn't been made safe enough for them - ?) 

However, I do NOT want to fall into the trap of being a cis-white knight and creating drama and messiness which could end up making spaces less safe for trans people. I also do not want to speak for trans people or over them, but l also do not want to force people to out themselves in order to speak with authority and be heard (not that that always works anyway). 

Please tell me how I can navigate this space to push towards a better result, without silencing or talking over trans voices, but without requiring outing, or tokenising trans people. I'm really stuck and I need to know if I am on the right track or if I'm way off base here. 

I struggle with ally-ship in this way across a range of issues and maybe there isn't a clear or ready or easy answer, but I am not prepared to move forward without input and guidance from groups to which I consider myself an ally being able to feedback into my actions.

It's like, I'm reasonably sure that I'm genderfluid (in addition to bisexual), because I can't help but imagine what I'd be like as a woman.

But it's like, I know that's not possible.

I don't have the right body to just transition to being a woman, or even be able to be one for a little bit. My body isn't the right form. I've got a guy shape. Not a small guy shape either, but a large guy shape. I'd feel like a pig in a dress. I see pictures of thin folk transitioning and they just look right. I feel like I'd just look ... foolish.

Which is funny, because I ROCK the kilt (which is as close as I get these days to dressing in a feminine way).

I want to be feminine, but I *love* my beard. I like my shoulders. I like myself no matter my size (which is a big deal for me, since I had body issues about my potentially being overweight for years until I actually *was* overweight, and then I was fine with things). I want to nail those high notes and just have my range be up there and sing Toxic and not have it be a crowd pleaser just because I'm just a big fellow rocking on it, but at the same time, I love my pitch and such. I want to be feminine, it thoughts as well as looks, but I still rather like who I am. I want smaller, more curvy shape than what I have, more svelte, that sort of thing, but I like my bulk too.

1,2017-03-01 06:32:04,5wts79,2,4,"Hi all, 

Longtime lurker here to finally make a post. Let me tell you a bit about myself first to put things into context. I'm 22 and afab. I have hated many things about being female since puberty and hating my body resulted in a lot of dark thoughts/low self esteem/etc. during high school. I didn't realize until I was around 18 or 19 that other people shared my feelings in regard to their breasts and that many people received top surgery. I also didn't know much about what being transgender was growing up (as I am sure many of you can agree that it was not nearly as talked about as it is now). Once I learned about the term genderqueer, the pieces started to fit into place. I've thought of myself as such for about four years now.
Fast forward to the present and my question: I am tired of feeling closeted. I already know that I like how I look when presenting in a more traditionally ""masculine"" fashion. And I want to come out as such. I want to ask people to see me as a boy sometimes (address me as he/him if they desire). I want to, at the very least, resolve some of my own conflict about my gender (or lack thereof, etc.) and I am the only person stopping myself from getting help with this. But I hear that some therapists disagree with the idea of genderqueer identities. I don't want to walk in and find myself labelled as another ""transtrender"". I actually worry a lot about being seen as someone who is ""making it all up"" to people who don't understand, but I really just want to live a life free of a label that doesn't accurately define me and that makes me miserable (female). If anyone has had a positive experience, I would be so grateful for anything you're willing to share!

One last thing- I would like to try to find a therapist who will talk with me about my options for top surgery (approval needed for health insurance). I hear this is more difficult for genderqueer folks so if you have specific knowledge of this situation please let me know! I do not want to go on T so this may further harm my chances of getting the surgery.

I've been through a lot of stuff recently (abuser dying, no longer living in fear of hacking/exposing/online shaming, finally acknowledging my own history of rape/abuse, and realizing my negative feelings towards men may be more than just hatred of patriarchy.)

I am still trying to unravel it all, because I think I see a lot of gender backwards. My perception of masculinity is more centered around overcompensated shows of strength, arrogance, socially reinforced weakness/superficial intelligence, and rigid conformity to a norm, whereas my perception of femininity is real strength, perseverance, high levels of intelligence, empathy, compassion, and solidarity. I mean, I know it's my perception. And there are awesome men. But it's how I feel when I'm identified as male?

Anyhoo... I wrote some notes and would welcome feedback on what my next steps could be in my gender exploration! 

What I Want:
I don't want people to respect my masculinity.
I don't really want to care about what other people think. Perhaps more importantly, I want people to SEE that I don't care what they think.
I want to feel free.
I want to feel and dress creatively.
I want to be colorful.
I want to be comfortable.
I want to feel sexy.
I want to show off parts of my body that make me feel sexy. My calves, thighs, butt, breasts, upper back, feet.
I don't really want to explain myself. Unless I do!
I want help exploring.
I don't want to be ashamed.
I want to feel powerful.
I don't want to be grouped with men.
I don't want to feel alone.
I want to feel strong but soft.
I want to feel pretty but not dainty.
I don't really want to feel obligated to dress a certain way, male or female.
Sometimes I want to hide.
I want to take advantage of my feminine features (lips, eyebrows, calves, thighs).
I want to feel like I'm part of a community.

What I Don't Know:
If I ever want to be gendered as a woman.
If I ever want to wear dresses.
If I ever want to take estrogen.
I don't know if I ever want to wear a bra.
How I would want my kids to address me.
If I would want to have sex with straight men.
How I want my dynamic with my wife to change, if at all.
I don't know if I want to wear heels.

I identified as agender for years and years before accepting I'm trans. I finally came out to myself three and a half years ago. I came out and went by a femme name, but it didn't feel right, so I chose a neutral one that could be short for either a common female or male one. But I got on hormones as soon as I could afford it, lasered my face, changed my legal name (to the female version of what I go by). I basically refuse to wear makeup, though, because effing yuck. I rarely get gendered female by strangers, but when I do, or when someone seems unsure, I'm happy.

I tell people: they *and* she for pronouns; neutral name *and* femme name. (Actually, I went by neutral name *only* for well over a year before telling anyone the femme version was also my name.)

I've never called myself a trans woman. I say I'm a trans feminine person.

But lately... I've noticed some things.

I got a letter from someone addressed to ""Ms. Femme Name.""  It felt *so. good.* And I thought, this is so much nicer than ""Mx. Neutral Name.""

One day I was out, dressed super andro, got ""Miss"" from a stranger, and I was like, *heart skips a beat.*

There's been some bedroomy stuff, but I won't get into the deets.

Here was the kicker. An older friend of mine recently referred to me, in a very offhand way, as ""basically my daughter.""

I've been out to my folks over three years. My dad, who I love very much, was kinda hard on me growing up and even in my adulthood. He hasn't really said much about me being trans, but he showed he accepted me by being less hard on me, and he's the fist person in my life to call me ""Femme Name"" regularly. But he doesn't call me daughter.

My mom is weird about it. Not hurtful exactly, just clearly uncomfortable. She doesn't call me daughter either. 

So when my friend said that... it's literally the first time I heard someone refer to me as a ""daughter.""

I don't want to be called a child. I like being called daughter. I don't want to be a sibling. My brother calls me sister, and I like it. I've felt weird about it because I was unsure for a long time, but I like it. 

I think I'm just a trans woman who happens to prefer andro styles and hates the fuck out of makeup. Seriously, fuck that shit. (But just watch. Maybe soon I'll be drowning in eyeliner and lippy things.)

But I want to say: thank you to the folks of this sub. /r/MtF is so saturated with ultra femme messaging. Wonderful people, but as a group it just feels so focused on following the script. So focused on ""transition."" I've never once on /r/genderqueer read a thread where  someone gets ganged up on for their eyebrows. I long for a world where that tired old trope weren't so very real.

What I've learned from this sub is that what I've been doing isn't transition: it's transcendence. So here's me, putting aside my own preconceived notions of gender. Here's me, overcoming my fears. Maybe once I've lived with it awhile, the label won't matter so much to me. But for now, I'm claiming it.

I'm andro and maybe a little masculine sometimes. I like spitting and swearing and scotch (neat, please). I like plaid, will not get my ears pierced or wear any more jewelry than a necklace, and wearing a dress will never ever keep me out of the woods or the mud. I like my nails trimmed short (but oh gosh yes with polish) and my footwear practical.

I'm new to this subreddit, to reddit in general, and to accepting my identity as somewhere outside of cis and binary trans. I'm learning a lot from some folks with gender identities that are very different from what I'm used to. But I wouldn't be here if I didn't have one of those more poorly understood identities.

Right now the two words I'm using to reflect my gender identity are non-binary and genderqueer. There may also be a certain degree of fluidity in my gender.

Luckily I have a really supportive network of people that I've started coming out to. I'm most nervous to come out to my parents. I have come out to them before as bisexual (a term I no longer use due to the prefix) and while it was weird and awkward, ultimately it was okay. And the 2 family members I confided in say that this will be no different. But it is scary.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for in writing this post. I guess if anyone has tips and tricks for someone who is just figuring all of this out, that would be helpful.

30,2017-03-05 15:42:46,5xnchc,9,15,"For background, I am 36, AMAB, nonbinary, primarily attracted to women, and single.  I am not on any kind of hormones and do not intend to be, so my body is unambiguously male and will stay that way, but I also don't have a very ""manly"" body type.  I'm healthy but have a small frame and not a lot of muscle, I look very young, and I have soft skin.  Over the past couple years I became really comfortable with the outward aspects of gender, dressing the way I want, and I love the way I look now, and feel comfortable expressing myself the way I want most of the time.  I have about shoulder-length hair, sometimes wear dresses or skirts, often wear all ""men's"" clothes, often mix it up, especially with casual clothing from the women's section.  I'd describe how I dress as casual and fun, and I'm trying to look ""soft"" and ""cute"" rather than ""edgy"" or ""sexy"".

Social things outside of dating feel pretty comfy to me.  Even before I was ""out"" about being nonbinary, and dressed in all men's clothing, I had been pretty comfortable navigating mostly-female settings, which has been important to me because I've always related better to women and wanted to be ""one of the girls"".  When it comes to friendship and being included in social activities, I feel like I interact with women pretty naturally, and have for a long time.

And when I've been in serious relationships, or already involved with people romantically or sexually, I also have been pretty comfortable with the gender dynamic.  I haven't had any big gender-related problems here...these people have usually been really understanding and supportive.

But I still have a huge problem:

Navigating those early stages of dating and relationships though, has remained one of the most challenging, frustrating, and sometimes toxic aspects of my life.  It's the one aspect of my life where I feel like, for all purposes, I am treated and perceived fully ""as a guy"" by most people -- including ways that feel very bad and wrong.  Some of the examples:

* I feel like 95%+ of the expectation for initiating things is placed on me.  I am very rarely asked out or have people initiate any sort of dating or relationship with me.
* I feel a strong asymmetry in most of the social relationships I have with women that I feel attracted to, in which I am trying to test out the waters of whether or not I could become closer to them, or communicate that I like them and am open to becoming closer to them.  I experience a lot of dropped conversations, and people frequently cancel dates with me last-minute.  A lot of these women fall out of my life unless I continually put in effort to reach out to them.
* Some of the things women have said and done to me, suggest that I am still sometimes being perceived as ""threatening"" the way a lot of men are.  There have been a couple of women I've met in person through social events, who conspicuously avoid me.  I find this super frustrating and confusing because none of these women have explained to me anything I did that crossed a boundary, and I am and always have been 100% committed to respecting any personal boundaries people assert, so it's a ""black box"" for me and it's also like, untrue, like if people are perceiving me as threatening, I'm not, like, if someone ever tells me to leave them alone or stop giving them a certain type of attention, I'll respect that unconditionally and I will not react negatively to them doing that.

It's really puzzling to me because these things seem glaringly in conflict with what I experience in the rest of my life, which is that women tell me repeatedly that they feel really comfortable and safe around me, that I am a very nonthreatening person, that they feel comfortable talking with me about things that they only feel comfortable talking with women about, that I'm ""basically one of the girls"" or ""an honorary girl"" or things like that.

The internet is full of ""dating advice"" but it's almost all oriented toward men and women.  A lot of the advice directed at men is directing me to portray myself as a person I am not (I feel like I'm a pretty confident person on a deep level, but I often like to display confidence through emotional vulnerability) but the advice directed at women who date women is also of limited use to me (some of it is useful) because it doesn't provide anything about how to navigate or respond to being viewed or treated ""like a man"".  I don't want to ""be the man"" in the relationship.  I want to date someone who is comfortable dating a male-bodied person and chucking the gender roles and norms out the window and explicitly renegotiating those roles based on our personalities and values.

It also feels most natural to me to date through my existing friend group.  I would rather date someone I know, with whom I have mutual friends, because I don't feel fully comfortable with someone until I see them interact with other people.  I also tend to feel like attraction dovetails with friendship with me.  I tend to feel attracted to my friends and I tend to want to have a closer friendship with people I feel more attracted to.

The problem is there is something coming out in these dynamics that is somehow becoming jarring or bad.  I'm not able to pinpoint it...maybe something that I'm doing that is tapping into bad patterns of behavior associated with maleness?  I don't know.

It's puzzling too though because another thing numerous women have told me is that they have trouble reading when I'm attracted to women (and many people who don't know me at all even question whether I'm attracted to women at all) because they say my behavior comes across as very friendly and I don't do many things that seem to unambiguously express attraction.

I'm really struggling to express my sexuality and my attraction to and interest in people, in ways that they feel comfortable with and that lead to the results that I want.  I am wanting to examine my behavior and figure out how I can change it to lead to the results I want.  I also am struggling with feeling intense shame associated with my sexuality and feelings of attraction.  Like, for me, my sexuality is a source of love and warmth and gratitude and positive energy towards the people I feel attracted to.  And I find it really frustrating and invalidating when all those positive things are interpreted negatively by others.

I tend to feel attracted to my friends and I tend to want to have a closer friendship with people I feel more attracted to.\n\nThe problem is there is something coming out in these dynamics that is somehow becoming jarring or bad.  I\'m not able to pinpoint it...maybe something that I\'m doing that is tapping into bad patterns of behavior associated with maleness?  I don\'t know.\n\nIt\'s puzzling too though because another thing numerous women have told me is that they have trouble reading when I\'m attracted to women (and many people who don\'t know me at all even question whether I\'m attracted to women at all) because they say my behavior comes across as very friendly and I don\'t do many things that seem to unambiguously express attraction.\n\nI\'m really struggling to express my sexuality and my attraction to and interest in people, in ways that they feel comfortable with and that lead to the results that I want.  I am wanting to examine my behavior and figure out how I can change it to lead to the results I want.  I also am struggling with feeling intense shame associated with my sexuality and feelings of attraction.  Like, for me, my sexuality is a source of love and warmth and gratitude and positive energy towards the people I feel attracted to.  And I find it really frustrating and invalidating when all those positive things are interpreted negatively by others.\n\nI don\'t know, is any of this making any sense?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Gender Works Great For Me Now, Except The Early Stages of Dating Are Awful - How To Navigate This?', 'created': 1488753766.0}"

idk what to do. i do fear for safety if i was non passing in such an aggressive bro-y environment but its also unexpectedly dysphoria inducing to be read as and expected to be a cis male.  
Even people who know I'm afab and use she/her still talk to me like I'm cis... hell i got texted memey nsfw at work by a coworker bc it wasnt being sent over the company email .... sooooo uh. weird ideas of acceptance from cis men idk my work culture is very crude.

So I've been figuring out this concept of gender queerness for some time now and I still have a long way to go, but almost right away I found the idea that Androgyne (as I understood it to be gender neutral) was so masculine.

But I have come to learn from my therapist that some people take the ""Andro"" (greek for male) seriously and place Androgyny on the masculine side of the non binary spectrum.

I like Femme stuff, not because it's femme but because I enjoy looking beautiful. Though it could be my creative side, which is divine Femme as I understand it.

So Andro being male, Gyno being the Greek for female, I did a quick search for Gynogyne and it came up with what looks like german papers on the subject?

I am not sure if I like Gynogyne to describe myself, but I definitely don't dislike it. But I really am to Femme to call myself Androgyne if it really is masculine neutral.

Anyways! As I said, I'm not yet out to everyone (mostly only to a temporary counselor I have, and a few close friends.) and here's a few things I'm dreading as I come to terms  with things....  Here goes:

- I am not... sure about labels. I am AFAB nonbinary, this much I know. In highschool, I thought I was a transboy, but once my therapist told my parents, I panicked, and told them I didn't mean it. And to some extent, I didn't. I like the term 'transmasculine'. I've heard a lot of NB/Genderqueer folk say that looking for a label won't work for you. How did yall find the one right for you?

- I am planning on coming out to my parents on my 20th birthday (April) when they come to visit. I'm AFAB nonbinary, and though I know that they're understanding/loving/will support me always, it's scary. I also don't know if they're educated on genderqueerness... Is there really any good way to go about this??

- I've looked into gender-focused therapy, but it's a little overwhelming. I'm not sure if there's anything in particular I should be looking for, as I've heard some horror stories as well as wonderful stories from others here. I guess I'd just like to know what to look for and what to avoid??

- Finally... Self-acceptance. Any advice on any sort of practice/mindset that you have used in coming to terms with yourself and your identity would be greatly appreciated.

Second, next steps. For a while i've wanted to figure out what it would take to start hormones, or facial hair removal, or what other steps are out there i haven't considered. I think what i really want is a local community i could tap into (i'm around Dallas) that could point out specific places i could go.

Just like having long everything haha. Past few months, I have been wearing leggings, womens jeans (front pockets lol, so I need to wear a jacket everywhere). I got some womens tshirts and shorts for the summer (wow they are WAY shorter than mens, probably won't shave my legs because its such a hassle). So far the leggings, short shorts could at least be excused away as slightly feminine exercise clothes as I see athletic guys sometimes wearing them. I also got a pair of unisex converse (converse shoes seem pretty unisex in general) and some women's socks but they are only slightly feminine IMO, solid white or black with some colorful stripes. I actually tried on some flats in a store, it wasn't crowded but it wasn't empty, hopefully nobody cared. I really wanted to try on some strappy sandals but I was too afraid. I have tried womens underwear before but just not a good fit for my junk. But I got a pair of flyless micro briefs and some trunks, they remind me of womens underwear.

I like my beard but sometimes I want to just shave it all off and try on a skirt, pantyhose and a pair of flats. But my family is conservative, they already dislike the fact that I wear leggings now. They haven't even seen me in the shorts shorts yet. I can't imagine them being happy about that. also I never want to shave my beard ever again! I love it too much! When I go outside people do give me looks, but I can't tell if its my hair, or beard or pants that is drawing their attention. Right now I like my viking look, but sometimes I want to look like all those gorgeous women I see in the street. My interest in women's clothes is definitely sexual though. For some reason in my mind, to be feminine is to be beautiful and sexy. I wish I could somehow be able to switch between appearances from slightly feminine looking male and feminine looking female. Just somehow would not feel right if I wore skirts and heels while rocking a beard. Also I have fragile emotions so I definitely would not be able to cope with the harassment and criticism.

edit: welp I got these sandals

Regardless, I am sometimes too embarrassed to express myself femininely when I am around other people. This happens with even the most ordinary of things. For example, I have been buying women's clothing that is somewhat passable as guy's clothes and even wearing this around my roommates makes me feel ashamed or afraid that they will notice I am wearing women's clothing. I don't really know how to handle this. I know a lot of people will probably say I shouldn't care what others think and I should just be myself but it is hard to when it comes to these things.

90,2017-03-14 22:39:32,5zfi3p,2,4,"Hey gang! I had a great weekend this weekend and I had a shitty weekend last weekend and I wanted to share these experiences with you. I'm AMAB and I'm genderqueer/genderfluid. My sex is male and I am very happy being male and I don't want to transition to female, however when I wake up in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress. Hair and makeup is too much for me but I love doing my nails. I'm also an albino and I am blind.

It started last Thursday when I went to see my doctor. You see I'm on this huge mission to improve myself both mentally and physically so I thought I'd get started by losing weight and getting my diet right so I can start working out at the gym in a few months. I've got a few other steps to take before I get to that point. Anyways, I've been weighing myself at a friend's house because he has a digital scale and I can easily read the numbers. I replaced the batteries to ensure I'd get accurate readings. When they weighed me at the doctor's office, they were telling me I was about 8 pounds heavier than I thought I was. The scale at home told me I was 166 and the doctor's scale was telling me 174. I asked the nurse if I could pull the scale into the exam room so I could weigh myself like I do over there and he said sure. (BTW: the nurse is really cute and I have a hard time resisting the urge to hit on him!) I stripped off my clothes and stepped up on the scale and fiddled with the weights until I got it balanced. 172 was the magic number. This made me feel sad because I was so thrilled to be below 170. I know it's only a couple pounds but I've been working really hard at eating the best I can and staying away from sweet treats (I feel bad, I get an apple juice and a peanut butter egg). Finding this out pretty much let the air out of my tires.

Fast forward to the next day and I get on the bus and see my favorite bus driver. I tell her what happened at the doctor's office and I told her that I feel fat and sad today. She started laughing hysterically and I couldn't figure out why and it was starting to irritate me a little bit when she calmed down somewhat and told me that I'm having PMS! I was like ""Whaaaaaat?!?!?"" She said all the symptoms I described are about how she feels when her Aunt Flo comes to visit once a month. I started giggling and told her that I'm so much like a woman! It made me feel a little bit better but all weekend long it kinda nagged at me and I didn't start feeling better until about Tuesday of this week. On Saturday I did do something fun for myself in an effort to cheer me up a little bit. I had gotten some 8 guage circular barbells a few weeks ago and I stopped by a piercing shop to get them put back in my ears. It's been a loooooong time since I've worn earrings and since I can't see my own face in the mirror (it's like looking at a face of a mannequin) and the holes needed to be stretched a little bit, instead of ripping my ears off I opted to let a professional do it. After it was done, I was out and about running some other errands and I could feel the weight of them in my ears again and it started to put a smile on my face. Tuesday when I woke up and felt them, I was really happy I did it and it's encouraging me to get more piercings.

Fast forward a little further to Saturday night. I was on telegram with some friends and we started talking about doing nails and whatnot. We started making tentative plans to meet at a friend's place the next day but we never hammered out a time before I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning and we all started talking about it again and we nailed down a time to meet. I was about 20 minutes late getting there but I had such an awesome time! It was me and three other friends of mine, one girl, one guy, and one person. We spent the better part of the afternoon just gossiping, hanging out, smoking cannabis, drinking mimosas, and doing our nails. My guy friend didn't do his nails because he's an airplane mechanic and his nails would be destroyed the next time he went to work. He's also a little self conscious about it because he just recently started this job and he loves it. Later that evening I got hungry and walked down the street to Little Caesar's Pizza and came back with a bunch of pizzas for everyone. I also wanted to show off my new nails too! :) It's been awhile since I've seen these guys because I've been on a sabbatical of self improvement and I'm getting comfortable enough to start sticking my head out from under the rock I'm hiding at to start seeing people on a small basis. I really wanted to wait until I had the whole package (mind, body, and spirit) before I popped up again, but a lot of these people are like family to me and I've been missing my family as of lately. We're all going to a convention at the end of July and I so can't wait to go and see the rest of my family and make some new friends.

So that's it. I just wanted to share with you guys because I'm having such a blast being my true self and I hope this experience will give y'all the courage to start being the people you want to be. Y'all do me a favor and have an awesome day!

Take care!

93,2017-03-15 01:43:59,5zgj4g,4,4,"Hello! I’m AMAB, 22, gay, and have always identified as male, but I’ve begun to question my gender identity recently. I’ve never felt comfortable in all-male environments. I get very anxious and feel unsafe in male restrooms; almost as if I’m expecting to be attacked. Every time I’ve had to be in a male dorm, like on sleepaway trips at school or summer camps when I was younger, I clammed up completely, had no interest in socializing at all, and would just have a general sense of dread and not-belonging. Any activities the boys would do to establish camaraderie among themselves would repulse me, and I wanted no part in them. I never spoke unless I was spoken to, and even then I would make myself as brief and scarce as possible for self-preservation. Conversely, when I was around girls, I would open up significantly, making jokes and being very social (by my standards at least). 

I always thought I felt this way around men because of my sexuality, but there were other gay men around at those times, and they did not seem nearly as averse to socializing with other men as me.
This discomfort has definitely bled into my more recent life too, I was the only male employee at my job for about a year and never felt an ounce of discomfort about it. I in fact prefer there being no other men. I still find it very difficult to have conversations with most men I meet; I either get super nervous if they’re gay/effeminate/attractive (fearing they won’t like me back) or super uncomfortable if they’re straight. Either way I tend to say little to nothing at all to other guys irl.

There’s also my complicated relationship with my hair. It was very long from about age 12-15, essentially because I refused to go to the barber (again, only men there). Then I cut it off, which made me feel sexier, but in a more conventional way I guess? But I always kind of liked it long more, so I grew it out again. It’s more “me”. Now my hair almost reaches my belly button, and I’ve recently had the strong urge to style it in very feminine ways.
I also have become VERY dissatisfied with my frumpy masculine wardrobe, and want to experiment with more feminine clothing and accessories. I hate wearing suits and ties. I find them so boring and they make me blend in with the other men which I REALLY dislike.

I dreaded learning how to shave when I started getting facial hair because I saw that as too masculine an activity. I still hate the act of shaving but I now like my beard, and my body hair in general (I’m very hairy).

I currently present very masc (most people can’t tell I’m gay unless I tell them) but if people were to refer to me as she/her, that would not bother me at all. A waiter gendered me as female recently (he only saw me from behind) and it annoyed me at first but the more I thought about it the more I liked it. I don’t know if she/her fits me more than he/him, but I’m fine with either atm. I also am uncomfortable with people referring to me as a “man”. “Gay man” and “male” are fine, but “man” by itself really irks me. There are just so many associations with that word that I don’t identify with.

I recently searched some feminine names for myself and fell in love with two. Like, they really excited me to a level I wasn’t expecting.

Anyway, I’m mainly posting here to share my story and get some help finding a label for myself. If anyone else here can relate to any of this, or give me some suggestions for labels I’d appreciate it :) I know they aren’t necessary but I personally would like to find one that fits.

It's a complicated feeling and I still don't entirely understand it, but I'm coming to accept it, and slowly learning how to express it so that other people might begin to understand. Generally, I look like a feminine man wearing women's clothes. Although I more identify as a masculine woman wearing woman's clothes, I feel like I more or less make my point.

Not everything has been perfect since I came out. I went out during the daylight hours this last weekend and I was met with my fair share of stares. I live in Tampa, which isn't exactly a bastion of progressivism (even on the St. Pete side of the bridge, where I was, even though it's generally better there). There were even some guys on the street who approached my girlfriend and I who were borderline hostile. My family doesn't accept me or my ""alternative lifestyle"", and I still haven't been able to bring myself to come out on facebook or to people at work who aren't sympathetic or accepting. Nevertheless! I wouldn't take it back for anything. Not for a moment.

This weekend I participated in an alternative fashion show and not everybody there was 100% on board with me or what I was doing or how I looked but by the end of the night, everybody was at least willing to accept me for what I am, and they gave so much love. I keep looking at the pictures. I can't stop. I'm still having a hard time believing it's actually real. That I'm really doing what I'm doing. Yet here I am. There is photographic proof, and I couldn't be happier about it.

I couldn't even imagine this would be my life a year ago. Not in my wildest dreams. I am out. So out. I've dreamed of this, flirted with it, pretended that it wasn't what I wanted, done literally everything except actually coming out of the closet for 27 years. Wow. Yet here I am. I feel beautiful. I feel like, you know when you find the last corner in a particularly large jigsaw puzzle? Something like that. The puzzle isn't totally put together but there is hope! For the first time in my life I genuinely feel like there is hope for me to be actually, genuinely happy.

I've found acceptance in places I could have never dreamed. All because I finally put on a dress and stepped outside. I went outside! I faced the world! And for the most part the world greeted me with a giant hug! I never, never, believed for a moment this was possible.

I have an amazingly accepting girlfriend and I know that I'm lucky. So lucky. It's scary and exciting especially because I've been down this road before and felt this love before and been betrayed by the allies who said they supported me. Discovering that the people who claimed to accept you were mocking you behind your back is painful in a way I'm sure you can imagine. I was so scared of that happening again that I hid for almost a decade. 

Maybe you've been there before, maybe not. All I can say now is don't give those people any purchase in your life or happiness or self acceptance. You are who you are. You are beautiful the way you are. Be happy. It's worth it. Yes, even with all the love around me I have to remind myself sometimes, but it's still worth it!

As queer humans, despite politics, despite hate, despite everything, or maybe even because of it, this is our time. Do not hide! There is no time or use for shame or self doubt. Let's show the world that we are here and we will not be silent. Let's show the world that there is another way, that life isn't binary, neither are we, and we will not submit to a life with arbitrary walls. 

I love each and every one of you, genuinely, and hope with all of my heart that this brings you strength and happiness and positivity.

130,2017-03-24 02:51:20,616k9d,1,8,"My name is Jake, I am a Pisces (if you can't tell lol).  I just turned 28 recently, AMAB, I'm big into music and video games.  I'm engaged, with two young boys. I'm also big into metaphysics and new age stuff. I'm not religious, but I am spiritual.

I've decided to create this account to post here after lurking for week.  I believe I am genderfluid and am hoping (in part) to receive some validation because I do not know any genderfluid people in my life, although I have a friend who is intersexed (I think that's the right term? I'm new to all of this) who has been extremely helpful through this all.

I started questioning about last Thursday and started researching shortly after that. From everything I could find, the term that sit best with me was Genderfluid.  I came out to my best friend who I have known for 15+ years and the first words out of his mouth were ""That doesn't surprise me. At all."" So yeah, I was shocked more than he was lol

We talked in depth, and I told him my fiance didn't know yet and that I wanted to experiment a little with clothing and whatnot to see how it made me feel.  The next night I dressed up after shaving my beard and modeled a few outfits and took pictures (that I might be inclined to share, if you guys want to see them).  I decided I liked it.  I felt good.  I felt sexy, and feminine.  

The next day (or two? everything is a blur) I suffered from extreme anxiety.  Anxiety so bad that it hurt me, mostly my chest, hips and butt.  I was walking around in near constant pain, and I can only assume this was a form of dysphoria.  The only thing that seemed to help was dressing up. I also had a moment where I saw a super cute girl in a restaurant who looked like she literally could have been female me and I had a panic attack and had to leave the room because I was freaking out and thinking I could never look cute like her.

Well, my fiance ended up outing me before I was ready to face her (which ended up being great timing because who knows when I would have said something, I was worried.)  Basically, she was very accepting, although she is having a little trouble adjusting.  She bought me an adorable R2D2 nightie for my birthday (which after coming out I told her was what I had my eye on), and surprised me with a cute top yesterday when she came home.

After coming out to my fiance, I felt like I had been missing a part of me and didn't even know it was gone until I found it again.  I was excited to call myself genderfluid. I thought it was awesome!  I was happier than I had been in a long while, and wanted all the cute clothes.  I was going to visit stores just to look at cute clothes, I was thinking about piercing my ears, and I was feeling a compulsive urge to shave my legs. I was seeing synchronicities everywhere, too.

Then I had a moment yesterday, where (as I described it to my fiance) I have a gender slider, and it usually sits at like 75% female and ebbs and flows around there. This basically had my slider at 50% and swinging erratically and wildly from center to either side, and it short circuited and caused me to ""shut down"". I had to hide under the blanket until I rebooted because I didn't want to see my body. I was full blown panic attack and couldn't do anything but curl up in a ball.  I eventually calmed down, but my whole body was sore and I was exhausted.

Then today I've just felt crummy.  I've just kind of been ""here"". Today has kind of been a garbage day.  Just one thing after another of crap (but no anxiety today, so I guess that's good), eventually ending with me very depressed and on the verge of tears.  We live with my mother due to financial issues and she just returned from vacation very early this morning (she had been gone the entire time the questioning/etc had been going on, and her being back might have to do with my crappy day) so I was worried about dressing, but by the time I got home I said screw it and put on my R2D2 nightie and a comfy pair of panties and I slowly started feeling better and that leads to here.

I just turned 28 recently, AMAB, I\'m big into music and video games.  I\'m engaged, with two young boys. I\'m also big into metaphysics and new age stuff. I\'m not religious, but I am spiritual.\n\nI\'ve decided to create this account to post here after lurking for week.  I believe I am genderfluid and am hoping (in part) to receive some validation because I do not know any genderfluid people in my life, although I have a friend who is intersexed (I think that\'s the right term? I\'m new to all of this) who has been extremely helpful through this all.\n\nI started questioning about last Thursday and started researching shortly after that. From everything I could find, the term that sit best with me was Genderfluid.  I came out to my best friend who I have known for 15+ years and the first words out of his mouth were ""That doesn\'t surprise me. At all."" So yeah, I was shocked more than he was lol\n\nWe talked in depth, and I told him my fiance didn\'t know yet and that I wanted to experiment a little with clothing and whatnot to see how it made me feel.  The next night I dressed up after shaving my beard and modeled a few outfits and took pictures (that I might be inclined to share, if you guys want to see them).  I decided I liked it.  I felt good.  I felt sexy, and feminine.  \n\nThe next day (or two? everything is a blur) I suffered from extreme anxiety.  Anxiety so bad that it hurt me, mostly my chest, hips and butt.  I was walking around in near constant pain, and I can only assume this was a form of dysphoria.  The only thing that seemed to help was dressing up. I also had a moment where I saw a super cute girl in a restaurant who looked like she literally could have been female me and I had a panic attack and had to leave the room because I was freaking out and thinking I could never look cute like her.\n\nWell, my fiance ended up outing me before I was ready to face her (which ended up being great timing because who knows when I would have said something, I was worried.)  Basically, she was very accepting, although she is having a little trouble adjusting.  She bought me an adorable R2D2 nightie for my birthday (which after coming out I told her was what I had my eye on), and surprised me with a cute top yesterday when she came home.\n\nAfter coming out to my fiance, I felt like I had been missing a part of me and didn\'t even know it was gone until I found it again.  I was excited to call myself genderfluid. I thought it was awesome!  I was happier than I had been in a long while, and wanted all the cute clothes.  I was going to visit stores just to look at cute clothes, I was thinking about piercing my ears, and I was feeling a compulsive urge to shave my legs. I was seeing synchronicities everywhere, too.\n\nThen I had a moment yesterday, where (as I described it to my fiance) I have a gender slider, and it usually sits at like 75% female and ebbs and flows around there. This basically had my slider at 50% and swinging erratically and wildly from center to either side, and it short circuited and caused me to ""shut down"". I had to hide under the blanket until I rebooted because I didn\'t want to see my body. I was full blown panic attack and couldn\'t do anything but curl up in a ball.  I eventually calmed down, but my whole body was sore and I was exhausted.\n\nThen today I\'ve just felt crummy.  I\'ve just kind of been ""here"". Today has kind of been a garbage day.  Just one thing after another of crap (but no anxiety today, so I guess that\'s good), eventually ending with me very depressed and on the verge of tears.

135,2017-03-26 16:45:09,61mhxs,0,16,"Dear: Strangers from last night

What's a girl to do all alone and not wanting to go home?
Just wander the street until the sense of loneliness just crushes her and she breaks down in the middle of the

street.


You spotted me crying my eyes out or more accurate my wailing sounds. You asked if I was okay I could of lied said yes; but I shook my head.

 You asked me if I just wanted to walk with you. I was hesitant really,but I followed along.
You and you're friend stood outside the pizza place asking all sorts 
of questions. 


If I was okay and what was wrong etc. I didn't really open up just enough of to say that ""I was feeling trapped in my own life"" 


And, they said that coming out was hard and just all my general anxiety , fears etc would pass and that I would be okay and I was worth it etc.


Anyway I was awkward and felt bad that I was holding them up. They reassured me that they were fine. One of them handed me their business card and at that point I was just going to head off to 

wander again. 

But, what I ended up doing was following them through invitation to the gay bar they were hanging out at. 


Once I got there they introduced me to some other friends of theirs. The lady insisted I should have some of the pizza they bought and the man wanted to buy me a drink. Initially I heisted, but I just ended up shrugging my shoulders and saying okay.




Anyway it was a pretty good time. I engaged with some causal conversation with these strangers that were nicer than they had any right to be.


At one point I was chatting with the one lady that had invited me along and she again reassured me that ""I was going to look great"" and that her sister in law had transitioned. She asked me if I could see it I shaked my head no not really. She responded that I was going to great you may not feel it but you see just a glimmer of it don't you she asked? I said yes. 


She was just overall positive telling me I was worth it and everything was going to work out. 
Also just the fact that she was a fan my style. 


Later she left and I decided it was time for me to get going as well. We walked for a couple of blocks. 

She hugged me and I told her I felt better. She said if I needed to talk I should get in contact with her friend who has given me his business card earlier. Anyway she was off and so was I. 




But, to the kind strangers last night you probably won't read this, but thank you. 

I did email the one that gave me his business card a nice thank you. But, I just wanted to get off my chest to share the story of the kindness of strangers. I probably won't ever see them again, but I won't forget them and their kindness. 


They didn't really have to do what they did, but they did it. So, thanks for the drinks,pizza and most importantly the kindness.

136,2017-03-26 20:24:23,61nq90,7,21,"Hi folks,

I've probably posted here a few time but just wanted to get a few things off my chest. I've been questioning my gender identity for about 6 months now. I've been through a lot of labels (both binary and non-binary identities) but have settled in some kind of genderqueer nonbinary realm.

I feel that I am gender neutral, which is something I've thought a lot about. I'm uncomfortable with my chest so do plan on wearing binders in future. I have a chosen gender neutral name that I prefer, and I don't like being called feminine pronouns (I'm AFAB). I feel less uncomfortable with masculine ones but gender neutral pronouns (like they/them or ze/hir) would make me so much happier. I also have tried packing (I'm still really on the fence about this). Basically I'm making a lot of changes in my gender expression to find what's more comfortable. 

I do have pre-existing mental health conditions such as social anxiety, something I've factored in to my discovery process. Basically at the moment, it just feels like *everything* is so gendered. I don't like being referred to as female, perceived as a woman. Yet I think womanhood is amazing and a supportive community. It's really confusing.

I've been doing a lot of research and over the course of this time, I have read so much negativity and hate towards the nonbinary/genderqueer community. So much so I think that I've internalised a lot of this. 

I'm trying to just stick with an identity something people would understand, that I'm just a gender nonconforming woman. But I feel like that's dishonest. I don't know what my discomfort with gendered language (such as woman, girl, lady, miss etc) stems from but it feels a lot like social dysphoria. 

I feel a lot of guilt if I choose to transition socially and legally because I would potentially change my name and pronouns, both would be hard work and I feel like people would think I've spent too much time on Tumblr, I'm just going through a phase (I'm 23 years old) or that I just want to be different. When in truth, I wish I could be more comfortable as things are, or at least have my gender identity respected without the fuss. Just carry on as normal.

I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences anything similar, not wanting to make changes as it would be problematic or wondering if they're just gender nonconforming cis people in denial for some reason!",genderqueer,"Dealing with a lot of guilt and confusion, as I assume most people do",1490585063.0,"{'created_utc': 1490559863, 'id': '61nq90', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 21, 'selftext': ""Hi folks,\n\nI've probably posted here a few time but just wanted to get a few things off my chest.

167,2017-03-31 21:33:31,62ob81,2,9,"So as you can probably guess from the title, I'm genderqueer, but in many senses, I'm still trying to come to terms with it for a variety of reasons I'd like to just get out there if you don't mind.

So for the longest time, I've identified as a cisman. In a lot of ways, I still do, and I feel comfortable with that and don't feel any sense of regret or otherwise dysphoria for doing so in my 23 years of life. At the same time, I've started to understand the more feminine aspects of myself. If anything, this comes out more in my behavior: delicate sort of movements with my hands, chipper and outgoing attitudes towards others, tenderness, etc. Of course, just writing that, I sort of take issue with, because it's a fucking shame that behaviors that are traditionally coded female men can't explore and are often faced with violence and even killed for displaying any sort of femininity. 

At the same time, I have no real desire to even present myself as female or even present in feminine coded ways. I feel perfectly comfortable having a beard, having broad shoulders, wearing jeans and plaid because, well that's what I feel comfortable with. If anything, I only want to call myself genderqueer just so people don't mistake my experience with my body and gender with that of a cisman. But if it were my perfect world where people don't experience violence for the way they present themselves or for who they are, I wouldn't really call myself any gender besides the gender that only I occupy, which of course grows and moves where I grow and move. I don't feel like any gender really quite fits my actual experience with my identity and my relationship to the world, even genderqueer feels like a limiting sort of identification for me.

It really started to hit my yesterday when I was watching a documentary on Judith Butler who was talking about her gender experience and she said (and I'm heavily paraphrasing), ""Do I subscribe to everything the lesbian and gay movement says? Do I come out as a lesbian and gay person first before I identify as a woman, a Jew, a philosopher? No. It's not the only identity. So these are communities where one belongs and one does not belong."" and ""I've never felt at home in my gender. I'm sure other people have. To me gender is ambivalence."" In so many ways, that was really applicable to so many of my experiences as a biracial Mexican-American, as a someone who presents male, as a genderqueer person, as someone who is bisexual, etc. Nothing really quite fits and I don't really feel like any label and any label I've given myself doesn't fit. Even calling myself a nonman doesn't feel right. 
If anything, genderqueer seems to just be a decent catch-all term to at least contextualize something. 

I've had an unfortunate experience trying to talk about my gender stuff with someone who recently came out as a transwoman, and honestly, it felt kind of invalidating and made it harder for me to talk about. I felt like I was being pulled into one way simply because she thought her experience was universally applicable to mine, so I haven't talked to the queer circles I'm a part of since, because I don't want to feel that invalidated again by anyone, cis or trans.

I said this to my girlfriend the best, ""If I could call myself a gender that was just my name and then live my life as I want to, I'd feel at home."" That's really the only thing that actually makes sense to my experience. And more than anything, I'd just like some people to acknowledge that as valid. Then I can feel justified in living my life as a male-presenting genderqueer person who goes by he/him pronouns because why not and that's what I'm the most comfortable with. Just don't assume I'm a man because of that, which admittedly is a bit of a social snafu I'm putting myself in, but that's what makes me the most comfortable and I don't want to apologize for this because I don't really feel like I should. All gender experiences are valid, including mine, so don't try to force me or anyone else one way or another.

27,2017-03-14 22:37:16,5zfhmg,2,4,"Hey gang! I had a great weekend this weekend and I had a shitty weekend last weekend and I wanted to share these experiences with you. I'm AMAB and I'm genderqueer/genderfluid. My sex is male and I am very happy being male and I don't want to transition to female, however when I wake up in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress. Hair and makeup is too much for me but I love doing my nails. I'm also an albino and I am blind.

It started last Thursday when I went to see my doctor. You see I'm on this huge mission to improve myself both mentally and physically so I thought I'd get started by losing weight and getting my diet right so I can start working out at the gym in a few months. I've got a few other steps to take before I get to that point. Anyways, I've been weighing myself at a friend's house because he has a digital scale and I can easily read the numbers. I replaced the batteries to ensure I'd get accurate readings. When they weighed me at the doctor's office, they were telling me I was about 8 pounds heavier than I thought I was. The scale at home told me I was 166 and the doctor's scale was telling me 174. I asked the nurse if I could pull the scale into the exam room so I could weigh myself like I do over there and he said sure. (BTW: the nurse is really cute and I have a hard time resisting the urge to hit on him!) I stripped off my clothes and stepped up on the scale and fiddled with the weights until I got it balanced. 172 was the magic number. This made me feel sad because I was so thrilled to be below 170. I know it's only a couple pounds but I've been working really hard at eating the best I can and staying away from sweet treats (I feel bad, I get an apple juice and a peanut butter egg). Finding this out pretty much let the air out of my tires. 

Fast forward to the next day and I get on the bus and see my favorite bus driver. I tell her what happened at the doctor's office and I told her that I feel fat and sad today. She started laughing hysterically and I couldn't figure out why and it was starting to irritate me a little bit when she calmed down somewhat and told me that I'm having PMS! I was like ""Whaaaaaat?!?!?"" She said all the symptoms I described are about how she feels when her Aunt Flo comes to visit once a month. I started giggling and told her that I'm so much like a woman! It made me feel a little bit better but all weekend long it kinda nagged at me and I didn't start feeling better until about Tuesday of this week. On Saturday I did do something fun for myself in an effort to cheer me up a little bit. I had gotten some 8 guage circular barbells a few weeks ago and I stopped by a piercing shop to get them put back in my ears. It's been a loooooong time since I've worn earrings and since I can't see my own face in the mirror (it's like looking at a face of a mannequin) and the holes needed to be stretched a little bit, instead of ripping my ears off I opted to let a professional do it. After it was done, I was out and about running some other errands and I could feel the weight of them in my ears again and it started to put a smile on my face. Tuesday when I woke up and felt them, I was really happy I did it and it's encouraging me to get more piercings.

Fast forward a little further to Saturday night. I was on telegram with some friends and we started talking about doing nails and whatnot. We started making tentative plans to meet at a friend's place the next day but we never hammered out a time before I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning and we all started talking about it again and we nailed down a time to meet. I was about 20 minutes late getting there but I had such an awesome time! It was me and three other friends of mine, one girl, one guy, and one person. We spent the better part of the afternoon just gossiping, hanging out, smoking cannabis, drinking mimosas, and doing our nails. My guy friend didn't do his nails because he's an airplane mechanic and his nails would be destroyed the next time he went to work. He's also a little self conscious about it because he just recently started this job and he loves it. Later that evening I got hungry and walked down the street to Little Caesar's Pizza and came back with a bunch of pizzas for everyone. I also wanted to show off my new nails too! :) It's been awhile since I've seen these guys because I've been on a sabbatical of self improvement and I'm getting comfortable enough to start sticking my head out from under the rock I'm hiding at to start seeing people on a small basis. I really wanted to wait until I had the whole package (mind, body, and spirit) before I popped up again, but a lot of these people are like family to me and I've been missing my family as of lately. We're all going to a convention at the end of July and I so can't wait to go and see the rest of my family and make some new friends.

So that's it. I just wanted to share with you guys because I'm having such a blast being my true self and I hope this experience will give y'all the courage to start being the people you want to be. Y'all do me a favor and have an awesome day!

Take care!

I was under the impression that your sexuality is to be ideally determined by the gender of the person you are attracted to, not sex. For example, if I as a straight woman were to date a pre-op FTM partner I would still be in a straight relationship. I would assume labeling this otherwise would be disrespectful against my partner's gender. 


Thus, as someone who is genderfluid, how could you be gay unless you were also attracted to other genderfluid people? Otherwise you would be gay as defined by your sex, which would be disrespectful to your own gender identity?

41,2017-03-21 08:01:44,60mcgs,2,7,"Sorry, wall of text ahead.

To start, I don't identify as male, but I don't feel comfortable identifying as female either (yes, I'm genderfluid). I occasionally switch but for the most part I'm content to consider myself as containing both genders simultaneously. It's a complicated feeling and I still don't entirely understand it, but I'm coming to accept it, and slowly learning how to express it so that other people might begin to understand. Generally, I look like a feminine man wearing women's clothes. Although I more identify as a masculine woman wearing woman's clothes, I feel like I more or less make my point. 

Not everything has been perfect since I came out. I went out during the daylight hours this last weekend and I was met with my fair share of stares. I live in Tampa, which isn't exactly a bastion of progressivism (even on the St. Pete side of the bridge, where I was, even though it's generally better there). There were even some guys on the street who approached my girlfriend and I who were borderline hostile. My family doesn't accept me or my ""alternative lifestyle"", and I still haven't been able to bring myself to come out on facebook or to people at work who aren't sympathetic or accepting. Nevertheless! I wouldn't take it back for anything. Not for a moment.

This weekend I participated in an alternative fashion show and not everybody there was 100% on board with me or what I was doing or how I looked but by the end of the night, everybody was at least willing to accept me for what I am, and they gave so much love. I keep looking at the pictures. I can't stop. I'm still having a hard time believing it's actually real. That I'm really doing what I'm doing. Yet here I am. There is photographic proof, and I couldn't be happier about it.

I couldn't even imagine this would be my life a year ago. Not in my wildest dreams. I am out. So out. I've dreamed of this, flirted with it, pretended that it wasn't what I wanted, done literally everything except actually coming out of the closet for 27 years. Wow. Yet here I am. I feel beautiful. I feel like, you know when you find the last corner in a particularly large jigsaw puzzle? Something like that. The puzzle isn't totally put together but there is hope! For the first time in my life I genuinely feel like there is hope for me to be actually, genuinely happy.

I've found acceptance in places I could have never dreamed. All because I finally put on a dress and stepped outside. I went outside! I faced the world! And for the most part the world greeted me with a giant hug! I never, never, believed for a moment this was possible. I came out to my parents! My southern baptist family knows who I am, and they are not okay with it but they're dealing with it? They didn't disown me?

I have an amazingly accepting girlfriend and I know that I'm lucky. So lucky. It's scary and exciting especially because I've been down this road before and felt this love before and been betrayed by the allies who said they supported me. Discovering that the people who claimed to accept you were mocking you behind your back is painful in a way I'm sure you can imagine. I was so scared of that happening again that I hid for almost a decade. 

Maybe you've been there before, maybe not. All I can say now is don't give those people any purchase in your life or happiness or self acceptance. You are who you are. You are beautiful the way you are. Be happy. It's worth it. Yes, even with all the love around me I have to remind myself sometimes, but it's still worth it!
As queer humans, despite politics, despite hate, despite everything, or maybe even because of it, this is our time. Do not hide! There is no time or use for shame or self doubt. Let's show the world that we are here and we will not be silent. Let's show the world that there is another way, that life isn't binary, neither are we, and we will not submit to a life with arbitrary walls. 

I love each and every one of you, genuinely, and hope with all of my heart that this brings you strength and happiness and positivity.

One love. One human race. &lt;3

tl;dr Be strong! Be happy! Share love!

I keep looking at the pictures. I can\'t stop. I\'m still having a hard time believing it\'s actually real. That I\'m really doing what I\'m doing. Yet here I am. There is photographic proof, and I couldn\'t be happier about it.\n\nI couldn\'t even imagine this would be my life a year ago. Not in my wildest dreams. I am out. So out. I\'ve dreamed of this, flirted with it, pretended that it wasn\'t what I wanted, done literally everything except actually coming out of the closet for 27 years. Wow. Yet here I am. I feel beautiful. I feel like, you know when you find the last corner in a particularly large jigsaw puzzle? Something like that. The puzzle isn\'t totally put together but there is hope! For the first time in my life I genuinely feel like there is hope for me to be actually, genuinely happy.\n\nI\'ve found acceptance in places I could have never dreamed. All because I finally put on a dress and stepped outside. I went outside! I faced the world! And for the most part the world greeted me with a giant hug! I never, never, believed for a moment this was possible. I came out to my parents! My southern baptist family knows who I am, and they are not okay with it but they\'re dealing with it? They didn\'t disown me?\n\nI have an amazingly accepting girlfriend and I know that I\'m lucky. So lucky. It\'s scary and exciting especially because I\'ve been down this road before and felt this love before and been betrayed by the allies who said they supported me. Discovering that the people who claimed to accept you were mocking you behind your back is painful in a way I\'m sure you can imagine. I was so scared of that happening again that I hid for almost a decade. \n\nMaybe you\'ve been there before, maybe not. All I can say now is don\'t give those people any purchase in your life or happiness or self acceptance. You are who you are. You are beautiful the way you are. Be happy. It\'s worth it. Yes, even with all the love around me I have to remind myself sometimes, but it\'s still worth it!\nAs queer humans, despite politics, despite hate, despite everything, or maybe even because of it, this is our time. Do not hide! There is no time or use for shame or self doubt. Let\'s show the world that we are here and we will not be silent. Let\'s show the world that there is another way, that life isn\'t binary, neither are we, and we will not submit to a life with arbitrary walls. \n\nI love each and every one of you, genuinely, and hope with all of my heart that this brings you strength and happiness and positivity.\n\nOne love. One human race. &lt;3\n\ntl;dr Be strong! Be happy! Share love! \n', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Acceptance', 'created': 1490108504.0}"

Basically as context, I'm 99% sure I'm not cis at this point, and I still get that occasional ""Hmm, am I right about that?"" and question myself every now and then when I feel male (though I've become more comfortable with it since last month and I'm questioning it less and just accepting it). I also started a journal that I write in to try and understand myself day to day, and I've noticed that there are actually days when I feel agender, which is interesting, since I didn't think I felt that before I started the journal. I've also came out as questioning to my close friends, and they were so accepting I actually felt humbled! I'm glad to have such great friends!

Anyway, there are times when I feel female when I start thinking ""Maybe I'm actually transgender?"", and I've heavily considered the issue. After all, for some reason I seem to enjoy (in a way) feeling female more than feeling male (AMAB), but I've dismissed it since I don't really experience any dysphoria, I just would have *preferred* to have been born female. Is this normal?
Also, the other day I read a post where someone described themselves as ""Feel too female to be a male, but feel to male to want to change my body or anything"", and I feel like I relate to that quite a bit, especially when I feel more female.
Interestingly, too, in those times when I start to think I may be transgender, I get this feeling that I *want* to be transgender rather than genderfluid, which is odd, because I know this thing isn't a choice (I don't even get a choice on what gender I feel like from day to day). It makes me afraid that I sound like a faker typing that, but I'm just trying to be as honest as possible.
I think another part of the issue is that I think that people would be more accepting if I was transgender than if I was genderfluid, but I also don't want to let other people's perceptions interrupt how I feel about myself

Also, I'm still as afraid as I was last month that this is just a phase in growing up (I'm 16, will be 17 in the next month) and that I'll come out as genderfluid (or transgender, I'm still questioning, but I'm 99% sure I'm not cis) and then when I'm like 25 I'll be looking back at my 17 year old self and realising how wrong I was, and I'll be afraid to approach my teenage friends and be like ""yeah... I was wrong, I'm actually cis"". On the other hand though, I realise that this kind of thing is hard to just put down as being a phase, as gender identity is fairly permanent, and I can imagine myself still being genderfluid when I'm 25. I can imagine myself being genderfluid in 10 years, but I can also see myself being cis, it's strange. Does anybody have any advice on this? Is this a sign that I'm actually cis or is it normal when questioning? I don't want to seem like I'm questioning myself for the trend or anything, but occasionally I question whether I'm genderfluid at all or if I'm just a poser (especially when I feel male)

Could you please be as honest as possible in your answers; I'd rather be told I'm wrong than believe something that's not true

I really appreciate all the help I've gotten from this subreddit so far, and I'm eternally grateful! Thank you all so much! :)

Okay, so background: I'm 21, AMAB, and started questioning my gender about two-ish years ago when I learned about trans people and transitioning, and it suddenly seemed like the feelings I'd had since puberty made perfect sense. I then spent about a year questioning whether or not I actually wanted to do anything transition-wise. Eventually, I decided to talk a bit with a therapist to figure out where I wanted to go next, which led me to set up an appointment for feminizing hormone therapy. At the time, I wasn't entirely sure if I was binary, but I knew I was uncomfortable with the gender I'd been assigned and figured I'd see where transition led me.

Skip ahead four months from when I started Spiro/Estradiol, and now I'm having a bit of trouble. I was feeling pretty shit this past weekend to start with due to a sinus headache. But it got even worse yesterday when I woke up and found that the breast development I've gotten, which I'd always been happy about before, was causing a familiar sense of dysphoria.

I've spent the past two days basically just wondering what to do from here. Even with the newfound chest dysphoria, my previous dysphoria over masculine features like body/facial hair and genitals didn't seem to drop at all. It was like I just didn't want *any* gendered features. Then, come this evening, I reexamined of my breast development and decided I honestly wouldn't mind if they were a bit larger. :/

So now I'm wondering if this was a one-time thing brought on my the general misery that accompanied my sinus headache, or if this shifting gender identity is something I should expect to come up every now and then for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, I don't really have access to a gender therapist from my current location; although, I do have my university counseling center, which is full of LGBT allies who I should at least be able to talk to for some general support.

**TL;DR:** I guess I'm looking to learn about other people's experiences with genderfluidity so I can hopefully get a better idea of where I'm at and what options I might want to research. Any personal stories, advice, links to relevant resources, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

(One other thing that may or may not be relevant/make sense: I did kinda suspect I might have some not-entirely-binary gender identity based on past introspective experiences. A few years back, I developed two internal ""ideas of self"" - if that makes any sense. One version of me was female; the other was genderless. So I figured that perhaps my actual gender identity lay somewhere in between those two. I didn't really think there was a chance it might be *both* of them.
