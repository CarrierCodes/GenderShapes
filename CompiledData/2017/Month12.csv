I was wondering if my specific description of my gender experience will ring any bells regarding an existing identity or wordage for the mildly complex ideas within. I haven't quite found any labels that match up perfectly, on the quest as it were hehe.

If all of my gender experience was broken down into a grouping of three parts, one third would be masculine, one third feminine, and the remaining third would be empty. In other words, the Masculine &amp; Feminine can be identified as bigender/dualgender--but I feel as if I don't experience or am influenced by my gender as much I could potentially be as a human in (USA) culture. So there's this (maybe agender) bit, but calling that trigender feels like I'm identifying heavily with the empty space, when that space seems more to serve as an example in the fraction model.
Then part of me wonders if the space is more of a gender neutral presence, I can't put a finger on it. The space in the 3/3 example feels both irrelevant BUT important to the equation (almost becoming a presence through its necessity.) 

Maybe I'm searching for a term that describes someone who experiences their gender in a small way. 
I feel like I'm playing and experimenting with it a lot (mentally and behaviorally, not just in expression.) My worldview is kinda like, I feel like a genderless soul in a cool flesh suit, and with that soul being filtered through an animal brain with chemicals the gender more or less is either developed, or heightened from a base personality concept.

Any thoughts on the matter are super appreciated. I don't get to talk about these topics with other folks often. This board seems super cool!!

11,2017-12-02 14:21:00,7h2uui,4,13,"Hi. I'm Ash, AFAB, about to turn 34, and just found out yesterday that I have stage 1 endometrial cancer. Apparently this isn't as scary as it sounds because it's curable - it just requires a hysterectomy, most likely a total one. 

This is something I've actually been thinking about as a possibility anyway as a potential way to handle some of my dysphoria -- my biggest triggers are gendering things like potentially being pregnant or getting my period or getting noticable five o'clock shadow (thanks, pcos). I'm on medication that helps reduce the facial hair and I went without a period for seven years, which was great. I was worried my obgyn would want me to go on birth control to handle my recent unexplained bleeding and I'd be in a bad place all over again.

My time on BC involved a lot of pain and a lot of emotion and weight gain and just bad stuff. Going off it was even worse but it was nice not bleeding even if it helped cause my current situation. So not having to worry about it sounds kind of amazing in some ways...but I've never had surgery and am terrified because cancer is scary.

I guess my reason for posting is wondering if any of my enby siblings have been through this (with or without the cancer diagnosis) and have anything they can tell me about actually going through this procedure personally. Because thinking about it while freaking out about bleeding all over the place is one thing, but having it happen is something totally different. 

-------

Tldr- I've been idly thinking of getting a hysterectomy to balance out some dysphoria but my daydreams are turning to reality in the very near future because it will cure my cancer. Looking for reassurance or advice or something.

23,2017-12-04 08:17:01,7hg0x8,3,17,"When I was 15, I read through descriptions of various gender identities and decided that demigirl sounded right. I didn't really think about it much after noticing that, though, and never mentioned it to anybody.

When I was 19, I spent some time trying to figure out what people meant when they talked about ""just knowing"" they were whatever gender. There were no neon arrows in my brain saying ""this gender feels right and all others feel wrong"" or whatever. I decided I was probably agender or something. I didn't come out to anybody, and I only thought about it on and off.

I'm 20 now. At the beginning of October I got a binder on a whim and wearing it felt really right. This made me wonder whether it was a gender thing. I'd strongly found myself relating to a few fictional trans men recently, which hadn't felt significant before but seemed kind of like it might be now. So I spent a lot of time online trying to figure out what felt right. I found myself posting on r/ftm (on a different throwaway), mentioning my experience, and desperately hoping they would tell me I was a trans guy. Which, you know, seemed like another pretty solid piece of evidence that I was a trans guy. So I went to the mall and got some men's clothes and I love love loved the way they looked on me and fit me in the binder. So I spent most of October and early November thinking of myself as a guy, with a new male name and he/him pronouns. It was really easy to make the switch, although there were some things I didn't like (not wearing nail polish or short shorts). Anyways, I came out as trans to my parents and best friend in early November, with a plan to go on hormones in January. My best friend was super great about it and my parents were less thrilled, but also it was clear that they'd eventually be accepting.

After coming out, I felt like I had made a huge mistake and permanently ruined my life. I wanted to go back to female name and pronouns. So I un-came out a few days after I came out. I figured that I was actually a butch woman; I still liked men's clothes and binding, but I'd misunderstood the reasons for those. I went back to thinking of myself with my old female name and she/her pronouns, and it was just as easy to make the switch as it had been before. And it felt really good to re-add some feminine things into my life. I saw my family for thanksgiving and I felt good being one of the women.

I felt happy and settled in my identity for a couple weeks or so after that. I've been really enjoying pairing men's clothes with nail polish, lipstick, and earrings. That combo is basically what I've been wearing every day for the past three-ish weeks, and it's felt very good.

But... for the past week or so I've been feeling like something's off. The idea that I am a cis girl, that that's who I am and probably who I've always been, makes me unhappy. It's like... I wish I was a trans guy. I've seen in a few places wisdom like ""cis people don't wish they're trans"" and ""if you've spent a ton of time questioning, that's a good sign that you're not cis."" Which makes sense. But also I'm pretty sure trans people don't immediately regret coming out as trans despite a lack of negative reactions, feel relief at reversing the coming out, and feel happy being seen by family as their birth gender. So I'm not entirely sure where that leaves me, but the nonbinary subreddit seemed like a good next step.

Here are some options that I'm considering
1) I'm a cis girl who strongly relates of the narratives of trans men due to internalized misogyny preventing me from relating to women. I really loved the idea of being a trans man because all of the clothing changes I had made so far had made me feel happier and this seemed like proof that being trans would make me happier. When I came out, it was the first time I faced real consequences instead of this being a fantasy, and that's why it felt wrong. 
2) I'm a trans guy who was moving too fast with coming out so soon after figuring out my identity. I got scared by making so many rapid changes, and I was afraid that coming out as trans would mean I lost or changed my relationships with my friends and family. I've gone back into denial and moved into my comfort zone.
3) I'm agender. I've been mistaking liking various societally-gendered things as identifying with the binary genders themselves, and I lack an actual internal gender. I liked the idea of being a trans guy because it seemed like it would provide me with a certainty about gender that I'd never felt before, but actually stating an allegiance to one gender over another felt wrong because I didn't actually have an internal sense of gender.
4) I'm bigender and/or genderfluid. The reason I'm having so much trouble pinning down my gender identity is because it's actually different at various moments in time. I was feeling particularly male in October, but coming out as a guy felt wrong because I also have a female side.

They/them pronouns don't feel right (they're actually worse than both she/her and he/him, I think?) and I'm not particularly drawn to attempting to be androgynous, so that's one thing ruled out at least.

I want to keep using she/her pronouns and my feminine name, at least for the most part. I plan to do that and continue dressing for the most part in masculine clothes and feminine accessories. It seems like if I know how I want to outwardly present my gender, I don't need to actually identify the internal feelings behind it... but thinking of myself as a girl still feels wrong, and I get this bad sinking feeling in my chest when I think about gender, and it really bothers me that there's this part of myself that's a mystery. It's like a bruise; I know that poking at my gender to figure out what's going well is just going to result in more turmoil, but I can't stop doing it until there's a point where I can think about my gender without this much turmoil.

I guess what I'm asking is... how do I figure out what my gender actually is? A lot of advice suggests figuring out your desired gender presentation (what clothes you want to wear, etc) but I'm feeling pretty good about that; my issue's more of figuring out which gender my outward presentation is linked to. All four options I mentioned above seem extremely likely, even though they're also all contradictory, and arbitrarily picking one doesn't feel like a great way to do this.

29,2017-12-06 10:21:13,7hx675,29,0,"Hello,

I am writing this post as I am currently in a rather delicate situation and I am in serious need of help/clarifications/advice.

First of all, I am a cisgender straight male in my 30s. Straight as an arrow, in fact. Always been, most likely always will. 
I grew up in a very conservative and traditional family, which means that I had a very binary approach to gender, sex, and whatnot. To me the world was very simple - either you are male, or female, gay, or bi. That's all - four options, anything more than that is unnecessary.

As a straight male, I like females. Period. No question. Simple. I also technically like lesbians or bi females, as my survival instinct still tells me that their bodies allow reproduction, thus I feel sexual attraction.

This being said, I have been recently challenged by individuals who clearly have issues with this restrictive system - and invited me to open my mind and realise that there are lots of people who simply do not fit into these simplistic categories. 

Note that this is a VERY recent thing. I am still bound (""shackled"", as some might say) by my beloved binary world, and letting go is stupidly hard. 

Now, this would just be an academic exercise anyway - as I am still a cisgender straight white male, brought up in a wealthy western family. The epitome of privilege, some may think. It is just a matter of looking at this new, complex system - and accept it for what it is - accept that a lot of individuals feel the need to broaden this shallow binary system. Easy, as long as it does not involve you or challenges your own identity.

However, recent circumstances led me to enter a relationship with a girl, who defines herself as agender. Note that I am using female pronouns here, because I don't know what else to use and, frankly, using anything else makes me even more uncomfortable so I avoid it for my own sanity.

Now, this may be nothing to you - but you must understand that to me this is a big deal. A huge one. 

I define myself as straight. I am attracted to females and the thought of physical contact with a man (unless it is a manly fistfight) makes me nauseous. I am not exaggerating. 

I am now faced with a terrible question.

Am I still straight? Would being in a relationship with someone who is agender (but of female sex, obviously) make me something else? 
Does being attracted to a female body override the being in a relationship with a non-female-identified person? I would say yes, as if I had in front of me a very attractive female sentient android I would probably still want a relationship with it even if technically agender, but here we are talking about other humans, not things. As I said above I am also still attracted to the female body regardless of the gender identity of the person that inhabits it (lesbians), but a relationship with them could never actually happen. Also, as far as I understand, sexual orientation and gender identity are separate anyway, so....I am confused. What am I attracted to and where does that put me in this new complex system that may be too convoluted for me?

Again, I understand that all of this may sound close-minder and whatnot. But please try to understand my situation. It is not easy for me.

What are your thoughts?

Thank you.

Straight as an arrow, in fact. Always been, most likely always will. \nI grew up in a very conservative and traditional family, which means that I had a very binary approach to gender, sex, and whatnot. To me the world was very simple - either you are male, or female, gay, or bi. That\'s all - four options, anything more than that is unnecessary.\n\nAs a straight male, I like females. Period. No question. Simple. I also technically like lesbians or bi females, as my survival instinct still tells me that their bodies allow reproduction, thus I feel sexual attraction.\n\nThis being said, I have been recently challenged by individuals who clearly have issues with this restrictive system - and invited me to open my mind and realise that there are lots of people who simply do not fit into these simplistic categories. \n\nNote that this is a VERY recent thing. I am still bound (""shackled"", as some might say) by my beloved binary world, and letting go is stupidly hard. \n\nNow, this would just be an academic exercise anyway - as I am still a cisgender straight white male, brought up in a wealthy western family. The epitome of privilege, some may think. It is just a matter of looking at this new, complex system - and accept it for what it is - accept that a lot of individuals feel the need to broaden this shallow binary system.

35,2017-12-07 07:32:35,7i4u57,7,4,"This turned into quite the rant, sorry.

For quite some time now I've identified as agender, but the reason is making me question if that's really who I am. I've tried to dissect my feelings, and this is the conclusion at which I've arrived:

I find sex revolting and traumatic; thinking about it too long (more than a few seconds in a not-vague/abstract form) turns into a panic attack, and libido/arousal feels disgusting. Gender is often linked with sex (not to say that sexuality correlates with gender, per se, but certain stereotypes are sexualized and I haven't seen agender people sexualized nearly as much as gender-identifying people). Because I want to get away from anything to do with sex, I want to separate myself from gender. At some point I'd like to have surgery to remove my genitals without replacing them with the binary alternative; and if at all possible, at the same time remove any libido or sex drive.

During the time I was on HRT and actively anorexic (right now I'm eating more but it's a struggle, I want to ""relapse"" and I can't entirely convince myself that would be a bad thing), my hormone levels were extremely low (just above male range estrogen, low female range for testosterone). This made me very happy, and I suspect (I need to make an appointment for follow-up blood work) that my estrogen levels have been increasing as I eat more (my libido is coming back, for one).

I'd love to have both sex hormones reduced to 0 or near 0, but I haven't been able to find anything on Google regarding low sex hormones aside from ""reduced libido"" (very desirable) and bone density loss (not so desirable); safety is a concern, but I haven't been able to find any resources regarding anything I could take that would prevent bone density loss aside from increasing one sex hormone or the other.

If absolutely necessary, I will allow my estrogen levels to increase, though I despise the idea of feminization. I'd like to avoid that outcome if at all possible.

That's not to say I'm aromantic; but the form of romance I would want might not be a healthy one—I just want someone to rely on to make me feel safe and valid, and while I would reciprocate as much as possible, I don't know how much I really have to offer; on the other hand, I would also want someone who would rely on me in the same way—but not the same person (and I would be happy to be in a 3-person relationship, though at the same time can't help feel that it's wrong—all my life I've been taught that ""civilized people are monogamous"" and I guess that's really stuck with me).

I've spoken to a therapist about this stuff, but only in fairly vague terms; I don't feel comfortable bringing up stuff from my past without anonymity, and the thought that there might be consequences for certain people if the therapist felt the need to take action is concerning.

TL;DR: I'm worried that trauma might be steering me away from binary transgender feelings (MtF) and ""making"" me agender; and from what I've been able to piece together from introspection, this seems probable.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm unsure if I should just ""get over it"" (the therapist's advice, the same as with anorexia) and let my estrogen increase and hope I can overcome this at some point in the future, or if I should let these feelings be valid, not question them, and do what makes me comfortable right now.

And also because i have no idea what a label for this would be, like i definitely do feel male, i like my chubby male body and face(minus the current genitals, luckily that is solvable) but not like 100% male, maybe something like 80% male 20% female?

I am talking to a gender therapist about this and apparently he has seen people like that before, says like 3 people every year looking to do this. And we pretty much ruled out being transsexual since i dont have the signs of one and i knew that already but we have yet to find out what deep reason causes these feelings. Luckily he understands the importance of the matter and is talking with some known surgeons in Thailand that would be able to do this surgery for my specific case.

Anyway here's my experience, i think the first sign there was something different with me when probably in early puberty where the mere thought of my sticking my penis anywhere was repulsive and utterly wrong, it just didnt fit ""me"" to do anything like that so i started thinking myself as a kind of exclusive bottom gay guy.

Then i remember i first stumbled upon a guy who had mtf surgery and lived as a man on the internet and everything just felt fitting for me to be something like that, as in it made sense and i remember researching a lot about it because it felt like something i should do, i didnt have many strong feelings about it like i do now but i did feel i should do that in the future. Sadly the more time i spent researching the more i found out people saying that there was no way to get this surgery done outside of back alley surgeons and you had to pretend to be an mtf transgender to get it done which needed a year of female hormones. And since i didnt have the resources and was pretty disappointed i kinda put that plan on the backburner consciously.
Too bad my mind apparently wasnt satisfied with that because after some time i started having trans thoughts, that they would often focus on having a vagina and even though i just didnt like the idea of being a woman i tried to say that it was some kind of internalized misogyny because these feelings wouldnt stop, but after some time i realized that i simply didnt like the idea of being a woman in my every day life, not even once and it wasnt any internalized misogyny causing this, it was just me not fitting with that image. That caused me a great deal of confusion and similar repeating trans thoughts that only disappeared once i started thinking about being a man with female genitals more seriously instead of just something silly i wanted to do, and only then did everything just make sense and all forms of trans thoughts disappeared. 
Only after accepting that i felt a lot more secure about me in general and who i am, because everything just fitted perfectly though my feelings about wanting to get this operation done are a lot stronger about it. And i dont see this as a very sexual thing, it is more of a feeling that i need to have that genitals and live my life like that since i dont intend to be having that much sex since im not a very slutty person in general lul

I've always wanted to change my name since as far back as I can remember... but ever since I came out as NB, picking a new name had CONSTANTLY been on my mind. It was a big stressor for me, to be quite honest. I had talked about going by Saige with my girlfriend and we both liked it a bit. But then I realized that if my first name was Saige, that means my first/last name would be Saige Frances. (Frances is my legal middle name, but I have good feelings connected to it, so I decided I wanted it to be my last name.) The problem with Saige Frances is that a spoken word/hip hop artist that I like is called that (spelled differently though). Soooo.... yeah. Awkward. No way. I kept thinking of other names that I could use, but nothing ever felt like it fit. So I went with a fairly gender neutral name that I loved the sound of. Avery.

48,2017-12-10 20:33:45,7iwjqj,8,12,"Hey everyone! I got a question for you.
I'm AMAB and came out something like 2 months ago (only to me, and to my girlfriend) as genderqueer/nonbinary/agender. This was weird, but great. I can finally put some words on what I am, and I am (sometimes) happy with myself.

But.

The problem is I'm not really out, and I can't really express as I want. I still looks like a man, and aside from some sweaters and t-shirts that come from the woman aisle, there is nothing that could tell I'm not cis when you look at me.
I'm not ready (and probably never will) to be out at work and in my small town, and this is why I can't really change the way I look. I have more freedom at home, where I began to express a little more as I want.
This begins to be a problem as I am more and more open on my gender identity when I'm home. When I am outside/at work, it makes me think I'm just a cis-male who is looking for problems he doesn't have. I know expression is really different from gender identity and everything. But still. A lot of people even in the LGBTQ community are saying that genderqueer people are fake, or just liberal bulshit. And in the pro-genderqueer / pro-enby media productions, you always see those cool queer and androgynous looks that makes you think this is the only way you should express your gender as a non binary person.

So, finally, here is my question. Sorry if it sounds dumb:
How can I ""feel"" more androgynous everyday in my gender expression, without being obviously queer to my coworkers and my neighbors?
I already want to upgrade my cool socks collection with a cool tights and stockings collection to wear under my jeans. But aside from that, I can't really see what I could do without being too visible to other people.

So I'm a trans girl, and I've been on hormones for a little over a year.  I've kinda leaned toward more gender neutral / androgynous presentations because I just feel more comfortable in general that way.

Back when I was for all intents and purposes a cis guy, I actually tried to deny my being trans because I really did genuinely enjoy being masculine sometimes, and I kinda was stuck in the whole binary view of gender.

Nowadays, I like feeling masculine sometimes and I like feeling feminine sometimes, but I mostly like kinda being in between.

That said though, I also want to be female bodied.  Like androgynous, but also female bodied.  Does that just make me a trans girl?  I know labels are kinda what you make of them, but I've kinda reached the conclusion if I were born AFAB, I would have definitely identified as genderqueer at the very least.

 As a result, I usually use occupation titles or physical descriptors (e.g. ""I'm phoning my representative"" or ""do you see the kid decked out in BTS gear?"", which proves to be effective in most contexts.

Additionally, in a casual setting, I sometimes use words neutrally that originally referred to males, i.e. guys, dude, etc., but I would rather avoid these terms to avoid harm.

Furthermore, what is one to do in regards to honorifics? Unless they are doctor, a person is usually referred to as either Mr. X, Ms. X, or Mrs. X.

One day, I was talking to my grandma about Queer Issues. It’s already heavily established that I’m pan as fuck, and I’m confident in that part of my identity. When we got to the discussion of trans issues, my grandma said that she’s always felt like a woman – and asked if I did, too. Well, she was more like, “Haven’t you?” meaning she expected a yes. It was rhetorical, because I’m into traditionally feminine things. I love makeup, I love dresses, and I presented as femme pretty often.

My response was unexpected – like, so unexpected that I didn’t even see it coming. “Uh, yeah, I mean mostly.”

She’s obviously confused. I’m like, “oh shit.” She tells me to talk to my therapist, I say it doesn’t bother me, and I go to think about it.

It’s been a while since that discussion. I think it’s been a year? Maybe? I have no concept of time. Ever since then, I’ve been thinking about it nonstop. I remember being fifteen – four years ago – maybe even younger and thinking about how cool it would be to have a binder. I think about all the times that I’ve been jealous of my cis girl best friend being perceived as andro. I remember trying to bring up the fact that maybe I’m not a girl and just dropping it because I didn’t feel like getting into it. I think about a lot of things.

And then comes the dreaded Imposter Syndrome Thoughts.
Here’s the big problem I’m facing. I feel like I don’t have enough dysphoria. I understand that not everyone has it, and I really don’t care whether someone lacks it because it’s not my business. But here I am. I absolutely don’t have any bottom dysphoria – genitals just really don’t bother me. I don’t even really think about them. But there are times where I have some Rough top dysphoria. It’s just so rare, though. I really hate it when others point out my chest, and I hate calling them breasts to the point where I didn’t even like typing that. But I can point them out fine? Most of the time? And I don’t really care if someone refers to me by she/her pronouns. I’d prefer they/them but I don’t get dysphoria from it.

I’m just really confused. There’s not a day that goes by without me thinking of what the fuck is going on, and it’s been like that for a while now. I keep thinking about coming out, but then I’m scared I’m just faking. I can’t wait for the day that I can get a binder, just so I can go as masc when I feel like it, but what if I’m just butch?

Even writing this I’m confused. I think I’m NB. I like being NB. The idea of being seen as andro even when I’m leaning heavily femme or masc brings me joy. I want to be able to wear makeup and a dress and still have people question what gender I am. That’s my goal. But I’m still just. Feeling weird, I guess? Do cis people ever feel like this? Is this just an average thing? Could someone help me out?

I don't believe in gender as an intrinsic quality, I believe that it is a cultural one, shaped by social expectations and various experiences. 


Gender is to my mind entirely seperate from sex (other than the ways in which it is culturally percieved to be connected) and that Gender *IS* Gender Presentation (in how one presents themselves to themselves), it isn't a choice persay (because your perception of it is cultivated by things outside of your control), but is socially constructed rather than somehow intrinsic (coming from genetics or some kind of a-priori soul), which to me is fine because identity studies is very important to me, i don't think it has to be intrinsic to be valid, so many valid and important human experiences are constructed in that way. 

To me, neither man nor woman captures what I am, i feel as if I have traits of both (and that this is true of most people) in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable identifying as either gender. I find myself often splitting my avatars in games and the like with a 50-50 balance, or deciding on them based entirely off other aesthetic concerns (lack of a slender male body type virtually guarantees i'll select a female character, for instance). 


I do idealize a world where Gender isn't as meaningful as it is today, more like a personality question, and that comes to me from another part of me which is very important: my feminism, I resent gender roles and a lot of the baggage that comes with it when you describe yourself using a gender and think that no one really fits into these categories as they're understood. For a little while, after meeting some non-binary people I identified as such, viewing my own identity as a rejection of gender as it's understood in society, a sort of gender-atheism, but then stopped because I didn't feel secure doing so when i realized some people seem to view their non-binary identity as it's own category on a list of possible genders. Like ""are you a Man? Woman?

75,2017-12-14 18:42:01,7jtmz2,6,31,"As someone who quite regularly wears breastforms, I can say that they're pretty cool. I can also say that buying my first pair was a big step and that I ran into a lot of problems I could not really find an answer for. I hope that, by sharing my experiences here, some people who are looking to buy breastforms can get a better idea of the issues they might run into and what they have to look out for. 

It has been a few years now since I bought my first pair of breast forms. I live in a small-ish country in Europe, where Amazon or eBay don’t really exist. Buying breast forms therefore, was easier said than done. Most of the breast forms I found on the internet, were the full-on medical-grade prosthetics. Being a student, they were way out of my league price-wise. After an extensive search, I found a fetish shop that sold breast forms as well. They had a little web shop, so I could have ordered them online, but I had no idea which size I had to buy and, since they were still over 100 euros, I decided to be bold and go visit the brick and mortar fetish shop, so I could compare sizes and decide if I thought they were worth the money. They were. [Lo and behold (NSFW)](http://imgur.com/9oagsyP)
[From a different angle, still NSFW](http://imgur.com/LfPvuLw)

Probably because of the feeling that I had to overcompensate for the masculinity of the rest of my body, I went a bit overboard with the size. I bought E-cup breast forms and even though I have pretty broad shoulders, they were on the large side. I wasn’t too bothered by that though. I was never going to go outside and the bigger size meant they were softer and bouncier than a smaller size would have been; not a bad thing, in my experience. 

**My first bra**
But, of course, breast forms are pointless if you have nothing to hold them in the place where actual breasts would preferably go. I had a low-impact sports bra at the time, which wasn’t really up to the job of holding 1200 grams of silicone in place. I decided to go online and buy myself a bra. I knew a full cup bra would be the way to go, so that my breast forms wouldn’t fall out of the top of my bra if I leant forwards, and decided to go for a padded T-shirt bra. This however, caused some issues. I measured my ribcage and decided that I would need a 90E bra. The circumference turned out to be spot on: it was tight, but definitely not uncomfortably so, at the most outwards set of hooks. It was the cups that did not agree with my breast forms. Even though the number in a bra size represents the circumference of your ribcage, and not the width of your breast, people with a larger circumference, will most likely have wider breasts. The cups of a 90E bra therefore, are quite wide. Breast forms, on the other hand, are measured in projection size only (perhaps this is not the case for the medical-grade ones, but the cheaper ones come in projection sizes only). This means I did not buy 90E breastforms, but E-size breastforms. As it turns out, my breast forms were way too narrow [for the cups of a 90E bra](http://imgur.com/An67Sgl)

Another issue with breast forms and a padded bra is that, even though breast forms are quite squishy, they are not as malleable as natural breasts. This wouldn’t be too much of a problem, were it not that the curve of the cups of my bra was completely different [than the curve of my breast forms](http://imgur.com/SuoIKet)

My breast forms had to sit quite high up in my bra therefore, making them spill over the top even in a full cup bra. 

**My second bra**
Since cups of my first bra were way too wide, and since the shape didn’t work either, I decided to go for a non-padded, wireless sports bra as my second bra. This bra had no cups that could be too narrow or the wrong shape, so it seemed perfect. And it was. At first. The problem with a bra with no cups however, is the uniboob effect: everything gets squished to the middle, were it becomes one big, unrecognizable mass. This problem is way worse if your breasts are connected in no way, shape or form, which is why this plan did not really work either. 

**My third bra**
The third bra I bought, was a bra with underwires and non-padded, full-coverage cups. I bought it in a 90D because I measured myself and was actually somewhere in between an E and a D. This bra turned out to be spot on. It hold everything in place wonderfully, was reasonably comfortable and worked with the shape of my breast forms. I am quite pleased with how they [turned](http://imgur.com/4YnfJXV) out to [look](http://imgur.com/WFgOy92) with the right bra. 

**From here**
What is lacking still, is a way to sleep with breast forms. It happens quite often that I don’t want to take off my breasts at the end of the day. Sleeping with an underwired bra however, is far from ideal, so I’m still looking for a way to make that work. 

**ps**
One additional problem with boobs that aren't attached: you can end up sitting on one and cause [this](http://imgur.com/2qhEefs).

as the title says, I'll come out - not sure how, when and if - before it's important to be 100% sure.

Anyway, I'm 60% sure I'm non-binary, 20% not sure trans-femme and 20% queer. The issue about being 100% non-binary is from my opinion how society gives gender to everything. FYI, I'm amab.

The first step into NB was in 2016, when I got myself a short female haircut. Male haircuts pissed me off. Next step was buying female gloves for cycling - something I've been forced to because of my small hands.

Since summer 2017, I'm doing stuff to appear more feminine. A reason, why I'm not 100% sure about calling myself NB. The goal is to appear feminine, because most male stuff makes me bored/sad/angry, female stuff instead makes me happy.

The point why I struggle to call myself trans-femme is because if there wouldn't be a gender labeling the female stuff, I'd be just someone who wants some kind of clothes/styling/haircuts and has some kind of body. So that's the heavy point, why I think I'm non-binary, even though I'm changing into more ""feminine"" appearance.

For my mind I've made some online-tests (Cogati or how it's called, not just 5 question-lifestyle-magazine) and the results have been from ""feminine male"" to ""androgynous"". There's a lot of stuff considered male/masculine, which doesn't fit to me. So it's not just my looks but also my mind, which seem non-binary.

For the longest time I thought I was just a cis but I wasn't. So I have presented more andro and tried but I feel attached to a lot of masculine traits and characteristics. I like have some muscle and some facial hair but I also want smooth skin and to wear make up. 

My wardrobe is all over place. I can't bring myself go wear dresses or skirts because I know I will be harassed by family of some friends but a lot of my shirts,  tops, sweaters and outerwear are unisex or on the feminine side. I size up on a lot feminine stuff to fit my masculine proportions and I like how they look but some times I default to what feels safe and what let's me pass..

It is with passing I feel like I am doing a disservice go others especially other enbys.  I don't want to feel ashamed of how I present and I want to be validated but I feel scared of appearing too. Out there. My make up is subtle. I swear skinny jeans that look more masculine or just unisex. No embellished pockets usually not super duper skinny. I default to converse sneakers even though I have some more feminine booties or boots with heels. I wear shirts with wider necklines but hide them under sweaters and flannel shirts.

I don't use my ""dead"" when I can avoid it but a lot of people know me by it and all my cards are in that name. I changed my name on all my social media besides Facebook but only a few people actually know me by my new assumed name others things it's just me being ""quirky"".

I guess all of this is me just feeling scared that I'm an imposter and that I'm compromising so much I am not being mg authentic self and also that I'm just a phony.

Also dating again as an enby is really difficult because I really don't have the patience to explain myself to people who don't already know. 

If anyone can just shed light or help me or encourage that'd be great. I like a lot and don't post often but I do follow a lot of what goes on.

Okay, so, I'm AFAB, and I have complicated feelings on my gender and stuff. I've never felt like a girl, and I hated it when people imposed their own standards of what girls should be like or womanhood on me. It's not that I felt like a boy, either, I just didn't feel like anything. 

I don't feel entirely comfortable with being seen as a girl, and sometimes I hate how feminine I can look, but it's more complicated than that, because I'm attracted to girls, and I find feminine girls very pretty, so a part of me is pleased at feeling like I match my beauty standards. 

And since I've always had people tell me what I can and can't do because of my gender, I've started sort of identifying as a girl as a sort of rebellion, if that makes sense? Like, your beliefs about my gender won't stop me from doing what I want.

When I imagine being AMAB, the thought doesn't bother me but it's not appealing either. The only difference I can imagine between being AFAB and AMAB is the socialization. I think I'd feel discomfort at being seen as very masculine, but that's also how I feel about being seen as very feminine. Like ideally I'd just have a body that's not masculine or feminine.

But it's more complicated than that, because I do feel like being socialized as a girl affected me, and when it comes to being a lesbian, I still feel identification with that term even if I don't feel entirely like I'm a girl. Like it's not entirely accurate to say I'm attracted to my own gender, but it's not entirely accurate to say I'm not.

I feel ashamed for being trans. I'm in constant denial of myself and it's hurts. I can not sleep because it's the only time I feel like I'm not judged when it's at night and everyone is asleep. I have an anxiety disorder, and I'm hyperaware of everyone around me and I'm afraid of being judged by everyone. I like a guy who is openly gay, he knows I'm questioning  (I even feel like I'm in denial saying that sentence), and we've had this sexual tension for over a year. It's been long enough that I know it's not one sided. Then I feel ashamed for even liking gay men or wanting to be a queer guy (idk if I'm binary or not), and liking someone who is effeminate. My dad acts like he's someone that shouldn't be taken seriously, and acts like it's ridiculous how he's acting. I didn't even connect this feeling to wanting to be transmasculine to this, I just thought I was a mistake and I shouldn't exist and I shouldn't be alive because I confuse everyone (except for this guy that I'm simultaneously trying to avoid and get closer to at the same time). But now that I'm starting to realize this about myself, I feel like a freak, like I'm disgusting and wrong and it's so fucking hard. My parents don't like it.

She's trying to be more inclusive to the NB-identified students in her class, and one way that she's trying to do this is by altering her data presentation. I gave her my opinion, but I'm only one NB person, so I'd love to hear how others feel about this topic. I'll put her questions in quotes below:

""My example datasets are of patients with some specific disease. Their gender was only recorded on a binary / male / female scale as a categorical variable. So to counter that, I showed my students (as part of data analyses) graphs like this: the colors of the box plot are in the nonbinary colors according to the official pride colors. So my first question to NB ppl is: 1) are they offended by me using NB color coding to make a point about situations that only made records on a male/ female status? Did I get anything wrong? Am I misrepresenting them?
2nd question) Are they offended by me using NB color coding to make a point about situations that only made records on a male/ female status? As of now, there are no datasets that record gender in a nonbinary state, so my lecturing will have to continue with M/F identifications, but I want to include the NB students in my class and I don't know how to do that.""

I gave her my opinion, but I\'m only one NB person, so I\'d love to hear how others feel about this topic. I\'ll put her questions in quotes below:\n\n""My example datasets are of patients with some specific disease. Their gender was only recorded on a binary / male / female scale as a categorical variable. So to counter that, I showed my students (as part of data analyses) graphs like this: the colors of the box plot are in the nonbinary colors according to the official pride colors. So my first question to NB ppl is: 1) are they offended by me using NB color coding to make a point about situations that only made records on a male/ female status? Did I get anything wrong? Am I misrepresenting them?\n2nd question) Are they offended by me using NB color coding to make a point about situations that only made records on a male/ female status? As of now, there are no datasets that record gender in a nonbinary state, so my lecturing will have to continue with M/F identifications, but I want to include the NB students in my class and I don\'t know how to do that.""\n\nThanks for any help! \n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Representation in statistics/data presentation?', 'created': 1513577577.0}"

I love more andro mens fashion but often find I am drawn to more feminine leaning clothes. I hate how a lot of default unisex items or trendy stuff is masculine leaning, because masc tends to be the default gender clothing category.

I love a lot of different styles so I don't know where to begin I am hoping someone can see the holes I can fill in  I guess I do different categories for organisation sake.


Hats- I wear a lot of beanie hats and dad hats when I do but find dad hats like the name are very masculine while beanies are universal. 



Outwear- I have a few denim jackets and also some longer coats that are more for the winter some fur trim type details and a boxier silhouette. I'm also fond of biker type leather jackets, recently found a silver one that is cropped pretty high though and not sure how to wear thing cropped to my natural waist. Trench coat, 


Sweaters- mostly cardigans and some with wider necklines or some drape to them mostly in neutral colors, black, brown, one in maroon.


Shirts- a couple simple floral button up shirts in softer thinner fabrics, a couple striped long sleeve nautical type shirts with stripes, a couple tees with wider neck lines and shorter sleeves also falling just below the waist just above the hip with slight flare. Flannel shirts mostly oversized


Pants/jeans- work pants that are kinda boxy and loose, skinny jeans that come to the waist in black, grey and dark and light blue, a couple pairs of boot cut/flared jeans, some cropped pants. Cargo pants, I want to try to find Collettes ( I think that's what I mean,  the looser cropped pants) I also have some leggings but they are mostly worn at home and not out 


Shoes ( probably the category that is the most all over the place) I have several pairs of converse all stars, some vans slip ons and high tops, doc marten derbies , black combat boots, cowboy boots in brown, some 1.5 inch side zips boots in black suede, black Chelsea boots also some random nikes like air force ones.

So this is kind of some of the things I am working with. I struggle a lot with footwear. I feel like most of my boots can be pretty unisex but I wish I knew how to wear more feminine boots, I don't feel like heels or flats would work me and my wardrobe, I want to get another pair of two with a slight heel but I don't quite know how to style them so if doesn't just like in wearing really feme boots, I found they look good with either super skinny jeans or slight flared jeans. Converse are great but I also feel like a teenager wear em. I was thinking of pennyloafers of some kind for another casual option.

Other thoughts. I know winter isn't a good time but I want to try cropped tee shirts not super cropped but maybe just a little skin and maybe worm under a cardigan or unbuttoned shirt or flannel, i have been expufementing with jewelry a lot too. I like simple cuffs and bangles, my watch is kinda masculine, I wear rings sometimes, I wear pendants and simple choker necklaces.

So if anyone can give any tips on improved my andro femme lean or just being more andro that would be cool. I'm not sure if this would be met well at any of the fashion subs so I turned here.

1,2017-12-01 07:18:18,7gth39,19,41,"I've been trying to think of a good first post in here, and didn't wanna do the classic ""hi"" post (not that there is anything wrong with those, just not my speed).  So, after a bit of thought, figured I'd just say what I've been going through the past few weeks, what lead up to it, and thoughts on the future.  I know this sub, like all trans-centric subs, gets a lot of curious lurkers, and maybe my story might help someone.

First, the basics.  I'm a 34yo AMAB.  I'm married to one of the best women on earth.  I work an entry level corporate job, and live with three room mates I consider good friends.

I have been some flavor of depressed all my life.  No suicidal ideation or self destructive tendencies (thank chickens, I don't know if I'd been strong enough to resist those), but just this constant feeling of, well, not right.  It was like I didn't belong, like I was always on the outside, and I certainly felt unworthy.  I hated myself.

I always, however, just chalked up the self loathing to poor life choices.  Didn't finish high school, didn't go to college, bad first marriage, bad with money, lazy, out of shape; all of these were what I believed was the source of all of it.  And this had gone on for a *long* time.

About two years ago, a good friend of mine publicly came out as trans.  I really value my friends; they are the family I choose.  So, I started learning about being trans, what it entails, the difficulties trans folk face, and so on.  I wanted to be there for them, so I had to know about all of this.

Interestingly, within a short time after that, a couple more of my friends also came out as trans, and I met some other trans friends through them.  I figured that, well, I've always known interesting people, I'm a geek and a gamer, isn't too odd that I know a bunch of trans folk.  That, and I'd been learning about what it is to be transgender, supporting my friends, so maybe I was just comfortable.

Now, some way, way back-story here, before we go on.  I've always liked feminine clothing.  I didn't tell too many people about this, but it has always been the case.  I was the early teen who tried on his mother's clothes when no one was home.  And in my late teens, I went through a ""cross dressing"" phase.  I was lucky enough to have some very open minded and caring friends, and I often went days presenting female at their place.

I knew one person trans at that point.  They were FtM, and they stayed with one of my friends for a time.  Being young, though, I just assumed they were a masculine lesbian, and didn't dig any further.

Eventually, I drifted away from those friends, and away from feminine clothing.  It didn't occur to me how comfortable I felt in them, and I pushed away the memories of wishing I could just live like that.

Now, add over a decade of time passed, a couple of failed serious relationships, and a ""meh"" series of jobs that generally have paid the bills well enough (not really). Toss in 80 or 90 pounds gained. Along with that, put a successful marriage I do not deserve, and am eternally grateful for.

I had recently, about six months ago, started dieting to lose weight, and have had some success.  I was feeling better about my self image, enough to try shaving my face, something I hadn't done in years.

A good friend and my wife were both curious about me cross dressing again.  They thought it would be fun.  My wife is a cosmetologist, wanted to maybe do my hair and make-up.  I wasn't feeling as fat as I have, so I agreed.

Well, I did, and got a look at myself, and things suddenly felt different.  Really different.  Better.  I felt good.  But the clothes weren't the only thing that changed.  My personality felt more open, I felt less weighed down, just, I felt...

...happy.  I felt happy.  I'd forgotten what it was like.

So, I realized I needed to talk to people.

I reached out to my trans friends.  I talked with them about my feelings, and they gently encouraged me to explore them.  Never anything heavy handed, never what they thought or didn't think I ""was"". Lots of questions and listening, lots of careful guidance towards introspection.

I first thought I was genderqueer.  Like, it has to be in the middle, right?  I'm a little of A, a little of B, somewhere around there.  And I did talk some with the lovely people in r/genderqueer, though I more read their posts, heard what they had to say.  They helped me a lot.

But it wasn't quite right.  I wasn't in the middle, or even a little to one side.  

My room mates were all understanding, and I began presenting feminine at home.  It quickly became an all the time thing when I wasn't out and about.  Unless someone was over who didn't know, I was lounging about in shorts and a camisole, doing chores in a sweater dress, whatever.   I stopped wearing briefs, started wearing panties all the time.  I got a bra.  I really like my bra.

I picked up a skin care routine, because I realized I really like to be pretty.  And there wasn't self loathing involved.  It wasn't ""you look like shit, fix it"".  It was ""I like being pretty and delicate, how can I get there more?"".  I started having an easier time working out, and my diet wasn't as much of a chore.

I had discovered motivation again.  I was experiencing ambition.  I have struggled with ambition for over a decade.

This pushed me to more talks with my friends, more thoughts, more discussion...

It was interesting where the revelation came from.  I had messaged one of my trans friends, and asked her ""Do you know any exercises that target and tone the pectorals, but don't work the arms very hard?"". 

Yeah, I know, that should been a revelation moment.  But it wasn't yet. It did, however, allow her to answer in the most witty way possible, which was to send a picture of the chemical composition of estrogen.

I loved the humor in it.  I'm a nerd, it was a science joke, it was great.  I showed my wife, she... didn't laugh.

She was suddenly concerned with what would happen if I decided to go on hormones.

So, we had a talk.  I told her I wasn't considering that at all, but hypothetically, we could absolutely look through what that would entail.  So I read up with her, looked into the physiological changes estrogen would cause.  I told her the truth, that no matter who I am, or realize I am, I still love her, and always will.  And that helped her, and she was better, and supportive.

And now, I had hormone therapy on the brain.  And how difficult it would be to get, *hypothetically*.  And how much it would cost, *hypothetically*.  And how long changes take, *hypothetically*.

And I watched videos, and I realized that my self loathing, and my lack of ambition, and my feelings of isolation and being on the outside, could all be marked up to gender dysphoria.

And I talked with my friends more.  And I asked myself more questions.  And I finally came to a conclusion.

And I contacted a lot of my friends, trans and not, and told them my revelation: I am a woman.  I am a trans woman.

And a lot asked if I was sure.

And I told them yes.

And a lot of them then said something to the effect of, ""Fucking hell, took you long enough to figure it out, we've known for months/years.  Congratulations, love.""

O_O

Apparently, I was one of the few surprised.

So, here I am.  I'm still not publicly out, but I know who and what I am, and it helps SO much.  It's like a limiter had been taken off my brain.  I'm happy. I'm actually fucking happy.

And I'm terrified.  There is so much ahead of me.  There are so many people in the world that already hate me, and they've never even met me.

But I am also amazingly lucky.  I have friends who are ridiculously supportive, and a wife who is not only overjoyed to see me happy again, but honestly gets a kick out of buying me clothes and shopping with me.

As of where I'm going, I'm doing what a few friends recommended, which is slowly edging towards public presentation.  I'm ""feminizing"" my masculine styles, slowly switching out of my old ""potato sack"" clothes, working my way I to the feminine side of androgynous for now.

I figure early next year, maybe February, I'll look into the medical side of things.  Talk to a doctor and a therapist.  Look into HRT.

Because, well, I'm a woman.  Always have been.  Just took me way too long to find myself.

Here's how it has gone.",1512137898.0,"{'created_utc': 1512112698, 'id': '7gth39', 'num_comments': 19, 'score': 41, 'selftext': 'I\'ve been trying to think of a good first post in here, and didn\'t wanna do the classic ""hi"" post (not that there is anything wrong with those, just not my speed).  So, after a bit of thought, figured I\'d just say what I\'ve been going through the past few weeks, what lead up to it, and thoughts on the future.  I know this sub, like all trans-centric subs, gets a lot of curious lurkers, and maybe my story might help someone.\n\nFirst, the basics.  I\'m a 34yo AMAB.  I\'m married to one of the best women on earth.  I work an entry level corporate job, and live with three room mates I consider good friends.\n\nI have been some flavor of depressed all my life.  No suicidal ideation or self destructive tendencies (thank chickens, I don\'t know if I\'d been strong enough to resist those), but just this constant feeling of, well, not right.  It was like I didn\'t belong, like I was always on the outside, and I certainly felt unworthy.  I hated myself.\n\nI always, however, just chalked up the self loathing to poor life choices.  Didn\'t finish high school, didn\'t go to college, bad first marriage, bad with money, lazy, out of shape; all of these were what I believed was the source of all of it.  And this had gone on for a *long* time.\n\nAbout two years ago, a good friend of mine publicly came out as trans.  I really value my friends; they are the family I choose.  So, I started learning about being trans, what it entails, the difficulties trans folk face, and so on.  I wanted to be there for them, so I had to know about all of this.\n\nInterestingly, within a short time after that, a couple more of my friends also came out as trans, and I met some other trans friends through them.  I figured that, well, I\'ve always known interesting people, I\'m a geek and a gamer, isn\'t too odd that I know a bunch of trans folk.  That, and I\'d been learning about what it is to be transgender, supporting my friends, so maybe I was just comfortable.\n\nNow, some way, way back-story here, before we go on.  I\'ve always liked feminine clothing.  I didn\'t tell too many people about this, but it has always been the case.  I was the early teen who tried on his mother\'s clothes when no one was home.  And in my late teens, I went through a ""cross dressing"" phase.  I was lucky enough to have some very open minded and caring friends, and I often went days presenting female at their place.\n\nI knew one person trans at that point.  They were FtM, and they stayed with one of my friends for a time.  Being young, though, I just assumed they were a masculine lesbian, and didn\'t dig any further.\n\nEventually, I drifted away from those friends, and away from feminine clothing.  It didn\'t occur to me how comfortable I felt in them, and I pushed away the memories of wishing I could just live like that.\n\nNow, add over a decade of time passed, a couple of failed serious relationships, and a ""meh"" series of jobs that generally have paid the bills well enough (not really). Toss in 80 or 90 pounds gained. Along with that, put a successful marriage I do not deserve, and am eternally grateful for.\n\nI had recently, about six months ago, started dieting to lose weight, and have had some success.  I was feeling better about my self image, enough to try shaving my face, something I hadn\'t done in years.\n\nA good friend and my wife were both curious about me cross dressing again.  They thought it would be fun.  My wife is a cosmetologist, wanted to maybe do my hair and make-up.  I wasn\'t feeling as fat as I have, so I agreed.\n\nWell, I did, and got a look at myself, and things suddenly felt different.  Really different.  Better.  I felt good.  But the clothes weren\'t the only thing that changed.  My personality felt more open, I felt less weighed down, just, I felt...\n\n...happy.  I felt happy.  I\'d forgotten what it was like.\n\nSo, I realized I needed to talk to people.\n\nI reached out to my trans friends.  I talked with them about my feelings, and they gently encouraged me to explore them.  Never anything heavy handed, never what they thought or didn\'t think I ""was"". Lots of questions and listening, lots of careful guidance towards introspection.\n\nI first thought I was genderqueer.  Like, it has to be in the middle, right?  I\'m a little of A, a little of B, somewhere around there.  And I did talk some with the lovely people in r/genderqueer, though I more read their posts, heard what they had to say.  They helped me a lot.\n\nBut it wasn\'t quite right.  I wasn\'t in the middle, or even a little to one side.  \n\nMy room mates were all understanding, and I began presenting feminine at home.  It quickly became an all the time thing when I wasn\'t out and about.  Unless someone was over who didn\'t know, I was lounging about in shorts and a camisole, doing chores in a sweater dress, whatever.   I stopped wearing briefs, started wearing panties all the time.  I got a bra.  I really like my bra.\n\nI picked up a skin care routine, because I realized I really like to be pretty.  And there wasn\'t self loathing involved.  It wasn\'t ""you look like shit, fix it"".  It was ""I like being pretty and delicate, how can I get there more?"".  I started having an easier time working out, and my diet wasn\'t as much of a chore.\n\nI had discovered motivation again.  I was experiencing ambition.  I have struggled with ambition for over a decade.\n\nThis pushed me to more talks with my friends, more thoughts, more discussion...\n\nIt was interesting where the revelation came from.  I had messaged one of my trans friends, and asked her ""Do you know any exercises that target and tone the pectorals, but don\'t work the arms very hard?"". \n\nYeah, I know, that should been a revelation moment.  But it wasn\'t yet. It did, however, allow her to answer in the most witty way possible, which was to send a picture of the chemical composition of estrogen.\n\nI loved the humor in it.  I\'m a nerd, it was a science joke, it was great.  I showed my wife, she... didn\'t laugh.\n\nShe was suddenly concerned with what would happen if I decided to go on hormones.\n\nSo, we had a talk.  I told her I wasn\'t considering that at all, but hypothetically, we could absolutely look through what that would entail.  So I read up with her, looked into the physiological changes estrogen would cause.  I told her the truth, that no matter who I am, or realize I am, I still love her, and always will.  And that helped her, and she was better, and supportive.\n\nAnd now, I had hormone therapy on the brain.  And how difficult it would be to get, *hypothetically*.  And how much it would cost, *hypothetically*.  And how long changes take, *hypothetically*.\n\nAnd I watched videos, and I realized that my self loathing, and my lack of ambition, and my feelings of isolation and being on the outside, could all be marked up to gender dysphoria.\n\nAnd I talked with my friends more.  And I asked myself more questions.  And I finally came to a conclusion.\n\nAnd I contacted a lot of my friends, trans and not, and told them my revelation: I am a woman.  I am a trans woman.\n\nAnd a lot asked if I was sure.\n\nAnd I told them yes.\n\nAnd a lot of them then said something to the effect of, ""Fucking hell, took you long enough to figure it out, we\'ve known for months/years.  Congratulations, love.""\n\nO_O\n\nApparently, I was one of the few surprised.\n\nSo, here I am.  I\'m still not publicly out, but I know who and what I am, and it helps SO much.  It\'s like a limiter had been taken off my brain.  I\'m happy. I\'m actually fucking happy.\n\nAnd I\'m terrified.  There is so much ahead of me.  There are so many people in the world that already hate me, and they\'ve never even met me.\n\nBut I am also amazingly lucky.  I have friends who are ridiculously supportive, and a wife who is not only overjoyed to see me happy again, but honestly gets a kick out of buying me clothes and shopping with me.\n\nAs of where I\'m going, I\'m doing what a few friends recommended, which is slowly edging towards public presentation.  I\'m ""feminizing"" my masculine styles, slowly switching out of my old ""potato sack"" clothes, working my way I to the feminine side of androgynous for now.\n\nI figure early next year, maybe February, I\'ll look into the medical side of things.  Talk to a doctor and a therapist.  Look into HRT.\n\nBecause, well, I\'m a woman.  Always have been.  Just took me way too long to find myself.\n\nAnywho, if you\'ve read through all this, thank you.  If you\'re lurking in here, unsure of who or where you are right now, I hope it helped.

My teacher and me were talking recently about how peoples' decisions are based on how they were raised and sometimes not how they actually feel.

As the title suggest, I'm gender confused, and while nobodies opinion on here replaces professional help, I'm kind of in a position where professional help isn't affordable, so it would be nice to hear some opinions on my situation.

When I was a kid, for as long as I can remember I wanted to be a a girl. There were three girls my age that lived on my street when I was a kid, and they were my friends growing up. I played with dolls with them and did other girly things. I remember one point one of the girl's mothers got married, so we got to go to a wedding. I was honestly super jealous that the girls got to wear dresses and I couldn't wear one. When I would be home laying in bed by myself, I often wished there would be a magic pill I could take that would turn me into a woman. I was got obsessed with it to the point I went as far as to stealing my moms clothes to wear them and pretend I'm a woman.

However around when I became a teen things changed a lot. The first thing that happened when I was in about 6th grade, my dad caught me dressed up in my mom's clothes. He was really disappointed and let me know about it. I felt so ashamed after that. So I stopped doing that, I tried to be a guy after that, I don't wanna be a disappoint to my parents. On the surface, I seemed like a normal cis guy, but I still felt the want to be a woman. But when I get to middle school my cast of friends change completely. Two of the three girls moved away, and my relationship with the other one declined to the point where we were hardly friends. So my new cast of friends is basically all male. I seem like a normal cis male on the outside. I must be a guy that was just confused as a kid is all right? Well I now kind of alternate between two clashing ideas.

The first one is that I'm definitely a guy that was confused as a kid, and the only reason I have these thoughts now is because I can't get a girlfriend. I know the girlfriend thing sounds stupid, but I'm honestly obsessed with the idea of getting one. Sometimes I feel like if I could get a girlfriend, it would end all thought of being transgender.

The other idea that goes in my head, is that I'm clearly a woman in a man's body that is just in flat out denial because of societal pressure. I think a lot about ""what if I could magically turn into a woman?"" I oftentimes conclude I would be a lot happier if I could. 
I don't do girly things like I did as a kid, but I own a set of woman's clothes and will wear them in my room by myself where I can't be seen. Don't do it as often as I could, but I do it. I also set most of my online avatars(like in online video games and stuff) to female, and never release the info that my gender is male in real life.

I've understood that I am trans for about a month now.  And, like with many of you, the realization and truth was freeing and uplifting.

However, now I'm seeming to have a little trouble embracing my feminine, erm, ""persona""?  Though it might be better to say that I'm having trouble discarding or distancing myself from my false ""male"" persona.

My previous coping mechanism for dealing with my misunderstood dysphoria was to simply embrace my flaws as my me.  My depression, my self loathing, my over-analytical, neurotic nature, I embraced and protected.  Even as it was damaging me, I held on tighter, under this tragically romantic fallacy that if I internalized it hard enough, I'd, I dunno, work?  Yeah, I know, i was doomed, but i didn't realize yet.

So, now I'm at this weird in-between, stuck in the middle of embracing my female identity, but still ""untangling"" myself from the man I thought I was.  

I mess up on my own pronouns in my head, and I call myself my old name.  And it isn't comforting.  I described it to my wife as, like in a show or movie, how they will sometimes visually represent depression or sadness by showing the colors dim and drain around a person, like a blue-tone filter applied to everything.  That's how it feels when I misgender myself, or think about crawling back inside my old male clothes, and hiding again.  But it's familiar, and usual.

One the other side, when I'm gendered correctly, by myself or others, or when I'm in confirming clothing, or call myself my name, it's bright and vibrant, and happy.  But it's also new, and unfamiliar.

And because of this, part of me wants to rush my transition as much as possible, to force everything into the world regardless of consequence.  However, this would not work yet.  I live in a conservative part of town, and I have a job I cannot, simply cannot, present while attending to.  Also, I'm still working towards getting my body where I want it, and embracing my own features in a feminine sense.  The last thing I want to do is push too hard, get the ""man in a dress"" kind of dysphoria, and scare myself into hiding again.  Depression is horrible and painful, but it is familiar, and familiarity has a weird, fucked up appeal.

So, i'm here.  I'm working on getting more feminine ""masculine"" clothes, such as women's jeans and shoes, more colorful shirts, things that still kinda pass for ""guy"", but let me feel like I'm being the girl I am.  I'm trying to call myself a woman, use my name.  I'm trying to see the girl that is there.  And I see it, sometimes.  I just wish I could get there faster.

Anyways, thanks for reading.  Posting things like this helps.  And feel free to leave similar experiences in the comments (or anything at all in the comments, really.  I'm happy to listen).

But it\'s also new, and unfamiliar.\n\nAnd because of this, part of me wants to rush my transition as much as possible, to force everything into the world regardless of consequence.  However, this would not work yet.  I live in a conservative part of town, and I have a job I cannot, simply cannot, present while attending to.  Also, I\'m still working towards getting my body where I want it, and embracing my own features in a feminine sense.  The last thing I want to do is push too hard, get the ""man in a dress"" kind of dysphoria, and scare myself into hiding again.  Depression is horrible and painful, but it is familiar, and familiarity has a weird, fucked up appeal.\n\nSo, i\'m here.  I\'m working on getting more feminine ""masculine"" clothes, such as women\'s jeans and shoes, more colorful shirts, things that still kinda pass for ""guy"", but let me feel like I\'m being the girl I am.  I\'m trying to call myself a woman, use my name.  I\'m trying to see the girl that is there.  And I see it, sometimes.  I just wish I could get there faster.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading.  Posting things like this helps.  And feel free to leave similar experiences in the comments (or anything at all in the comments, really.  I\'m happy to listen).\n\nHugs and such.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Troubles embracing female identity.', 'created': 1512330085.0}"

Pre HRT, but bloods reveal my natural hormone balance is actually more female normal than male normal (woohoo!)

  I often use the labels ""demigirl"" or more generally ""transfeminine"", because I dont always feel able to call myself simply a girl. ""Girl"" sounds right sometimes, but ""trans girl"" doesnt. Its a weird combination of labels that seems to work for me...

I have strong dysphoria about being male, and one thing that triggers it is when I actually FEEL male. I often have to make an effort to see myself as female, rather than androgynous (what im wearing and how I look affect this quite a lot). So, being as how ""feeling female"" equals ""feeling human/happy/non-dysphoric"", is it worth trying to ""force it"" a bit more? Or, is that a bit unnatural, and should I wait and let HRT change my self image?

I have been able to see myself as female more often since social transition, but its just not enough, and things (usually libido related) keep dragging me back.

39,2017-12-07 19:43:36,7i92hl,8,22,"Hello ladies, fellers, and enbys! Just wanted to talk about somethin for a little bit. I just made a new account after using my old one with my deadname on it for five years and wanted to make a first post with it.

My name is Dahlia, and I'm a trans woman of 21. I've been officially out for almost two and a half years, and I've only been on HRT for two months. I'm not good at makeup, my executive dysfunction makes it hard to get out of bed and brush my teeth, never mind shaving. I don't usually wear what most people would consider ""feminine"" clothing, being that it's not my personal style and it's getting cold here in Denver, CO.

I'm pretty involved in the underground music scene in Denver; I play in two bands, [Flower Crown Me A Queen](https://flowercrownmeaqueen.bandcamp.com) and [Ludlow](https://ludlowmassacre.bandcamp.com), the latter of which has all trans members. I'm generally well known here as far as underground shows go, which are populated by folks like me: Gender-nonconforming, a rejection of the binary, disdain for authority and rules, and a presentation to match. I've got a beard, I dress in alternative fashion and I don't act explicitly feminine, because that's not who I am. I'm a firey, runaway cart that doesn't care if there are roadblocks in my path. I'm getting to where I'm trying to go.

I'm just having trouble reconciling these spaces where I am welcomed and appreciated and respected, not in spite of my being transgender, but very much because of it, and how I still get misgendered at work by customers, and by strangers on the street and in my neighborhood. I know that it's because of my unwillingness to pass, partly because I know I can't yet (so why bother?) and also because I shouldn't need to pass in order to be respected. I shouldn't need to bend over backwards for people who couldn't give less of a fuck if I fit into the boxes they try to stuff me into. They won't be satisfied until they can't tell the difference between a trans person and a cis person, and even then there's still laws being made about us and a murder rate that's phenomenally fucked up.

I don't wanna hide. [I don't want to have to force myself back into the closet if I can help it](https://sheherhers.bandcamp.com), and I want to make a world where people don't have to do that in order to be respected. I just want to be treated like a person, no strings attached, no fine print.

It was a lot easier when I was younger and there were less immediate consequences. Being a transgender adult in the US right now is a lot fucking harder than it should be, and I'm just mad about it. I needed to talk about it. It should be addressed and I don't know what avenues people would be willing to listen to. I'm frustrated, and tired.

I was surprisingly annoyed as a cis woman by this particular person's choice to be ""trans."" Okay, so as a trans person, you get to wear women's clothes when it suits you, but grow a beard and wear men's clothes when it will benefit your career? You don't buy me a drink when we go out on our first date, but you get to suggest sex repeatedly throughout the night (when I say I just want to take things slow and connect emotionally), basically, just be an entitled man to the NTH degree. Bragging about your blossoming business and all the connections you have through your family and 'mentors.' I can't take it. I'm like, okay, so you just want to be a trans person because you want to escape the societal expectations of being a 'man,' but still maintain the perks? Fuck that. The expectations we place on men are there for a reason. Namely, white, socioeconomically privileged men are given HUGE advantages in this society. Being a man means you have more to give, period. And yet, they take, and take and take and take. And don't know any better. How can you be so ignorant? As a cis woman, I face glass ceiling after glass ceiling in my career. The men who would 'mentor,' me tend to just hit on me, and when I reject them, refuse to promote me. The women I work for are struggling themselves, and are usually supported by a man to help them make ends meet financially. 

Not to mention, they got off, and then left immediately. 
""Do you want to get off?"" 

Ohh, no. I'm just the girl who's been accepting a man in silk underwear and a bra in her bed for the first time with an open and supportive mind. Definitely don't even try to grab my boobs or get me off in any way (me entirely clothed, them, mostly naked). I even felt some mild shaming from them about my body hair - total double standard.

Basically, in sum, I'm like, okayyy dude, so you're going to be the entitled overly confident mediocre white man AND wear my underwear, bra and clothes? You really don't know where to stop. 

This person even admitted they decided to become trans after their gf was angry with them for not fulfilling her expectations of being a man (read maybe just respectful partner?!?). 

p.s I expect a ton of backlash here... this isn't easy to articulate. I have some very close trans friends, and I empathize greatly with them. This particular individual though... wth. 

EDIT: Just found this, which seems to go along with my ideas at the moment:

""In a society where men hold power, the most powerful thing a woman can do is to have influence over men. The idea of a member of an oppressed class influencing the powerful is fundamentally threatening to the existing order of society, because it puts some degree of power into the hands of those oppressed people. 

Initially, Siren mythos reflected an existing fear of the female potential to tempt and ruin powerful men. But over the course of centuries, their story grew into a tool to reinforce that fear. Sirens grow from a few sisters stranded on an island by a curse, to a working class of Sicilian prostitutes, to all women. When Lapide wrote that ‘voice and sight alike deal destruction and death’, he was speaking into a fear that stretches all the way back to Eden narratives—a fear that listening to a woman is a mortal error.""",trans,I realize this person doesn't represent the whole trans community...

So he hasn’t been able to take his shot in 2 weeks going onto 3 weeks and he’s starting to get a lot of mood swings. It all happened when he went to refill at Walgreens and they told him he was able to pick up his new prescription the next day, so he went and tried and they didn’t have it and told him to call his doctor to call it in. He called his endocrinologist to refill it and send it to Walgreens but the receptionist wouldn’t let him refill unless he scheduled an appointment which wasn’t going to be until 6 months from now. He made the appointment to get the prescription and they told him they were going to call it into Walgreens the next day. So a few days go by and they didn’t call Walgreens to refill it.

I'm now 17 years old and have lived my whole life as a boy. kinda. I always was more of a girl than a boy. When inwas a child i always had long hair and liked girly things. Well, when i started hitting puberty i felt kinda forced to stop that and be a normal boy, i started to be someone who i really didnt want to be, just so i could fit in. i lost all of my self esteem in the process, started to hate myself, and i just wanst happy over the last two years. Well, now that started to change. Since the last 2 months or so there have been some big changes to myself, started wearing feminine clothes, dyed my hair blue and started wearing makeup. And i love it, it makes me look so much better! Also i've now accepted that i'm pansexual. Well, the thing is, that's not enough. I feel weird in my body, i don't feel like i'm a boy. My parents told me one thing that helped me to understand this: that i wasn't born entirely male. i was born without balls. I had a surgery at the age of one so i could have them, and be a normal boy. it worked, biologically i'm a boy now. But, while my parents could make my body a boy, my brain isn't.

If i could just push a button and wakeup as girl tomorrow, i'd do it. And i would be so so happy.
But, well, thats where my problems start. 

I'm extremely afraid of transitioning. I dont know if i could do it. I'm so afraid that i couldn't pass as a girl, even though i have a very feminine [figure/face](http://imgur.com/8kQdpRR) because my puberty stuffed me full of female hormones. I'm just afraid that people would know that i'm not a real girl. Also my voice is way too deep..  is a deep voice something you can change at all? The thing i'm most afraid of is, that i would loose all of the people i hold dear. I dont know what they would say. I'm afraid that they would see me as a freak. I dont wanna be that.. i dont wanna be a boy in a dress, i wanna be a girl, the one thing i was always meant to be. I know my parents would support me because they know about how i was born. but everyone else..? i get made fun of just for wearing makeup. I feel that, if i'm going to be a girl, then i'd have to start a new life as a girl. Somewhere where no one knows im not really a girl. And i dont know if i could ever do that.

I don't know if i'm fully 100% just a girl tho, like, if i could i would want to swap genders like i want to. I'd like to be a girl mostly but also be able to be a boy sometimes.So maybe i'm bigender? But i guess just fluently changing my gender... will not be a possibility..? i dont know.. being able to do that it would kinda be my dream. i'd be so happy, but i dont know if people could ever accept that

The other thing is i dont know if anyone could love me like that... if i ever could find a boyfriend like that, every straight guy would stop talking to me as soon as he finds out that i'm not a real girl, and gay guys... do they even like super feminine guys that wanna be mostly a girl?

Well, thats it all for now... every help i can get from you guys would be so so so appreciated &lt;3 just tell my your opinion please!

I went through life without questioning gender much... Or rather, efficiently gagging every gender question I ever had to the point of never being aware of my discomfort with my assigned gender. 

At age 34 I realise I'm not entirely happy with the gender I was assigned and I start looking into it. Books, YouTube, forums, talking to people, you know the drill...

At age 35 I realise I'm a woman, but I don't quite ""fit the bill""... That horrible transnormative idea that there is a right way to be a trans woman.

I've met a number of guys in the past myself and after hearing about dating stories through others, I came to the conclusion that while many attractive and confident guys date t-girls, and some of them fetishize t-girls...I feel like some straight men seem to date t-girls, not by choice, but out of choice, if that makes sense?

I'm talking about guys who aren't that confident, not really attractive (not ugly though), yet who are into glamorous girls and they stand a zero chance being with glamorous genetic women.

And they don't particularly have a 'thing' for us, yet they go find t-girls on purpose because they think they have found their niche, and know that trans people are still not entirely accepted in society and if they put up with labels, they know they can be with someone hotter, or someone even out of their league.

About me: I‘m 17 / from Austria / have made a post called „ i wanna be a girl and i‘m so afraid of it“ which this post is basically a followup of, you dont have to read the other one too though :). Here‘s some pics of my progress till now : [Crossdressing](http://imgur.com/vDrc3IC)     [Me in 24/7 boy mode](http://imgur.com/plwCOf4)      [My legs i‘m a tiny bit proud of](http://imgur.com/og0l0t3)       

So, after much consideration i‘ve decided that i‘m gonna transition to a woman now. I have a pretty much perfect situation to transition. I‘m 17 and my family is on my side, and will help me, also my best friends also sad they think its cool that i‘m doing this and that they‘re surely be helping me. So everything is going great in that regard. I‘ll go to career school for 9 weeks soon (Jan 7) and that‘s the time i‘m starting my transition. I‘m in school with my 2 best friends. 

So yeah... the thing is, i dont really know where and how to start :(. 

What i‘m doing already: Basic Makeup, Mascara, wearing unisex clothes, crossdressing in private ( i only got 1 dress that doesnt really fit me though). I‘m basically looking like a femboy rn.

I dont know where i should start improving, what i should start doing to look like a girl. I really need help finding out what my next big steps should be, and i hope some of you could help me!
I‘ve included some pics of me. 

I think my face is quite the biggest problem, and i dont know what i should do next to make it look more like a girls. I‘m pretty happy about my figure already but i could surely use some tips to make myself look less flat! 

Also, i really wanna grow my hair out, i want long hair well past my shoulders. I thought that i could accomplish that with extensions? Is my hair long enough to wear extensions, would they work on me or what should i do..? Does anyone have some experience with them? 

I do wanna start with HRT, my parents are okay with it but i‘m a bit confused about the whole process in austria. I dont know where to go really, do i just go to my doctor and tell them about it? I do need some doctors approval to do HRT so i guess i need to visit a psychiatrist...? Also, do you think that HRT would change much about my body? Would it really help me?

104,2017-12-19 00:12:09,7kpeme,12,14,"I notice the straps to my camisole have fallen off of my shoulders again, and are both sitting on the top of my upper arms, hidden by the pink t-shirt I'm wearing.  I hesitate before fixing this; it occurs to me that this is a thing women do.  This is a thing I do.  The presence of the camisole under my shirt comforts me, a reminder that, though the world presently sees me one way, I am something different.  I lightly smile from the validation as I think...

It's two months ago, give or take some days.  I've just slipped into my wife's Little Mermaid union suit, more than half as a joke.  I'd told a friend earlier that, since I had lost some weight, I'd be willing to try ""cross dressing"" again for kicks.  I used to do it some when I was younger, but I'd since gained weight, and didn't feel I could ""pull off the look"".  My wife had felt a little left out, so hopping into the jumper seemed a good way to make her grin.

My wife, she saw something, though, something I wasn't ready to acknowledge just yet.  She smiled, encouraged me to try on a camisole of hers.  It was light green, and a little too big, but it was nice, comforting.  I felt better than I had in a while.

But it was just a camisole.  Why would a shirt make me feel better?

Flash back years ago.  It's about two decades past, actually, if I'm being honest.  I'm a teenager, and I'm at home by myself.  I can't remember where my younger brother was, but the important thing is he wasn't there.  I'm in my mother's bedroom, and I'm wearing a skirt of hers, as well as a blouse.  I have on a bra stuffed with socks.  I look in the mirror, and my heart is racing.  I'm confused, and excited, and honestly a little aroused.  I didn't understand euphoria, or elation.  I'd never heard the word ""trans"", and transvestites were those gay men who were always killed in movies.  

I thought it was a kink.  I thought the clothes just turned me on.

Now a few years later, I'm eighteen.  I have understanding friends who I spend a lot of time with.  They are older.  They have their own house.  They are the first poly triad I have ever known.  They are caring and accepting.

With their help, I experimented with ""cross dressing"".  I learned to apply basic makeup.  I bought my first panties.  I was happy when I wore these things.  I was a boy wearing women's clothes, and I was happy when I did.

I talked to one of my friends there, stating I wanted to dress like that all the time.  I asked them if they knew anywhere what would allow that.

It was the early two thousands.  They were honest.  They told me that, sometimes men would dress in ""more effiminate"" clothes, in nice pretty shirts and form fitting slacks.

I didn't want that.  I sat there in a lavender tank top and jean shorts with a pretty embroidered flower on the seat, and I began repressing.

Forward now, to just around this time last month.  I've been exploring, talking with my trans friends, talking with my wife.  The moment I realized I wasn't a cis male, that I was ANYTHING else, it was like a sickness had been cured.  So much of my self loathing, my depression, my pain, gone in practically an instant. The concept of internalized dysphoria became evident to me later, explaining so very many things.  I briefly entertained the thought of being genderqueer, but the comfort that I felt from my cotton panties, my new bralette, my camisole...

Understand, before I came out to myself, I didn't realize I was experiencing dysphoria.  I just thought I had a serious self-loathing problem, and was fairly depressed.  I wasn't suicidal, I didn't self harm physically, and I functioned.  I mean, I said some REALLY eggy shit (""I'd obviously prefer to be a woman, men suck, but I am this, and I gotta deal with it""), but I still got by.

Once I realized I wasn't cis, nearly all of that lifted.  After some research, I came to realize this was an internalized dysphoria, manifesting as self loathing.  It felt heavy, and syrupy.  It felt like my everything was weighed down.  It was a limiter on being happy.

Since then, I've experienced two other distinctly different kinds of dysphoria.

The first is, what I understand to be, a fairly traditional dysphoria.  It's realizing that I differ physically from what I understand myself to be emotionally.  This is usually brought on through trans music, writings, or something I make myself, like a poem or an entry on here.  It's the crying, the mild to moderate panic, the anger.  Most of us are familiar with this.

Then, there is what I've started referring to as ""itchy"" dysphoria.  I get this when I have to present male, like at work, or when I do something like going to long since my last Nair session.

Itchy dysphoria feels like wearing a wool jumpsuit with nothing underneath, but emotionally.  It's, like, mildly aggravating, and irritating.  It builds up over time, until I just HAVE to get into some confirming clothes, or get this body hair off, or shave my damned face.  It is frustrating, and bothersome, and well, ""itchy"".

1 - there’s this guy that i like and i feel like he wouldn’t ever love me back the way i do. he’s gay so he probably wouldn’t date/like an enby.

2 - i want a binder for christmas, but i really don’t want my mom seeing it. i’m having it shipped to a friends house so they can give it to me at school. could i just be able to wash my binder in a sink at school?

3 - since i have started being more masculine, i kind of want to go as a new name. currently i’m going as grae, you can probably guess my deadname. people at my school only refer to me as my deadname so are there any tips on how to tell them that i don’t like my deadname?

4 - going off of 3, i want my mom to start using my preferred name, but she only refers to me as a she/her and as my deadname. she knows i’m enby but still ignores it. is there any way i can show her that i want to be referred as my preferred name? (haha that rhymes)

5 - my hair isn’t even cut before my shoulders and i’m not allowed to get a haircut until late July/August. my mom always tells me how beautiful my hair is and i want to tell her that’s not what i am. any way to convince her to get my hair cut before summer?

So, since i found out i wanna be a girl i‘m super super concerned with passing.. i feel like if i couldnt pass i couldnt ever be happy with myself. It’s on my mind 24/7 and i cant stop thinking and worrying about it..

I do already have a very feminine figure, bit when i crossdress and i‘m looking into the mirror i see a boy in a dress, not a girl... The only thing i‘m really happy with is my legs.

So, this is me: pre everything, very slight makeup, no HRT no anything, in a dress. For Fairness i‘ll post a good and a bad pic:

Do you think it would be easy for me to pass or would it be hard? Could i even really pass..? I feel like i could, but i‘m not really sure anymore. I feel way to tall, i hate my long neck ad i really need to do something with my hair. Also this dress (my only one) doesnt fit me at all. 

How long would it take for me to 100% pass as a girl, so that noone would ever think i‘m a boy...? Or would that even be possible? Any tips on what i should do next?

I get on better with girls than boys, or at least feel more comfortable talking to them (does that make sense?

131,2017-12-22 03:58:20,7lexbb,0,11,"Lasted about a good hour to two hours. Thought I'd document it here.

So a little backstory about me. I'm 31 MtF, been on HRT for about three months (started when I was thirty, but honestly its kind of a nebulous area with dates for me). I've got a bunch of old acne scars (from old self-harm days), though those (I know) only take a little makeup once I get the funds together to purchase some. I don't look the most feminine; in fact, to date the only feminine things about me are my hair and waist curvature, which I've thankfully maintained since I was twelve and trying to figure this shit out (yes, it took me eighteen goddamn years). I've also gained a meager amount of titflesh, which is nice. Also, still living with my parents. That's a story for another time.

Anyway, today was kind of a trainwreck. A scheduled laser consultation (to find out if it can even help with my hair color) at 5, housekeeper comes at 12. Dad comes in, suggests we go out and get a bite to eat while HK does her magic dusting thing. We bounce after establishing that I'm broke (first gaffs, corsetry and bras ain't cheap, yo, gotta get them when the dough is floating) and its on his dime.

Hit up a kind of low-tier would-be classy place, relax, eat food, etc. I'm not presenting in any way other than my hair and voice, and I try to be pretty chill about pronouns and junk. It isn't my way to interrupt flow or try to jam a crowbar in a conversation that would otherwise last five seconds then leave us both feeling awkward.

Anyway, its going fine- up until the point dad starts talking about his family; one of my grandmas and how she's doing, his family tree, and specifically how many suicides he's had in his family tree. Wonderful topics (clap clap). Especially considering this is the same grandma that only a few years ago was, around thanksgiving, telling me she was ready to stop living while I was trying to relax away from the crowd with a quiet cig (social anxiety coupled with minor dysphoria and primary-introvert personality. That's me).

I try not to engage and worked to change topic, but it felt weird. Wouldn't it, for you?

Anyway, about a half hour's gone by, so we finish eating and hop back in the car to go home so I can get ready for laser. ...And the conversation picks up where he left off before, this time about people getting older- like how he's 'twenty years from the average male death' (he's fifty-something), and how he wants to keep working until he kicks the bucket, so he's getting his master's (for the record, I'll be working to get an associate's here soon), yadda yadda, but he keeps hammering this one point- that the 'average male lifespan is seventy-five years'. Now he's a nurse- this kind of statistics shit (something I hold with derison) is his bread and butter, but me? I can't help but shut down. Fucking dying inside, for the first time since starting HRT.

Can't get it out of my head how I should have sprung on this when I was twelve, how I effectively never was a teenager because I never got that angsty 16-year-old girl feels, how I never *will*, how by the time I'm actually the chick outside that I am inside I'll be halfway dead, how I've already had a bit of receding hairline (it isn't bad, my long hair covers it, but I gotta wear a hat when its windy), etc. etc. etc.

And I can't help but put my face in my hands just for some feeling of support. Not crying, mind you. I don't cry. But the only emotion in me right then and there is dread. Not sorrow (that feels different to me. I dunno what, specifically, I was dreading), but dread.

Dad looks over, asks me if I'm okay, I ask (politely as I can. I was pretty shaken, it might have sounded crazier than I wanted it to) for a subject change, or that I can get out and walk home, and he says okay, we'll just go straight home instead of through the car wash. And immediately revs the engine, jumping from 0mph at a stop light to somewhere around 40-50, the wheels swerving as they tried to grip. To be fair, it was a semi-empty road. And we were in mom's sportscar, so maybe he just wanted to have fun with it?

Now its no secret I've had a huge amount of anxiety, ever since I had a bit of a mental breakdown at College Attempt 1. This has lessened a lot (read: 80%) since starting estro, but I can still be a little easy to set off at times with paranoia or worries. Right here, right now, I felt myself crawling up the back of the seat. I don't even know if I said anything, that's how messed up I was right then and there. I still feel it a little, sitting down and writing this up.

""What's wrong with you? Maybe you should talk to your therapist about getting something for your anxiety.""

I didn't even know what to say. Right then and there, I wanted to scream, cry, run and strangle him all at the same time. I literally did not know what to do. He tells me later that he feels like he's walking on eggshells when talking to me, which I don't understand. Maybe he wants someone he can talk to about death and shit all the time? idk. Did I overreact? Am I overthinking this? Is this just all one weird coincidence that got strung together in my head to become despair, or was there some point here that I missed?

But yeah. I'm writing this so that, at some point, I can look back on it with maybe a little more knowledge. And so I can write down this next bit.

I do know one thing. One very, very strange and important thing. One thing of such magnitude that I cannot forget or ignore it, because it is a good thing to come out of a shit day. I have discovered my will to live. Before all this, I was in a daze, learning little and knowing less, likely because my head was filled up with questions I was rejecting the answer to, and it was sapping my interest in survival. I don't think I even registered what it left behind as suicidal thoughts- just emptiness.

But if, in a vehicle I can't control, I suddenly claw my way up the back of the seat out of fear for the way its driving? I know I don't want to die anymore, if I ever did. I feel a need to live, now, if ever. All signs point to this being the right course, even if I started late.

Thought I\'d document it here.\n\nSo a little backstory about me. I\'m 31 MtF, been on HRT for about three months (started when I was thirty, but honestly its kind of a nebulous area with dates for me). I\'ve got a bunch of old acne scars (from old self-harm days), though those (I know) only take a little makeup once I get the funds together to purchase some. I don\'t look the most feminine; in fact, to date the only feminine things about me are my hair and waist curvature, which I\'ve thankfully maintained since I was twelve and trying to figure this shit out (yes, it took me eighteen goddamn years). I\'ve also gained a meager amount of titflesh, which is nice. Also, still living with my parents. That\'s a story for another time.\n\nAnyway, today was kind of a trainwreck. A scheduled laser consultation (to find out if it can even help with my hair color) at 5, housekeeper comes at 12. Dad comes in, suggests we go out and get a bite to eat while HK does her magic dusting thing. We bounce after establishing that I\'m broke (first gaffs, corsetry and bras ain\'t cheap, yo, gotta get them when the dough is floating) and its on his dime.\n\nHit up a kind of low-tier would-be classy place, relax, eat food, etc. I\'m not presenting in any way other than my hair and voice, and I try to be pretty chill about pronouns and junk. It isn\'t my way to interrupt flow or try to jam a crowbar in a conversation that would otherwise last five seconds then leave us both feeling awkward.\n\nAnyway, its going fine- up until the point dad starts talking about his family; one of my grandmas and how she\'s doing, his family tree, and specifically how many suicides he\'s had in his family tree. Wonderful topics (clap clap). Especially considering this is the same grandma that only a few years ago was, around thanksgiving, telling me she was ready to stop living while I was trying to relax away from the crowd with a quiet cig (social anxiety coupled with minor dysphoria and primary-introvert personality.

It all started when I saw a television documentary about transsexuals and for some reason I identified myself. I was intrigued by the situation and decided to research more. That was in January, that is, practically 1 year.
From that moment I began to have old memories of when I was little. I remembered when I prayed to God that when I woke up I would become a boy - and I really believed it would work. I did this for a while. I also remember heaving a time (I was still little) where I imagine myself as a boy. There were times when I would put the little shower in the middle of my leg and pretend that it was a penis - please do not laugh about it.
I was still a little kid, I liked a girl (yes I know, sexual orientation is different from gender identity - I am bisexual with preference in women) but she was moving away from me. My thinking was: if the girls her age (she was 2 years older than me) like feminine things, I'll start using. Obviously, I did not last for long. And then came a phase of everyone wanting to change me - maybe people would already be realizing that it was diferente.
And then I grew up a little. By the time I was 13, I began to realize that I was different from the other girls - I always knew, but I was percebed only when I have 13 years at the time. Then I started to be kidden in a healthy way - I told everyone that I was a boy. Was funny.
And then came the documentary at age 14 and we got to where we are ..
I remember when I was little I had also seen another documentary about transsexuals and had identified myself at the time. I was so distressed and wondered why all that identification. She was completely frightened. That intrigued me so much, that I searched the internet about what transgender people were - I had even asked my mother but she did not know what it was either - it happened that I ended up excluding all this idea from the head and I thought, 'Ah, it should not be anything at all ''. I literally forgot in 3 seconds what it was like to be transsexual.
I'm afraid that all this is just a phase - no matter how much I look at the past at this moment, I realize that this has been with me for a long time.
I try to suppress all this feeling of living the life of another person and accept myself as I am. But always when I do something that my other self would do ( maybe my true self, because I don't know if I'm a transsexual and can not take it anymore), inner peace reigns.

156,2017-12-27 01:25:56,7mbupu,10,11,"This is another post that's as much for me as it is for anyone it might help, but you all haven't been upset about that so far, so...

It's been two months, about, since I realized I was a trans woman.  And I still misgender myself.

And I wanted to know why.  So I did the only thing I could think to do, which was think about it a lot.

What I've realized is, well, kinda weird.

When I thought I was a guy, I was miserable.  I mean, I didn't realize *how* miserable, because really, I'd just become extremely numb.  I mean, I'd have highs and lows, but looking back, everything was very muted.  I was nothing but shades of gray and brown, washed out, with differences only really standing out in comparison to the rest of me.

As I've said in previous posts, once I realized I was not cis, and especially when I understood I was a woman, I could *feel*.  This fog, this weight of what I thought was simple self loathing, it lifted off of me.  I could experience ambition and motivation again.  I could enjoy the moment.  I smiled.

I also cried.  And I can't handle as much stress.  I can't tune out the emotional turbulence like I used to.

And I noticed, when I would misgender myself, it was often in times of stress.  My thoughts of ""what if this is all just a phase"" would come at my worst times.

Understand, if I embrace my femininity during these times, that also makes me feel better.  But instead, I find myself leaning into the old ""you're just a guy"" idea.

I realized that the apathy, that numbness, that constant pain, gave me a perverse, self deprecating strength.  See, I was already hurting so much, more pain wasn't a big deal.  I was already so stressed, more was a marble on the pile.  I had cultivated an almost nihilistic apathy as a coping mechanism, and then used that as a coping mechanism against other stresses.

It was a crutch.  A broken, damaging crutch. And part of me misses it.

I don't miss thinking I was a guy, mind you.  But I miss that ability to just ""handle"" anything.  To put myself in a box, and sort it out later, so I could handle the now.

But that isn't good. It isn't healthy.  I wasn't caring for myself, I was emotionally lobotomizing myself to progress through life.  Yeah, I got pretty good at it, but it was still damaging me.

So, now I'm making a conscious effort to lean into my gender more.  To embrace myself as a woman, and internalize the joy it brings me.  And yes, the stress is harder.  And hardships hurt a little more, and I can weather a lot less.  But I can be happy.  I can like myself.  

I'd forgotten what it's like to like yourself.

So, I guess my point is, if you find yourself doubting your ""transness"", stop and ask why.  Really think about it.  Because you might just be missing what you were used to, even if it was hurting you.

184,2017-12-30 21:39:15,7n49hm,4,22,"After all this time, i'm still questioning my gender identity. I'm currently 19 years old.

The first time i started questioning myself was 5 years ago, when i was 14. I didn't knew anything about being transgender/genderqueer or anything until i was 15. But i felt like there is something wrong with me. Then i found a random video on YouTube about a transgender man who talked about his transitioning. The whole thing just blow my mind and i felt like i finally knew who i'm. I did a lot of research about trans people, different identities, surgeries, hormone therapy and name changing. After all this i felt like o know what i want &amp; i was so happy. So i thought i should came out to my best friend.

However when i /tried to/ came out to her, she said i'm too feminie to ever pass as a guy. This made me really depressed and broken. So for a whole year i give up on this whole gender identity thing. I tried to be more feminine &amp; just be a regular teenager and try to get a boyfriend. However i just got more &amp; more depressed so i give up on that too.

A year later when i was 16, i become really anxious about everything and i realized i can't just let this gender thing go. I tried to become more masculine and cut my hair shorter, wore male clothes and also tried to bind my chest down with the only things i had back in the day, bandages &amp; sport bra's.

I felt so much happier but i still felt like something is wrong. In the same year, i met with a girl who later on become my first partner and girlfriend. She was lesbian so i thought maybe i should be more feminine, for her. Later on, i realized once again i was not happy like that so i just stopped it and tried to be even more masculine than before.

And an another year passed. I was 17 and my parents slowly noticed my changing and they were really mad. Mostly because my mother really disliked the relationship between me and my girlfriend. She thought i try to be more manly for her etc. I remember i once stole an unused underwear from my father who didn't mind it, but when my mother found it she was mad and went crazy on me saying things like ""you'll never have a dick get used to it"".

My girlfriend on the other hand asked me about this 'manly style of mine', and i don't remember how but i came out to her. She cried for weeks, and asked me to never go on hormones and stuff. Hovewer, months later she accepted me and said she will love me no matter what.

An another year passed, i was still unhappy but felt better than before because i felt like i was closer to accepting myself. I was 18 when my parents disowned, and kicked me out. They had enough of me &amp; my girlfriend. So i moved to my gf &amp; her mother.

I felt more free than before actually. I finally got my first real chest binder, i was able to cut my hair more shorter and i could buy my own clothes from the man's section.

So.. Now i'm 19, and another year passed. I got a job, and i live in an apartment with my girlfriend. I was also able to get a packer/STP what actually helps a lot. And for the first time, i actually visited a therapist to finally start my transitioning i've been waiting for.

But after all this time, i still have some doubts. I'm afraid i'm just faking it. I'm afraid i just ""want to be transgender"" so it would be easier for me to understand myself. I'm afraid it's just a phase. My psychologist said, that transitioning might be not the best idea because after that i might still be feeling depressed and empty.

I don't really like feminine things but sometimes i wear makeup &amp; dresses at home just for fun. Maybe it will sound strange but i still don't feel like a woman when i do that. I rather feel like a drag queen maybe..? Also i'm really attracted to guys. I've never been attracted to girls that much. I just say i'm bi/pansexual. But i don't know anymore. So i don't know what's up with me anymore.. When i was smaller i always hang out with boys &amp; i always dreamed about growing up to be a handsome man. I thought it was weird at the time, but i always imagined myself as a man when i grow up. Also there was a time when i asked my mother if she wanted to have a boy or a girl. She said she wanted a boy. And i said, ""well you can be happy because you got one"" and laught. I don't know where did that came from.. And there were other times when my family referred to me as a girl and i said 'but i'm not a girl'. 

I feel like it's weird but still.. What if i'm right?

Hovewer, months later she accepted me and said she will love me no matter what.\n\nAn another year passed, i was still unhappy but felt better than before because i felt like i was closer to accepting myself. I was 18 when my parents disowned, and kicked me out. They had enough of me &amp; my girlfriend. So i moved to my gf &amp; her mother.\n\nI felt more free than before actually. I finally got my first real chest binder, i was able to cut my hair more shorter and i could buy my own clothes from the man\'s section.\n\nSo.. Now i\'m 19, and another year passed. I got a job, and i live in an apartment with my girlfriend. I was also able to get a packer/STP what actually helps a lot. And for the first time, i actually visited a therapist to finally start my transitioning i\'ve been waiting for.\n\nBut after all this time, i still have some doubts. I\'m afraid i\'m just faking it. I\'m afraid i just ""want to be transgender"" so it would be easier for me to understand myself. I\'m afraid it\'s just a phase. My psychologist said, that transitioning might be not the best idea because after that i might still be feeling depressed and empty.\n\nI don\'t really like feminine things but sometimes i wear makeup &amp; dresses at home just for fun. Maybe it will sound strange but i still don\'t feel like a woman when i do that. I rather feel like a drag queen maybe..? Also i\'m really attracted to guys. I\'ve never been attracted to girls that much. I just say i\'m bi/pansexual. But i don\'t know anymore. So i don\'t know what\'s up with me anymore.. When i was smaller i always hang out with boys &amp; i always dreamed about growing up to be a handsome man. I thought it was weird at the time, but i always imagined myself as a man when i grow up. Also there was a time when i asked my mother if she wanted to have a boy or a girl. She said she wanted a boy. And i said, ""well you can be happy because you got one"" and laught. I don\'t know where did that came from.. And there were other times when my family referred to me as a girl and i said \'but i\'m not a girl\'. \n\nI feel like it\'s weird but still.. What if i\'m right? I\'m afraid i will make a really bed decision with this..', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am i transgender?', 'created': 1514695155.0}"

You see, I made the mistake of pretending to be a guy with my ex girlfriend simply because I agreed and thought it would be okay. I used to crossplay (cosplay the opposite gender), and i would be the guy and she would be the girl.

She later coerced me into this identity I initially wanted after she constantly forced me to act more ""boyish"" or ""manly"", which turned me off.

I used to think that I changed my wardrobe just for her and this whole boyish thing was her influence but about five years from breaking up with her (I have a boyfriend), I find myself wanting to wear men's wear still, and liking it when people call me by male pronouns or terms, or liking it when people say I look like a guy. Problem is, I accept my being female, but when I think deeper, I start to question whether or not I really accept it even if I am given the choice to make the switch.

* What is gender therapy for? 
* Without giving me personal details of course, what sorts of things would a person talk to their gender therapist about?
* Is there an end goal for gender therapy?
* Those who have completed it or no longer attend sessions, do you feel like you understand your relationship with your gender better than before gender therapy?
* Do you think (or have you had experience with) gender therapy could help someone whose family isn't understanding? Ex: Help family understand and solve conflicts concerning the person's gender identity. 
* And finally, this one might seem a bit controversial, but do you think that anyone, even cis people, could benefit from talking about gender with a therapist?

In March this year I accepted that I was some flavor of trans, started on an AA, and felt a whole lot better.  I added E two months later, and that improved my head even more. Finally in June I started on antidepressants, and from there life got pretty good.  

Well, except for the sexual side effects of SSRIs. I hadn't had an orgasm in months, and my psych care team hadn't found the magic combination of meds which could control my anxiety, depression and OCD, while still letting me ""finish.""

So the experiment was to taper off my antiandrogens and estrogen, and let testosterone run things again for a while.

That...  Didn't go so well.  I didn't even get fully tapered-off before it was clear this was a bad idea. Apparently even small amounts of testosterone turns me into a short-tempered asshole. And I couldn't take the body smell. Or the oily skin. Or the faster-growing facial hair. Or the returning sexual urges.

Testosterone is not the hormone for me.  Wifey agrees, fortunately. And that's a relief. I'm glad she got another look at what it does to me, and likes me better without it. Hopefully now she can be more receptive to me presenting less masc in the future.

I'm back on my t-blocker now, and just knowing I am is a huge relief, even before my T is knocked down again.

For some people it is the right sex hormone. Not for me.

I'm AMAB and came out something like 2 months ago (only to me, and to my girlfriend) as genderqueer/nonbinary/agender. This was weird, but great. I can finally put some words on what I am, and I am (sometimes) happy with myself.

But.

The problem is I'm not really out, and I can't really express as I want. I still looks like a man, and aside from some sweaters and t-shirts that come from the woman aisle, there is nothing that could tell I'm not cis when you look at me.
I'm not ready (and probably never will) to be out at work and in my small town, and this is why I can't really change the way I look. I have more freedom at home, where I began to express a little more as I want.
This begins to be a problem as I am more and more open on my gender identity when I'm home. When I am outside/at work, it makes me think I'm just a cis-male who is looking for problems he doesn't have. I know expression is really different from gender identity and everything. But still. A lot of people even in the LGBTQ community are saying that genderqueer people are fake, or just liberal bulshit. And in the pro-genderqueer / pro-enby media productions, you always see those cool queer and androgynous looks that makes you think this is the only way you should express your gender as a non binary person.

So, finally, here is my question. Sorry if it sounds dumb:
How can I ""feel"" more androgynous everyday in my gender expression, without being obviously queer to my coworkers and my neighbors?
I already want to upgrade my cool socks collection with a cool tights and stockings collection to wear under my jeans. But aside from that, I can't really see what I could do without being too visible to other people.

Hey... so I can't remember for sure if we talked about this, but I have identified as queer since like... preschool. Didn't have a word for it till teen years of course, and raised conservatively.

I am not so physically dysmorphyic that I need surgery, so I am okay with the status quo.

You were the first queer friend I wanted to share this with. Listening to trans folk on NPR or whatever is so.... familiar. And to be able to make love to my wife and then feel like she accepts that I sometimes need to feel like a girl.... I don't even know how to describe it. Butterflies. Dancing queen.

And to be able to make love to my wife and then feel like she accepts that I sometimes need to feel like a girl.... I don\'t even know how to describe it. Butterflies. Dancing queen. So long I thought maybe I was a femme cis bi boi, but it was never right. Really I feel most comfortable as a lesbian or tryke or whatever. I mean sometimes I still fantasize about being with a guy... but always I feel like a girl. Will probably never transition, but still, I felt sooooooooo good being able to talk to her about it and be accepted.\n\n\nSoooooooo happy. To quote \'Signing Time\' that I have my kids watch, ""I\'m a girl,  I\'m a girl,  and I\'m proud to be me!"" (Even if it is still kind of closet,  sharing it with my wife and a couple close friends and all of you feels soooooooooo good).', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Dancing queen', 'created': 1513004867.0}"

Now, when I was a teenager, it was no big deal. Tylenol and tampons to the rescue. Whatevs. I still think of it as a mildly inconvenient bodily function and in awe of its significance in the epic power to make a human if I choose not to evict the whole system.

In leu of tampons, I went for pads, then cups (11/10 these are the *best*), but when I got an IUD and used a cup, I ended up accidently pulling my IUD out. (0/10 do not recommend) in my infinite idiocy I got another IUD...

But today I wouldn't stand for it! And I made what is probably my most non-binary choice since coming out: I pinned my pad to my panties as necessary, put them on, and then put on a pair of boxer briefs over them. It was such a simple solution that I feel dumb that I didn't think of it months ago. But I feel so much better and my disphoria lifted like a flock of crows threatened with a double barrel shotgun made by Fruit of the Loom*.

77,2017-12-16 13:06:22,7k6wob,12,16,"
Ok so hello everyone this might get a little long so sit back and let me tell you my story. I am a 14 year old who was male at birth. I’m currently in 8th grade- Ever since the summer between 5th and 6th grade I’ve felt traces of gender fluidity. About a year later I had known how I felt about myself-male some days-female others- and sometimes neither. At birth I was given the name Seth but I personally do not think it fits me very well at all. I have recently grown to love the name Vail. I feel feminine about 50% of the time and masculine about 30% the other twenty percent is a mix of both or neither.

I have not come out to anyone but my best friend so far and that is a big part of the small-ish story I’m about to tell you....  

About 1 week ago my family woke up and my father decided we would go to church. While my entire family is very religious I personally don’t share the same views and am an atheist. I was feeling very feminine that day and dreaded putting on the dress clothes my family liked on me. On my way out the door I noticed that my mom was still in her pajamas. I recalled a few other times that she had not come and asked, ”Why don’t you ever come to church with us?” Now, I know I could have worded this better and I knew that as soon as I said it. My mom was not going because she was sick and I had forgotten. She turned around and started to half cry. She told me, “I don’t need this now,” and walked away into the kitchen. 

My dad then slapped me (not super hard) on the back of the head and told me “what were you thinking” my sister was bringing her friend with her to church that day so I was being watched by my sister as well as her friend. During the car ride I was told “do you even care about people’s feelings”, “what do you have against your mother”, and “is this you now? Are you just going to be insensitive?” Now, I felt really bad from hurting my mom’s feelings and the day so far so this made me feel even worse. I felt a level of confusion, guilt, and dread greater than I’ve ever felt before. I had a meetup with my best friend for the first time this year and my dad canceled that. 

After we arrived my dad dropped the girls off so he could park the car and bring me in separate. As we were walking in I stopped for a second to calm my brain. My father then turned around and yelled “Is there something you want to say to me!?” Humiliated and hurt I replied with a quiet “no.” My dad gave a sharp “good” then turned around to go into church. My head was so full of emotions and I couldn’t take them anymore. I bolted in the opposite direction, running down the street as fast as I could. I was in an vastly unfamiliar city far away from the house I had just moved into. As I was running I powered down my phone so I couldn’t be tracked, I needed to be alone.

4 months earlier I had reached a breaking point in stress and at 12 am I had snuck out of my old house (where we were living at the time) and grabbed a scooter from my garage. I had no phone and no food. I just rode the scooter as far as I could. Eventually I was 5 miles away and I didn’t know how late it was so I made my way to my friends house. They drove me home where I had to wake up my asleep mom and tell her what had happened.

This was on my mind as I ran.  

I was being chased by my slower dad and I turned a corner and then slid into a nearby alleyway. I hid behind one of the dumpsters there for 45 ministers. I never checked my phone. Soon a worker began working on a nearby building so I left. I walked for about 20 minuets until I got to a local high school. It was Sunday so I didn’t have to worry about students . I found a bleacher by the baseball field and sat there for a solid hour. At one point I tried to climb the brick wall of the school to jump off the roof.       

Soon I had no idea how long I had been out so I turned my phone on. I immediately got a “find my phone” alert. I turned off my phone then ran some more. I stopped about half a mile away in a nature park. 

I turned on my phone once more, entered my passcode, and turned on airplane mode before my location could get pinged.

I had 27 texts; from my mom, dad, and sister. My sister said she couldn’t live without me and that she needed me. My dad told me he was sorry for everything and he just loved me and didn’t want to loose me. I started to make my way back to the church where I had ran from. Once I got there I called my dad and he told me not to move and that he was on his way.

Once he got there we hugged each other for a solid minute. He told me he was so sorry and will never treat me like that again. I forgave him and told him how sorry I was for running away. I had been gone for 3 hours and my dad called the police to stop looking for me. He asked what we should do next and I decided we should go home. 


Once home I had given my mother a huge hug. She was mad because of how I had made her worry and how much inconvenience it caused. She told me not to run from my problems and to face them head on. 

So that’s why I am here today asking what to do next. I still have not told my family about my gender identity and don’t know how. I’m afraid they will take it as a phase, trying to get attention, or trying to be like other people.  They have had similar responses to other things in the past. 

Me and my dad are ok now and we love each other. The only person who knows my identity is my best friend who happens to be lesbian. 

If you made it this far then thank you so much for listening and being there for me. 

Now that you know my situation can you help me find a way to tell them. I will be seeing a therapist soon and I don’t know if I should come out of the closet when it’s just me and him. 
Please help.

Thanks a million -Vail

While my entire family is very religious I personally don’t share the same views and am an atheist. I was feeling very feminine that day and dreaded putting on the dress clothes my family liked on me. On my way out the door I noticed that my mom was still in her pajamas. I recalled a few other times that she had not come and asked, ”Why don’t you ever come to church with us?” Now, I know I could have worded this better and I knew that as soon as I said it. My mom was not going because she was sick and I had forgotten. She turned around and started to half cry. She told me, “I don’t need this now,” and walked away into the kitchen. \n\nMy dad then slapped me (not super hard) on the back of the head and told me “what were you thinking” my sister was bringing her friend with her to church that day so I was being watched by my sister as well as her friend. During the car ride I was told “do you even care about people’s feelings”, “what do you have against your mother”, and “is this you now? Are you just going to be insensitive?” Now, I felt really bad from hurting my mom’s feelings and the day so far so this made me feel even worse. I felt a level of confusion, guilt, and dread greater than I’ve ever felt before. I had a meetup with my best friend for the first time this year and my dad canceled that. \n\nAfter we arrived my dad dropped the girls off so he could park the car and bring me in separate. As we were walking in I stopped for a second to calm my brain. My father then turned around and yelled “Is there something you want to say to me!?” Humiliated and hurt I replied with a quiet “no.” My dad gave a sharp “good” then turned around to go into church. My head was so full of emotions and I couldn’t take them anymore. I bolted in the opposite direction, running down the street as fast as I could. I was in an vastly unfamiliar city far away from the house I had just moved into. As I was running I powered down my phone so I couldn’t be tracked, I needed to be alone.\n\n4 months earlier I had reached a breaking point in stress and at 12 am I had snuck out of my old house (where we were living at the time) and grabbed a scooter from my garage. I had no phone and no food. I just rode the scooter as far as I could. Eventually I was 5 miles away and I didn’t know how late it was so I made my way to my friends house. They drove me home where I had to wake up my asleep mom and tell her what had happened.\n\nThis was on my mind as I ran.  \n\nI was being chased by my slower dad and I turned a corner and then slid into a nearby alleyway. I hid behind one of the dumpsters there for 45 ministers. I never checked my phone. Soon a worker began working on a nearby building so I left. I walked for about 20 minuets until I got to a local high school. It was Sunday so I didn’t have to worry about students . I found a bleacher by the baseball field and sat there for a solid hour. At one point I tried to climb the brick wall of the school to jump off the roof.       \n\nSoon I had no idea how long I had been out so I turned my phone on. I immediately got a “find my phone” alert. I turned off my phone then ran some more. I stopped about half a mile away in a nature park. \n\nI turned on my phone once more, entered my passcode, and turned on airplane mode before my location could get pinged.\n\nI had 27 texts; from my mom, dad, and sister. My sister said she couldn’t live without me and that she needed me. My dad told me he was sorry for everything and he just loved me and didn’t want to loose me. I started to make my way back to the church where I had ran from. Once I got there I called my dad and he told me not to move and that he was on his way.\n\nOnce he got there we hugged each other for a solid minute. He told me he was so sorry and will never treat me like that again. I forgave him and told him how sorry I was for running away. I had been gone for 3 hours and my dad called the police to stop looking for me. He asked what we should do next and I decided we should go home. \n\n\nOnce home I had given my mother a huge hug. She was mad because of how I had made her worry and how much inconvenience it caused. She told me not to run from my problems and to face them head on. \n\nSo that’s why I am here today asking what to do next. I still have not told my family about my gender identity and don’t know how. I’m afraid they will take it as a phase, trying to get attention, or trying to be like other people.  They have had similar responses to other things in the past. \n\nMe and my dad are ok now and we love each other. The only person who knows my identity is my best friend who happens to be lesbian. \n\nIf you made it this far then thank you so much for listening and being there for me. \n\nNow that you know my situation can you help me find a way to tell them. I will be seeing a therapist soon and I don’t know if I should come out of the closet when it’s just me and him. \nPlease help.\n\nThanks a million -Vail\n\n\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Falling apart.

It's been a long journey of just coming to terms with my sexuality due to the religious brainwashing I was subjected to growing up.  I'm still sort of questioning a lot of things to be honest.  And I realize that it's not something where I can just snap my fingers and have all my questions magically answered but perhaps you'll allow me a venting?  I identify as gay because I feel that it fits me best but it doesn't exactly explain the crushes I've had in the past on a few girls.  I think perhaps I could be like 80-90% gay... Anyways, my preference is for men.  Moving on to my next issue.  I basically feel comfortable as a guy... In a way. Like, I don't experience what I hear other people talking about as dysphoria in regards to my genitals. However, I am exploring my feminine side and I don't really know what it means Despite never being super masculine, I feel comfortable as being a guy.  I do however enjoy presenting as a bit more feminine and I don't actually know what it means for me.   Maybe by me writing down my thoughts, some of you who experience similar things could help explain it to me?  Growing up, I spent lots of time with girls as friends and women of the family.  I spent time with them shopping and such.  I don't know anything about makeup or fashion though.  Lol.  Like I start drawing blanks if someone asks me if something goes with something else.  But when I was a kid I remember getting my ass whipped because I snuck into my older sister's room and painted my nails with her stuff.  I remember being yelled at about how boys don't do that.  Granted, I had pretty fucked up parents but I won't go into that today.  Last summer I got to leave the region for a summer internship and while I was there, I kind of sheepishly asked some of the girls there to let me try on some of their makeup and stuff (eyeliner, eyeshadow) because I was out to everyone there and had always wanted to try it.  Something just clicked with me.  I felt good wearing it.  I loved having makeup on.  Now that I'm out and estranged from my parents, I get to do stuff that I want.  I paint my nails on a regular basis and I even wear lipstick occasionally.  Something about it is very freeing to me.  I don't know if it's because in a way it's me rebelling against the toxic things that I was taught and the hateful people formerly in my life, or if I truly am an effeminate guy and this is me physically expressing what's on the inside.  The irony is that I'm an extremely outdoorsy person and spend lots of time getting dirty out in the woods and stuff.  So you might see me with my nails painted and wearing purple lipstick and at the same time i'm looking through the mud for a snake or a plant I'm searching for, etc.  I'm kind of a walking oxymoron at times.  This weekend a new friend introduced me to Justin Sayre and his order of sodomites channel on youtube and I've been binge watching.  I find him hilarious and seeing this bearded, burly guy wearing jewelry, female clothes and heels kind of opens my mind to the possibilities.  I don't know that I'm wanting to go super femme, but I do want to explore makeup more and like I saw him wearing certain feminine articles of clothing and I was like I want that!  I want to own that and wear it.  It looks nice.  It looks like me.  But I just don't actually know what this all means.  I don't really know how to best explore it.  I don't know what it's going to mean for me socially as I'm in the Deep South where people point and make rude comments if I wear lipstick to the store.  I don't know what it means in terms of WHO and WHAT I am.  I guess I experience toxicity towards feminine gay men enough that I'm scared to go down that road.  I think that's about it.

I might say some stupid things but I am not here to start a fight I just want to genuinely understand somethings. I will admit I used to be skeptical and a bit cynical about this stuff but I genuinely want to understand. So I'll go ahead and ask my questions.

What is gender exactly? From the way some people described it to me, it sounds like its like personality. Basically someone told me its how you express yourself along with a few things I forgot but if that's the case it sounds like your personality which would be the same thing. Please don't take offense I am not trying to downplay anything I am just showing what I think so I can be proven wrong or w/e.

Is there really any limit to gender identities? From how it was also described to be it sounds like there isn't any limit on the amount of  genders and in turn pronouns used for them. One thing that confuses me is that if there are a multitude of gender identities and pronouns it would make it hard for me to get a general image of someone or put a face(sex) to a name or person mentioned in a story. If I met them in person obviously I know what sex the mostly likely are (of course they could identify as the other sex which is fine) like but I can't from writing or someone speaking.

Another question I had is that, some youtuber made a video where they said sex was a social construct due to the billions of combinations of secondary sex characteristics and how genitalia can be born on a chromosome setup its not normally born on. So should we also consider sex a social construct? Also this is a dumb question but, if we do consider it that. How would I say/express I am interested in people who are born with breasts and vaginas pretty much standard xx female genetics without sounding like an asshole?

99,2017-12-22 15:49:25,7li7y5,14,15,"Greetings,

Last time I posted here I was still figuring myself out. After graduating from College (and remembering something someone said to me a while ago) I realized what makes me a genderqueer/fluid person.

Never cared much about dressing as the opposite sex (though I tried it once and liked the feeling of girl clothes, but didn't like my overall appearance while wearing them). Yet, I always knew there was something ""feminine"" about me: I used to have Sailor Moon toys and Shojo mangas (japanese comics for girls) and I usually get disgusted at the way men talk about/to and treat women (although I'm not much better at it myself, for other reasons).

However, more imporantly, by looking back at my life, I finally figured that I've experienced many of the things women have dealt with their entire lives: harrasment, groping and catcalling by men, being demanded to look/behave/think according to the sexual organs between my legs, etc.

Therefore, I feel like in a way I'm both man and woman... and neither at the same time. Sharing experiences from both, but feeling closer to women... always looking up to them for advice, inspiration and role models.

Still, I don't feel like wearing women's clothes.

101,2017-12-23 04:22:36,7lmm6w,6,9,"Hey, I started a mtf hormonal transition in 2015 (I think), but I got so many doubts in my mind that I wasn't sure enough of it, so I interrupted it, in order to avoid making decisions I was unsure of, because I felt like I could regret it in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

Why did I want to make a transition? because I felt identified with an article I read about a trans boy, in this interview he talked about his struggles throughout life and such, then I remembered all those feelings of ""I'm not expressing myself in the way I feel I am, I just merely adopted the way people treat me, and I just kinda merged with this mask, but even though I trained myself pretty good, but It doesn't feel right"" and that sort of stuff, I remembered all the times I would dress with my sister's and mom's clothes in secret and how I wanted to use makeup in a feminine way but they wouldn't let me, etc

&amp;nbsp;

I found a therapy group where we would meet and share thoughts of our problems/achievements, an online community, and the support of my family (that last one wasn't quick but it turned out well)

&amp;nbsp;

When I stopped, I thought I was just agender, because genders itself seemed like a game of customs and outfits and body languages to me, like, with rules and such, rules you don't have to necessarily care about

So that was in theory, and I thought about these things in one way, but in the end I felt different, I felt like I wanted to be a cute girl, with the opportunity of expressing myself in a different way, where I imagine it would fit me better, instead of how I feel now: a robot that learned how to behave like a normal guy 

&amp;nbsp;

but, the doubts remain


Because when I see a girl I find cute, I don't know if I want her to like me by behaving like a guy, having a beautiful close to Bruce Lee-like body I trained and in the end be by her side, or I want to be like her and feel femenine and beautiful and live like that, and I imagine combining the two of those things but it doesn't seem appealing to me


And I don't know why, y'know? I deconstructed the binary genders and sex orientations in my head, so why can't I combine this stuff?

&amp;nbsp;

Like I told you, I analyzed it, and I understand the logic of it in one way, from a non-binary perspective, but I end up feeling with binary judgements


I thought ""hey, maybe I can have a cute femenine face but a fit and trained male body"" but I actually don't want that, even if it makes sense to me.



&amp;nbsp;


plus, I also have the doubt of this being just a fetish I have, it could be, right?
It's like, half of the time I masturbate to straight porn thinking about me being the guy, but the other half of the time I feel like I'm the girl, and sometimes I don't even know so I just feel like I'm the guy and the girl at the same time so I just don't even know what the heck I'm feeling.


&amp;nbsp;

I feel so confused.

109,2017-12-24 10:55:57,7lummn,7,19,"Hello everyone.  Idk if this is the right place to be asking but Im not sure who else if anybody would come close to understanding, alright so here goes 

&amp;nbsp; 

So,I am a very gender fluid individual, this caused me alot of grief in my college years I'm now 23, xy chromosome (born male) For the longest time I tried to live as other expected me to live and basically had a miserable life. Just last year I hit the breaking point in my depression and became suicidal. Once killing myself was on the table as a viable option that had the strange effect of making drastic life changes alot more appealing.

&amp;nbsp;

So instead of killing myself I decided to drop-out of college, move somewhere with affordable rent and start adult-webcam modelling to pay bills. I know some people think of that as a sort of ""bad"" profession but If i had to continue working the job I was at I would have literally killed myself so try to understand.. so fast forward about a year now, I became *very very* popular as a model, I've been able to buy a small house, pursue my interests, I am no longer depressed. I'm very happy with life now. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I first made this change though, my mindset went along the lines of  this ""I hate life so much, so I'm going into sex modelling so I can at least enjoy life for a little while and then ill kill myself when I'm too old to model""  I made this choice thinking I would be able to live for about 10-15 years and I made peace with that. And should things eventually come to that I still think it will be better than going back to the life that I had. 

&amp;nbsp;

However I'm no longer depressed, I want to live and form relationships, if its possible I want to live my full life, And because Ive grown so popular camming I'm beginning to think that I may be able to continue into age 40-50 if I take good care of my body since there is a market for that age group as well, If I save money and start investing in a retirement plan I could maybe even live the whole life that I want. 

&amp;nbsp;

however, there are a few things im worried about. I said I was gender fluid, well the reason I'm popular as a cammer is because I have pretty female attributes, despite never having been on hormones with a little makeup and cute clothes I look attractive enough I suppose. However I know that Testosterone continues to masculinize throughout ones life and im worried that I wont look feminine enough to continue camming this way If I dont do something to feminize or at least prevent the further masculinization of my body. I wouldnt mind living life on the female side of the spectrum since I consider myself neither anyway. However I also need my penis to keep working... 

&amp;nbsp;

So thats my predicament, Am I overblowing the changes my body will undertake as I get older? Do you think it is possible to take some sort of low dose of estrogen or anti-androgens to lightly feminize my body without having it kill my sex-drive and give me ED?. 

If its life or death (which it is in a way) I've also been considering saving for some sort of plastic surgery, I'm lucky enough that I make enough now to afford it if I save up a little bit, Would it be a better idea instead of messing around with hormones to do some feminizing plastic surgery?  for example I could undergo Body-Countouring and Facial feminization surgery and I think that might put me over the edge I need to work long enough to save for retirement. All of this would set me closer to my personal gender expression as well as a bonus.

Idk if this is the right place to be asking but Im not sure who else if anybody would come close to understanding, alright so here goes \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nSo,I am a very gender fluid individual, this caused me alot of grief in my college years I\'m now 23, xy chromosome (born male) For the longest time I tried to live as other expected me to live and basically had a miserable life. Just last year I hit the breaking point in my depression and became suicidal. Once killing myself was on the table as a viable option that had the strange effect of making drastic life changes alot more appealing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo instead of killing myself I decided to drop-out of college, move somewhere with affordable rent and start adult-webcam modelling to pay bills. I know some people think of that as a sort of ""bad"" profession but If i had to continue working the job I was at I would have literally killed myself so try to understand.. so fast forward about a year now, I became *very very* popular as a model, I\'ve been able to buy a small house, pursue my interests, I am no longer depressed. I\'m very happy with life now. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I first made this change though, my mindset went along the lines of  this ""I hate life so much, so I\'m going into sex modelling so I can at least enjoy life for a little while and then ill kill myself when I\'m too old to model""  I made this choice thinking I would be able to live for about 10-15 years and I made peace with that. And should things eventually come to that I still think it will be better than going back to the life that I had. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever I\'m no longer depressed, I want to live and form relationships, if its possible I want to live my full life, And because Ive grown so popular camming I\'m beginning to think that I may be able to continue into age 40-50 if I take good care of my body since there is a market for that age group as well, If I save money and start investing in a retirement plan I could maybe even live the whole life that I want. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhowever, there are a few things im worried about.

I totally forgot that I'd made this thread, didn't really think about gender again for a while, and then a year later I basically had a mental breakdown and figured out that I was transgender. I never actually came to terms with puberty or with looking like a girl, and I was repressing my gender dysphoria and body image issues so badly that I was dissociating.

I now would describe myself as a pan non-binary trans guy, and I'm out to all of my friends and family (most of whom were supportive). I've been on testosterone for just over a year, and for nearly as long I've been in a romantic relationship with another non-binary person.

My current partner is a trans man (who has been on T for four years, and is consistently read as male). He doesn't have bottom dysphoria, though he does feel vulnerable when I use a dildo to penetrate him.

For various reasons, I had shut down when it came to communicating my sexual wants or desires. With my current partner, I'm opening up, both about gender and sexuality.

It went well, of course. He said that he'd be okay with me acting those fantasies out - which blows my mind because of his own vulnerabilities. He also said yesterday that he wanted me inside him (I'm away visiting family) which kind of blew my mind. I've never had anyone say that to me before.

I used to have *really* bad gender dysphoria that plagued me almost constantly. In spite of this, I didn't want to medically transition, so I felt pretty hopeless in regard to options for minimizing my dysphoria. Over a year and a half ago, I had to make a pap smear appointment (I'm AFAB) and I was really anxious about it for obvious reasons, so since I like smoking weed, I thought taking a CBD pill would at least temporarily alleviate the dysphoria during the appointment. I decided to test my idea by taking a CBD pill a week or so before my appointment, and *miraculously*, my gender dysphoria was *cured*.

I shit you not, after the effects of the pill fully kicked in, my dysphoria was *gone*. It completely stayed that way until my identity changed to one that is so unique in that it is different from my four other genders, and I guess the gender dysphoria stayed with that particular one? So I took a CBD pill again to try to cure the dysphoria like I did the first time, and it took a few tries, but I was able to cure it partially. By ""partially"", I mean I felt like I was attached to my body (as opposed to detached, like gender dysphoria makes one feel), but my chest made me feel uncomfortable. My gender dysphoria stayed this way for about a year and a half until I got a short haircut earlier this month, which made me feel even *more* dysphoric about my chest and presenting femininely, although I still didn't feel psychologically detached from my chest or anything. I could tell that this mental gender discomfort was getting more intense, tho. One night 10 days ago I decided to smoke again because I felt like it, not expecting anything surprising to happen, and after the effects of the weed fully kicked in, the gender dysphoria that remained after the second time I took CBD pills was, once again, *completely* gone, and it's stayed that way ever since.

**TL/DR:** I learned through personal experience that medical marijuana can *cure* gender dysphoria, and I don't want this to be something to keep to myself.

I've ID'd as FtM for years at this point, and I've been taking T for almost a year and a half. On the whole, I'm very happy with the changes T has brought, and although there are some things that I wasn't dysphoric about before that changed, I consider it an acceptable trade-off for the changes I *did* want. So no matter what, I have zero intention of stopping that.

Since I've started becoming more comfortable in my body and mentally smoothed out, I've been able to start reflecting on myself and who I am on a deeper level. I feel like working on my dysphoria is now less frantic damage control and trying to stop the bleeding, and instead more careful suturing and long-term planning. As I've been thinking lately, I'm starting to debate whether or not I'm some level of NB. Physically, there were some more feminine aspects of myself I didn't totally hate (Like my hips), and I feel like I'd be happiest in a very androgynous-to-masculine type look in terms of my body and face. And mentally, at times the idea of being a ""man"" makes me a little unhappy. It's better than being a woman, but not optimal.

But here's the thing, I'm not sure if I'm feeling that way because I *actually* feel that way, or because of how men are viewed and talked about in certain circles. And I'm gonna have to preface here that I'm not trying to go on some shitty meninist-style rant here. I'm a staunch feminist.

I've had people tell me that it's just a coping mechanism for trauma, but as a victim of rape myself, that doesn't really do much to make the comments less hurtful.

So basically, I'm worried because I'm not sure if I'm *actually* NB on some level, or if this is just some subconscious attempt to escape being viewed as a man.

Despite the blunt title I'd like to start by saying this is a genuine question and I really hope I don't unfortunately offend anyone. I'm pansexual and lately I've been thinking about wether I'd like to describe myself as genderqueer. I've been reason around the Internet but I've got a question that I don't think has been answered. Why the different genders anyway? The social concept of gender is based roughly off of the ideas of masculinity and femininity, males characterised by a preponderance of the former and females of the latter. The genderqueer community and its allies takes the stance that a binary system is illogical, oppressive and a  misrepresentation of the truth and thus some people identify as genderqueer in general or - fluid, a-, bi-, tri-, pan- etc. However, I dont immediately have a good answer to the question of why the community wants to keep gender identities at all. Rather espousing the idea that masculinity and femininity are outdated and people should just act as they feel comfortable. I understand identification in relation to building a liberation movement for those impacted by social pressures and oppression, but as a goal it seems to be a little peculiar to support a system which does still differentiate ""masculinity"" and ""feminist"".

""A Coming Out Email

Sit down, get comfy, and play some Diana Ross because I’m coming out (again)!

We’ve had a similar talk before and it went well, so I’m hoping this one does too. Sorry this is so out of the blue but I didn’t think there’d be a fantastic time to bring it up anyway. It might be a surprise to you and it might not, I dunno. Anyways, here we go!

I’m nonbinary. 

I dunno if you’ve heard of that before but if you had it was probably on This Morning or GMB and they’re always transphobic and disrespectful so please ignore what they have said and let me explain (there will also be some links to info about trans and nonbinary people and terms I’ve mentioned at the end of this). 

I’m nonbinary. “Nonbinary” is a gender identity the same way “man” or “woman” is, except it falls outside of (or between, for some people) those two binary genders - hence, *non*binary. It also falls under the “transgender” umbrella term. 

I experience dysphoria (there’s a link for an explanation of that at the end) surrounding my pronouns, gendered terms being used for me like daughter, girl, woman etc., as well as dysphoria surrounding my body and not looking as androgynous as I feel that I should. I’ve also had growing discomfort with my name being feminine and might want to change it, so I’d like you to at least have a say in that. These things all make me feel really uncomfortable and while I tried to ignore them for a long time, I couldn’t anymore. 

I’ve already come out to friends and they now use they/them pronouns for me and I want you to do the same. An example would be “They’re going to tech”, and “They left their coat in the car”. Please also avoid saying stuff like “This is my daughter” and instead use “child” or something. Like I said, I’m not a woman or a man so I’d much rather use neutral terms. It’ll take a while to get used to but I would really appreciate the effort. We can talk about names later because this email is already long. 

I already wear a lot of men’s clothes so no need to really say anything else about that except that I’m more comfortable dressing more masculine but you probably know that already like. I am however planning to get a binder (it’s like a tight crop-top-looking thing that flattens your chest. Don’t worry, I’d be getting a good one from a good company so it’ll be perfectly safe) so that I can alleviate some dysphoria. 

So yeah. I’m trans/nonbinary. Sorry this was such a long email, there was just a lot to cover. If you have any more questions or want me to clarify anything please ask. I’d rather you ask me stuff (either in person or via text or whatever) than just assume things that might be wrong.

Because while I socially love being a gentleman just as much as being a lady, I just like the female body more. With the exception of genitals, women just have all the features I find more desirable for myself.

11,2017-12-06 16:27:07,7hz4b4,5,15,"Hey people. I'm new. Just feeling a bit overwhelmed with a variety of different feelings. Needed to post. Feel free to respond. Or not. Whatever makes you feel good.

I am 31-years-old now and AFAB, but had (until relatively recently) been struggling with my gender identity, ever since I was a very small child. I almost always felt like a boy. I wanted to play football -- BEGGED my parents to let me play football. I liked playing in the dirt and went shirtless until my parents told me it was no longer appropriate to go shirtless (not because they were trying to conform me, but because I was blossoming into female form and society doesn't accept women to be shirtless). I just really felt like I was male most of the time. They never really ever asked me how I felt and wanted to be perceived. Mainly because they weren't that aware of gender identity crises; they were and still are very liberal and accepting of all people. I think they just weren't aware that some people are non-binary. They are baby boomers from the Midwest, they just weren't exposed to it as they were growing up, getting married, and starting to have children. 

So, they just let me do life. When I was old enough to start dressing myself there was a bit of a struggle, because they wanted me to look pretty (especially my mom, I am her first-born daughter and she is VERY into fashion). She always let me play boy-like and with more boy-oriented toys, but when it came to dressing, she just wanted a girl to play dress up with. And I hated it. I wanted to wear baggy jeans and t-shirts (and go shirtless outside in the heat of the Midwestern summers). 

I suppose that when I started puberty they expected me to be a lesbian. In fact, they had to have been gearing up for that. But I surprised everyone. I was (and still am) almost exclusively attracted to males. But I still felt boyish most of the time. I should definitely clarify that I certainly did (and still do) at times feel female, but I was unaware of the concept of fluidity, so it was all just very confusing. I wanted to be with males sexually, but otherwise mostly felt like I was male too. But not in a male-homosexual way. I enjoyed having a vagina when feeling sexual or thinking about sex, but otherwise my general identity would mostly feel male, occasionally female. 

Anyway, I lived (romantically and sexually, up to this point with no regrets or expectations of change) a pretty normal life. I became sexually active at seventeen, and was almost exclusively heterosexual (except for one drunken experience in college, which is SO cliche, but it's true, in which I took part in a MFF threesome. And I discovered that I am definitely not interested in sex with females. But I'm glad I tried it. And yes I told my parents about it! And they really didn't mind that I had done it, but didn't like hearing about their daughter's sexual experiences.

I got married a week before my 29th birthday to a wonderful man. I love him more than I thought I could ever love anyone. He is my best friend. And I LOVE being sexual with him. And I feel like a very sexy woman when we are being sexual. I don't ever feel male when we are making love. But most of the other time, with some exception, I feel male. 

A few years ago, I came to the knowledge and understanding of the concept of genderfluidity and it finally felt like I had a home. A way to describe myself and the way I view myself. It was so freeing to know that there was a word for the way I felt, but to also know that there are many others who feel the same way.

So anyway, last night my husband and I sort of stumbled into a conversation about my sexual identity, and I just had to come out to him. I felt like I was hiding this horrible secret from him. I hadn't come out to anyone yet. I had hinted at it to my mom and a close friend before, but I had never really described how it felt or what it was like. I told him that I loved him and that I still wanted to be with him until death separates us, but that at most times I ""felt like a dude."" He said, ""Yeah, I've kinda known for a while. Since before we were married. And I'm not attracted to dudes, but I'm attracted to YOU and I still love you and want to be married to you. And if you were a dude, I think I'd still be with you."" I couldn't believe it. What an amazing man. I shared with him that when I think about my feelings for him (romantically and sexually) I feel female, and that I never felt like a homosexual man with him. He doesn't harbor a phobia of homosexuality, but he's not sexually attracted to the naked male, and so I think this was reassuring to him. He added that when I'm feeling female it would be nice to see me in a pretty dress and makeup, just occasionally, for him. I'm happy to do that for him. I want him to be happy. I love him. 

That being said, one of the more frustrating things is when I do feel female and apply makeup and the like, but then hours later might feel male and all-of-a-sudden I feel like a boy with makeup on. And it doesn't feel right, it feels downright embarrassing. Or vice-versa. I might dress in my men's clothing and hours later be out of the house feeling female but awkwardly frumpy, in men's clothing and an undone face.

I don't think I want to come out to anyone else yet, mainly because I don't mind the way people perceive me currently. Those close to me know I'm boyish and want to be one of the guys, and I'm included. I don't mind the pronouns. They don't feel right when they contradict the way I'm feeling, but since I'm fluid (even from one minute to the next sometimes), I can't expect people to keep up. If I get called ""sir"" at the grocery store it's kind of like a bonus (when I'm feeling male).

I've just been reading this post back to myself and I want to clarify that I indeed feel male most of the time. I'm not ""confused"" or just a tom-boy or anything. I genuinely feel male. But not always. Sometimes I feel female, sometimes I feel an uneven and varying mixture of both, and sometimes I feel neither. And it's something I've been feeling and thinking about for close to 31 years. And yeah, sometimes I wish I had a penis. But not to use sexually. Just because it's what I feel like I should have. 

As of now I'm very sure that I don't want to transition, mainly because the primary times that I need my reproductive organs (when I'm being sexual with my husband), I feel exclusively female. I guess in a perfect world, I could switch my organs back and forth. Ha! Not likelyin my lifetime. But it would be nice. Given that transitioning would for all intents and purposes be permanent, I don't want to be stuck in the opposite position, wanting to have female organs in the most important time (intimacy with my husband).

That all being said, I have a bit of fear that someday my husband might realize that he wants a ""traditional,"" cisgender wife. From what he says, it sounds like I'm pretty safe, but it's just something that's been weighing on my mind this morning, the first day that I've been ""out"" to him. 

Any thoughts from anyone? I'm sorry if I misused any terms or concepts or anything, I'm pretty new to written concepts (I've been feeling this way my whole life mind you, but have only recently started to explore the research and community that I know I'm a part of).

13,2017-12-07 11:16:41,7i5r5a,2,10,"okay so this may drag on as I write this but I feel like getting this off my chest and I guess sharing my story.

so I'm amab , just turned 27, and just disclosed to my gf of 5 years of my ""dark secret"". that is ofc, that I sometimes want to be a girl.

for the record these feelings started around puberty, the occasional crossdressing, which was always arousing but yknow, what isn't at that age ^^.

anyway, the reason for my disclosure to her was simply that I hadn't indulged in these feelings since we moved in together, about a year into our relationship, and quite frankly I felt it was negatively affecting our relationship. I was becoming distant, less affectionate and was having spurts of just being angry for no god damn reason. 

I always thought it was a sexual thing until recently to be honest, but then again that was the only way I ever expressed these feelings, which is what lead me to thinking, ""hey me maybe this isn't a kink, dont ya think you should explore this before you regret it?""
the answer was yes, which brings me back to the start: telling my gf.

shes amazing, not even missing a beat she said ""honey, there's my wardrobe go nuts"".
even then I took it slow, wearing a nightgown, indulged in a bit of a gothic look ;). 
but then came yesterday, wore some suuuuuper comfy leggings, with a t-shirt and a little necklace to accessories and I just let loose, my full feminine persona on display.

this surprised my gf, I think she honestly thought it was just about dressing up, but now she saw, she saw this jollyness to how felt, my mannerisms female (at least I felt they were, I was just being me though lol). and then she said it. "" honey, you are acting like a lesbian"" to which I replied without even a thought ""well that's good cause that's what I am"".
it felt soooo validating. my gf is bi and has had a relationship with a girl in the past. so for HER to tell me, to gift me the title of ""lesbian"", felt so good.

of course then came some tears, not from me though, I was feeling so happy and liberated, but from her.
she told me, she doesn't want me to be a woman.
there was some back and forth and essentially what she meant was she didn't want me to ""physically"" change. so no srs or hrt or anything like that.

I'll admit ATM I'm fine with this, after all me and the little guy get on great, and while I would like some breasts while I'm in girl mode, it's only a problem if I focus on it (and there are always breastforms :) )

so here we are the following day, I should say she actually apologized this morning for her outburst, I just hugged her and told her there was nothing to forgive, after all there wasn't.
she had a lot to process in a short amount of time and I love her for reacting so well and embrassing ALL of me.

anyway I hope this wasn't too long, and hope this little story can help others like some of the posts here helped me.

I was becoming distant, less affectionate and was having spurts of just being angry for no god damn reason. \n\nI always thought it was a sexual thing until recently to be honest, but then again that was the only way I ever expressed these feelings, which is what lead me to thinking, ""hey me maybe this isn\'t a kink, dont ya think you should explore this before you regret it?""\nthe answer was yes, which brings me back to the start: telling my gf.\n\nshes amazing, not even missing a beat she said ""honey, there\'s my wardrobe go nuts"".\neven then I took it slow, wearing a nightgown, indulged in a bit of a gothic look ;). \nbut then came yesterday, wore some suuuuuper comfy leggings, with a t-shirt and a little necklace to accessories and I just let loose, my full feminine persona on display.\n\nthis surprised my gf, I think she honestly thought it was just about dressing up, but now she saw, she saw this jollyness to how felt, my mannerisms female (at least I felt they were, I was just being me though lol). and then she said it. "" honey, you are acting like a lesbian"" to which I replied without even a thought ""well that\'s good cause that\'s what I am"".\nit felt soooo validating. my gf is bi and has had a relationship with a girl in the past. so for HER to tell me, to gift me the title of ""lesbian"", felt so good.\n\nof course then came some tears, not from me though, I was feeling so happy and liberated, but from her.\nshe told me, she doesn\'t want me to be a woman.\nthere was some back and forth and essentially what she meant was she didn\'t want me to ""physically"" change. so no srs or hrt or anything like that.\n\nI\'ll admit ATM I\'m fine with this, after all me and the little guy get on great, and while I would like some breasts while I\'m in girl mode, it\'s only a problem if I focus on it (and there are always breastforms :) )\n\nso here we are the following day, I should say she actually apologized this morning for her outburst, I just hugged her and told her there was nothing to forgive, after all there wasn\'t.\nshe had a lot to process in a short amount of time and I love her for reacting so well and embrassing ALL of me.\n\nanyway I hope this wasn\'t too long, and hope this little story can help others like some of the posts here helped me.\n\nkeep on rocking!', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'My first steps...with my gf!', 'created': 1512670601.0}"

30,2017-12-16 08:03:56,7k5wo0,7,3,"

Ok so hello everyone this might get a little long so sit back and let me tell you my story. I am a 14 year old who was male at birth. I’m currently in 8th grade- Ever since the summer between 5th and 6th grade I’ve felt traces of gender fluidity. About a year later I had known how I felt about myself-male some days-female others- and sometimes neither. At birth I was given the name Seth but I personally do not think it fits me very well at all. I have recently grown to love the name Vail. I feel Feminin about 50% of the time and masculine about 30% the other twenty percent is a mix of both or neither.

I have not come out to anyone but my best friend so far and that is a big part of the small-ish story I’m about to tell you....  

About 1 week ago my family woke up and my father decided we would go to church. While my entire family is very religious I personally don’t share the same views and am an atheist. I was feeling very feminine that day and dreaded putting on the dress cloths my family liked on me. On my way out the door I noticed that my mom was still in her pajamas. I recalled a few other times that she had not come and asked”Why don’t you ever come to church with us?” Now, I know I could have worded this better and I knew that as soon as a said it. My mom was not going because she was sick and I had forgotten. She turned around and started to half cry. She told me “I don’t need this now” and walked away into the kitchen. 

My dad then slapped me(not super hard) on the back of the head and told me “what were you thinking” my sister was bringing her friend with her to church that day so I was being watched by my sister as well as her friend. During the car ride I was told “do you even care about people’s feelings”, “what do you have against your mother”, and “is this you now? Are you just going to be insensitive?” Now, I felt really bad from hurting my moms feelings and the day so far so this made me feel even worse. I felt a level of confusion, guilt, and dread greater then I’ve ever felt before. I had a meetup with my best friend for the first time this year and my dad canceled that. 

After we arrived my dad dropped the girls off so he could park the car and bring me in separate. As we were walking in I stopped for a second to calm my brain. My father then turned around and yelled “Is there something you want to say to me!?” Humiliated and hurt I replied with a quiet “no.” My dad gave a sharp “good” then turned around to go into church. My head was so full of emotions and I couldn’t take them anymore. I bolted in the opposite direction, running down the street as fast as I could. I was in an vastly unfamiliar city far away from the house I had just moved into. As I was running I powered down my phone so I couldn’t be tracked, I needed to be alone.

4 months earlier I had reached a breaking point in stress and at 12 am I had snuck out of my old house (where we were living at the time) and grabbed a scooter from my garage. I had no phone and no food. I just rode the scooter as far as I could. Eventually I was 5 miles away and I didn’t know how late it was so I made my way to my friends house. They drove me home where I had to wake up my asleep mom and tell her what had happened.

This was on my mind as I ran.  

I was being chased by my slower dad and I turned a corner and then slid into a nearby alleyway. I hid behind one of the dumpsters there for 45 ministers. I never checked my phone. Soon a worker began working on a nearby building so I left. I walked for about 20 minuets until I got to a local high school. It was Sunday so I didn’t have to worry about students . I found a bleacher by the baseball field and sat there for a solid hour. At one point I tried to climb the brick wall of the school to jump off the roof.       

Soon I had no idea how long I had been out so I turned my phone on. I immediately got a “find my phone” alert. I turned off my phone then ran some more. I stopped about half a mile away in a nature park. 

I turned on my phone once more, entered my passcode, and turned on airplane mode before my location could get pinged.

I had 27 texts; from my mom, dad, and sister. My sister said she couldn’t live without me and that she needed me. My dad told me he was sorry for everything and he just loved me and didn’t want to loose me. I started to make my way back to the church where I had ran from. Once I got there I called my dad and he told me not to move and that he was on his way.

Once he got there we hugged each other for a solid minute. He told me he was so sorry and will never treat me like that again. I forgave him and told him how sorry I was for running away. I had been gone for 3 hours and my dad called the police to stop looking for me. He asked what we should do next and I decided we should go home. 


Once home I had given my mother a huge hug. She was mad because of how I had made her worry and how much inconvenience it caused. She told me not to run from my problems and to face them head on. 

So that’s why I am here today asking what to do next. I still have not told my family about my gender identity and don’t know how. I’m afraid they will take it as a phase, trying to get attention, or trying to be like other people.  They have had similar responses to other things in the past. 

Me and my dad are ok now and we love each other. The only person who knows my identity is my best friend who happens to be lesbian. 

If you made it this far then thank you so much for listening and being there for me. 

Now that you know my situation can you help me find a way to tell them. I will be seeing a therapist soon and I don’t know if I should come out of the closet when it’s just me and him. 
Please help.

Thanks a million -Vail

I am a 14 year old who was male at birth. I’m currently in 8th grade- Ever since the summer between 5th and 6th grade I’ve felt traces of gender fluidity. About a year later I had known how I felt about myself-male some days-female others- and sometimes neither. At birth I was given the name Seth but I personally do not think it fits me very well at all. I have recently grown to love the name Vail. I feel Feminin about 50% of the time and masculine about 30% the other twenty percent is a mix of both or neither.\n\nI have not come out to anyone but my best friend so far and that is a big part of the small-ish story I’m about to tell you....  \n\nAbout 1 week ago my family woke up and my father decided we would go to church. While my entire family is very religious I personally don’t share the same views and am an atheist. I was feeling very feminine that day and dreaded putting on the dress cloths my family liked on me. On my way out the door I noticed that my mom was still in her pajamas. I recalled a few other times that she had not come and asked”Why don’t you ever come to church with us?” Now, I know I could have worded this better and I knew that as soon as a said it. My mom was not going because she was sick and I had forgotten. She turned around and started to half cry. She told me “I don’t need this now” and walked away into the kitchen. \n\nMy dad then slapped me(not super hard) on the back of the head and told me “what were you thinking” my sister was bringing her friend with her to church that day so I was being watched by my sister as well as her friend. During the car ride I was told “do you even care about people’s feelings”, “what do you have against your mother”, and “is this you now? Are you just going to be insensitive?” Now, I felt really bad from hurting my moms feelings and the day so far so this made me feel even worse. I felt a level of confusion, guilt, and dread greater then I’ve ever felt before. I had a meetup with my best friend for the first time this year and my dad canceled that. \n\nAfter we arrived my dad dropped the girls off so he could park the car and bring me in separate. As we were walking in I stopped for a second to calm my brain. My father then turned around and yelled “Is there something you want to say to me!?” Humiliated and hurt I replied with a quiet “no.” My dad gave a sharp “good” then turned around to go into church. My head was so full of emotions and I couldn’t take them anymore. I bolted in the opposite direction, running down the street as fast as I could. I was in an vastly unfamiliar city far away from the house I had just moved into. As I was running I powered down my phone so I couldn’t be tracked, I needed to be alone.\n\n4 months earlier I had reached a breaking point in stress and at 12 am I had snuck out of my old house (where we were living at the time) and grabbed a scooter from my garage. I had no phone and no food. I just rode the scooter as far as I could. Eventually I was 5 miles away and I didn’t know how late it was so I made my way to my friends house. They drove me home where I had to wake up my asleep mom and tell her what had happened.\n\nThis was on my mind as I ran.  \n\nI was being chased by my slower dad and I turned a corner and then slid into a nearby alleyway. I hid behind one of the dumpsters there for 45 ministers. I never checked my phone. Soon a worker began working on a nearby building so I left. I walked for about 20 minuets until I got to a local high school. It was Sunday so I didn’t have to worry about students . I found a bleacher by the baseball field and sat there for a solid hour. At one point I tried to climb the brick wall of the school to jump off the roof.       \n\nSoon I had no idea how long I had been out so I turned my phone on. I immediately got a “find my phone” alert. I turned off my phone then ran some more. I stopped about half a mile away in a nature park. \n\nI turned on my phone once more, entered my passcode, and turned on airplane mode before my location could get pinged.\n\nI had 27 texts; from my mom, dad, and sister. My sister said she couldn’t live without me and that she needed me. My dad told me he was sorry for everything and he just loved me and didn’t want to loose me. I started to make my way back to the church where I had ran from. Once I got there I called my dad and he told me not to move and that he was on his way.\n\nOnce he got there we hugged each other for a solid minute. He told me he was so sorry and will never treat me like that again. I forgave him and told him how sorry I was for running away.

This is all very new and kinda confusing to me and im not sure I exactly understand yet if I am 100% male and will flip to 100% female, or if its just a percentage of each that fluctuates. I think its the percentage, because I am both scared of and have no intention of doing hormone stuff or surgery, since it would radically change my life too much, and likely drive my relationship apart.

46,2017-12-29 23:56:51,7my2z8,4,3,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster. 

I've been struggling with my gender exploration for legit years, avoiding the hell out of it, writing it off as my lesbian identity doing things like giving me a wide spectrum of fashion choices and desires, a deep deep desire to be better look more butch (I just wanted to look like a boy), and giving me dysphoria/penis envy so I identified as a stone cold butch sexually. 

So after almost three years of watching me struggle, my nb partner in crime begged me to order a binder. I was really secretive about it, talking only to a masc nb person in my life and my best friend of nine years/old sexual partner who had been with me while I worked out that lack of desire to be touched. (Fun note- my nb partner is more masc than I am and their energy brings out my femme side so they are my first relationship where I've ever enjoyed being topped. Gender is weird.)

As soon as I got it my whole life changed, and I stopped experiencing social anxiety, and I dressed as a man for like, two weeks because of all my joy. But over the last couple of months I've found it shifting back and forth, both high femme and butch expressions being fine on different days, and many days where I don't feel strongly pulled to expressing either side. And days where dysphoria is so bad because of how badly I want a male body my partner is telling me how to make a packer out of condoms while I lie on the kitchen floor a MESS. THIS IS SO SO FUN.

So I'm living with two nb peeps and a transwoman (I love my queer house) and I'm trying to get a real understanding of my gender because the questioning is taking up a lot of space in my brain, but they all have pretty ""stagnant"" genders so they're not quite able to answer my questions. Maybe y'all can help?

One problem I'm having is that I've already divested myself from gender roles, so no action or desire really signifies a binary gender to me. I'm aware they mean nothing. But that makes it really hard to work out a sort of transfer identity. How did you all work this out for yourselves? I'm having a hard time telling myself these feelings are really about gender, because my brain keeps trying to make them about gender expression/fashion/etc. How do we discern the difference between gender identity and gender expression?

And if it really is just desiring to 'look' a certain way rather than BE a certain way, can I justify physical transition stuff like top surgery? How can I justify doing something like taking T if I'm going to wear dresses some days or just not fully express my masculinity a whole bunch of other days? 

I know these are mostly questions only I can answer for me, but guidance from my fellow queers would be really, really appreciated. I feel really lost and disappointed and frustrated with my inability to just stay in one way. It feels like cheating, and my masc or femme identities feel like ""just a phase"" as soon as the coin flips. In trying to be kind to myself, but I think I need some new perspectives.
