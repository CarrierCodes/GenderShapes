This next part needs a pretext- my husband is not out yet so he will be referred to as male in my post. 
My husband has come out to me and my brother as trans as well. He’s working very hard to drop weight (and doing a fantastic job!) before he starts HRT and eventually goes through SRS. I’ve been shamed online before for considering him a male but for now, he is, so please don’t go there with me. 

Here’s my part of the story-
I’ve always been agender. I didn’t know until my brother came out that that’s the word for how I feel. I’ve always gone by my assigned pronouns because I thought that’s what everyone was supposed to do. I was raised with the impression that a “sex change” is a thing of comedy, not shameful but mostly the butt of a joke. So I am me with my birth given body, but I don’t have to be. 

Two of the closest people to me in my life are going through very huge transitions and I’m over here wanting to be neutral. I don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to get attention. I don’t want to come off as a sheep following my family herd. My birth given name can be shortened to a gender neutral nick name that a lot of people call me already, so I do not want to change my name. I am still debating on if I want to go by neutral pronouns. I prefer they/them but I have a hard enough time myself with automatically gendering strangers (it’s a habit I’m working diligently to break) and I don’t like holding others to standards I can’t even meet. 

So here I am, trying to find myself. If anyone else is going through a similar journey to mine I’d love to hear about it. 

For what it’s worth, we have a child, may or may not have more, and I’m 28 years old. Better late than never? Haha

tldr: I am non binary, currently going by my assigned pronouns, debating on how I want to present myself moving forward because I’ve lived so long as my assigned gender and I’m okay-enough with it, but would prefer neutral. My biggest hold up currently is not wanting to steal the thunder of my newly out and still not out trans family members.

I was wondering if anyone else has experiences with hormone treatments or hormonal birth control and can speak to its effects on non-binary identity?

It was actually very traumatic for me as I found I wasn't acting like myself and I didn't like the person I had become. I'm wondering if this is a common experience or if others have had different experiences with this.

One thing they came up with was putting an additional line in the official department policy regarding the ""right for students to be referred to by their preferred pronouns.""

Hindsight being 20/20, now I can look back and I realize I've *always* been openly non-binary trans, but I didn't know enough to bother hiding it. Hiding my masc side wasn't an issue, because I didn't realize I was displaying it. I switched back and forth between masc and femme my whole life, including pre-puberty, but not consciously. I would swing wildly from preferring pink polkadot frilly dresses and took ballet and had to have perfect hair, to only wearing boots and jeans with unkempt short hair and played soccer and tried to get my mom to let me try football with the guys.

I began wondering why I didn't have a penis as a young teen and wanting one, somewhere age 12-14, but I had no clue that other females didn't have the same thoughts and feelings. I thought it was like wishing for a unicorn, better to wish for a horse. 

I had sexual fantasies in which I was a guy, getting girls pregnant, and I never said anything because I thought every girl thought this way, and never said anything because, well, who talks about their sexual fantasies?

Remember, this is the 1980s, and no one had ever heard of non-binary trans. I was in the San Francisco area, and even there it wasn't a thing. Trans guys weren't even a thing! It was just trans girls. Period. And this was during the bad old days of Harry Benjamin, when, in order to get HRT, you had to dump your old life (including spouse and family), relocate and live entirely as your target gender. And you couldn't be gay. You had to be straight once your transition was complete. If you weren't binary, if you didn't want to do this, you weren't trans enough to get ANY kind of treatment.

My husband began suggesting I try testosterone as long as 20 years ago. And would bring it up every once in a while when I was being particularly masc.

It wasn't until I stumbled on a wikipedia page for bi-gender that I finally figured it out. It was so clearly ME. After all of those years of not having a clue why I never fit. Why I always felt I wasn't female enough and why I always felt like someone was going to call me out as a ""fake woman."" I knew something was not right, but because I didn't want to give up being a woman in order to be a man, I must not be trans, because the only options I knew of were MtF or FtM.

I really don't know what to do about honorifics.. tbh I kinda don't like any of them. I'm maybe leaning a little bit toward ""Ind."" - looks good to me on paper, except, it doesn't seem like it works very well in speech either.. ""Ind. Jones?"" ""Individual Jones?"" Neither sounds quite right to me...

Iono. Anyone else still struggling with finding pronouns and/or honorifics they like? Even after reading lists of them after lots of Googling?

(As for pronouns, I'm starting to adopt ""they/them"". But I do find it has slight grammatical issues with possible obscurity (""they told them what they had heard from their other friend""), which wouldn't be much of an issue at all with things like xe/xer, except those ones, to me, suffer the different problem of sounding a bit new and tacky.)

I'm at least glad I think I may have sorted out my name at least though now. I've taken the spelling/pronunciation of the first letter of my (male) given name as my new given name, and using my middle name as my last name. Comes out as something I think I'm satisfied with.

44,2017-10-09 05:51:44,7574zq,3,4,"Recently I have done a lot of thinking about the types of dysphoria I have experienced in my life so far as an AFAB gender non binary individual. I'm curious how much of my experience you guys relate to, or if you have stuff to add!

I have personally experienced two completely separate subcategories of gender dysphoria throughout my lifetime. I have not been able to find previously coined words for them, so I am creating my own descriptive terms. Intrinsic physical dysphoria, and extrinsic emotional dysphoria


The first type of dysphoria is something I’ll call intrinsic physical dysphoria. It is the discomfort associated with a person’s physical body not matching their own internal sense of gender. I call it intrinsic because it was completely fuelled by my own internal discomfort with my female body and the knowledge of the future implications of puberty. It started for me when I was around 12 years old, and I had a lot of trouble explaining at the time why I didn’t want to have boobs or why the thought of menstruation basically terrified me. It went much further than being nervous about the changes of puberty; the problem was that my hormones were going to take my body in the opposite direction than I wanted it to go. I wanted more muscle and a more masculine frame! I was able to correct a large portion of this type of dysphoria by strength training and gaining muscle mass.

Dysphoria is a difficult thing to explain to people who have never experienced it. It’s a very generalized feeling of discomfort with yourself, and there are going to be different triggers of it for everyone. We hear so frequently of it in the context of individuals who are transgendered, in that they feel like they were born in the wrong body. Where my experience as a non binary individual is that my body just had a few tweaks necessary in order for me to be happy and content with it. I currently have no residual intrinsic physical dysphoria, other than those few days a year that my (already quite small) breasts feel just a little bit too large. I’ve almost completely been able to take charge of it.


The second type of dysphoria I’ll call extrinsic emotional dysphoria. It is the discomfort associated with being continuously told that you should behave a certain gendered way, but this attitude conflicts with your own internal gender identity. It is very different from the intrinsic physical dysphoria, because this type is caused by the words and expectations of other people. The unfortunate fact is that many people are very uncomfortable with individuals whose apparent sex and gender identities do not match. Imagine the funny looks that a man wearing a dress would get, or a woman with hairy legs. I call it being “gender corrected”; where people try to coach you through life, telling you what you need to change about your gender presentation in order to be perceived as normal. Some of this is well intentioned and some of it isn’t, but the fact is that all of it fuels extrinsic emotional dysphoria. You feel like you only have two options in life. Either you conform to what other people expect and be miserable yourself, or you present your true self to the world and face all the judgement associated with it. I have unquestioningly chosen the second option; but it isn’t an easy road. It is a road filled with emotional turmoil, feeling like a misfit, constantly wondering what others think of you, and then being glad that you can’t read their minds. Because they probably think you’re a weirdo too, just like all the other people seem to.

I’ve always been quite a self-confident person, but I’ve found that over the years it gets harder to retain your self-confidence the more that people act like your gender identity is weird. Unfortunately for us nonbinary individuals, we can’t change our internal feelings to make them match with the expectations of society. We can’t change the fact that our society is a very gender binary one, and as such it tends to be confused by people like us. It’s OK to be confused by other people who are different from you, but what’s not OK is making them feel like outsiders or second class citizens. They are people just like you who deserve respect! 

Being gender non binary is basically a compounded problem. You’ve got your own intrinsic discomfort because your body may not match your own internal sense of gender. Then you’ve got the extrinsic issues related to other people trying to tell you how to express your gender. It isn’t an easy life to live. I love my life so much, but it would be dishonest with myself to not admit the extra challenges that being nonbinary has added to my life.

Hi, I am nonbinary. I was assigned male at birth but I've always identified with feminine identities so identify as trans-femme. I formally came to this realisation over the summer and am struggling to find validity in my everyday life. I go to a fairly progressive Christian college, but there is still little support for LGBTQ+ individuals so I feel unsafe presenting on the more feminine end of the spectrum. My parents have made themselves pretty clear on where they stand in their beliefs about gender, so I haven't told them and I don't know how I ever will. So whenever I interact with my parents on breaks and during the summer I have to pretend to be cishet and it gives me dysphoria to the point of wanting to throw up and I start to cry when I hear their voices on the phone because not being able to be my true self around them is so painful. My girlfriend is very supportive and we've been working together to figure out small things we can do to help diminish my dysphoria, but hiding from my parents is a large road block. I've been trying to subtly incorporate femme elements into my fashion, but I don't have a lot of money and the thrift stores in town are really crappy and I have no idea how to re purpose my masc clothes to help me feel more feminine. I started wearing makeup over the summer but I've gotten a lot of shit for that on campus. I kind of feel alone and hopeless at this point and not being able to be active on regular social media today, on National Coming Out Day, is not helping.

56,2017-10-12 00:45:51,75thus,4,1,"The NPR Hidden Brain podcast's most recent episode, ""Edge of Gender"", focuses on the biology versus socialization debate around gender.  It ends with a segment on Jamie Shupe, a nonbinary person who has been fighting for legal recognition of nonbinary gender (they have won a court case recognizing it).

If you've listened to this podcast, what are your thoughts?

I was bothered by how the host said that Jamie's pronouns were they/them but then never used their pronoun.  Every single reference to Jamie referenced them by name rather than pronoun.  It is very noticeable given it's awkwardness of repeating their name over and over again.  (Also the a notably awkward phrasing that Jamie doesn't want to be ""a he or a she but a they"" that evokes a strange othering, since there is no such thing as ""a"" he/she/they but a man, woman, nonbinary person.)  

My bigger issue is that the podcast ends with some rather transphobic positions that the host says Jamie holds, and since Jamie is the sole nonbinary person represented in the whole podcast, it potentially leaves listeners generalizing these views to all nonbinary people.  In contrast, the podcast represents multiple proponents on the two sides of the biology/socialization debate.  I think I'm going to write to the podcast producers regarding these issues.

I have a small group of friends who know I'm nonbinary and a supportive SO who doesn't feel very binary himself sometimes, and online friends too...but even with those it can be so hard, especially at work. I'm currently a cashier and I'm hoping to become an illustrator in time, but for now all I can do is go by my chosen name, Aeron, and dress leaning a bit masculine(I'm AFAB). It does confuse people sometimes, but my voice always is a dead giveaway. I fall into the habit of pitching it up even higher unintentionally when trying to be friendly to customers, and it sounds all singsong-y too. So people usually end up going, ""hey girl!"" and ""ma'am"" at me and it sucks.

I'm still too scared to tell any of my managers because I don't think any of them would get it. The only person I kinda came out to was my customer service supervisor, who's gay and has friends who are all over the place with gender expression. Unfortunately I didn't have time to really talk to him about it, and he still calls me she. 

I know there's nothing I can do to stop it all. I realized going on T probably won't really be worth it, because sometimes I have anxiety of kids getting super confused at me. It sounds silly, I know. I should be happy people get confused but when kids ask their parents if I'm a boy or a girl, or worse, they ask me, I get scared and I don't know how to answer. I know if I were on T this would be tenfold, and also...I'd probably start to be called a man all the time. There's also a few other reasons I hesitate to start hormones. I guess I'd like to check out other ways, first.

Gahh, I'm sorry, this is so all over the place. I guess it's mostly just venting. I wish there was more I could do. I do look pretty androgynous but my voice just...does this all the time. I probably sound really feminine to people and it makes me so uncomfortable. Today this old guy just walked up to me and was rubbing my shoulder very slowly, and it was creepy. People still see me as female and treat me however they want sometimes.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking. I guess I wanna know what I can do to help this without going on T. At least I have small breasts, so binding isn't always a thing I have to do, but I do have a binder. That's all I've got going so far. Maybe I should consider gaining muscle too, but not sure where to start.

Over the past few weeks ive been sending them information, reenforcing the fact that this isn't a phase and that this *is* important to me. Last I saw my mom I asked her to use they them pronouns for me, and I shit you not, she said ""you ask too much of your old folks"" and continued to use she pronouns the rest of the weekend.

I finally came across an article and video that said what I had been trying to say, but better. I sent it to them, hoping for a positive or even neutral response. Nothing. So I sent an email writing that I wanted them to use they/them pronouns, and talking about it in terms of respect. If they respect me as a person, then they should respect my choice of pronouns. My dad wrote back and said ""sorry super busy will read later."" Still nothing from Mom.

Then I get an email that is definitely not meant for me. It basically says ""wow my daughter is asking too much, I wish she would stop being a selfish bitch that spends her credit card on binders and guy clothes and would actually do something with her life. This is just a phase when will she fucking grow out of already."" Okay it didn't say exactly that (of course not my mom is one passive aggressive bitch), but that's the gist.

I'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this or not but I'm not really sure where else to go and I don't really know anyone in my life who can relate. 

Quick disclaimer and a little background; everyone in my life is super accepting and awesome. I'm a bi female which I realised years ago and everyone knows; I have a gay brother and my parents are more than supportive and honestly the best parents somebody could hope for. I have a lot of gay/bi friends and honestly don't think any of my friends are homophobic or transphobic at all. However if myself or anyone in my story does come across as intolerant it's probably just confusion of the situation and a lack of knowing anyone going through a similar thing so not fully understanding. 

So recently I've been thinking i might be gender fluid. I'm super confused and have loads of questions and just thoughts and I apologise if this is just sort of ranting. 

So some background, I've always sort of been a mixture of tomboy and girly, like I've never really fit in with either. I'm not sporty or into makeup (I know these are stereotypes but it's just sort of a good example?). In high school I went through stages of loving dresses and nothing else and times when I wore nothing but men's clothing. There was definitely a year or two when I did question my gender but realised I do enjoy being a girl so I couldn't be a guy (didn't really think about other options hahah). 

So what got me thinking about it this time was about a month ago (I know it's not that long) my mum asked me about which I would chose if I could come back in another life as a male or female. She said female and I argued male, because as much as I love being a woman I'd love to see the other side of things, plus don't you have those days when you just feel like a male? She just looked at me confused and said no I don't have those days (again not judging just confused). This got me thinking about my gender for the first time in a while and I was like wait do people not have those days when they want to be a boy? I thought everyone had that. 
The next dayI had an event to go to where I needed to wear a dress and it got me all anxious and nervous and so I was messaging a friend just ranting and saying how I don't feel like wearing a dress and why are my boobs here I just want them to go away. She responded confused like what do you mean, your boobs are awesome? I said yeah some days I do really love them but I'm just having one of those times when I don't want them there at all. She was confused and saying how no she'd never felt that. I too was confused, again asking doesn't everyone just have those days and these thoughts?? 
Later that week after I'd been thinking about these things, I was dressed in baggy pants and a T with some friends who were loving how androgynous I look and I was like yeah I feel like a boy it's awesome. Then a friend said half jokingly something like 'why aren't you just non binary' and it was like everything in my life just clicked. Yes actually that does sound kind of right. That would explain a lot. Is that me? 

It explains why I have days feeling like a male when others don't feel that. Or why I feel like my breasts don't belong on my body sometimes; or why when everyone looked at models and felt bad about themselves I loved my androgynous look and didn't care for a typical female body (or one at all?) I always wanted to grow a beard, and Is my penis envy just about being able to pee wherever or is there more to it? 

I then went into full panic mode for about a week. I know nothing about this, what does it mean? Who even am I now?? 
I started reading a bunch of non binary blogs and definitions and just whatever I could find and felt like gender fluid fit me the best. Some days female, some days male, some days in between. Yep that basically sums up my whole life and why one day I hate hate hate dresses and heels and the next I'm like this is so fun I feel so fancy! 

But now I'm just sort of stuck and lost. I'm not sure what I'm meant to do now? What I'm meant to think about to know if this is right or if not why am I having these thoughts?

Everything has suddenly become harder too, a month ago I got up felt like a dress and put it on and it was great; or felt like baggy pants and an oversize shirt and loved the occasional questioning look I got. I'd be out and knew I looked like a boy but it didn't matter. Now I go out and I'm sort of trying to actually pull of being a boy, like I want people to think that and then suddenly I feel weird when people know I'm a girl, or I feel weird because I go to the female bathrooms and I'm trying to be a boy? 
In some ways it's been freeing like I've been wearing a sports bra with this singlet over and makes me so flat chested and I feel amazing, but then at the same time I'm nervous to run into somebody cos I look like a boy, even though it's exactly how I dressed before??  

I know a lot of what I've been saying has been related to clothing and I get that that isn't what defines genderqueer or trans people but it's been when getting dressed that I've felt most these things.  

Ive spoken to a couple friends who were all like yeah you're only just thinking this? (I seriously thought everyone had these thoughts and I never second guessed the actual thoughts!) 

I don't know what I'm meant to do from here either. My friends either are or will be supportive but they can only really listen not offer help. I messaged this friend of a friend who I've meet a couple times who has some genderqueer friends and she said we could all meet as a group but I'm not sure if any are (female at birth? Is that a correct term? I don't wanna be offensive and nothing against males at birth I just want somebody who fully gets everything like chest dysphoria). 
I just feel so clueless and lost. I thought I knew who I was and now I don't know how to dress myself or present myself and my anxiety is going though the roof, like it has not been this bad in two years. 
Im having so many new thoughts and feelings; the other day I was putting a skirt on and I felt like I was a boy who was dressing as a girl but wanted to dress as a girl. That's definitely a new feeling. 

I don't know if I've really asked a question or if any of this is even coherent and I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I guess just general advice or maybe I just needed a place to let this all out. I'm not sure. But any response is appreciated and thanks so much to anyone who read all the way to the end. 
Thanks everyone for support!

105,2017-10-20 12:06:47,77ln7l,9,6,"Hey everyone! So basically, I want to physically transition, but I'm too scared... even in nb people I see transition, I just don't see people whose goals match my goals? It feels like nb people transition to presenting as the opposite binary gender, or so that they look gender ambiguous in a ""no visibly gendered characteristics"" way which is cool for them, but it makes me feel kind of alone.

Is there anyone out there that wants ""mixed"" gendered characteristics? Like, a ""male""-read voice and breasts? Or curves and a beard? Or anything really, that reads as visibly non-cis? If you don't feel comfortable with details, even a ""I'm like that!"" would make me feel less weird, honestly. And if you do have such traits I'd really appreciate stories about how it affects your daily life (like work and going down the shops) and country, if you're comfortable with it. Obviously things change hugely even in the same country/state depending on where you live, but it'd be nice to get some perspective.

I personally live in a pretty progressive area I believe? Australia, major city. There's even an ""X"" gender marker available! =) I probably have no right to be complaining- I'm a (young) legal adult and I live with my family who think trans people are jokes, but would never kick me out (parent knows I'm trans). But I worry about practicalities (mostly work). I'm afab, but have a (regrettably small) amount of beard hair due to the luck of genetics. Before I grew it I hated facial hair but loved it on me because it looked ""male"", and now I love facial hair, lol. I feel like it isn't noticeable *enough* but I've gotten comments from a co-worker ""politely"" telling me about her laser hair removal place, which cheers me up. As for future goals, I am genderfluid and my dysphoria shifts, but I always want a deep voice and ""downstairs"" growth.

Like, a ""male""-read voice and breasts? Or curves and a beard? Or anything really, that reads as visibly non-cis? If you don\'t feel comfortable with details, even a ""I\'m like that!"" would make me feel less weird, honestly.

These past few weeks I've been seriously questioning myself in terms of gender and I'm not sure if what I've been feeling really counts as dysphoria.

Like, when I see myself in a mirror nothing about me really feels 'wrong', I'm just sort of indifferent to it. But at the same time I also sorta wish I could be more feminine. Softer skin, curvier, breasts, etc...

Even then I also enjoy some of my masculine traits and without trying to blow my own horn I think I make somewhat of a good looking guy.

I've never really been particularly masculine anyway and someone recently used a female pronoun when talking to me which made me feel quite nice.

All this being said I don't 'feel' female and I don't want to undergo a transition because I feel like I'd be committing myself to the other extreme when I don't feel like I'd get much of a benefit from it.

Is it wrong that I sorta want to be androgynous with some feminine traits? I feel that even if I'm not male, I can't really come out to my parents (I still can't admit to them that I'm bisexual).

Sorry for the wall of text but I have to ask, does anything that I've written here come of as dysphoria? I'm super confused here, and was wondering if anyone could offer any insight/ advice into exploring myself further, and finding proper answers?

108,2017-10-21 18:26:20,77v2rz,2,15,"Here we go again, another shift. I can't figure out if it's gender shifts for my being bi-gender, or still working out who I am.

I don't know if it makes sense, but I feel like I *am a guy* who wants to be a girl. Even though I am a physical female, raised female, lived female for 47 years, I also feel like I want to be a girl and am not. It feels so natural to switch to testosterone and get bottom surgery, etc. It feels right. But I desperately, desperately want to be a girl, I much prefer to be a girl, and I have this sense I will never be one.

Yesterday I had my first female-fail (4 months, 1 week on T). By my wife. We went out for a family dinner last night in two vehicles, and I arrived first. When my wife arrived, she looked in the window of the restaurant and could only see us from the shoulders up. She said she saw my sons sitting with another guy. She straight up didn't recognize me without my more femme body (huge boobs, femme clothes).

I thought I was fairly settled in my bi-gender identification, letting my inner femme girl and my inner masc guy each have what they need the most to be dysphoria-free.

For the last week or so I've been considering a full transition (not the first time). I want to be a guy, physically, but my femme side is very adamant that I don't want to look like a guy. I want a flat chest. I want full bottom surgery (meta) to be fully a guy inside my pants. 

Yet the other part of me still wants to be all girl. I want to keep my inner lady parts, a sexually functional vagina, I want to keep my boobs (and even get a lift so they're perky and pretty again without assistance from a bra). I want to wear my pretty skirts and tops and my (obsessively assembled) dangly earring collection. But I can't figure out if that side of me really wants these things, or if I just don't want to give up my cis privilege and deal with the social ramifications.

So my female fail had me looking in the mirror, looking for what my wife saw. And I saw it. First, I don't really like what the male me looks like. Partly he looks too much like my bio-father (long story there), and partly he's just not how I see myself as a guy. I'm unconventionally pretty as a girl, but as a guy, ugh.  But he's growing on me, and more and more I see myself heading in that direction.

I'm not androgynous. Not at all. I do not even want to try an androgynous look. I'm really, really binary for a non-binary person. I don't like to mix them in a way to cause people to see me in that way, because I don't see me that way. 

If I could, I'd deep-six my masc side in a heartbeat so I can be all girl, all the time. I mostly identify with my female side, despite identifying with guys more than girls in general. I feel like I'm one of them, but my heroes and role models are female figures, - mostly gender non-conforming female role models.

111,2017-10-22 01:08:22,77xbfd,47,12,"EDIT: I changed the terminology in the post, though I unfortunately could not change the post title.

Hello, everyone. This is my first time on Reddit in several months, mostly because while the site's user base is too diverse to be stereotyped accurately, I kept either getting into fights or witnessing fights regardless of what subreddit I visited. Anyway...

This post isn't about any abuse I've experience or witnessed in my own social life. In fact, that's a major part of the reason I decided to write this post. A trans feminist blogger I admire reblogged a conversation on Tumblr that began with one person's observation that they met more AFAB nonbinary people than AMAB nonbinary people, whereas most of the transfeminine people they knew were full-on trans women. Someone replied with a fairly long response stating, among other things, that most AFAB people who claimed a nonbinary identity were either trans men using an excuse to intrude upon women's spaces or cis women appropriating trans experiences because of their own internalized misogyny. She added that social forces (trans and nonbinary communities, the world as a whole, perhaps both) viewed transmasculine people as ""the best of both worlds"" and transfeminine people, correspondingly, as combining negative ""male"" and negative ""female"" stereotypes. She concluded that because most transmasculine people are aware of this privilege, the ""NB community is almost entirely AFAB."" Then another person—a AFAB NB person, for that matter—reblogged to add that their own people were an ""appallingly badly behaved group.""

Now, I make this post for a couple of reasons. First, I am an AFAB NB person myself (in case you couldn't tell) who has had a conflicting and complex history with their own gender presentation. Second, those experiences contrast sharply with my own. It's true that I have met more openly nonbinary AFAB people than openly nonbinary AMAB people, but I have *never* met any nonbinary person who objectified or belittled trans women, tried to exclude them, or attempted to take advantage of male privilege and trans experiences simultaneously.

Now I pose questions to the AMAB nonbinary people on this subreddit. Do you, in your social lives, experience abusive behavior from AFAB nonbinary people? Do AFAB people dominate among the nonbinary people you know? If the answer to the previous question is yes, then why do you think so? Is it possible to be nonbinary without being transmasculine if you're AFAB or transfeminine if you're AMAB? 

The remaining question, though, is how someone *knows* that someone else is not a nonbinary person but a man pretending not to be a man or a cis woman expressing internalized misogyny. What criteria would anyone have to meet in order to merit a designation as a real nonbinary person as opposed to a self-loathing cis woman? If you think you know the answer, please tell me; I'm dying to know.

Before I picked her, I made sure that she was queer and trans friendly, and from the get-go she's known that I'm nonbinary. So far, everything has been going really well, and I think therapy has been helping a lot. 

At my last appointment, though, she misgendered me for the first time since I've started seeing her.

In my experience with other trans people I know, once I adjust and fully see them for who they are, it would feel more wrong to misgender them than not, making slip ups essentially a non issue.

I was born female. And I have always been comfortable being called she/her and my name. In fact I love my name. Not gonna say it, but it is definitely a female name. 

Well anyway, I have never thought about my gender much until recently. It was my parents who made me think about it. You see, I dress sometimes more on the masculine side or androgynous (which I understand doesn't necessarily mean I'm trans/nb/etc). One day I was wearing this outfit that made me look more like a boy, and my mom questioned me and asked me if I'm transgender or trying to be like a boy. Other things have happened with my dad questioning my gender. At first I just thought ""well I'm comfortable with she/her and my name and my body, so I'm female I guess"". well then I started to think about it. In the past, people have mistaken me for a boy or said I look like a boy. And in a way, I enjoyed it. I don't know how to explain it.

Also, today my friend referred to me as ""he"" (its part of a joke we have I don't feel like explaining it) and it kinda felt normal I guess?

The one thing I was thinking about was, I don't feel dysphoric at all. I love my body the way it is. Sometimes I feel like if I was in a biologically male body, I wouldn't mind. But I always thought that if you weren't cis then you basically had to be dysphoric.

Id also like to add that I'm 14. Maybe just teenage confusion? Dunno, I don't wanna jump to conclusions yet, since I don't feel uncomfortable as me. Just wanted some thoughts I guess? Thanks!!

* Any body can be nonbinary.
* It's okay to wish that you were born into another body - even if you love the body you have.
* In an ideal world, you could assemble and reassemble your body however you wanted whenever you wanted.  But even if you could do that, you wouldn't be more awesome than you already are!
* You're allowed to do what makes you feel comfortable in your body - ""you don’t need to be miserable about something to want to change it."" -- [Changing What You Love: On Considering Hormones While You’re Non-Binary](http://www.bextalkssex.com/changing-love-considering-hormones-youre-non-binary/) 
* Other people may see a woman (at least in my case, because I'm AFAB), but that doesn't prevent you from being the most dapper of dudes.
* Every body and type of body has its own strengths and weaknesses.  You may not enjoy everything your body is and does (I certainly don't) but there are probably a whole lot of things about your body and its function that you enjoy, including things that aren't gendered at all (e.g. I can reach every spot on my back).  Try focusing on those when your body or others' perception of it gets you down.
* You deserve to enjoy your body - it's there just for you!

22,2017-10-06 04:15:52,74lbwh,3,1,"Hey all, I've been having certain revelations and I could use some input from those versed in the Trans ways.

I'm 19/m right now, but ever since I was little I was a pretty quiet kid, even when I was full of energy I was never a loud rambunctious boy. I was never really feminine either though, and i've kept a decent air of androgynous about me personality and behavorially. I've never been afraid to have my nails painted or similar.

I think it started when I began dating my trans boyfriend, he opened me up to his world. I always had this strange feeling in my gut when it was talked about. Nothing bad, but I was always a bit envious. Being as out as he was about it, I strangely felt... envious of what I thought was his bravery, but I'm not so sure if it was specifically that. Even talking about it is making butterflies appear in my stomach. I was strangely quick to use the correct pronouns and always be respectful of when he was feeling particularly dysphoric, but I had never had really met a trans person before then. Whereas I think most cis folk would struggle for a couple of weeks.

Anyways, as the relationship wound up, I occasionally passed tumblr posts about being trans and youtube vids talking about it, and I got that same feeling. I can't even describe it wholy as envy, it feels like so much more.

After seeing some trans timelines of trans girls, I think I feel want. Being feminine seems so nice, I feel like it'd fit me more than my masc/androg self at least, however I don't feel any dysphoria I don't think. I like the idea of keeping my genitals the same, but breasts I am completely fine with as well. 

I feel like I am rambling at this point, and this is probably as in-depth as I can really make it. Do you think I might be trans, or just too appreciative of a feminine form?

I'm not sure if i'd be ready at all to come out as such, even though my fathers been very accepting of my bisexuality and i'm sure would be cool with me being a girl, but I just don't have the backbone like my ex-boyfriend. Even in the face of people who'd call him ""her"" and his dead name, he'd clench his fists and bear it.  Even imagining the slightly disconcerted look of my mostly-approving father and/or coworkers after coming out is enough to make me second-guess it all I think.

The thing is, I seem to see most trans people are very ""I knew I was like this since I was little! I'd put on X clothes and joke around with friends that I was X"" but I never had anything like that. tbh I don't really feel like I have a definitive personality, and maybe I'm attracted to this prospect mostly because it'd make me less of a boring two-dimensional person? I'm sure I'd be fine with remaining a male the rest of my life, but that question will always nag me to the end.

Okay, I need to stop or else this'll be longer than a novel.

I\'d put on X clothes and joke around with friends that I was X"" but I never had anything like that. tbh I don\'t really feel like I have a definitive personality, and maybe I\'m attracted to this prospect mostly because it\'d make me less of a boring two-dimensional person? I\'m sure I\'d be fine with remaining a male the rest of my life, but that question will always nag me to the end.\n\nOkay, I need to stop or else this\'ll be longer than a novel.

I figure im more likely to get a response here.

So first of all im transgender. Im AMAB but have been full time as me for just over a year.
I have been dealing with depression on some level probably since I was 16 or 17. Im 26 now, been on effexor for just over 3 years. Currently on 300mg a day after an attempt at suicide 3 months ago. 

I've been on hormones for around 2.5 years now. As far as I know from my experiences and from friends/ family I pass in all aspects. I do get odd looks sometimes but its impossible to know if thats because of my height (180cm) or if they somehow know im trans just from looking at me, something im terrified is true and other people are telling me otherwise to protect me as its no secret i have very little self confidence or esteem as well as probably being emotionally fraigile. 
For a while now my depression has been really bad. I failed a few classes at the end of last year and ended up taking this year as a gap year. Its hard for me to find any motivation and im constantly feeling tired. While I've been relatively ok during the day over the last few weeks every night i find myself getting fixated on how to kill myself and ever little detail for when i do it. (It's probably when, not if at the moment)
I see my gp, psychologist regularly and are seeing a psychiatrist as well at the moment. 

I just am so over feeling so down all the time and constantly criticising myself and how no what happens i can never just be a normal woman. I cant have kids - ill be infertile by now and dont think i would want to have kids with me as the biological father even if I could - I will never be able to have regular childhood and adolescence as girl, and im basically a failure anyway at this point. Living with mum since suicide attempt and only income is government support. I can't afford to get things that will help at the moment -like more laser- let alone cover basic costs like car service, dentist, new glasses. Even though im living with mum and paying nothing. 
I dont have the energy to get out and go for a walk or try jogging and even if i did i wouldnt feel comfortable to do so as the potential for dysphoria or anxiety being triggered is high. 
I do have good friends but they aren't always available or up for talking about what i need to. No one really asks me any questions about the things im struggling with. 
Yes the therapy ect covers some of it but thats only a small part of the week and leaves a lot of time for me to do something stupid or lock things away inside me to try to deal with things. 

I didn't really know where I was going with this but I feel like venting somewhere different could help.

It was a rocky start getting everyone to use the correct pronouns with me, and it took months. But everyone got on board. 

But a couple of months ago all of my old coworkers, the ones who knew me in boymode, have started ""slipping"". Every single day for the past 2-3 months I hear several of my coworkers mess up.

I talked to my boss about it. He tried rug sweeping it. So I shut down. I've been kinda pissy with everyone at work. I'm dead inside while at work.

Yesterday I went to my AGM about it after one of my managers did it, and then I heard 2 others do it directly after. I told her how I was feeling about it. I flat asked her what I was supposed to think, feel, and believe about it. She confirmed that she would feel that way too. (I love my AGM because she is the best ally)

Tell me some strange fact about the African Botfly who knows! I know I seem to be taking this lightly but it’s plenty serious to me, plenty of people feel isolated and left in the dark for fear of the judgement they’d receive, it’s a scary place out there and it’s a scary place in your mind alone.

There are people out there who love you and will respect you as they do now, you don’t have to reach out but remember that if you do it’ll all be okay in the end, you’re not alone! You don’t have to tell someone in your life either, tell this reddit! We love you! I hope my vagueness towards either end didn’t force you to come out through exposure and I also hope no one else thought they were AJ. Left some hints!

Yesterday, I tried on some concealer to hide the ""shadow mustache"" I had. My heart leapt again, just like when I wore women's boots or a women's shirt. I didn't go anywhere, I just stayed downstairs with my parents and brothers.

Today, I did the same. Admittedly rather poorly this time, I rushed myself since everyone was home this time. I sat upstairs alone, but happy enough, wearing a pair of the dumbest socks I own. (A pair of black knee highs with two right leg bones outlined in white thread)

Usually i take them off before leaving my room, even for a short time. When i bought them i said I would take the lace off, of which i had no intention of doing and never did. This time though, i was just tired of taking them off and putting them back on every time i so much as needed to pee.

So I went downstairs, wearing the socks with the lace. And my mom, who I'm not out to made a joke to my dad. (who I'm also not out to)

I should be used to the off color comments and such, after all we poke fun at each other all the time. But this hit me pretty badly. I spent the rest of the evening constantly thinking back to it.

Eventually we've gotten bored and moved onto another movie. there's a lesbian kiss scene. My parents are laughing, my mom playfully smacking my dad on the leg while he grins. Out of nowhere i say, ""is this supposed to be erotic?""

I don;t know why! I just...said it. then my dad turned to me still grinning. 

""maybe when you're older."" 

I'm 18 goddamnit. If this would've been something i could just leave in my past, I wouldn't be depressed for five goddamn years.

I left the room and went upstairs. Turned the shower on and just collapsed to the shower floor. Dry heaving and crying.

Anyway, I sit there, fill out the paper work, I do my best to hide all the information on it because guys decided to come sit right next to me in my bubble despite plenty of room 5 feet away. Plus I'm paranoid as shit going to a DMV so close to where I know my mother is staying but it's the best DMV I know of, it's actually pretty darn quick (like an hour/hour and a half sitting when it's busy but not packed). 

I get to the lady who has to take the paperwork, check my old ID etc. I hand her my paperwork and [Drivers License](https://i.imgur.com/WAW3cOI.jpg) that expires in 2 days. She takes it, looks at it, then at [me](https://i.imgur.com/XnENFdw.jpg), who clearly has breasts, sounds like any other cis girl 🙄 and tries handing it back saying ""oh, this isn't the right ID, I need YOURS."" CUE INTERNAL PANIC! As calmly as I can, I hold up my hand and say ""no, that is mine. That's... well, it USED to be me."" She stares at me for a second before it clicks. I could see the gears turning, and I'm thinking ""oh man, here comes trouble. I KNEW this was going to happen.""

She immediately apologizes and tells me how wonderful I look, and just WOW ""I never would have known!"" Yeah, I figured, that's why I had every bit of paperwork I could gather ready for this (doctors note explaining X is in fact ME, Drivers License, debit cards, credit cards, SSC, birth certificate, mail, a signed letter from my boss with his number for confirmation), perhaps going a bit overboard on my prep. 😅

She is instantly my best friend, and starts talking to me with this ""oh girl, I am SO relieved that you understand when bullshit is bullshit"" attitude. It was fantastic! She leans in a little and says ""ok, so before I do this, I need to tell you that I have to call someone above me over here, because the camera might not recognize you, in which case I need to let them know that I'm going to override it. OK?"" Girl, thank you for giving me a heads up, I know you gotta do your job and you want to protect my privacy as much as you can. She flags someone down and tells them very very quietly. I hear snatches of ""now I believe that she is this person here, but the computer might not..."" and ""Yes, without a doubt!"" And lady #2 nods and walks away, looking shocked.

Lady #1 And I chat for another few minutes before getting down to business: checking my eyes and the new photo. Keep in mind, I'm not wearing makeup and I'm intensely uncomfortable without it. She even offered to let me put on the makeup I keep in my purse, despite it not being technically allowed for people with that tiny M on their DL 😒 I think about it, but decline because I know my hands are shaking too badly for me to properly put on eyeliner, but it's the thought that counts.

After my picture (where I'm giving my best lesbian smirk. Hey, she was pretty damn cute!) I noticed that lady #2 is whispering to another person a few cubicles over (did I mention I'm paranoid?) And I catch her point at me, and I made eye contact with both of them, causing them to duck down or walk away quickly. Fuck, I'm now llama food at the DMV. I tune back into the conversation with lady #1, trying to pretend like that didn't just happen. She starts saying, again, how great I look and ""OMG it says you gained 35 lbs since the last time you were here. Girl, I can't believe that!"" It's all gone to my hips, thighs, ass, and boobs. Plus a little on my tummy and in my face. She asked if they were, ya know, real? Yep. 100% homegrown, with some hormones thrown in. And I'm already st a 34 C after 1 year, they MIGHT get bigger. Her jaw drops and this look of total boob envy is palpable. We chat for a few more minutes before she hands me my new ID paper and I get up to leave.

Now on my way out I can't help but glance back: I have 4 people staring directly at my ass, one of which was Lady #1 who knows she's been caught. 

I left the DMV feeling pretty good about myself, but dying for a puff of my vape to take the edge off (over an hour of crowded room and bubble invasions plus the necessity of outing myself and being outed made me anxious AF), and I immediately called my wife once I got back to my car. :)",trans,"I had to renew my license today, and I haven't had a legal name or gender maker change yet",1507983488.0,"{'created_utc': 1507958288, 'id': '76aaqd', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'Because money, and time.

Keep in mind, I\'m not wearing makeup and I\'m intensely uncomfortable without it. She even offered to let me put on the makeup I keep in my purse, despite it not being technically allowed for people with that tiny M on their DL 😒 I think about it, but decline because I know my hands are shaking too badly for me to properly put on eyeliner, but it\'s the thought that counts.\n\nAfter my picture (where I\'m giving my best lesbian smirk. Hey, she was pretty damn cute!) I noticed that lady #2 is whispering to another person a few cubicles over (did I mention I\'m paranoid?) And I catch her point at me, and I made eye contact with both of them, causing them to duck down or walk away quickly. Fuck, I\'m now llama food at the DMV. I tune back into the conversation with lady #1, trying to pretend like that didn\'t just happen. She starts saying, again, how great I look and ""OMG it says you gained 35 lbs since the last time you were here. Girl, I can\'t believe that!"" It\'s all gone to my hips, thighs, ass, and boobs. Plus a little on my tummy and in my face. She asked if they were, ya know, real? Yep. 100% homegrown, with some hormones thrown in. And I\'m already st a 34 C after 1 year, they MIGHT get bigger. Her jaw drops and this look of total boob envy is palpable. We chat for a few more minutes before she hands me my new ID paper and I get up to leave.\n\nNow on my way out I can\'t help but glance back: I have 4 people staring directly at my ass, one of which was Lady #1 who knows she\'s been caught. \n\nI left the DMV feeling pretty good about myself, but dying for a puff of my vape to take the edge off (over an hour of crowded room and bubble invasions plus the necessity of outing myself and being outed made me anxious AF), and I immediately called my wife once I got back to my car. :)', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I had to renew my license today, and I haven't had a legal name or gender maker change yet"", 'created': 1507983488.0}"

72,2017-10-15 22:13:47,76m494,4,3,"Hello, I'm going through the motions of figuring out if I am trans. This may more just be a sort of self-therapy and getting stuff out there, but here goes.

So I am a 21 year old person. I was born male. When I was a little kid I liked to dress up in my mums coats and shoes, which she knew about and didn't really make much of. Then when puberty hit I got more interested in wearing my mums bras and knickers, and tights and swimsuits etc. She never once caught me. The arousal was both sexual and ""inside me"" (whatever that meant). I used to wear my mums bras to sleep and be super paranoid she would walk in and see the straps, I once even wore them under my normal clothes but soon took it off. I used to wish so bad that I would wake up and just be a girl- I even used to pray to God (Allah in this case as I was brought up a Muslim).

Throughout secondary school I mainly had guy friend, but I never felt I was one of them if I'm being perfectly honest. I was always interested in what the girls were doing, and was super jealous of the guys that used to hang around them. I was a quite a shy and dorky kid, so I didn't have the guts to go and make friends.

Then I went to a sixth form that was further away from my home and met lots of different people from all over the area. I started becoming friends with more people. I realised I liked being friends with girls as opposed to guys. This may have had something to do with liking a lot of them. Even though I had guy friends, I still was never really close to them. All this while I was jealous of what I see some of the girls wearing, thinking to myself ""That looks so stunning, I wish I had that frame and body and that gender, why couldn't I just be born a girl"". Now my mums not the most religious person, but she's fairly religious and something like this would definitely have been dismissed. Also I didn't want to disappoint her, Im an only child-straight A student. I wanted to make her proud. The cross dressing still happened, but this time I wore a lot of her clothes and tried on her makeup (very badly- might I add). I think I'm such a freak. I have a cross dressing fetish. I am a freak of nature.

Roll around to university and I'm out there on my own independent of my parents. I decide to do a little shopping and buy some Ann Summers lingerie and some other sex toys from love honey etc. Everytime I did this I purged the whole lot, saying I need to be a man and every time I purged I binge bought the whole load of it again. This happened twice in first year of university, three times in second year, twice in third year and its happened twice already in my fourth year. I've obviously spent a lot of money on this. I think I still considered it a fetish. Whilst I was at uni I under dressed in bras and knickers all the time, usually hiding it with loose fitting clothes, and jumpers/ coats.

Now I was diagnosed with depression and bulimia in July 2017. I'm currently on medication for the depression and am getting therapy with both the depression and bulimia. I've not mentioned any of this to my GP/ therapist because I still believed it was a fetish. Before my last purge I went full whack, and bought a wig, nail polish, clothes from online and even went shopping in person to buy women clothes from primark etc. It was then that I discovered when I was wearing the clothes and the wig and the makeup (again applied poorly) I felt happy-happier than I had been for a long time. I was also doing these things and I wasn't getting turned all the time. I just enjoyed the feeling of wearing female clothing.

During this past year as well as the cross dressing I also purchased a breast pump (to try and increase the size of my breasts) and self medication for oestrogen hormones. Used them for a while then binned the whole lot as I didn't want my doctor seeing anything funny from blood tests I was having done linked to the bulimia. I considered before my last purge, maybe i'm transgender. I wasn't sure, I knew I was at least somewhere on the spectrum that was not cis male. I lasted all of 4 weeks before I went ahead and bought some more female clothes, spending a tonne of money on this stuff- again!

I have been seriously considering telling my GP. But I don't know how to/ what will happen. I've imagined coming out to my housemates and mum. But theres so many things my mum does not know about, that I don't want to overwhelm her and I still don't want to disappoint her. Im scared my housemates will reject me and tell me that I'm just a sexual fiend or something. But more and more i'm tucking and wearing knickers and a bra. I bought my first proper pair of female high wasted jeans. I wear on my hips whilst in guy mode but pull them up to my waist when I have a t shirt that will cover up the high waist.
I don't think I've ""let on"" to anyone that Im having gender dysphoria. I just don't know what to do.

102,2017-10-22 13:39:17,7808qd,26,12,"I have no idea what to do anymore. 
I entered this miserable life as a boy.
As a child i was very confused and weird.
My parents even had me go to this child shrink for a year. At some point i realized i identified more as a girl inside. I often would wear my moms clothes when i was alone and dreamed about being female. 
Because i'm mostly into girls i though i could do ok as a guy. Why go through an embarrissing transition only to end up as a trans lesbian? You get made fun of, get insulted and hurt only so that straight girls are not into you anymore and lesbians still see you as not female. That sounds pretty stupid. Also my dad is pretty homo- and transphobic. 
So i tried to be a dude. I even had a girlfriend for some time. I did ok in school. Had some friends. Started work. So far so good. I was not 100% happy but i was doing ok. I thought i could live like that. And it might have worked i think.
Sadly at some point my girlfriend left me. She was cheating on me anyway and i was always forgiving her just to keep her. How stupid i am.
This was roughly 13 years ago. I never found a new girl. Most of my friends have families by now and we lost contact. There's one good friend left that i talk to around once a week but he knows nothing about my female feelings. He also hates gays and makes fun of ""these shemales"" which makes me very sad. 
Whenever i look into the mirror i see this ugly hairy guy that is getting old by now. I'll be 40 next year :(. 
Because of my gender disphoria i am not confident and masculine in my behavior so girls don't fall in love with me. In the past 10 years there were 2 girls that i could trick into believing i was a guy but after a few weeks they lost interest. My personality just doesn't fit my body. I also have an eating disorder. I was skinny, i was fat. I starve and binge eat. For the past few years i got pretty fat again. I'm just so ugly :(. 
There's no way out of this anymore. 
I am doomed to be alone and recently i have been thinking about why i even still participate in this terrible joke of a life. If i wasn't such a coward i would have killed myself already. Maybe some day i'll be strong enough to end this painful journey. 
I just can't stand it anymore.

Thanks for listening.
/bye

103,2017-10-22 15:59:44,7810bp,5,11,"Hey friends, you've got another questioning kid. My gender questioning has taken a hardcore uptick in the last month because I got a binder for myself- after three years of debate with my trans partner- and I put it on and just bawled. I looked in the mirror and for the first time since middle school I didn't hate my body. I thought I would just wear it around the house to see how I felt, but I've been having to remind myself every day that it's unhealthy to wear it more than eight hours and I *have* to take it off now. My friends took me shopping for masc clothing and I was able to shop without a panic attack. In fact, since I've started wearing it my social anxiety has basically dropped to nothing. I can dress for dates with my partner and not cry because nothing I own looks right or good enough, I wear more than sweatpants and baggy shirts, and I even have a better relationship with my jiggly tummy (I realized recently I'd been interpreting my womanly curves and breasts as just extra fat-bags on my chest and I felt horrible with them). 

So my main problem with my internal debate is that I don't know where I draw the line between just being pleased that I can achieve the ""butch aesthetic"" which I've always desired in one way or another, or if I need to do some more searching, and if so, down what avenue. 

(tmi?) I've felt before that I've had a ""lack"" of a penis, mostly when sleeping with women and I'd just make up for it by placing my fingers in front of my pelvis, and until my current relationship I've always been a pure top because it never felt... Right? Having other people touch me like that? But these are all things that could just be like super uuber butch feelings. 

So that's my question to others- I live in a trans house but not with any other lesbian identified AFABs so I'm asking you, dear internet- I'm wondering if anyone who is in that identity/considered it before can chat with me a bit about how you drew the line between them because gender is messy and confusing, and a butch identity allows for so much masculinity!

☆Okay, so this is pretty basic but it's worth a mention. Get yourself a self care pack. You can do this irl, but on your phone too. If you want to do this in real life, then gather stuff that would comfort you, when your gender dysphoria kicks in. For example, write nice messages on pieces of paper, and put them in a jar, or bottle or whatever you feel like. And when you feel bad, just get a random one out, read it, and then put it back, and mix the jar/bottle/whatever up again. Also, having lots of blankets, movies, youtube or netflix nearby is a pretty neat solution too. Now hurrs the kicker. How do you do it on your phone? Well, for example, download cute games, put them into a folder called ""Self care"" or ""You are valid"" or something like that. Also, having a playlist of comforting videos, and songs helps too.

123,2017-10-26 05:24:05,78tiqi,6,9,"As the title says, this is my ""so I think maybe I'm trans"" post (I guess that makes me prospective MtF). Basic story, I graduated college in '16 so I'm 23. 

I've always been teased for being less masculine. I wouldn't say ""effeminate"" is definitely the right word, but loud, boisterous, (I like to think) kind and sensitive. Fashionable (again, I like to think) artistic, not athletic at all, and until a few years ago, pretty overweight.

I thought my body/gender issues were a weight problem and—while that certainly didn't help matters—I've lost a lot of weight over the last 5 years, and have been in pretty good shape for the past 3. The first year of weight loss, I was doing great and was super confident, etc. but after a while it wore off. I've been very depressed the last couple of years, and have had a pretty bleak outlook, but have managed to suppress anything bad, and have just sort of coasted through life, always feeling like something is off.

I thought for the last year or so that perhaps I was gay, and that's been a pretty pressing thought in my mind, but I've never been sure, and It never felt super good to identify that way, and imagining myself in a relationship with a cis-guy didn't really feel super great. I talked to a few friends about this, but haven't really acted on it.

About a week ago, it donned on me that maybe I'm trans, and it really was like the sky opened up and I just sort of had this ""HOLY. SHIT."" Moment. I was shopping online and typed in ""sweatpants"" and was taken to the women's section of the website by chance (or fate maybe, jk don't believe in fate). I was all like ""well there's no real difference in women's sweatpants than men's, and they were cheaper, so I was browsing and I looked at this female supermodel and I just thought ""fuck, I want to be you."" And it was like one of the biggest ""AHA!"" Moments I've had. 

I've been looking into it, and heard about the magic Button test and I feel like I'd do that in a heartbeat, but the magic button doesn't exist.

I've looked through some subreddits and have seen people transitioning and am terrified to think that I would be in a phase where I'm presenting, but not passing at all. I mean NO disrespect when I say that AT ALL, and I realize that's 100% a personal problem. I'm just such a self conscious person, that I feel like I would feel worse about my looks if I were in that stage than I do now.

That being said, I've tried being a little more effeminate in my presentation/mannerism the last week, and I haven't been in such a good mood in years. I've felt very very confident and comfortable, and the idea of one day presenting full female actually sounds really great! 

But so many of my gender issues, I feel, stem from trying to be a guy in a world where a guy has to be ABC, and being criticized for not being that. I'm afraid that transitioning may be even worse for me in that regard.

I'm also afraid of me thinking this is something helpful to do now but then the depression will just come right back and I'll realize that's not the right choice and wasn't the root of it at all. I wish we lived in a world where everyone was free to just slide around the gender scale as they saw fit; to dip their toes in the water, if you will. But we don't and I'm afraid of both trying and not having it help, and also of not trying at all. 

Also very afraid of my parents/family reaction, I think my parents would be cool but maybe not, I have no idea.

Lastly I was looking up gender-based subreddits and saw ""gender critical"" and that scared the shit out of me and made me feel horrible and afraid as well. 

TL;DR: I'm afraid. 

Anyways, and help or advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

When I was very young, I told myself it was because then it would be acceptable to like the things I liked (catching critters outside, building forts, the way I was comfortable dressing) and I wouldn't be bullied as much. At this time in my life my abusive mother (was in foster care, have had three abusive mothers) cut off my hair as a punishment and people started to mistake me for a boy. I was elated. At this point I started having people call me by a more masculine version of my current name. When people pointed out ""but that's a boys name!"" it made happy. 
But I didn't identify as trans or a boy, I just wished I were one and was happy when people mistook me for one.

When I was a little older I said it was so that I could date girls without being judged .


then I was sexually abused for 9 months and I told myself it was because I wanted to be big and strong and able to defend myself. I had an eating disorder, I hated my body, and I kept telling myself that I don't like dressing like a girl because I'm just not comfortable with my body and once the eating disorder was better I'd be more comfortable. The eating disorder got better, I came out as gay, I started dating girls and it just didn't go away.
I was explaining all this to my girlfriend one night, while a bit loopy on sleeping meds, and how if I could just sew up my lady bits I'd be so much happier because I get nothing from them existing, and that I hate having to buy clothes that accommodate my breasts, and I just hate being so short and weak and she said... ""are you maybe trans?"" That was the first time I'd ever considered that it was anything other than a bunch of separate reasons.
From there, I tried dressing ""like a man"" and suddenly I realized that the reason I felt so uncomfortable in dresses and skirts wasn't that I hated my body, it was the clothes I was wearing. what seemed to be depression- wearing sweatpants and tshirts under coats everywhere all the time - went away and suddenly I cared about dressing nicely every day as long as I didn't have to wear feminine clothing. I didn't despise and feel awkward wearing makeup because I was self hating and lazy I just hated make up- and that was ok. I got all my hair cut off, as my mom had done except not a hack job- loved it. I started wearing super tight sports bras and that got rid of a lot of anxiety for me. The other day someone mistook me for a man and called me sir and it made my entire day. All day I was confident.

Taylor started working at my work a few months ago.

Although always subconsciously being uncomfortable with my gender and constantly hating the fact I could never seem to fit in with girls at all, I was taught and fully believed that there are two genders, and your genitalia determines which gender you are. 

Since my deconversion and bipolar disorder diagnosis, I've gone through a LOT of questioning, shifting feelings, and frustration.

During my worst periods of depression I felt almost completely masculine, but didn't feel any dysphoria due to my female body. I just hated being perceived as a girl. I seriously thought about transitioning for a long time, but later was really glad I hadn't because I discovered that in sexual situations, I almost always feel like a girl and love it.

After a couple suicide attempts and visits to the mental hospital, I decided I was agender since gender for some reason just didn't matter to me anymore. This bothered my then-boyfriend, and he broke up with me, inadvertently pushing me back to feeling more masculine.

I felt very masculine for a long time, but felt no need to change my physical body. Dressing and acting like a man was enough, so I identified as a demiboy.

As my mental health improved, I swung back to feeling more gender neutral and feminine, so I thought, ""Of course! I must be genderfluid.""
For a few months my feelings and identity didn't change, and I was somewhere between feminine and neutral. Then suddenly, I had a bad violent episode which was foreshadowed by my swinging quickly to the masculine side of the spectrum.

Since I've gotten things under control, I don't really know what I am. I look in the mirror and don't see a gender. I hate the idea of coming out as genderfluid to people because one, my Christian family already think I'm a mental case, and two, I'm too anxious about how I'm perceived by others.

Like, I want people to call me a princess but in a boy way??? But I don’t think I want to dress femme. I just want to like… exude cute boyhood from the very core of my being.

Before then, I would have some fantasies about dressing in drag or whathaveyou, but I never really considered what that meant. I was born a dude, and I never really questioned it. I just thought that I could live with it, that while I did have desires of wearing skirts and leggings, growing out my hair, and having a more feminine voice, that those desires were manageable, that I could live the rest of my life as a man without too much trouble.

For a while in my second year of university (I've since graduated) I participated a little with my uni's queer group/club, presenting as a straight cis ally. I hung out quite a few times and attempted to make friends, but from my Christian upbringing, I still had some really bad LGBT-phobic hangups that made me really insecure about hanging out with them, because I didn't want to say something stupid and hurt someone's feelings. Because of this, most of my activity in the LGBT crowd was online, since I felt more comfortable writing than speaking. I spent a lot of time on reddit, on leftist and LGBT subs lurking and occasionally talking about what it means to be LGBT, and I learned a lot. I learned about genderqueer issues, trans issues, bisexuality, all that jazz, and I had no problems with accepting that these groups existed, and I even started identifying myself as bisexual with a heavy leaning toward the straight side of the spectrum.

But more recently, about 6 weeks ago, I was lurking through the greatest sub ever invented /r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns  and I stumbled across a meme, and as silly as it sounds, things really clicked. I realized that maybe my self-ascribed cis-ness isn't as rock solid as I initially thought it was, that my occasional desires of dressing up, of changing my voice, and growing out my hair weren't just random stray desires, but actually pointed to something about myself that I wasn't addressing. I then dived into research, asked some questions, asked my supportive sister for help, and started looking for therapists, because this isn't going away right now, and this cycle of doubt leading to self-acceptance leading back to doubt isn't going to stop.

I want to start dressing in a more androgynous style, without making it obvious that I am. If that makes sense. As much as I'm not fond of being male/presenting as male, I want to keep up general appearances that I am while still dressing in a more feminine or gender neutral way. 

So far I've found that the more plain looking women's skinny jeans work great, and I absolutely love the way they feel, but the trouble is that I live in Central Florida and it's too damn hot to wear them except in ""winter."" My dream outfit is to wear some nice feminine(ish) plaid/flannel, the skinny jeans, and some nice unisex boots, but it is way too hot to wear it in Florida, and I'll be stuck here another three years for university.

So what kind of shirts, and even shorts, can I wear that start edging towards an andro look?

As a side note, I've been growing out my hair and I need to get it cut soon. Right now it looks a little like [this](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhair2011.files.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F01%2F2010shaggyhairstyleformens_12.jpg&amp;f=1) except it's blonde and a little less thick.

Sometimes I like to think of myself as a woman. Then other times I see myself as nothing more than your usual guy.

(Context: I'm biologically male, and I present as predominantly male while at work, but I feel and/or present as a feminine-ish male at many points. Also, I'm kind of drunk while I'm typing this. It's a four day weekend for me because of Columbus Day, so if shit doesn't make logical sense at any points, that's why.)

I look at myself in the mirror, and I see my bulking arms and six pack and think to myself, ""I REALLY like this. I want to improve this body image and be pretty exclusively male.""

Then during many times throughout the day, I look at myself and think, ""Gosh, I hate my male body. I wish I was a woman. I would love to have boobs and a pretty, slim body like my wife."" (I'm married to a biological female who also identifies as genderqueer and who presents predominantly as female).

Sometimes I say to my reflection in the mirror, ""I wish I was born a biological female who was a trans male. Buff but with a vagina."" Other times I say, ""I'm glad I was born biologically male, because I can be a woman when I transition but still have my dick.""

This is a constant and daily struggle for me. I want to transition to female, but I don't. I want to be a woman so I could transition to male, but at the same time, I want to be feminine. At points I share and feel characteristics of both feminine and masculine personalities. WTF?!!

What/who am I?

Am I a woman? Am I a man? Is this what genderqueer people always feel? To many of my coworkers, they think I want to be a woman, but to me, I want to be a man and a woman and kind of both-ish, kind of. If that makes any sense...

I wish there was just some magic/science that would let me flip a switch to be whatever I wanted at that moment. Actually, I wouldn't mind being a woman permanently if I was the pretty girl I want to be, but then again, I like my huge muscles... Son of a bitch...

So yeah... can anyone relate? Am I alone in these thoughts?

Again, kind of drunk right now. I apologize. I don't have a drinking problem. I just have a problem expressing myself sometimes.

Thank you.

45,2017-10-08 09:39:25,750tse,6,7,"Hey y'all! I'm new to being genderqueer, this thread, and actually Reddit completely (I only just created a Reddit to find some NB/GQ community), and I have a bunch of questions that I'd appreciate some insight on! I'll try to seperate them clearly to make what I'm sure will be a super long post more manageable :)

Pronouns: 

Are there any good singular ones out there? I've been using they/them because I don't like anything else I've seen (Ze/zir or xe/xir) and I was wondering if there were more gender neutral pronouns I hadn't heard of.

Also I need some advice on how to deal with being misgendered. After I realized I was genderqueer, being misgendered began to feel like an electric shock. It makes me feel absolutely horrible, and usually I'm too stunned to respond and correct people. When strangers do it, I get too scared to say anything because I have no idea if that person is going to further invalidate me (or do something even worse?); when it's people I know, I fall into an immediate depression since being misgendered means they are failing to recognize something so important to me and my identity (as I've come out to most people I know). So I was wondering what I can do to get over this shock and even just how to correct people when they misgender me. Right now I have a community of people who take a lot of the pressure off by correcting people when they slip up on my pronouns, but I want to be able to speak up for myself.

Feminism:

Does anyone have any resources from genderqueer/nonbinary on their relationship with feminism? Being AFAB I was a pretty hardcore feminist until recently, when both my better informed leftist ideology and newly realized genderqueer identity have put a rift between me and feminism. I was wondering if anyone has explored this topic and how to repair or replace my relationship with the feminist movement, which had such a big impact in my life.

Tiddies: 

Can any AFAB people (esp those who have/had a bigger chest) offer some advice on complete top surgery v reduction? I don't have debilitating dysphoria or anything, but I don't like my chest. Like, I spend a bunch of time in the mirror pushin them out of the way, getting excited about how I look with them hidden at certain angles, and doing what I can to minimize how they look underclothing. But I constantly hear this voice in my head saying ""you only want them gone bc they're a big reason you get misgendered/they're so big and saggy they're not even attractive anymore/they cause so much back pain/they're just annoying"". Sometimes I even like being a little femme and enjoy the aesthetic so that also complicates my feelings on the issue. Plus my partner loves them, and when he's on them I don't really mind that I have them.
I'm really thinking about getting a reduction down to maybe a B or a C cup — something that can look like a flat chest with just a sports bra and a calculated outfit. I feel like 93% of the time I want to be flat, but I don't want to feel limited for that small 7% of the time I want to feel femme and a lil curvy. Has anyone done this and if so how satisfied were you? Is this easier to get insurance to cover because I'm sure I have enough back issues to actually warrant a Breast reduction? How do I not feel like a bad queer for not wanting the more masc look of full top surgery?

And in the meantime, does anyone know of any brands that make more masc/neutral bras in my size (32H)? I know this is a tall order bc honestly just finding places that make bras in my size at all is so difficult. But I just bought some masc underwear and it's really improved my comfort and confidence, except now my bras and therefore my chest seem more feminine embellished in tiny bows and lace and satin fabrics.

Identiddies: 

What made you tend toward the genderqueer label? And do you ever use other labels with or instead of GQ? I've been using it just because it seemed as though it had the most room for interpretation, which has been helpful as I do more and more gender exploring, but I'm curious what connotations y'all have with the term.

Just a few days ago, I realized that I no longer felt that I identified with the gender I was assigned at birth. It was all instantly clear to me: that the insecurity about my body and male identity that I have felt since middle school was gender dysphoria.  

However, while I am now certain that I don't relate to the gender I was assigned at birth, I'm not sure exactly how to locate myself in terms of gender. 

Having done some research, I think that I might be genderqueer--I honestly feel more feminine than masculine, but I don't feel much real body dysphoria (largely because my body isn't exactly masculine). 

The problem is, I don't know too much about liminal gender identities, and I'm really not sure where to start. Are there any good places to start in terms of books, videos, testimonies, etc. that could help me figure out what my identity really is? I would appreciate it a ton.

70,2017-10-15 23:01:16,76me1j,5,4,"Hi folks! 

I’m brand new to reddit. I feel a little bit overwhelmed at the prospect of introducing myself and trying to explain my background, but I'm going to give it a shot. At the end of this post, I’m going to ask some questions - in case you want to just skip straight to those.  

I’m AFAB, 28 years old, and I’ve been part of the queer community/out as queer for 11 years now. I've had complicated feelings about my gender for about the same amount of time. My gender (and my sexuality) have always kind of felt like moving, shifting things, but that hasn't stopped me from trying to pin them down or make them stay still. 
 
I've employed a number of strategies to that end, some of which involved ways of identifying or taking up labels, and some of which involved more material actions, like disavowing makeup for a period of time, or, alternatively, embracing makeup fully and wearing it every day. It usually works for a while and I feel stable in my identity, until things shift again.

In recognition of this, I’ve been identifying these days as gender fluid, and also genderqueer and non-binary (although I think claiming those identities for myself feels a bit more scary, for a few reasons). I’ve also felt some resonance with the terms bi-gender and androgyne. 

I've tried a number of times to get comfortable in the identity of Femme, because a) I think a lot of people assume that's how I identify, and it would make sense to a large degree. I have and continue to present in a way that many people would consider feminine. I often wear mascara, I don't often bind, right now I have long hair (it's a mullet - ha!), and (I think this is key) all those things on a body that was assigned female at birth are interpreted as feminine, or as femme. And b) I've wanted to identify as femme because I think that for a lot of other people, genderfluid and genderqueer people included, femme feels like a constant, a home, something they can always come back to, an undercurrent that's always there. That seems very appealing to me. I would like to have that. But while I'm arguably femme-presenting, I just can't seem to make Femme fit for myself. 

Mostly the strategy I've used to deal with my unwieldy identity has been to try not to think about it. That has seemed easier than trying to figure out what's going on with me, much less trying to put words to it. I haven't really had the words. Until recently, it hadn't occurred to me that someone femme/femme-presenting who was assigned female at birth could identify as non-binary. The first time I read about it, I was like ""Oh. Ohhhh. Oh fuck."" Surprise, then resonance. And then dread, on some level... It felt a bit like opening a huge can of worms. I had come across an article by Sam Escobar - have any of you come across them in your internet wanderings? They’re an editor at Allure magazine… Anyway, I’ll link to some of the articles I read at the end of my post.  

I think another factor that prevented me from coming to understand myself as non-binary or genderqueer was the relationship I had been in. I spent the better part of 10 years in a relationship wherein there wasn't space for me in any kind of meaningful or safe way - not my feelings, not my identity, especially if those things were contrary or threatening to my partner's. It was part of an overarching theme/power imbalance in that relationship, that resulted in the focus always coming to rest on my partner and his identity and his gender. I very often felt that it was part of my ""job"" in the relationship to validate or prop up my partner's masculinity by appearing feminine - really, by appearing to be a straight, cis woman. The focus was on my partner's gender, and I didn't feel like there was space to think about mine, never mind question it. I'm not in that relationship anymore, thankfully. 

I'm in a different relationship now, where there is all kinds of space for me to think about and question my gender, and present however the hell I want (which, I find, is easier said than done). Over the past number of months, a few things related to my gender have come up because of my relationship. For one thing, I've begun to acknowledge some desires that I have that are gender or sex-related (in both senses of the word). I’m still in the process of figuring out the implications (or lack thereof) of the stuff that I’ve acknowledged/admitted to myself. I feel very grateful that there is space in my relationship for this stuff, although I still have a very hard time trusting that that will continue to be the case (just because of past relationship baggage).

 The other thing that has come up is that I feel unexpectedly invested in not being read as a heterosexual woman, which I guess makes sense - I just care way more about this now than I have in the past. My current partner is on testosterone, and as they are read increasingly as a guy by the world, I feel myself pushing back against any potential collapsing of my identity under heteronormativity. There’s this weird fucking thing that happens when AFAB femme-presenting people are partnered with folks who the world assumes identify as men; people seem to assume that the partners of men must be straight cis women. At least, that’s what my experience has been. And I really don’t want that to happen. Only now, I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t want to be unintelligible as queer, or if it’s due to my discomfort with identifying as a woman. I think I feel more pressure (or put more pressure on myself) to present in a more masculine way sometimes as a result of all this, and I’m trying to tease out when that is the case. 

And here’s another thing: I’m pretty scared of the implications of claiming a non-binary identity. I’m scared of what I will find if I start to explore my identity more. 

When my current partner and I started dating, they identified as non-binary, and they are definitely in touch with their femininity. During the time we’ve been together, they’ve started testosterone, and it’s turing out to be a really good fit for them. Seeing them move through their process around their gender and around their trans identity has been really interesting for me, because they haven’t followed what is often called the “typical” trans narrative or path, and I can relate to aspects of their experience; some of it resonates with me. And I can also relate to the experiences of other non-binary folks, like Sam Escobar, and like other folks in my community. 

I guess the thing is, I always thought on some level (probably a subconscious one) that because I’m comfortable wearing makeup a lot of the time, and because I have liked and identified with things that are typically deemed feminine throughout my life - because I have presented femininely (and do!) and liked it, I couldn’t be non-binary, and I definitely could not be trans. But with all of these new realizations and new ways of being and identifying - and specifically, with people who look like me claiming non-binary identities - now I’m not so sure. About any of it. And it’s a beautiful, beautiful thing, and it’s also deeply unsettling and terrifying. It scares the shit out of me.

I’d be really curious to know if any of you have had similar experiences or thoughts, and what your journeys have been to identifying however you identify.

Do you use they/them pronouns, and how do you deal with people fucking them up? I feel like I’ve done a lot of gender labour in my life, and I’m worried that going by they/them pronouns (even if it might feel better for me) would amount to a huge amount of work. I’m scared to take that on. 

I would also really love to know - for those of you who identify as gender fluid - how that plays out for you, and how you deal with it. Sometimes the way I feel about my gender shifts in the middle of the day, and it’s hard to deal with… Any strategies? 

And one final question: are you out about your identity, and to what extent? Do you have strategies that you use that help you feel visible and/or valid? I've come out many times before with different aspects of my identity, but I'm really scared to come out about this one. I'm afraid people won't believe me or see my identity as valid, essentially.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. &lt;3

73,2017-10-16 04:29:41,76o630,13,14,While I enjoy having sex I've always had a very strange view of it. The thought of people finding me attractive makes me feel threatened and disgusted with myself and my body. I feel like people looking at me or noticing me in a sexual way or otherwise traps me in my body and I can't escape. I don't want to be seen as a girl but that isn't really the thought going through my head when I'm having these feelings.

Months ago I decided to stopped my MtF hrt because it wasn't making me feel better with myself,indeed,it made feel emotionally the worst I've ever felt,I knew it wasn't the right path for me because I was missing so bad my old appearance and I wasn't feeling related to the new body I was achieving so after a huge emotional collapse I stopped totally my hrt.

Nowadays I still feel great about keep presenting as a guy,I'm getting my beard back and I like it a lot (even if my family thinks is weird to see me with beard again),I'm working out so I'm building a nice body, I mean, I have no body dysphoria at all,I like my whole body,also I'm ok with my gender role (I don't fit in all ""male"" groups but...whatever)I don't care to be called Mr,young man,dude,guy,etcetera anymore so, I'm totally fine living my life as a guy.

》The main situation is: Now, I feel so great about being a guy and I have no dysphoria at all but in some of the happiest moments or the most calmed, relaxing situations I always ask myself in my head...-Would I have been happier if I had not stopped my hrt? I would've been way happier if I would've been born physically a woman- 

Mostly in every situation I'm going through, I think it would have been better living it as a woman,but  if I try to picture myself as a trans girl now,I can't do it.

What does that mean? I have no dysphoria, I don't feel trans,I like being a man but why I keep thinking that way?
 It's been a couple of weeks with that thought so today I decided to take some of the pills I kept and I felt so happy for taking them over again...what is wrong with me??? I don't want to reduce my male characteristics and obviously hrt will do.

Am I a trans girl even if I'm so ok whith being a man?

I'm not gonna lie,I would have loved having been born physically a woman,but I'm ok with being a man now,although every time someone ask me for example what artists I would like to be or look alike,I always say female celebrities names...does that mean something? 

I remember all those trans women telling me that I'm not a cis guy,I never were and never will,because cis guys don't ask themselves about their gender and even start hrt. That I'll always be trans,that I will end up taking hrt again ,I'm so afraid it will be true. 

I thought I was genderqueer or genderfluid but now I just feel as a cis average guy....what do you guys think??? Is it wrong to start taking my old hrt  pills over again even if I'm totally ok about being a guy?

Besides, it is too hard for me to see myself in a gay relationship, I always see myself in the ""woman's side"" when I see a couple,but I'm not a feminine gay guy.

I'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this or not but I'm not really sure where else to go and I don't really know anyone in my life who can relate. 

Quick disclaimer and a little background; everyone in my life is super accepting and awesome. I'm a bi female which I realised years ago and everyone knows; I have a gay brother and my parents are more than supportive and honestly the best parents somebody could hope for. I have a lot of gay/bi friends and honestly don't think any of my friends are homophobic or transphobic at all. However if myself or anyone in my story does come across as intolerant it's probably just confusion of the situation and a lack of knowing anyone going through a similar thing so not fully understanding. 

So recently I've been thinking i might be gender fluid. I'm super confused and have loads of questions and just thoughts and I apologise if this is just sort of ranting. 

So some background, I've always sort of been a mixture of tomboy and girly, like I've never really fit in with either. I'm not sporty or into makeup (I know these are stereotypes but it's just sort of a good example?). In high school I went through stages of loving dresses and nothing else and times when I wore nothing but men's clothing. There was definitely a year or two when I did question my gender but realised I do enjoy being a girl so I couldn't be a guy (didn't really think about other options hahah). 

So what got me thinking about it this time was about a month ago (I know it's not that long) my mum asked me about which I would chose if I could come back in another life as a male or female. She said female and I argued male, because as much as I love being a woman I'd love to see the other side of things, plus don't you have those days when you just feel like a male? She just looked at me confused and said no I don't have those days (again not judging just confused). This got me thinking about my gender for the first time in a while and I was like wait do people not have those days when they want to be a boy? I thought everyone had that. 
The next dayI had an event to go to where I needed to wear a dress and it got me all anxious and nervous and so I was messaging a friend just ranting and saying how I don't feel like wearing a dress and why are my boobs here I just want them to go away. She responded confused like what do you mean, your boobs are awesome? I said yeah some days I do really love them but I'm just having one of those times when I don't want them there at all. She was confused and saying how no she'd never felt that. I too was confused, again asking doesn't everyone just have those days and these thoughts?? 
Later that week after I'd been thinking about these things, I was dressed in baggy pants and a T with some friends who were loving how androgynous I look and I was like yeah I feel like a boy it's awesome. Then a friend said half jokingly something like 'why aren't you just non binary' and it was like everything in my life just clicked. Yes actually that does sound kind of right. That would explain a lot. Is that me? 

It explains why I have days feeling like a male when others don't feel that. Or why I feel like my breasts don't belong on my body sometimes; or why when everyone looked at models and felt bad about themselves I loved my androgynous look and didn't care for a typical female body (or one at all?) I always wanted to grow a beard, and Is my penis envy just about being able to pee wherever or is there more to it? 

I then went into full panic mode for about a week. I know nothing about this, what does it mean? Who even am I now?? 
I started reading a bunch of non binary blogs and definitions and just whatever I could find and felt like gender fluid fit me the best. Some days female, some days male, some days in between. Yep that basically sums up my whole life and why one day I hate hate hate dresses and heels and the next I'm like this is so fun I feel so fancy! 

But now I'm just sort of stuck and lost. I'm not sure what I'm meant to do now? What I'm meant to think about to know if this is right or if not why am I having these thoughts?

Everything has suddenly become harder too, a month ago I got up felt like a dress and put it on and it was great; or felt like baggy pants and an oversize shirt and loved the occasional questioning look I got. I'd be out and knew I looked like a boy but it didn't matter. Now I go out and I'm sort of trying to actually pull of being a boy, like I want people to think that and then suddenly I feel weird when people know I'm a girl, or I feel weird because I go to the female bathrooms and I'm trying to be a boy? 
In some ways it's been freeing like I've been wearing a sports bra with this singlet over and makes me so flat chested and I feel amazing, but then at the same time I'm nervous to run into somebody cos I look like a boy, even though it's exactly how I dressed before??  

I know a lot of what I've been saying has been related to clothing and I get that that isn't what defines genderqueer or trans people but it's been when getting dressed that I've felt most these things.  

Ive spoken to a couple friends who were all like yeah you're only just thinking this? (I seriously thought everyone had these thoughts and I never second guessed the actual thoughts!) 

I don't know what I'm meant to do from here either. My friends either are or will be supportive but they can only really listen not offer help. I messaged this friend of a friend who I've meet a couple times who has some genderqueer friends and she said we could all meet as a group but I'm not sure if any are (female at birth? Is that a correct term? I don't wanna be offensive and nothing against males at birth I just want somebody who fully gets everything like chest dysphoria). 
I just feel so clueless and lost. I thought I knew who I was and now I don't know how to dress myself or present myself and my anxiety is going though the roof, like it has not been this bad in two years. 
Im having so many new thoughts and feelings; the other day I was putting a skirt on and I felt like I was a boy who was dressing as a girl but wanted to dress as a girl. That's definitely a new feeling. 

I don't know if I've really asked a question or if any of this is even coherent and I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I guess just general advice or maybe I just needed a place to let this all out. I'm not sure. But any response is appreciated and thanks so much to anyone who read all the way to the end.

I'm a bi female which I realised years ago and everyone knows; I have a gay brother and my parents are more than supportive and honestly the best parents somebody could hope for. I have a lot of gay/bi friends and honestly don't think any of my friends are homophobic or transphobic at all. However if myself or anyone in my story does come across as intolerant it's probably just confusion of the situation and a lack of knowing anyone going through a similar thing so not fully understanding. \n\nSo recently I've been thinking i might be gender fluid. I'm super confused and have loads of questions and just thoughts and I apologise if this is just sort of ranting. \n\nSo some background, I've always sort of been a mixture of tomboy and girly, like I've never really fit in with either. I'm not sporty or into makeup (I know these are stereotypes but it's just sort of a good example?). In high school I went through stages of loving dresses and nothing else and times when I wore nothing but men's clothing. There was definitely a year or two when I did question my gender but realised I do enjoy being a girl so I couldn't be a guy (didn't really think about other options hahah). \n\nSo what got me thinking about it this time was about a month ago (I know it's not that long) my mum asked me about which I would chose if I could come back in another life as a male or female. She said female and I argued male, because as much as I love being a woman I'd love to see the other side of things, plus don't you have those days when you just feel like a male? She just looked at me confused and said no I don't have those days (again not judging just confused). This got me thinking about my gender for the first time in a while and I was like wait do people not have those days when they want to be a boy? I thought everyone had that. \nThe next dayI had an event to go to where I needed to wear a dress and it got me all anxious and nervous and so I was messaging a friend just ranting and saying how I don't feel like wearing a dress and why are my boobs here I just want them to go away. She responded confused like what do you mean, your boobs are awesome? I said yeah some days I do really love them but I'm just having one of those times when I don't want them there at all. She was confused and saying how no she'd never felt that. I too was confused, again asking doesn't everyone just have those days and these thoughts?? \nLater that week after I'd been thinking about these things, I was dressed in baggy pants and a T with some friends who were loving how androgynous I look and I was like yeah I feel like a boy it's awesome. Then a friend said half jokingly something like 'why aren't you just non binary' and it was like everything in my life just clicked. Yes actually that does sound kind of right. That would explain a lot. Is that me? \n\nIt explains why I have days feeling like a male when others don't feel that. Or why I feel like my breasts don't belong on my body sometimes; or why when everyone looked at models and felt bad about themselves I loved my androgynous look and didn't care for a typical female body (or one at all?) I always wanted to grow a beard, and Is my penis envy just about being able to pee wherever or is there more to it? \n\nI then went into full panic mode for about a week. I know nothing about this, what does it mean? Who even am I now?? \nI started reading a bunch of non binary blogs and definitions and just whatever I could find and felt like gender fluid fit me the best.

102,2017-10-23 02:28:01,784snw,13,13,"Not sure how redundant this exact post is, but here goes...

Let me start off with what I know: I know I have a penis, I know I have a girlfriend who I am extremely romantically and sexually attracted to, I know I'm comfortable with male pronouns, and i know I've had no quarrels with being cisgender for my entire 17 year life so far (up until this point). 

However, I also know that I have a desire to adopt feminine aesthetics (paint nails, wear makeup), I know I am intrigued by and not at all uncomfortable with sexual experiences involving other men, I know while masculinity can feel natural to me it can also feel like a false version of me at times, and that femininity usually excites me and makes me feel like I'm really showcasing myself. I also know that for years and years I always have jumped at the chance to do feminine or at least not traditionally masculine things... *""ironically""*. For me, male-ness is comfortable but also female-ness is empowering.

Now here is what I don't know: I obviously still feel pretty natural following a plethora of male social structures, so is this a sign that at the end of the day I am still a cisgender person who just likes 'girly stuff', OR is my comfort in manhood only a result of me being told and accepting that I'm a guy that will do guy stuff because of my chromosomes/dick for my entire life? I know for sure that femininity is a big part of who I am deep down, but I guess the confusion comes from: am i just a girly cisgender or does this really mean something? 

I'll end this by saying that to be completely honest I really feel like I may be genderqueer, but I think the newness of this becoming a question I am *actually* asking myself is scaring me off. Almost like I'm doubting myself because ""oh if you were *really* genderqueer you would've figured it out by now.""

If the answer seems obvious, no matter what it is, just keep in mind that these are some questions I didn't even know were possible until a year ago. OH and also if it seems like I think sexuality and gender are the same thing from the text: I don't, I just can't help that my sexual desires are something my brain keeps bringing up when I argue with myself.

I am 31, AMAB, and from West Lancashire, United Kingdom.

I want to tell them that I am genderfluid [I live at home with my parents] but currently am unsure of the best way to discuss it with them.

I have Asperger's Syndrome, which may or may not be relevant to this issue.

As it is, I've been taking being genderfluid very slowly.

Some things are certain with my genderfluidity - I'm still attracted to women, and largely feminine-looking/girly-girl-type women, same as when I am male. I'm also not likely to treat my birth name as a dead name, but my female name [when/if I've chosen one] as a secondary name.

In terms of pronouns, I use he when I'm as my normal AMAB self, she when presenting as female, rather than they/them which sounds third-person [for me, anyway] - if it works for others, that's OK, but it's not for me.

I don't want to do a big coming-out related talk to them [isn't that the stereotype of coming out] but equally it's not something I can just drop into conversation. 

I haven't told friends or co-workers about this, but they don't need to know, even though my workplace has a good equality policy [I can't really talk much about my work for reasons relating to Data Protection Act 1998, other than to say I work with disabled adults and do paperwork regarding this].

I don't want them to think I'm transgender or a ""drag queen"" stereotype, but equally, I want to try and be sensitive about this issue.

My parents are accepting of most things, but I do have uncertainties about how to tell them in a good way.

I can't move out for financial reasons and because I haven't quite got the life skills to cope with living away from home permanently. [this partially relates to my point on Asperger's Syndrome, above].

I recently came out to my parents as genderqueer/nonbinary/exploring my gender identity.  I felt I wanted to let them know I had started this process so it's less of a shock if I need to make medical changes to myself in the future.  My mom was pretty accepting and started using gender neutral pronouns with me and corrected herself for misgendering me ^.^ (I use they/them pronouns).  My dad just said I had a limited view of what a woman was (I'm biologically female) and needed to expand that view.  He works in the STEM fields and sees all kinds of women breaking stereotypes everyday and he's proud of me for graduating with a STEM degree and starting grad school.  While I understand his point, I still can't shake this internal knowledge that I am not female and that that identity makes me feel uncomfortable about my body and my socialization.  I identify as more masculine than feminine in most areas of my life.  But I also can't shake his words and as a former very vocal feminist I feel as if I'm abandoning a movement that I needed in order to pursue STEM fields and find my happiness as a statistician.

#Sexualities:

**Pansexual** -- have never been with a binary female, but have been attracted to women as a teen.  have had 2-3 experiences with one binary female that deeply aroused me but did not lead to sex

**Polysexual** -- if i am not pansexual and it turns out i am not attracted to non binary women, then I am polysexual, due to being attracted to men, being gynesexual (but not necessarily on a non binary woman, on man) and then skoliosexual:

**Skoliosexual** -- i was with a FTM that i was very attracted to.  had his vagina but not his boobs, but had hair on chest and legs that i loved.  so was deeply attracted that mixture.  have never gone all the way with a binary woman so it's hard to say if im pansexual truly.

**Sapiosexual** -- have found myself with military officers that have an intoxicating affect on me that makes me surrender all logic and everything due to the intelligence and power they command.

i also find myself, on the other side, deeply attracted to nerdy girls!  i know that's simple but i actually love the authenticity of girls with no makeup, glasses, maybe some extra pounds, maybe not, but i think it's the sincerity and intelligence they have, but again, i haven't tested this.

**Sociosexual** -- i have desire to have sex while in a relationship with others outside of the relationship typically due to the multiple needs as shown above


****

#Genders

I have high-functioning autism and epilepsy and it's made everything a little different for me.

***

**Gender Fluid / Bi Gender / DemiFlux / Genderflux / Genderqueer / Non-binary** -- II realize that when playing the submissive role with a man, 75% of the time I will literally become a woman.  i am no longer a man.  25% of the time i submit as a man to another man.  homosexual submission, homosexual domination, and then either transgender/heterosexual domination are the three types of sex i seek out and im trying to identify how my gender plays into these desires.

***

**Gender Non-comformity / Gender variant / Two Spirit** -- very emotional but do not need emotions to have sexual relationships, but find myself very in touch with my emotional side in a feminine way, easy to cry, but i have a full beard, keep all my natural body hair and generally love masculine values even if i am not a traditional man in any way imaginable.... im almost lumbersexual but not with the fashion, just in attitude.  but i have epilepsy so my hands shake.  

**Genderpunk** -- i know it sounds stupid but i really love listening to music that gay men or women would enjoy and in the area i live that means really sharing an intimate side of your identity (and ultimately exposing you as very effeminate).  and lately i feel empowered to sing along because i feel it's deeper than anything, i feel like im connecting with the soul of the musician.  like it just goes so much deeper than anything and in singing and connecting with the effeminate (or sometimes excessively masculine, like in rap or even metal).  for me this always felt very punk in this way i couldn't describe till now

***

**Aliagender / Aporagender** -- XEN -- i am a SPIRIT, beyond man and woman.... when im in this place i am asexual.  then outside of this headspace i encompass some aspects of both man and woman (That last part is my personal understanding of it, but it is not what you would describe the definition as, yet having your own personal definition is the definition itself of alia/apora/gender -- as long as it is a powerful gender-based force)

****

#Conclusions

**Poly Gender / Quad gender** -- the above sections could just mean im polygender: 

part aporagender, 

part gender fluid, 

part gender variant/gender punk, 

part male

I desire to be her but not to the point that I would actually feel in the wrong body and desperately want to physically transition. That would kinda go to far, considering I don't reject my male body like a trans woman does but I kinda do feel like a woman and a gay man at the same time?

13,2017-10-14 16:23:46,76d2rd,6,9,"Hi., 
I'm Aspie, and fit somewhere on the transgender / non-binary / gender fluid spectrum. I'm posting into this community, as I feel this group will be more comfortable with the idea of presenting in more than one way... 

And so, here is where it gets interesting...

I've read gender fluidity as being described as: ""I change over time, sometimes i feel more A, other times more B, other times more C, ... "". In this case, the gender fluid person may choose to change the way they present, to express how they feel.. This is really cool :)   

I would describe this as a person that has multiple modes, and their body switches between modes, and then they choose to present to the public in that mode. 

In my situation i was ""more or less"" presenting in one mode. A non-binary mode where i would combine masculine clothes that fit my body with some sort of skirt/kilt that to my mind expressed a broader feminine component that is an intrinsic part of me.  This was evolving over time, as I was pushing more and more into the feminine space because i felt safer and more validated in that space.

The trouble is, I now live in a country where it is physically unsafe to be LGBT+ [ see Main findings on page 74 of http://women.ge/data/docs/publications/WISG_situation-of-lgbt-persons-in-Georgia_ENG-www.pdf ] I have experienced this myself... Shaving my arms/legs and wearing a bright coloured shirt was enough to be threatened by a group of men. 

So in this case, I'm trying to figure out how I can be ""gender-fluid"", that is ""multi-modal"", where in public i have to present as Cis-Gender White Male to be safe, but where in private i can present with skirts and other items that I feel validate my feminine / non-masculine aspects..

I guess what i'm asking for.. what strategies can I use to maintain my personal integrity, and validate myself, in a multi-modal context. 

I've been working on things like: 
A) in public, i am presenting the best aspects of my masculine self, in a compassionate way, that enables me to leverage ""white male priviledge"" to communicate pro womens/LGBT+ rights in a patriarchal environment safely. 
B) in private, I am presenting and nurturing other aspects of my self, that validate my femininity in balance with masculine and (god help me) technical side. 

The difficulty is, i've forced my self to stop shaving, and have had to give up all thoughts of HRT for the forseable 24 months.. And so i have to balance dysphoria with perception of safety. Being an aspie, I need to find a way to manage the constant anxiety regarding safety and inclusion that has played in my life, combined with trying to feel safe in this violently LGBT+ adverse environment. 

I appreciate all constructive input, no matter how challenging or controversial.

I enjoy putting my hair up in braids, and higher ponytails too, but the current cut just feels so bland.  I was wondering if anyone has any advice for a cute, girly cut, that won't draw too much attention when in male mode.  I've tried looking online, but most of what I can find are female bodies hiding their long hair for boy mode, or suggestions on cutting hair shorter. Not many resources for semi androgynous cuts.  Any help?"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'long hair', 'created': 1508634856.0}"
