9,2017-09-03 00:11:43,6xpyw7,4,7,"I feel very feminine. I am drawn to physical femininity too. If I see the face of a normal guy, I would never want to look like that, even if he is handsome. When I see very feminine looking cis men who could pass as girls I feel envious of their physical femininity. Same with certain girls. I feel envious of their face and posture.
I have always had a strange feeling towards my penis. In my imagination it is never there. I just don't like it. I don't terribly hate it. I even masturbate. I just don't want it to be touched and I would want to cover it up in a relationship. I intensely hate facial and body hair, dislike my rather manly shoulders and my large masc feet. I wish I would have girly little feet and narrow fem shoulders. I love having a feminine voice and feel very pleased when I'm gendered female on the phone. I would rather want soft facial features than sharp facial features.
I recognise everything trans people experience. It all clicks when I read what other trans people mentally went through.
I feel a strong urge to feminize my body and face.
On days that I feel masculine I want to puke. I hate feeling like a man. On days that I feel girly I'm relaxed and comfortable.
I have no desire to be with a man as a man. Not out of disguest or something like that, it just doesn't feel like me when I imagine my male face and body having sex with a man's body. In my sexual imagination I always imagine myself as a woman with a man.
I feel a strong envy towards trans women, not towards trans men. I feel envious that she gets to look like she looks.
I hate everything masculine because it doesn't feel like me. I love feminine things. Everything feminine.
There is a voice in my head that tells me that maybe I should just live as a feminine gay cis man. When I try to think about that it doesn't feel right because I would be with a partner who expects me to be a man and who would treat me like a man. A gay relationship doesn't appeal to me because that would mean that I still have to be a man in the relationship. There is a very girly gay guy who looks so feminine that I envy his appearence. There is one thing that I don't envy and that is his facial hair. Facial hair makes me depressed and grosses me out. He looks like a girl with short hair and I want his soft features and his tiny feminine body.
I want to be with a partner who treats me like a girl. When I think about pushing a button and being reborn as a woman I don't think I would push that button. I would want the body of that woman but not be viewed by society as a woman. I wish I could have a female body and enjoy male privilege. My desire to have the body of a female is not driven by a sexual force. In fact, I don't relate to crossdressers at all. I'm not aroused by being a woman and I am not focussed on women clothes. It's more a feeling of a woman's body matching with how I feel inside.
When I think about being a woman in society I hate being treated by men as weaker, I would hate not having a big career and I hate never being able to have the status men have. In a perfectly equal world I would push the button to become a woman in every aspect but not in this world.
I had counseling for more than a year and didn't come home any wiser.
From doing my own research I feel a strong connection to trans women living non-op and to very feminine gender non-conforming men with a feminine body, face and mind with almost no male characteristics in their appearence. The desire to have a feminine body and face is very strong and unexplainable. Picturing myself with a very male body makes me extremely depressed and angsty.
Picturing a situation where society sees me as a cis woman feels wrong. Picturing a situation where I can live as a woman while being seen by society as a transitioning individual that is not strictly male or strictly female but more in the middle feels exactly right.
I have this voice in my head telling me that I'm just an effeminate gay men with internalized homophobia. It doesn't ring true though. I experience intense gender dysphoria, hate being seen as male and hate looking male. It also wouldn't feel right if a man saw me as a man. I just don't want to be seen as a man by my partner.
I wish that it was possible to find a balance between male and female. Female body, gender neutral presentation and social status.
I don't know what my future will look like or if I will ever have a partner. I have thought about living as a gender non conforming man and while that could work on the short term it would give me more dysphoria once I will start becoming more manly and age like a man. The route of a fully transitioned post-op trans woman doesn't appeal either. I want to be a person with a feminine body who is not strictly male or female. I just don't know how I can accomplish that.
The route of a non-op trans woman minus her binary gender expression sounds more or less right.
Sometimes I wonder if there are other people like me on the trans spectrum. Who deal with transgender feelings, sometimes think that they are just really gay despite knowing that a complete life in their birth gender doesn't feel right either and who don't want to restrict themselves to just male or female but want to live in the middle and have a body with equal amounts of sex characteristics of both male and female.

So I'm definitely trans and proud, no doubt about that. :) But I'm really lost as to whether I'm binary or non-binary, probably because I'm struggling to figure out exactly what it means to be either binary or non-binary.

A little bit about me: I'm AMAB and pre-everything, but when everything's said and done, I definitely want to be perceived as female. No doubt about that. But I don't know what it ""feels like"" to be male, female, or anything else. While I've pretty much always wished that I had been born a girl, I wouldn't necessarily say that I ""feel like a girl."" It's just that I'm incredibly uncomfortable being perceived as and treated like a guy. And while I would be so much happier if I had been assigned female at birth, I'm not sure if I'd be *totally* comfortable with that assignment, either. It's like the difference between a pair of shoes that's five sizes too small versus a pair that's one size too big. One's definitely more comfortable than the other, but that doesn't make it a perfect fit. And maybe I'll ""grow into these new shoes"" after I officially come out to everyone. Or change my wardrobe. Or change my name and/or pronouns. Or start HRT. Maybe it's just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a binary trans woman. But it may also be just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a femme non-binary person. I'm honestly not sure.

I also wonder if I'm hesitating to call myself a trans woman due to some form of internalized gatekeeping. The way I've explain it to some of my friends, calling myself a woman and using she/her pronouns feels a bit like calling myself a dancer; I'm definitely not ""not a dancer"" (because I do love to dance), but I certainly don't have the years of training and experience that seems to be the prerequisite for calling oneself a dancer. And I know that trans people are the gender they say they are and have every right to refer to themselves as such! But while I believe that wholeheartedly when it comes to other trans people, it's a lot harder to accept that truth for myself. (Or maybe I hesitate to call myself a trans woman because I'm not?

27,2017-09-06 04:34:55,6ydgx7,6,7,"Hey everyone.

I'm 20 years old, AMAB. For a few years now I've had some vague confusion relating to my gender identity. I'm pretty sure that I'm not a full-on trans girl, I don't (think) I experience dysphoria, although I know that it's possible to be one without it, and I am usually happy to present masculinely, even sometimes want to be more masculine. I don't think that's about fulfilling a societal expectation so much as just liking the idea of being big/strong/""manly"".

That being said I also sometimes (keyword sometimes) want to be a girl, basically. Cute, small, pretty. Of course it's possible to be those things while identifying as male but I think this goes a little beyond that. Like sometimes I'll see a woman on the street and kind of envy her, or want to have her body, whatever. I have no idea where that comes from. But again, sometimes I'll see a guy and ""wish"" I looked like him. It's a bit different, not envy usually so much as really liking/wanting to emulate a style or something, but I think that's mostly because I already have a male body.

This kind of extends into sex and relationships, too. I'm bi, or at least identifying that way. Sometimes, I'm a girl in my fantasies (it may or may not be worth noting these fantasies specifically usually have a bdsm element, where I'm the sub) but in others I'm basically who I am right now (and usually am the dom when it gets kinky). Obviously there's some patriarchy reflected in the kinky stuff, but I don't think that's at the root of my desires.

I seem to like being masculine when I'm involved with women and being feminine around guys. That's probably an internalization of some kind of straight cultural ideal, but it's the way it is. I dated this guy for a while, and sort of experimented with playing up my feminine side around him, (like I shaved my legs and wore women's t-shirts), and while I kind of enjoyed that, I wouldn't really want to do it around girls. I find myself most emotionally comfortable around girls as well. The only people I've ever really been in love with were women, and most of my friends are as well. Dunno whether that means anything.

Basically, what do you all think? I'd appreciate advice from any perspective. I'm not cis-cis, at least I don't think, but I'm also pretty sure transitioning to female isn't what I should do.

For a few years now I\'ve had some vague confusion relating to my gender identity. I\'m pretty sure that I\'m not a full-on trans girl, I don\'t (think) I experience dysphoria, although I know that it\'s possible to be one without it, and I am usually happy to present masculinely, even sometimes want to be more masculine. I don\'t think that\'s about fulfilling a societal expectation so much as just liking the idea of being big/strong/""manly"".\n\nThat being said I also sometimes (keyword sometimes) want to be a girl, basically. Cute, small, pretty. Of course it\'s possible to be those things while identifying as male but I think this goes a little beyond that. Like sometimes I\'ll see a woman on the street and kind of envy her, or want to have her body, whatever. I have no idea where that comes from. But again, sometimes I\'ll see a guy and ""wish"" I looked like him. It\'s a bit different, not envy usually so much as really liking/wanting to emulate a style or something, but I think that\'s mostly because I already have a male body.\n\nThis kind of extends into sex and relationships, too. I\'m bi, or at least identifying that way. Sometimes, I\'m a girl in my fantasies (it may or may not be worth noting these fantasies specifically usually have a bdsm element, where I\'m the sub) but in others I\'m basically who I am right now (and usually am the dom when it gets kinky). Obviously there\'s some patriarchy reflected in the kinky stuff, but I don\'t think that\'s at the root of my desires.\n\nI seem to like being masculine when I\'m involved with women and being feminine around guys. That\'s probably an internalization of some kind of straight cultural ideal, but it\'s the way it is. I dated this guy for a while, and sort of experimented with playing up my feminine side around him, (like I shaved my legs and wore women\'s t-shirts), and while I kind of enjoyed that, I wouldn\'t really want to do it around girls. I find myself most emotionally comfortable around girls as well. The only people I\'ve ever really been in love with were women, and most of my friends are as well. Dunno whether that means anything.\n\nBasically, what do you all think? I\'d appreciate advice from any perspective.

I was effeminant for a little boy many would comment family, teachers and class mates. I thought I was gay but I also like girls and them I decided I just liked whoever I liked and found bisexual to be the most fitting label for who I am attracted to physically or emotionally.

I decided to stop my period less than a week ago. I've wanted to not bleed for a long time, but last week something flipped in my brain.

I could actually do this.

I've had that happen a lot lately. I wanted to cut my hair, so I did. I wanted to bind, so I did. And now, I don't want periods, so I won't have them. It seems so simple to me in hindsight, but for years I said to myself *someday.* And I realized that either *someday* was today, or it never would be.

But my friend and I talked while we waited, and she said something like *Don't rush this and do something you'll regret or hurt yourself.* I had been talking about my (way way in the future) plans like sterilization or an IUD and chest surgery or low dose T. I only came out to her last week, and I told her I came out to my mom this weekend. I tried having a conversation about what I want with my mom two days after coming out to her, but she wasn't really receptive.

75,2017-09-15 16:33:18,70azgn,10,2,"All my life, I've walked around identifying as a straight, cis male.  I even fit the masculine bill - 27 years old, 5'10"", very strong and muscular at 255lbs, ex-military/war veteran with literal battle scars on my face and arms, large jaw and very broad shoulders, ""strong silent type"", etc.  I don't really care how I look, but I'm very happy with my body/appearance due to complex reasons rooted in childhood trauma.

I always have been and still am attracted to women exclusively and I recently came out as demisexual, but there's another thing I've been struggling with my entire life - I even remember struggling with it as a 4 or 5 year old.  When most people recall memories, they can easily see themselves in the memory.  They see their body with their face.  I don't, and I never have.  When I think back to old memories whether they're from yesterday or 20 years ago, I do not see myself.  In place of where I should be in my memories, I see a woman.  It's always a different one.  It could be a woman I know in my waking life or it could be a cartoon character.  The only constant is that the woman is always very attractive.  Even when I play video games, namely Mass Effect, I feel so much more at ease doing a playthrough as the female character and find myself resonating with them often.  Doing a playthrough as the male character feels annoying and I don't see myself in them at all.

Children often relate to or resonate with cartoon characters, storybook characters, etc.  Usually one that is like them or one that they want to be like someday.  I've always resonated with strong female characters.  To this day, I couldn't care less about the male characters and I always see myself in the strong female characters, especially if they're disciplined and independent.

Being called a man does not feel wrong, but it feels like there's something missing.  Being called a woman feels slightly better, but there's also still just something missing.  I have no preference whatsoever for pronouns, but I go with masculine ones since that's what I've always gone by.

I've been confused about this my entire life.  Even as a kid, I didn't understand what these feelings were.  I was always so confused watching Pokemon as a kid and just feeling more in tune with Misty or Officer Jenny (both strong, independent, female characters).  I never really looked too deeply into it until recently as an adult because I grew up in a rather conservative, Indian household where LGBTQ issues were often dismissed.

It could be a woman I know in my waking life or it could be a cartoon character.  The only constant is that the woman is always very attractive.  Even when I play video games, namely Mass Effect, I feel so much more at ease doing a playthrough as the female character and find myself resonating with them often.  Doing a playthrough as the male character feels annoying and I don\'t see myself in them at all.\n\nChildren often relate to or resonate with cartoon characters, storybook characters, etc.  Usually one that is like them or one that they want to be like someday.  I\'ve always resonated with strong female characters.  To this day, I couldn\'t care less about the male characters and I always see myself in the strong female characters, especially if they\'re disciplined and independent.\n\nBeing called a man does not feel wrong, but it feels like there\'s something missing.  Being called a woman feels slightly better, but there\'s also still just something missing.  I have no preference whatsoever for pronouns, but I go with masculine ones since that\'s what I\'ve always gone by.\n\nI\'ve been confused about this my entire life.  Even as a kid, I didn\'t understand what these feelings were.  I was always so confused watching Pokemon as a kid and just feeling more in tune with Misty or Officer Jenny (both strong, independent, female characters).  I never really looked too deeply into it until recently as an adult because I grew up in a rather conservative, Indian household where LGBTQ issues were often dismissed.\n\nCould I possibly be nonbinary?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""Not sure if I'm nonbinary or not.

I came out to my friends as nonbinary way back in April and it went well, they (almost) all use my pronouns and all that. But I've started experiencing a little bit of dysphoria around my name, Hazel. It's not a *really* feminine name, but it is almost always associated with women. 

My friends tend to call me Haze, or Haz which I appreciate since they sound a bit more gender neutral, but I don't think they would do as a legal name. I've considered Hayden instead, since it has the same first two letters, and the same number of syllables, plus it wouldn't be a drastic change for other people to get used to either. 

That said, I do have some attachment to my birthname.

I'm also not out to my parents and don't know if I ever will be, but I live with them so changing it so that letters and all that are addressed to a new name would be out of the question I think.

so as a child i was an EXTREME ""tom boy"" I wanted nothing to do with being a girl and all my friends were boys. I remember I would pray to god in the bathroom all the time that he'd change me into a boy.  In the 4th grade, PE was split up into boys and girls, and I was traumatized... I wanted to be with the boys, not the girls. I was forced to be with the girls, and the girls would ask me ""arent you a boy"" I was so pissed, that i was with the girls that I would fake being sick every time there was PE so I didnt have to go... And id ball my eyes out cause I hated it so much. 

from then on I dressed ""masculine"" up until high school, then I started dressing more feminine, just cause of society, what I saw on tv, whatever. I was comfortable dressing that way, but never acted fem, didn't ever wear make up, hated dresses but wore them occasionally. Ive hated dresses since birth. 

Sophomore year I figured out my sexuality and had my first girlfriend. now i label myself gay/lesbian. and I am fully accepting of that. 

some occurrences have happened where I feel like a ""man"" or not a woman per say... me and my girlfriend were talking about having kids, and everytime I think about carrying I feel sick like thats not supposed to happen to me, I usually refer to myself as being the ""dad"" jokingly. and say I need to go to ""daddy school"" to learn what to do with children. but i do feel that way like, im in a mans shoes in that situation. 

Im happy being a woman, Im happy with the way I look, I do not want to transition. But Ive always said I wouldn't mind doing it.  (open to it)

I still hate everything to do with being split up sex wise and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I do not like being categorized with other females. I definitely relate to men more, and they get along with me, almost like I really am not a girl. i do act/ portray more masculine. But I have a very fem face, and sometimes I do like my hail nails and make up done, and dressing fem. 

this is the most thought Ive ever put into this, so I just want to know if maybe im something different.

The thought of being the femme one in a relationship with a guy just makes no sense to me, either we're neutral vessels of egalitarianism or, in fact, I really really like boys with an obvious feminine side to them, too. I feel pretty inadequate and weak and girly compared to most guys, so I generally tend to avoid them and any romantic relations there, because it's all so heavily gender-role-coloured and I can't handle that. I want it either eradicated or slightly reversed.

I like girls, but I have stupid, stupid standards both when it comes to myself and potential partners. Chub, hairs, farts, the whole *oh my god, we're gross sacks of flesh that have human characteristics* aspect just completely fucks me over when it comes to girls. When I think about being with another girl, that's the only situation where I want to feel femininely beautiful and sexy.

The situation is kind of schizophrenic and every time I remember that issue (I drink, lift and study to forget.

Both of these ways of being and expressing myself are exclusive to the completely inappropriate genders, the thought of having it any other way just grosses me out though. I feel as if... those dynamics are essential to me. Besides the fucked up high standards when it comes to girls, all the aspects of wanting to be masculine or feminine or yearning to be loved and appreciated in a certain way have brought me joy. But I can't really be both. So it feels as if I have to... choose or decide something. It wouldn't be that way if I could just imagine myself as I am, with both guys and girls. But I can't. I could never present, act, express myself in a butch manner with another girl. And I could never throw myself at a guy while not expecting to be appreciated for strength, courage, musculature, confidence and a somewhat boyish aura.

The thing that's bothering me is I don't seem to be engaged in any sense of style (band t-shirts and jeans, woo), and while I'm now at the age where I should be dressing a bit more dapper/professional/less-slobby (30's), I feel like I'm being an impostor.I enjoy being a man and don't envision myself as a woman or transitioning, I just wish I wasn't ALWAYS presenting typical male.

In addition to this, I've noticed that my self-confidence has taken a hit lately. Much harder to make the most out of the day and it really takes effort to work on personal hygiene, though I generally feel great when I clean myself up. I just don't feel like my gender expression has ever really been *mine*. 

I live with my partner (f) and have hinted in times of distress that I don't feel great presenting as a typical ""man"". Her way of supporting me is letting me wear her earrings every now and then, which makes me feel great. I don't envision that I'd want to change too much about myself, maybe dye my hair a wacky colour, wear more effeminate earrings and nail polish maybe? I have a decent beard that I'm rather fond of. It's all very confusing.

I've been racking my brain trying to figure this out for a while. My biggest concerns are that I'm trying to enter the freelance professional world and I'm just not sure whether this is just fantasy. Could it be that the queer in me just wants to be free? I've been mostly stealth for years and I feel like I'd need to come out again. Is 30 too old to start messing with gender expression?

Hi, First of all let me say I do not have much experience with non binary issues but I respect everyone who identfies differently to binary.
I myself identify as hetrosexual male.
I am creating a new website business with a registration page that ony currently has male or female as an option https://heart-is.co.uk/register-now/
But I want to do better and have my new business be as inclusive as possible.
Can anyone point me in the direction of a good registration page that includes other options that I can steal a few ideas from.
I think Facebook has done some good work in this direction.

I know I want fat redistribution -- I want to be shaped like a man, but like a skinny man, and I wonder if I could get my desired shape sans hormones. I don't think I'm motivated to exercise &amp; diet hard enough for it though... I'm not overweight, just ~10-15 pounds over what I think would look better as a man. I do like my current femme shape, but just...not for me, yknow? 

I also like that my face is getting more masculine, but I think I look cuter as a girl, and I miss what I looked like with a girly hair cut :( Most of the time I prefer my boy cut, but sometimes I want a bob again. I can't see it looking good as a dude though...

I have mixed feelings about my voice changing -- I get very excited by the idea of having a low voice, but I also don't feel strong dysphoria about my voice now. I like how I sound! At the moment my range is getting wider &amp; my voice hasn't cracked.

I absolutely hate body hair, and it was only in recent years that my hair has gotten lighter and I've become less obsessed over it.

I'm really nervous about facial hair, I don't want it but I also don't want to immediately laser it, in case I change my mind and want a beard later. 

I'm fine with the bottom growth so far, it's been pretty subtle, and the more that changes the more I wish I had a dick (I don't particularly want phallo at this point in time though). And I never stop hating my boobs, top surgery is 100% in my future. 

Most days I feel more masc than femme, but on femme days I hate how I look with my short hair &amp; skirts, I look way more butch than I want to.

128,2017-09-25 05:39:42,72ahgs,3,6,"Hi friends, 
I guess I'm having some issues right now, mainly about my gender expression. I came to realization that I was non binary over the course of about two years. It was long and arduous but I have known solidly for about a year now that I am not cis, but agender. I have never felt a connection to any gender I have been presented with, and when I do feel a connection to something gender-related, it is a single aspect of a gender, not the gender as a whole.

So the way I dress changes wildly. I sometimes wear skirts, I sometimes wear slacks and a button up. Usually I dress pretty androgynously (think a short sleeved shirts and black jeans), but there is a noticeable shift sometimes, and I can't exactly explain why the shift happens. Some days I just want to wear a skirt, but other days I want to wear more masculine clothes. 

I always refer to myself gender-neutrally in my head, no matter how I dress, and I'm always most comfortable with they/them pronouns. I guess sometimes I just feel invalidated by dressing one way or another. Has anyone gone through this? Any advice on how to change those feelings or handle them? I guess I'm confused, I always thought agender fit but maybe it doesn't if I feel such a strong desire to present in these different ways? 
I appreciate any and all perspectives on this, I know no one can tell me what I am, but maybe hearing other stories could be helpful.

Yo!  So, I found /r/genderqueer almost two years ago, wondering what the hell I am and what to do.  I had this huge range of things, from cis man to transgender woman, and after two years of careful thought, a couple breakdowns, nerve-wracking trips to the women's section, and now after 6 months of HRT, I have narrowed it down to: Not male.

Now, I'm not hyperfocused on labels, (I'm hardly focused on anything right now due to this Monster I'm drinking, but I digress), but it would be nice to shrink the possible area down to something that I can say with confidence beyond Some Sort of Trans^TM\.

I *could* see a therapist, but I'd much rather talk to someone on my and their own time if I can.  If anyone is willing to reach out and has some experience in questioning, or has had a similar experience of identifying as cis-&gt;genderfluid-&gt;transfemale-&gt;agender-&gt;genderflux-&gt;transfeminine-&gt;fuckall, replies or PM's would be appreciated.

137,2017-09-27 17:50:34,72tzmp,5,1,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to put this.

Hello everyone! I'm a 25 year old AMAB and pretty much am 100% sure I'm not cisgender at this point; however, for the past year and after 2 counselors, I'm still questioning where on the trans spectrum I may be, and my previous interactions with trans community haven't gone well. After lurking here for about year, I figured I would run it by you fine people and any insight you could provide.

Background: 

Looking back now, there were signs that I was trans even when I was young: primarily being jealous of my sister's Barbies (they got me a Ken doll instead; although I did still love action figures--which are basically the same as dolls) and when we created our own Transmorgifier from Calvin &amp; Hobbes, I used it to make myself Brittany Spears. It wasn't until 5th grade that I actually became interested in women's clothes, after I noticed a girl in our class developed breasts and became fascinated by this: most of my early fantasies involved growing breasts or trading body parts, and that pretty much set the tone for most of my fantasies since. I started crossdressing and looking up trans and women's underwear online; I was caught a few times, and I would deny everything and passing it off as simple curiosity.

However, despite all this, I liked being a boy: hell, I like how I look with my goatee, which I dreamed for years of growing--I didn't like most of the boys in my classes and could relate to girls easier partially because I matured faster, but I never disliked myself for being a boy and I am comfortable being referred to as a man--I'm equally comfortable being called a woman, though if I were honest, I do feel satisfied when people call me a woman, but that may be because I've only just started considering myself a woman and it feels validating.

I have reached the point where I'm comfortable shopping for women clothes and heels (for the most part, and it was weird to see a pair of heels and desire them just because :)) and using female pronouns, and I will admit that once I put on thigh-highs and heels, I felt sexy--but at the same time, I'm okay with either smooth or hairy legs and I like my facial hair and my genitals (even if I think dicks are kind of ugly XD).

Ultimately, I just wind up feeling like a man and woman simultaneously and feel just as comfortable with fake breasts on and off, if that makes sense.

TLDR: basically, given my history, I know I'm trans, but since I like both my male and female selves, I'm not sure if I should consider transitioning or not: my ideal would be to magically be able to switch whenever I wanted, but I'm not sure if it's because being male is what I'm used to or which one I'd want to present as primarily.

141,2017-09-28 04:38:44,72xvuq,11,8,"Hi everyone!

I'm kind of in the weird position that when I come out to people, I don't really know what to come out as. I feel like I can't really say I'm ftm, because I don't identify 100% as a man, but I can't say I'm nonbinary either, because I identify too much as a guy for that (and 0% as a woman) in my opinion. I am kind of sure of my 'spot' on the gender spectrum by the way, but I don't really feel like explaining all of that to everyone all the time. 

So basically, if I have to 'choose' between man and woman, I would definitely say I'm a man. When I have to choose between man, woman and non-binary, I'm stuck between man and non-binary (this was really difficult when I signed up for Quidditch, lol). When I have to pick a spot on a spectrum I know it's somewhere around 50% a guy and 50% nothing. 

Sometimes I do think there's something withholding me from identifying as ftm, namely that I feel like I'm not 'manly' enough for saying I'm a man. Vice versa, when I say I'm non-binary, I feel like people are not going to take me seriously, or think partly of me as a woman.

I do have some solutions for this. When coming out to people, I usually say I don't feel like a woman, and more like a man. Or I just say I'm trans. In both cases most people probably assume I'm ftm, but I don't really mind that. 

I'm aware of labels that kind of describe me, like transmasculine non-binary and demiboy, but if I come out as one of those, I'll have to do a lot of explaining. 

So basically this isn't the biggest problem in the world, but I wondered if there are more people in the same position. If so, how do you handle all of this?

Currently, my best friend is finally getting to start her transition from male to female! She has been on hormones for about 6 weeks now and is the happiest I have ever seen her! We have been friends since I was 12 (Im 25 now). I was with her when she first discovered she was SHE and not HE, She was there when I discovered I was bi-sexual, and I was with her when she thought maybe she wasn't trans, (We both grew up semi-brainwashed by the church as our families where heavily involved in the scene), then there for her to celebrate of course when she realized and fully embraced the she WAS Katy!!! 

I have an unending amount of emotional and vocal support for her, however I suck at being a girl as I am fairly androgynous and that is where I need YOUR help.

I want to buy her first pair of shoes for her upcoming birthday, I have no idea where to start there :( I am worried that asking to measure her feet will offend her as they are a sore subject for her. I think he feet are lovely but she still feels like they are too masculine. How can I get the proper shoe size for her, in the most caring way? I am thinking about getting her a nice pair of black boots, is there anything else I should know when buying shoes for someone transitioning to female? I want everything to be perfect for her, i want her to just slip the shoe right on and have if fit like it should, I dont want her to worry about returning it because it is too small, as that would make her feel bad, as it has in the past?

Do you have any tips for me for buying clothing for her also? I want to make her happy and I want to support her the best way I can.

A year ago, I was with a girl that loved the idea of me more than she loved the reality, and I had to make some tough choices about our relationship. I haven't spoken to her since Christmas day.

A year ago, I thought this might make my mother and I closer and fix our broken relationship. Instead I have a restraining order against her and a new scar on my forearm. Today, as far as my parents are concerned, I'm an orphan.

A year ago, I was scared that I would have to go through this journey alone, or with friends too busy to spend time with me, or too far away. I thought that dating would be difficult. The truth is that the weak weed themselves out (or so I told myself), and I drew the lottery and found the perfect person for me, and she and I have since become engaged and had a private handfasting.

A year ago I struggles with clothes and makeup. Today I put one makeup with ease and all of my clothes make me SO happy.

A year ago I legitimately questioned my ability to survive. Now I do not. I know how resilient I am.

29,2017-09-12 21:53:41,6zq8t1,6,14,"I like guys and sex has always been a very important part of my life. I let my desire to be the opposite sex out in my sexual fantasies since I was 11 or 12. I always wanted to be a girl in the bedroom with a guy. Guy on guy never turned me on because I could never picture myself as a guy. 

There is one strong sign of gender dysphoria that has been present since age 4: I have always been convinced that my thoughts and feelings are the thoughts and feelings of the opposite sex and I have always been convinced that what I felt is what the opposite sex feels. 

Another potential sign of strong gender dysphoria: I dream of taking a karyotype test where they discover that I was born with female genetics ( intersex ). 

In my mind and when reading a book or watching  television series I always identified with characters of the opposite sex. 

The conviction that I have the soul of a woman in a male body has always been present. 

As long as I can remember I felt negative or indifferent towards my penis. When I started watching transgender porn I never liked that the trans girl her penis was showing. I always look for videos where her penis is hidden. As soon as her penis pops up I feel alienated from her. I also don't like letting sexual partners play with my genitalia, I would even cry if someone touched them.

Crossdreaming has occured since as long as I can remember. Dreaming of being the opposite sex in everyday situations etc...

I am very offended by homophobia though. I don't know why. Sometimes I wonder if I could be a gay male myself and just be deeply in denial. There are a few things that contradict this: I can't portray myself as a man with another man. It doesn't arouse me and I can't relate whereas with woman plus man I get aroused and feel recognition instantly. 

I don't know if this can be considered dysphoria but facial hair and body hair freak me out. So does having a male body odor because I prefer smelling feminine. 

I internalized a lot of mysogynistic views. I don't want to socially transition because I can have a better career as a man, easier time expressing my opinion etc...

I'm very scared to grow old as a male. I could accept growing old as a woman. 

I can't shake the thought that I might be a gay male deeply in denial. 

I saw a general physician who prescribed me hormones.

Good and bad sides of hormone replacement therapy:

- I like having soft skin
- I like smelling feminine
- I love having softened facial features
- I enjoy the feminine sex drive and orgasms more

Bad:

- I have anxiety attacks since I started HRT
- My breasts have grown too big for my comfort. I like them but I wish they were smaller
- I don't have a lot of energy 
- I have gotten my first episode of dissociation since HRT

Good sides of stopping hormones:

- My life wasn't too bad before I embarked on this journey. I just didn't like having a male appearence. If I stopped HRT I would probably go back to a moderate life with a nagging feeling. Especially now that I tasted femininity.
- The anxiety attacks might stop
- I don't know if the dissociation would stop but it might.

Bad sides of stopping hormones:

- I like my appearence and I would be sad if my facial features sharpened again.
- I would hate morning wood coming back
- There would always be a strong envy towards people with a feminine appearence.
- I would hate if my thought pattern became more masculine again.
- I wouldn't like growing old as a man.
- I feel envy of poster child trans women.


Something strange that could point towards gender dysphoria:

- I secretely wish that I found signs that pointed to me being trans. Not sure if that means something?


I keep wondering if I'm transitioning to be the woman in a heterosexual relationship, I can't shake the thought that I'm transitioning driven by a sexual force.

If I found out that I wasn't trans I would be crushed because my whole life I have been convinced that I was feeling like a girl and the desire to be a girl has always been there. Reading articles that suggest that I might be a cis male end in anxiety attacks: I just can't imagine myself as a male. 

I'm just scared because I read everywhere that if your brain sex is male and you take MtF HRT you will get all kinds of negative side effects on your mind. I don't like to read stuff like that because it feels invalidating and the thought that I might not be trans horrifies me.

First step is to probably tell my family. I live with my sisters my mother lives nearby and my father passed away (at least I won’t have to see his reaction(that was horrible I know)). It would probably be weird if I just started looking different with no explanation. \n\nFor y’all who have went through anything similar to this, how did you go about it?

50,2017-09-17 22:56:02,70qwwo,5,23,"Excuse the wall of text, and thank you to the ones who actually read through it.

I grew up in an ultra conservative household, where being gay was a choice, and being trans was kind of a fetish. Strangely enough, my father in his 20s used to cross dress as a way to distance himself from the trauma he had experienced with his mother, and my mother has never really had strong feminine feelings either. My mother wore what was practical, over what was cute, and I was told that what I wanted didn't matter. So I never really developed a style. I just kind of did what I was told.

At 12, I hit puberty hard, and  I didn't want to wear bras, I didn't want to learn how to shave my legs and underarms. It just felt like I didn't need to. Like I wasn't supposed to. My mother never took the effort to teach us makeup, or how to be lady like. My father in his own depression and suppression of his trauma started hitting me.

At 15 I had my first feelings for a girl. She was straight, and didn't like me, but I treated her like my girlfriend anyway, and pretended I was in a cis relationship in the back of my head, even if I couldn't admit my own feelings for her. I knew the other girls in my class thought we were a gay couple, based on the way we acted, her sitting on my lap sometimes, and how I would jokingly call her my wife. Ultimately I think she was bi in denial as her parents were staunchly mormon, and being gay was a sin, and she told me we couldn't do those things anymore.

At 16 I met my current boyfriend of 3 years. At that point, had started questioning my gender, due to the religious compulsion I had to watch people like Ty turner, or chase. I watched transition video after transition video. I was beginning to wonder ""Do I identify with this? Or am I just fascinated with these people?"" 

At 17 I decided I was Nonbinary, in hopes that I could still half ass identify as a girl, and be more masculine. I started buying men's clothes. My bf was more than accepting... but I knew he was straight and transitioning would be a bad idea.

Now at 18, I am sitting in my bathtub... staring at my body, and trying to convince myself once again, that I am not a guy. That I'm not supposed to hate my chest, and that my hips are actually something to be desired. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not feeling dysphoria, even as I am sitting here, loathing the way my body looks.

I keep telling myself it's my parents fault. My parents just didn't teach me how to be a girl, or tried to force me into a rigid stereotype of a girl later, because wearing men's clothes wasn't cool. But I want to be a dude. Maybe it's because I was abused. I want to be a man because I won't feel as weak... No, it's because I have an outsider complex, and have never really felt like I fit. It's me trying to fit somewhere, and just grasping at straws... I'm just bi, and that part I was playing with that girl wasn't because I felt more comfortable being a man in my relationship, I'm just a butch bi girl. So many excuses. I couldn't transition because I love this guy, and hes straight. He would stop loving me. So many reasons I am like this but I shouldn't transition...

From the tree of despair.

And on my long climb up,

Could see more clearly there.

The view from above,

On that tree’s swollen limbs,

Showed me more than was needed

To dissolve all my sins.

&amp;nbsp;

So I shouted from atop,

“I don’t want to die!”

And when the echoes stopped,

And in the blink of an eye,

&amp;nbsp;

The branch beneath me gave…

&amp;nbsp;

And with the rope like a necklace,

(Now more like a grave)

I reached out for footing,

And found myself saved.

&amp;nbsp;

When I finally stopped shaking,

I descended back down.

I am ready to try,

I am ready right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Still I keep that rope hung,

For my own way to say:

“I’m not ready to die.

Not back then, not today.”

I'm 15, assigned male, and live + was born in the UK. I started wondering whether I was trans a year and a half ago, and since then a lot has happened; I've considered myself trans for about six months, but that time hasn't been the best, so I'm trying to reconsider.

I've had little hints or inklings that are obvious 'egg' signs from when I was a little kid, before I knew anything about this whole thing, where I liked to (and still do) consider myself a girl or act/pretend to be one. I pretended for a full year to be a girl online (i'm ashamed of that but i might as well say it here anonymously) before I knew anything and I felt more 'at home' I guess? I don't know how to describe the whole thing.

After I started to consider myself a girl, I've been really uncomfortable about my body and looks, and my mental health hasn't been doing that well either. I could list everything but it would be a waste of space

I'm afraid of transitioning, I'm afraid I'll never pass, some days i don't get dysphoria and i don't know what that means, I'm afraid i'm too late in life, I go to an all-male school. I came out to my parents when I first realised, after my poor mental health started showing up more prominently, and they said 'it might be just a phase, don't commit to anything now' and i can't say anything to them about it without them saying it's a phase.

The thing is it might be a phase, i want it to be a phase, i want it to go away. I don't know what my steps are or how long i'll have to wait and I'm so scared of it being pointless.

I'm not smart enough to know what to do here, i'm so sorry if it would have been better to post somewhere else, I just wanted to get this out there and hope someone who sees this can help. Any help is appreciated no matter what but i'm sorry if i wasted your time

I came out to my parents when I first realised, after my poor mental health started showing up more prominently, and they said 'it might be just a phase, don't commit to anything now' and i can't say anything to them about it without them saying it's a phase.\n\nThe thing is it might be a phase, i want it to be a phase, i want it to go away. I don't know what my steps are or how long i'll have to wait and I'm so scared of it being pointless.\n\nI'm not smart enough to know what to do here, i'm so sorry if it would have been better to post somewhere else, I just wanted to get this out there and hope someone who sees this can help. Any help is appreciated no matter what but i'm sorry if i wasted your time\n\nTL;DR - AMAB 15 y/o, (what i think is) gender euphoria as a girl and dysphoria as a boy, mental health problems, 'just a phase' parents and live in the UK so will probably use the NHS if i do.

The problem and address to the title are that if I ever did represent myself as another sex, I would never be satisfied with it, I would never feel authentically my true nature due to my physical limitations.

A little bit about me: I'm AMAB and pre-everything, but when everything's said and done, I definitely want to be perceived as female. No doubt about that. But I don't know what it ""feels like"" to be male, female, or anything else. While I've pretty much always wished that I had been born a girl, I wouldn't necessarily say that I ""feel like a girl."" It's just that I'm incredibly uncomfortable being perceived as and treated like a guy. And while I would be so much happier if I had been assigned female at birth, I'm not sure if I'd be *totally* comfortable with that assignment, either. It's like the difference between a pair of shoes that's five sizes too small versus a pair that's one size too big. One's definitely more comfortable than the other, but that doesn't make it a perfect fit. And maybe I'll ""grow into these new shoes"" after I officially come out to everyone. Or change my wardrobe. Or change my name and/or pronouns. Or start HRT. Maybe it's just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a binary trans woman. But it may also be just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a femme non-binary person. I'm honestly not sure.

I also wonder if I'm hesitating to call myself a trans woman due to some form of internalized gatekeeping. The way I've explain it to some of my friends, calling myself a woman and using she/her pronouns feels a bit like calling myself a dancer; I'm definitely not ""not a dancer"" (because I do love to dance), but I certainly don't have the years of training and experience that seems to be the prerequisite for calling oneself a dancer. And I know that trans people are the gender they say they are and have every right to refer to themselves as such! But while I believe that wholeheartedly when it comes to other trans people, it's a lot harder to accept that truth for myself. (Or maybe I hesitate to call myself a trans woman because I'm not? It's all very confusing.)

So I'm looking to hear about what being non-binary means to the people on this subreddit. Maybe hearing other people's explanations can help me get a little bit closer to figuring myself out. (And if you feel so inclined to analyse what I've said about myself and provide your own opinion as to what my gender may be, please feel free to do so. Obviously, I'm the only one who can decide who I am, but sometimes it helps to get an outside opinion. :))",genderqueer,Binary/Non-Binary?

47,2017-09-11 05:07:16,6zddm2,6,9,"So I have an issue that I'm struggling with and could use some input from members of the genderqueer community. I apologize for the length.

I am a woman (although I guess I have questioned whether I should identify as genderqueer in the past because I have a personal pull toward masculinity, but I settled on identifying as a woman with a masculine side) who has predominantly been intimate with straight men. (I'm attracted to AMAB bodies, and that just kind of is what it is.) I've always known that I'm really attracted to fem guys, even more so, ironically, than some of my gay male friends. I wound up in a LTR with a straight guy who was kind of small and slim and not hypermasculine, but recently we opened the relationship for reasons that included a lackluster sex life and flagging attraction. I'm not really into being penetrated and I prefer being the penetrator during sex.

During this open period, I met someone I fell in love with. I was really attracted to him first off because he had a vibe that felt feminine even though he was in other respects a muscular dude with a beard. He was sweet and soft and gentle in his mannerisms and voice and flirted in a way that was unlike any straight man I had ever been with before or after my opening of the relationship I am in. He came out to me as genderqueer on our second date and I wasn't particularly surprised. The way we were intimate was different than any other time I have had sex--I did not have to explain my desire to be penetrative or the top to him, and aspects of the way he reacted or simply was in bed were, without being too explicit, not like heterosexual men I've been with.  It was a kind of intimacy that I realized I had always craved. 

Long story short, we didn't date for very long because I am for unavoidable reasons leaving the country for a period of time that is too long for him to want to commit to being in a LDR. As a result of that relationship, I wound up questioning some fundamental things about my sexuality and what I need in a relationship.

I had a conversation with a bisexual man where he told me that ""queer sex is queer"" and there is some understanding of the fluidity of what are understood as gender ""roles"" in the heterosexual context. Putting aside the issue of love, which I also feel for my ex, I was strongly sexually attracted to his masculine-bodied mixture of femininity and masculinity and ""receptive"" sexuality, which meshed with my own. I am thinking about seeking out partners who are specifically genderqueer (or otherwise gender variant), AMAB and like being with a woman who is penetrative/a top. I've found some threads in this subreddit that do seem to suggest that this might mesh with the desires of some people in this community. I guess I feel like hearing what the experiences with love and finding compatible partners has been for people in this community, or what people think about others who may or may not be genderqueer themselves feeling attracted to the traits of genderqueer people or desiring a queer sexuality that is divorced from expectations created by gender presentation or assigned sex. Writing this post is part of my process for dealing with this breakup, so I hope you can excuse these impertinent questions.

I almost lost my long term commited relationship when I told my partner I bought a binder. We'd discussed it before and he said it would be a deal breaker.

I wasn't sure what I was hoping for when it arrived and I wore it. I both wanted to feel wearing it would be ""whatever, it's not for me."" as badly as I wanted wearing it to feel ""right"". 

I'm still questioning myself and my feelings. I was so amazed at how I looked with a flat chest. I kept texting one of my two supportive friends ""OMG it's so flat!!!! :D"" She asked for a photo and said I looked SO HAPPY.

I decided that for now, I accept my breasts being like size AA and that my partner wants my body to be female. He's heterosexual, not gay or bisexual, he said. He said I shouldn't try because I'm not tormented with gender identity confusion ""every fucking day"" but only periodically.

I don't think I want a flat chest all the time either.

Months ago I decided to stop hrt MTF,actually I posted my experience here.

The situation is that I was super fine and calmed,I was happy for feeling like myself over again,I mean,as a guy,that guy that I missed and wanted to be so bad again as soon as I started hrt,but...

The main problem is that now,people are telling me that I will regret the fact of having stopped hrt,since the moment I decided to stop it,it's all I hear,you'll regret it,you'll end up taking hormones in a future and those comments make me feel so damn anxious. It's true that (recently) I've thought about what if I had not stopped hrt....the other bad part is that most of the times when I feel anxiety, sadness, loneliness or when I feel the pressure of life like going through tough situations I always think it'd be easier if I were a woman...I always found women to be happier, like they have the freedom to be themselves and be happy. 

I feel a lot of pressure from society about what they want me to be as a man,so if I don't fit in ""men's"" standards I feel like I'd be happier as a woman....men all the time have to be super masculine and women can be the way the want to...

One day I feel 100% sure about being myself (guy) and feeling great but when I'm in bad situations or feeling pressure to be super masculine (thing I don't like)  I'd love to be a woman....what do you guys think that

111,2017-09-27 18:00:46,72u25q,6,1,"Hello everyone! I'm a 25 year old AMAB and pretty much am 100% sure I'm not cisgender at this point; however, for the past year and after 2 counselors, I'm still questioning where on the trans spectrum I may be, and my previous interactions with trans community haven't gone well. After lurking here for about year, I figured I would run it by you fine people and any insight you could provide.

Background: 

Looking back now, there were signs that I was trans even when I was young: primarily being jealous of my sister's Barbies (they got me a Ken doll instead; although I did still love action figures--which are basically the same as dolls) and when we created our own Transmorgifier from Calvin &amp; Hobbes, I used it to make myself Brittany Spears. It wasn't until 5th grade that I actually became interested in women's clothes, after I noticed a girl in our class developed breasts and became fascinated by this: most of my early fantasies involved growing breasts or trading body parts, and that pretty much set the tone for most of my fantasies since. I started crossdressing and looking up trans and women's underwear online; I was caught a few times, and I would deny everything and passing it off as simple curiosity.

However, despite all this, I liked being a boy: hell, I like how I look with my goatee, which I dreamed for years of growing--I didn't like most of the boys in my classes and could relate to girls easier partially because I matured faster, but I never disliked myself for being a boy and I am comfortable being referred to as a man--I'm equally comfortable being called a woman, though if I were honest, I do feel satisfied when people call me a woman, but that may be because I've only just started considering myself a woman and it feels validating.

I have reached the point where I'm comfortable shopping for women clothes and heels (for the most part, and it was weird to see a pair of heels and desire them just because :)) and using female pronouns, and I will admit that once I put on thigh-highs and heels, I felt sexy--but at the same time, I'm okay with either smooth or hairy legs and I like my facial hair and my genitals (even if I think dicks are kind of ugly XD).
Ultimately, I just wind up feeling like a man and woman simultaneously and feel just as comfortable with fake breasts on and off, if that makes sense.

TLDR: basically, given my history, I know I'm trans, but since I like both my male and female selves, I'm not sure if I should consider transitioning or not: my ideal would be to magically be able to switch whenever I wanted, but I'm not sure if it's because being male is what I'm used to or which one I'd want to present as primarily.

112,2017-09-27 18:05:17,72u3dc,4,49,"I have been exploring my gender for a few years, and while I'm still not totally used to the term, I've started labeling myself ""demi gendered."" For me, this means that I am totally comfortable identifying and expressing as a cis man, but I also drift into a non-binary area a lot of the time. My typical style combines menswear with the masculine side of women's clothes (button-downs; pixie pants; simple/subtle belts and watches…). I get a lot more adventurous for my Instagram (not linked to preserve semi-anonymity for this acct.), and I have even worn a fairly short skirt in public once. I also always have my hand-me-down purple Coach shoulder bag.

**Take encouragement, all who are nervous about expressing themselves in ways that don't fit societal norms:** I have almost never faced negative reactions in public, even in a conservative-leaning city. In fact, that one time I wore a skirt out on the street, I got compliments from a few strangers—and I never shave my beard; I was clearly a man in a skirt.

Despite my overwhelmingly neutral treatment, I am still often self-conscious when walking in public with not-totally-masculine attire. Just a couple weeks ago, I was walking home while presenting entirely masculine except for my purse, which I wear across my shoulder like a messenger bag. I was imagining telling someone about the one time I had faced slight push-back for my gender exploration (a lot of my thoughts take place as kind of practice conversations).

The incident took place in one of our local Dillards stores. The layout has all the men's clothing on one level and all the women's downstairs. I was poking through the skirts and found a few I wanted to try on. I was definitely not going to take the escalator up to find the men's fitting rooms, so I walked toward the ones by the bras and sleepwear.

**PRO TIP: Always act like you belong where you are.** You don't need to have a chip on your shoulder, but never apologize with your body language. I have tried on women's clothes in Target, JCPenney, Ross, Shopko, Nordstrom, every shop in the malls... With the exception of this one time, the changing room staff have never batted an eye. (Actually, JCP often doesn't have anyone staffing the changing rooms, so if you're especially self-conscious, you might try there first)

Anyway, I was walking purposefully toward the dressing area when I heard from behind me a panicked ""Sir? Sir??"" I sighed to myself, but kept my head high as I turned to see a female attendant, middle-aged or maybe a bit older, urgently making her way toward me. ""You can't go in there,"" she said emphatically, but trying to keep her composure, ""Those are the women's rooms.""

I can understand protecting women's privacy and safety, but it's worth noting here that the rooms were not stalls divided by bathroom-like partitions with big gaps at the bottom; nor did they have curtains, like at H&amp;amp;M (whose dressing rooms are co-ed, incidentally). Dillards is a semi-fancy outlet, and their dressing rooms have full doors with locks.

I told the woman that I just wanted to try on a few things and showed her my skirts. She was obviously taken aback, and called over another employee—a supervisor, I think—for advice. She explained the situation half under her breath to her superior, ""He wants to try on some… skirts.""

The other woman, younger, but with the self possession of a manager, was totally unfazed. ""That's alright. He can do that."" So I did. The attendant was still flustered and confused, but just kind of shuffled off to reorganize a rack somewhere. It was a very tame experience (for me; that lady was shaken by it, I guess) and it goes to show that if you project calm, shopkeepers are rarely going to give you much grief; they're professionals. That was the ""half"" time I was harassed.

I was thinking about all of that, and how lucky I have been, as I walked on the sidewalk. I always feel in the back of my mind that there's another shoe that's waiting to drop, and somebody's going to call me out or accost me. There's also a feeling like I don't deserve to be part of the queer community because I have lived my life with all of the straight-cis-male privilege (I'm actually ostensibly pan, but that's another conversation) and have never been made to feel unsafe or unwelcome because of my identity. 

Just as I stepped onto the grass to walk around to the front of the house, a car drove by behind me and I heard someone yell ""Fucking f****t!"" and I thought ""There it is. I can check that off."" They kept driving, and I kept walking.

I haven't had a chance since then to dress femme in public, but my hope is that the pressure is less now. Sometimes a negative experience can validate all the other, positive experiences. There are far too many instances, nationwide, of people being beaten or killed for their identities, and I will fully admit that I have grown up with immense social privilege (even ignoring the somewhat controversial idea of ""passing privilege"").

I start a new job soon.

So I've been dealing with this for a while. A big part of why the genderqueer/genderfluid/non-binary labels are comfortable for me is that my dysphoria tends to fluctuate and is rarely extremely severe. I've never had a firm conviction that I'm a man, and even at my worst, I can live with my body.

Over the years, I feel like I've come to accept my body a little more on an objective level. I'm pretty pleased with how it looks. If I look at myself in the mirror, I'll think that my curves look good. From certain angles, my breasts look nice.

But the thing is, even in the best times, I feel kind of distanced from my body. It's like I'm a girl who's gone into puberty over the summer and still hasn't gotten used to it or, well, like I'm a guy in a woman's body. It's ""fine."" I don't hate it. But if I focus on it too much, I become more dysphoric. And sometimes I feel such a longing for a more masculine body. Being attracted to men (I'm bisexual) honestly hurts because I get so jealous of men I think are attractive.

So on the one hand, the idea of starting HRT and/or having top surgery is a little daunting. I don't always feel sure. I worry about missing aspects of how I look now, or feeling like I've ""ruined"" my body. And I want to acknowledge the possibility that the trade-offs of transitioning may not be worth it for me and weigh that out.

On the other hand, I often feel like I'm settling or trying to compensate. I go through periods where I latch onto any neutral or positive feelings I have about my body and try to ward off my dysphoria with optimism, and it just doesn't work. Sometimes I feel like I play up the negatives of transitioning because I find it daunting. Sometimes I feel like I ""should"" be able to be happy with my body and assigned gender, or that I should be able to choose to do this. I actually took a break from Reddit and watching trans-related YouTube videos because hearing people describe trying to bury their feelings but ultimately accepting that they needed to transition was hitting a little close to home and I didn't want to admit it. 

So it's hard to know what feelings to prioritize. I don't want to go through a process that I might not like or ""need,"" but I also don't want to cheat myself out of possibly having a body I feel more at home in.

I'd like to start talking to a therapist. My dysphoria in the last month has been far worse than it ever has before - so much so that I don't think I can just ignore it anymore. I'm trying to find one with nonbinary awareness, but I don't even know if I am NB... I'm really scared to talk to someone who isn't going to understand or be able to help.

I'm AMAB, but definitely not male. As far as I can tell, I identify as a girl-child. This doesn't really even make sense to me, since I would think that girl-child and boy-child would be the same, but I definitely only ever think girl, not boy. 

Random thoughts:

* My ideal self has no secondary sex characteristics.

* In my dreams and fantasies I'm usually a child (usually feminine - almost always dresses and long hair). Not in school or anything, just the body of a child and normal dream/fantasy stuff (including mundane everyday life). 

* My main sources of physical dysphoria are: body hair, facial structure and shoulders. 

* I'm tall for a male, and while I worry that it would make it difficult to pass as a girl, it doesn't actually cause me dysphoria. (That said, I do imagine myself as a child - short.)

* I don't find my penis to be a source of dysphoria. (Though I'm also not really that attached to it - if I were to transition, I would probably get SRS as well.)

* My father has accidentally called me his daughter twice - and it makes me incredibly happy (the second time was earlier this year).

* I'm 31 and don't have any ingrained social fears or anything/have no desire to actually be a child. When the hypothetical ""what would I do if I suddenly woke up as a child"" question comes up, I usually just think of how dreadful it would be. When I consider being a girl though, the question becomes less dreadful and is actually fun to ponder what school/life would be like growing up, but not necessarily a desire to actually go through it.

* I have a strong libido, but I think I would be happier with none/no awareness of sex. (When I think of my ""ideal"" self, I never think about sexual relationships (though I do imagine having a partner to talk to/share life with/cuddle and relax with).)

* I can't imagine the future as a man. 

* I can't imagine the future as a woman.

* The dysphoria changes - some weeks I don't think about it that much and don't have any issues, then other weeks its crippling.

* I really don't want breasts - I could maybe see small ones ('A' cup at the absolute max) as being fun but I'm terrified that I would have larger ones (probably true based on close family) --- this is the main reason that I've never started transitioning.

123,2017-09-29 14:46:12,73894b,3,5,"Hi guys, 
I am a 24 yr old AFAB genderqueer fellow. I have a top surgery date approaching in about 2 months and I am internally freaking out. I am still under my mother's insurance which has coverage for surgery even though I'm not on T. However, a few months ago I found out her insurance will be changing very soon, and since then I have been scrambling to figure out if I should pursue surgery (an opportunity to have this much coverage may not come around again for years... I am not even sure if I will ever go on T).


 I am feeling really stuck and anxious lately. I keep shifting between feeling certainty/excitement, doubt/anxiety, and then often experiencing apathy towards everything (which is not unusual for me in my daily life). I don't know why this is so hard for me. I think I have an overwhelming fear of regret, and the permanence of it all. I have literally been obsessing about this every day since I found out about the insurance change and have been taking steps since then to get closer to surgery i.e. saw a gender therapist who wrote me a letter after our 3rd meeting, dealing with my insurance a lot, had my consultation with the surgeon, already planned surgery date (December 13th because mother's insurance ends January 1st)



I am feeling very helpless in this situation. I have been binding for 5 years without pause (i wear it all the time, even during sex. Never take it off unless I'm showering or sometimes sleeping-- I know it is unhealthy) so I would think this would be relieving, but it is giving me so much anxiety. I am afraid that I won't be able to deal with the consequences of the surgery and how I might view myself (I have a lot of internalized shame that I think stems from childhood). I am also worried that I will realize I should have just gotten a breast reduction. I am larger chested so sometimes I wonder if I had just been born with a small A cup, if that would've made me happy. This has been my newest obsession, wondering if top surgery is too extreme and I should just have a breast reduction. But I am also terrified of how I might feel if I don't have this surgery and miss that deadline. I envision myself with a smaller chest, and sometimes it seems more relieving but other times it seems not enough. The same thing with a completely flat chest-- sometimes seems relieving and other times I feel like it's maybe too drastic?



Either way, I am afraid of feeling suicidal with the result. Either doing the surgery and somehow regretting it (even though I never use my boobs for anything so that seems irrational... but I guess fear of doing it and feeling like it still isn't me or like there isn't any body that would make me feel fully comfortable. I guess more afraid of how I will view myself and how others will view me and that I might just dissociate more). Or not doing the surgery and then feeling horrible about myself and absolutely stuck until I maybe have a similar opportunity years from now (the thought of missing the opportunity sometimes makes me want to crawl out of my skin).



Sorry for the rant guys, I guess I'm just looking for clarity. I think being genderqueer doesn't necessarily make the decision easier. I am afraid of being perceived as a halfway transition or feeling incomplete (sorry, not meant to offend anyone... these are inward feelings only). Even though I know I don't feel like any gender really, and whatever will make me look most androgynous would probably make me happiest. 



I need to make the best decision for myself, I can deal with the consequences later. I just don't know what the best decision is and I'm beginning to feel pretty hopeless.




If some background is helpful:
-Binding for 5 years (never remove it, only showering and sleep)
-Feel extreme chest dysphoria in intimate settings or will revert to apathy
-Been going by he/him pronouns for over a year
-Came out as genderqueer 5 years ago
-Legally changed my name over 2 years ago
(Essentially have been making a slow progression of transition for the past 5 years)


So, what would you do if you were me? It seems like everyone in my life seems more certain that this would make me happy than I do. I can never seem to move past my doubts...

I've already thought this to death, but if anyone has a perspective or exercise they think might get me closer to clarity, I'd love to hear it.

124,2017-09-29 17:38:18,739enc,1,4,"This is probably not going to make a lot of sense, but I'll do my best. I've been opting to identify as genderqueer for a few years now, in an attempt to combat the confusion and stress that I feel whenever I try and think about my gender. The trouble is, I feel like I'm battling two different strands whenever I consider it. Whether it's a true transgender, gender dysphoria, or whether I'm perfectly happy the way that I am. I was born female, for context.

As a kid I know I always fantasized about being male. I would play make believe as a man, in gay relationships, with a friend of mine almost constantly. I never pretended to be a fully grown adult woman. As I aged I never really grew out of it, but I grew into womanhood. 

I'm 19 now. I'm not uncomfortable in my body most of the time. My boobs a bit too big for my liking, but in my defense they're fucking huge. And I'm not quite a fan of vaginas - even my own. Despite that I'm not unhappy, I think, as a woman. I dress up sometimes, though I'm not much of a skirt/dress person. I love shirts that show off my cleavage. That sort of thing.

I am afab and questioning my gender, but I currently feel most comfortable posting in genderqueer because that seems to fit best at the moment.
Anyway, so I noticed a pattern in my life (before questioning) that the guys who liked me, or ones I've dated, were definitely leaning a little more to the feminine side, and honestly I would NOT be surprised if one or more came out as gay (or trans) at some point.

So my current bf is no exception to this (I don't even do this on purpose, I swear.) We haven't talked much about my gender identity but I brought it up today and he said he was open to talking about it and would like to better understand. 

Anyway, most of our friendship, and now, relationship I have identified as a cis-girl. And at one point I had started to question his sexuality (not to his face but I do slide in some questions here and there like ""would you ever ____ with a guy"". and so on). He seems to be somewhat open to the idea and in my opinion has more of an attraction to guys than he may realize. (I only say this because he does comment on men's looks quite a bit)
 I won't go into too much detail, but mostly mannerisms and comments here and there from him have caused me to question his sexuality.
(please note that I know that these things don't define people's sexualities, but trust that I have spent enough time with him and many gay people to have a good ""radar"" if you will for these things) 

sidenote: I frequent the FTM pages on here as well as I'm still figuring what gender suits me best... and I read some stories about pre-out, pre-transition, trans men who dated guys, whom later turned out to be gay. which, makes a lot of sense. 

and here lies my question. Are there any openly genderqueer people who are dating men who identify as gay? does that even work? lol specifically afab people? Although amab would be relevant as well.

Since coming out as non-binary about a year ago, I've been working really hard on transitioning my appearance to be more androgynous.  At this point I'm wearing pretty much exclusively ""women's"" clothing (though generally with a more androgynous bent) and earrings, painting my nails, shaving my legs, etc.  Though I'm much more comfortable with my appearance and identity now than I ever was when presenting/identifying as cis male, I still feel a lot of dysphoria about my body, especially with regard to distribution of fat around my abdomen (small hips, slightly larger waist), and feel a lot of frustration with being read pretty much universally as male—ideally, I'd be very hard to read with a slight bias towards being read as female.  I've been thinking about HRT as a possible option, but I've got a lot of hesitations.  First of all, while breast development would not be a problem for me per se, it's not really my goal and I feel like having breasts would just get inconvenient.  Second, I know that going on estrogen can cause significant mood changes, and I'm worried about how I'd handle that as someone who has a bit of a tendency to be overly emotional as it is.  Third, I'm in a serious relationship (coincidentally, with another trans person), and I'm concerned about how the loss of libido could affect our relationship.  

Do any of y'all have experience with this, or know resources geared towards non-binary people that could help me figure out if this makes sense for me?

Preemptive apology for the brain dump.

Alright... 33, AFAB, as a young'un I would wear my brother's briefs and stuff them with socks when I was home alone. Made fake penises with tin foil to pee standing up. Tomboy, Hated 'cute' and dresses (sometimes). Super jilted that my brother got to play sports instead of me. I also was into typical girly things and gravitated towards strong girls in most of all of my reading. I like make-up, but want to wash it off my face 5 minutes after putting it on. I like dresses, but feel beyond uncomfortable in them. I prefer jeans and sweater/oxford shirt combos. I love winter and fall, so I can hide in my clothes.

My wife is transitioning MTF. I never had an issue being the top or bottom during adult time (even before she came out to me). I like the power of being a top, but also like being a bottom.  I think my feelings about my gender started when my wife started socially transitioning. I don't like feeling like a copycat, but maybe her transition just brought all of these feelings and memories to the forefront of my brain? 

I've had chest dysphoria for as long as I could remember, but attributed that to NEVER having the cute little perky breasts that most girls had. It's a source of daily terrible feelings about myself. The past bunch of years has been a constant battle to hide my top half from view, resulting in slouched shoulders, poor posture, and a relentless ache in my mid-back.

**Background**

So I am Amab, who has been a closet crossdresser for a few years now. I've been slowly putting more mental and time investment into dressing in the last 4 months because of stresses and other factors.

I've always been very content gendering myself as a man. It just ""felt right"" when considering my gender. I consider my gender expression more fluid. But I am male-leaning (that and the fact that when dressing my goal has rarely been to pass. I don't tuck or do a huge amount to hide my ""maleness"" aside from shaving).

**The experience**

Yesterday, I felt my first major pang of dysphoria during an outing dressed. I had just bought my first wig (yay for Halloween stores), and was adjusting it in a public restroom when it hit me. ""*OMG, who is that girl in the mirror? Wait... that's me! What the heck, what the heck, what the... I love it!*"" I felt the shiver, and for the next few hours while I had the wig on I just stared at myself in love/disbelief. It just felt... happy.

Now granted, I know I'm not a perfect pass, but this was the first time I had **ever** felt any type of serious dysphoria. And it was purely a positive dysphoria. Not a ""I dislike my male body"", but more like ""I love this fem body"".

**The problem**

So now what? I'm having trouble digesting this experience and moving forward. Transition of any kind has never really been on the table because I never felt trans; I still don't feel trans. I still feel male, I still feel alright as a male. I'm just not sure how to handle this experience.

How do ya'll handle these pangs of dysphoria? Was this dysphoria? Any experiences or advice in this arena? 

Thank you!

35,2017-09-20 15:33:13,71busv,7,17,"I've been on hormones for a year this week. I'm realizing that I don't have nearly as much dysphoria over my chest as I initially thought. At this point I don't want top surgery at all. In fact, I wouldn't complain if my chest was even a bit bigger. 

Yet I'm still interested in phalloplasty. My lower dysphoria is excruciating and I *need* phallo for my mental health. 

I have a phenomenal therapist who is earning her PhD in transgender health. She treats all of the trans students on campus. But I'm still nervous about the idea of talking to her about this. 

I struggled for years with internalized transphobia and I think I'm experiencing the same thing in coming to terms with my gender fluidity. 

Because I love my breasts but also want a penis, I'm worried that my therapist may get the impression that this is just some weird kinky thing, although I've been seeing her long enough to know that she's educated on nonbinary identities and would likely take this seriously. 

I feel like a freak even though I know I'm not. I've socially transitioned and then detransitioned once before already from lack of resources and support systems. I've been out as a binary trans man for nearly two years and I'm so afraid of how others would react to this. I've been enjoying expressing femininity and masculinity in tandem. 

Things haven't felt 100% even after being on hormones for nearly a year but I've been packing and wearing bras for the past week and this feels oddly right. I'm stopping hormones for a bit to see whether that helps the situation.

I've socially transitioned and then detransitioned once before already from lack of resources and support systems. I've been out as a binary trans man for nearly two years and I'm so afraid of how others would react to this. I've been enjoying expressing femininity and masculinity in tandem. \n\nThings haven't felt 100% even after being on hormones for nearly a year but I've been packing and wearing bras for the past week and this feels oddly right. I'm stopping hormones for a bit to see whether that helps the situation. I'm happy with the changes that I've had from it but I worry that if I had anymore changes from T that it'd just make my dysphoria worse at this point.

58,2017-09-28 04:50:33,72xxq3,6,1,"Hey all! I'm AMAB, and for a while I that I thought I was genderfluid. I felt girly at times, wore feminine clothes, painted my nails, all that stuff. It came and it went, some times hitting me harder than others. Throughout this time, I was smoking weed pretty much every day. I felt a lot more feminine and comfortable with it when I was high. I guess from doing that all the time, it started to encompass how I felt in day to day life, with me feeling more feminine and growing more comfortable in doing so.

After a while of feeling weird about everything, I took a bit of a break from smoking. Stopped for a couple months, and when I did smoke, it wasn't in excess. I started to feel like a guy again, and didn't feel feminine anymore, at least not to that degree. I think about it every once in a while, how I sort of miss expressing that side of me, but realize that I feel better off presenting as the gender I was born as.

Sometimes when I smoke, I don't feel feminine whatsoever. Maybe the weed just enhanced those feelings when I was feeling like that and made me hyper aware of it? Other times though, it's like a switch is flipped. I go from feeling 100% guy to 100% female. I carry myself differently, sit/move differently, basically feeling like a different person.

I'm AMAB, and for a while I that I thought I was genderfluid. I felt girly at times, wore feminine clothes, painted my nails, all that stuff. It came and it went, some times hitting me harder than others. Throughout this time, I was smoking weed pretty much every day. I felt a lot more feminine and comfortable with it when I was high. I guess from doing that all the time, it started to encompass how I felt in day to day life, with me feeling more feminine and growing more comfortable in doing so.\n\nAfter a while of feeling weird about everything, I took a bit of a break from smoking. Stopped for a couple months, and when I did smoke, it wasn't in excess. I started to feel like a guy again, and didn't feel feminine anymore, at least not to that degree. I think about it every once in a while, how I sort of miss expressing that side of me, but realize that I feel better off presenting as the gender I was born as.\n\nSometimes when I smoke, I don't feel feminine whatsoever. Maybe the weed just enhanced those feelings when I was feeling like that and made me hyper aware of it? Other times though, it's like a switch is flipped. I go from feeling 100% guy to 100% female. I carry myself differently, sit/move differently, basically feeling like a different person. It's weird, and I just wanted some of your input on this. Anyone else in a similar boat?
