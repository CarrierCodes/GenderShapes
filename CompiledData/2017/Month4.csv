Some background: I work at a small (30 people) startup based in NYC, although I generally work remotely. I've been working there for a year, over which I've been changing my outward presentation.

I was planning on coming into the office on Friday, so I asked the CEO in advance if we could schedule a short chat first thing in the morning, reassuring him that there wasn't any bad news. Once we were face-to-face I told him that my gender identity had been changing over the last several years, and that I am genderqueer and my pronouns were they/them. He said something to the effect of ""That's great, is there anything you need from me?"" I told him that all I needed was for him to use my proper pronouns and back me up if necessary.  I told him that I had prepared a short email to send out to the rest of the staff, and asked him if he wanted me to share it with him first. He told me to just go ahead and send it.

&gt; Hi fellow [company name]-ists,
&gt;
&gt; So I'm writing you all to let you know of a change that's been going on for me over the past year or so. I'll try to keep it short (-ish).
&gt;
&gt; I've come to find that my gender identity isn't quite what I thought it was. My gender is nonbinary and genderqueer. I'm not male or female. You may (or may not) have noticed that I've been looking a little different lately. That's what's going on.
&gt;
&gt; The only change that I'm asking from all of you is to use my new pronouns, which are [""they"" / ""them"" / ""their.""](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) I appreciate your understanding with regards to this.
&gt;
&gt; So, at this point, all of you know me at least a little bit, and I hope this doesn't change anything in our working relationship. Also, I'm open to answering any clarifying questions you might have. 
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

After I sent that, I got several replies from coworkers that were very short and sweet, to the effect of ""Sure, no problem.""

This is my first time sharing my experience and standpoint in online forum, so bear with me. 
I was AFAB, grew up a tomboy. I'm also a social scientist and a queer activist, and I believe that has led me to better understand my desidered gender identification, i.e.: non-binary. It actually took me a while to come to terms to the fact, that thanks but no thanks, I had no desire to turn into Mr.Right. First it was ""I'm not FTM enough, hence a coward"", now it's more ""it would have been easier if I was actually was FTM"" (without disrespect to the challenges our FTM brothers face). 
Currently I socially manage my gender identification by using both female and male pronouns, a gender neutral first name, male clothing and mannerism. My rationale is simple: if I'm striving for ambiguity, undecidability, neutrality, and I was AFAB, I need to ""counterbalance"" such assignment by ""adding"" some masculinity. I'm now looking into T therapy in order to further reach such balance as well as some specific effects that I hope would mitigate body dysphoria (i.e.: voice lowering, fat redistribution).
The practical problem I face is that I live in a EU country where transgender standards of care are quite behind, and doctors won't prescribe T to a person who does not come forward with the conventional ""wrong body"" narrative seeking a full-dose treatment with the goal of ""perfect passing"".

I've been questioning my gender for a while now. It started after my best friend came out as genderfluid, and this made me look more critically at my own gender and I've been kinda confused... 

So, I've always been masculine (I'm afab). Even since I was little I always preferred ""boy's"" clothes and interests associated with boys and masculinity. I vaguely remember thinking that I wished I was a boy back then too (although I no longer feel that way now that I know NB genders are a thing) though I think that was because I didn't like the things usually associated with girls, or act ""like a girl"". 
I had very long hair until two years ago and I always hated it so after I cut it was much happier and more confident in my appearance because I looked more like how I envisioned myself. 

During puberty I hated having boobs. I tried to ignore it but I could only do that so long. When my mum took me bra shopping for the first time I just started crying afterwards. Like, proper sobbing. These days I'm more comfortable with my chest but there are days when I wish it was flat, and I'm only comfortable with it when I'm wearing loose fitting shirts - which are the only type I ever wear now. I'm planning on getting a binder at some point. My voice is quite deep for someone who's afab (If anyone has played Batman: Arkham Asylum, I can reach Batman's pitch fairly easily) which I really like. I used to dislike having a deeper voice than other girls but I've grown to really enjoy it because I feel like it suits me more. I still find myself wishing I had a more masculine figure however. 

There's days when I identify a lot with being a woman and days when I feel weird about the term being used to refer to me. I don't feel like a man, just really masculine or somewhere in between when I'm not feeling so much like a woman on those days. I'm cool with most pronouns being used and when people mistake me for a boy I'm not *too* bothered by it, and if I confuse them about my gender then that's perfect. I really like looking androgynous most days. Sometimes not, but most days I do. Sometimes when I've had to count how many girls are, say, going to a friends house, I'd be like ""oh yeah, I'm a girl"". Like I forget that other people consider me a girl and would count me as such?

I currently have very little facial hair, but I'm concerned that I might get more in the future, which I would quite dislike. Hormones might help with preventing this. However, I don't know if I'll get significantly more facial hair even without hormones, so this might not matter. My brother is about a year older than me and seems to still be getting more facial hair coming in, which suggests that I'll meet the same fate. An alternative to hormones is to use electrolysis or regular shaving combined with beard shadow concealer if necessary. This would be a hassle, though probably not as large of a hassle as hormones.


I'm currently 5' 8'', but I think I was 5' 7'' a year ago, so I may or may not be still growing. I'd really rather not get any taller. I don't know if I will, though; despite being only 5' 8'', I'm already substantially taller than everyone else in my atomic family. The change in height might have been to measurement error due to me just using a tape measurer and no mirror when I measured 5"" 7', but I doubt this.



To prevent the above two problems, I could take testosterone blockers. This would take time, cost money, and may have side-effects. Furthermore, [this](https://neutrois.me/2013/11/25/mtn-transition/) says that female hormones are required for bone health and other things. I heard someone say their doctor let them take testosterone blockers and the doctor didn't recommend taking female hormones for now, though. Taking female hormones would add further cost, inconvenience, and risk. It would also feminize the body, resulting in fat redistribution, thinner skin, and breast growth. I have a slight preference for fat distribution, probably a slight preference against breast growth, and no preference about thinner skin. Edit: Actually, I am neutral about breast growth.

It's been nearly four months since I finally figured it out at the ripe old age of 47, yet yesterday one of the things that was most obvious only just occurred to me.

For years (since at least the late 1990s) my husband (MtF, non-transitioned) has suggested I was repressed FtM and needed testosterone. I always responded immediately that I I love being a woman and would never want to give that up.

Not once did I ever respond that I didn't want to be a man. I never thought about it that way in those moments, but I often wished I could have that magic pill that could change me into a man - as long as I had the equivalent magic pill so I could be female again.

Until recently, I didn't know (understand) what non-binary was. I kinda knew what agender and androgyne were, and that's what I thought non-binary meant, just those two things. I only heard the term ""non-binary"" for the first time a couple of years ago. I knew I was neither agender or androgyne, so I immediately dismissed it as important concept for my personal use.

I told my adult children and my parents about my gender status verbally in February, and now I'm writing letters to my close family members (aunt, uncles, and a close friend). While writing it I compiled a list of many of the signs of my being transgender over the years. Seeing it in writing, all in one place, the evidence is pretty overwhelming. I feel as if I have been blind to miss it all.

All along, there was only one piece missing that kept me from understanding who and what I am. The  lack of understanding of what being non-binary is.

However, I also realize if I had figured it out as a teenager in the 1980s I would have had nowhere to go with it and would have ended up banging my head against a wall. My ignorance protected me. Non-binary was barely known or acknowledged by the psych world at that time, and treatment (even HRT) was denied to any trans person who wasn't binary AND planned to have only hetero relationships once transitioned.

My abuelita on my dad's side just called me yesterday, it had been a few years since we had last spoken. I didn't get to call her back out of panic listening to my voicemail. My relatives had explained to her that both my brother and I are trans and accepted that. However, she's old and since english isn't her first language also it would be really difficult to be seen the way that I accurately am.

My situation is much more complex than my brother. He's a little trans boy so because he's of a binary gender its a little more easier in a way to see him as such. With me I have a really mixed gender expression, i had only changed one of my pronouns to a non traditional one.

53,2017-04-17 17:46:07,65x3hu,3,17,"Greetings all!
Firstly I'd like to say thank you to everyone who keeps this sub running strong, even though it's such a small community it's amazing to see regular posts and positive discussion going on even in the minority of the minority, your openess and willingness to share is what's made me want to reciprocate, so keep it up everyone. Secondly, I wanted to make a post regarding my own gender and journey so far in a bid to offer a bit of personal advice to anyone in a similar situation as me. I think as we are such a unique community, it is really important we be transparent with one another as speaking from personal experience, I think we truly need as much help to dispel our own fears, misrepresentations and misinformations as possible.

So, to start at the beginning, I am transgender and am currently transitioning from what I believe to be a non-binary male form to more of a non-binary female form and what does this mean exactly? Well, the way I see it, I have never felt like a man. My sex is male, I have all the bits and anatomy of a masculine, buff cliché but I have never felt comfortable thinking of myself as, referring to myself as or even just 'being' a male.

And strangely enough, when I start to think and dare to believe myself as being more of a female, suddenly some things become a little more comfortable. Emotionally, physically, sexually, all these areas that I now see changing are somehow congruent with how I have always felt inside. But not everything it seems, is so black and white. Because even though my breasts are starting to develop, my hips are widening and my body is going through the puberty I felt I never had, there is still much of me which feels confident in my original biology. I feel natural in my unnatural, a complex combination of masculine and feminine traits portrayed imperfectly through my being.

There are days when I wake up feeling masculine and sometimes even mere moments where this aspect blends through my personality. It could be a song, a smell, a memory or a feeling which has me react in a certain way which feels more manly than anything else. It could be the people I am with, the time and place or even for no reason at all, that all of a sudden I project and experience a masculine version of myself.

Then the same goes for the feminine. A touch, a whimsy, an embrace or a taste which has me feeling so comfortable in my soft, feminine skin and I react outwardly and inwardly as any other mother, sister or daughter would.

And then I am reminded of how I am supposed to choose. One or the other, Adam or Eve. They don't make bathrooms for people like me, we don't exist except in futuristic dystopian novels about robots and bio-mechanics. So I feel confused and undone, not knowing where my man should stop and my woman should begin. For if I have to choose I must only be half of myself and doom the unselected version to be only my shadow. I cannot do this. It is not a choice, not one I am willing to make for myself. Because no matter how much 'easier' it might make my life externally, internally there is death of the being, of the self and then I would lose what it would mean to be human. So don't you dare, you beautiful person.

Don't ever feel as though you have to choose. Your life is yours, your feelings your own, we ask ourselves who we are, but very rarely do we ask ourselves who we are not. So, TLDR: here is my advice, to everyone our there non-binary, binary or questioning.

Dare to live. Be who you are and learn to reject who you are not. Nobody can tell you how you feel and it is up to you to discover where you are most yourself!

54,2017-04-17 18:46:00,65xhcz,2,7,"Hi there! So I apologize for this being possibly lengthy, but I'll try my best.

I've always felt like I was an ""alien,"" and it's hard to describe this feeling. I grew up as a girl and I somewhat identify as a woman, but I don't feel like I'm quite there yet?

I had a bit of a crisis last year (maybe it was gender dysphoria? I am unsure), and my boyfriend at the time who, after spending months telling me that people who ID as genderqueer and nonbinary were just doing so to be unique and special snowflakes, started referring to himself as these things (which, was incredibly ironic). I think he even told a woman that he was ""a cis nonbinary male"" or something, which seems contradictory? Anyway, I told him that I was having a bit of a crisis, and in my mind, whatever constitutes ""womanhood,"" I felt like I was on the lower end of that scale, but definitely knowing that I was *not* a man. I figured someone who is now calling himself nonbinary would surely be understanding and compassionate about what I was experiencing?

I was wrong. He laughed at me, thought I was being cute/adorable. I never brought it up again.

Side note: He ended up being exposed on Facebook for being abusive and predatory. This was actually not the first time that he had been accused of this, but this was the only time where it stuck. I think the post is still up there. Has over a thousand comments and hundreds of shares. It turned out that he, like many other men it seems, use certain labels to gain women's trust, enter their spaces and start harassing them. Among other things, he claimed that he was autistic and couldn't read ""social cues"" (though honestly when someone tells you that your persistent calling and texting is making them uncomfortable and that you should stop, that's not a cue. That's pretty blatant), ""intersexed"" (allegedly had a genetic test done and claimed he had like 10% female chromosomes), queer (despite being hetero), panromatic, etc. etc. He was extremely narcissistic.

Anyway, fast forward a few months, and I come across this guy on Facebook. We talk for a little bit and then our interactions fizzled out a bit. We start talking again and I notice his profile says that he's nonbinary. So I ask him if I can ask him a somewhat personal question. He says yes. I ask if he's an enby (I didn't know too much about it at the time, but figured that if he at least knew what that meant, then perhaps he's not bullshitting). He says ""Yessum."" So then we spend about a whole hour talking about this. The crux of my position was (and this will sound extremely silly) but I often feel like there are these ""women meetings"" that women seem to go to, maybe it's very week or every month or whenever the Moon is full or whatever. And they go to these meetings to swap tips or give lectures on how to be a woman. And either someone has deliberately given me the wrong address or I keep missing out on these meetings.

He basically feels the same way. I did mention to him that I am a bit weary of ""men"" who describe themselves as enby as a foil to being predatory or pulling the whole ""I'm not a man!"" when they are accused of sexism/misogyny. But he told me that my experiences are my experiences.

Fast forward another month and I come out to him as an enby. I think I feel somewhat more comfortable describing myself as that? He tells me he's proud of me and I can't stop smiling. it just feels super nice to be understood.

Kinda new to reddit here...

I've been on HRT for about a month now, I don't really know anyone else who identifies as non-binary and is also taking hormones.

I've always wanted to look a lot more feminine and present as androgynous. I started HRT to help with my dysphoria and hopefully look the way that I've always felt...
I'm worried about regret when it comes to my overall results with hrt... 

Just kind of curious to see if anyone else felt the same way. I feel like there's not really a whole lot of information out there...

86,2017-04-25 09:10:56,67ff2r,9,8,"So, I'm 30, AMAB. I've been trying to figure out my identity for as long as I can remember.

Sorry, this is gonna be disorganized and all over the place. (Also, it might get a tiny bit sexually descriptive at points, though I'll try to keep it as tame as possible.)

I can't remember exactly when my gender dysphoria started, but it definitely wasn't any later than early adolescence.. I actually have a very bad long term memory for childhood memories in general though.

But yes, I've struggled with varying levels of gender dysphoria during my life.

I grew up as the younger of two brothers in a semi-dysfunctional lower-middle-class family. Not great, not absolutely terrible, maybe average. I've always been very weird, borderline autistic-like, antisocial, etc. I wouldn't say I'm super close to either of my parents, but I probably bonded a little more with my mom than my dad. They divorced when I was 13. My brother and I continued to live with our dad.

There were times growing up where one thing would lead to another and I'd get hit by my older brother, or by my father. I was never savagely beaten to a bloody pulp or anything, but it was enough to engender a lot of rage in me, feelings of angry powerlessness.  I feel like it may have been a contributing factor to a bit of a negative outlook I developed of masculinity.

I think I sort of ended up constructing in my mind something along the lines of: Male = large = powerful = dominating = stupid = brutish, solves problems through force rather than intellect. I kinda rationally know it's a bit garbage, but.. it's kinda a feeling that formed.
In my adult years I do regularly rebel against these stereotypes wherever I find them, perhaps due to whatever small part of me that feels some connection to my biological maleness, or because I don't want these things assumed about me because of the body I have.
I don't know, it's like I rationally understand, or have been trying to convince/teach myself, that there isn't anything gross or barbaric about maleness, that I just need an attitude readjustment, but the feeling of ""yuck"" towards maleness remains.

Also, my mom was an evening alcoholic. And that may have caused me to lose some respect for femininity as well, perhaps. I probably have just a tiny bit of internalized misogyny.. I can admit.. at least under a throwaway account.. Ideas like: Woman = childlike = immature = emotional = stupid.

Note that both genders have ""stupid"" in common, in my little messed up brain. I've been a bit of a misanthrope at times in my life. I'm trying to become a more positive person though. I'm a work in progress.

Sorry I'm rambling.

So, when I was a young boy, there were a few times I sorta did ""gay stuff"" with my young male friends during sleepovers. And to this day, I consider myself ""(barely) bisexual"" and occasionally do it with men. But I am (with men) exclusively a bottom, and rarely find males visually attractive at all. To me, it really seems that my forays into homosexual behavior are a way of feeling more feminine, and that may be really all it is - that I may otherwise ""supposed to have been"" ""straight"".

None of my gay experiences were ever about me wanting to see or touch someone's penis. It has always been more like.. I want to get naked and for this other person to become aroused by me. I wanted them to fondle me. Etc. I want to feel feminine.

I'm ~95% attracted to girls, but I have difficulty with them, not in general interactions but I mean in terms of trying to pick them up sexually or romantically. I find it easy to pick up gay top men, because I feel more natural in a feminine seductive role. I feel dysphoric when I have to ""chase"" girls. It makes me feel more like a ""guy"", it makes me feel unwanted, it makes me feel like I'm some worthless vermin hunting for something beautiful. When really inside, I feel like I am a beautiful thing worth chasing myself, but as I'm in a boy's body, a boy's role is expected of me. That's kinda where the gay comes in, I can get that need satisfied in a way by being chased by gay men.

Switching gears slightly here now..  Though I considered I may be MTF trans for a time around age 14 or so, I then decided ""no, I don't want to transition, I don't want to be an imperfect girl through surgery. if i could make a wish and magically be a girl, i'd do it. but failing that I'd rather try to girlify the ""boy"" that I am as much as possible without surgeries and medications, be a ""boy"" but be girly, buck the expectations, be unique, whatever.""

My gender dysphoria would end up semi-dying down for a while while I was in a 6 year relationship with a girl who turned out to be a sociopath. We were mostly doing drugs and not having a real life during that time.

Cut to after that nightmare which I won't spend any time on here, I start going back to school and studying singing. My gender dysphoria starts coming back a bit because I want to be able to sing higher / more girly. While I'm studying singing, I meet this girl and fall madly in love with her, she doesn't like me the same way back. My gender dysphoria gets even stronger.

So, quick pause to say, up to shortly before this point, I don't think I was aware of non binary. I had been living several years of my life basically thinking ""I feel gender dysphoria, but I'm not quite a 'real' trans person, so I guess I have to just get over it by acting kinda girly where I can.""

Now I discover the gender non binary stuff. I'm a very skeptical person, so I was very suspicious of it at first. Still to some degree am, but it's growing on me. Yet there does somewhat remain this fear of, ""what if I decided to come out, identify as non binary, then 5-10 years later, some real scientific research comes out and it turns out we really ARE just snowflakes coming up with bullshit? Then I'd look like an idiot.""

But.. anyway.. yeah.. umm..

So.. I'm grossed out by body hair. I'm grossed out by bathroom humor. I have never in my life felt any desire to be larger, taller, older, etc. I (irrationally) see tallness as some sort of opposite to intelligence. I am not tall myself, but when I see a tall male, I secretly in my head sometimes think something like ""Jesus, look at that huge behemoth. If I were that tall, I'd kill myself."" I know, not healthy thoughts.

I trim my body hair down to almost nothing (easier to maintain than shaving, and I have light hair). I shave my armpits. I paint my nails. I wear colorful clothing and scarves. I wear make-up. Sometimes I skip around daintily. I like games like Mario Kart and Zelda over Grand Theft Auto or Mortal Kombat. I like Taylor Swift and Sia. I thoroughly enjoy the company of girls. Though I always kinda feel like my ability to present as feminine as I want is limited. I would wear skirts and dresses if I were female, and I lament that I can't pull them off so well as a boy, and so am generally not so daring to do so. I regularly feel limited in my clothing options for events and feel envious of the girl's and all the options they have.

As I mentioned before, my vocal range brings on dysphoria. Luckily I am not a low bass or anything, more like a high baritone or low-ish tenor. But still, it is a male voice. I associate a deep voice not with more respectability as seems to be the traditional association, but rather with stupidity, cave-man-likeness, etc. Hearing a female do that exaggeratedly low pitched impersonation of a man voice is very triggering to me. (""Is that how they see me? Some deep voiced retarded behemoth monster?"")
I want to sing the melody, not the bassline. I want my voice to sound smooth and pure and high and light, not low edgy heavy and brassy.

But.. so.. well.. I'm non binary. I've considered the terms: agender, gender-fluid, demi-boy, demi-girl, transfeminine. I don't think I'll ever be able to pick one. I think the concept of non-binary genders in western culture is still very young and primitive, and we need a better set of classifications... I feel like there are duplicates, I feel like some of the genders that have been invented are ridiculous. Genders having to do with the phases of the moon? Come on.

I feel like I am biologically male, but have a gender identity not conforming to either male nor female, although probably a tiny bit closer to female, but that many of the people talking in favor of the gender non-binary are going a little crazy with it. I feel determined to find the sane way to understand all of this. I disagree with the people who say there are only two genders, and I dislike the disrespect they give the non-binary community. But I think some of the people in the non-binary community are kinda making us an easy target with the easy-going way we've approached labeling these nonbinary genders so far.

I don't want to fight with anyone. I don't want to make anyone feel disrespected. I am indeed on your side but I have some reservations due to my skepticism is all. I am a nice person. I don't bite.

I just don't know what to make of all this. I wanna find a better way to be myself, but I'm afraid of being wrong. I want to be reasonable, and I don't want to be a ""trans-trender.""

I don't know what I am. I am relatively ok with ""he/him"" pronouns, and will also happily accept ""they/them"" although I won't ask for nor demand it. It does NOT bother me when someone calls me a ""boy"" - in fact, I almost kind of like it.. - but I HATE the word ""guy"". Same with ""dude"" and ""man"". I don't think I am a girl although I do think I should have been a girl.

I know what body parts I have, what chromosomes I have, and I know how I feel, but I don't know how to identify myself. I have told a few close friends and family members that I have gender dysphoria and have been considering the gender non-binary thing within the past year. And I live in a pretty liberal area. But, I still have reservations about coming totally ""out"".  Although there are times when I feel like if I was totally out, I wouldn't have to secretly feel hurt by certain things people say, not meaning any harm.


Ugh.. I feel bad, like I'm just rambling a huge wall of text without asking any simple primary question. I guess just.. I needed to vent, express myself and my thoughts and worries without a filter with the aid of online anonymity... and just.. if anyone has any general advice, or ideas about what terms might best fit me? Lately I'm leaning toward ""transfeminine"".  I've thought about demigirl or demiboy, but honestly, I have no idea which one I'd pick.


Sorry if this is way too long.

TL;DR version:  I am AMAB and questioning my gender identity and the entire concept of gender and non-binary genders. I have gender dysphoria about being male, and wish I had been born female, but do not wish to transition to female as things stand, and do not identify as female, and can't help but feel it's my knowledge of my own biology, at least in part, that prevents me from feeling right identifying as female. I feel more drawn to identifying as non-binary, but I feel dissatisfied with the definitions and terms and such.. And with all the confusing choices, I just really don't know how to identify.

So I'm AFAB nonbinary and want to present as a genderfuck. For those unaware, I want to be seen as neither a girl or a boy. I want people to guess and be confused. 
The only problems are:
1. I'm not on T and have no plans to be in the future. Despite my muscles and relatively lower voice, I still pass for female. 
2. Because of my physical disability, doing my makeup is difficult, and the majority of dresses/skirts are too short to be worn comfortably in my wheelchair. So presenting femininely is a challenge. 
3. I have large breasts, hips, a sizable butt, and curves. Binding is an almost daily occurrence but I lack the money for a proper masc/femme wardrobe. So anything I try to create on masculine days--about 90% of the time-- isn't even convincing and just makes things worse. 
It's hard enough not having family acceptance. My lack of recognition elsewhere is stifling.

Because of my physical disability, doing my makeup is difficult, and the majority of dresses/skirts are too short to be worn comfortably in my wheelchair. So presenting femininely is a challenge. \n3. I have large breasts, hips, a sizable butt, and curves. Binding is an almost daily occurrence but I lack the money for a proper masc/femme wardrobe. So anything I try to create on masculine days--about 90% of the time-- isn't even convincing and just makes things worse. \nIt's hard enough not having family acceptance. My lack of recognition elsewhere is stifling. \nAny tips for being a disabled AFAB genderfuck?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Help becoming a genderfuck part 2', 'created': 1493208096.0}"

With all the cultural changes going on in today's society, I feel a bit lost in it all.  I have a few questions that I would greatly appreciate some answers for.

* **1:  What is Gender Identity**
* **2:  What is a Gender Role**
* **3:  What is Gender Expression**

and lastly

* **4: How are these things different from one another?**

I've tried searching this up, but the general idea I'm getting from it is that Gender Identity has no weight or meaning, but that doesn't sound right considering the passion that I've seen people share for it.  Anyway, I thought I would ask a community that probably knows more about this than I.  Thank you for taking your time to respond!

Basically I'm a 21 year old bi female, I guess. Buttt more and more I've found myself identifying strongly with the way males look. 
Initially I thought I just found these guys attractive, then it dawned on me that it was a bit more than that, I sort of wished I looked like them. 

The last couple of months these thoughts have become more frequent, and I think I'm more open to accepting them for what they are. I'm dating a trans girl so obviously we talk about gender a lot and I think that's allowed me to be more open to the fact I could be something other than a binary gender.

I've fantasised about having a penis, taking a more ""masculine"" role during sex and stuff as well. 

Although I say these feelings are recent, I've always identified with males, and I've always dressed in a fairly ""masculine"" way. In fact my mother often tells the story of me as a child telling her that ""when I grow up, I'm going to be a boy"". 

I certainly also identify with certain more feminine things, wearing skirts, wearing makeup, keeping my hair long etc. 

So yeah I just would like some input from people who have a better grasp on this than I do. 
It's deffo been causing me a bit of stress recently. I know no one can tell me exactly what's going on but any advice would be great.

I am 24 years old and I was assigned male at birth.
I still present as a male, I only started doing some laser hair removal sessions.
I thought I was just a gay guy till two years ago, but then I started thinking more and more to be transgender.
Now the point is what I really want to be and how I can express myself better.

The things that make think that I am no binary are:
- the fact that I don't want to have a SRS
- I hate the fact that hormones will damage my body in a long term, and I hate the fact that hormones will decrease my libido, sex drive and erections.
- I am thus comfortable with my libido and my genitals (as long as I don't need to use it in a penetrative way).
- I don't want to change the pitch of my voice (maybe I am just lazy).

By the way I'd really like to have a more feminine body and face.

I think for me being a girl would make me feel free to express who I really am, but then I wonder why I cannot express my self properly even as a boy.
Is it because of internalized homophobia?
I don't let my self being feminine, and I always try to fit in boxes.

103,2017-04-29 20:51:30,68bmwy,9,11,"**CW: non-detailed mention of eating disorders, sexual abuse/csa, and incest**. Also this is hella long so apologies in advance, there's a lot to get off my chest.

I have C-PTSD, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and BPD as a result of a shit upbringing. No shocker there. I've also displayed gender nonconforming behavior my whole life starting at age two -- I speculate that my NB identity is a product of both nature and nurture. Nonetheless, I am astutely aware of how much my PTSD and BPD in particular intersect with this facet of my identity. I've experienced a loooot of sexual trauma starting in childhood continuing through my teen years and adult life from multiple abusers, and I still actively experience covert incest perpetuated by my father. I've come to realize these things over time:

I think a lot of my gender identity was formed as a defense mechanism. I probably would have been much more okay with femininity, or even with being AFAB, had I not grown up with sexual trauma, incest, and parents who berated me for not fulfilling my role as a daughter to their liking. So I rejected all things associated with femininity both as rebellion and as a means to protect myself from my father being inappropriate.. essentially, I wanted to neuter/desex myself, and I also internalized the idea that being a girl meant being a victim. I believed boys were strong; they didn't experience these things because they were the ones with power (obviously incorrect). Puberty was horrifying to me, naturally, and I IDed as transmasculine from ages 12 to 20. (That was influenced by a LOT of internalized misogyny and feeling like I had to pick one or the other.) I've experimented with performing traditional femininity, too, and liked some parts of it.. others were traumatic because of shit relationships, so I have a more positive relationship with my femme side now, but still very messy. 

And my BPD just makes it all muddier. I have incredibly low self-worth and a weak/guilty sense of identity, and I ""shapeshift"" a lot in many facets of it except those most integral to who I am. I've struggled my whole life trying to decide who or what I want to be and do. That's thankfully improving with therapy and building my independence, but I'm also very attuned to the fact that this plays a role in the maddening amount of gender fluidity I experience. I feel things intensely, sporadically, and fluidly, and my gender identity is unfortunately no exception. The eating disorders love to play into this too; not only do I get body dysphoria sometimes, but I also get body dysmorphia! It's insane trying to identify them and figure out how much of my body hate is societal conditioning and resultant dysmorphia vs. how much of it is disliking my body for being AFAB. Still haven't really managed to untangle all that. Doesn't help that I experience a lot of dissociation too, so feeling connected to my body? Yeah, that's a joke.

Sometimes it feels like I have several gender identities: One that's cis female, one that's trans male, and the androgyne in between. Most of the time I identify as nothing/in the center; other times I love my AFAB body and all that comes with it; sometimes I get enamored with the idea of how I'd look if I had a masculine presentation. The last one mostly happens when I see/look at a picture of/read and write with characters who are cute men, and I want to be like them. I want to have facial hair, a deeper voice, throw on a t-shirt without worrying about how it lays over my breasts and hips, and be perceived as masculine. This was pretty rare for a while but I've noticed that I'm feeling it more lately. When I revel in being AFAB it often coincides with enjoying traditionally feminine clothing and wanting to be seen as delicate, small, young, and desirable. I do occasionally feel genuine empowerment/strength/joy from my identity as a woman, though-- sometimes I feel guilty or ungrateful for wanting to ""abandon"" it because it feels like I'm betraying women and the hardship they face and thus my own experiences with that, which I know is a common feeling among AFAB NB folks.

When I picture myself as androgynous it can kind of fluctuate from either left or right of center, but it usually just feels.. comfortable, I guess? When I want to be cis or transmasc it happens in short and exciting bursts, but picturing myself as how I'd ideally look as an androgyne is a slightly different flavor. I'll get euphoric at the thought of going on T and all the body changes it could provide -- nervous, too, but mostly curious and happy. I'm positive that I need to at least *try* it, if I can wrangle my counselor and doctor into giving me a referral, but I'm also scared. The thought of giving up cis passing privilege is terrifying. I place too much of my self-worth into my appearance and being perceived favorably by other people, too, so self-love and acceptance are things I'll have to work hard at to achieve a healthier relationship with myself and my queerness. I've internalized so much body shame, transphobia, and binarism, though. I'm sure everyone here knows how much of a struggle that is. I am also petrified by the thought of regretting T, even though I know that a low dose for a short amount of time won't usually have too negative an effect if you decide you don't like it; I'm afraid I'd be ""damaged goods"" then more than I already am now. Part of me hopes that as I work through all of this with my counselor I will learn to just be comfortable as a cis person, honestly, because it's so much easier. And safer. And less expensive. But rationally I know those are all the wrong reasons for me to want to be a woman.

I try to remind myself that my gender identity may be partly ""symptomatic"" of my abuses and disorders, but it's still me. That doesn't take anything away from it; I'm still nonbinary and queer. I am entitled to that and I have the right to be happy in my identity and my skin. I think I know the answers, I just haven't been ready to fully accept them. Every time I make forward progress (I've come out to my immediate family, friends, and health practitioners, and I've decided to change my middle name to a masculine variant) I doubt myself even though it feels right to do. I need to follow that gut feeling and stop letting my head get in the way.

Thank you if you read all this. Mostly I just needed to say it with the chance that somebody else might be able to empathize.

Nonetheless, I am astutely aware of how much my PTSD and BPD in particular intersect with this facet of my identity. I\'ve experienced a loooot of sexual trauma starting in childhood continuing through my teen years and adult life from multiple abusers, and I still actively experience covert incest perpetuated by my father. I\'ve come to realize these things over time:\n\nI think a lot of my gender identity was formed as a defense mechanism. I probably would have been much more okay with femininity, or even with being AFAB, had I not grown up with sexual trauma, incest, and parents who berated me for not fulfilling my role as a daughter to their liking. So I rejected all things associated with femininity both as rebellion and as a means to protect myself from my father being inappropriate.. essentially, I wanted to neuter/desex myself, and I also internalized the idea that being a girl meant being a victim. I believed boys were strong; they didn\'t experience these things because they were the ones with power (obviously incorrect). Puberty was horrifying to me, naturally, and I IDed as transmasculine from ages 12 to 20. (That was influenced by a LOT of internalized misogyny and feeling like I had to pick one or the other.) I\'ve experimented with performing traditional femininity, too, and liked some parts of it.. others were traumatic because of shit relationships, so I have a more positive relationship with my femme side now, but still very messy. \n\nAnd my BPD just makes it all muddier. I have incredibly low self-worth and a weak/guilty sense of identity, and I ""shapeshift"" a lot in many facets of it except those most integral to who I am. I\'ve struggled my whole life trying to decide who or what I want to be and do. That\'s thankfully improving with therapy and building my independence, but I\'m also very attuned to the fact that this plays a role in the maddening amount of gender fluidity I experience. I feel things intensely, sporadically, and fluidly, and my gender identity is unfortunately no exception. The eating disorders love to play into this too; not only do I get body dysphoria sometimes, but I also get body dysmorphia! It\'s insane trying to identify them and figure out how much of my body hate is societal conditioning and resultant dysmorphia vs. how much of it is disliking my body for being AFAB. Still haven\'t really managed to untangle all that. Doesn\'t help that I experience a lot of dissociation too, so feeling connected to my body? Yeah, that\'s a joke.\n\nSometimes it feels like I have several gender identities: One that\'s cis female, one that\'s trans male, and the androgyne in between. Most of the time I identify as nothing/in the center; other times I love my AFAB body and all that comes with it; sometimes I get enamored with the idea of how I\'d look if I had a masculine presentation. The last one mostly happens when I see/look at a picture of/read and write with characters who are cute men, and I want to be like them. I want to have facial hair, a deeper voice, throw on a t-shirt without worrying about how it lays over my breasts and hips, and be perceived as masculine. This was pretty rare for a while but I\'ve noticed that I\'m feeling it more lately. When I revel in being AFAB it often coincides with enjoying traditionally feminine clothing and wanting to be seen as delicate, small, young, and desirable. I do occasionally feel genuine empowerment/strength/joy from my identity as a woman, though-- sometimes I feel guilty or ungrateful for wanting to ""abandon"" it because it feels like I\'m betraying women and the hardship they face and thus my own experiences with that, which I know is a common feeling among AFAB NB folks.\n\nWhen I picture myself as androgynous it can kind of fluctuate from either left or right of center, but it usually just feels.. comfortable, I guess? When I want to be cis or transmasc it happens in short and exciting bursts, but picturing myself as how I\'d ideally look as an androgyne is a slightly different flavor. I\'ll get euphoric at the thought of going on T and all the body changes it could provide -- nervous, too, but mostly curious and happy. I\'m positive that I need to at least *try* it, if I can wrangle my counselor and doctor into giving me a referral, but I\'m also scared. The thought of giving up cis passing privilege is terrifying. I place too much of my self-worth into my appearance and being perceived favorably by other people, too, so self-love and acceptance are things I\'ll have to work hard at to achieve a healthier relationship with myself and my queerness. I\'ve internalized so much body shame, transphobia, and binarism, though. I\'m sure everyone here knows how much of a struggle that is. I am also petrified by the thought of regretting T, even though I know that a low dose for a short amount of time won\'t usually have too negative an effect if you decide you don\'t like it; I\'m afraid I\'d be ""damaged goods"" then more than I already am now. Part of me hopes that as I work through all of this with my counselor I will learn to just be comfortable as a cis person, honestly, because it\'s so much easier. And safer. And less expensive. But rationally I know those are all the wrong reasons for me to want to be a woman.\n\nI try to remind myself that my gender identity may be partly ""symptomatic"" of my abuses and disorders, but it\'s still me. That doesn\'t take anything away from it; I\'m still nonbinary and queer. I am entitled to that and I have the right to be happy in my identity and my skin. I think I know the answers, I just haven\'t been ready to fully accept them. Every time I make forward progress (I\'ve come out to my immediate family, friends, and health practitioners, and I\'ve decided to change my middle name to a masculine variant) I doubt myself even though it feels right to do. I need to follow that gut feeling and stop letting my head get in the way.\n\nThank you if you read all this. Mostly I just needed to say it with the chance that somebody else might be able to empathize. Does anybody else struggle with how their identity as an NB person intersects with mental illness and/or trauma? I can\'t imagine I\'m totally alone in all of this.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'On being nonbinary, mentally ill, and experiencing childhood sexual abuse', 'created': 1493524290.0}"

I'd let a friend of mine know before, but he was already out as a transmale and so I figured he'd know where I'm coming from. Family is different.

Like, my dad means well, but sometimes I feel like he's crushing me when what he's really trying to do is protect me from being ""too odd."" If I came out as genderfluid to him, I'm sure he'd just get behind me and support me, but at the same time, I know that it's hard for him. So there's that.

So last night I told my brother Matt how I feel, and tried to keep it on the DL from my sister Selene, whose bar we were at. After explaining how I felt and what being Genderfluid meant to me, he was like ""I love you. You're my sibling. I might not agree with everything you say, and I might forget to call you ""they,"" but I love you"" and so I told my sister Selene and she was cool with it as well!

I don't know why this was so hard. It shouldn't be hard. People I know are fond of me and shouldn't react bad. I don't know why this is so hard to do. I haven't told my sister Martha, but I think she knows, at some level, and doesn't want to bring it up until I'm ready to bring it up. Which I think I will do sooner than later. I plan to bring it up to my parents soon, so they know.

I don't want to post it to Facebook, but I do. Like, I want to let people know, but at the same time, I just want them to know. I don't want a series of ""Be Strong!"" and ""Power to You!"" posts. I just want people to know. I feel like letting a whole load of people know and them just supporting me because that's what you do is not what I want.

I don't want attention. I don't want an embarrassing out-pour of support that will dominate my every conversation with for the next few weeks. I just want them to know. But letting them know means they'll feel like speaking up. Or saying ""I knew it"" and things like that, which is worse because *I* didn't know it until a week ago, and even then it's only because this subreddit supported me in ways I didn't know I needed supporting.

So, that's what I have to say about that.

So there\'s that.\n\nSo last night I told my brother Matt how I feel, and tried to keep it on the DL from my sister Selene, whose bar we were at. After explaining how I felt and what being Genderfluid meant to me, he was like ""I love you. You\'re my sibling. I might not agree with everything you say, and I might forget to call you ""they,"" but I love you"" and so I told my sister Selene and she was cool with it as well!\n\nI don\'t know why this was so hard. It shouldn\'t be hard. People I know are fond of me and shouldn\'t react bad. I don\'t know why this is so hard to do. I haven\'t told my sister Martha, but I think she knows, at some level, and doesn\'t want to bring it up until I\'m ready to bring it up. Which I think I will do sooner than later. I plan to bring it up to my parents soon, so they know.\n\nI don\'t want to post it to Facebook, but I do. Like, I want to let people know, but at the same time, I just want them to know. I don\'t want a series of ""Be Strong!"" and ""Power to You!"" posts. I just want people to know. I feel like letting a whole load of people know and them just supporting me because that\'s what you do is not what I want.\n\nI don\'t want attention. I don\'t want an embarrassing out-pour of support that will dominate my every conversation with for the next few weeks. I just want them to know. But letting them know means they\'ll feel like speaking up. Or saying ""I knew it"" and things like that, which is worse because *I* didn\'t know it until a week ago, and even then it\'s only because this subreddit supported me in ways I didn\'t know I needed supporting.\n\nSo, that\'s what I have to say about that.\n\nThanks for listening!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I came out as Genderfluid to my siblings and it went really well!', 'created': 1491360916.0}"

I have come to you because I feel like I don't know where else to turn. My sibling is beginning an FTM transition (their first hormone shot is this Thursday!) and I am the only person in my family that supports their endeavor. We have a HUGE family and we're all really close, but first, my sib and I are trying to figure out together how to break the news to our parents. In the past, when my sib has brought up hormone therapy / not feeling like a female / being trans to them, my dad turns to drinking and my mom just shuts down. I have long been the source of interpreting either side, and understanding what each party is saying, between my parents and my sibling, and that's been exacerbated by our current situation.

So, I'm wondering if you have any advice for my sib on how to pose all of this to my parents / the rest of our fam. I'm also wondering if you or any of your siblings have resources for someone in my position? I want to be as supportive as possible but I'm finding it difficult to try and hold up my entire family.

This will be the 3rd floor of a mixed-use building. It will be a dance rehearsal studio and office. Total square footage is about 2800. I expect capacity to be just under 50.

What we want to do is build one genderless single-user ADA bathroom and another genderless single-user non-ADA bathroom. 

The Florida plumbing code says that whenever facilities are required, separate facilities are required for males and females. However, ultimately it's up to the coding official.

What sort of arguments are likely to hold the most sway? Can we say we're doing this to be friendly to the trans* community even if no one in our company is trans? Or would we be better off making some more mundane appeal to the occupancy number or the use classification?

If you haven't dealt with this issue, feel free to comment, but I'm specifically looking for the input from someone who has already gone through this with a city coding official.

Some background: I work at a small (30 people) startup based in NYC, although I generally work remotely. I've been working there for a year, over which I've been changing my outward presentation.

I was planning on coming into the office on Friday, so I asked the CEO in advance if we could schedule a short chat first thing in the morning, reassuring him that there wasn't any bad news. Once we were face-to-face I told him that my gender identity had been changing over the last several years, and that I am genderqueer and my pronouns were they/them. He said something to the effect of ""That's great, is there anything you need from me?"" I told him that all I needed was for him to use my proper pronouns and back me up if necessary.  I told him that I had prepared a short email to send out to the rest of the staff, and asked him if he wanted me to share it with him first. He told me to just go ahead and send it.

Here's the note I sent:
&gt; Hi fellow [company name]-ists,
&gt; So I'm writing you all to let you know of a change that's been going on for me over the past year or so. I'll try to keep it short (-ish).
&gt;
&gt; I've come to find that my gender identity isn't quite what I thought it was. My gender is nonbinary and genderqueer. I'm not male or female. You may (or may not) have noticed that I've been looking a little different lately. That's what's going on.
&gt;
&gt; The only change that I'm asking from all of you is to use my new pronouns, which are [""they"" / ""them"" / ""their.""](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) I appreciate your understanding with regards to this.
&gt;
&gt; So, at this point, all of you know me at least a little bit, and I hope this doesn't change anything in our working relationship. Also, I'm open to answering any clarifying questions you might have. 
&gt;

I've been questioning my gender for a while now. It started after my best friend came out as genderfluid, and this made me look more critically at my own gender and I've been kinda confused... 

So, I've always been masculine (I'm afab). Even since I was little I always preferred ""boy's"" clothes and interests associated with boys and masculinity. I vaguely remember thinking that I wished I was a boy back then too (although I no longer feel that way now that I know NB genders are a thing) though I think that was because I didn't like the things usually associated with girls, or act ""like a girl"". I had very long hair until two years ago and I always hated it so after I cut it was much happier and more confident in my appearance because I looked more like how I envisioned myself. 

During puberty I hated having boobs. I tried to ignore it but I could only do that so long. When my mum took me bra shopping for the first time I just started crying afterwards. Like, proper sobbing. These days I'm more comfortable with my chest but there are days when I wish it was flat, and I'm only comfortable with it when I'm wearing loose fitting shirts - which are the only type I ever wear now. I'm planning on getting a binder at some point. My voice is quite deep for someone who's afab (If anyone has played Batman: Arkham Asylum, I can reach Batman's pitch fairly easily) which I really like. I used to dislike having a deeper voice than other girls but I've grown to really enjoy it because I feel like it suits me more. I still find myself wishing I had a more masculine figure however. 

There's days when I identify a lot with being a woman and days when I feel weird about the term being used to refer to me. I don't feel like a man, just really masculine or somewhere in between when I'm not feeling so much like a woman on those days. I'm cool with most pronouns being used and when people mistake me for a boy I'm not too bothered by it, and if I confuse them about my gender then that's perfect. I really like looking androgynous most days. Sometimes not, but most days I do. Sometimes when I've had to count how many girls are, say, going to a friends house, I'd be like ""oh yeah, I'm a girl"". Like I forget that other people consider me a girl and would count me as such?

I've heard the term demigirl - or demigender - and I think it maybe fits but I'm not sure.

35,2017-04-07 06:28:54,63yrbd,10,20,"Big frustrated 2:30 AM rant ahead. Sorry.

Honestly, using the ""kids nowadays"" thing might not make sense given my age (I'll be 18 on Sunday), but take into account the fact that I grew up in a super rural, intensely religious area in western NC. For example: The first time I used the internet was when I was in sixth grade, and it was at the one computer in the library that had the AR tests on it. I didn't use the internet for personal use until I was in high school. I pretty much spent most of my youth, internet-wise, in the equivalent of the early early early internet days.

Anyway, here's my point:  
I'm super fucking envious of all the resources that gender non-conforming youth have now that I never really did. Due to lack of exposure, I didn't even know being transgender was a *thing* until Caitlyn, *and I'm NB trans*. Just taking YouTubers into account, there's Tyler Oakley, Hannah Hart, Skylar Kergil, Jamie Raines, Miles McKenna, and oodles more. People the same age and older than me got to see these people, learn that the way they were was okay, maybe even find support and get on androgen blockers or present as their preferred gender without fear of retaliation from their family. Hell, since was stuck in a fucking time loop for most of my childhood (to the point where I only knew LGB existed and hadn't even heard the acromym), I just chalked up the dysphoria and the lack of sexual interest in others (both of which were and are signs of my asexuality and transness) to, respectively: the idea that, since I was more comfortable hanging with girls, I naturally emulated them to a degree; and me just being a ""late bloomer"" (TMI: this caused me to be sexual with people I really am not a fan of even platonically out of the hopes that I'd ""kickstart"" my sexuality).

I don't really know what the point of this post is. Hell, since 80% of the US lives in urban areas and most of Reddit is late teens/early twenties, most of you guys probably won't even be able to sympathize with this because you *did* have internet access and the like growing up. Idk. It just feels like being rural, poor, and queer isn't really noticed. It's not like it's an active ignorance, it's just that we're *far* from a majority even in the LGBT+ community.

Honestly, it's gotten to the point development wise that I'm debating whether or not getting HRT is even worth it. I look *way* too much like my sex for there to be any doubt ever what I was born as unless I undergo some serious surgery, but even then what's the point? Ugh. Idk.

I found out I wanted to kiss girls and thought that must be why. But it didn't make everything make sense. 

I have not begun HRT and don't know that I will. I have not had any SRS. 

I started reading about gender / trans stuff when I was 18. My girlfriend at the time had CAH, a form of intersex, and the way she talked about gender made me realize that there was more than being a boy or a girl. I ID'd as genderqueer and trans* and, orientation, as bisexual or queer. 

I do not have significant body dysphoria. Not coincidentally Idon't think, my body is tall and flat chested. I do not hate my vagina or my small breasts. My face is feminine but has the capacity for androgyny. If I could be read as perfectly androgynous and gendered male, female, and non-binary equally, I would be so happy. I am always read as female. I am annoyed but resigned about this. 

I am in a long term relationship with a man who is trans, and somewhat, usually privately, gender nonconforming. He has always known I am genderfluid. My gender feels at core neither male nor female, but is somewhat reactive to the gender of the person I am with romantically or sexually. Somewhat ironically for how much I am sexually attracted to queerness, I tend to feel ""girly"" when I'm with my boyfriend, and more ""boy-y"" when I'm with my female sweetheart (polyamorous woo!).

""Feeling like a girl"" and ""feeling like a boy"" feel exactly as genuine to me -- that is to say, both feel thrillingly performative but not insincere. Because of my physiology and gender expression, as I generally wear clothing that is gendered as ""for women"", I am read as a cis woman pretty much all the time. 

I don't think that it hurts me when I am misgendered/limitedly gendered as ""she"". It feels wrong, but not entirely wrong. Recently I have asked my close ones to use they/them/their pronouns with me, which feels more right, but something is still off. (Very rarely do people refer to me as he/him/his; whenever it happens I am thrilled, but I believe that if it were to happen as consistently as she/her/hers does, I would feel similarly: ""not quite right, yo, but I guess close enough."")

I recently described myself as non-binary and trans (I'm 31 now) and my boyfriend was not having it. Because I am gender fluid, AFAB, and ""enough of a girl"" that she/her/hers pronouns from stranger/those not close to me don't cause me severe pain, just a little itchiness, it was not how he perceives non-binary and trans. I feel like since my default gender is NOT female or male and that she/her/hers are not my ideal pronouns, I am not appropriating trans or non-binary identity when I use these words. We are both worried about impact more than intent -- if a cis person learns that I consider myself trans, but knows/assumes that I am AFAB and has not heard me request pronouns other than she/her/hers, that cis person is far more likely to misgender non-binary people in particular, but potentially binary trans people as well.

So I posted something similar to this in FTM, and I was hoping to get a broad range of answers if possible to find out what is the most applicable to me.

See I've recently come to accept that I am indeed Gender fluid and that it has nothing to do with my childhood trauma that I experienced. 

The most confusing thing for me, I feel mainly cause of how I was raised, is I feel like I have no idea what to do when I have days where I feel that I am either agender, or bigender. Like what to wear and how to be, if that makes sense. I was always uncomfortable with those days growing up and I would have massive bouts of anxiety and the like where I wouldn't leave the house and stay in sweat pants and an oversized hoodie. But I want to be able to be my authentic self. I just am currently unsure and I'm looking for ideas. See, the other compounding factor is that I am on the masculine spectrum where when I ID as female I am frequently wearing more masculine clothing, though form fitted. 

I just am looking for advice as to what other people may or may not do when/if they are agender or bigender.

I dunno if it's because I'm interested in reading about many gender identities that it's so hard for me to describe what I feel, as a nanoboy, schrödinboy, agender, genderfluid, I can't f-ing tell, but I can clearly tell that 1) being viewed as a boy makes me feel uncomfortable, and 2) I'm not a girl. I'm AMAB and I don't dress ambiguously... I mean, I don't really care for what I wear as long as it minimized how much I sweat and keeps disease-transmitting mosquitoes from biting my legs - they mostly fly low. So probably everyone else can think I'm a cis boy unless they objectively ask me how I identify myself - to which the honest answer is ""IDK.""
The times I doubt of my so-called male identity are the times I'm being the most social with the most people at once, i.e. at a family meeting or party, since I'm not really that social. I may feel weird at times for going into the boys room, but I'm used to it by now; but I felt really out of place once I went to the male WC while traveling with my family and that whole day I felt more and more disconnected from ""being a boy.""
My first thought was that I might me agender, but that'd be easier to accept solely because I'm also asexual and aromantic, and I ave created an agender character for a comic I'm working on, but it doesn't really seem to represent me.
I have thought in the past I might be pangender. Experiencing multiple genders, in this case all genders, at once is an easy concept for me to assimilate, and I find it annoying when people limitate what I could feel - why does my mom think my cousin might be trans becuase he's into crossdressing and drag, but she doesn't notice her own son doesn't enjoy being called a ""real man?"" Is that so unquestionable that I can't feel something else than being a boy?
But I didn't get that ""that's so me"" feeling about pangender as I did when I accepted my asexuality and aromanticity (or aromanticism, if you will).
I have read about greygender, because it seemed like me at first sight, but not really when I did some further research. I have then reached cassgender (did I spell it correctly?), as in someone whose gender identity is described as not caring about their own gender in their life. And one of the people who were writing about it said they also thought they might be pangender before, do I felt closer to that.
I have recently found out I'm an aspie - i.e. in the autism spectrum, so I'd be interested in knowing more about some neurogenders.

Thing is, I still feel very comfortable being referred to with he/him pronouns as well. I play interstitial music at an open mic comedy show, and I always feel really great when the comedians refer to me as ""Music Man,"" among other things.

I've been pondering my gender for a while, and while I recognized a great deal of femininity in myself, the thought of me being referred to with she/her/hers pronouns full-time didn't seem quite right even though I enjoyed it, while they/them/theirs pronouns always felt off.

I'll be honest, I'm not really sure what do I hope to archieve with this, but I guess I can't lose anything at trying... also forgive my english if there's something that sounds weird (Venezuelan)

I'm a 25 years old guy who wants to be a woman, struggling with therapists because I believe that everything they believe is a lie. Also living in a country were it was thought as a great idea to put a Bus Driver as President.

My mother told me: ""I believe these features socialy called /femenine/ and /masculine/ exist within you at a complete balance. In such a way that you can't notice them as two different things, or you can't notice them at all. You have an incapacity to see gender, like if you were born without being able to.""

My father on the other side, can't understand the fact that I'm attracted to women. For him (and many) is common belief that what a transgender wants to archieve, is having a more comfortable homosexual life, so ""if you're not gay, then why?"", but as much as he doesn't get it, he unconditionally supports me (and is paying for everything)

So, yeah.. those are two things that many can only dream about, the understanding from your mother, and not-as-much but unconditional support from your father. Don't get me wrong, I'm really grateful for that, but... I should start from the beginning: 

Ever since I was a boy, I never understood these ""Girly things"", ""Boy things"", nor the intensity which people divided themselves by such trivialities. As I grew older I could only assumed that people loved to search for excuses to justify this concept called ""Gender"". And I really began to hate it, and everything gender-related.

As I grew even older, I let myself see other side of it. History + Social Media + Social Indoctrination traditionaly given by our parents, and their parents to them = Gender is not even there, not outside the conceptual plane, not outside people thoughts... ""Gender doesn't exist"" was the best closure I found.

For me, the difference between men and women, it's a ""wo"" ......nope I know, I was starting to feel that I was being really heavy/intense in my own anti-gender way, so wanted to make a really bad joke. (The intensity will keep rising tho.) *it's pure anatomy. It is hard for me to believe or understand that there is such thing as ""Feeling like a woman"", if not even women themselves fulfill the norm at 100%. 

It is easier for me to believe that people are victims of an ancient brain wash. And I'm really sorry if that offends someone, I don't believe myself to be better than others, I'd really love to explain why I'm immune, like a recipe ""Drink this and you won't be able to see gender anymore"" really I'd love to, but I can't.

Having said all that, my problem starts when I say ""I want to be a woman"". What I want is a change of ""case"", because what are our bodies if not ""vessels"" for our souls? (or ""Essence"", how I like to call it) I have quite defined what changes I want in my body, body which I was never comfortable with, and always found comfort/envy with the one of a woman. And actually, for better or worse, after years of building piece by piece the body I wish for, it fits 100% with ""Female Anatomy"". 

I know what I want, my parents knows, my dog knows, my friends knows.. everyone supports me, some better than others, but I have full support on my social environment. So what stops me? That I can't turn into a woman by myself, if we could, this thread wouldn't even exist.

So, I found out about a Medical Team that treats trans people (The only one in my country). I called them on January 9th, and I've been seeing them since then. I wanted them to help me to start my HRT, but I was a naive genderblind genderqueer/agender that always had found support from friend an family, what could possibly go wrong? :D(?)

I must rewind a bit, because I did took therapy with a psychologist for year and a half (She is Pure Love), and she never faced me with  ""No you don't"" nor she ever thought I was crazy or anything. She was the one who gave me number of this Team ""For when you want to make the next step"". Also, I had to stop the therapies because she gave birth, nowadays she's so busy as a Mom and still can't return to work because of that.

At that moment what stopped me was that neither of my parents knew. I wanted to call after I passed those Final Bosses, as I thought of them, like ""Once I defeat them (have them on my side) nothing else matters"". So yes, it was January 5th when I talked with my father, and everything went soomthly. I only waited a few days because 9th was the first working monday of the year.

Back to the Medical Team. This is... quite long as it is, but we are now at the climax. I'll try to go directly to facts.

- The Director recieved me, and we talked for about 4 hours, highly understanding me.
- At his order, I had some blood exams and asked my former psychologist for a report.
- Once I got those things, (also by his order) I went to see the one in charge of hormones, Dr.Cabeza 'e Ñame (""Head of Yam"", that's how my friends calls him, don't ask me how Yam is an insult, venezuelan slang)
- After a few sessions with Cabeza 'e Ñame, he asks:""But, what are you doing here?"" (Meaning: at his office.) 
- Meaning: He never understood a thing about me, he thought I was crazy, he actually acknowledged it once
- I never want to see Cabeza 'e Ñame again in my life. And I went to talk with the Director about it, again hours talking.
- He told me not to worry, that he was going to speak with him, that Cabeza 'e Ñame WILL help me.
- So I waited, but got dates cancelled because of reasons.
- In the wait (about weeks) I couldn't help to think about my humiliating experiences with him, and I began to hate him and more every day that passed. ""So what? When the time comes, and I go to see him again... will I gave him a smile? or I would scream the **** out of him? What's the point of this wait?""
- Also I found out that Cabeza 'e Ñame was going to take Ñame Vacations the whole month of April, so my wait was going to wait until May :D
- I went to talk with the Director again, not a happy talk. ""I regret having met you all"" I said. (Which was sad, because the Director is nice :c)
- But then, the Director decided to take a leap of faith, and went outside protocols.
- ""Forget Cabeza e' Ñame, you will meet with our psychologist for psychological support, but I'll send you to another endocrine who will start your HRT immediately""
- So I did, I've seen the psychologist twice, who is a more understanding person, and the endocrine indeed gave me, not a dose, but a prescription of hormones to search and hoping to gather up to 3-4 months.
- Once I gather it, I'll meet again with the endocrine, so I can finally begin my HRT.

The thing is, I'm not quite happy, I feel really weird, it's like a bitter victory. For two reasons:

1. There's a factor that you can't really understand if you don't live here. In Venezuela we have shortage of everything, I've found blockers, but it seems hormones are not found anywhere.. just as you don't always find bread, eggs, milk, sugar, etc. at the markets. I haven't lose hope, as we have holiday the whole week because of Christ (Yes, the whole week) So next week I'll keep searching. And I have family/friends on USA and Europe, who I guess could help, I do have a prescription after all.

2. The thing that more worries me, is that both psychologist and endocrine, are waiting/expecting/asking for me to talk ""femenine"" or express myself other ways, more like a woman. And I'm not looking to train myself to fit into society, I'm ""me"". And /me/ thinks of pronouns like just grammar, I'm not a woman yet so I don't want to be ""she"", and again, my family and friends are with me, they won't call me ""she"" until the time is right. It seems all trans that this Team have treated are binary to the core, and had followed that training even without being asked to. So it's all they know, there is A and B, not C allowed, which are you? The Director seems to be more open about it, but this protocol is a complete mess.

Like I said, I'm not sure why I'm telling my story, nor I dunno how many will actually read it. This was by no means written in order to harm anyone (Only Cabeza e' Ñame), so I apologize if /you/ who read this, are criticized or offended by my words. Please feel free to comment whatever you want. 

I do wonder, does it works like this in every place on Earth? There are actual medical teams that support Non-Binary? I might be wrong, but: it seems to me that Binary Trans have it more easy, ""I'm a woman trapped in the body of a man"" and you're ready.. I just can't understand how every trans (at least treated with this Team) wants to sit the same specific way, or talk the same, or dress the same, how about inviduality?

In Venezuela we have shortage of everything, I\'ve found blockers, but it seems hormones are not found anywhere.. just as you don\'t always find bread, eggs, milk, sugar, etc. at the markets. I haven\'t lose hope, as we have holiday the whole week because of Christ (Yes, the whole week) So next week I\'ll keep searching. And I have family/friends on USA and Europe, who I guess could help, I do have a prescription after all.\n\n2. The thing that more worries me, is that both psychologist and endocrine, are waiting/expecting/asking for me to talk ""femenine"" or express myself other ways, more like a woman. And I\'m not looking to train myself to fit into society, I\'m ""me"". And /me/ thinks of pronouns like just grammar, I\'m not a woman yet so I don\'t want to be ""she"", and again, my family and friends are with me, they won\'t call me ""she"" until the time is right. It seems all trans that this Team have treated are binary to the core, and had followed that training even without being asked to. So it\'s all they know, there is A and B, not C allowed, which are you? The Director seems to be more open about it, but this protocol is a complete mess.\n\nLike I said, I\'m not sure why I\'m telling my story, nor I dunno how many will actually read it. This was by no means written in order to harm anyone (Only Cabeza e\' Ñame), so I apologize if /you/ who read this, are criticized or offended by my words. Please feel free to comment whatever you want. \n\nI do wonder, does it works like this in every place on Earth? There are actual medical teams that support Non-Binary? I might be wrong, but: it seems to me that Binary Trans have it more easy, ""I\'m a woman trapped in the body of a man"" and you\'re ready.. I just can\'t understand how every trans (at least treated with this Team) wants to sit the same specific way, or talk the same, or dress the same, how about inviduality?

And I haven't really gotten any closer to the answer. It's wearing me the hell out.

I've been identifying as non-binary for years now, and until that point where I started being more active in the reddit trans community, T has never been an option for me. I went through puberty excited about my body showing signs of growing up. My dysphoria, which only really became noticable after I realized I was non-binary, is largely social. The body dysphoria I have is usually based on that. Not ""having breasts is wrong"", but ""having breasts makes people see me as female and that's wrong"". I also don't have a very curvy body in general.

I don't know what changed. Maybe it's that I started looking more at transition timelines, experiences, and images of binary trans men. Maybe I've been internalizing some notion that since everyone on reddit is taking hormones, I need to do it too or I'm not really trans. Maybe I'm just some delusional cis girl and I'm taking it to the extreme to get attention. I don't know what it is, but T is suddenly on the forefront of my mind.

I know the changes sound appealing. I know that I've had other qualms with taking masculinizing steps solely for attention, like with cutting my hair, and I'm really happy I did these things after all. I started wearing men's clothes that hide my body shape and it makes me ecstatic, but mostly because it feels like it might make people see me as non-female, or to confuse them about my sex. I've been unable to wear make-up, skirts, or even dress my Animal Crossing character femininely because it makes me so uncomfortable. I also look at some men and know that if pressing that one hypothetical button would make me look like them, I'd instantly press it.

But then there's that other side of me. The side that's scared that my brain sex is female and T will make me depressed. The side that looks at the conventionally masculine, muscular body on the H&amp;M underwear packaging and shudders at the thought of looking like that. The side whose goal was always to be able to look androgynous, female, and male at will, the side that's scared of losing that possibility with T. The side that's scared of hating being called a man and not being able to find a therapist who is knowledgable about NB identities. The side that would do this if the neutral gender marker was introduced in my country but that doesn't have the money to change it twice.

I honestly don't know what to do. I've read the advice that hormones should only be taken if you're sure about them a thousand times... But something about saying ""nope, T is not for me"" makes me anxious. Maybe I just don't feel valid as a trans person if I don't take it... but maybe that's a form of dysphoria in and of itself. My current therapist doesn't know anything about gender and I need her to help with my other mental health issues, so I'm stuck anyway.

I am an AMAB Genderqueer person from Hungary, Europe. I have a very masculine body in which I'm not feeling very comfortable because I think it doesn't reflect my gender identity.

For the past year or so I've been taking progressively more serious steps to have a more androgynous body. I shave all of my body hair and crop my hair very short, almost bald, I'm using women's beauty care products, most importantly moisturizing and skin-softening creams and training my voice to be less deep.

So far, I'm having some limited success, but I think HRT would help a lot in further reaching an androgynous body.

Would you recommend HRT for me or would you be against it? What are your opinions and why?

Another difficulty I have is that in Hungary you have to have a psychiatrist's prescription to get hormones. From chatting with Hungarian trans people, it seems to me that although most psychiatrists here support binary trans people in transitioning, I don't know how they would react to me, who is non-binary and only want hormones to have a less masculine, more androgynous body. I'm afraid they would immediately switch into gatekeeper-mode and deny me their prescription.

102,2017-04-17 02:53:29,65t49k,0,2,"Hey, all. I'm kind of nervous since this is my first post and my first time talking about anything like this, but I really need some help with figuring all of this gender stuff out.

I've had gender issues for most of my life. Even as a little girl, when I presented as very feminine, I found it much more fulfilling to hang with the boys on the playground, and acted as masculine as I could. I never gave much thought to my appearance or felt strange calling myself feminine, though, even until middle school.

Middle school gave rise to the majority of the gender issues. I'm very short and dainty, which I've always liked, but I had to cut my hair into a pixie cut in order to feel capable of facing the world. I figured out I was bi in middle school, had an existential crisis, bought a binder, and started wearing men's clothing on occasion. I never worried about being perceived as too masculine. For a while, I identified as genderfluid. Eventually, however, the phase of masculinity faded, and I gradually gravitated back toward being a cis female. I was comfortable, and forgot about gender almost entirely, dismissing the fluidity as a middle school phase.

I spent two years of high school growing out my hair. When it reached my shoulders, I realized how much I hated it. I had unconsciously started wearing more masculine clothing whilst growing it out, and stopped wearing makeup (though I still very much enjoyed wearing it when I did find time to put some on). I knew immediately that I wanted to cut it all off again, but waited for a few months, wondering if the phase would pass again. It didn't, so I chopped everything off to above my ears. The first time I did it, it was a sense of relief, but this time, there was none. Now I'm wondering whether the cut was a mistake.

Throughout the course of my senior year, I've a) lost weight, and lost some of my curves as a result, b) chopped off my hair, c) quit wearing makeup, for the most part, d) realized I hate shaving, and stopped unless it's necessary (ex: prom is coming up), and e) started singing tenor and alto interchangeably in my school's choir. However, I'm having INTENSE dysphoria. It seems like nothing I do with my body fits.

I'm not a boy. I don't want to be mistaken as such. I've always considered myself to have a feminine identity, but now I'm questioning that. I hate being clean shaven but I also hate my naturally coarse body hair. I want body hair, but I want it to be soft and relatively unnoticeable. I hate my curves, and at the same time, love the way my body looks overall. I hate my low voice and singing tenor, but at the same time, I love it. I have wide shoulders, which I despise. I'm utterly lost and can't seem to find a label that fits. I hate feminine clothing, but I also hate masculine clothing that hides my natural body. I want to look androgynous but am intensely uncomfortable when I do. I don't want my long hair back, but I hate my short hair, and I also don't want no hair. I have awful dysphoria about having a uterus; my external genitalia is fine, and I actually kind of love it, but the internal stuff is horrifying and makes me squeamish thinking about it. Over the past few months, I've talked to my best friend more times than I can count about how much I just want to exist as an incorporeal entity and float around to my classes, so the body issues will go away. 

I seem to swing between feminine and agender or androgynous (I apologize if the terminology is wrong, I haven't done a ton of research yet), and am currently stuck in both simultaneously.

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with the dysphoria for now? For now, all I've found that helps is purple lipstick and longer, more masculine styled shorts.

Any recommendations on what I could do to figure out what gender I could identify with would be welcome, as well.

I'm kind of nervous since this is my first post and my first time talking about anything like this, but I really need some help with figuring all of this gender stuff out.\n\nI've had gender issues for most of my life. Even as a little girl, when I presented as very feminine, I found it much more fulfilling to hang with the boys on the playground, and acted as masculine as I could. I never gave much thought to my appearance or felt strange calling myself feminine, though, even until middle school.\n\nMiddle school gave rise to the majority of the gender issues. I'm very short and dainty, which I've always liked, but I had to cut my hair into a pixie cut in order to feel capable of facing the world. I figured out I was bi in middle school, had an existential crisis, bought a binder, and started wearing men's clothing on occasion. I never worried about being perceived as too masculine. For a while, I identified as genderfluid. Eventually, however, the phase of masculinity faded, and I gradually gravitated back toward being a cis female. I was comfortable, and forgot about gender almost entirely, dismissing the fluidity as a middle school phase.\n\nI spent two years of high school growing out my hair. When it reached my shoulders, I realized how much I hated it. I had unconsciously started wearing more masculine clothing whilst growing it out, and stopped wearing makeup (though I still very much enjoyed wearing it when I did find time to put some on). I knew immediately that I wanted to cut it all off again, but waited for a few months, wondering if the phase would pass again. It didn't, so I chopped everything off to above my ears. The first time I did it, it was a sense of relief, but this time, there was none. Now I'm wondering whether the cut was a mistake.\n\nThroughout the course of my senior year, I've a) lost weight, and lost some of my curves as a result, b) chopped off my hair, c) quit wearing makeup, for the most part, d) realized I hate shaving, and stopped unless it's necessary (ex: prom is coming up), and e) started singing tenor and alto interchangeably in my school's choir. However, I'm having INTENSE dysphoria. It seems like nothing I do with my body fits.\n\nI'm not a boy. I don't want to be mistaken as such. I've always considered myself to have a feminine identity, but now I'm questioning that. I hate being clean shaven but I also hate my naturally coarse body hair. I want body hair, but I want it to be soft and relatively unnoticeable. I hate my curves, and at the same time, love the way my body looks overall. I hate my low voice and singing tenor, but at the same time, I love it. I have wide shoulders, which I despise. I'm utterly lost and can't seem to find a label that fits. I hate feminine clothing, but I also hate masculine clothing that hides my natural body. I want to look androgynous but am intensely uncomfortable when I do. I don't want my long hair back, but I hate my short hair, and I also don't want no hair. I have awful dysphoria about having a uterus; my external genitalia is fine, and I actually kind of love it, but the internal stuff is horrifying and makes me squeamish thinking about it.

I have never felt that my gender mattered? I don't care if people refer to me as a girl, I wouldn't care if someone called me a boy either. Sometimes when people slip up and call me sir it makes me smile though.

I was really masculine as a child (I pretended to be a boy from ages 5-8) and all the way up to around age 18. I always had short hair, and wore mostly men's clothes. I don't know why I decided to grow my hair out and buy more feminine clothing, but I did.

I don't have dysphoria I dont think? When I was a teen I had some issues with looking feminine and would freak out and shave my head if I thought I looked too girly. That happened about 3 times total. If I could pick though, I would want to look genderless and inhuman. The thought of people looking at me and being confused about my gender makes me really happy. I don't think I have physical dysphoria either, I have body image issues because I have an eating disorder. But I believe that's a separate entity.

I'm into body modification, and plan to become heavily modded in the future, primarily things that make me look more alien (tongue split, maybe a bellybutton removal etc.). But for some reason I have been thinking about gender on and off for the past few years.

I talked to my boyfriend, who told me he assumes I lean towards being NB. Aparently I talk more about wanting to be genderless alien more than I thought.

I don't feel comfortable identifying as non binary though? I don't have much uncomfort with my body, I don't really mind that I'm physically female, I don't have issues with my breasts (they are quite small though) and I wish my hips were less wide, but I'm not like... very upset about it or anything. So I kind of feel like a faker, or just someone who has a bad self worth...

The more I think the more it seems I might not be cis at least? I don't feel like cis people get upset and question their gender for years like I have. But I really just don't know anymore.... I guess I'm just freaking out. I just feel like since i dont have intense dysphoria like my binary trans friends I'm not really nonbinary. Or the fact that i don't want to chop all my hair off, or because most of my clothes are very fem, and i dont get upset when people call me ""she"" ""ma'am"" or ""girl"" (I'm not like happy about it but it doesn't hurt me or anything or make me sad) or because im just afraid I'm just not actually NB and I'm just actually riddled with depression with myself as a whole and it's manifesting as gender confusion. 

I know it's a personal thing and that no one can tell me who i am and what gender i am or how to identify or what pronouns to use. But i just wish someone could just be like ""you're nonbinary"" ""youre agender"" ""no you're actually cis"" because i feel like a chicken running in circles with my head cut off.

I'm sorry, I'm not even sure what I'm trying to get at here. I'm just really confused and conflicted and thought maybe this sub could provide some insight (I'm not close enough to anyone who is nb to talk to).

Even though I only did so to a small group of friends and plan to slowly add more trustworthy people (more on that later). So thought I'd share my experience the last month.


    1. Making the post/reactions

The most stressful part of all was hitting ""post"" and waiting for the responses which I quickly jumped to respond to. I actually posted it twice since the first time nobody said anything but they liked it. Again, everyone was 100% supportive and totally cool with it, and in fact I've become somewhat closer to them.

    2. Expressing myself outside

I experimented with certain clothes and products outside of the safety if my room (nail polish, women's skinny jeans, some makeup) and nobody said a thing or took a second look (it's college so I guess that makes sense). I'm still quite nervous about going out with full outfits and whatnot but taking baby steps is easier.


    3. Harassment 

This is the ""more on that"". About 2/3 weeks ago I got a random text where a person I wasn't out to, found out. All this time later I've gotten numerous texts from different numbers (I'm assuming fake numbers) telling me a whole bunch of stuff ranging from ""die"" to ""I've seen your posts about me on [private instagram]"". I can care less about the insults and what not, my main concern is just finding out who this is. I have different theories but none of them make much sense (I can make another post regarding that if y'all want). It caused a friendship to end. It's hard talking about it to everyone since I'm not out to everyone, and I don't feel comfortable telling the police (although if it gets serious I will). Best bet is change my number for a 2nd time.


    4. It still feels weird...

Even a month after coming out it still feels weird making those posts and sharing the pictures of the genderqueer me. A friend mentioned it's because for all this time it's been a secret so my brain is still used to it like that. Also since coming out I've had less dysphoria, and if I do it comes not as often.

-------------------------------

I still have an interesting journey ahead of me. Next semester I plan on joining my LGBT club at school (I signed up this semester but haven't heard a thing :/), I plan on telling more people (but since #3 I'm going to be very selective), go shopping for more female clothes (because I have one outfit) and start to go out more with friends in my female side once summer break starts and everyone is home.

146,2017-04-24 01:49:12,6767px,0,2,"okay so this is a throwaway account because I frequent the FTM and transgender subs and am afraid of backlash. I am on here as well. but here goes. 

Okay so i began questioning my gender identity about two years ago. I became very anxious, dissociative, and depressed. 
It started really randomly while I was smoking weed. And I just thought.. why do I feel like a dude right now? I'm AFAB. 
anyway I've been basically obsessing  about it for the last two years. literally everyday. all day. I rarely have a normal chain of thought and it's definitely taken a toll. dysphoria for me has gradually worsened over this time.
Anyway I came to the conclusion a couple of times that I'm ftm... while like hoping that I gender queer? if that makes sense. I guess I saw this as an easier route and it seemed to fit my overall personality. I just don't ""feel like a girl"" at all. There were times where I ""felt like a man"" But i don't really have a desire to BE a man. anyway. around that time (2 years ago)  I began referring to most people as human or person without consciously doing so.
 And would probably rather prefer people refer to me as that as well but I appear female so I get called she. 
But also the more I think about it the more i find it strange to address people by their genitals but thats the world we live in.

I also want to note that at one point when talking to my friend about my gender identity issues they pointed out that they could see how a woman would feel FTM when so many things that are considered male are really just human traits. 

I feel it should be noted that I have OCD. Pure Obsessional. Intrusive thoughts basically. I get caught in mental loops of checking and questioning. I've suffered from mostly sexual themes. bestiality, incest, pedophilia, and sexuality, and then seemingly gender identity. (I'm not equating these things i'm just saying they all fall under the same ""theme"")
But I've been actually considering my gender identity as a part of me that could be up for question. do to that ""high thought"" and the fact that I've never fit into any sort of gender stereotype nor did I really ever get along with the ""stereotypical girls"" or fit in, in that space. 
As a child I remember being really excited about my period. I knew it was something that was going to happen and sort of couldn't wait for it to start. I never had issues with my body other than just feeling all around awkward. I feel like i've always just thought of my body as being.
In my teens I really just wanted things I was told I should have to fit into this stereotype of what it means to be female (big boobs, long legs, plump lips). But I always have sort of seen my self as looking very boyish and was deeply upset by this due to the fact that it was 'wrong'. hard to say how I'd feel about it if we lived in a different world. Anyway. I sort of have always thought that I look like a man despite being told that I have a feminine face. similar to what a lot of FTM's feel. (really only like 3 times ever, I don't see why anyone would openly say that i look like a boy unless they were trying to hurt my feelings) . 

Onto my point. I had stopped smoking weed for quite a few months due to it playing on my extreme anxiety. and just the other day smoked for the first time, because I considered myself at ease with my FTM identity even though i'm not out. Because it had been so long I got reeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaallllllllly high. similar to a feeling of tripping on LSD. Anyway I was thinking all these things about society and humans and general and how we are meant to be on the most basic level. we're really strange creatures if you think about it.
 Anyway I came to this point of just feeling totally neutrois. Like yes I have these body parts and they serve functions because that's that just nature. I don't feel like a girl or a boy because what does that even mean? I feel like a human and I like the things that I like. 
Anyway there have been a couple points where I just think about being transgender and I'm like wtf am i even talking about?!?
People have body dymorphia/dysphoria for all sorts of things. Why is gender so different? don't like your boobs? maybe you're just a human who doesn't want boobs but they're there. 
I no longer strive to look ""pretty"" and I don't necessarily want to be handsome I just want to look good in a way that I think good looks. I dont like my name never have. I feel people should be able to be called by whatever name they feel suits them. When I was younger I cried and begged for my name to be something along the lines of Moonbeam or after my favorite cartoon character. I'm considering now going by an androgynous nick name that i feel suits me. 

It just makes me wonder... If any of this is real. like if being trans is real. Is being trans just a fixation that can make you dysphoric? I mean i never experienced a ""phantom limb"" until i read about it. 

I realize people absolutely have a right to do whatever they want with their body. people get plastic surgery, tattoos, piercings, abortions.. I don't have a problem with any of it. just for me it just seems like trans people go to such great extremes. 

just because your AFAB and would like a more muscular looking body or facial hair. does that make you a man?

Iv'e read theories.. that i can agree with as much as i can agree with transitioning that basically state that gender identity issues can have alternative causes and alternative treatments...and i dont mean alternative treatment as in electroshock therapy or anything i just mean there are sometimes underlying causes. I do think it's sort of one sided in the fact that transition is presented as the only treatment.

I know this might get a lot of backlash but hey. it's just  my thoughts.

*edit* TLDR sorta feel like is everyone just neutrois but simply just trying to appear how they feel looks best

181,2017-04-28 04:15:21,680vuu,3,3,"Howdy ya'll!

So I'm new to the forum, but I'm happy to be here. Been lurking a few posts, enjoying the supportive words vicariously.

My main reason for writing is because I feel anxiety reaching out and befriending other nonbinary/genderqueer/genderfluid/etc. humans. I only came to the realization that I was genderqueer last year over the summer, and I've only been brave enough to start voicing my Truth and rocking a more androg aesthetic recently.

Perhaps the main source of my anxiety (aside from the anxiety disorder--that's mayhaps a wee bit of a contributing factor) is dealing with doubts about my own authenticity, which stems from two sources. One, I realized my own genderqueerness four years into a relationship with a cishet man (I'm AFAB); I've already dealt with feelings of erasure for years due to my bi/pansexuality being rendered pretty much invisible under the weight of people assuming our (my) heterosexuality and cisgenderedness.

The other source of my self-doubt my unabashed care for my body. I spent five years overcoming an eating disorder as a teenager because of the beauty standards the Western World applies on AFAB people. After five years of puking and sucking my stomach into my ribcage in the mirror, I'd had enough. It was either learn to love my body just as it is or wind up with permanent psychological wounds. So, I don't want to change my body. I don't even really think I'd go for a binder, as I hate all things confining and tight on my already-bony ribcage (I haven't worn a bra in ~5 years).

I don't doubt my Self, or my identity. I'm pretty strong in those respects. What burdens me is my fear of reaching out to other people like me. I have a few nonbinary friendquaintances in real life (too close to be an acquaintance, not quite friend enough for regular deep, philosophical convos), but I'm afraid of taking it to the next level.

What I really crave are those deep in-person conversations where we are vulnerable with each other and talk about our lives, our experiences, and our hopes. But, yeah, that's something you gotta work up to. If someone tried to have one of those convos with me on the subway? I'd likely wig out and leave--but then again, drifting off topic.

I don't even really think I'd go for a binder, as I hate all things confining and tight on my already-bony ribcage (I haven't worn a bra in ~5 years).\n\nI don't doubt my Self, or my identity. I'm pretty strong in those respects. What burdens me is my fear of reaching out to other people like me. I have a few nonbinary friendquaintances in real life (too close to be an acquaintance, not quite friend enough for regular deep, philosophical convos), but I'm afraid of taking it to the next level.\n\nWhat I really crave are those deep in-person conversations where we are vulnerable with each other and talk about our lives, our experiences, and our hopes. But, yeah, that's something you gotta work up to. If someone tried to have one of those convos with me on the subway? I'd likely wig out and leave--but then again, drifting off topic.\n\nTL;DR I have anxiety--how do I make IRL non-cis friends?"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Lonely GQ in Chicago', 'created': 1493378121.0}"

Anyways, like the title suggests, I'm unsure how to feel. I don't know if I should be male or female, which I suppose is why I chose here to ask about it. Now, the reason I feel this way is because in my appearance, and from what I've been told (and somewhat noticed) in my personality/behavior as well as even my voice.

I already look rather ""feminine"" with a more slender waist, wider hips, and over all ""softer"" features. With my personality, I've been told that my personality and behavior is what is usually considered to be typically more feminine. (Not saying I fully agree with the behavior stereotypes of genders, but a lot of how people say I behave, I do notice in myself.) Now, touching on my voice, it might be a bit weird how something like that could be an issue. But after listening to my own voice, it's a bit weird to explain. While yes it generally deeper, and men's voices do tend to be deeper, it doesn't sound ""masculine."" it also seems to shift pitch much more like a woman's.

Anyways, like I mentioned earlier the reason I'm using an alt-account. Much of my family I'm positive would not be pleased with noticing a post like this from my main account.

This also gives me virtually no-one to talk to, as this is all of my family that I'm really ""close"" to. It's a similar situation with my friends. Only one of them do I believe would be accepting of this, but even then he's terrible at keeping secrets.

Even before I found out about trans/nonbinary identities, I felt like I was different from girls my age. It was this strange, isolating feeling that I could never really place. I felt different from everyone else and I had no idea why. 

Then I heard about transgender people. I wondered if I was FTM. I thought about it a lot. At the time I didn't feel like a girl, but I didn't feel like a boy either. So, I continued identifying as female. Mostly because my family hates transgender people, and I think deep down I wished this was just a phase. I was afraid, so I continued to deny my feelings.

Then I heard about a different gender identity. ""Agender"". It was the first nonbinary identity I heard of. It was exciting, realizing I could be whoever I wanted to. I didn't have to decide if I was a ""boy"" or a ""girl"". So I clung to it. My strategy for awhile was ""just identify as agender, try not to think about it that much."" I didn't know who I was, so I tried not to think about it. I didn't want to think about it. So I tried to slap a label on myself that didn't fit quite right, but I decided it was close enough.

Then I thought about what name I wanted to go by. I tried using some gender neutral names for myself, but none of them felt right. But then I tried going by a masculine name. I don't know why, but it just felt perfect. I also realized I prefer he/he him pronouns. I realized I enjoyed being masculine, so I thought ""Well I guess I'm FTM.""

Then I realized I don't feel male either. And that's pretty much where I am now. All I know is I'm not a girl. But everytime I think about my gender I just get overwhelmed and confused. It feels like no label really fits. Am I male? Am I agender? Am I genderfluid, but my gender identity fluctuates very slowly? Am I a demiboy? Am I nonbinary? I have no clue. I've been questioning my gender identity for about a year now and I'm as unsure as I am when I started.

So waking up and choosing what to wear is very hard and very difficult to deal with. Now, I think what you're thinking, ""Who cares what you wear?! Wear what you like!"" and usually I would listen to that. But remember, this is MY HICK TOWN AND HIGH SCHOOL, so what you wear does really matter. Now personally my two periods (a math block) go by pretty fast but then...PE HAPPENS. Now now, I know none of us socially awkw- I mean beautiful social butterflies like to have p.e. and be sweaty and gross when we could be binging some old 1980's movies. But the worst part is since I was born in a female body, I basically use female everything - changing rooms, bathrooms, shoes, clothes and etc. Anyways, today I was having a very masculine day and since all the stalls were taken, I had to suffer changing in front of all the other females. So usually, this is where my dysphoria triggers and starts going in overdrive. Usually people look at me silently looking down and taking deep breaths and just shrug it off, thinking I just need to calm down from something else that happens. But in mind this is what's happening: OMG EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT YOU, WHY ARE YOU IN HERE, THIS IS MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE BC THEY ALL FEELS GOOD AND SECURE IN THEIR BODIES AND YOU DON'T. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A PENIS, OR BROAD SHOULDERS OR A BUILD THAT'S NEUTRAL/MASCULINE. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE A GIRL AND THAT'S HOW IT WILL ALWAYS BE. should we ask (friend) for hel- NO! CAN'T YOU SEE EVERYONE IS STARING AT YOU AND MAKING JOKES AND DEROGATORY THINGS? GOD SO IGNORANT. And that basically takes place everyday. The worst things I think about being genderfluid is, #1 my breasts. Now I'm not here to brag, they aren't huge but they aren't small either. Some days I absolutely loathe them, I want to rip them off and never see them. Other days, I love them and feel good about them and other days I just don't really care. The other thing that sucks about being genderfluid is...well everything basically. Whatever, message me if you have questions, comments or etc., or don't that's ok.

Wear what you like!"" and usually I would listen to that. But remember, this is MY HICK TOWN AND HIGH SCHOOL, so what you wear does really matter. Now personally my two periods (a math block) go by pretty fast but then...PE HAPPENS. Now now, I know none of us socially awkw- I mean beautiful social butterflies like to have p.e. and be sweaty and gross when we could be binging some old 1980\'s movies. But the worst part is since I was born in a female body, I basically use female everything - changing rooms, bathrooms, shoes, clothes and etc. Anyways, today I was having a very masculine day and since all the stalls were taken, I had to suffer changing in front of all the other females. So usually, this is where my dysphoria triggers and starts going in overdrive. Usually people look at me silently looking down and taking deep breaths and just shrug it off, thinking I just need to calm down from something else that happens. But in mind this is what\'s happening: OMG EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT YOU, WHY ARE YOU IN HERE, THIS IS MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE BC THEY ALL FEELS GOOD AND SECURE IN THEIR BODIES AND YOU DON\'T. YOU\'LL NEVER HAVE A PENIS, OR BROAD SHOULDERS OR A BUILD THAT\'S NEUTRAL/MASCULINE. YOU\'LL ALWAYS BE A GIRL AND THAT\'S HOW IT WILL ALWAYS BE. should we ask (friend) for hel- NO! CAN\'T YOU SEE EVERYONE IS STARING AT YOU AND MAKING JOKES AND DEROGATORY THINGS? GOD SO IGNORANT. And that basically takes place everyday. The worst things I think about being genderfluid is, #1 my breasts. Now I\'m not here to brag, they aren\'t huge but they aren\'t small either. Some days I absolutely loathe them, I want to rip them off and never see them. Other days, I love them and feel good about them and other days I just don\'t really care. The other thing that sucks about being genderfluid is...well everything basically. Whatever, message me if you have questions, comments or etc., or don\'t that\'s ok. Well thanks for being a journal Reddit. Have a good day, stay hydrated. They/Them/Their please. Thanks, Mikey out!', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'being genderfluid in a high school...

I have been reading some similar posts here about this, but I wanted to see what you all thought of my story. I've been living in a world of depression and anxiety in what has been a life-long quest of finding my identity. Before I begin, please understand I've been heavily conditioned by a very conservative society and am new to all this.

I'm 24 years old (Cancer zodiac) biological male and I've always identified using He/him pronouns (I think that's right), just male and that's it and most of my life I tried to adhere to what society dictated was appropriate behavior for a male. I kept trying to be more masculine through Middle School and High School find love (lifting weights, pretending to care about sports and cars, ect) - I've always been a deep romantic, and many girls loved it - they saw me as a Romeo type, but also something deeper within me. They saw I was different than many guys and that I have many (what are said to be) feminine qualities: Compassion, empathy, intuition, vulnerability, sensuality. I enjoyed being submissive too and to be held as much as I held them.

Later on, all of the LGBT stuff started to become more popular, and I began to hear about different gender identities and such. as I said, I am still VERY new to everything - I come from a super conservative group of friends and family (which terrifies me now). 
 But, I've always found myself being jealous of girls and their beauty, and I would always find myself wondering ""If I could be a girl for a day but still be a guy too, that would be awesome!""

Some days at work I will feel very manly, all gruff and mysterious like, and some days I'll be overwhelmed with a super dee duper bouncy happy-go-lucky feminine energy and I'll spend time reading about beauty products, especially hair, and I will often go on shopping sprees for them -  My brother finds it strange I own more beauty products than my sister in law (minus makeup - I tried eyeliner once and the result was frankenstein. Sad day indeedles)

 I also, sometimes cross dress when I feel really feminine. Girl jeans are possibly the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn, and the hoodies...goodness. SO SOFT and often very cute like my stuffed animals, they're cute too... Anyway, um. I haven't slept so sorry if this is all disorganized and a jumble. 

I just see from the comments you all are so nice and helpful and amazing! I just want to make sense of my feelings... and maybe make new friends :)  

Okie! Thanksss :D

Now, I absolutely felt disgusted with me having to do my two dead names (First and Middle name). I looked up the name I had made for myself, I look up ""What is the meaning of 'Mikey'?"". The results were not shocking but it still hurt and got me feeling a certain way. Almost always my name will come up as a version of a boys name. I tried looking in many places for the neutral one or at least a female version, but I found none. Did my name even meaning anything, FOR ME? Who was I if my name couldn't even give me reassurance that it was okay to be me. I looked around at my classmates, different emotions for different names. But they all had one thing in common; they felt safe and secure in their own body, because they are automatically safe and ""normal"" in society. I am not. I started hearing everyone else talk about their names happily, and then I started to freak out. I knew I was having a panic attack. I couldn't stop it, the voices of people were getting louder and they wouldn't stop taunting that they were born with a name that felt right and I wasn't. It starting getting harder and harder to breathe and my vision was failing a bit, Without a word, I took the hall pass and ran into the women's bathroom. I locked myself in a stall and began to cry.

Now looking back, I don't know if it was the pit or my inner flame, I got determined.

21,2017-04-12 08:33:05,64wxiq,6,14,"I feel like such an ass posting this, but I haven't really talked about it with anyone and I just need to be able to explain it to myself.

I'm AFAB, and I've always known my gender wasn't quite right. To me, it almost never felt like I was a ""real girl,"" although that was certainly closer than ""boy."" Even my parents said I should have been a boy. Even the kids at school noticed. And me, I tried to be as girly as fucking possible to be a ""good girl,"" and hated it. I convinced myself I liked it, but it was really just relief from the fear of being identified as a freak.

In high school, a friend of mine came out as trans, first by saying she was ""between genders"" and then by transitioning to living as a woman. When she talked about the ""between genders"" stuff that really resonated me, as did talking with another friend who identified the same way in college, but got relentlessly mocked by our friends in our GSA for being a straight cis guy pretending to be queer. He's out and proud as nonbinary now FWIW. So I always knew I wasn't quite cis, but I treated it as a bad thing. I was a freak. I was a failure.

It was talking to friends online and being lead to Tumblr by them that made me put a name to it, and finally use that name for myself. Nonbinary. Initially I did the research, and I didn't think I was genderqueer. I almost never felt fully like a man, and only infrequently felt fully like a woman. Usually, I felt somewhere in between. Where in between changed from day to day, but I thought that was normal for everyone and every gender experienced a certain amount of fluidity. So I called myself first a demiwoman, and then an femandrogyne. At this point I began to flirt with they pronouns.

Accepting myself as being nonbinary was the best thing in my life. I felt so much better. I didn't feel like a fake all the time. When people misgendered me in public, which happens no matter how I am dressed, even as conforming as possible, it felt ok, or even awesome, instead of like I was a failure or a freak (although I'd still sometimes just be going ""WROOONG"" in my head, that took the bite out of it). My mental health improved leaps and bounds, because I was no longer telling myself every day that I was a failure and a freak. But something was still not right.

I realized that some days a skirt and blouse was right and I liked frills, but some days I just wanted jeans and a video game t-shirt. I realized that some days I loved my breasts and some days I hated them. I realized that some days I looked in the mirror and saw a woman and smiled, and some days I frowned, and same for the days I looked in the mirror and saw a man. And I noticed my pronouns for myself would shift. Some days I realized I was thinking of myself as he, though usually it was she or they.

I'm only out to a handful of people, one of whom is ace and has some other trans and nonbinary friends. We were talking about my nonbinary character's pronouns in a tabletop game we do, and somehow it shifted to talking about my pronouns. I said I don't really know what's right for me and I couldn't ask people to keep up with me, but that I was used to ""she/her"" and most of the time ""they/them"" felt good, but ""he/him"" was too uncommon for me to want someone else to use it unless I had already used it that day. 

I really think I'm genderqueer, but the genders I shift between are rarely the ""binary"" ones.

I would estimate my time spent as various ""genders"" as such:

* 35% - Mostly female, little male
* 30% - Evenly between male and female or totally without (I know, two separate things)
* 24% - Mostly male, little female
* 10% - Pure female
* 1% - Pure Male

In terms of pronouns, I find I usually prefer she, almost always find they acceptable and prefer it much of the time, and find myself using ""he"" maybe one day out of four or five, but like hearing other people say it maybe half that. 

So I guess my question is, is having a ""home gender"" where you usually are valid, and is that still valid if that gender's not a binary one, say, femandrogyne? Am I really genderfluid if I'm shifting between dark and light gray instead of black and white, so to speak?

I said I don\'t really know what\'s right for me and I couldn\'t ask people to keep up with me, but that I was used to ""she/her"" and most of the time ""they/them"" felt good, but ""he/him"" was too uncommon for me to want someone else to use it unless I had already used it that day. \n\nI really think I\'m genderqueer, but the genders I shift between are rarely the ""binary"" ones.\n\nI would estimate my time spent as various ""genders"" as such:\n\n* 35% - Mostly female, little male\n* 30% - Evenly between male and female or totally without (I know, two separate things)\n* 24% - Mostly male, little female\n* 10% - Pure female\n* 1% - Pure Male\n\nIn terms of pronouns, I find I usually prefer she, almost always find they acceptable and prefer it much of the time, and find myself using ""he"" maybe one day out of four or five, but like hearing other people say it maybe half that. \n\nSo I guess my question is, is having a ""home gender"" where you usually are valid, and is that still valid if that gender\'s not a binary one, say, femandrogyne? Am I really genderfluid if I\'m shifting between dark and light gray instead of black and white, so to speak? \n\nThanks for your time, and sorry for yet another identity help post.

38,2017-04-17 19:23:33,65xpyv,3,7,"Hi, all. I'm 19 years old, AFAB, and have been on testosterone for 8 months now. 
When I was first introduced to gender identities other than male or female, I was very put off by it. Gender fluidity especially confused and scared me (and still does). I've usually been comfortable being seen as male, using he/him/his pronouns and having body/facial hair. My whole family and all of my friends have been referring to me as a male for years. I love being on T. 

Here is my dilemma: 
sometimes I don't feel dysphoric or male at all and I don't know what to do during these periods of time. My dysphoria is usually present and I want a male body and use male pronouns and wear male clothes, and then some days, I feel very femme and don't feel like male pronouns fit me quite right and I much prefer they/them/their. It's like my dysphoria lifts away and I feel totally comfortable as a female. I panic so badly because I feel like my whole life has been a lie. 

I thought at first it meant I must've been faking the entire transgender thing and I was really a female all along and in these periods of time, I deeply regret transitioning and wish I had never done it. It keeps me up at night and makes me feel sick with fear and an intense longing to go back in time. 
But, after a week or two, the feeling fades and I'm fine being male again. This has been happening for many years and I've never told anyone because I brushed it off as being a moody teenager or a product of my mental illness. Now, I'm on very good medications and feel amazing but these shifts still happen and it terrifies me.

I've never wanted to question my gender after coming out the first time. The thought of not being binary scares the shit out of me and my friends and family all know me as being openly hateful toward people who identify as such. I feel like the typical ""homophobe bully who turns out to be gay"" trope. 

I never want to stop taking T because I feel so much happier in my body than ever before and my periods of joy last much longer than my periods of regret, but I would really love to experiment more with my pronouns and my clothing. I'm even letting my hair grow out after keeping it short for 7 years. I'm just so afraid and feel like I would be imposing on the people who are just now seeing me as a real male. I just can't ignore these massive dysphoria shifts anymore because it's driving me crazy and making me so anxious.

My questions are: does this sound like gender fluidity? How can I learn to accept this and stop feeling so awful every time I feel femme?

I panic so badly because I feel like my whole life has been a lie. \n\nI thought at first it meant I must\'ve been faking the entire transgender thing and I was really a female all along and in these periods of time, I deeply regret transitioning and wish I had never done it. It keeps me up at night and makes me feel sick with fear and an intense longing to go back in time. \nBut, after a week or two, the feeling fades and I\'m fine being male again. This has been happening for many years and I\'ve never told anyone because I brushed it off as being a moody teenager or a product of my mental illness. Now, I\'m on very good medications and feel amazing but these shifts still happen and it terrifies me.\n\nI\'ve never wanted to question my gender after coming out the first time. The thought of not being binary scares the shit out of me and my friends and family all know me as being openly hateful toward people who identify as such. I feel like the typical ""homophobe bully who turns out to be gay"" trope. \n\nI never want to stop taking T because I feel so much happier in my body than ever before and my periods of joy last much longer than my periods of regret, but I would really love to experiment more with my pronouns and my clothing. I\'m even letting my hair grow out after keeping it short for 7 years. I\'m just so afraid and feel like I would be imposing on the people who are just now seeing me as a real male. I just can\'t ignore these massive dysphoria shifts anymore because it\'s driving me crazy and making me so anxious.\n\nMy questions are: does this sound like gender fluidity? How can I learn to accept this and stop feeling so awful every time I feel femme?\nThanks in advance and sorry about this massive post.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Am I genderfluid?', 'created': 1492482213.0}"

When she feels like a man, she is very dysphoric about her female body and feels a ""phantom"" body (having male genitalia, taller, bigger body) which is very similar to how I feel. When she feels like a woman, she still likes the idea of having a penis but being an extremely feminine man. 

However, she does not want HRT or hormones because she feels like it's unnecessary and that it would only hurt the people she loves anyways.

She still likes the way we have sex (standard heterosexual methods), but I've been letting her express her dominance and masculinity as much as possible... but I feel like after we're calmed down, she feels sad about not being male.

Even though I only did so to a small group of friends and plan to slowly add more trustworthy people (more on that later). So thought I'd share my experience the last month.

    1. Making the post/reactions

The most stressful part of all was hitting ""post"" and waiting for the responses which I quickly jumped to respond to. I actually posted it twice since the first time nobody said anything but they liked it. Again, everyone was 100% supportive and totally cool with it, and in fact I've become somewhat closer to them.

    2. Expressing myself outside

I experimented with certain clothes and products outside of the safety if my room (nail polish, women's skinny jeans, some makeup) and nobody said a thing or took a second look (it's college so I guess that makes sense). I'm still quite nervous about going out with full outfits and whatnot but taking baby steps is easier.

    3. Harassment

This is the ""more on that"". About 2/3 weeks ago I got a random text where a person I wasn't out to, found out. All this time later I've gotten numerous texts from different numbers (I'm assuming fake numbers) telling me a whole bunch of stuff ranging from ""die"" to ""I've seen your posts about me on [private instagram]"". I can care less about the insults and what not, my main concern is just finding out who this is. I have different theories but none of them make much sense (I can make another post regarding that if y'all want). It caused a friendship to end. It's hard talking about it to everyone since I'm not out to everyone, and I don't feel comfortable telling the police (although if it gets serious I will). Best bet is change my number for a 2nd time.

    4. It still feels weird...

Even a month after coming out it still feels weird making those posts and sharing the pictures of the genderqueer me. A friend mentioned it's because for all this time it's been a secret so my brain is still used to it like that. Also since coming out I've had less dysphoria, and if I do it comes not as often.


----------------------
I still have an interesting journey ahead of me. Next semester I plan on joining my LGBT club at school (I signed up this semester but haven't heard a thing :/), I plan on telling more people (but since #3 I'm going to be very selective), go shopping for more female clothes (because I have one outfit) and start to go out more with friends in my female side once summer break starts and everyone is home.

I am 30, AMAB, and I live in (of all places for this) Kentucky. I am not personally responsible for bringing you the train wrecks that are Kim Davis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, or even ""Papa"" John Schnatter, but one day I do hope to, metaphorically or otherwise, kick their asses.

Anyway, I've been out for a few weeks as genderfluid, and if I had to choose, I actually don't... well, I'd choose androgynous. This is all new to me. I feel like myself for the first time since I was a teenager. I'm taking this pretty slow and I do suspect that maybe one day I might want to transition but that scares the hell out of me and I feel like I might be too old for it. But I digress...

Thing is, the questions I'm getting from people are ones I don't really know how to answer. I'm pretty sure you all have had them though, so I thought maybe I'd pass them up the chain and see if you all could help me articulate with words what I can't seem to express myself.

- Isn't 'feeling female' or 'feeling male' itself based in assigned gender roles? Does this not, in and of itself, diminish feminism and your own personal empowerment?

- What is the difference in this and you having a split personality? Are there two of you? Do I need to call a dude in a white jacket with a big net to put you in a hug-me coat to have you--both of you, I mean--put in a room with special walls?

- So is 'gender' a 'feeling' to you? Is it just 'I woke up today feeling like a lady?'

I've tried to explain these points and I'm blue in the face. They mostly get it and mostly support me, which is awesome--especially considering where I live--but there seem to be barriers to understanding that I just can't get through all the way.

I'm so so grateful for the help this subreddit has given me; I've accepted myself as genderfluid and I've even come out to some close friends! Thank you all so much! :)

So I have a few (more) questions, and they're fairly straightforward compared to what I've asked before, so I'll just jump right in

The first one is: Is it normal or unusual to like the idea of a name usually associated with the sex you weren't born as? I'm AMAB, but I like the name Ai, yet I'm not quite willing to give up my birth name and stop going by it. On the other hand though, my birth name is quite masculine and sometimes feels odd. Is this normal or unusual?

The second question is that I want to start presenting as female more, but the two obstacles​ are that my voice is quite deep and my Adam's apple is fairly big. Are there any ways I could train my voice to sound more feminine and hide my Adam's apple?",genderfluid,A few questions,1493441166.0,"{'created_utc': 1493415966, 'id': '685o2q', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 4, 'selftext': ""Hello again everyone! \n\nI'm so so grateful for the help this subreddit has given me; I've accepted myself as genderfluid and I've even come out to some close friends!
