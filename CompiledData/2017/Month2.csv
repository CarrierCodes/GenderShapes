I'm currently writing this post as I feel that I am working through some things but would like some feedback on them. 

To give you some context, I have been questioning my gender (identity and expression) since September last year (2016). It first started with noticing how uncomfortable I was having a feminine gender expression. I forced myself to be somewhat high maintenance. This to me was wearing long weave, doing my nails, wearing makeup, dressing up etc.

Which was nice and sometimes I felt okay. But underneath it all, I had terrible self esteem. I was convinced I was huge in terms of size, felt really self conscious and didn't really see what people saw in me.  I was also diagnosed with body image distortions by a therapist (which I wonder at times if that was actually body dysphoria?).

So I realised how tired I was with how I presented, something was making me tired. I decided to make a decision to not conform to societal norms for women. Something I really advocate. But my questioning and conclusions didn't stop there. 

I dated someone recently, who was transgender. During that time I used to compare myself to them, was really curious about their transition. I watched and researched people who were transgender, thinking I was doing this to be a supportive cis friend. 

However, I subconsciously started to apply these ideas to myself. Would I live as male? Would I identify as male? Which my answer at the time was, ""well, yeah"". That night I concluded that I was a trans guy with little dysphoria. 

Since then, I have been having this constant internal conflict. There's not a day gone by that I don't think about my gender. Am I am a man or a woman. Am I comfortable being perceived as either or both? What kind of discomfort do I have gender wise, and in what ways etc. 

I have since presented more masculine, immediately my being self conscious has reduced somewhat. I now have a healthier relationship with my body, possibly because I contemplated taking testosterone (and still do sometimes). This forced me to contemplate my body a lot. 

I've been researching a lot of gender identities and think that non-binary transmasculine fits me. I feel that my gender identity is mostly neutral but also masculine. In that, I feel I identify as a person (agender) and a guy (male). I have thought about how my personality does not reflect my gender, neither does my gender expression. Despite behaving and dressing more masculine, it feels like something is still missing somehow. 

I constantly have doubts. Am I doing this for attention? Is my depression (which I am getting better with) causing me to want to reinvent myself somehow? Am I doing this to deal with the rejection of a break up for some crazy reason? 

I have these doubts even though I educated myself on the consequences of what this all means, how my life and relationships with people would change if I came out and if I am right about this. 

Any advice would be great, as you know, it is hard sometimes to work through something alone.

I am an afab, visibly feminine person. I don't feel like 'female' fits who I feel I am. I prefer to think of myself as genderless, or just a person, rather than 'female' or 'male'. I've come across the term 'non binary' through research and this really feels like it fits how I feel and think about myself. However everything I've found suggests non binary and trans are the same thing, or are at least very closely related identities. I know I'm not trans, and I know I don't want to transition at all. the only thing I want to do is to start presenting more androgynously, but not inherently masculine (I kind of want to bind to achieve a smaller chest, and dress less feminine, but I don't want to be perceived as a man). I also like using the she/her pronouns and the female name I was given at birth, and think of myself as my partner's girlfriend, and don't want this to change, but I don't know if this makes wanting to look androgynous just a style/aesthetic thing.

25,2017-02-05 07:18:09,5s67q1,0,3,"Hey.

So I've been out as nonbinary (AFAB) for a couple of years now and I still feel so disgusted with myself in so many ways.  My body disgusts me because I hate seeing and feeling the aspects that make me look physically female. So a part of me feels desperate to transition, but people keep saying that I should just do what cis people are encouraged to do and try to accept my body as it is.  And maybe they're right.  I just don't know and it's driving me crazy.  Like, actually crazy.  I have bipolar disorder and every time I start thinking about this stuff I start wanting to kill myself more than usual :/ .  I don't want to grow old feeling like this.

Sometimes I feel like I'm faking it or that I'm not trans enough, but this identity is in my head now and I don't think I can go back to being/wanting to be perceived as a girl.  I wish I could, to be honest.

Also whenever I start a new class at school or meet someone or going to the doctor or anything like that I have to decide whether to use my chosen name or my given name, and it always seems like I'm asking for a favor if I say my chosen name.  Except for close friends I don't tell people what my pronouns are mostly because I'm ashamed/afraid of being  ""needy"" or attention-seeking.

I've avoided talking to the trans people I know irl about this stuff because it seems like I'm supposed to celebrate and accept my identity. But I can't. At all. Basically I wish I'd never figured out that I was anything other than a cis woman.  But there's no going back.

When talking about them, is it considered rude to say him when their pronouns are him/them his/their?

I really don't know, just trying to make it so I don't fuck up talking to them.

An example of this would be like talking to a coworker and saying ""So i met this really nice guy, he's non-binary"" versus ""So I met this really nice person, they're non-binary"" when again, they want to go by he/his/them/their.

65,2017-02-15 21:34:01,5uag2b,6,8,"Hi friends, I think that I'm at the point in my life were I finally admitted to myself that I'm not cis, and theres no way I can live happily pretending to be. But I'm really struggling to figure how I want to identify, because it seems pretty essential to the whole ""coming out and living your dreams"" kinda deal. I'm AMAB and have really never connected with masculinity. Thats not to say that I didn't connect with my male friends, because I did have lots of cis male friends growing up many of whom are still good friends of mine. But masculinity as a whole has always seemed like something I don't want to inhabit, for instance I've had penetrative sex once, and I really didn't like filling that role. Currently my partner is the only one  who knows that I'm gender queer, I dress en femme with her quite frequently and sometimes we even go out and party when I'm dressed up, which always leads to an incredible night for both of us. I think at this point she thinks that I'm a trans woman, I'm not sure she's right, but I'm also definitely not sure she's wrong.

I don't have the worst body dysphoria, I think my issues with my gender is based more off of the way my body causes me to be perceived and therefore how I interact with the world as opposed to how it feels on my body. I've been thinking about coming out as non binary and using they/them/their pronouns, but I kind of want to reach the point where I'm perceived by strangers as female. I think that I still want to take hormones, but use they/them/their pronouns and identify as genderqueer. I've spent so much time and energy trying to end my subscription to masculinity, why would I immediately pick up another subscription?

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of identity? Maybe you thought you were trans at one point but identify as non-binary now or vice versa? Does anyone have any experience taking hormones without identifying as trans? Is it reasonably possible to be prescribed hormones without having horribly crippling body dysphoria?

For those who don't know, neurogenders are genders associated with neurodiversity. These include things like autgender (for autism), bordergender (for BPD), etc.

I noticed some neurogender ppl seem to treat their gender feels like they aren't real. This stems from ableism. Those ppl believe their gender feels are invalid because they're caused by their neurodivergence. This is like saying sensory overload is invalid because it's caused by autism, and ignoring what's actually causing the sensory overload.

If you identify with a neurogender, you shouldn't dismiss your gender feels. Your identity is just as valid as an NT's. Gender is something you feel, and what you feel is perfectly valid. You're allowed to change your life based on how you feel.

If you do decide to transition, please don't feel pressured into doing things you don't want to do. But please do the things you want to do. And remember, transition can be any combination of HRT, surgery, masc/fem clothes, etc, or even just one of those things.

Basically, I've had dysphoria since I hit puberty. But even before that, I was weird about gender. Reading trans stories, I never felt trans, but I wished I was because that would give me a reason to want to get rid of my boobs. I've never liked them, and for the last couple of years I've also wanted HRT. I actually learned of puberty blockers when I was like 15, but I never really asked my mum about them?? I was so depressed already, I think I just thought ""oh, she'd never agree"" then went back to my 24-7 brain fog (not to mention I was already pretty ""developed"" and felt it was too late).

Now I'm 19, and I live with my mum, who makes unintentionally hurtful comments but would never kick me out. I live in Australia, where transition is affordable for me. There's a good-sounding clinic that could be closer, but is reachable. But I'm just too scared to make an appointment? I wish I could just go there once, get a HRT prescription and be done with it. But it requires a GP referral, then several therapist appointments, then blood-work. The sooner I get it started, right? But to get it started I need to call the place, which terrifies me. I keep trying to tell myself it's my subconscious telling me not to transition, but I know it's not true. I'm autistic, I have severe social anxiety, I've had no friends since I was 12. It's the idea of calling.

But I feel like calling would be a mistake? There's all these tiny reasons that add up. Just when I reached 18, I finally liked wearing dresses and stuff (I'm afab). But I'd be too scared to wear them if I looked like a guy. I'm already hairy as fuck and don't want to be hairier, or bald (but I like all the other effects of HRT). I'll spend hours looking at binders online, then chicken out (""I've never bought anything online, and they take so long to ship anyway it's not worth it""). And since 18, I've hated my boobs slightly less. I think I may be genderfluid? Although I only feel like my assigned sex like once every few months, for half a day at best. Mostly I feel neither male or female. I think I'd be okay to pass as a guy, but paradoxically I don't want to bind, even though I want my boobs gone. As my mum's said, I'm a ""pretty girl"" but I'd be a short, ugly guy... which I wouldn't mind if I'm really trans, but what if I'm wrong?

Being trans is also embarrassing! I had the whole ""maybe I'm a trans boy"" convo with her when I was 15, she now knows I'm nonbinary, but I really can't discuss it with her because of the disgusted way she speaks of it. She thinks she's supportive, but her most supportive advice has been ""try dressing as a girl for a year, since you've never really tried being a girl, then try being a boy for a year!"". She's always there for me, but she is the opposite of what I need for trans matters. The idea of trying to talk to any family, or even a stranger who's a doctor is so embarrassing.

I constantly feel like I'm running out of time. I feel the days go by without me while I browse the internet mindlessly, ignoring my problems. I've always ignored problems rather than solved them. I leave work to the last minute. I take literal hours to get out of bed, even after I've woken up. I wish I had gone on HRT younger (all my immediate afab family are tall and big nosed! Not me!)

The idea of all the paperwork of name changes and such exhausts me. I spend hours mindlessly browsing the internet about non-trans things. Then I spend hours reading other trans peoples' stories, or name lists, or binder websites.

Sometimes--indeed, often--I have thoughts along these lines: What clothes would I want to wear if I was a girl? What would my sexuality and sexual preferences be if I was a girl? What surgeries would I want to get if I was a girl? What hairstyle would I want to have if I was a girl? What kinds/styles of makeup would I want to use if I was a girl? Et cetera.

However, in additional to all of these feelings, I also feel very comfortable being a guy; indeed, while I dislike some--indeed, perhaps many--aspects of my body and face (basically, I'd like to andrognize my body and face) as well as male social roles (for instance, I would face the risk of getting beaten up if I will wear a dress or a skirt), I also enjoy living as a guy and all of that--as well as enjoy using male pronouns.

Anyway, could I be gender-fluid? Specifically, are all of these feelings of mine an embodiment of gender-fluidity on my own part?

So firstly I identify as nonbinary currently, AFAB. Sometimes I've questioned if I'm just a trans man in denial. Sometimes I've questioned if I'm cis and confused. It's all so much fun.

One big thing with me is how my dysphoria(?) often changes. I know dysphoria isn't a constant thing with everyone, but the way it expresses itself in my mind changes so much and so extremely it's annoying. 

Many days I feel like I would be fine existing exactly the way I am so long as other people would identify me the way I wish to. Other days I look at myself in the mirror and feel like I'm wearing a costume. It's not a bad costume, it's not a costume I hate at all, but something about my body looks fake. 

I've never really gotten onboard with the whole idea of being a woman who's proud of her body. Thoughts tend to be more like ""this is an attractive body"" rather than ""MY body is beautiful"". Occasionally I cosplay as feminine characters with curvy bodies/big boobs, but my body parts always feel like another part of the costume for me to manipulate. Same when I wear dresses. 

I think sometimes about what I would want to look like under that ""costume"", but looking entirely like a man also doesn't seem right. I really don't know what would look right. Maybe a ken doll body? Or just nothing? 

I never have days where I'm just begging to cut these boobs off me. In fact I'd kinda hate to do that. It would feel like a waste personally. I'm fine with binding them on days when I feel like it. Most of my hurtful dysphoria is social.

16,2017-02-06 22:10:37,5shbi5,15,16,"Hello everyone, 
here is my story, I need some help figuring out what it all means.

I am an 18 year old male. I've always been comfortable being a male. I am by no means the stereotipical boy who likes playing football and cars but I still feel very comfortable being male. I have a wonderful girlfriend which I love very much and it feels natural to be the male partner of the couple. 
Yet I'd also love to be a female. 
Not a mix of the two thing but rather be able to switch between one and the other whenever I feel like it. I would like to be able to wear a dress and high heels like I like to wear a tie for example. 

Very often when I was at home by myself (I don't live there anymore) I would go into my sister's room and dress up as a woman and it felt natural, just like it feels natural to be male.
I would use socks to make the breasts, use a wig, put on a dress that would not show too much of my male body of course and high heels. Whenever I did that, I, for some reason I don't know, got an erection. 

Also I spent hours watching videos of other boys transforming themselves into girls using makeup and other things.

Very often I would also dream about being a female in various occasions. I would also fantasize about it in my head.

What does this mean and what could help me? Is this just attraction to the female side like any heterosexual male is or what is it? I don't feel sexually attracted by other men, I'd just like to be able to be a girl or a boy, whatever I feel like.

I'm too nervous to post in any bigger subreddit, so I was hoping I could reach at least a few people here so I could just connect with some of you who understand what I'm going through.

For the past 18 years (my whole life) I've been living as a guy and for the past 4 years I've been thinking about suicide on a regular basis. I can't remember exactly when all of these feelings really started, but somewhere down the line I realized I wanted to be different. Well, I didn't realize it until high school, but the signs were there. I would dress like a girl when my parents weren't home, I would try on makeup, I would pretend to be a girl online - I did all kinds of things to make myself happy when not much else did. I'm currently living on campus as a first-year university student and I have no idea what to do with my life. I feel a suffocating pressure to come out of the closet before I waste away more of my life, but I have no way of knowing how that will go. My father had told me in the past that he thinks transgender people are ""circus freaks"". How can I possibly face him, or my grandparents, or my friends and tell them this? It's terrifying to even imagine it.

I've considered doing other things like shopping online for clothes that I can wear in private, but even that won't work. I have a roommate sharing this tiny dorm room with me who has no idea that I'm trans. On top of that, I don't have the money to afford clothes on top of school.

I know deep down that the only solution to these problems are to bite the bullet and come out, but it's so hard. It's too hard... I can't stop thinking about my dad's face when he hears about this, or how my brother would react. I can't stop thinking about dedicating so much time and effort into passing as a woman only to have it all fail because of a voice that's too deep or a body that's too masculine. And no matter how many times I tell myself that this is natural and normal, I can't help but see myself as some kind of mistake.

There's so many things that I have to worry about, and life isn't slowing down to let me think through my options with a clear mind. It's so depressing and demoralizing. I've been very depressed recently and I don't really know what I'm looking for with this post... Feeling this way can be very isolating. I feel alone despite having a few cis friends who accept me for who I am. I think about suicide almost every day now, but I don't want to die. I really don't want to die... But right now I'm afraid of living and I'm worried that I'll never be happy in my own skin. I'm worried that I'll never get to be myself. I'm worried that more and more time will pass until I get to the point where my youth is completely spent. I'm scared. 

It's 11:30 PM, I'm crying in bed, and I'm worried that I won't be able to keep this up much longer. Thank you for listening to me, that's really all I've ever wanted.

But cis female isn't right. I'm not ""girly"". At all. I know it's OK for women not to be girly, and they can still be badass women. Your gender is what YOU say it is. If you are cis female, and prefer to wear strictly men's clothing, you can still be cis female. You can be male bodied and the most masculine man on earth, but if you say you are MtF, you are MtF.

The labels aren't the problem. My appearance isn't the problem. My gender identity is.

I am straight. With only 1 exception, I've always been sexually and romantically attracted to men. The one woman was definitely romantic love, but I didn't really desire anything sexual with her. I know gender identity and sexual orientation are mutually exclusive. Hear me out.

When I was younger, from little on, I felt like a boy. I know it's normal for kids to ""try on"" genders, even if they are cis. But now, I'm pretty glad I didn't transition, because I don't want to have gay relationships with gay men. I want to have straight relationships with straight men. But I'm not feminine enough for most straight men. I wouldn't have any issues dating a transman, but I've just never met one I'm attracted to.

I'm not masculine passing and don't try to be, altho it's never bothered me to be ""misgendered"". But I have very short hair, am a jeans and t-shirts kind of person. Little to no makeup. Most people assume I'm lesbian.

I'm fine just being me. But OTOH, I don't know what that exactly is. Or how to properly express it. I don't feel fully female, but I also know I'm not fully male. Given my choice of gender expression, I would feel more comfortable in a tux than a dress. But I would still want people to know I'm not a man.... I don't think. Is that strange? How is it at 40, I still don't know who and what I am? How can I go about figuring it out?

Hi. So..without going into too much detail, I was given the green light to start testosterone last Wednesday, but when I showed up for my appointment, I was informed I would not be getting my prescription because of my congenital heart murmur. 

-I've never been put on any restrictions by my cardiologist.

-I've never passed out etc because of my heart murmur.

-I asked my cardiologist specifically if there would be any conflict with starting hrt and I was given the green light.

When I began going to the doctor at the LGBT center in my area, he asked about my heart murmur. I explained the three points I just listed above. The doctor asked me to sign a release of records form to be faxed over to my cardiologist and for a letter to be faxed over giving me permission to start hrt. I complied and and my cardiologist sent the letter. When I showed up, the doctor sat me down and read the part of the letter that bothered him. Pretty much it said he didn't see anything wrong with me starting T, but he was not aware of any research of patients with heart murmurs starting hrt. In other words, he covered his own ass so he couldn't get sued if  something went wrong. Duh. The doctor had a problem with that because he said that puts all the blame on him if something goes wrong. Now I'm in the middle of this uphill battle where he's getting in contact with my second cardiologist to see if he can get a letter that doesn't absolve the cardiologist of any blame. (Ya. Fat chance. They're not the ones prescribing the T. It's not going to be worded like that.) He has also told me that he will only start me on gel and we'll be going as slow as possible. I understand the reasoning, but I'm not satisfied with that answer. I don't want to go at a snail's pace. I've waited long enough for this and there is no conflict with T and this heart murmur. 

Does anyone else have experience getting T with a congenital heart murmur? What dosage were you started on and did anything tragic happen? I need examples so that if I have to argue my way into a prescription I have some facts to go on. Thanks.

The doctor had a problem with that because he said that puts all the blame on him if something goes wrong. Now I'm in the middle of this uphill battle where he's getting in contact with my second cardiologist to see if he can get a letter that doesn't absolve the cardiologist of any blame. (Ya. Fat chance. They're not the ones prescribing the T. It's not going to be worded like that.) He has also told me that he will only start me on gel and we'll be going as slow as possible. I understand the reasoning, but I'm not satisfied with that answer. I don't want to go at a snail's pace. I've waited long enough for this and there is no conflict with T and this heart murmur. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience getting T with a congenital heart murmur? What dosage were you started on and did anything tragic happen? I need examples so that if I have to argue my way into a prescription I have some facts to go on.

Only to find out after more research that the condition didn't quite fit. 

Recently I've been reading about dissociative disorders and I really feel like that might be what it is that's been wrong with me my whole life. 

Shortly after I graduated high-school (8 years ago) I heard about transgenderism for the first time and it was like an explosion went off in my head.

Since then I've slowly started to explore that part of myself and I'm certain, more certain than about anything else in my life, that I want to transition.

But here's the problem. In order to know for sure if I have a dissociative disorder I'll have to discuss it with my doctor. I've mentioned a couple of times to her that I want to transition but she never asks me about it. I'm worried that if I ask her about dissociative disorders it will invalidate, in her mind, the dysphoria I'm feeling and it will ultimately stall the process of transitioning. What's making me even more worried is that this might turn out just like every other time I've thought I'd figured out what was wrong with me and not only would I be stalling the process but now she'd question everything else I told her because I was wrong about this.

I am a 26 year old biological male and have been battling gender dysphoria in various stages of denial for my whole life.  When I was younger, and through highschool transitioning was never a legitimate possibility in my mind but I always knew something was off, especially during puberty.  The changes to my body caught me very off guard and I was particularly sensitive about my height (Ive always been the tallest in my classes and have been about 6'4"" since I was 15).  Much to my chagrin, my height seems to be my defining characteristic and for this and other reasons I wouldn't admit (even to myself) what the cause of my drastic mood swings that eventually led to a brief stint in a mental hospital.  I kept insisting that ""my brain wasn't balanced"" and tried to place my faith in western antipsychotics.  Years of these turned out to not be the solution I was looking for and I weened myself off by the time I was about 21.  


I think it may have been my experimentation with psychedelics that showed me a different framework that was always there but deeply buried and Ive gradually been coming to terms with the fact that I am at least not a male in the traditional sense.  For 5 years I've gone through many periods of buying women's clothing and makeup and trying to explore this other side of myself only to bury it all back in the closet when the realization that a transition just doesn't seem logistically feasible and I would probably end up drawing a lot of negative attention to myself that I am not sure if I would be able to handle (I am very shy and usually like to keep a low profile).


I am scared about what I know about myself now because I feel simultaneously more liberated and more trapped than I have ever felt before.


For fear of a wall of text, Ive only provided a basic outline but would love to elaborate.

Today I decided to go back through all of my old journals, because I'm noticing how much emotional trauma from my past is a direct result of my dysphoria. I found this blog post of mine from 2011 which knocked me on my ass.

&gt;  Had a dream last night that I killed someone. I hung her. Stuffed the body in a black garbage bag and stuffed it into a closet with intention of digging it up and burying it in the desert later. We were at some kind of party, and I had to rejoin the group and act normal.
&gt; 
&gt;  I could barely walk, I was so nervous. It took every ounce of my strength to keep my composure, but I did it and I did it damn well. I thought I was doing great, until someone mentioned they had lost something. They decided to go upstairs and look for it. In the room where I had hidden the body. I sipped my drink and waited. Then she screamed. She had found it. Within minutes, the police were swarming the crime scene. They had sprawled the body out on the bed and were peeling apart the separate elements and separating them into evidence piles.
&gt; 
&gt;  I lost it. I was convinced that they were going to catch me; that they would be able to extract my DNA from the rope around her neck or find my sweat on the garbage. My typically logical and level-headed mind ran rampant with wild ideas and accusations. Nevertheless, I left. I got in my car and drove down the empty road in the middle of the desert, with that heavy and desperately uncomfortable feeling that I was being hunted.

&gt;  I’ve been up for two hours. It still feels like they’re coming for me.

&gt;  I’ve always felt my dreams were symbolic. So what the hell does that unbelievably disturbing dream mean? Who did I kill, and how could I have possibly MURDERED someone? Why did I hide her in a closet? Why was it so sudden? What did the desert mean?
&gt; 
&gt;  And why, in the waking world, am I still looking over my shoulder and listening for sirens?

My wife and I were almost laughing at how on-the-nose it sounds. I'm literally describing a girl I killed and hid in a closet, the fear of being found out, and choosing the nothingness of the desert over facing the body and consequences I left behind, like choosing to pretend to live as a male in an empty existence rather than embracing the real me. This comes after all of these realizations that all my life I've tried my hardest to extinguish any kind of femininity in my appearance and behavior, to fit the definition of ""man"" I was expected to embody.

Not sure why I'm posting this. I'm still just stunned, but this old post is one of the most powerful bits of evidence I've found that I am trans, and have been the whole time. That's still... really difficult for me to say.

I have made the choice at this point in my job lyf to not correct families or make explicit what pronouns they should be using for me. Thus about once a month i get the ""What are you? Are you a man or women?/etc"" from some child, and usually with their family in the room.

""I am neither a man or a women."" (This I use less often partly out of internalized fear how the family will respond) 
Or I try to divert the conversation in some way.

8,2017-02-02 06:51:18,5rlbnv,24,8,"I never really cared about clothing or fashion before, but now I am starting to be more interested in slimmer tighter clothing and lighter colors which are typically for women's clothing only. I noticed a lot of men's clothing is loose, baggy and bulky. In some cases its not even as warm. I actually have plenty of clothes but I don't really like them anymore since they are mostly too loose or too big. My experience with women's clothes is rather limited right now I am really into Uniqlo so I will use that as an example. I have heattech turtleneck shirts in mens and womens in medium size, the womens shirt is noticeably much smaller (and shorter) but a nice snug fit maybe I could have gone with men's small instead. And I also have the heattech mens and women's long johns and leggings in medium. Oddly enough the leggings is actually bigger than the long johns in every way, longer, wider, and looser. Which puzzles me because the waist measurement on their website says men's medium is 30-33 inch waist, women's medium is 28-29 inch waist, yet the women's leggings waistline is actually bigger. those are two specific examples but it seems I would have to size up for tops, and size down for bottoms? I don't think I need another jacket but this one looks very appealing. it's slim, has a neckguard, and cute furry hood.

https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women-lightweight-down-hooded-coat-178934.html

Do I just go inside the store and see if I can fit in one? I am already getting grief for wearing the long johns and leggings. my family doesn't know the leggings are for women, but their complaint is my pants are too tight. and tell me to cover up with looser pants. But they also complain about my beard. it seems their standards for male appearance is very narrow.

Right now I mostly order stuff online because Uniqlo is far from me but also because I feel embarrassed browsing in the women's section let alone trying the clothes on! I don't even like wearing jeans but suddenly have the urge to get the skintight women's jeans. Men's tapered jeans don't even look tight enough. I did order a pair of jeggings medium size. I assume it will have same fit as the heattech leggings. but for actual jeans I would have to go in the store to find out my size. But no rush since that would be summer clothes. There is a gap nearby but seems pricy. and there is a kohls and numerous discount clothing stores but I am afraid that clothing is too low quality? And oops looks like I wrote way too much.

Update: I went and tried on some women's skinny jeans at GAP and Marshall's. GAP there was like 5 customers must be the high prices got 2 jeans for 50% off (Well buy 1 and get 1 free). only tried the women's stretch skinny jeans at GAP. I noticed one woman stopped walking and turned around to stare at me browsing the women's jeans section. That made me a little nervous. The fitting room attendant probably didn't notice what kind of jeans I was holding. Staff was nice. Then for Marshall's I grabbed a bunch of jeans of different genders, colors, sizes and brands. All skinny, except one was straight. I was way more nervous this time because the store was packed with customers. There were women standing next to me looking at the skinny jeans I was looking at. I did not notice anyone staring at me though. The fitting room attendant had to count how many clothes I had to give me a number badge. I doubt she did not notice I was holding mostly women jeans well she did not say anything. Levi's mens jeans was way too tight could not even pull up the zipper. I tried size 29 and 31. women's calvin klein size 6 was a snug fit, anne klein (any relation lol?) size 4, 10 both fit. The size 4 felt like the calvin klein size 6, I suspect the anne klein has some vanity sizing. there was a size 10 anne klein straight fit, and it looked like regular men's slim fit with some baggage. I should have tried size 8, but size 10 was pretty good but a little loose. ended up with the anne klein skinny jeans, $25 each. They are a little looser than the gap jeans I bought, but not nearly as loose as my size 33 uniqlo pants (I later read online that uniqlo pants have huge waists) I don't understand how I could fit into size 4 women's skinny jeans but couldn't fit size 31 men's skinny jeans. maybe just a combination of levis men sizes run smaller and anne klein runs bigger?

I noticed a lot of men\'s clothing is loose, baggy and bulky. In some cases its not even as warm. I actually have plenty of clothes but I don\'t really like them anymore since they are mostly too loose or too big. My experience with women\'s clothes is rather limited right now I am really into Uniqlo so I will use that as an example. I have heattech turtleneck shirts in mens and womens in medium size, the womens shirt is noticeably much smaller (and shorter) but a nice snug fit maybe I could have gone with men\'s small instead. And I also have the heattech mens and women\'s long johns and leggings in medium. Oddly enough the leggings is actually bigger than the long johns in every way, longer, wider, and looser. Which puzzles me because the waist measurement on their website says men\'s medium is 30-33 inch waist, women\'s medium is 28-29 inch waist, yet the women\'s leggings waistline is actually bigger. those are two specific examples but it seems I would have to size up for tops, and size down for bottoms? I don\'t think I need another jacket but this one looks very appealing. it\'s slim, has a neckguard, and cute furry hood.\n\nhttps://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women-lightweight-down-hooded-coat-178934.html\n\nDo I just go inside the store and see if I can fit in one? I am already getting grief for wearing the long johns and leggings. my family doesn\'t know the leggings are for women, but their complaint is my pants are too tight. and tell me to cover up with looser pants. But they also complain about my beard. it seems their standards for male appearance is very narrow.\n\nRight now I mostly order stuff online because Uniqlo is far from me but also because I feel embarrassed browsing in the women\'s section let alone trying the clothes on! I don\'t even like wearing jeans but suddenly have the urge to get the skintight women\'s jeans. Men\'s tapered jeans don\'t even look tight enough. I did order a pair of jeggings medium size. I assume it will have same fit as the heattech leggings. but for actual jeans I would have to go in the store to find out my size. But no rush since that would be summer clothes. There is a gap nearby but seems pricy. and there is a kohls and numerous discount clothing stores but I am afraid that clothing is too low quality? And oops looks like I wrote way too much.\n\nUpdate: I went and tried on some women\'s skinny jeans at GAP and Marshall\'s. GAP there was like 5 customers must be the high prices got 2 jeans for 50% off (Well buy 1 and get 1 free). only tried the women\'s stretch skinny jeans at GAP. I noticed one woman stopped walking and turned around to stare at me browsing the women\'s jeans section. That made me a little nervous. The fitting room attendant probably didn\'t notice what kind of jeans I was holding. Staff was nice. Then for Marshall\'s I grabbed a bunch of jeans of different genders, colors, sizes and brands. All skinny, except one was straight. I was way more nervous this time because the store was packed with customers. There were women standing next to me looking at the skinny jeans I was looking at. I did not notice anyone staring at me though. The fitting room attendant had to count how many clothes I had to give me a number badge. I doubt she did not notice I was holding mostly women jeans well she did not say anything. Levi\'s mens jeans was way too tight could not even pull up the zipper. I tried size 29 and 31. women\'s calvin klein size 6 was a snug fit, anne klein (any relation lol?) size 4, 10 both fit. The size 4 felt like the calvin klein size 6, I suspect the anne klein has some vanity sizing. there was a size 10 anne klein straight fit, and it looked like regular men\'s slim fit with some baggage. I should have tried size 8, but size 10 was pretty good but a little loose. ended up with the anne klein skinny jeans, $25 each. They are a little looser than the gap jeans I bought, but not nearly as loose as my size 33 uniqlo pants (I later read online that uniqlo pants have huge waists) I don\'t understand how I could fit into size 4 women\'s skinny jeans but couldn\'t fit size 31 men\'s skinny jeans. maybe just a combination of levis men sizes run smaller and anne klein runs bigger?

I also am wanting this, if possible, to be at least two full days (and three nights, counting the travel day down as one night, and travel day back up as not a night, if that makes sense).

Now, considering I live about halfway between Atlanta and the Georgia-Alabama line in the SE US, you can see where I am near. I want this trip to be somewhere with a beach. The closest three options I can see as ""getting there in a day without feeling like I have to travel the whole thing in one go"" are Charleston, SC, Tybee Island, GA, and Panama City Beach, FL.

Now, you might be wondering why I picked those three, they have beaches. I am not opposed to vacation spots without beaches that may be in similar (or even less) distance, like a Chattanooga, TN. Basically, anywhere less than about 4 hours from the metro Atlanta area, give or take a half-hour of travel difference. The big attraction beaches have to me, however, is that this trip is being formulated for a time in late spring/early summer.

The main reason I am so heavily focused on the beach spots, I already have a bikini that I think I look pretty good in, and would like to actually get some use out of it this year.

Now, a cheap hotel or airbnb spot with a pool would work as well, and if the trip to that spot was, say, an hour and a half to two hours away, instead of three and a half to four and a half hours, I'd probably like the idea a LOT better, it's just that I somehow imagine a major tourist spot like a beach being a bit more LGBT friendly, even in the south.

25,2017-02-06 21:18:49,5sh01u,13,13,"Hey y'all!

I've been going through a round of self-rediscovery and during that process I discovered I was genderfluid/genderqueer. I know they're umbrella terms but the part of the definitions that fit me are where it says ""a person feels they have both male and female genders inside"". This is exactly how I feel. I've been looking at some videos on Youtube and I've learned a lot. For instance, I wake up in the morning and based on how I feel (boy mode or girl mode) that's how I dress for the day. My sex is male and I am very comfortable being male and I do not wish to transgress to a female sex. When I'm in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress.

What makes me feel this way/How did I discover this? Well, I've known I was gay ever since I was six. I didn't know what it was at the time, all I knew was that I liked boys a lot better than girls. This was also back in the late 70's to early 80's back when the ""internet"" was still a private network and the accessibility to information wasn't as easy as it is now. My gayness was something I put in a jar and put on a shelf for later reinspection. Years passed by and I grew up and came out of the closet. I didn't rediscover the genderqueer jar until about eight months ago while going through a round of talk-therapy. I needed to clean out the closet so to speak, confront and resolve some things from my past and file them away so I can continue moving forward with my life. While doing this I found this jar, blew the dust off of it and opened it up and looked inside.

I remember some things from my childhood that the typical boy wouldn't do. One of the funnier moments I remember was I was about 4 years old and I was at Kmart with my Mom. I'd always go look at the toys while she shopped and she would come get me before she checked out. She came and got me one day and I had a tea set in my hand. She didn't want to get it for me until I threw a hissyfit in the store for it. She put it in the cart and off to the register we went. I wasn't allowed to play with it while my dad was at home (for obvious reason, growing up in the rural south has its perks sometimes), but I had the best of times having my tea parties with my imaginary friends. Something else I remember, I grew up in the 80's. The 80's were great! Everyone was all coked to the gills and money was flowing around like water. The fashions and hairstyles were oh so rad! I remember having an aunt and a female cousin who ""partook"" in the 80's life. They never did any drugs that I knew of but I remember loving their outfits when I was a kid and wanting something similar for myself. I was so thrilled the first time I got a pair of parachute pants!

Moving along like the hands of time always do, I'm starting to explore this new side of my personality and I have to tell you this is the happiest I've ever been in my life. I've only got a handfull of skirts and tights because I'm just getting started in this but I cannot wait until my wardrobe gets bigger. It's kind of an irony in my life because I like to live a very minimalist lifestyle but my wardrobe is exploding! I'm designing a new tinyhouse and I can't believe that I'm actually adding a closet so I can hang dresses and skirts in. I have an imgur account that I've got a few pictures if you'd like to take a looksee at [bennetfox.imgur.com](http://bennetfox.imgur.com). I'm going to add more pictures as time progresses because I'd like to see how this evolves over time.

There are a couple things that I've learned that I don;t like. You see, my style is ""athleisure"". I like to wear sports apparel casually and one of my favorite outfits is a pleated cheer skirt and an Adidas hoody. I'm not into the hair or makeup but I do enjoy painting my fingernails. Right now they are hot tamale orange and I really like the color. I can't do hair or makeup because I an an albino and I am functionally blind. I can't see myself clearly enough in the mirror to put on makeup and do my hair every day although I would love to grow my hair long enough so I can do a small ponytail or pigtails. I don't think I can get into wigs either. The problem with wigs and makeup is it's like the person is trying to disguise something. Please don't take offense to that because I don't mean it that way. I don't really like makeup on women either for generally the same reasons. I understand people do it to make themselves feel good and that's great, that's just not me. I prefer short hair because I really enjoy dying it fun bright colors. I've got the white base to start with and it takes color so well!

The other thing I don't like is being called a ""crossdresser"". I know I said I'm comfortable with my male sex, but I am not a crossdresser. Unfortunately that word has some very negative connotations that I do not want to discuss here.

So anyways, I have some questions that I'd like to ask you:

* How did you discover that you were genderqueer/genderfluid?
How did everyone around you react to it? did you get responses from people you didn't expect and did you not get responses from people you expected to respond?

* Got any pictures of boy mode/girl mode?
Is your family in on the loop? Are they supportive or did they drop you like a bad habit?
* And finally, the restroom. Which one do you use? Have you gotten any strange or weird looks/comments while in there?

I really thank y'all for reading this. It's a long process and I'm taking it really slow and figuring out things along the way and I love having the group help and support that I get from reading the LGBTQ reddits. Hugs to everyone and y'all have a great day!

Something else I remember, I grew up in the 80\'s. The 80\'s were great! Everyone was all coked to the gills and money was flowing around like water. The fashions and hairstyles were oh so rad! I remember having an aunt and a female cousin who ""partook"" in the 80\'s life. They never did any drugs that I knew of but I remember loving their outfits when I was a kid and wanting something similar for myself. I was so thrilled the first time I got a pair of parachute pants!\n\nMoving along like the hands of time always do, I\'m starting to explore this new side of my personality and I have to tell you this is the happiest I\'ve ever been in my life. I\'ve only got a handfull of skirts and tights because I\'m just getting started in this but I cannot wait until my wardrobe gets bigger. It\'s kind of an irony in my life because I like to live a very minimalist lifestyle but my wardrobe is exploding! I\'m designing a new tinyhouse and I can\'t believe that I\'m actually adding a closet so I can hang dresses and skirts in. I have an imgur account that I\'ve got a few pictures if you\'d like to take a looksee at [bennetfox.imgur.com](http://bennetfox.imgur.com). I\'m going to add more pictures as time progresses because I\'d like to see how this evolves over time.\n\nThere are a couple things that I\'ve learned that I don;t like. You see, my style is ""athleisure"". I like to wear sports apparel casually and one of my favorite outfits is a pleated cheer skirt and an Adidas hoody. I\'m not into the hair or makeup but I do enjoy painting my fingernails. Right now they are hot tamale orange and I really like the color. I can\'t do hair or makeup because I an an albino and I am functionally blind. I can\'t see myself clearly enough in the mirror to put on makeup and do my hair every day although I would love to grow my hair long enough so I can do a small ponytail or pigtails. I don\'t think I can get into wigs either. The problem with wigs and makeup is it\'s like the person is trying to disguise something. Please don\'t take offense to that because I don\'t mean it that way. I don\'t really like makeup on women either for generally the same reasons. I understand people do it to make themselves feel good and that\'s great, that\'s just not me. I prefer short hair because I really enjoy dying it fun bright colors. I\'ve got the white base to start with and it takes color so well!\n\nThe other thing I don\'t like is being called a ""crossdresser"". I know I said I\'m comfortable with my male sex, but I am not a crossdresser. Unfortunately that word has some very negative connotations that I do not want to discuss here.\n\nSo anyways, I have some questions that I\'d like to ask you:\n\n* How did you discover that you were genderqueer/genderfluid?\nHow did everyone around you react to it? did you get responses from people you didn\'t expect and did you not get responses from people you expected to respond?\n\n* Got any pictures of boy mode/girl mode?\nIs your family in on the loop? Are they supportive or did they drop you like a bad habit?\n* And finally, the restroom. Which one do you use? Have you gotten any strange or weird looks/comments while in there?\n\nI really thank y\'all for reading this. It\'s a long process and I\'m taking it really slow and figuring out things along the way and I love having the group help and support that I get from reading the LGBTQ reddits. Hugs to everyone and y\'all have a great day!\n\nTake care!', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Genderfluid/Genderqueer males: How did you discover that you were genderfluid/genderqueer?

I am an 18 year old male. I've always been comfortable being a male. I am by no means the stereotipical boy who likes playing football and cars but I still feel very comfortable being male. I have a wonderful girlfriend which I love very much and it feels natural to be the male partner of the couple. Yet I'd also love to be a female. Not a mix of the two thing but rather be able to switch between one and the other whenever I feel like it. I would like to be able to wear a dress and high heels like I like to wear a tie for example.
Very often when I was at home by myself (I don't live there anymore) I would go into my sister's room and dress up as a woman and it felt natural, just like it feels natural to be male. I would use socks to make the breasts, use a wig, put on a dress that would not show too much of my male body of course and high heels. Whenever I did that, I, for some reason I don't know, got an erection.
Also I spent hours watching videos of other boys transforming themselves into girls using makeup and other things.
Very often I would also dream about being a female in various occasions. I would also fantasize about it in my head.
What does this mean and what could help me? Is this just attraction to the female side like any heterosexual male is or what is it? I don't feel sexually attracted by other men, I'd just like to be able to be a girl or a boy, whatever I feel like.

35,2017-02-07 18:45:37,5sn86u,10,3,"Hey everyone Sorry in advance for a probably long post! 

As long as I can remember ive not felt ""comfortable"" in my own skin... I get anxiety and panic attacks, and generally haven't been that fond of myself for lost of my life. 

Over the last few months, I've begun to notice that a lot of the things (physically) I dislike and cause discomfort are traits that distinctly categorise me as male/masculine, some of which I didn't even realise we're gender specific (the weird eyebrow lump thing/flat bit for example). 

Although I am 30 yrs old, Amab, and in a long term relationship with a cis female, I have never strongly associated with the concept of ""maleness"". It just seems a strange concept to me and growing up I never really fitted in with the whole Lad/Bro culture thing.

Having done some research here and other places (thanks everyone!) Im beginning to think that at least some of the issues I've had for years stem fr something a bit like  dysphoria... Or at least feeling freaked out and upset by stuff which makes me appear more ""male""...Which it feels weird to say, I wouldn't have believed I feel ""Sick enough"" with it to count as dysphoric in that until recently... And im still not sure I do.

Anyway, the more I thought about it the more I began to think that I've been sort of ""self treating"" for quite a while. I've been gradually removing more and more of my body hair for the last couple of years...almost always through some kind of freak out where it's been the only thing that's helped me feel better. I've been shaving my full legs for the last couple of months, and started using a home laser as well and that's really helped. I also got two ridiculously skinny long t shirts which fit like t shirt dresses, shaped my eyebrows and started wearing tinted primer as a skin base. 

In terms of self description and expression.... Im drawn to the whole androgyne/androgynous thing. I don't remember ever feeling male, but I'm pretty sure I haven't ever felt fully female either.

I'm pretty sure that stuff will continue to be hard and confusing (dunno if I'd be into HRT in the future for example?!) but everyone has to start somewhere right?

Any tips for feeling better, more androgynous or just advice about dealing with gender issues in general would be super welcome!

Whenever I am feeling like a woman, I really want to have breasts/wear a bra. 

However, when I feel like a man, I have zero desire to have breasts/wear woman's underpants. I don't want to do hormones because I'd say I'm a man 60/40 of the time (I am biologically a male), but I just want them so badly when I'm a woman, as it would make me feel SUPER feminine, and like I was a real woman :(

What are some things I can do to appear as if I have breasts? Would a push-up bra work? Or stuffing a bra with tissue paper? Can you buy a special thing to wear that has special implants?

I\'ve been very proud of my breasts and how they look in the past but sometimes I just want them to disappear for a day or two.  \n\nThis is a bit more personal but I\'ve always been comfortable with my lower regions being biologically female, but I\'ll occasionally get thoughts of wondering what being male in that area would be like?  Sometimes I even sort of wish for it but then I go back to appreciating what I\'ve got.  It\'s extremely confusing during more intimate moments when those thoughts creep up.  \n\nI\'m just really confused and looking to see if this sounds like something anyone else here has experienced and what I guess identifier they\'ve used to sort through this.  I\'m not really good or knowledgable on this sort of thing so sorry if I said anything blunt or offensively without meaning to.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Does this sound familiar/relatable?', 'created': 1487216941.0}"
92,2017-02-16 00:56:41,5ubmal,15,11,"Hi!

So I have a probably very complex question to you all: how do you define gender? How do you know that a specific part of your personality is not just your personality but an essential part of your gender? I jave only one brain with generally only one thought process, so how do I distinguish between my personality and my gender? Both are equal truths to me. And how do you express your gender?

I'm asking because as someone who is just starting to figure out their gender (all I know is I don't feel like a cis girl) I encountered quite a few people within the nonbinary community who simply dismiss how I identify based on the fact that I can't put a label on my gender yet. And i felt devastated. The people who should understand the most, were the ones to deny me the most. So here I am asking you all, who have somewhat figured out what exactly they identify as, about the points that apparently didn't make me nonbinary enough for a lot of people

*Edits are for grammar and formatting*

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve lived in this house all my life.  My parents moved out some time ago and left it to me, though they still come and visit sometimes.  It’s a nice house.  Large and spacious, there’s plenty of room for my “memories,” items ranging from tiny to wall-covering, all depicting moments of my life.  Some of these are uninteresting, and some are cherished.  I make new memories every day in my workshop.  Some would call me a hoarder.  They might be right, but I don’t mind.  I can pick up anything and remember what it means.  This was perfect living; a man in his house.

&amp;nbsp;

When I’m not playing video games, I will sometimes wander through my house to find things that I’d forgotten, things that remind me of something long in the past.  About a month ago, I came across something I’d never seen before.  I found the floorplan to the house.  It didn’t really make sense to me.  It looked like it showed a room that I’d never seen before, and it had no doors.  I thought it was probably not the final draft.  Reminded of nothing, I put it back where I found it.

&amp;nbsp;

I kept looking through to find something I’d forgotten.  Sometimes, when I do this, I’ll get a glance of my shadow, and it will look rather strange for a split second, like it’s not even mine.  Nothing is different about it, though.  It was probably just a trick of the light.  It happened again on that same day.  This time, however, I just kept looking at it, and though it was clearly me, it still didn’t feel right.

&amp;nbsp;

It felt like I needed a different shadow.

&amp;nbsp;

After maybe ten seconds, I looked away and kept browsing my house.  I passed a wall, and something about it caught my eye.  It was exactly where I remember a wall on the floorplan, one of the walls on the missing room.  I walked around it and found two of the other four walls: one in the kitchen and one in a hallway.  The fourth wall was under the staircase, just as in the floorplan.  I walked up to the first wall, pushed aside a large model of a lighthouse, and stared at my shadow, which fell right on the wall.  I don’t know why, but my heart was pumping.  Taking one more step, something compelled me to knock, so I did.  Nothing happened at first, but as I walked away, I heard another knock.  I thought that something inside probably fell off the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

The next day, I happened to be walking past that room again.  I heard another knock.  I thought I had probably stepped on the floor hard enough to knock something else off the wall inside.  That didn’t make sense, however, as that should have happened sometime before, but it never had.  I walked up again, my shadow staring at me just as it had the day before, and listened with my ear on the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

*Knock*

&amp;nbsp;

It was exactly where my ear was.  Nothing fell off.  The noise was on the wall itself.

&amp;nbsp;

*Knock*

&amp;nbsp;

It was a little louder that time.

&amp;nbsp;

*Sniff*

&amp;nbsp;

I just about died.  The sniff was loud enough for me to hear on my side.  I ran to my workshop, grabbed a hammer and my dad’s old machete—I didn’t know what was in there—and ran back.

&amp;nbsp;

*BANG BANG BANG*

&amp;nbsp;

I heard it again.  I was terrified.  I did not know what was going to happen.  Someone, or something, was in my house, though, and I had to find out who or what.

&amp;nbsp;

So I tore open the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

With a gaping hole about torso-height letting the air exchange, odd currents drifted the dust this way and that, and as it cleared, I saw a face between the studs.  It was eerily familiar.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought I was looking in a mirror.

&amp;nbsp;

After a few seconds, I did see differences.  The face was gaunt and lean, with long, long hair.  I realized shortly that this person, looking at me with wonder and fright, had no facial hair.  There was not even stubble; not a whisker.  As similar as this person looked to me, I realized that she was female, and she had tears streaming down her face.  I tore the wall down, all the way down to the floor.  She was skin and bones, wearing clothing that looked just like mine from when I was thirteen.  I waved her out with a smile, and slowly walking through the hole, she turned toward the hallway and started slowly, then sped up almost to a run toward the kitchen.

&amp;nbsp;

She knew where everything was.  She grabbed a large serving bowl, poured out all the cereal I had left in a box and almost an entire gallon of milk, and just dived right in.  Once she had eaten for a couple minutes, she grabbed some towels and cleaned up her mess.  She wasn’t finished eating, though.  She got a spoon from the drawer.  No one new has ever gotten that drawer right the first time, but she knew exactly where it was.  I just stood there in shock.  Who was she?  What was she doing there?

&amp;nbsp;

Why did she have my eyes?

&amp;nbsp;

Strangely, as she ate, I felt like I had more energy.  I thought it was probably left-over adrenalin.  I let her keep eating.  She found the lunch meat, and after she had finished a new package, she sat down, looked at me, and gave me a big, wide smile with eyes—my eyes—that seemed to glow with joy.

&amp;nbsp;

Her smile looked like my mother’s.

&amp;nbsp;

She didn’t say anything at first, but as I talked to her over a couple weeks, she quickly got a voice.  I don’t know if she couldn’t speak or didn’t want to, but now she’s talking as if she never had a problem.  I’ve been giving her my clothes to wear, though she doesn’t like them much.  I also cut her hair so it was down slightly past her shoulders, and I got it untangled.  I did strangely well.  Maybe I should have been a barber.  Her hair, though, had just the same texture and color as mine.  I thought she was probably a twin.  I had no idea why she was in that room, or why my parents never told me about her.

&amp;nbsp;

She’s much healthier now.  She even gives me energy which I haven’t known since I was a child.  In my curiosity, though, I watched her.  I wasn’t creepy about it, I just observed what she liked to do, which just so happened to be my hobbies.  Strangely, though, she never did anything in my workshop.  She did, however, pick up video games very quickly.  I realize now, actually, I had been doing less of my own things.  I spend more time in my workshop.  She creates enough memories for two people.

&amp;nbsp;

Just today, I saw her playing my favorite video game.  She’s just as good, if not better, than I am.  She offered me my other controller, the blue one.  She was holding the red controller.  I gladly accepted.  I sat down in the chair next to hers and we played a three-vs.-three together.  We were doing great.  We won that match handily, and we got compliments from our two team members.

&amp;nbsp;

Our two team members, in a three-vs.-three.  That’s four people on our team.  I check the player board, and it was just me and those two.  I look in her chair—but it’s gone.  No her, and no chair.  I start to panic a bit.  I glance at my controller as I start to put it down—it's purple.  I don’t have a purple controller.  I have a blue one.  But where did she get the red one?

&amp;nbsp;

Where is she?

&amp;nbsp;

I try to scream her name, but I keep getting my own name stuck in my throat.  I finally just scream my name—I never actually learned hers, I just realized—and something is wrong with my voice.  I need to calm down.

&amp;nbsp;

I bolt up the stairs to see if I can find her in the room I gave her, and I see her in the hallway against a wall, but only as I pass her.  I look at her, and she looks at me.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m looking in a mirror.

&amp;nbsp;

I put up my right hand, and she puts up her left.  We press them against the mirror, and my hand fits perfectly in the same spot as hers.  It should be larger.  In fact, it’s the same hand.  And she’s wearing the same clothes I am.  I look in her eyes, and she looks in mine.  She begins smiling.

&amp;nbsp;

She’s giving me a big, wide smile with eyes that seem to glow with joy.

&amp;nbsp;

I realize I’m smiling.  Smiling brighter than I ever have before.  The girl in the mirror isn’t her.  The girl in the room wasn’t her.  She was me.

&amp;nbsp;

I look at my shadow, and it's perfect.

&amp;nbsp;

The old me of yesterday never disappeared.  She and I are one and the same.  She is no different than I am, and I feel more complete than I ever have.  I finally accepted her into my house.

&amp;nbsp;

Inspired, I decide to go to my workshop and create a new memory.  In a few hours, I finish a small but powerful symbol, a combination of the symbols of Mars and Venus.

Please let me know what you think, even if you hate it!*\n\n*Edits are for grammar and formatting*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’ve lived in this house all my life.  My parents moved out some time ago and left it to me, though they still come and visit sometimes.  It’s a nice house.  Large and spacious, there’s plenty of room for my “memories,” items ranging from tiny to wall-covering, all depicting moments of my life.  Some of these are uninteresting, and some are cherished.  I make new memories every day in my workshop.  Some would call me a hoarder.  They might be right, but I don’t mind.  I can pick up anything and remember what it means.  This was perfect living; a man in his house.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I’m not playing video games, I will sometimes wander through my house to find things that I’d forgotten, things that remind me of something long in the past.  About a month ago, I came across something I’d never seen before.  I found the floorplan to the house.  It didn’t really make sense to me.  It looked like it showed a room that I’d never seen before, and it had no doors.  I thought it was probably not the final draft.  Reminded of nothing, I put it back where I found it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI kept looking through to find something I’d forgotten.  Sometimes, when I do this, I’ll get a glance of my shadow, and it will look rather strange for a split second, like it’s not even mine.  Nothing is different about it, though.  It was probably just a trick of the light.  It happened again on that same day.  This time, however, I just kept looking at it, and though it was clearly me, it still didn’t feel right.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt felt like I needed a different shadow.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter maybe ten seconds, I looked away and kept browsing my house.  I passed a wall, and something about it caught my eye.  It was exactly where I remember a wall on the floorplan, one of the walls on the missing room.  I walked around it and found two of the other four walls: one in the kitchen and one in a hallway.  The fourth wall was under the staircase, just as in the floorplan.  I walked up to the first wall, pushed aside a large model of a lighthouse, and stared at my shadow, which fell right on the wall.  I don’t know why, but my heart was pumping.  Taking one more step, something compelled me to knock, so I did.  Nothing happened at first, but as I walked away, I heard another knock.  I thought that something inside probably fell off the wall.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next day, I happened to be walking past that room again.  I heard another knock.  I thought I had probably stepped on the floor hard enough to knock something else off the wall inside.  That didn’t make sense, however, as that should have happened sometime before, but it never had.  I walked up again, my shadow staring at me just as it had the day before, and listened with my ear on the wall.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Knock*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was exactly where my ear was.  Nothing fell off.  The noise was on the wall itself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Knock*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was a little louder that time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Sniff*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just about died.  The sniff was loud enough for me to hear on my side.  I ran to my workshop, grabbed a hammer and my dad’s old machete—I didn’t know what was in there—and ran back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*BANG BANG BANG*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI heard it again.  I was terrified.  I did not know what was going to happen.  Someone, or something, was in my house, though, and I had to find out who or what.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I tore open the wall.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith a gaping hole about torso-height letting the air exchange, odd currents drifted the dust this way and that, and as it cleared, I saw a face between the studs.  It was eerily familiar.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI thought I was looking in a mirror.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a few seconds, I did see differences.  The face was gaunt and lean, with long, long hair.  I realized shortly that this person, looking at me with wonder and fright, had no facial hair.  There was not even stubble; not a whisker.  As similar as this person looked to me, I realized that she was female, and she had tears streaming down her face.  I tore the wall down, all the way down to the floor.  She was skin and bones, wearing clothing that looked just like mine from when I was thirteen.  I waved her out with a smile, and slowly walking through the hole, she turned toward the hallway and started slowly, then sped up almost to a run toward the kitchen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe knew where everything was.  She grabbed a large serving bowl, poured out all the cereal I had left in a box and almost an entire gallon of milk, and just dived right in.  Once she had eaten for a couple minutes, she grabbed some towels and cleaned up her mess.  She wasn’t finished eating, though.  She got a spoon from the drawer.  No one new has ever gotten that drawer right the first time, but she knew exactly where it was.  I just stood there in shock.  Who was she?  What was she doing there?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy did she have my eyes?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nStrangely, as she ate, I felt like I had more energy.  I thought it was probably left-over adrenalin.  I let her keep eating.  She found the lunch meat, and after she had finished a new package, she sat down, looked at me, and gave me a big, wide smile with eyes—my eyes—that seemed to glow with joy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHer smile looked like my mother’s.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe didn’t say anything at first, but as I talked to her over a couple weeks, she quickly got a voice.  I don’t know if she couldn’t speak or didn’t want to, but now she’s talking as if she never had a problem.  I’ve been giving her my clothes to wear, though she doesn’t like them much.  I also cut her hair so it was down slightly past her shoulders, and I got it untangled.  I did strangely well.  Maybe I should have been a barber.  Her hair, though, had just the same texture and color as mine.  I thought she was probably a twin.  I had no idea why she was in that room, or why my parents never told me about her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe’s much healthier now.  She even gives me energy which I haven’t known since I was a child.  In my curiosity, though, I watched her.  I wasn’t creepy about it, I just observed what she liked to do, which just so happened to be my hobbies.  Strangely, though, she never did anything in my workshop.  She did, however, pick up video games very quickly.  I realize now, actually, I had been doing less of my own things.  I spend more time in my workshop.  She creates enough memories for two people.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust today, I saw her playing my favorite video game.  She’s just as good, if not better, than I am.  She offered me my other controller, the blue one.  She was holding the red controller.  I gladly accepted.  I sat down in the chair next to hers and we played a three-vs.-three together.  We were doing great.  We won that match handily, and we got compliments from our two team members.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur two team members, in a three-vs.-three.  That’s four people on our team.  I check the player board, and it was just me and those two.  I look in her chair—but it’s gone.  No her, and no chair.  I start to panic a bit.  I glance at my controller as I start to put it down—it's purple.  I don’t have a purple controller.  I have a blue one.  But where did she get the red one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhere is she?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI try to scream her name, but I keep getting my own name stuck in my throat.  I finally just scream my name—I never actually learned hers, I just realized—and something is wrong with my voice.  I need to calm down.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI bolt up the stairs to see if I can find her in the room I gave her, and I see her in the hallway against a wall, but only as I pass her.  I look at her, and she looks at me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’m looking in a mirror.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI put up my right hand, and she puts up her left.  We press them against the mirror, and my hand fits perfectly in the same spot as hers.  It should be larger.  In fact, it’s the same hand.  And she’s wearing the same clothes I am.  I look in her eyes, and she looks in mine.  She begins smiling.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe’s giving me a big, wide smile with eyes that seem to glow with joy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI realize I’m smiling.  Smiling brighter than I ever have before.  The girl in the mirror isn’t her.  The girl in the room wasn’t her.

##### why I don't like singular, *referential* ""they"" (and don't want people to use it to refer to me)

(aka I'm probably just older than the average GQ person and we know how grumpy old people are about language change! also aka I can't stop linguisting, ever, I'm sorry. **Also I'm not trying to control your language use; do whatever you want!**)


##### Okay, first let's break apart the different uses of singular ""they"".
Taking modified examples from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specificity_(linguistics) as a starting point:

- A. I'm looking for Taylor. Where are they?  &lt;-- definite, specific (The new use of singular ""they"")
- B. I'm looking for the manager. Do you know where I can find them? &lt;-- definite (We presume the existence of a manager), non-specific (I don't know who it is.)
- C. There was a photographer I talked to the last time I was here, but I don't remember too much about them. &lt;-- indefinite (This isn't someone already in your mind.), specific (This is a specific person in my mind.)
- D. It looks like someone left their coat here. &lt;-- indefinite, non-specific


##### As for the interpretations...
I think D and B are quite acceptable uses to pretty much everyone, as long as you're thinking in terms of casual speech (since people argue different things for formal writing).


C, although acceptable, seems to have a suspicious interpretation. Because our culture and language presume that people's gender is one of two things, and that which of these two it is should be obvious, if you say C it seems like you are somehow deliberately *hiding* the gender of the person you're talking about.


A is new, and therefore weird.


Talking about a nonbinary person, Usage C: I have a friend who prefers they/them. We used to date. People look at me and think I'm a woman who dates women. So if I say ""I dated someone for four years. They never wanted to move here,"" people think that I'm hiding my sexuality. And I don't like that interpretation.


Since referential singular ""they"" (A) is also associated with uses B and D, it can sound kind of impersonal in a way.


Anyway that's it. Go back to your fabulous lives. :D


*edit: 

**TL;DR:** I prefer people refer to me as ""he/him"" and not ""they/them."" This has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else's pronoun choice, just mine. (I use ""they/them"" to refer to people who prefer that pronoun set.) I disprefer ""they/them"" for the reasons explained above.

As y'all can see from my flair I'm agender. This means to me in real life that I dress however I want, my hair is long and I enjoy makeup (personally feels like drag in a way) and such. 
I'm okay with passing as somewhat ""femme"" but I had gender and body dysphoria ever sine I can remember. Do folks here know Andreja Pejic?

All that prologue aside. I've been thinking of getting top surgery (probably keyhole cuz I'm size A) before this summer -- problem is I'm going home after the summer, and then will be living in Japan with all the hot springs / public bath culture.
My parents must not know about this and hot springs will require you to be naked. I guess my question is, 

1. Would top surgery surgeons be open to giving surgery to a pretty femme-passing person? Like no one would ever know I'm not cis unless I told them. 
2. Would size A to flat chest be very noticeable for most people? Note, that I always wear loose clothing regardless of the ""gendered"" department it comes from. 
3. What would you think if you saw a perfectly femme looking person with a flat chest? What would an average person without any LGBT familiarity think?

130,2017-02-21 23:13:05,5vey87,3,15,"Hi all. This is a long rambling almost nonsensical post of my barring my thoughts to the sub. Feel free to skip it all, there is a TL;DR below.

Since I was about 18 or 19 I began slowly questioning my gender when I first learned about the different genders. It wasn't something I really had to think about too hard when it came to the concept. There was more than just trans people? Awesome. That's cool.

I remember seeing a partner at the time questioning their identity and having a tough time with it. I remember thinking, ""What about my gender?"" and then, thinking, ""Nah, I'm fine. I'm just a girl, duh."" Yet since then, as I've learned more and more about gender expression and such I've questioned myself more and more. 

I have always, since I was a kid, loved having short hair. My mom has short hair and always has, so I guess I get that from her. 

But for the past few years I keep thinking, ""I like having boy hair."" Fake mohawks like youtuber Markiplier used to have, side swiped like youtuber Lucas, kind of punkish as well. And yet I've dyed my hair pink or purple for the past year. I'm never one to think in strict binary terms but this is confusing for me. 

Lately I'm going through a more masculine phase, even going to far as to ask my friend to call me Zack and he/him pronouns, then subsequently questioning if I even like that name for myself. 

So faced with this maze of revolving doors that is my identity I have to ask, is it okay to experiment? Can I be Zack one week, Selene the next? Can I be him now and they later and she next year? 

Being female no one cares nowadays (at least in my family) if you wear pants and a tie with your blouse or want to do a traditionally male oriented job. It's just seen as normal now. Which is good, yet not satisfying to my need to experiment with who I may be. 

For me being bi-gender, or genderfluid, or genderqueer isn't enough. I don't wish I were cis woman or male or anything like that. I just want to find my place on the spectrum. Right now that spectrum isn't a linear bar with an arrow to point where I am or where I want to be as how a spectrum is often represented. 

Gender isn't linear. People aren't linear. 

There's a lot of people who say labels don't matter, or there's no need to put a label on XYZ. But I think labels are okay. Labels help us communicate who we are. And if that label is, no label that's okay too. But for me I don't have a label and I can't communicate who I am because it's constantly changing. 

I'm reminded of the Golden Compass series. I didn't read far into the books, they weren't my thing I guess. But what I remember is that the Daemons (physical representations of the soul/mind IIRC) of children were constantly changing form, trying to find the perfect balance as the person figured out who they were. 

I feel like a Daemon. I'm constantly changing and experimenting with who I am and what I am. I just don't know how to deal with the mental whiplash and being unable to be content.

131,2017-02-22 03:40:13,5vgebr,11,13,"**tl;dr** I think I'm genderfluid and that surprises me, because I thought I was binary FtM.  I have the option to start T but I'm not sure anymore that it's right.  I'm also really tired, so I'm rambling.  I'm just looking for others to share their experience and thoughts, if they can relate.

Hi all, I've been doing a lot of thinking about myself and a lot of exploration in counseling.  

I have the option to start testosterone (I'm AFAB) but I'm so conflicted that it's probably not a good idea.  At least not ""now"", but I feel like that answer isn't ""never"", but ""now"" is probably the best logistical time.  I am lucky to live in a very LGBT friendly area, but that may not always be the case so if I leave here, I might not feel comfortable getting T or might not have as easy access.  

As far as dysphoria, there are very specific things about my body that I wish I could change to be masculine, but there are feminine things I don't want to lose.

I think I'm genderfluid and it seems to be very context dependent.  I find myself wishing that I could flip a switch and be seen as female when I want, but also as male when I want.  For every upside to T it seems like there's a downside for me.  For example, I *really* wish I could make my voice really deep when I want - to the point that I get wildly dysphoric when hearing deep male voices - but I don't want to lose my ability to speak in a higher register also.  I don't want body hair but I do want facial hair.  When I'm in a group of all men, I want to be seen as ""one of the guys"" but in my romantic relationships (with men) I feel very feminine (and am happy with that).  Etc... it goes on and on.  

And it's not confined to bodily changes, it's also present in my expression.  E.g. I like to bind my chest but also wear lipstick at the same time.  

Currently, I feel like my social transition is complete, to the degree I want it to be.  I am seen as female in all my public activities, for example at work or at the doctor's.  Even when I went to my hormones consult, I insisted that my pronouns were female and my name was my female name.  I want only my close friends and family to know about my male side and call me by that name (and not all the time).  This is not a perfect balance, but it is genuinely what I prefer.

When I first started exploring with having some people call me ""malename"" and use ""him/he"" I was so happy.  But that happiness faded over time and now it's kind of ""meh"".  I still like it sometimes, and request it in some situations, but in others I prefer ""femalename"" and ""she/her"".

The idea that I might be fluid is new to me.  I'd always thought I was a transman, FtM, and that I hated all my femininity.  But when I started exploring, I found that there is a feminine component to me; it's *less* than the masculine component, but I would still hate to lose it.  And I'm starting to think that the volatile mood swings I've coped with all my life might be related to my switching genders, in fact.  

I'm... kind of lost.  The ""standard"" narrative of ""come out, get hormones and maybe surgery, ask everyone to start calling you by a new name"" doesn't seem to fit me, but I don't know what to replace it with.

I was a very typical little girl. I loved dresses, ""girl toys"", shows aimed at girls... I started to feel uncomfortable about my naked body when I was 13 or 14, but I thought it had something to do with my discomfort with sex and me being asexual. Only times I've ever had the typical body image issues cis women have is when my abusive friends shamed me for having small boobs. I was at middle school when I first heard about the concept of ""third gender"". I was intrigued and wondered if I was (or ""could be"") like that, but I dismissed it and continued living as a girl. I also had huge issues with misogyny. Nowadays I'm a feminist and I'm actively trying to get rid of those feelings. I noticed that when I try to think of myself as non-binary or as a guy, I have a lot more positive views on women. I've heard that some trans people have problems with misogyny or misandry, because they're forced to live as that gender and it causes some bitterness. However, I can't remember having any huge problems at being referred as a girl.

I started to seriously question my gender last spring. I started to suppress those thoughts after a few days, but I can't ignore it anymore. Being a girl doesn't feel right anymore. I hate my female body. But the thing is, I was diagnosed with psychosis when I was 16. I have no symptoms anymore thanks to my meds, but I wonder if this could be caused by that?

Anyway, when I first thought myself as non-binary or as a guy, I felt light and free. It felt like I let go of years of suppression. I also received my binder last week. I almost cried when I had it on. It looked so *right*. But something weird also happened. I suddenly loathed my body and my genitals. I was almost disgusted. I put a skirt on so I couldn't see the lack of bulge and pretended that I'm a crossdresser. Is it weird that I love my long hair, my feminine face and wearing skirts and dresses but I also want a male body?

I intended to start suppressing my feelings again and force myself to feel like a woman, until today happened. I couldn't handle my constant confusion and possible dysphoria, so I drank alcohol and ended up self-harming. I haven't done that in a long time, and even when I did, I ""only"" bit myself or poked my arms with scissors. Now I actually took a knife and tried to make myself bleed. First I wanted to feel better, then I wanted to punish myself for being so confused, and then I wanted to punish my body for being female. I even started to feel suicidal again. I stopped and cried, and now I'm feeling a lot better. I'm in therapy and I intend to talk about these feelings there, but I really felt the need to write here.

I couldn\'t handle my constant confusion and possible dysphoria, so I drank alcohol and ended up self-harming. I haven\'t done that in a long time, and even when I did, I ""only"" bit myself or poked my arms with scissors. Now I actually took a knife and tried to make myself bleed. First I wanted to feel better, then I wanted to punish myself for being so confused, and then I wanted to punish my body for being female. I even started to feel suicidal again. I stopped and cried, and now I\'m feeling a lot better. I\'m in therapy and I intend to talk about these feelings there, but I really felt the need to write here.\n\nWhat am I?

Hey, so I’m going to give a basic rundown here, for better setup, and so that you can understand my situation better. I'm a guy. A paper white, skinny, tall, male. I’m 14. I’m in 7th grade (I started late and have a summer birthday). The school I’m going to is a catholic school. It’s not so bad. Very accepting. I am an atheist. This isn't what I'm coming out about, but it is kind of important for you to know so that you understand that I'm not at risk of being disowned or hated because of who I am. I'm an atheist and it's not a secret, my parents know it, my friends and peers know it, my teachers know it, hell even the principle knows it. None of them really care. They truly couldn't give a damn, it's just ""whatever"" to them. And this is just how accepting everyone is. My parents are liberal, and as such I knew that they wouldn't be upset. I had thought that my new religious school and classmates would be, but they didn't care, like I said. The teachers, while some of them disagree with it and have their own beliefs as to my judgment, I'm sure, are not persecuting to me about it and don't try to make me repent or feel bad. My friends, don't believe that I will be punished or anything like that. While they are religious, they aren't archaic about it, and most don't even believe in hell. Now, I'm also openly ""not straight"". I'm pansexual. I like everyone. But as far as my friends are concerned I'm just not straight or am just bi. I've asked out 2 girls before (failed both times), and don't try and hide my interest for any of the sexy guys the girls swoon over. I've only ever said that I didn't just like girls. I haven't really told them the label for it, but it doesn't matter. Everyone knows that I'm pansexual, no one really cares, I don't care, it's all great. Except for one issue. Well, more like two actually. My parents. They don't know. I've jsut never really felt up for telling them. I once hinted at it when saying that this would be the year of school in which I'd actually consider dating and going out with someone. I kept it purposefully vague as to the gender. I didn't say I was going to ask girls out or have a boyfriend. They both asked me about that and both said that they loved me and wouldn't mind. I said the same thing to both of them, that with all do respect, it wasn't necessarily their business. And they accepted it and that was it. This was of course before I'd come out about being pansexual to everyone, and still felt a bit timid about people knowing. Okay, I have to make a quick pause. I have a plan. I am coming out. And I'm doing it in a way that I'm proud of and think will work best for me. So I've been writing/drawing these pages with pictures/words on them. It's kind of supposed to be a 'parody' of a kids book, meaning that it kind of has that feel to it, where there's a large picture on every page illustrating the story. In this little book, is my coming out confession. It talks about alot of things. And in the end comes out about the three things I need to come out about. One is the pansexuality and to my parents. The other two I'll talk about after this little pause. I think that this way of coming out will work best for me because I'm a great writer. I talk best through written words than spoken. And this is a way that I can enjoy. Basically, my depression (yeah I have it, it sucks, but that's not what this is about) took away my passion for drawing years ago. And only recently am I getting it back. So the two things I love to do, writing and drawing, are helping me come out. I don't want this to be something I hate. I'm going to come out through words and color. Anyway that's all, quick pause over. The main thing that I'm coming out about, is something I've only told three people. I'm genderfluid. And it really sucks ass. Atleast if your trans, you can try and transition, and then it's all fixed. For me, whether or not I feel like a guy or girl, isn't some stagnant thing. It changes. And it fucking sucks so god damn much. If I could have one wish, that had to be focused solely on me... What I would give to be able to change sex when I feel like it... Anyway, sorry I just, it stinks. It really does. But like I said, only three people know. My bestfriend, I'd trust her with anything. Another friend who is transgender and kind of gets my plight. And then a new friend that I've made this year, I've told her a lot and we're really close. All three of these people that I've told, are all accepting of me. I'm not afraid to come out to my friends, well, I am, but not like a lot. My teachers, I really couldn't give a shit about what they think honestly. My parents, I know that they'd accept it, eventually. But, there's all this confusion going on. There's so many genders and sexualities and some are overly specific, some mean the exact same thing as others, some have multiple meanings that each claim is the right one. It's confusing. I get it. And there's the whole 'Transtrender' bull shit that comes with it. Suddenly everyone isn't just fit neatly into the whole binary area and everyone is different. A lot of people are a bit stigmatic towards all of this. My parents are. I think that if I said that I was genderfluid that they wouldn't take me seriously at first. I think that they would in the end. But perhaps the scariest thing, and the hardest for me to come out about. is wanting to transition. And this is kind of the thing I wanted to talk about. I came to the conclusion girls where better than guys along time ago. I can prove it through anatomy, history, society, a lot of things. While men are stronger then women on average, women can do things men can't. Women can give birth for one (just to be clear I know if I transitioned to a girl I wouldn't be able to give birth, nor would I want to, I can't stand pain and don't want to be a parent). I'll gloss over the fact of how women and orgasms work... And of course women do have to deal with periods, which, just... Respect, okay, respect. In history women have proven to be more accepting and generous. I could go on, but don't feel like it. I've always gotten along with girls slightly better than guys. And I find that if I fantasize about men (which is usually when my genderfluidism appears, sexually) I'm more often the girl with a guy than the guy with another guy. I've given it a lot of thought. And I want to be a girl. I'll be happier being constantly female than constantly male. And I know that at some point I'll begin to feel like a guy, because I'm genderfluid and it changes. But I think I'm okay with that. It's the sacrifice I'll make to be happy. I can't change when I want, so I'll change to what I want most. This is going to be the scariest to com out about. To everyone.
And that's it. That's everything. All I want is some advice. Some opinions on all of this. What I'm going through. What I'm going to do. And most importantly, advice about transitioning. I've tried researching it, but couldn't find anything that answered my questions exactly. I'm going to put a list of questions I have below. This is a really long thing to read. And if you read it all, thank you. Would you be even kinder, and maybe help me out? I don't really have anyone to ask these things or to talk about this stuff with. So, if you do respond and help me.. God, I, I can't say how much it will mean to me. But, if you do, than thank you. Thank you so much.

How does the voice work? I have a deep voice. I've been thinking on it, but this is the only conclusion: If one undergoes transitioning before puberty or during early puberty, their voice won't get deeper and they won't sound like a boy. If one goes through transitioning after puberty or during (to the point where it's to far to matter), than their voice will remain male sounding and they'll have to use a fake voice to sound like a girl. I don't think that's right, it's just what I've pieced together. I really don't want to have to pretend to sound like a girl. So how does it work?

How long will it take? I know that it varies upon age and body and a lot of other things as well. But how long might it take for me?

146,2017-02-24 15:20:01,5vy099,4,9,"Hiya. So I've been ""out"", for lack of a better word, since spring last year. Which is about October down here. I mean it starts in September but last year it was just all rain and snow so I didn't count it. ***OFF TRACK JEI!!!***

Ahum... So I haven't been hiding myself from public scrutiny is what I mean. It took me a few months to come to terms with the idea that *yes* there is such a thing as neither man nor woman outside of Intersex folks, and *yes* I've actually been that my whole life without knowing. Once I was through that I felt no fear for the ideals of people in my immediate surroundings who didn't like my being loud about it. Fuck 'em! They ruined the first half a decade of my teen years by beating the idea that not being straight was wrong into me. I wasn't gonna let that happen a second time. So when I started my job in December I showed up for my first shift with lipstick, nail polish (half of them done very nicely if I do say so myself) and a bra and skirt. I nixed the skirt idea early. It is way too sticky behind a bar and I only have the one nice-ish one at the moment. Having to clean beer off your knees at 4 in the morning ain't a happy fun time.
From there I have just embraced the idea that I can go out looking however I choose. I mean I did before, but I never really thought about dolling up before, or how fun it could be.

But that's not what I'm here to say. It's just context.
On Thursday night I went up on stage, in all my fey glory and for the first time in my life felt uncomfortable in my comfy clothes. I'd even gone for my looser knickers and rocker pants because I needed the pockets. But my bra felt constricting, my singlet clammy and my headband soaked.
I've realised part of this was simply nerves, but the other part was that I hated the idea of my looking like that being seen as a gimmick of some sort. It was a comedy show after all. I had to make these people laugh at the jokes and not just me. I can take ridicule and abuse with a smile, but up there, until I opened my mouth I wasn't a person. Just a concept. A long, thin queer with no context for the crowd to understand. I hated that feeling. I'm so glad I couldn't see their faces while I was on stage itself, because I'd seen enough of it on the floor to realise I was being seen as an act not a person...

It got better! I unexpectedly killed it on stage, even got an offer to do another gig sometime in the future. And of course once I started talking my nerves about the material just grabbed my trans angst and flung it to the horizon. I finished with a curtsy (I've always wanted to curtsy a crowd of people) and once I was down again I looked at all my fellow comedian hopefuls and noticed they no longer cared if it was drag I put on to look slightly funny or if *mayhaps* I was just a person who wanted to tell some jokes without dressing down or up. I was one of them; nervous, awkward, half drunk and fanging for a cigarette.

Just felt like sharing. Because I think there's a little bit of a lesson, for me at least. You shouldn't worry about how people see you. Some will laugh at you, others with you. But if you can laugh at yourself and be comfortable in the skin you have (and I don't mean physical traits there, more philosophical skin) then people will accept your being whether they like it or not.

162,2017-02-27 04:59:07,5weu9j,8,28,"I was at a local LGBTQ+ group tonight and we did an exercise where we gave people compliments that were not based on appearance or anything outwardly visible, and it got me thinking about gender.

And I was thinking about my experience with gender, and how so much of my experience of gender is internal, abstract, and lies in the realm of ideas.

This was especially true when I was younger; when I was a kid and a teenager I lived mostly in the world of ideas and had little focus on my body.  As an adult I now focus on my body a bit more, but I find it's still not where the bulk of my experience of gender lies.

When I think about my experience of gender here are some of the things that come to mind:

* feeling discomfort whenever people are separated into gender and i'm forced into one group (usually boys), like I didn't belong in the group, didn't want to be there, and didn't like the idea of separating people to begin with.
* empathizing really strongly with people who are subjected to sexism and/or constrained because of their gender or when people make false assumptions about them on the basis of their gender (whether it was girls or boys). feeling a sort of fierce loyalty to people in this situation, and great distrust or discomfort when groups of males or groups of females band together ""against"" someone of the opposite gender, often wanting to protect the person being attacked.
* reading articles about ""how women think"" or ""how women cope with stress"" and thinking ""this sounds like it is describing me"" and then reading ""how men do such-and-such thing"" or ""what men want"" and thinking: ""I don't relate to this at all"", yet not feeling like i was a woman.  specific examples for me include holistic thinking, thinking more about social relationships, a desire for cooperation, a communication style full of sharing and affirmation and devoid of ""one-upsmanship"", or being more desiring of intimacy than sex in relationships.
* always wanting to transcend gender, like wanting to synthesize what I saw as the best of femininity and masculinity and distance myself from what I saw as negatives of each.  especially wanting to experience and understand things outside my experience to whatever degree possible, like how the female body worked (for example i've spent more hours listening to women talk about their periods, out of fascination, than any guy I've ever met, it's like something I love hearing about because it makes me feel more connected to the experience of women)
* often having an affinity for people whose personalities seem somehow gender deviant or gender-free, like girls who were tomboys, or who liked science, math, computers, or playing with bugs and dirt, or whose communication style was assertive and direct, and connecting more with boys who were more interested in social relationships, and who had more warm, mellow, and sweet personalities and were less aggressive or rambunctious, were good listeners.
* feeling discomfort with hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine presentation or personalities and gravitating away from those people.
* feeling discomfort with the assumptions that people bring, associated with them gendering me male (or rarely, female)
* seeing how people treat women and men differently socially, and sometimes wanting to be treated in ""the other"" way

Interestingly, a lot of the people that I feel like I've connected to on the deepest levels, with respect to aspects of gender, don't always have outwardly ""nonbinary"" presentation.  These can include nonbinary people who present in stereotypically masculine or feminine ways (which may match or be opposite to their assigned birth sex), and also cis people who look ""typical"" for their gender, but cross a lot of gender roles in personality or behaviors or ways of thinking.  I find these people help me to feel more comfy with myself and I like being around them.

I wanted to share these things because I wanted to help people to think about the deeper aspects of gender that aren't always immediately visible.

I sometimes feel very frustrated with how so much of the discussion of nonbinary people and trans people focuses on appearance and the body, whereas for me it's like really about personality and ways of thinking and social interactions and things like that.  It's super abstract and intangible but like really important to me.  I also sometimes get frustrated with the emphasis on identity.  For me, the people who really *get* my gender the most, have been cis people, probably mainly because they're my closest friends and they just happen to be cis.  The whole ""cis/trans"" divide has really frustrated me much in the same way the whole female/male divide frustrated me too.  So it's like, nonbinary identity is great for helping me make sense of my experience, but when it becomes an ""us vs. them"" like against cis people or against binary trans people, I get profoundly uncomfortable and I'm like...but...the whole reason I feel nonbinary to begin with is that I hate rigid categories!

I don't know, is this making any sense?

What I am, however, considering is a vacation a few hours from where I live, in another state, come warmer weather. Basically, spend at least a couple days living as ""woman me."" Wake up? Go out to eat? Go shopping? Go to the beach? All of this as woman me.

I feel like the only way I'll know for sure if I will actually prefer being a woman over being a man is to, well, not be a man for a few days. Do everything I can to be perceived as a woman, without seeming like a caricature of course, in an environment that is separated from my local community. Not that I live in a small town, just that the area I live in has a lot of small town like connections.

I still feel like I'll have my genderfluid side, but I've always thought I'd like to have the genderfluid cake from the side of being AFAB vs AMAB. Maybe if I spend a few days trying to be perceived as AFAB, even if I get perceived slightly masculine at times, I'll see if I do actually prefer that life over mine.

Basically, spend at least a couple days living as ""woman me."" Wake up? Go out to eat? Go shopping? Go to the beach? All of this as woman me.\n\nI feel like the only way I\'ll know for sure if I will actually prefer being a woman over being a man is to, well, not be a man for a few days. Do everything I can to be perceived as a woman, without seeming like a caricature of course, in an environment that is separated from my local community. Not that I live in a small town, just that the area I live in has a lot of small town like connections.\n\nI still feel like I\'ll have my genderfluid side, but I\'ve always thought I\'d like to have the genderfluid cake from the side of being AFAB vs AMAB. Maybe if I spend a few days trying to be perceived as AFAB, even if I get perceived slightly masculine at times, I\'ll see if I do actually prefer that life over mine.\n\nOverall, I don\'t feel like ""woman me"" is that far off from me right now, just that she is probably a bit more outgoing, a bit less reserved, and maybe less prone to staying in. ""Woman me"" likes most of the same stuff, only that she doesn\'t feel the need to qualify girly pop as ""guilty pleasure.""

I've started using a pill reminder app on my phone since last I used the pill since I've started taking medication for bipolar and adhd so the pill could possibly do better than it used to but I'd honestly prefer a more long term and/or permanent solution as I don't want to get pregnant ever (I'm already a mess enough while on my period, I hate to know how I'd be if like that constantly for 9 months or more and I also don't want children). I'm in a relationship with a woman and I'm likely to marry her but if we ever brought in a third partner who was male or if,  heaven forbid, other worse possible things happened that might cause pregnancy, I don't want any risk at all. I'd also prefer to just not have a period at all because they're really rough on me, but if I have to, I'll figure it out. 

I just now finally found a psychologist that's affordable for me that may write me a letter for HRT. However, I literally just started seeing them and I may not get that letter for a while. If I had a more permanent solution, would I end up having to reverse it entirely once starting HRT and therefore waste the money I may spend on it? Or are there solutions that would work well with HRT that I could get now and have no hiccups with? Or should I just get the pill in the meantime, deal with the periods and such, and just be ready to cancel that prescription once possibly starting HRT?

While I do bounce back and forth between genders, I do wanna state I tend to lean more to the male side. I'm not sure if that will help/hinder but I thought I'd make sure to say it. I'm hoping I can get HRT in a way that leads to a more androgynous appearance to lessen the dysphoria  (I'm excessively curvy right now so I'm also worried about birth control that might add weight on as it's hard for me to lose weight, hard to build muscle, and also seems like most of my weight I gain goes towards my curves which only worsens the dysphoria too).

Essentially, I'm very confused and don't know where to look or what to do. There's a lot more reading material for transmen but I'm not aiming to do a full transition so I don't know if what they do applies in the same way. I hope you guys have some words of advice for me.

I also am wanting this, if possible, to be at least two full days (and three nights, counting the travel day down as one night, and travel day back up as not a night, if that makes sense).

Now, considering I live about halfway between Atlanta and the Georgia-Alabama line in the SE US, you can see where I am near. I want this trip to be somewhere with a beach. The closest three options I can see as ""getting there in a day without feeling like I have to travel the whole thing in one go"" are Charleston, SC, Tybee Island, GA, and Panama City Beach, FL.

Now, you might be wondering why I picked those three, they have beaches. I am not opposed to vacation spots without beaches that may be in similar (or even less) distance, like a Chattanooga, TN. Basically, anywhere less than about 4 hours from the metro Atlanta area, give or take a half-hour of travel difference. The big attraction beaches have to me, however, is that this trip is being formulated for a time in late spring/early summer.

The main reason I am so heavily focused on the beach spots, I already have a bikini that I think I look pretty good in, and would like to actually get some use out of it this year.

Now, a cheap hotel or airbnb spot with a pool would work as well, and if the trip to that spot was, say, an hour and a half to two hours away, instead of three and a half to four and a half hours, I'd probably like the idea a LOT better, it's just that I somehow imagine a major tourist spot like a beach being a bit more LGBT friendly, even in the south.

17,2017-02-06 21:08:04,5sgxpo,1,8,"Hey y'all!

I've been going through a round of self-rediscovery and during that process I discovered I was genderfluid/genderqueer. I know they're umbrella terms but the part of the definitions that fit me are where it says ""a person feels they have both male and female genders inside"". This is exactly how I feel. I've been looking at some videos on Youtube and I've learned a lot. For instance,  I wake up in the morning and based on how I feel (boy mode or girl mode) that's how I dress for the day. My sex is male and I am very comfortable being male and I do not wish to transgress to a female sex. When I'm in girl mode, I like to express it through the way I dress.

What makes me feel this way/How did I discover this? Well, I've known I was gay ever since I was six. I didn't know what it was at the time, all I knew was that I liked boys a lot better than girls. This was also back in the late 70's to early 80's back when the ""internet"" was still a private network and the accessibility to information wasn't as easy as it is now. My gayness was something I put in a jar and put on a shelf for later reinspection. Years passed by and I grew up and came out of the closet. I didn't rediscover the genderqueer jar until about eight months ago while going through a round of talk-therapy. I needed to clean out the closet so to speak, confront and resolve some things from my past and file them away so I can continue moving forward with my life. While doing this I found this jar, blew the dust off of it and opened it up and looked inside.

I remember some things from my childhood that the typical boy wouldn't do. One of the funnier moments I remember was I was about 4 years old and I was at Kmart with my Mom. I'd always go look at the toys while she shopped and she would come get me before she checked out. She came and got me one day and I had a tea set in my hand. She didn't want to get it for me until I threw a hissyfit in the store for it. She put it in the cart and off to the register we went. I wasn't allowed to play with it while my dad was at home (for obvious reason, growing up in the rural south has its perks sometimes), but I had the best of times having my tea parties with my imaginary friends. Something else I remember, I grew up in the 80's. The 80's were great! Everyone was all coked to the gills and money was flowing around like water. The fashions and hairstyles were oh so rad! I remember having an aunt and a female cousin who ""partook"" in the 80's life. They never did any drugs that I knew of but I remember loving their outfits when I was a kid and wanting something similar for myself. I was so thrilled the first time I got a pair of parachute pants!

Moving along like the hands of time always do, I'm starting to explore this new side of my personality and I have to tell you this is the happiest I've ever been in my life. I've only got a handfull of skirts and tights because I'm just getting started in this but I cannot wait until my wardrobe gets bigger. It's kind of an irony in my life because I like to live a very minimalist lifestyle but my wardrobe is exploding! I'm designing a new tinyhouse and I can't believe that I'm actually adding a closet so I can hang dresses and skirts in. I have an nimgur account that I've got a few pictures if you'd like to take a looksee at [bennetfox.imgur.com](http://bennetfox.imgur.com). I'm going to add more pictures as time progresses because I'd like to see how this evolves over time.

There are a couple things that I've learned that I don;t like. You see, my style is ""athleisure"". I like to wear sports apparel casually and one of my favorite outfits is a pleated cheer skirt and an Adidas hoody. I'm not into the hair or makeup but I do enjoy painting my fingernails. Right now they are hot tamale orange and I really like the color. I can't do hair or makeup because I an an albino and I am functionally blind. I can't see myself cleary enough in the mirror to put on makup and do my hair every day although I would love to grow my hair long enough so I can do a small ponytail or pigtails. I don't think I can get into wigs either. The problem with wigs and makeup is it's like the person is trying to disguise something. Please don't take offense to that because I don't mean it that way. I don't really like makeup on women either for generally the same reasons. I understand people do it to make themselves feel good and that's great, that's just not me. I prefer short hair because I really enjoy dying it fun bright colors. I've got the white base to start with and it takes color so well!

The other thing I don't like is being called a ""crossdresser"". I know I said I'm comfortable with my male sex, but I am not a crossdresser. Unfortunately that word has some very negative connotations that I do not want to discuss here.

So anyways, I have some questions that I'd like to ask you. 

* How did you discover that you were genderqueer/genderfluid?
* How did everyone around you react to it? did you get responses from people you didn't expect and did you not get responses from people you expected to respond?
* Got any pictures of boy mode/girl mode?
* Is your family in on the loop? Are they supportive or did they drop you like a bad habit?
* And finally, the restroom. Which one do you use? Have you gotten any strange or weird looks/comments while in there?

I really thank y'all for reading this. It's a long process and I'm taking it really slow and figuring out things along the way and I love having the group help and support that I get from reading the LGBTQ reddits. Hugs to everyone and y'all have a great day!

Take care!

I\'m not into the hair or makeup but I do enjoy painting my fingernails. Right now they are hot tamale orange and I really like the color. I can\'t do hair or makeup because I an an albino and I am functionally blind. I can\'t see myself cleary enough in the mirror to put on makup and do my hair every day although I would love to grow my hair long enough so I can do a small ponytail or pigtails. I don\'t think I can get into wigs either. The problem with wigs and makeup is it\'s like the person is trying to disguise something. Please don\'t take offense to that because I don\'t mean it that way. I don\'t really like makeup on women either for generally the same reasons. I understand people do it to make themselves feel good and that\'s great, that\'s just not me. I prefer short hair because I really enjoy dying it fun bright colors. I\'ve got the white base to start with and it takes color so well!\n\nThe other thing I don\'t like is being called a ""crossdresser"". I know I said I\'m comfortable with my male sex, but I am not a crossdresser. Unfortunately that word has some very negative connotations that I do not want to discuss here.\n\nSo anyways, I have some questions that I\'d like to ask you. \n\n* How did you discover that you were genderqueer/genderfluid?\n* How did everyone around you react to it? did you get responses from people you didn\'t expect and did you not get responses from people you expected to respond?\n* Got any pictures of boy mode/girl mode?\n* Is your family in on the loop? Are they supportive or did they drop you like a bad habit?\n* And finally, the restroom. Which one do you use? Have you gotten any strange or weird looks/comments while in there?\n\nI really thank y\'all for reading this. It\'s a long process and I\'m taking it really slow and figuring out things along the way and I love having the group help and support that I get from reading the LGBTQ reddits. Hugs to everyone and y\'all have a great day!\n\nTake care!\n', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Genderfluid/Genderqueer males: How did you discover that you were genderfluid/genderqueer?

18,2017-02-06 23:39:12,5shufk,4,2,"Very recently I began to question myself a bit, as I've felt like the girl in me is getting stronger by the day, I still feel like a guy too but I am wondering if I may be Genderfluid, the friends I talked to about this seem to think so but I want some other opinions on this.

It feels like my whole life I've been keeping my sort of ""Inner Girl"" locked away just out of fear of being judged, but at the same time I still feel like a heterosexual(straight) man(still interested in females), and to be honest, this feeling shifts around a bit, on some days I feel like a guy, on some I feel like a girl, and on some days, I feel like both, on the girl days I'd just hide it, and try to act normal, but recently I let my mom know about it and she's pretty chill about it.(She's alot like a therapist to me, she understands me the most and always wants to help whenever something is bothering me in life), she even told me I should embrace the girl side, the first thing I thought about doing to embrace it is letting my hair grow and also dying it pink and my mom thinks the idea of dying it pink would be pretty cool too.

Would I be considered Genderfluid? From the people who I talked to before about it they think I am Genderfluid so I thought a few more opinions on the matter would help.

I also plan on taking it a little slow at first with the ""Letting the inner girl out"" part, starting with just wearing the same clothes I always wear but having long pink hair,  then getting one of those ""real men wear pink"" shirts to help let my inner girl out but at the same time raise breast cancer awareness ,then even later on maybe getting some more girly clothes just to wear around my apartment.

Any thoughts? Would any of you consider this to be ""Genderfluid""? Also any thoughts on my plan for letting out the ""Girl Side"" a little more?

So gender is something we've all felt. We use terms like gender identity, gender expression, gender attraction, etc. All related issues people ask about here on this subreddit. 

So we feel our genders. Straight, trans, Bi, Pan, and everything else I've heard from there being only two to infinity. But we don't feel it constantly, right?

I feel that means its made from social, behavioral, expressive, biological (not sex or chromosomes or genitals solely) , and psychological influences. But we don't have all parts of our identity at the for front at anyone time. 

Say someone is homosexual (attracted to the same sex), they don't necessarily feel or sense that part of their identity while waiting in line at the dmv. They're probably just sick of waiting. But thats still a part of them. So since in this example we see how parts of someones identity can take a back seat can't we see how this might ably to gender?

Someone is genderfluid. They live lives and are busy people, so in-between times where gender takes the for front it can change. Why? No clue, if theres a study I don't know about links please. As far as I'm aware no one has given a reason why.

34,2017-02-11 16:44:22,5tfy05,6,2,"I guess what I mean is a variation of the common question, ""Am'I BLANK gender?""

It seems like some gender identities are very similar to on another. Like how it appears, to me at least, being genderfluid or polygendered are very similar experiences. Even Bigender seems remarkably similar to being genderfluid. 

In my first example (Genderfluid and Polygendered), how is someone to know if they are a genderfluid person whose identity varies time to time versus being polygendered experiencing multiple identities often going between them? They look to be very similar like one is just describing the state of the other. Am'I missing some small difference here? 

Or Bigender and Genderfluid don't they seem very close to one another, I'm sure I'm missing something here right?

How is a person to know they even have an alternative gender identity even to what most people have? What if someone (or I) am experiencing a need to be more feminine as it is commonly thought about? 

Like its not gender but desire to less of the stereotype they were born with, such as a feminine guy can exist and still be cisgendered.  Or maybe someone is going through a part of they're life and is just wondering about all these things about they're body. Like either through the frame work of sexually, or expression, romantic, and orientation? (if this is confusing I can ex in a further post)

When I was little it was how I found my sexuality, it always seemed to be an integral part of my life whenever I liked it or not. I always loved the idea of wearing girl's clothes, especially bras, panties and lingerie. It was a struggle with shame however, because it always never felt right. I always felt ashamed for liking it, liking to wear the pretty clothes that made me feel so cute and alive. I had a really good friend that I told about it and she accepted me, but I always struggled with the fact that there was that side of me, that side that loved girl's clothes so much.

So it ebbed and flowed throughout my life, there were times I dressed a lot and times I didn't feel the need too. I still liked it, but the fact that I didn't have easy access to the clothes I loved so much killed me because I knew I couldn't look at them the same way girls did or I'd be called a pervert, so I got sad and decided that if I wasn't able to do it the way I wanted that I would be better off not doing it. But I always looked at the bras, the lingerie and I got so jealous because I thought it was all adorable and I wanted to wear it. 

Another friend helped me reconcile it a little bit, I didn't want to turn fully into a girl because I didn't want to lose my male side, because I thought it would be running away. I don't mind being a guy, its convenient and it's also a integral part of me.

I want friends to talk about cute clothes and compare them, I have one person but she gets tired of it sometimes and I don't want to annoy her.

61,2017-02-23 17:39:19,5vrshf,15,7,"Hey all, I'm not sure whether this is the right place to go, but I don't really want to talk to my friends about it, and other people seem to have posted similar stuff before, so I'll give it a shot (if this isn't the right place, please direct me to one) :) (also, please excuse me if I've used any derogatory terms; no offence is intended at all, I have complete respect for everybody, I'm just not used to the terminology. I'm so so sorry if that happens)

So a bit of background:
I'm sexually* male, and I'm pretty comfortable with that, I don't think that's changing any time soon. But I've always had this inner curiosity as to what it would be like to be female, and on top of that, I've never been the most masculine guy (I'm not camp or anything, but I'm not manly either). I remember when I was around 9 or 10, I was fascinated with the idea of being female, but I never told anyone due to fear of rejection.


Sorry if that was more background than was needed. Anyway, that feeling left, and I was pretty set in my ways of being male, as I thought sex and gender were two sides of the same card. But recently, I've thought that one could be female in terms of sex, and male in gender, or vice versa. Moreover, I've noticed that I tend to ebb between times when I feel more feminine than masculine and more masculine than feminine (and some times when I just don't really care), though when I'm feeling more masculine, I tend to try and dismiss the thought of that and try and excuse it in some way (is that normal?). It's not like I'm against nonbinary people, I have complete respect, but for some reason my masculine mind struggles to see itself as being female occasionally.
The issue I'm having is that I'm afraid that I'm subconsciously doing this for attention or to be edgy in some way (I'm really not sure how, because I'd be ridiculously reluctant to come out), and also because it varies. When I feel more feminine, I feel like ""you know what, maybe I am genderfluid, who knows, maybe I should find out someday"", and when I feel more masculine I feel like I must be cis and me thinking I'm genderfluid just isn't correct. So my main issue is that I'm not sure whether I'm just a fairly feminine man (as my masculine mind would like to think) or genderfluid.
I did question myself with my good friend a few months ago in 2016, but I just reached the conclusion that I'm just a feminine male, but I've started questioning myself again.
I have a genderfluid friend who I could talk to, but I'm afraid they'd talk to other people about it.

I wouldn't get mad if someone called me he or she, but I'd prefer not to be called they, if that is of any value to anything. Also, I tend to be attracted exclusively to females (in terms of physical sex), whether I feel feminine or masculine, if that means anything (sorry if you didn't need to know that)

Thanks for reading, and please let me know what you think :)

(P.S. please be brutally honest in what you think, but please don't be mean about it, it took me quite a bit of courage to write this, however cliché that may be to say)

*I'm not sure whether it's right or wrong, but I generally identify sex as physical identity and gender as mental identity. Please correct me if this isn't right

Moreover, I\'ve noticed that I tend to ebb between times when I feel more feminine than masculine and more masculine than feminine (and some times when I just don\'t really care), though when I\'m feeling more masculine, I tend to try and dismiss the thought of that and try and excuse it in some way (is that normal?). It\'s not like I\'m against nonbinary people, I have complete respect, but for some reason my masculine mind struggles to see itself as being female occasionally.\nThe issue I\'m having is that I\'m afraid that I\'m subconsciously doing this for attention or to be edgy in some way (I\'m really not sure how, because I\'d be ridiculously reluctant to come out), and also because it varies. When I feel more feminine, I feel like ""you know what, maybe I am genderfluid, who knows, maybe I should find out someday"", and when I feel more masculine I feel like I must be cis and me thinking I\'m genderfluid just isn\'t correct. So my main issue is that I\'m not sure whether I\'m just a fairly feminine man (as my masculine mind would like to think) or genderfluid.\nI did question myself with my good friend a few months ago in 2016, but I just reached the conclusion that I\'m just a feminine male, but I\'ve started questioning myself again.\nI have a genderfluid friend who I could talk to, but I\'m afraid they\'d talk to other people about it.\n\nI wouldn\'t get mad if someone called me he or she, but I\'d prefer not to be called they, if that is of any value to anything. Also, I tend to be attracted exclusively to females (in terms of physical sex), whether I feel feminine or masculine, if that means anything (sorry if you didn\'t need to know that)\n\nThanks for reading, and please let me know what you think :)\n\n(P.S. please be brutally honest in what you think, but please don\'t be mean about it, it took me quite a bit of courage to write this, however cliché that may be to say)\n\n*I\'m not sure whether it\'s right or wrong, but I generally identify sex as physical identity and gender as mental identity. Please correct me if this isn\'t right\n\n*(EDIT: Spelling, grammar and a small bit of extra info)*\n\n*UPDATE:* Thank you all so much for replying and helping me find a little bit more of myself. I know I\'m really not good at replying and all I usually say is ""Thank you"", but I genuinely mean that thank you; if it wasn\'t for you guys I may have still be questioning myself for months to come, but I\'m glad I posted here!

Sometimes--indeed, often--I have thoughts along these lines: What clothes would I want to wear if I was a girl? What would my sexuality and sexual preferences be if I was a girl? What surgeries would I want to get if I was a girl? What hairstyle would I want to have if I was a girl? What kinds/styles of makeup would I want to use if I was a girl? Et cetera.

However, in additional to all of these feelings, I also feel very comfortable being a guy; indeed, while I dislike some--indeed, perhaps many--aspects of my body and face (basically, I'd like to andrognize my body and face) as well as male social roles (for instance, I would face the risk of getting beaten up if I will wear a dress or a skirt), I also enjoy living as a guy and all of that--as well as enjoy using male pronouns.

Anyway, could I be gender-fluid? Specifically, are all of these feelings of mine an embodiment of gender-fluidity on my own part?

So I've known I wasn't cisgender since I was 11, and identified with the label of genderfluid since I was 14. I finally found a name I was comfortable with when I was nineteen (shout out to my friend for coming up with it) and I am now twenty. Tomorrow, I go in to get my name changed legally. And holy shit, I am so fucking scared. 

I'm scared that they'll say no. I'm scared I'll get laughed out of the courtroom. I'm scared my parents are going to feel like they're losing their baby girl instead of gaining an adult child who is so much better than they were before. I'm scared. Just really scared. And I need kind words, please. I started disassociating about 10 minutes ago because I'm so nervous about all of this and I need words of encouragement. Have any of you changed your name?
