I'm questioning gender stuff a bit but haven't really talked to anyone about it. I have lots of nonbinary friends and close acquaintances and am also dating someone who's nb. Also my sibling recently came out as nb.

I think the gender binary is bullshit. I'm afab and present fairly femme, though have always been more interested in a more frequent gender-netural presentation. 

I don't really experience social or body dysphoria in terms of gender. I know some people who are afab, nonbinary and present femme and sometimes gender-neutral. I think I identify with that a lot (maybe) but really don't want to be a cis person appropriating a non cis identity, especially when the label woman has never felt especially wrong (I've always felt if I was amab I would feel just as comfortable with that). I feel confident about not being trans and very much do not want to take an identity or space in a way that's harmful to trans people or nonbinary people who do experience dysphoria and less comfort moving through the world than I do or severe discomfort. I want to be clear I'm writing this because I'm just starting to question.

I've been active in LGBT communities and a vocal ""ally"" for years. I've also recently discovered I'm bi/pan, which I've questioned for awhile but was always worried about being that ""straight girl experimenting"" (which is super problematic and bi-phobic! But also is something I worried about)

ANYWAY, would love to hear how afab femme folks/amab masc folks think about think about all this both in terms of what I said, but also their own gender/experiences. If someone knows of a good thread on this, I would super love to read it.

Background info:

I was uncomfortable with female pronouns as a kid and never felt comfortable around other girls, but I wasn't ""one of the boys"" by any stretch -- mainly I was just a shy weird loner who was bullied a lot for being ""ugly"" and was never fully accepted by boys or by girls, so I attributed my pronoun issue to that. 

During puberty I felt humiliated by the changes happening to my body, but I chalked that up to having parents who instilled me with unnecessary shame about my body, sex, etc., and isn't it kind of normal to feel that way during puberty?

Around college and into my twenties I learned how to present myself in a more femme way. Makeup, hair, nail polish, clothes. A couple of times I had butch phases, but they passed.

(Through all of this, I've been queer, but closeted, and at times in severe denial. Few people in my life know that I am not straight, and at the moment I don't see that changing.)

Almost a couple of years ago I had a partial breast reduction -- partial because only one breast was made smaller, in order to correct a pretty significant asymmetry. Ever since then, I have been happier with my body and have been gradually becoming more neutral/masculine in my gender presentation. I never even realized how much the larger breast had been holding me back until it was shrunken down to size. I sometimes wish I'd just gotten full top surgery because I hate having breasts some days, even though they're small and easy to hide. 

The other night, I was looking at myself in the mirror and I thought, holy shit: could I be both a woman and a man? Neither? Something in between?

For many years I lived without thinking about my gender. I was really annoyed because I couldn't dress as a female and I envied how girls could interact among themselves. Those were the issues that pushed me to seek knowledge about myself.

I don't really feel body dysphoria, but I do get a little social dysphoria sometimes. I'm afab and every so often someone will think I'm a boy, and it feels weird.

Today, everything fell apart. He wondered aloud, the same as I have in my head, that if nothing is changing, and i am going to be who I've always been,  why go through all this re-identification (my paraphrase)? Then he said that he's scared he won't be attracted to me anymore and that he wants his wife to be a girl and that he didn't sign up for this (his words).

So, like the title says, I was on T for about 3 days shy of 3 months. I fully plan to start again in 3 months.

They had experimented with going on and off for periods of 3-4 months each over some years. I talked to my Doctor at PP and she said it wouldn't be the easiest on my hormones but I could do it and be safe.  
  
I started on .25ml of 100, then moved up to .30ml after a month and a half and my last shot was .50ml. All were weekly and I never missed a dose. I've been off T for about three weeks and already things have changed.  
  
Going on T, I experienced:  
>Peen growth (I haven't measured but I'd say I'm about shy of an inch when hard?)  
  
>Facial hair. I already had a dirt stache to start with but it became coarse and I had to shave more often. I get 5 o'clock shadow now on my upper lip. I also have some coarse chin hairs. You could probably count them. Those grow back very quickly. Also I started to grow some side burns but it was very faint. And bushier eyebrows.

>Voice dropped. I can post voice recordings later but even though my family hasn't seemed to notice (they don't know I was on T), there's a big difference.  
  
>Face masculinization. I went from round baby-doll face to young man. This was the change that I loved the most. I passed about 75% of the time as a guy and the rest as a girl or ""other"".   
  
>Body hair. Legs, arms, ass, stomach, chest. It's all very subtle but my legs are very visibly more hairy including darker upper thigh hair.  
  
>Muscles! I wasn't buff but I had way more masculine arms and legs.   
  
>The rest is everything else in the book: higher sex drive, energy, hungry, sweaty, etc.  
   
  
Since then, things have changed FAST!   
No changes in hair yet, but my newfound muscles are all gone. I'm back to my feminine arms and legs. My face is a round squishy feminine face again. My dick is the same. I pass as female about 90% of the time now, albeit a hairy one, and the rest of the time, people hesitate to gender me. I can post photos if anyone wants. I've been too afraid to record my voice because that was nearly the number one reason I felt T was life or death. I absolutely hated how I used to sound and it would always give me away. Friends would even, well meaningly, ask if I experienced dysphoria because of it. Rude, I know. But without having recorded it recently, I don't know if it has raised up at all but I notice that my ""default"" tone is higher again. I can still go lower but it has to be a conscious effort.

16,2017-08-04 20:09:34,6rn555,13,31,"I've never wanted to make a big deal about my gender identity, and I've spent most of my life questioning it (especially before learning about nonbinary gender identities).

As of the past half year or so, I'm just now maybe 85% or so confident about the accuracy of the nonbinary / transfeminine agender labels in describing me.

And I've been sort of.. quietly and/or gradually coming out without ""coming out"" coming out, if that makes sense. I've been trickling out.

I've worn make-up on and off since I was about 14. (It's over 10 years later now.) It was initially about covering up acne, but it's also been about looking just ever so slightly more feminine.

Last year, I started wearing nail polish just as a subtle addition of femininity to my presentation. When people ask why I'm not sure what to say other than ""I like it?"" (And what I really want to do is berate them for questioning me for not aligning myself with traditional gender roles.. maybe I'll start doing that eventually who knows..)

There are a couple people in my life that I told I suffer from gender dysphoria, but without going into further detail.

A few people (close peer friends) know (that I'm nonbinary), but most only know what they see which looks like a kinda fruity mostly-straight guy.

I subtly correct friends who accidentally misgender me who know better. Like ""Who said anything about [insert gendered word/phrase here]? *sad face*"" and the like.

I do even subtler things when misgendered by someone who doesn't know (or emotionally affected by gendered language by someone who doesn't know)... 

Like.. when instructed ""guys on this side, girls on this side of the room"", starting to walk toward the girls section initially and making people giggle, and then going back to the guy's side kinda looking like ""oh, well fine, i guess so"" but it's all in such a way that people probably thought I was just joking around.

Or like.. just not responding, when the 'guys' in a room are addressed to respond or do something.

I'm near constantly pushing back against anti-male stereotypes, so I think this probably somewhat prevents people starting to think I'm MtF trans, and makes them think I identify as male and an MRA or something. MRAs think I'm feminist. Feminists think I'm MRA. I'm neither, kind of like my gender.

I've been increasingly talking about and posting links to trans/nonbinary related issues on social media (with a clearly pro stance on it).

I don't ask to go by gender neutral pronouns, but I make subtle alterations to my own language sometimes that hints at my gender identity. (E.G. Singing ""Never gonna give you up"" @ Karaoke and changing ""(you wouldn't get this from) any other guy"" to ""any of the guys"")

I recently changed my gender as displayed to my friends on my social media account to ""Non-Binary"", without announcing it or anything. Someone will only see it if they specifically browse to my ""About me"" section, but it's technically now there for all my friends to potentially see, no ambiguity (other than the sort of ambiguity that is nonbinary itself).

I mentioned offhand yesterday in a comment to a stranger on social media that I don't identify as a guy but will defend them.

I feel like the the trickling is speeding up exponentially. I'm getting more and more confident, and getting more and more fed up with the downsides of having people think I'm cisgender.

But recently I've come to realize (through being in an intimate relationship) that I don't really like how my vagina looks. Now I don't know if its just because I'm insecure about how it looks, or if I don't really liks it because its a vagina. I love my girlfriend's, but not mine.

This part may seem small but it's honestly a big reason why I've been questioning lately. In any video game I've played, or characters that I've made that are supposed to represent me, I have always chosen or created male characters. I cannot seem to make myself a female character, even when representing myself specifically (like an OC/self insert kind of character). It just doesn't seem right.

I have always had high levels of natural testosterone, which might be contributing to my dysphoric stuff. I have a strong jawline, easily put on muscle, a low voice for a girl, high sex drive, etc. I've wanted to cut my hair short for a while but I'm afraid it will look bad and/or I will wish I had my long hair back.

I've never minded being gendered as a woman, but I feel that I wouldn't mind being gendered as a guy either. Maybe. Idk, but I would want to know what it feels like.

Lastly, during sex I often wish I had a penis. Mainly because I would love to go inside my girlfriend. I also fantasize about her having a penis to go inside of me. She and I have talked about strap ons, and we plan on getting one at some point. I tried on-a-whim ""packing"" for a day to see if that felt better to me, but it didn't, so wanting a penis seems to be mainly about the sex aspect of it.

Hey everyone! I (AMAB) recently came out as non-binary and even more recently have started to identify as trans-feminine. As I have begun accepting this part of my identity one of the things I did was start to shake up my wardrobe. I started shopping for women's clothes this summer and have been working to create a more feminine style for myself. When I started this journey I was looking for inspiration and discovered very quickly how little there was.

From my personal observations, it seems like most non-binary fashion and style resources out there are either by/geared toward AFAB non-binary people creating a more androgynous/masculine style, or AMAB non-binary people who are thin to average sized and often with already androgynous to feminine body types. These resources are great, but as I am definitely of the plus-sized, male-bodied variety, I became quickly frustrated because I felt like there were no resources out there for me to really draw inspiration from. With the help of some women's plus-sized style guides and some amazing friends, I was able to find styles that work for my body and make me feel great, though it took a healthy amount of trial and error.

So my question is this: would there be any interest in a blog geared toward Plus-sized, AMAB, Non-binary, Trans-feminine Style (or PANTS, as I have decided to call it)? I have considered documenting some of the outfits I have put together, talking about sizes and finding shapes and cuts that fit my body type, and my journey to realize my full self.

I have been avoiding binding not because of the heat but because of the sadness it brings. It's not increased dysphoria but grief and fear and confusion. I am non-binary. I do not have a clear cut path set for me. I have to tread a path that isn't really talked about and is thick with underbrush.

Putting on my binder reminds me how much I hate my body. How happier I would be if I could just go further with my transition. But my grief and attachment to my body makes me feel less. That I do not deserve to transition because I have formed an ok relationship with my body as it is. Looking in the mirror when I'm binding makes me feel like sobbing. I'm reminded of how happy I would be if I could face the fear.


But I AM scared. I have tried so hard to love my body. I just want to be better but I'm scared I will regret it. I am scared I'm faking it. The idea that your transition is magic is bullshit. There is a terrifying aspect to it all. To letting go of the body that you've had for your life up until now. I want to cling to my curves and softness because it's all I've known. Because I am neither here nor there and I don't know what that means for me. I am both stuck in uncertainty and certainty. This desire to chase what I know will help but not wanting to let go. The fear that not only will lovers no longer want to touch me but that I'll hate everything I'll become.


All I want is to be happy. I just want to make this body better. It'll never be perfect. But it could be better. I don't want to talk about this because I hate sharing real weakness. I have managed to get medication that makes my depression much quieter. But this feeling still hangs on my bones. I cope by forcing myself to accept my body. There's a deep hollow ache that I cradle in my rib cage.

In the past year my partner has changed their pronouns and I asked L if it was okay to tell my parents which they said it was fine. So I brought it up to my parents the next time I saw and told them that L now uses they/them and my parents got very defensive and tried to argue with me about my partners decision.

32,2017-08-09 20:01:27,6so37g,4,2,"Hi all, 

I thought this might be the best place to post this. I recently received a letter regarding a session at Charing Cross GIC, I'm aware that people are invited to these before their first appointment. However I have since been called in regards to a first appointment, which will be in two weeks time.

I suppose I should also give some context as to why I'm writing this post. I began my gender identity journey around September/October time last year. I essentially had been puzzling over some gender related feelings and doing my research on gender when I came to the conclusion that I was transgender (transmasculine as I'm AFAB).

Over the course of my journey, I have tried to explore my identity and expression in more depth. I was fortunate enough to have two rounds of therapy which helped me explore things more. One thing my therapist mentioned is that it sounded less that I was questioning but rather being doubtful.

This resonated with me as whenever I think of my gender, it's some form of non-binary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming identity. I identify with those labels but I feel I might be bigender (female/neutrois). I'm coming to terms with my feelings but I can't help feeling like an imposter as an AFAB femme-presenting non-binary person. 

I feel some connection to womanhood but also to gender neutrality, at times being gendered as female feels either wrong or not wholly accurate. It's hard to describe. It's also difficult because I see the stereotypes of ""SJW non-binary"" people, I am also left wing and am heavily interested in broadening the concept of gender massively. 

I never know if my anxiety comes from being nonbinary in a cisnormative society where we're told there are two genders with just many variations. 

I think any dysphoria I experience is mostly social, sometimes maybe physical. If mental dysphoria manifests as anxiety over your identity, then I'd say this is quite high.

I recently received a letter regarding a session at Charing Cross GIC, I\'m aware that people are invited to these before their first appointment. However I have since been called in regards to a first appointment, which will be in two weeks time.\n\nI suppose I should also give some context as to why I\'m writing this post. I began my gender identity journey around September/October time last year. I essentially had been puzzling over some gender related feelings and doing my research on gender when I came to the conclusion that I was transgender (transmasculine as I\'m AFAB).\n\nOver the course of my journey, I have tried to explore my identity and expression in more depth. I was fortunate enough to have two rounds of therapy which helped me explore things more. One thing my therapist mentioned is that it sounded less that I was questioning but rather being doubtful.\n\nThis resonated with me as whenever I think of my gender, it\'s some form of non-binary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming identity. I identify with those labels but I feel I might be bigender (female/neutrois). I\'m coming to terms with my feelings but I can\'t help feeling like an imposter as an AFAB femme-presenting non-binary person. \n\nI feel some connection to womanhood but also to gender neutrality, at times being gendered as female feels either wrong or not wholly accurate. It\'s hard to describe. It\'s also difficult because I see the stereotypes of ""SJW non-binary"" people, I am also left wing and am heavily interested in broadening the concept of gender massively. \n\nI never know if my anxiety comes from being nonbinary in a cisnormative society where we\'re told there are two genders with just many variations. \n\nI think any dysphoria I experience is mostly social, sometimes maybe physical. If mental dysphoria manifests as anxiety over your identity, then I\'d say this is quite high. \n\nMy main question is, will I be treated as someone who could not receive therapy at the GIC?

She doesn't use my pronouns, I've almost given up on that.

A few of her coworkers know and made a joke about my mom changing HER name and asking me to remember it, and then I would see how hard it was for her. She came home and told me about the joke. I was offended and she said ""I thought you might react like this. It comes from a place of love."" I explained that intent does NOT mean anything, and something that comes from a well intentioned place can still be really hurtful.

She's generally really accepting. When I came out as queer, she was so totally fine with everything but when it comes to gender she just doesn't seem like she gets it. 

How do I make her understand that the situation she told me about isn't a joke, it's a time when I need her to defend me? How do I get her to understand that using my name is not a bonus? That it isn't a nickname? Are there any resources that I can show her that help to explain this?

I've been assigned female at birth and I've been trying to figure out who I am for awhile now. The first step was to change my name and find a gender neutral one, which my partner helped to choose. That has helped me a lot and made me feel much more comfortable with myself. 

These last few days, I've been experiencing extreme (for me) dysphoria. I basically don't feel comfortable with seeing my body (breasts and vagina) and don't feel good knowing that it's there. I also have been having trouble with woman associated nicknames such as princess. I've never experienced it before and I feel lost. I'm trying to talk about it with my partner as much as possible but I'm always afraid he'll judge me. Right now, I've asked him to use gender neutral nicknames and not refer to me as something specific but I'm afraid I might want to look more like a boy which I'm not sure how to approach yet. He has been supportive so far and says he'll always support me but I'm scared I'll go too far and want a pronoun change and he won't love me anymore. He really hasn't done anything that would make me think that way but I can't help it. 
So, he knows about all of this and is trying to avoid the nicknames and is doing everything he can to make me comfortable. 
I was just looking for advice on how to improve the situation, make the feeling disappear a little? 
Also, I wonder if I'm non binary or agender, can someone explain/define these words? Thank you for reading.

He's in kindergarten this year so this will be his first birthday where there will be kids from his class, not just family members and family friends kids attending the party. 

My nephew loves to dress up in dresses and he loves to wear towels on his head and pretend they're long beautiful hair. My entire family supports him however he wants to express himself. He asked me for a black/purple/red/pink wig because he's tired of using towels and it's already on it's way. 

My question; I've noticed he's been wearing his moms cardigans and his dress up capes as skirts, and pretending they are ball gowns like the characters wear on ""ever after high"" (his fav show). I found this really cute dress up skirt for kids on Amazon and want to get it for him. Do you think I should give him the skirt at his party when all the gifts are exchanged or maybe after when his classmates leave? I don't want him to get made fun of, but I don't also want him to think that expressing himself is wrong or shameful either, because it's not. I love him and my family loves him no matter what. 

I just want to protect him and his feelings. 

Any advice or suggestions would be immensely appreciated.

86,2017-08-23 00:01:11,6vf67w,5,6,"Hey all! 

Just recently made a Reddit account, so I'm still getting used to things. 

So several months ago while I was in a poly relationship with one of my friends who is openly MTF and already over a year into HRT (though we're not together anymore, we're still pretty close), I started really thinking more about my gender identity than I had in the past. 

That's not to say that I never thought about it prior to dating her though. I started wondering what my life would be like as a girl as early as 15 (I'm 21 and AMAB btw), even asked a few of my friends how they would see me (like would I be femme or tomboyish, I can kinda see myself as both) and even asked my parents what my name would have been if I had been AFAB. They didn't really have an answer for me though. 

I didn't really know anything about gender identity back then tho, and it's been a few years since I discovered how much I adore androgynous characters in media (especially anime because I'm a total weeb degenerate lol) and actually wanted to be one of them. But even so, I didn't even really think too deeply about that. There's definitely the feeling that I waited too long to explore all of this, and I've finally gotten to the point where I don't want to stall any longer. 

I don't know if I can say that I have dysphoria, but I do know that I'm unsatisfied with my body right now. I absolutely loathe my body hair (especially what's on my legs and in between my crotch) or how skinny my arms and torso are (which is why I started working out with a personal trainer). I don't want to get rid of my junk and I'm not sure if I want or need HRT or top surgery. But I suppose there's plenty of time to figure that out. 

After talking things through with some of my trans and NB friends, I think I'm fine with being androgyne but I want to get in touch with my feminine side more because I can't think of a single day of my life where I felt any affinity to masculinity. I feel like I could be a lot more feminine than I am now. I don't mind boys clothes but I also would love to wear cute girly stuff and pass as both male or female (because I don't necessarily see myself as either nowadays). I don't mind male pronouns but I think I'm going to try moving away from them because they/them fits me a lot more. Lastly, I'm no longer quick to correct people when they call me ma'am over the phone. 

So I guess at the end of this I have pretty much figured out that I'm non-binary, but I wanted to ask others if this sounded like being non-binary to them. 

But most importantly, what do you all think my first steps should be? I'll appreciate any responses and feedback I get from this post. Thank you.

I don't want to get rid of my junk and I'm not sure if I want or need HRT or top surgery. But I suppose there's plenty of time to figure that out. \n\nAfter talking things through with some of my trans and NB friends, I think I'm fine with being androgyne but I want to get in touch with my feminine side more because I can't think of a single day of my life where I felt any affinity to masculinity. I feel like I could be a lot more feminine than I am now. I don't mind boys clothes but I also would love to wear cute girly stuff and pass as both male or female (because I don't necessarily see myself as either nowadays). I don't mind male pronouns but I think I'm going to try moving away from them because they/them fits me a lot more. Lastly, I'm no longer quick to correct people when they call me ma'am over the phone. \n\nSo I guess at the end of this I have pretty much figured out that I'm non-binary, but I wanted to ask others if this sounded like being non-binary to them. \n\nBut most importantly, what do you all think my first steps should be? I'll appreciate any responses and feedback I get from this post. Thank you. "", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""Determining if I'm non-binary or not and first steps"", 'created': 1503471671.0}"

92,2017-08-24 09:18:47,6vpojf,5,1,"I've been questioning my gender identity/expression/idk lately. Lots of factors are going into making me question why I am questioning it. So I am a 28 AFAB. I am okay a lot of the time with being a woman. If I were to change my pronouns at this point, I would just add on they/ them/ theirs and still use she/ her/ hers, but I realize that might be confusing for some people? I don't know what that makes me, really.

I'm just going to jump right into some things. It was discovered that I have a hormonal imbalance. I have an abnormally high testosterone count (like 113 or something) for a woman and I wasn't getting my period because of it (I don't have PCOS or any tumors, it's just abnormally high for unknown reasons - any insight as to why that could be and if that could be affecting me?). I only get my period when I'm on birth control at this point. I went back on birth control, got my period, and I was a wreck the whole month with emotions and got really bad dysphoria with my period. Like it was this foreign thing that I shouldn't be getting. I've had that a lot in the past, and I don't know if it's because I have gone really long stretches without getting it, or if it's connected to concerns about gender, or if it's because it's normal for women to hate their period. But it just didn't feel right. I was supposed to keep taking birth control, but I didn't, and didn't tell my doctor. I even asked to go on a different medication, not even voicing my concerns completely, just saying that my emotions and migraines were out of control. But now she says this other medication (metformin, which is actually a medication for diabetes, which I don't have but helps balance hormones) might give me my period, and it might help me lose weight - but now I'm thinking of asking to just go back on the birth control or do nothing because even though I need help losing weight (huge issue for me), it's not worth having my period and not having the option to skip it.

Another thing. TW: I was raped about a year ago. It really messed me up bad. I have PTSD because of it. I'm in therapy and see a psychiatrist. I was already doing that but it also caused me to be hospitalized three or four times. I've already struggled with depression, anxiety, and past abuse. Anyway, I wonder if some ""dysphoria"" I have with my breasts could actually be tied to the rape and how bruised they got, and how maybe it's just a huge trigger now. I used to be fine with that part of me. It now just makes me feel terrible when anyone is looking at my chest or sexualizing me as a woman. I never feel like a guy but I kind of want to disappear, even though at the same time I wish my boyfriend and I were having sex even though our sex life is non-existent and we're poly, and I'm scared to even try to seek out someone else.

Lately I've looked up binders and wondered how that would make me feel. I never want to be a guy. However, sometimes I really feel uncomfortable with my womanly features, or at least my chest and my long hair (I'm trying to get my hair cut really soon into some sort of side cut asymmetrical bob I think), and from what I've seen online/ on tinder, I'm really attracted to women/ people who have androgynous looking genders? I hope that doesn't sound offensive. I find myself being attracted but also wishing I looked like that and wanting to emulate it. I wonder if this is a new thing or if it's been there for a long time and I'm just now acknowledging it. I've always struggled with what to wear when I go out and some days I've dressed a certain way but some days I've dressed in a way that makes me ""comfortable"" and it leans more towards androgynous.

I have found myself lately wanting more androgynous clothing and wanting to look that way more? I've reasoned it to not wanting excess attention from guys and it being a comfort thing but I don't know if it's necessarily a negative thing in that way. I don't know if maybe it means that I just feel more comfortable being androgynous. Sometimes I still like dressing up but a lot of the time I don't. Idk.

But at the same time, I love makeup?

I think a lot of disappointment in my body is weight related. Maybe I'd be more comfortable being womanly if I wasn't overweight. But I'm not sure. Also a lot of it is related to my sexuality I feel like, and having finally come out as bisexual after hiding for so long. I feel more comfortable dressing a certain way, maybe not as feminine, because I don't have to necessarily hide who I am.

Does anyone have any insight into if any of this makes me genderqueer/ nonbinary/ genderfluid, or if there's something else going on? Does anyone have any advice for me?

97,2017-08-25 02:14:28,6vvmsb,1,6,"I've only recently come out to myself as nonbinary and it still doesn't really feel... real I guess? Like theoretically it makes much more sense than female (I'm AFAB), but it doesn't feel particularly pertinent to my life?

I have a few genderqueer friends who don't see the point in transitioning in any way, whether through expression or pronouns or anything more like hormones or surgery. They aren't out at home and only came out to me because I asked them about my own pronouns.

Whenever I mention it (being NB) off hand in conversation, I don't get a reaction. I know I should be grateful that I'm not receiving a negative reaction, but I can't shake the feeling that my friends aren't taking my identity seriously, or maybe think it's a phase I'll get over (they are all queer or allies, so they aren't hostile or anything but understanding in any other regards). It's more like they don't know how to respond, so they change the subject or let it slide.

This is still very new to me, and I guess I want someone (who isn't on the internet) to validate my gender identity. I came out to my dad, and he... didn't have much to say. Didn't really have any response, just diverted the convo away from me and toward like theoretical terms, like talking about other genderqueer people I know. It would just have been nice to hear the typical ""thanks for telling me, I love you no matter what"" or some shit, even if it's unspoken I'd like to hear it. Again, I realize I'm lucky that he didn't kick me out of the house or something, but it almost made me feel even more closeted than before I told him, like he didn't want to hear what I had to tell him.

I guess... keeping this knowledge inside is not working. So how do I transition in respect to introducing this part of my life from my laptop to my everyday activities?

It\'s more like they don\'t know how to respond, so they change the subject or let it slide.\n\nThis is still very new to me, and I guess I want someone (who isn\'t on the internet) to validate my gender identity. I came out to my dad, and he... didn\'t have much to say. Didn\'t really have any response, just diverted the convo away from me and toward like theoretical terms, like talking about other genderqueer people I know. It would just have been nice to hear the typical ""thanks for telling me, I love you no matter what"" or some shit, even if it\'s unspoken I\'d like to hear it. Again, I realize I\'m lucky that he didn\'t kick me out of the house or something, but it almost made me feel even more closeted than before I told him, like he didn\'t want to hear what I had to tell him.\n\nI guess... keeping this knowledge inside is not working. So how do I transition in respect to introducing this part of my life from my laptop to my everyday activities? I haven\'t had any negative reactions yet (I\'ve haven\'t even been out for a month though), but does anyone have any negative experiences they would be willing to share, so I could avoid that? I\'m pretty open about a lot of things (I\'m very much bisexual, and open about that), but I\'m finding it difficult to be open about something that not so many people really understand.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Coming out to Friends', 'created': 1503652468.0}"

106,2017-08-27 03:01:43,6w9yx2,18,10,"Hello. AFAB enby here. I'm still pretty new at all this, so be nice please.


I only first heard of NB people from Thomas Sander's youtube videos. His friend Joan identifies as nonbinary, and Thomas always makes sure to use their correct pronouns. It didn't click that I identified the same way until I did some pretty intense googling. If I hadn't done the research, I'd probably still be a very unhappy female.


I'm loving all the representation that the LGBTQ community is getting now, in the media, on TV and in movies, and in books, what have you. But 9 times out of 10, it's a (cis white) gay or lesbian. I can list one trans character and that's the woman from Orange is the New Black. Otherwise, every single goddamn character is either straight, or cis, or both.


On a related note, I am a strong advocate for self-discovery. It's a process, not a destination. In real life, it can take people years to understand themselves, and even if they recognize their own queerness, repression and homophobes (and transphobes, and biphobes, etc) can keep people from coming out.


This is rarely explored in the media. Gay characters are gay. They're out and proud. Or, they're gay, but they need to come out of the closet. But my point is - they know they are gay! Or bi! Or trans! Or whatever queer identity applies! They already know and have a word for themselves and everything!


I can't think of a single example (off the top of my head, feel free to illuminate me) of a queer character who *legitimately didn't know who they are* and then went through the process of self-discovery we all go through. We aren't born queer. Well, we are, but we don't shoot out of the womb wearing a rainbow flag around our necks as a cape. At some point in our lives, whether that's early or late, we figure out our identity. Or maybe we never do. And that's okay.


What's not okay is little old me sitting here thinking, I can't be bi, I've always been straight. I can be NB, I've always been cis. And yet, I went from CisHet one year to a bisexual (possibly demi-sexual) nonbinary (possibly agender) the next. I'm still in the middle of this process. And that's okay.


So, why doesn't the media acknowledge this? In my lowly opinion, it makes for a much better story than the old ""I'll have a gay panic and then suddenly be overtly gay all the time"" which is growing a bit thin. Give me a young person of color who likes to wear dresses *and* suits, and finds out they're genderqueer, but takes some time to figure out if they're trans or NB or genderfluid. Give me a 40 year old widow who never gave her sexuality a second thought until she fell for her kid's preschool teacher. Give me queer people protecting and supporting one another, and helping each other learn about themselves.


Don't give me the token gay. I don't need one minute of your gay best friend to prove you're not homophobic. I don't want to see the same cis white male have a gay panic and become that token gay best friend.

114,2017-08-29 06:23:53,6wpfoz,5,13,"I'm at a really rough place with my transness where I've resigned myself to never ever coming out and it really hurts but I can't imagine ever actually doing it, I'm too scared and I have absolutely no support system to fall back on.

I realized I was nonbinary four years ago and since then I've identified allll over the spectrum trying to figure out exactly where I fit and how I feel. I came out to a couple people and absolutely no one had a positive reaction, especially my mom. I still think about the hurtful messed up things she said every day and that was probably 3.5 years ago. So that pretty much kept me closeted for all of high school, I didn't get to experiment much with presentation or anything.

Then last summer I moved out of state for college and let myself come out- I got to introduce myself as my chosen name, people used they/them for me, I got to be around other trans people irl. It was a really incredible feeling. But I had a huge mental health crisis and had to drop out after one semester and move back to my tiny shitty town.

And since then I've just been mega closeted. And it really really hurts, to (on top of how fucked up the past year has been for me) have to go from feeling respected and safe for the very first time... to being 100% closeted and alone. It has really fucked me up. And I almost moved to a big city to live near my trans friend and actually try to make something happen for myself, but at the last minute I panicked and now in a few days I'm moving 1hr away to an even smaller town to live with a bunch of ""friends"" who I don't think I can ever ever ever actually come out to.

And it's really fucking with me. I try not to think about it and I try to convince myself that it's fine but I really don't think it is. All I want is to come out and present how I want to and have people call me THEY and be who I am and fall in love and have meaningful friendships and do anything but drink and shut down and repress all this shit. But I don't see how it can happen. I'm just not brave enough? I'm not strong enough? And I don't know what to do and it makes me want to kill myself.

I don't know how to talk about it and I don't have anyone to talk to about it anymore (I've spent the last 8 months pushing away anyone who actually cared about me lmfao) but I know I need to talk about it and want to talk about it. 

Today I looked at myself in the sideview mirror and something about the collared shirt/hair behind my ears/not being able to see my chest made me feel like maybe I looked like anything other than a girl, and I felt peaceful and happy with myself for the first time in so so long. I just want that feeling all the time.

Now obviously, I know Reddit (and the internet) is very American centric. I'll happily listen to American stories (if you have them please, feel free!) But since I'm in the UK, I'd be better hearing from UK peeps.

After another horrible bout of dysphoria (brought about by a costume company) I admitted to a friend about wanting to maybe go on hormones. Not a full transition, obviously (I'm AFAB, with no desire to be a guy), just enough that when people look at me, they don't automatically think 'GIRL!'

My friend agreed to go to the doctor with me, especially since I recently learned that apparently you have to be referred to a gender clinic if you ask. But that's as much as I know and I'm currently TERRIFIED that I'll go and be laughed out the door.

I am a queer female doctoral student in clinical psychology and conducting a research study on stress, resilience, and sex among trans women. Much of my research and clinical training thus far has focused on mental health outcomes and HIV risk within trans populations. Right now, I'm looking for trans women to complete a 10-minute, anonymous, online survey. By participating, you can help the mental health field develop better, trans-specific interventions and ultimately provide more effective mental health and medical care to trans women.

Please consider participating if you 1. identify as a transgender female, trans woman, or trans girl, 2. are 18 years or older, and 3. live in the United States.

Completion of the survey will only take 10 minutes and is entirely online! You will be asked to answer a brief demographic questionnaire, a survey of psychosocial adjustment, and an inventory of sex behaviors; your completed responses will be anonymous. Upon completion, you will be eligible to win one of five $50 Visa gift cards. If you meet the criteria above and would like to participate, click the link below!

44,2017-08-12 02:29:13,6t5yao,5,13,"Hello Reddit,

I am turning to this community because I don't have any trans friends, and feel so low tonight that I am willing to set aside my hesitations to seek help. I apologize in advance for making this long and expositionary, but right now the internet might be my only hope for relief.

I came out to myself as ftm in January of this year. Reddit helped me a lot in terms of information and accepting myself, and the community over at /r/transforthememories encouraged me to examine my own past and accept just how many flags I had overlooked. My family isn't supportive, and many of my friends have been slow to start using he pronouns, using my ""new"" name, etc. I almost made a Facebook post about it today, but it feels kind of silly to make a fuss about something as personal as identity. It didnt seem like the right platform.

In March, I began to experience delusional thinking and paranoia. I was hospitalized twice, broke off my engagement, moved back in with my parents, and generally self isolated. I fell into deeper depression, turned to alcohol, dated my best friend because he was the only person I considered ""safe"", and would drive around for hours in a manic state looking for answers to questions I wasn't sure of. I am currently on Zyprexa and seeing a therapist.

This year has been a huge step forward for my identity, but shit in every other department. My delusions are less frequent now, but to some degree I believe they began as a result of the Trump presidency. I felt targetted. I didn't feel safe anywhere. And I certainly don't have an excess of people who understood where I was coming from as a transgender individual, even from psychological professionals.

So here I am, Reddit. I don't know where my body dysphoria and transness begins and the schizophrenia ends.. or vice versa. Does anyone have any information regarding a correlation between the two?  I am lost. Some times its hard to feel like suicide is not an eventuality. I don't know if I know how to become the person I was born to be.

Any advice or resources you can provide would be stellar. Thanks for existing, Reddit.",trans,Transgender and schizophrenic,1502530153.0,"{'created_utc': 1502504953, 'id': '6t5yao', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 13, 'selftext': 'Hello Reddit,\n\nI am turning to this community because I don\'t have any trans friends, and feel so low tonight that I am willing to set aside my hesitations to seek help.

I had my consultation March 20th. I was called by Julie (scheduling nurse) on May 31st telling me I was approved for Top Surgery through my Insurance. I had surgery on July 18th! :)
My insurance is Washington Apple Health, United Health Care. It paid for everything.
I checked in at 10am and surgery was around noon. It lasted about 3 hours. I stayed over night in the hospital per Dr. orders (it's the way she does things). 
Dr. Schmidek and her team are Amazing! They used the correct pronouns and name the whole time. I felt very respected by Schmidek and her team. When it came time to looking at my ""moobs"" to see what surgery was necessary and to draw on them she apologized for having to make me a bit uncomfortable and did what she had to do as fast and as professional as she could.
I will be recommending her to Anyone who asks. :)

I was seriously angry, but I went and google reverse searched it as well to look at it (dunno what for, to be angrier? To see the intent behind it other than the blatant ""stop being trans?""

The image is here [NSFW/NSFL/TRIGGER WARNING](http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1502869192186.jpg?__cf_waf_tk__=111289002Xx0T9ZLNMvUcWn5SjFTGiPzNoxM) (picture is of multiple posts showing the results of a presumably failed SRS, testimonies of people who regret their SRS, and then finally a few screencaps trying to say ""OP's transphobic family was just trying to help her"")  and honestly while it's mostly screencaps of reddit, naturally both results were hosted by motherfucking 4chan.

I don't even know what to reply, things were definitely cold (an understatement) between us but I hadn't blocked him. He had been posting shit about ""gender ideology harming children"" or some documentary about testosterone that I never even paid attention to but simply replied with a 🚫 to.. at some point I had enough of the transphobic stuff combined with the political texts and memes and shut him down hard/told him we were better off not talking. Last I heard of him was in May.

How should I even react? Chances are this sub is going to bring out the lynch mob (deserved, granted) but at the same time while I can explode at him and have before, I can kind of get how he feels as completely ignorant he might be.

Like honestly I'm wondering if this is some terribly planned olive branch to return things to somewhat how they were, I mean I'm definitely not going to accept it in this format but at this point but for all the ups and downs we've had (many, some my fault some not) I don't know how on earth to respond to this, if it is an olive branch at the most it's difficult to shoot down even if it's a filthy poisonous one.

The weirdest part of all is that only now I realise the truth behind being born with the wrong body.

I've never been interested in men, always known I was attracted to women. But always struggled in my relationships with women. (I always felt used. Like a sex toy).

I've always been a bit different, and in the last decade I've realized that I dont feel comfortable identifying as either straight, nor male. (Eventhough I like being a man physically, and know that I'm sexually attracted to women. Without telling anyone, I started identifying as a woman who likes women, born in a mans body but really perfectly fine with it...happy even).

Life has always felt too unnecessarily complex, on so many levels, but I'm 35 and for the first time ever I actually feel love (Its quite good). And  for the first time ever I feel human.

It's a relief to me that I found a home so to speak. That I don't have to worry about attempting the classical straight relationships anymore.

 I find that straight people are so overly complicated. Both cis men and cis women. And it's a relief to just be able to accept that that's how I feel. (And I don't have to be afraid of saying or thinking that anymore).

So many are complaining about frustrations, and pointing fingers, while other people are pretty much lost in life. But still try to see good in everyone, and still trying to ad something of value to society, eventhough we so often get told to fuck off one way or another.

You probably know who I am, we hung out with some friends on Halloween a few years ago. I was the medic, you were a homestuck character.

You were one of my only friends at that school. You really made a tough time in my life easier for me, and I took that for granted. I outwardly and flagrantly supported Trump on my Facebook and tried to push it on you, and I don't know if that was what made you delete your profile and unfriend me, but if it was, I'm sorry.

The truth is that I wasn't sure of my own identity and I'm still not. I was projecting and trying to make myself seem tougher to my hyper conservative parents and a friend that I had, and I don't believe *anything* that I said to you or on Facebook anymore. I don't think I did when I posted them either.

I'm not trying to get you to be friends with me again, I understand if you're angry at me, but I want to say that I'm very sorry.

I don't know if I hurt you and I hope that I didn't. But I feel so awful and guilty for it that I just had to get this off my chest. 

Just for identification so that you know it's you I'm posting about, if you're unsure and reading this, but you really liked Homestuck, you went as a character for Halloween, and your birthname was Brielle and I couldn't spell your last name (Sorry about that too, lol).

I originally came out to my mom about my gender about two years ago, and she was accepting but didn't really get it. She hasn't been great with my name and pronouns, but i only see here once or twice a year so it's not such a big deal. Yesterday she called me because she had found out i had started taking T. She tries to understand but she wasn't happy about it, and had a lot of misconceptions about me ""wanting to be a man."" I did my best to explain stuff, but i wasn't really prepared for the conversation and i kind of froze up.

16,2017-08-02 11:47:29,6r3m5k,24,22,"Hi all,
Sorry this is super long. Just reaching out to see if anyone has had a similar experience as me, as I feel I am going crazy atm. I am 29 years old, AMAB and started MtF HRT in 2015.

I guess when I first started exploring my gender identity around 25-26, I realised I had a lot of dysphoria around being male both socially and physically. At first I didn't even consider that I might be female, just not male in a traditional sense. I made changes to become more of a feminine/androgynous guy, sort of inspired by Bishounen anime character or the gender ambiguous Kpop/Jpop dudes in asian cultures. I wanted to look like a girl, almost to the stage of passing as one, be pretty and cute instead of handsome and masculine and be afforded alot of the social flexibilities that girls have over guys (around clothing etc.)

After making alot of non HRT changes (growing hair out, lasering facial hair, wearing makeup, dressing androgynously), people started to gender me as female on occasions. People referred to me as ""she"" or ""ladies"" when I was out with friends, held doors open for me etc. and tbh it made me feel really warm and fuzzy inside. I had started dating guys for the first time (I'm bi) and had my first boyfriend and when I was with him, I kind of felt like his girlfriend. He kind of picked up on it I think and he treated me like I was the female in the relationship (in a traditional gender role sense), he was really protective of me and it felt really nice :)

To the rest of the people in my life, my sort of gender ambiguity was seen as something really unique. No one thought I was trans, but I would get comments from people at work how I was ""bizarrely pretty for a guy"". I would wear makeup (mostly eyeliner) and cute unisex girls clothes, my old friends picked up on the makeup and told me ""it really suits you, for some reason"".

With all the feelings I had around being gendered female and looking at transition timelines of trans women and the effects of HRT, I became drawn to the idea of transitioning to female. I wasn't really 100% certain, but alot of signs were pointing to a good possibility that I was MtF and I really wanted to take hormones to further feminize myself. I went through the usual counselling and medical process to get HRT. My counsellor and I were fairly convinced I was female and would be happier making the transition. I started HRT and came out to my friends/family/work, which went surprisingly well, the majority of people were supportive and willing to work with me around pronouns, new name, bathrooms etc.

So I was on HRT and lived as a female full time for about a year. Overall I enjoyed the physical changes and being gendered female. The feelings of being on hormones made me feel alot more calmer and a bit warm and fuzzy. Howeve, my external life had become alot more awkward. I became a lot less confident in myself and became more negative about my body image, I put so much focus and energy and fear on passing. I went from being a fairly outgoing person to a bit of recluse, I wouldn't go out as much in public for fear of people staring at me and for someone who was previously extroverted and chatty, I stopped talking to people because I felt my voice was too deep. I also didn't know who I was anymore, I was trying so hard to bury my old male self but at the same time felt like I lost my familiar base, I didn't know how to be a woman. Life would fluctuate between feeling happy about obtaining my girl self, but for the most part just stressful and scary.

Overtime the initial coming out excitement wore off, I burn't out, spiraled into a pretty bad depression and ended up in hospital. What helped me recover was realising that I actually missed my old guy self, not the old old ""trying to fit in as a man"" guy self, but the pre-coming out androgynous/bishounen/girly guy self. By putting in so much energy to suppress that part of me to gain acceptance as a female as well as living in an almost non-genuine way to change into some kind of self perceived stereotype of a female, I was causing myself almost a reverse dysphoria. I also began to wonder whether transition was a mistake.

Anyway I stopped HRT, decided I wanted to detransition and went back to dressing as a guy (confusing a lot of people in the process). I felt relieved to let go of the pressure of passing, just rolled out of bed in the morning and throw on jeans and a tshirt, I could speak to people again because...who cares about my voice. My confidence began to come back. My friends continued to treat me as a female and use she/her pronouns and all of that still made me feel nice. After being off HRT for a while I began to feel anxiety, mostly around re-masculinizing and aging as a male (losing my hair, soft features and skin etc.). I hated when my male sex drive kicked in and overall i felt gross in my body. My desires around wanting to be perceived as female also started to return. So I went back on HRT and kind of switched between a boy and a girl mode depending on how confident I felt and what I felt like wearing day-to-day.

After a while my breasts began to grow, not huge (like an A cup), but big enough to be noticeable. I couldnt wear tight shirts and I certainly felt naked when I was topless (which sucked because I grew up on the beach and loved surfing without a shirt). Tbh I hate having breasts most of the time, they feel like really alien and I feel unattractive and awkward having them. I bind them using a tight sports bra most of the time. There are occasions when I do like them, when I'm feeling deeply female and I'm wearing a dress or top that needs filling out, also when I'm at home in my pjs I feel really cute. The biggest time I enjoy them is during sex, the sensations feel amazing and when I'm with a partner I feel like the female in bed. I've never enjoyed sex when I felt like a male.
So over the last year I've cycled on and off hormones. I go off them usually because the breast growth freaks me out and then back on them when the anxiety, ""gross in my body"", ""fear of masculine features returning"" feelings come back. Right atm I am living as my bishounen guy self the majority of the time and bind my chest, I even cut my hair mid length into a cute androgynous style, which has made me feel alot happier. I still have many days or longer periods of time where I really girl up and am happy being seen as female. I am really unsure what to do going from here, whether to go back on HRT forever or stay off them, I'm worried the cycling I'm doing will cause me health problems long term and my endo isn't experienced with someone doing that. My breasts still worry me, I've done some research on top surgery recently and I would be eligible for keyhole because they arn't very big. At the same time I wonder if I would regret having them removed sometimes.

The only other thing that bothers me is that I feel I lost something that was unique to me when I came out as transgender, which I can never get back. I truly miss being that ambiguous guy who was bending all the gender rules, now I feel my unique identity has been taken off me in some way and placed under the transgender label. I don't mean that in a negative way, but that could be partly some internalized transphobia at play. I guess when I was exploring, people saw me as a quirky confident David Bowie type, I was messing with peoples heads and people saw me as one of a kind, ""I don't know what's going on, but he is kind of cool"". After I came out: ""oh she's like Caitlyn Jenner"" or ""I saw a trans story on 60 minutes, you are so brave"", ""it must be so hard"". If I could do it over, I would transition and switch genders without ever coming out and I think my friends would have gone along with that.",genderqueer,"Possibly genderfluid/non-binary, really confused and can't make my mind up about HRT and regret coming out",1501699649.0,"{'created_utc': 1501674449, 'id': '6r3m5k', 'num_comments': 24, 'score': 22, 'selftext': 'Hi all,\nSorry this is super long.

The pressure of being a man again is affecting me so bad (not to feel like transitioning over again),I try hard to be the man I want to be but it seems like I am never enough man...I don't like stereotypical ""man's stuff"" (sports,cars,beer,training,even...girls) I just accepted me as a guy again,a gay guy. I know that as a gay guy I can be as feminine as I want to,but I'm not feminine, yes,I don't like ""masculine"" things and I know more about ""girl's stuff "", I'm right in the middle, I'm not manly or girly enough so now I don't fit in any place;girl's one I get it,I'm a guy and they feel weird,I feel weird too now that I am presenting as a guy again, I'm not a feminine gay guy,I'm not like that at all,I am like an average guy with no manly tastes; I want to have male friends and obviously a boyfriend, but I'm not ""acting"" man enough... 
What should I do? Will I ever be able to find friends like me?A boyfriend?Will I like them? Are there guys like me out there?

38,2017-08-07 04:44:14,6s3e7j,18,22,"Hi there. I'm a butch/tomboy/stag whatever you'd like to call it--AFAB, pretty much cis but with a masc flair. Suits, flannels, no makeup, snapbacks every day, you name it.

And, nah, I'm not trans or genderqueer. I've looked into that, more than once. Shit, sometimes I wonder if that would be better--at least I'd know what the hell is going on with me...better yet, I'd have recourse to stop feeling like shit.

I dress masc, and that's usually enough to keep me feeling good about myself. But on days like this, I see really masc guys and I just feel like shit about myself. I'm not tall enough, not big enough, not strong enough or schooled enough in ""dude know-how"" to hang with a lot of guys. 

I have some friends that are dudes, (not that I choose my friends by gender) but largely they intimidate me. Testosterone is a helluva drug, and it freaks me out that most guys I encounter have the ability to fuck me up if they so chose and I couldn't do much about it. I have crushes on dudes, but I get so freaked that I usually just stick to pursuing girls.

So when I dress the way I do, I feel like I'm dressing as something I'm not--I might look like a guy, but that's where the similarities stop. I'm pretty different from most dudes after that, as much as I hate to think about it. It wouldn't be so bad if I fit in really well with more girls, but I don't do that well either.

I feel like I'm just a random mix of masculine and feminine shit, nothing fits together well. Sometimes I just wish I were different, something less complicated. Maybe a badass butch lesbian or a femme straight girl. Instead, I'm a bisexual tomboy with a complex about it. I hate talking this way, but I can't help feeling like a pretender. 

I dunno what I hope to gain from posting this, but I guess some insight or even some solidarity would be helpful. I feel alone in this: all the people I've talked to didn't get what I was talking about.

Shit, sometimes I wonder if that would be better--at least I\'d know what the hell is going on with me...better yet, I\'d have recourse to stop feeling like shit.\n\nI dress masc, and that\'s usually enough to keep me feeling good about myself. But on days like this, I see really masc guys and I just feel like shit about myself. I\'m not tall enough, not big enough, not strong enough or schooled enough in ""dude know-how"" to hang with a lot of guys. \n\nI have some friends that are dudes, (not that I choose my friends by gender) but largely they intimidate me. Testosterone is a helluva drug, and it freaks me out that most guys I encounter have the ability to fuck me up if they so chose and I couldn\'t do much about it. I have crushes on dudes, but I get so freaked that I usually just stick to pursuing girls.\n\nSo when I dress the way I do, I feel like I\'m dressing as something I\'m not--I might look like a guy, but that\'s where the similarities stop. I\'m pretty different from most dudes after that, as much as I hate to think about it. It wouldn\'t be so bad if I fit in really well with more girls, but I don\'t do that well either.\n\nI feel like I\'m just a random mix of masculine and feminine shit, nothing fits together well. Sometimes I just wish I were different, something less complicated. Maybe a badass butch lesbian or a femme straight girl. Instead, I\'m a bisexual tomboy with a complex about it. I hate talking this way, but I can\'t help feeling like a pretender. \n\nI dunno what I hope to gain from posting this, but I guess some insight or even some solidarity would be helpful. I feel alone in this: all the people I\'ve talked to didn\'t get what I was talking about.

If I offend please know that is not the intent, in my generation and more importantly my family, talking about sexuality is pretty much non-starter.  I am a man and need to marry a woman and create babies, that is the purpose in life; that was pretty much the talk I was given when I was having some issues as a teen.  I have been repressed pretty much since then (I am almost 50 now).

I am trying to do some more research about my sexuality but cannot correctly identify the term to search for.  I am a male attracted to masculinity (androsexual).  As my close friend put it, I like my women manly.  However, I am also attracted to Transsexual females (gender assigned males that identify as female) that retain the masculine physical presence.   

The commonality between these two is the body type, they have to have masculine physicality while presenting as female.  In other words, no beards or hairy legs but have abs, quads and strong backs.  

I am a masculine guy, lots of gym activities, I like very physical sports (snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing, etc...) but feel like sexually I am very feminine.

63,2017-08-11 01:29:30,6sxxt9,15,6,"This is probably going to end up ridiculously long and tangential. Sorry!?!


AFAB, late-twenties, I basically define myself as ""queer as fuck"" for lack of better words. I am surrounded by queer and trans* folk. My church is welcoming, my friends are welcoming, the larger activist community is welcoming, I spend a good portion of my time in a fairly progressive city (although I do live in a slightly more conservative, but not too bad, smaller town next to the city.)


I just feel like I am running into complications that would prevent me from living like *me*. I don't know what to call myself, but I know a few things for sure. 


I feel like my breasts are the absolute worst thing about my body. They're huge, DD. I wish I could just wake up tomorrow and them be gone. I feel like a lost cause because no matter what else I do as long as those *things* are attached to my body it won't matter. I have severe back pain, neuropathy, sciatica, and asthma. Is it even safe to bind? Like, is it going to make me hurt worse or make it even harder to breathe? I know sometimes if you have very large breasts and chronic pain you can get a reduction. I wonder sometimes if I could convince my doctor that it is medically necessary for that reason alone and not even mention the dysphoria, would they even ""let"" you go down to nothing? I don't know if Medicaid would cover it for either reason though. Plus, as someone with rather severe mental illness, one of my biggest fears in life is surgery. I've been putting off surgery on my back for years for fear and I don't even know if I could make myself do this even though I absolutely hate having breasts. Plus, I'm fat. I'm around 220 and only five feet tall. I'm working on losing weight, but I'm so freakin' depressed that it's hard. I feel like people are going to look at me so weird for having a big old belly/hip and not having *anything* at my chest (either binding or surgery.)


Oh yeah, that's another thing, hips. Damn. I wish I could lose this weight so badly, but I physically and mentally hurt so badly that it is literally hard to move around. The hips ""give it away"" too.


And the hair. I have long hair. Past my shoulders, it's always in a ponytail or bun because I can't be bothered with it. It's super curly. I was just watching some Ash Hardell videos for the first time today and what they said made perfect sense about their hair and dysphoria. One of the reasons I don't just hack it all off is that I'm afraid I will hate it even more than I hate having long hair. I'm afraid it will look ridiculous and I'll be stuck with it until it grows out, partially just because I'm afraid I'll pick the wrong style, but also (again) I'm fat and it's hard to pick the right hairstyles plus my hair is really blonde and for some reason it seems like it's harder to make short blonde hair look good (to me).


Clothing: So, I hate femme clothing. I do not wear any skirts or dresses. I usually walk around in t-shirts and jeans. ""Men's"" clothes don't usually work for me because the chest/hips/belly/shortness so I end up in ""women's"" jeans which is also annoying to me. I also wish I could dress nicer than just t-shirts and jeans, but nothing fits and I can't pull of the majority of semi-dressy button up shirts out there because they're usually plaid of some sort and I end up looking less masculine and more like I'm trying to present butch, which really isn't what I'm going for. 


Hormonal stuff: I loathe having periods. I am trying to get my birth control (which is unnecessary at this point due to my not having sex with someone who can get me pregnant) changed to something that will stop them. I try to keep my voice lower because I don't like the way I sound, but it's definitely not low enough. People still call me ma'am on the phone, even if I don't tell them my name. It's not feminine, but it's definitely not feminine either. (And singing... I love to sing, even though I'm terrible at it, but there goes the low voice out the window.) I don't think I could ever go on T because I have dermatillomania and to a far lesser extent trichotillomania. (I pick my skin and pull my hair.) I have a decent amount of really short chin and mustache hairs already. My mental illness causes me to stand in front of a mirror for extended periods of time plucking if I notice even the slightest feeling of hair coming in. I can't imagine actively trying to grow hair, I feel like I'd never leave the mirror. Which leads me back to, I don't feel like I'm ever going to be able to fully present as a masculine person and it depresses me all over. 


There's probably a whole lot more I could say, but this is basically just free-writing, I need to talk to someone and can't wait any longer kind of thing.


Now, why don't I try to take steps toward a presentation that fits me better?


First off, I'm poor. I can't even afford to buy clothes. I am disabled and waiting on SSI (on a medical leave from work until my doctors say I'm ""better."") My wardrobe basically has to be hand me down and the only people who really give me anything are my sister (and it's always super femme) or my cousin that I live with and it's always super out of style for any gender. I can't afford a binder, I can't afford to keep my hair cut short if I ever go there, I can't afford anything.


Also, I've pared down the number of people I talk to in my family. Out of my dozen or so aunts and uncles and over 40 cousins, my father and my only remaining grandparent, I talk to my sister's, my grandmother and my cousin. But I rely on them so much. I am not in a place right now where I can possibly live on my own, definitely not until SSI goes through. My grandmother still refers to my cousin who has been out as queer and not explicitly out as trans (because my grandmother would not wrap her head around that) but presents male and uses a ""male"" name, etc as their dead name and calls them ""girl/woman"" and it's been a good ten years. I wish I could just leave my grandmother out of my life, but my daughter is *SO* attached to her. My grandmother would disown me and probably try to take her away if I were to say I was queer/GNC. My grandmother is 77 and has Stage 4 Cancer, so she doesn't have much longer anyway, but I can't rip the two of them apart. They love each other too much, plus my grandmother adopted me when I was younger and has let me live with her many times when I was homeless.


My sister and cousin are both members of more conservative denominations of Christianity. They both profess to be accepting of LGBTQ+ people and I know my sister at least supports queer causes and has queer friends, I don't know how far my cousin takes it other than ""God loves everyone"" and ""Everyone deserves equal rights"". I cannot lose either of them. I love them both dearly as people, and for what they've done for me and my daughter. I live with my cousin and have nowhere else to go plus I feel like she needs me around to do things for her (she's got a disability as well that hinders her more than mine does me.) 

Now, my family of creation is large and amazing (as I sort of alluded to above.) I'm not saying this in a way like it's a competition or anything, but I probably associate with far more GNC/Trans* folk than I do cis-folk and nearly everyone I know is under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, so they would all support me in anything. It's just these three people I'm worried about. Well, and society. 

So yeah, I feel stuck right now. I don't think I can do anything and it really hurts. Any tips, advice, or general support would be greatly welcomed. ",genderqueer,Can I Just Vent?

* I was initially uncomfortable the first time I had to change in a locker room in middle school. I got over it, but I always go into a corner away from others when changing, and try to do it as quickly as possible so others don’t see me shirtless.
* I never use urinals in public bathrooms (and often I can’t go at all if someone else is nearby).
* I was never aggressive or competitive growing up, like adolescent boys are seemingly expected to be.
* Sometimes when I am in a stressful situation I start to cry, even if I don’t always know why. I’m glad more people are realizing that the notion of “men shouldn’t show emotions” is ridiculous.
* I have always been upset when I hear about U.S. Selective Service (registering for a wartime draft), because they say it’s a thing all *men* have to do just because you are a *man*. I’m too weak emotionally to be a soldier. I couldn’t kill someone. Even though I know a draft won’t happen because the age of boots-on-the-ground warfare is over and drones and cyberwarfare are the future, it still scares me.
* I have always wanted to wear a women's one piece swimsuit, even though I know it wouldn't work because my junk would be obvious. I'm not exactly ""well-endowed"" down there, but it's enough. I don't really like to swim anymore because it means I have to wear trunks and go shirtless.
* I recently bought a few skirts and leggings on Amazon, and like the look more than pants. I haven't worn them outside my room yet, because my parent's don't know.
* My younger sister is non-binary, and both them and I get upset when my parents use ""her"" pronouns.

And the thought of all the work and risks of transitioning medically makes my head spin. The side effects of HRT, as well as having to get regular blood tests, is intimidating to me. My voice isn't super deep, but unmistakably masculine. I *hate* my growing body hair.

I want to grow my hair long enough to put in a ponytail, and dress more androgynous. I'm bisexual, but I want close friends more than I want a romantic relationship. What worries me is that I still wish I was born female, but am too afraid to fully transition.

However, growing up I never really put much thought into gender, I didn't really know that was a thing I could do haha but going back to 5th/6th grade I always felt so different and broken. It was scary and sort of a relief when I fully grasped and understood what it meant to be transgender. I know I'm definitely not cis and I came out to my parents in July as transgender (did not go well, they love me but don't accept me...) thinking that I wanted to transition and that I was probably fully female just going through a lot of denial. Afterwards I had decided that non-binary trans feminine would be the best term to describe me, but I think I sort of drifted more towards just binary woman later on. But recently after some really low days (why do I always have to hit rock bottom to finally understand myself more...), I started thinking back about my being non-binary and the fluidity of gender. 

I'm thinking now that I'm certainly non-binary but also a bit genderfluid in that for the most part I enjoy feeling agender but there are times where I feel very feminine and want to very much be a girl, so I fluctuate between the two. And while I don't necessarily hate my appearance, I just don't like being viewed as a guy. I wish I could just be read as gender neutral but I don't think I could ever accomplish that at least not without transitioning. Because ultimately I'd prefer to be read as female rather than male. Like I'd certainly like and probably enjoy a more female form with breasts and fat distributed to the butt and hips. And I feel like I'd be a lot happier that way. Because I know as non-binary I can certainly transition but I guess I just wanted to see if there was anyone that could relate to anything of this who has been transitioning and how have you felt about your transition?

I think the only hang ups I really have about transitioning at this point are:

- loss of fertility (but I think if I just bank sperm that should suffice)

- possible loss of friends and family (really unsure how my two cis male roommates would react especially)

- potential awkwardness transitioning at work (though luckily I work for a very LGBTQ friendly company, and there are quite a few people transitioning currently)

- fear that I'll just end up forever looking like a guy with breasts (I like the breast part but not the guy part)

- constant fear of facing hatred and discrimination just for existing.

If I were to change my pronouns at this point, I would just add on they/ them/ theirs and still use she/ her/ hers, but I realize that might be confusing for some people? I don't know what that makes me, really.

I'm just going to jump right into some things. It was discovered that I have a hormonal imbalance.  I have an abnormally high testosterone count (like 113 or something) for a woman and I wasn't getting my period because of it (I don't have PCOS or any tumors, it's just abnormally high for unknown reasons - any insight as to why that could be and if that could be affecting me?). I only get my period when I'm on birth control at this point. I went back on birth control, got my period, and I was a wreck the whole month with emotions and got really bad dysphoria with my period. Like it was this foreign thing that I shouldn't be getting. I've had that a lot in the past, and I don't know if it's because I have gone really long stretches without getting it, or if it's connected to concerns about gender, or if it's because it's normal for women to hate their period. But it just didn't feel right. I was supposed to keep taking birth control, but I didn't, and didn't tell my doctor. I even asked to go on a different medication, not even voicing my concerns completely, just saying that my emotions and migraines were out of control. But now she says this other medication (metformin, which is actually a medication for diabetes, which I don't have but helps balance hormones) might give me my period, and it might help me lose weight  - but now I'm thinking of asking to just go back on the birth control or do nothing because even though I need help losing weight (huge issue for me), it's not worth having my period and not having the option to skip it.

Another thing. TW: I was raped about a year ago. It really messed me up bad. I have PTSD because of it. I'm in therapy and see a psychiatrist. I was already doing that but it also caused me to be hospitalized three or four times. I've already struggled with depression, anxiety, and past abuse. Anyway, I wonder if some ""dysphoria"" I have with my breasts could actually be tied to the rape and how bruised they got, and how maybe it's just a huge trigger now. I used to be fine with that part of me. It now just makes me feel terrible when anyone is looking at my chest or sexualizing me as a woman. I never feel like a guy but I kind of want to disappear, even though at the same time I wish my boyfriend and I were having sex even though our sex life is non-existent and we're poly, and I'm scared to even try to seek out someone else.

Lately I've looked up binders and wondered how that would make me feel. I never want to be a guy. However, sometimes I really feel uncomfortable with my womanly features, or at least my chest and my long hair (I'm trying to get my hair cut really soon into some sort of side cut asymmetrical bob I think), and from what I've seen online/ on tinder, I'm really attracted to women/ people who have androgynous looking genders? I hope that doesn't sound offensive. I find myself being attracted but also wishing I looked like that and wanting to emulate it. I wonder if this is a new thing or if it's been there for a long time and I'm just now acknowledging it. I've always struggled with what to wear when I go out and some days I've dressed a certain way but some days I've dressed in a way that makes me ""comfortable"" and it leans more towards androgynous. 

I have found myself lately wanting more androgynous clothing and wanting to look that way more? I've reasoned it to not wanting excess attention from guys and it being a comfort thing but I don't know if it's necessarily a negative thing in that way. I don't know if maybe it means that I just feel more comfortable being androgynous. Sometimes I still like dressing up but a lot of the time I don't. Idk.

But at the same time, I love makeup?

I think a lot of disappointment in my body is weight related. Maybe I'd be more comfortable being womanly if I wasn't overweight. But I'm not sure. Also a lot of it is related to my sexuality I feel like, and having finally come out as bisexual after hiding for so long. I feel more comfortable dressing a certain way, maybe not as feminine, because I don't have to necessarily hide who I am.

I\'ve reasoned it to not wanting excess attention from guys and it being a comfort thing but I don\'t know if it\'s necessarily a negative thing in that way. I don\'t know if maybe it means that I just feel more comfortable being androgynous. Sometimes I still like dressing up but a lot of the time I don\'t. Idk.\n\nBut at the same time, I love makeup?\n\nI think a lot of disappointment in my body is weight related. Maybe I\'d be more comfortable being womanly if I wasn\'t overweight. But I\'m not sure. Also a lot of it is related to my sexuality I feel like, and having finally come out as bisexual after hiding for so long. I feel more comfortable dressing a certain way, maybe not as feminine, because I don\'t have to necessarily hide who I am.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into if any of this makes me genderqueer or if there\'s something else going on? Does anyone have any advice for me? I really don\'t know what to think.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Am I genderqueer, did my trauma just mess me up, or am I just not okay with my body?

https://www.facebook.com/TheYoungTurks/videos/10154933026894205/

Don't get me wrong.  I'm a fan of TYT and very much love Hasan Piker's takedown of Adam Calhoun, who was bashing @makeupbyjack, a 10 year old UK boy who is a phenom makeup prodigy.  But one thing that got to me a little bit was when Piker asserted ""...as if this kid's life won't be hard enough..."".  Some of it was me struggling with my 10 year old self who longed to be the kind of amazing soul that Jack has become  It is also a ""ugh"" implying that Hasan subtly agrees with Adam on some level that Jack is going to have a tough choice because of his ""lifestyle"".  

I guess I'm just sick and tired of cisgendered men placing non-binary people, AMAB's in particular, into a box.  Sure Jack can grow up to be a very femme gay man, but he can also grow into whatever sexuality and gender suits him best.  He can be a killer at makup arts and also grow into a hardcore martial artist who can kick the crap out of anybody who dare threatens him, but still go for a spa day with his gal pals.

EDIT: Also, possible Trigger warning I'm realizing for sexual assault! Sorry!

I'm AFAB and genderfluid. I've known that for more than a decade after realizing I was not, in fact, a transman as I originally thought. I do identify more with the masculine than the feminine, even though I appear feminine. (Despite my best attempts, androgyny is beyond me.) Over the last few years, I've been working to actively embrace my feminine self as well. In general, I've become comfortable with both sides of myself, but today I'm having a weird issue. I don't know any other genderfluid people, and so, I'm posting here to see if anyone else might relate. Or if I'm maybe offbase on my theory. Or for support. I'm ... actually not really sure. 

So, the background story. I was walking in my city, and a man pulled over next to me on the street, got out of his car, and sexually assaulted me. It wasn't violent, but it was pushy and insistent, and it freaked me out. I had to push him away repeatedly, duck and move quickly, and he still tried to pull me away with him. I got away, and I've reported it to the police and charges have been pressed, but it's left me feeling uneasy.

I was dressed (and feeling) quite feminine, which is relatively unusual for me. But I've been trying to do that more often. He talked about liking ""women like me"" and described physical traits he liked about me, which managed to trigger some dysphoria too. 

Now, I feel anxious around men. I mean, all men. Men that are friends, family, coworkers, and all around genuinely good people I've known, in some cases, my entire life. I know I don't need to be afraid of them, so I know that it's anxiety. It may be important to know that I do have social anxiety disorder, so this isn't completely unexpected or out of left field. Some of it's familiar even. It's just odd (for me) to feel it around a particular gender instead of, well, everyone. I talked to a friend who'd been assaulted in the past and she told me she'd had the same feeling, so I accepted that it was probably ""normal"" or whatever, and figured it would go away when it goes away. I wasn't anxious around women or when alone, so as annoying as it is, I figured I could deal.

But today ... I feel very particularly masculine. I don't know if all genderfluid people are like this, but some days I feel passively one or the other gender and it changes, or kind of neither, and then some days I feel *particularly* one gender or the other. Today, I feel like a man. And I've been anxious since the second I woke up. Now, I'm sitting at my desk at work, and there's no men here ... except me. And I feel anxious. I couldn't figure it out. And then I had a thought.

... am I making myself feel anxious? Is that really where I'm at? Has anyone else ever experienced this? I can't think of what else it could be ...

Greetings, fellow human beings! I wanted to add the word lovely just before the word fellow, but I don't know how many people feel comfortable with this - since ""just because I feel comfortable with [insert thing], that doesn't mean everyone else will"" and yata yata. Anyhow, sorry for the mini tangent I'll just let it go with your existence is something that matters and is a pleasant thing existing in the universe. Now, moving on, I just thought I would leave a little life update here out of excitement. Feel free to ignore this, as it will probably be rambling even if [by some off chance and/or miracle] this turns out short. In fact, here's the cut off line! (Aka, click your backspace buttons now if you aren't up for good and/or random news).

Now, it has been a very long time since I posted here. As it turns out, my social anxiety wasn't ready for being in another minority community and I didn't have the usual logic to talk down that fear, despite being out both to [those ultimately significantly more important within my] immediate family and close friends. To cut it short: talking to strangers is still too difficult. So, to combat this in a continued effort to be more social and involved, I more or less gave up here and tried out the Gender Amino. I was just more familiar with it since I used it for being involved in the KPOP (or [K]orean [Pop] music) and Kdrama (or [K]orean ""soap opera"") community, so it wasn't a problem getting use to the format and in the end it turned out to be a better fit for me. I rarely ever use my cellphone, often forgetting it exists even until I need to make a call, check the time, or set some alarm - which is always a big shock for everyone as someone in my early 20s, so it was nice using the app and getting use to my phone more. I realized the negative effect on my wrist quickly as I got more involved, making me recall the good old days of having a literal physical keyboard attached to my phones but that's another story for another time. Basically, I got to be the ""good old hippie/Mother-Theresa"" figure I am and got to give a lot of seemingly helpful advice - but before I move on my anxiety is screaming to say sorry to anyone that offended (religious or otherwise) with that ""nickname""/label. I have a tendency to have these kinds of overly-nurturing labels attached to myself most of the time by other people and thought that choice of words would better exploit that fact since you're reading this through a screen without having seen the actual actions associated. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

But anyway, the main point here is that it was great for me and my worrying mother instincts for random strangers. I got to talk to a variety of people, confused and otherwise, and it felt nice to give them some grounding. For a long time now I have felt this kind of thing was my calling, as corny as that sounds. I actually tend to be good at this kind of thing (that being giving others some form of closure in life), so it feels good and right to exercise this talent somewhere. Due to social anxiety and depression I don't often communicate or socialize with other people aside from my online instances with close friends, so helping others closer to acquaintances or strangers is fulfilling - and this app is great for that. While it may not be anonymous, there is advice, support, and love coming from every angle through all the advice-seeking or emotional support-needing posts because we all understand being different in gender (although truly it might take a while to get some feedback, unless its from me or a few other specific people since a handful of us are always haunting around it feels like). So, I would love to encourage anyone here to join. The bad, the good, the boring - it's all welcomed there. Much like here, its all free to share and free to engage without the need to be too active or barely active. Just, ya know, mobile.

Getting to the good stuff, in an effort to keep spreading that good internal peace and continue to stubbornly not give up on a dying dream, I am writing a book. I have made efforts towards my makeshift forced dream of being an author literally since childhood, but more often than not I struggle to find individuality as a writer and give up due mainly to dissatisfaction in my writing skill despite small success here and there. I decided to abandon this many years ago once the anxiety got bad and a great fear of having actual readers that weren't classmates or certain people in my family set in out of no where, yet here we are and once again here I am back struggling with my fingertips over the keys. Surprisingly enough, however, I've got several chapters of this book written so far and it's going well. While I wasn't expecting this progression, I'm not unhappy or at all overwhelmed with it. It's taken me a very long time to accept a change in this goal - how I'm going to write, what I'm going to write about, how I could make people care enough to read it from my perspective as the author instead of the reader. I went through several years of forming different styles with the help of my many fanfictions (I know, I know, but trust me there are some fanfiction that are true masterpieces). I honestly don't think I have grasped a certain style just yet, but I've found a way to be comfortable and accepting towards my writing and expectations. I just didn't think it would actually work out, doubtful depression aside. I never thought I would be able to write seriously again and enjoy/approve of it (I am my own worst critic, as most of us are, but my depression is also a harsh judge). But somehow I have been able to so far and its all working out. Somehow this is going well, skill aside. My planning foresight is still an advantage as well, I've got all kinds of things prepared long term and I'm almost overjoyed. So, while things are in full swing for the time being, I just thought I would come to announce the good news. If it actually ends up getting finished, you'll be the first to know after my editors and beta-readers(?). Just to finish this little section up, I also want to announce the subject of the book. Continuing with the corniness, it is a book about being genderfluid (as well as nonbinary, lesbian in a different kind of relationship, asexual, bisexual, pansexual, and other things I'm missing that my mind blanked out on). I know, I know, but I said I like helping people with self-acceptance, right? Besides, they always say ""write what you know"", right? So, as a writer, this is just what I plan to do. But have no deep seeded worries, this won't at all be a self-help book - because personally I can't stand those. It will be character and group focused and contain an actual story line from their many different perspectives in this world with these many different identities. And yes, I am avidly doing my research despite being able to understand and relate to most of these genders/sexualities as a genderfluid pansexual. Because after all, perspective is still everything.

And now to bring this to an end, I'm sorry it was pretty long and pretty informally written. I wish I could have written this a whole lot better, but I honestly wasn't planning on writing any of this at all in the first place. It was a sort of impulse decision, meaning I won't be editing too much of it either. Well, at least until the book goes on the market. Then you might want to expect this entire post to look a little more professional just because of my insecurity to appear as well-put as possible (especially privately and/or personally - and this counts as both for me). Anyway, if you got this far for some unknown reason, thank you for reading. I appreciate you wasting your time on this little update. I'm glad to be back, although I probably won't be around here any more than I already am. Now, back to catching up on those threads...

{EDIT} I forgot to add this into the mix, but I finally wore my packer after weeks of having it. There were some issues with getting packing underwear, but that's finally done and over with so I got to try it out. To sum up the experience and spare your eyes: I felt giddy. It was a magical experience. All I did was walk around my empty at the time house and wonder how those with biological penis deal with having balls. I am now looking into buying a cloth packer, or really just a cheap [but preferably still of good quality] packer, and probably some ""Joeys"" packer holders to sleep in - as sleeping in the ReelMagik soft version packers is not a good idea from what I can gather from others with the same quality packer.

Anyhow, sorry for the mini tangent I\'ll just let it go with your existence is something that matters and is a pleasant thing existing in the universe. Now, moving on, I just thought I would leave a little life update here out of excitement. Feel free to ignore this, as it will probably be rambling even if [by some off chance and/or miracle] this turns out short. In fact, here\'s the cut off line!

As it turns out, my social anxiety wasn\'t ready for being in another minority community and I didn\'t have the usual logic to talk down that fear, despite being out both to [those ultimately significantly more important within my] immediate family and close friends. To cut it short: talking to strangers is still too difficult. So, to combat this in a continued effort to be more social and involved, I more or less gave up here and tried out the Gender Amino. I was just more familiar with it since I used it for being involved in the KPOP (or [K]orean [Pop] music) and Kdrama (or [K]orean ""soap opera"") community, so it wasn\'t a problem getting use to the format and in the end it turned out to be a better fit for me. I rarely ever use my cellphone, often forgetting it exists even until I need to make a call, check the time, or set some alarm - which is always a big shock for everyone as someone in my early 20s, so it was nice using the app and getting use to my phone more. I realized the negative effect on my wrist quickly as I got more involved, making me recall the good old days of having a literal physical keyboard attached to my phones but that\'s another story for another time. Basically, I got to be the ""good old hippie/Mother-Theresa"" figure I am and got to give a lot of seemingly helpful advice - but before I move on my anxiety is screaming to say sorry to anyone that offended (religious or otherwise) with that ""nickname""/label. I have a tendency to have these kinds of overly-nurturing labels attached to myself most of the time by other people and thought that choice of words would better exploit that fact since you\'re reading this through a screen without having seen the actual actions associated. \n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nBut anyway, the main point here is that it was great for me and my worrying mother instincts for random strangers. I got to talk to a variety of people, confused and otherwise, and it felt nice to give them some grounding. For a long time now I have felt this kind of thing was my calling, as corny as that sounds. I actually tend to be good at this kind of thing (that being giving others some form of closure in life), so it feels good and right to exercise this talent somewhere. Due to social anxiety and depression I don\'t often communicate or socialize with other people aside from my online instances with close friends, so helping others closer to acquaintances or strangers is fulfilling - and this app is great for that. While it may not be anonymous, there is advice, support, and love coming from every angle through all the advice-seeking or emotional support-needing posts because we all understand being different in gender (although truly it might take a while to get some feedback, unless its from me or a few other specific people since a handful of us are always haunting around it feels like). So, I would love to encourage anyone here to join. The bad, the good, the boring - it\'s all welcomed there. Much like here, its all free to share and free to engage without the need to be too active or barely active. Just, ya know, mobile. \n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nGetting to the good stuff, in an effort to keep spreading that good internal peace and continue to stubbornly not give up on a dying dream, I am writing a book. I have made efforts towards my makeshift forced dream of being an author literally since childhood, but more often than not I struggle to find individuality as a writer and give up due mainly to dissatisfaction in my writing skill despite small success here and there. I decided to abandon this many years ago once the anxiety got bad and a great fear of having actual readers that weren\'t classmates or certain people in my family set in out of no where, yet here we are and once again here I am back struggling with my fingertips over the keys. Surprisingly enough, however, I\'ve got several chapters of this book written so far and it\'s going well. While I wasn\'t expecting this progression, I\'m not unhappy or at all overwhelmed with it. It\'s taken me a very long time to accept a change in this goal - how I\'m going to write, what I\'m going to write about, how I could make people care enough to read it from my perspective as the author instead of the reader. I went through several years of forming different styles with the help of my many fanfictions (I know, I know, but trust me there are some fanfiction that are true masterpieces). I honestly don\'t think I have grasped a certain style just yet, but I\'ve found a way to be comfortable and accepting towards my writing and expectations. I just didn\'t think it would actually work out, doubtful depression aside. I never thought I would be able to write seriously again and enjoy/approve of it (I am my own worst critic, as most of us are, but my depression is also a harsh judge).

I just found this subreddit and I thought maybe some of you might have advice? I started questioning my gender about 7/8 months ago and didn't take long to realise I was genderfluid once I found out about it. The thing is, I haven't been out about it other than to my twin and people online, because I know my mum( who doesn't mean to but says a lot of transphobic stuff, and doesn't think that nonbinary identities are a thing) would not accept it, and be upset. 
Thing is, about 3 months ago, I started dating a friend of mine, and I want to tell her. I have no reason to think she'll react badly - she's wonderful and accepting and we've had conversations about how awful transphobia is before and so on. But I'm just so scared - especially as one of the few people I told reacted badly at first. I'm also worried she'll be upset I didn't tell her sooner, but I've been trying. I'm just so worried. She thinks she's dating a girl and I feel like I'm lying to her, every time I go along with it because I'm not a girl, at least not a lot of the time. I just don't know what to do. 
I know this is probably silly, I was just hoping that someone might have some advice, either in telling her or helping her not feel like I don't trust her, because I do, I'm just a coward. Too many people are unaccepting and it terrifies me.

61,2017-08-28 10:14:31,6wihkg,2,9,"Hi,

So all my life I've felt okay with being boy. Since I was a child I've always wanted to be a girl, but I haven't had any massive issues with being male as far as I'm aware of.

However... lately I've been going to the gym to keep fit, but I've also been attempting to bulk up. Today whilst at the gym I felt a momentary, intense panic at the thought of becoming more muscular. I've always had a slim body type, and the prospect of losing this body type, of becoming more physically masculine in appearance and moving away from a more typically feminine frame, made me scared. The thought passed.

I'm relatively straight, although I also find men attractive and would probably have sex with one. The reason I'm saying this was yesterday on the bus I saw a good looking girl. I thought 'I want to have sex with that girl'. But I also felt an intense jealously of her. Her clothes, her body language, the way she was acting - I wanted to be that.

I'm only 21, but I'm also beginning to feel panicky that time is running out for me to enjoy my youth as a feminine being.
Has anybody else felt this way? The thing is, I don't 100 per cent hate being a man. I've had plenty of fulfilling relationships with women as a man, and I've enjoyed presenting to the world as a man. I don't know if this is just me covering up.

I suspect I might fall somewhere under genderfluid, and for the first time in my life I'm being open to any femininity I might have. My issue is that I want to be two different things at once. How can I shave my body, lose muscle fat, wear female clothes and generally adopt more feminine traits, whilst at the same time also wanting to be masculine, muscular, bearded and so on. My personal preference is that I wouldn't feel comfortable incorporating the same two at the same time e.g. choosing to keep my body hair whilst also wearing make up. That's fine if anybody wants to be that way! But its not how I see my gender, I see it more as being one or the other. I'm just not sure which.
