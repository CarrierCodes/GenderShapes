In my initial intake appointment I was a bit uncomfortable with the provider, a nurse practitioner who happens to be a transwoman. I couldn't quite figure out why I was uncomfortable, just that I felt like I was under a microscope and it made me nervous.

My MtF husband (goes by he/him) also had the same second appointment, and while we had separate interviews last time, this time we sat in together on each other's appointments. I'm glad we did, because it made clear to *both of us* that this provider is NOT comfortable with non-binary trans presentations.

She was completely professional, but when interviewing me she was subtly aggressive and quite negative about my ""reasons"" for wanting T. She was very ""concerned"" about my conflicts and wanting to retain my feminine side (I told her of course I have conflicts, I'm non-binary.) She put me on the defensive, defending my reasons and understanding of the medical process and the permanent changes, etc, way beyond just ""informed consent"" issues. 

She was completely dismissive of my questions (which came from serious research) and when I asked about the possibility of a bit of estrogen to feed my female side she nearly freaked and never explained anything.  I asked also about vaginal atrophy, and she offered an estrogen ring. I explained that the research shows the cream is more effective, and she shrugged and said ""I wouldn't know"" in a still professional but almost snarky tone.

When she turned to my husband her entire body language and attitude changed, along the lines of, ""I'm here to take care of you and what can I do for you."" There were zero questions of why he would want HRT and didn't mention ANYTHING about informed consent issues. 

But then she dismissed questions/concerns of libido and loss of penile use, especially regarding spiro and wanting progesterone to help with function, she dismissed progesterone saying ""I don't prescribe progesterone. In my experience it causes depression."" Never mind it's a standard prescription for MtFs in the Standards of Care.

When he mentioned he wants an orchiectomy, she immediately launched into a spiel about how he didn't need one to get rid of his testes to get rid of testosterone because ""this is how HRT works"" and went into a spiel about the mechanism. I had to prod him to explain that his want for an orchi was because his testicles very existance is his primary physical dysphoria. Once she finally let him speak she changed to ""oh, I can give you a referral for that."" When I spoke up (I kept my mouth shut for most of it, my silence may have been a record for me) to say we were hoping for preservation of function, her response was ""there are other ways to have sex."" Completely dismissing our desire as a couple to continue having PIV sex. 

Which set me off and I went full snark on her and came very close to telling her off. She insisted that I would change my mind about preferring PIV sex (to me everything else is just foreplay) and that I had to learn new ways of enjoying sex. Oh, bullshit. She doesn't know me, and I'm no 20 year old kid just discovering his/her/their sexual self. I'm a 48 year old adult who has been married to my husband for 28 years. We have had long, long talks about this, both just with us and with our therapist, and came to agreements on how we would manage this.

And this ""provider"" did her best to throw out the window everything we worked together to keep our marriage intact and satisfying.

There was more, and now my husband doesn't want to be fully forthcoming with her, such as the fact that he self-medicated (DIY HRT) using birth control pills for four months (he fessed up to two weeks of it) and had NO problems with progesterone regarding depression (he felt better than ever) and now we're talking self-medication again, a bit of DIY progesterone for him, a bit of DIY estrogen for me.

2,2017-06-03 01:33:48,6eykxs,4,8,"Hey all,

Posted this to r/lgbt and someone there suggested I might get better responses and insight here. Feel free to let me know if there is a more appropriate space in another subreddit for this discussion. :) tl;dr at the bottom.

I've recently begun exploring my gender identity and I'm not too sure where I stand or am uber familiar with gender discourse and terminology, but here are some details about me:

* I am gay/am attracted to masculinity
* AMAB and do not feel enough discomfort with my assigned sex to the point where I'm seriously considering transitioning
* I feel neither exclusively male nor exclusively female in gender
* I don't fully subscribe to either of the traditional male or female gender roles
* I mostly dress in male clothes, have a beard, and short hair
* My natural inclination is to act in a feminine manner
* I tend to associate more/feel more comfortable socializing with those who are neither super feminine nor super masculine

I go to a dance studio and take classes that are very femme in style; e.g., femme hip hop/jazz funk, waacking, vogue, heels. Recently, I started taking a heels class where the instructor is a cisfemale and I'm feeling excluded/like the odd person out. Most of her students are also cisfemale and I am one of the few ""males"" there.

I'm not sure if she does them consciously or subconsciously, but the instructor says/does things that seem to favor cisfemales and come off as microaggressions to me. For example, in one class where I was the only one who wasn't cisfemale, she praised the ladies for doing a good job, but then said ""Oh and gentleman, too."" I'd actually feel much more comfortable and included if she had just left it at ""Great job ladies"" than her singling me out. In fact, when dance instructors separate students to perform in groups based on their gender, I often (half-jokingly) say ""I'm a lady"" because I don't quite feel like a ""man"".

She also has parts of the choreography where she has us whip our hair, but then tells the guys: ""For you men, you can do this instead."" I do have short hair, so I guess this is somewhat understandable.

I also notice that she directs her attention and individual praises toward the cisfemales. It somewhat feels like she is affirming cisfemale gender performance and doesn't quite know what to think of my femme non-cis style.

I suppose what I need help with is unpacking my reactions to her actions/words. Is this just insecurity talking? Has anyone ever felt excluded in female-centric spaces where ""female"" seems to mean female in physical sexual characteristics, gender identity, and gender presentation?

I'm also trying to fit my thoughts into a context of feminism and female empowerment. I understand that as an AMAB, I am unable to quite identify with the experiences that these women share together, but I don't think that should preclude me from feeling empowered in female-centric spaces. I fully embrace being femme and feeling sexy and powerful in a feminine manner in my dance classes, but I can't help but feel boxed out of these identities and boxed into being male in situations like those above.

Would truly appreciate any thoughts y'all have. Thanks so much.

**tl;dr I am a gay non-binary/genderqueer person who presents as mostly male on the outside but is really into feeling/being femme.

When I hang out with other girls, I don't have a problem of thinking of ourselves as being the same. However, I feel weird when men view me as different. 

I spoke a lot about how I others see me, but not about how I see me. When I think of myself, I do think of being just a person and not defined by a gender.

I don't dress up in a very feminine way (I know that how you dress up doesn't affect your gender identity) and I hate skirts as they are impractical. However, I do enjoy makeup, as it is very fun.

I considered myself genderfluid for a short time, but I didn't feel that my gender really changed.

38,2017-06-13 21:17:30,6h2y15,10,13,"I've been thinking a lot about cultural gender associations. I see transfeminine types wanting long hair and smooth skin, and transmasculine types wanting hairy bodies and beards and short hair. And maybe it's just the way I grew up, or the way I look at life, and I'm perplexed.

Maybe it's just the micro-culture I grew up in (San Francisco Bay Area), but I've never seen these as *gendered* associations.

I see hairy bodies not as a male trait, but as a hippy thing. Granola moms. Back to nature types. People I associate with either not wearing a bra or using natural organic deodorant (and never antiperspirant). And Birkenstocks. My mom is the hairiest person I know (she formed my idea of hairy as a hippy trait), except for my younger son, whom I think is part gorilla.

 When I look at pictures of hot guys in magazines, stuff like that, they're either clean shaven or, often, straight up waxed. They're never hairy. Do you see body hair on The Rock? Arnold Schwarzenegger? Any shirtless guy on a romance novel? Hairy men tend to be associated culturally with low intelligence and ""cave man"" (regressive) attitudes, or at least that's how I interpret the cultural message I see. So why is hairy a sought-out masculine trait among transmasculine folk?

Long hair is similar. I don't see long hair as a masculine or feminine trait. I see the style in which it is worn or cut as masculine or feminine. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), anyone? Maui (from Moana)? Any Viking warrior type? How about Jamie on Outlander? Where's the femininity? And again, look at romance novels. The guys' hair is often as long and flowing as the women on the cover.

Similarly, short hair. I often see it as an ""older woman's cut"" or a young woman's edgy cut if they have the bone structure to pull it off. It can be the sexiest feminine thing on the right woman. 

Moving on to skirts. Kilts. Sexiest, manliest thing on Earth. What is the difference between a kilt and a skirt? Not much, except for a bit of styling. All they did was give it a different name and suddenly no one has a problem accepting it as a masculine fashion.

40,2017-06-14 20:09:06,6ha346,3,6,"Hey everybody! So, I was born a guy, and I've been suffering from gender dysphoria for a while now, but I feel most comfortable identifying as a demiboy.

I came out to my best friend a while ago, and she wasn't supportive at all. I told her I have gender dysphoria. I've been stuck in this toxic relationship for a year and a half, and I am considering leaving her.

She's hurt me countless times. In the past, she has:

-lied to me multiple times, getting me in uncomfortable situations.

-blackmailed me into doing things for her that I didn't want to do. 

-cut off all communication with me after asking for a huge favor, and only talking to me when she needed another favor done.

-isolated me from all my friends so I would only have her.

-made herself look like a victim and almost having a huge dude break my neck.

-made false claims that I was stalking her, and threatened to put a restraining order on me.

-called me her puppy.

-left me stranded with no ride home.

I did everything for this girl, and when I asked for something in return, she abandoned me. But I loved her. I couldn't leave her. I'm not sure if I can even leave her now. I still love her. She's my best friend.

I've made a new friend a few weeks ago. They're genderfluid. Since I met them, only now I'm starting to realize what a horrible ""best friend"" I have. She isolated me from all my other friends over a year ago, so I had nothing to compare to. But my new friend? They're awesome. I had forgotten what it felt like having a real friend.

But, as you can imagine, the effects of the toxic relationship I'm in, combined with previous events from *before* I even met her, has left me with some very bad trust issues.

I'm hesitant to tell my new genderfluid friend about my gender dysphoria. I don't know why. Although my gender dysphoria is mostly gone, and I identify as a demiboy, there's still feminine things I want to do, such as try on girl clothes. My ""best friend"" promised we would try on girl clothes together, when she had changed her mind about my gender dysphoria and said she'd help me. Of course, this was a lie, and she only said this to shut me up. 

I realized not too long ago that I don't want to be a girl. I just didn't want to be a boy. Not completely, at least. That's why I identify as demiboy. Partially male, and partially genderless.

I want to tell my new friend that I'm a demiboy. I know they'll accept me, but I'm still scared. It sounds silly, but I'm worried that this person will just stab me in the back.

41,2017-06-14 21:01:55,6hafck,6,13,"I've been talking to my counselor and doctor a lot about the idea of taking testosterone, but I'm scared to actually make the jump. I'm a 25 year old AFAB person and I've dealt with gender dysphoria since I was a kid, and it has been particularly bad since I hit puberty at ten. It's so severe sometimes that I dissociate or have panic attacks. I even identified as a binary trans male on and off, mostly on, through 12 to 21, with phantom penis and everything. Working through a lot of internalized misogyny and having a few toxic relationships with dudes has landed me more in the nonbinary range. Some of that's because I experience gender pretty fluidly and most of the time I no longer identify strongly with either end of the binary, and some of it is probably because I've developed a fear of men - I'm working through that as best I can, but being seen as one is quite likely if I stay on T for the long haul. Sometimes I feel positively about it, other times negatively. I'm afraid of being seen as predatory, dirty, broken, ugly, and unlovable (which, as someone who presents as a butch lesbian currently, would be nothing new). I'm afraid of social rejection from both heternormative society and the LGBTQIA+ community. I'm afraid of facing violence for being trans, I'm afraid of losing housing and job opportunities for being trans, and I'm afraid of the cost of transition, because I'm a broke ass motherfucker and I'm pretty sure Medicaid wouldn't cover this.

I do relate a lot to womanhood at least in the sense that I was socialized into it, and it's colored pretty much all of my lived experiences so far. Sometimes I don't even mind my body as it is. I still pick apart what I don't like and wonder to what extent I'll be able to change it with exercise (although it's worth noting that no amount of restrictive eating and exercise have alleviated my dysphoria in the past), but I don't mind being read as small, soft, and feminine. I would still be seen that way on T too, I'm sure, but I'm afraid to lose that view of myself. I'm afraid of seeming predatory if I go into spaces and communities meant for women. I'm afraid I won't be able to talk about my alignment with womanhood anymore. I'm even a little afraid of no longer identifying with it. I feel like I've finally reclaimed my relationship to womanhood and femininity after having a very difficult relationship with it, so the thought of losing that makes me sad, even though rationally I know there's more than one way to practice those things. However, I also want to re-address my relationship with masculinity, because I practiced it poorly in the past and it's been dealt a lot of damage too, and I feel like T would give me a good avenue to do so.

This is all so confusing and frustrating and I find myself wishing I could just ""pick one."" I've identified as everything under the sun.. trans, butch, nonbinary, whatever. I don't really know the right words for me anymore - hell, maybe it's a little of all - I just know I have this dysphoria and fluidity, I have always struggled with them, and they're all-consuming lately. And that I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself whiplash, constantly trying to talk myself out of it. I get so close to begging my therapist for a letter to start T, walk myself off that ledge, and then repeat on a weekly basis. It's kind of messing with my ability to function.

Sometimes I think I should stick with the cis-presenting butch thing  a while longer and just try to alter my body through working out, or that I should just try to practice radical body acceptance more. Other times I think I should just bite the bullet and try low-dose T because it seems like this obsession will never wane if I don't.

Throwaway 'cause some people I know are on reddit.


I've pretty much given up on telling my friends and teachers and everyone else I'm forced to interact with. My friends tell me that's nice, and and go back to calling me the wrong stuff, my classmates mostly tell me I don't exist and actively go against my wishes on pronouns and the like, my teachers often outright ignore me, and it's easier to check F than to get into a fight with the person behind the counter at the DMV, because, no, I didn't forget to chose, I'm just not either.



My family also isn't the safest to come out to. My father is homophobic and thinks trans people are just ""so gay they think they're women."" or bitter feminists who are too ugly to get men. My mother, while slightly more excepting in a, ""I'm happy for *those* people,"" sorta way, would probably just accuse me of wanting to be different (because there's nothing I want more than to want to tear off my face because clearly it's not mine—not me) and act as if I'm placing a huge burden on her because I want her to use the correct pronouns or not call me her fucking daughter.


I'm pretty sure my mother won't kick me out if I came out, but I can't be sure on my father, and it's a solid 4 years until I'm (hopefully) able move out for college, so if I value having shelter, I can't tell them. Due to my inability to say who I am, as far as my parents are concerned, I'm just a tomboy, and, try as I might, I can't twist it into a praise of my acting skills, that they see me as the real thing instead of a painfully bad actor stuck playing a role they got sick of years ago. The worst part is, I was raised with a more amab view on crying; that it was weak, and nothing more than a character flaw, and because I can't just stop feeling sad, I just twist it into anger. So every time they misgender me it feels like being stabbed only to feel nothing but pure rage, which really puts a strain on our relationship. The other day my mother went into a rant that revolved around the ""fact"" that I was a girl, and I don't think I've ever hated someone more than I did in that moment. (I'm still not sure if I hated her, for not letting up for what felt like an eternity, or myself, for not being able to live up to what everyone clearly thought should be a basic fact of my existence.) I don't want to feel this way. I want to be close to the people I care about, but I can't ignore this underlying feeling of resentment.

Throughout my life, I've always been seen as rock-solid heterosexual male even though I'm not the least bit the macho kind of person. To quote a gay friend (who doesn't actually know about all this), I'm the kind of person who he would guess ""has a wife waiting at home"" right at first sight. Not sure why that is but the sentiment is almost universal.

However, I've always harbored a mild interest in female fashion while I myself used to dress poorly - and now only passably decent - as a guy because I just couldn't be bothered with boring male clothes. The curiosity built and built until 2014, when I stumbled upon a community of crossdressers on Facebook. Later that same year, I ended up meeting a member of the group who was a serious expert at MtF makeup jobs.

[This](https://imgur.com/quRIuu3) was the result. In the space of a minute (she wanted me to just see the final result instead of gradual change), my mind basically crashed and I went from ""ha, I'll never even look slightly feminine"" to ""now that's a version of myself that I can be proud of"".

Afterwards, she told me there was a small but visible shift in my demeanor while dressed. This sent me into a tailspin of confusion. What am I? Why do I have a female side if I still liked women and only women? Is it some kind of kink?

The only clear answer I could come up for myself at the time was for that last question. Sexual gratification wasn't even on my mind that day. It was just pure *joy*. It felt right without making my male self feel wrong.

Then I just had to let it out. I had a girlfriend and I didn't want her to misunderstand. Parents were right out since I didn't want them to deal with anything this complicated - at least not before I figured myself out. I ended up telling a female friend after much dillying and dallying.

Her first response was that I should try a different hair color next time. A wave of relief crashed into me. At the very least, I have this tiny safe space for myself.

Not long after, I ended up leaving my job for a year as a freelancer. This meant a lot of staying at home and little to no safe private time or space. The freelance year did wonders for my financial and career prospects, but my girl side was simply locked in a box, half forgotten.

A year after I first told my friend, I admitted to her that I was still feeling a kind of twinge every time I see a well-dressed woman - one part generic admiration and one part jealousy that I can't go for the same look. This was about a month before my wedding.

We talked and talked. We reached an agreement. She would help ""set me free"" for a day as a girl so I have a shot at knowing for certain what I really feel. This would be the whole shebang - full-body waxing and dresses and going outside.

That was January 9, 2017. It was the single happiest day of my life. It was actually petrifying at first - letting a friend see you as... something different for the first time, stepping outside in a dress for the first time, the works - until I went into a women's restroom and *nobody batted an eye*.

Since then, I've rented an apartment close to my house as a kind of vault for my girl stuff. That closet is filling up at a pretty good pace. My marriage is still in fine shape. I'm still attracted only to women.

At the very least, I have this tiny safe space for myself.\n\nNot long after, I ended up leaving my job for a year as a freelancer. This meant a lot of staying at home and little to no safe private time or space. The freelance year did wonders for my financial and career prospects, but my girl side was simply locked in a box, half forgotten.\n\nA year after I first told my friend, I admitted to her that I was still feeling a kind of twinge every time I see a well-dressed woman - one part generic admiration and one part jealousy that I can\'t go for the same look. This was about a month before my wedding.\n\nWe talked and talked. We reached an agreement. She would help ""set me free"" for a day as a girl so I have a shot at knowing for certain what I really feel. This would be the whole shebang - full-body waxing and dresses and going outside.\n\nThat was January 9, 2017. It was the single happiest day of my life. It was actually petrifying at first - letting a friend see you as... something different for the first time, stepping outside in a dress for the first time, the works - until I went into a women\'s restroom and *nobody batted an eye*.\n\nSince then, I\'ve rented an apartment close to my house as a kind of vault for my girl stuff. That closet is filling up at a pretty good pace. My marriage is still in fine shape. I\'m still attracted only to women.\n\nSo... that\'s my story. Sorry if it was overly long and rambling at times.

I'm nonbinary - specifically, agender with pretty-boy leanings.
This may get to be a long story, but I guess I have some things to get off of my chest, and I hope this is an appropriate place to do it, as I'm sure some of you have had similar experiences.  (I hope not, but it's unfortunately common.)

TL;DR: I dated a shitty chaser a few years back, they randomly reappeared recently, set me down a gripping anxiety spiral that I can't seem to fully escape.
content warning: sex, boundary issues / bad consent, chasers, slurs

Okay, so let's hop into the time machine and head back a few years to the time I met a strange human at a bar.  We're gonna call this person Socks, because their real name is equally odd (and they'd definitely find this thread, which could prove to be a shitstorm.)
Socks is an odd character.  I was at a bar doing karaoke and this person came and talked to me and my at-the-time boyfriend...at least, I think that's how it went down.  I actually don't have a very vivid memory of that night, but I do vaguely remember taking some pictures of Socks making weird faces, which still pop up on Facebook every year on that ""On This Day"" page, haha.
From that point forward, Socks and I were occasional friends.  Maybe once a year we would hang out, smoke, talk about weird shit.  Things were good that way.

But let's fast forward to 2015.  2015 was a shitty year, and I was drinking more than I should, partly because I was cheated on and broken up with on my birthday and that led me to self-medicate my depression (horribly ineffectively, I might add).  I was having one such shitty day when I made a Facebook status like,
""Hey, I wanna hang out with people but I don't want to leave my house.  Someone come over plz.""
Socks jumped on the opportunity and headed over.  We hung out, but things were different this time.  We ended up making out and things escalated from that point, and soon we were in a relationship.

Some background info on Socks: they identify as a trans woman / genderfluid.  I'm going to be using they pronouns for Socks throughout the story, although they also used she.

Maybe it's because I was high pretty much every time we hung out for the first few months, but I missed (or willingly ignored) A LOT of red flags.  Socks's chaserness was insidious.  I guess it's worth mentioning here that, at the time, I was identifying as a trans man (but getting less and less binary as time wore on).  Socks had a whole folder full of art of naked trans men saved to their phone, which they showed me.  I was more than mildly skeeved out by that - I guess it's also worth mentioning that I'm demisexual and ergo really not into porn at all.  But it gets worse.  
Whenever we were doing sexual things, they would call me names like c*ntboy, tr*nny, f*ggot...I would tell them not to, they would apologize...and do the same thing next time.  It was their attempt at ~sexily humiliating~ me, which I thought I was into, but not like that.  (I've actually realized that I'm one of the most vanilla people I know...Socks literally fetishized everything, to an absurd extent.)  Just thinking about it is making my anxiety ramp up rn.  I think that's why I need to keep writing.

In addition to using shitty slurs toward me, despite my repeated attempts to get them not to, Socks would also straight-up insult me.  Socks derogatorily called me fat all the time (I'm thick, nothing wrong with it, and if you weren't attracted to me, why are we banging anyway?) and told me that I should work out, get more muscular.  They would tell me they wished I were more manly, more aggressive.  They would try to pressure me into starting T (at this point, I had decided I didn't want to medically transition, although previously I had been considering it), telling me over and over again how hot I would be if I were manlier, etc.  If anything, all this pressure just served to further convince me that none of this was what I wanted at all.  But Socks couldn't take no for an answer, and kept trying to pressure me to be someone I wasn't.  It was creepy as shit.

Down the road, we broke it off because Socks wanted to be poly and I had explicitly stated that I am not poly, yes I've given it a shot before, no I don't ever want to try it again.  They said this was stifling them.  Fine.  Be free.  We honestly were together way longer than we should have been.  I mean, besides all the shittiness, we also had very dissimilar life goals (they wanted to have kids, I didn't, etc.) and honestly didn't get along if we weren't completely obliterated (like I said, I've drastically cut down on all substances since then.)

A few months later, I'm hanging out with my friend...let's call him Shoes.  Shoes and I go way back, and we have a lot of mutual friends, including Socks and this really cool trans woman who we're gonna call Sleeves. (I'm so creative, I know.)  
Shoes and I are talking late at night and somehow the conversation turns to Socks.  Shoes mentions that Socks has made some really creepy advances on Sleeves, i.e. telling her that she ""needs to let [Socks] try on her panties because [Socks] thinks that's hot"".  Socks also made advances on Sleeves right after we broke up, which Sleeves told me about because it made her uncomfortable.

In that moment, I realized...fuck, Socks is really predatory.  Socks is a chaser.  Socks has a fetish for trans people.  And from that point on, I wasn't sure if Socks is really trans or is just taking their fetish too far.  A harsh judgement?  For sure.  But it's possible, and there's no way to know for certain, I guess.

Anyway, let's skip to the present day.  Recently Socks texted me, after not having talked to me for months (we did still have mutual friends and had been invited to the same parties, so we would be civil for the occasion) about ""returning"" some item they had given to me during our relationship.  I told them that, no, I would be keeping it.  They then proceeded to basically accuse me of stealing.  This was all weirdly traumatic for me and caused me to have a panic attack, and I blocked them everywhere and told them to not talk to me again.  I actually wrote a call-out post for them, which, hopefully I'll never have to share that with our mutual friends, but at least I'm prepared if they want to try and start shit again.

Since then, I haven't been quite the same.  I think it was the randomness of the event, and the extremeness of the accusations, and the fact that they were reminding me of their shitty presence all at once, but I have a lot of anxiety since the text conversation.  And since I can't afford to see a therapist, I hoped writing it out would help.  So I guess that's why I'm making this post.

Has anyone experienced something similar?  Want to talk through it with me?  It would be greatly appreciated.

Or, you know, correct me - ideally, that.)\nI\'m nonbinary - specifically, agender with pretty-boy leanings.\nThis may get to be a long story, but I guess I have some things to get off of my chest, and I hope this is an appropriate place to do it, as I\'m sure some of you have had similar experiences.  (I hope not, but it\'s unfortunately common.)\n\nTL;DR: I dated a shitty chaser a few years back, they randomly reappeared recently, set me down a gripping anxiety spiral that I can\'t seem to fully escape.\ncontent warning: sex, boundary issues / bad consent, chasers, slurs\n\nOkay, so let\'s hop into the time machine and head back a few years to the time I met a strange human at a bar.  We\'re gonna call this person Socks, because their real name is equally odd (and they\'d definitely find this thread, which could prove to be a shitstorm.)\nSocks is an odd character.  I was at a bar doing karaoke and this person came and talked to me and my at-the-time boyfriend...at least, I think that\'s how it went down.  I actually don\'t have a very vivid memory of that night, but I do vaguely remember taking some pictures of Socks making weird faces, which still pop up on Facebook every year on that ""On This Day"" page, haha.\nFrom that point forward, Socks and I were occasional friends.  Maybe once a year we would hang out, smoke, talk about weird shit.  Things were good that way.\n\nBut let\'s fast forward to 2015.  2015 was a shitty year, and I was drinking more than I should, partly because I was cheated on and broken up with on my birthday and that led me to self-medicate my depression (horribly ineffectively, I might add).  I was having one such shitty day when I made a Facebook status like,\n""Hey, I wanna hang out with people but I don\'t want to leave my house.  Someone come over plz.""\nSocks jumped on the opportunity and headed over.  We hung out, but things were different this time.  We ended up making out and things escalated from that point, and soon we were in a relationship.\n\nSome background info on Socks: they identify as a trans woman / genderfluid.  I\'m going to be using they pronouns for Socks throughout the story, although they also used she.\n\nMaybe it\'s because I was high pretty much every time we hung out for the first few months, but I missed (or willingly ignored) A LOT of red flags.  Socks\'s chaserness was insidious.  I guess it\'s worth mentioning here that, at the time, I was identifying as a trans man (but getting less and less binary as time wore on).  Socks had a whole folder full of art of naked trans men saved to their phone, which they showed me.  I was more than mildly skeeved out by that - I guess it\'s also worth mentioning that I\'m demisexual and ergo really not into porn at all.  But it gets worse.  \nWhenever we were doing sexual things, they would call me names like c*ntboy, tr*nny, f*ggot...I would tell them not to, they would apologize...and do the same thing next time.  It was their attempt at ~sexily humiliating~ me, which I thought I was into, but not like that.  (I\'ve actually realized that I\'m one of the most vanilla people I know...Socks literally fetishized everything, to an absurd extent.)  Just thinking about it is making my anxiety ramp up rn.  I think that\'s why I need to keep writing.\n\nIn addition to using shitty slurs toward me, despite my repeated attempts to get them not to, Socks would also straight-up insult me.  Socks derogatorily called me fat all the time (I\'m thick, nothing wrong with it, and if you weren\'t attracted to me, why are we banging anyway?) and told me that I should work out, get more muscular.  They would tell me they wished I were more manly, more aggressive.  They would try to pressure me into starting T (at this point, I had decided I didn\'t want to medically transition, although previously I had been considering it), telling me over and over again how hot I would be if I were manlier, etc.  If anything, all this pressure just served to further convince me that none of this was what I wanted at all.  But Socks couldn\'t take no for an answer, and kept trying to pressure me to be someone I wasn\'t.  It was creepy as shit.\n\nDown the road, we broke it off because Socks wanted to be poly and I had explicitly stated that I am not poly, yes I\'ve given it a shot before, no I don\'t ever want to try it again.  They said this was stifling them.  Fine.  Be free.  We honestly were together way longer than we should have been.  I mean, besides all the shittiness, we also had very dissimilar life goals (they wanted to have kids, I didn\'t, etc.) and honestly didn\'t get along if we weren\'t completely obliterated (like I said, I\'ve drastically cut down on all substances since then.)\n\nA few months later, I\'m hanging out with my friend...let\'s call him Shoes.  Shoes and I go way back, and we have a lot of mutual friends, including Socks and this really cool trans woman who we\'re gonna call Sleeves. (I\'m so creative, I know.)  \nShoes and I are talking late at night and somehow the conversation turns to Socks.  Shoes mentions that Socks has made some really creepy advances on Sleeves, i.e. telling her that she ""needs to let [Socks] try on her panties because [Socks] thinks that\'s hot"".  Socks also made advances on Sleeves right after we broke up, which Sleeves told me about because it made her uncomfortable.\n\nIn that moment, I realized...fuck, Socks is really predatory.  Socks is a chaser.  Socks has a fetish for trans people.  And from that point on, I wasn\'t sure if Socks is really trans or is just taking their fetish too far.  A harsh judgement?  For sure.  But it\'s possible, and there\'s no way to know for certain, I guess.\n\nAnyway, let\'s skip to the present day.  Recently Socks texted me, after not having talked to me for months (we did still have mutual friends and had been invited to the same parties, so we would be civil for the occasion) about ""returning"" some item they had given to me during our relationship.  I told them that, no, I would be keeping it.  They then proceeded to basically accuse me of stealing.  This was all weirdly traumatic for me and caused me to have a panic attack, and I blocked them everywhere and told them to not talk to me again.  I actually wrote a call-out post for them, which, hopefully I\'ll never have to share that with our mutual friends, but at least I\'m prepared if they want to try and start shit again.\n\nSince then, I haven\'t been quite the same.  I think it was the randomness of the event, and the extremeness of the accusations, and the fact that they were reminding me of their shitty presence all at once, but I have a lot of anxiety since the text conversation.  And since I can\'t afford to see a therapist, I hoped writing it out would help.  So I guess that\'s why I\'m making this post.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?  Want to talk through it with me?  It would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading this, and I hope you have a great day.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'When a chaser from the past randomly reappears and ruins your month.', 'created': 1498182937.0}"

I was wondering how this works and figured it's best to ask those who might also be both non-binary and gay.  

I have the standard, I guess you could call it, teaching of gender and sexuality. Basically what I was taught in school: there are two genders and homosexuality is a form of sexuality and I'm trying to understand gender as we have come to understand it recently as my learning is now outdated. 

So here's my question: 

To be gay you have to have sexual feelings for the same sex as yourself so how can you be non-binary and gay. Surely, if you understand that you are gay then you have automatically declared yourself to be either male or female because you are admitting you have feelings for the same sex as yourself.

I feel that I can't cope with myself since long time ago and I'm just 19 soon-to-be 20. Sorry if I sound dramatic. Right now I think I have three ""big"" choices in my life.

1) Keep going like I am without changing nothing, hating myself, wanting to not be me and wishing to never have existed in the first place. But, having the support of my family, ""friends"" and girlfriend.

2) Try to transition, starting with HRT, working to have money for a FFS and so on. This way I will lose my family (they are anti-LGBT+ to the point of cheering when they read they are beating/killed. They hate them deeply), ""friends"" and lose my girlfriend (even though she says we could still be friends). Added to this I could:
* still feel deeply dissatisfied with myself and feel like a monster but now alone and hated not just by me. 
*  Feel good with myself but still lonely and I haven't graduated from college. Where I'm from there's a high index of unemployment for people under 25 (40%) so I fear not getting a proper job and because my family would now hate me, live homeless.


3) an option that comes to my mind more and more, so seducing and could happen now or after taking path 1) or 2). Ending my life, I see no hope ahead, every road is darkened and awful, There's no light no hope in my future and I dont want to sound dramatic but I wish I have never been in the first place.

I don't want to sadden my family... But I just feel so devastated and hopeless... It seems so seducing the option of finishing it all as I see no good road ahead of me. Sorry if I sound dramatic.

Every second that ticks without me doing something, it means I'm taking path 1) and the hormones of my body are doing its disgusting effects on me that I just hate (only in me, I have nothing wrong with other people, I don't hate anybody else).

We got married 2 weeks or so after I got back. (for some background we've known each other/been together for 10 years, living together for just over 4).

Hes okay with me packing, binding, we're even talking about top surgery. But he's straight. And now I'm having a mojito crisis. Did I make the right decision to get married? I don't doubt at all that we're soulmates. But what if I do want t in the future? I didn't think I would, and I don't see myself really wanting it for years, if ever. 

But am I ever going to be my true self? And who IS my true self? When I was still questioning, I felt a ""girl"" side of me and a ""guy"" side of me. But lately I've realized I don't feel that ""girl"" side of me anymore. 

I know for a fact that I want top surgery. After that, is my other dysphoria just going to get worse? 

Can love really be stronger then something like this? So far it seems like it. He's okay with so much.. Maybe after some time he'd be okay with more?

Hi. So, um, I've always felt like a boy. The feelings are stronger than ever now, so I did some research. So I'm transgender. I think I already knew this, since I heard about the kids who were transgender. Anyway, I want to be a boy. I want to cut my hair short before the dance. I want to wear what a boy would wear in the 50s to the dance. I don't want to wear frilly girly clothes. You can't force me to wear that, especially now. I'll still get stuff from the girl section but not the girly pink frilly stuff. I want to be called E*. I'm to go by he/him instead of she/her. I want to be your son. I am 100% sure. I really hope you support and respect me. Also, I'm bi, so I like boys and girls, but that doesn't have really anything to do with my being trans. I'm still gonna be me. 

*I've omitted his chosen name for privacy reasons. 

We got his hair cut and got him a cool greaser style outfit for the dance which was on Friday. The refusal to wear girly clothes isn't really anything new, for the most part I've let him have a hand in picking out the clothes I buy for him to wear (his mother and I are divorced so I don't know what she buys for him) and he's never really liked dresses. The only time I've made him wear a dress was for weddings and funerals which there have only been 2 of the former recently and thankfully only one of the latter. 

His mother and I have looked into and are signing him up for group sessions with other transgender kids his age (they run a concurrent group for the parents while the kids are in session). Meanwhile his mother and I are both updating our respective families (this is by his request, I think talking to us was the extent of his bravery for now). We also spoke with his teacher to let her know in case anything happens/comes up in the last couple weeks of school. 

So I'm posting now to ask, what else should I be doing?  Those of you who have told your parents/families, what things did they do that were great? Or what things did they do that were not so great and I should avoid?

Hi there. I'm glad I found this subreddit and so happy to see there are many others like me. Many others who are very confused and lost, and I am that without a doubt.

I'm 26 and was born a male. I never had much thought about being male, I mostly maintained a position of neutrality towards my gender and genitalia. Assuming the normal role as a male in society wasn't something I chose but instead it just happened. Did it make me unhappy? No, not necessarily, but I was absolutely sure that it didn't make me happy.

My sexuality has always been mysterious even to myself. I can firmly say I'm attracted to any human regardless of their identity, gender, role, or genitalia. I like both female and male sex organs. As an easy escape from explanation I just say I am bisexual or pansexual depending on the context, and it seems to cover everything....except not.

I have struggled immensely with whether or not I am transgender. On one hand, being a male for the rest of my life seems....acceptable. Doable. Less complicated. On the other hand, I desire very greatly to identify as a girl and live my life as a girl. I feel dysphoric about my body but not my genitals. I don't hate my penis, I just much rather wish it was a vagina.

I have never felt a sense of inner sexiness from presenting as a male....however every time I wear panties I feel like sexiness exudes from me. I have not ever been able to fully dress as a girl, with makeup and wig and the whole nine yards. I do own some clothes mainly for crossdressing under my boy clothes, panties etc. However I think if I was able to make myself up and look somewhat passable, I would feel the happiest and most love for myself I have ever felt.

I felt at least some of these feelings before I ever found the 'sissy fetish', and I have always had a strange attraction to panties from a very young age. However after finding sissy training, porn, hypnos, etc. I began to think this was a more serious part of who I am and not just something that's fun to jerk off to, and I also began noticing issues with myself. I do not like when hypnos or training refers to me as a sissy, and especially not when they refer to me a 'faggot.' When I am in that state of mind, when it's sissy playtime, I am a girl. No doubt about it. I want to be called a girl, treated like one, and presented as one, not at all as a sissy male with a fetish.

Now why am I confused? Sounds like I'm transgender right? Except for whatever reason it's like I'm okay with just being a male. Even though everything screams from within that I want to be a girl, I want to be feminine. It's like there's a voice in my head who says 'that's silly, you're a boy and no one will ever accept you as anything else' and I just listen to it. I have purged two or three times and not always regretted it right away, and seem to have always come back to at least wearing my big girl panties again.

Sigh, I just don't know what to do. And no, I don't have a therapist and have not had the resources to reach out.

33,2017-06-16 03:47:27,6hk5hv,8,10,"Brace yourselves for a long one...I apologize. 😬👎

...I have been questioning my gender identity for my entire life. (But for the record, I am bio female in their 20s). 


I guess I can start off by kind of giving you an outlook. Okay lets say this; for most trans people....the carpet doesn't match the house...the carpet is pink but the house is blue. With me, the carpet is pink and the house is pink...but its like...two different shades of pink if that makes sense. Or I can even say the carpet is pink and the house is pink with blue all mixed in to make some weird bluish pinkish colour idk how to really explain it. But I can say I was always masculine. I played football with the boys in school and the rules would always be every girl was two-hand touch....except for me. I was tackle. 


My older brother would cross-dress me too. Would call me his ""baby bro"" and see if people would fall for it. Usually they did because I was so young &amp; nothing filled out yet. That or I was always dressed very androgynous when he was around. Thing is, I preferred that. I used to burn the skirts my mother would make me wear. I would cry in church because I had to wear those dresses. Getting older, I stole my Dad and my brothers clothes and wore them but I never hid it. I just went to school or played outside in them...I was always into just girls until 18 when I got into guys and masturbation and all that. So everyone just thought I was a butch...including me. But like I felt happy wearing the clothes. Thats all I can really say. 
To fast forward so this isnt really long, I thought I was ftm in high school. So I started passing and changed my pronouns among friends. It felt right, at first. But I still had moments where I felt like a full on girl. I had moments where I wanted to wear dresses and eyeliner. So I thought I was bigender....and that didn't feel right either after a while.


Now...I don't know. I started getting backlash from family and friends, so I just swallowed it all together and became the cisgendered girl I am today. Now that I am older and have been with both genders, I am sexually attracted to men but not romantically attracted to them...and vice versa with women...with women I was SO BORED but I am SO physically and romantically attracted..But I am a sexual being, and they lack the..plumbing..that I am attracted to. Part of me wonders if it has anything to do with it. 


I guess I am also questioning it so hard right now too because I found out my girlfriend is actually mtf, and being with her just...brings the dude out in me. I mean I stopped with any makeup, stopped shaving the..erm...""areas""...and last week, I experimented again. I put away all of the femme clothes I was making myself wear and bought new ones all from the mens section (even complete with boxer briefs) and I am much more comfortable. I have my days...I wore a dress(ish) to work once...But I wear dress shirts everyday...I told myself I wasn't going to tell her or anyone because of A) the backlash and B ) She goes through real shit being mtf, being on HRT, wanting SRS, and I feel like trying to talk to her about petty feelings when I don't even want to transition would invalidate her. I know its ridiculous. But its true. I feel like she's at 10 and I am at 1 so I am unimportant right now. But I was so happy and comfy I took pictures and she happened to see it. And she told me ""You wear whatever you want."" that was pretty much it. I am not sure if she would even support it, being that she is a lesbian.
Anywhore~ When I look into the mirror...I don't see a guy. I can't imagine a guy like I used to. But one day I was dating a guy who wished I was more ""feminine"" so this girl did my makeup and gave me an outfit...I cried infront of the mirror. I felt ugly and I hated who I was staring at. It wasn't me. And I hated that it is who everyone wants me to be because I know for sure I am not that person. I recently wore another fully male-oriented outfit to work. But instead of boying up completely I wore some small eyeliner with it and didn't try to hide my boobs so much...I loved it. It was perfect. I felt comfortable. I felt right mixing the male appearance with feminine attributes.
So if being a boy in most aspects is right...but I don't feel I am ftm or bigender...But I also don't feel like just a cisgendered girl....I don't know what I'd classify myself as. I guess I am more looking for a community than a label so that I can maybe find someone like me and ask more questions. Maybe even find someone to help me find the courage to come out to my girlfriend (sounds crazy right? Scared to come out to someone who is trans...that you might be trans).

41,2017-06-20 02:07:14,6ib3p1,2,1,"Hello all. I am wondering if I can get some advise and experiences from you regarding the first while after you transitioned. My step brother is 17 and has recently transitioned from female to male and I have no problem supporting them. I had many friends in high school go through the same thing and I was there for them in any way I could be and would like to be for my step brother as well. 

My only problem is they have always been an attention seeker. They were the divorce child and by that I mean the child who was spoiled and given everthing because they were so young when the divorce happened and then in the past 3 years it sort of wore off. People stopped paying as much attention to them and then all of a sudden they decide they are now a he. Still fine to me and his family. 

The problem continues in that he only hang out with trans friends now. Most of which are 3 years younger than him. And the only thing we ever hear about if being trans. Does not matter to who it where it when. The only conversation you can have with him is that he is trans and gay. Even if you just don't respond he keeps going on and on. He will change the topic of conversation to said topic. And heaven forbid you mess up and call him a she or by their original name. You will get a speech about how you don't support him and don't care about him. This also happens to his mother though who has been nothing but supportive. But has a degenerative brain disorder that effects their memory and speech sometimes.

I'm at the point I can't stand to be near them because all they talk about is how they are adding a new colour to this trans flag. And I want to die my hair the colour of the trans flag. And this one person out of 60 people called me a she so I need to get pins to state my prounoun. And on and on and on. It was never like this when my other friends went through it and I'm struggling. 

I guess overall I just want to know how I can support him without wanting to punch him. And also if anyone else was this pushy and how best to handle it. To me I think he does feel more comfortable as a boy. But where does it become raising awareness and just looking for attention.

Participant Recruitment Post

We are a research team from Texas Tech University, UCLA, and Harvard University, and we are conducting a study on minority stress, health, and access to/use of hormones for transition among trans people who are, or want to, use hormones as part of transitioning from female to male. We welcome all individuals to participate who would be included in the “female-to-male” umbrella and who are or are thinking of using hormones (e.g., testosterone) to transition, regardless of specific gender identity and whether or not individuals have or have not begun, or desire to, undertake any aspects of gender transitioning. 

We hope that this study will contribute to the understanding of health and well-being, and access to transitioning hormones, among trans individuals, and will help to promote future work including federally funded initiatives to benefit trans communities. 

Your participation is essential to achieving this goal, so we hope that you will take part in our online survey study. 

In order to participate, you must: 
• Be 18 years of age or older 
• Identify within the “female-to-male” umbrella. We include individuals who were assigned female at birth and are/or are thinking of undergoing transitioning processes. 
• Use, or be thinking of using, hormones are part of transitioning. 
• Reside in the United States

49,2017-06-21 19:20:01,6io3tn,2,11,"I had lunch with the owner of my company who is super duper amazingly supportive of my transition and wants me to be super comfortable continue to work at my company. Date for coming out to company scheduled for July 12 (logistical reasons).....

**Background:** My company is owned by a single person who is super duper amazingly supportive, but also a little clueless. He doesn't know any transgendered folks personally nor likely does anyone else in the company (despite living in NYC)

I don't know what folks internal response will be, but I also have 110% support from the owner and I suspect people will be accepting, thrilled, ambivalent, uncomfortable, confused, or any of the above.

**So.... now I get to write an FAQ.** I get direct control of the narrative, wording, and method of execution of how I come out. They've never had a trans employee, nonetheless someone coming out as trans.

&gt; *To me.... this is amazing, and I really don't want to fuck this up.*

I also understand it 'shouldn't' be me to do this, but now I have this amazing opportunity to really affect the lives of my coworker's perception. Most of my coworker likely don't know (or know they know) any trans folks and most view me positively (or at least competent) .... so as a whole I am super optimistic.... and nervous... and relieved..... and happy.... and excited.

**Plan: **

 * Write an FAQ to answer common questions, establish what questions are inappropriate, and establishing norms of treatment. This'll be the basis for the talk between owner and management.
 * Some personal conversations with direct manager &amp; team
 * Owner sends an email (with my own personal note and words) while I work from home. Small groups of people with direct managers to answer any additional questions / become more comfortable.
 * be all at work as me!  :D :) &lt;3
 * Client conversations happen after. (Something I said is not a good precedent), client conversations and internal coming out should be simultaneous.... But first times etc.
None of us have done this before. I'm sure there's a ""set way"", but to me this seems to make sense.

Im a 26 yo guy. I have been straight all ny life, but recently ive been feeling curious about experimenting.

I found this gorgeous tgirl on grindr. She is an escort but after chatting for a while she told me to go to her place for free.

I have to be honest, I chickened out and didnt go but today she told ld to go again.

Im not sure, my mind is confused. Im only interested in topping but also Im not sure about being BI. 

Let me explain, I dislike pennis. If I see a cock I lost my arousal and it turns me off completely. Also I have been isolated for a long time and unable to find a girl, and for some reason I feel Im only really horny and lonely and those are the reasons Im just looking for any kind osex I can find.

Also she lives close to my place, so Im pretty concerned about the repercussions of it. 


Any kind of advice would be helpful and appreciated

62,2017-06-25 03:59:49,6jcfac,1,7,"So I don't know how I feel about today.
I tried to figure out which trans subreddit was most ok with a rant, so I hope you lot don't mind. Sorry if you do.

I probably only came out to myself as trans about a year ago. But in college, I experimented with homosexuality and cross dressing. It was fun, and I had a boyfriend who was really into it. My brothers knew. And I never really tried to hide it, but every few years I realize my circle of friends are further and further removed from that part of my life, and I get worried about it coming up. It's like coming out of the closet again and again, only never quite really doing it.

As far as my circle of friends care I'm a cis-hetero male. And,  while I'm juggling complex feelings on the whole subject, I'm pretty ok with it. I work with kids too, and any sign of femininity would cause me loads of problems. So I've been outwardly pretty masculine for quite a while. Like, ten or eleven years since that college fling.


So I'm at a party tonight with some good friends (from later in my college career)  And in walks this guy, who keeps giving me the eye. Later I find he's a good friend of my college boyfriend. He was kind of a prick, but he's ok now, I guess. We talk a bit, and he starts talking about my ex, and how he (the ex) is transitioning now, and then suddenly shifts gears and congratulates me on doing well, and how I grew up and how I'm so manly now.

And I'm sitting here, a few tequila down, thinking ""Last time this guy saw me I was in a sundress with waist length hair practically passing. Most of our interactions involved me snogging his friend, or heading into another room to snog his friends junk. What the hell is this guy thinking.""


So it was just waves crashing over me for a while. Did I want him to stop acknowledging my masculinity? Was I afraid he was going to out me to my current friends, who both know and don't know? Do bi, closeted, or otherwise people who are currently ""Acting straight/cis"" ever get away from this constant feeling of being re-outed and re-explaining yourself to the same people?

And worse.... he said he was going to tell the ex how I was doing... do I even want contact with them? No. But maybe their courage with finally transitioning could help me? Or I could help them? Ugh, god... is it ok to just not care and leave exes as exes?

I guess part of the reason that I don't want to see a professional is that I'm afraid that they'll tell me that I'm not trans enough, or that I'm not trans at all and I've just been forcing myself to do this (for whatever reason) for all this time.

I've been thinking about getting voice surgery and/or tracheal shave but I'm running into some complications. The first one is that I'm not sure if I could ever pass (I've had people call me ma'am but I'm never really sure if they're just being polite), and I'm concerned that if I get voice surgery that if I decide that if this isn't for me that I'll never be able to live down what I've done to myself. I really am anxious to get it done as soon as possible because I feel like it's preventing me from passing, and it's slowly driving me insane because I'm almost full time and I just don't want to admit it to myself, and I feel like once I open my mouth everything falls apart. I was considering getting a shave done first, but that will delay the voice surgery and reduce the amount of adjustment they can make (Yeson strongly cautioned against having it done by anyone except Facial Team when I emailed them), and I've been told that my Adam's apple isn't that prominent by a few people including the surgeon during my consult. I have considered doing voice therapy, but I've tried doing some voice training on my own and even if I was successful I'd feel like my voice was fake, and the anxiety about slipping up would be too much for me.

I get extremely agoraphobic on the weekends. It's not as bad as it used to be, but even when I manage to drag myself out of the house I avoid people. I occasionally have thought to myself that dying would be far easier, but I wouldn't consider myself suicidal, because it's not something I see myself acting on, mainly because I'm a Christian. A really really bad one, but still...

I told him what I was looking for and he just gestured to the entire aisle, and I explained to him that what I was looking for wasn't as common (USB-C cable, grr).

I wanted to make some sort of small talk with him to remove some of the tension from the situation, but I didn't really know what to say, so we wished each other a good day (empty politeness) and I left quickly.

The first one is that I\'m not sure if I could ever pass (I\'ve had people call me ma\'am but I\'m never really sure if they\'re just being polite), and I\'m concerned that if I get voice surgery that if I decide that if this isn\'t for me that I\'ll never be able to live down what I\'ve done to myself. I really am anxious to get it done as soon as possible because I feel like it\'s preventing me from passing, and it\'s slowly driving me insane because I\'m almost full time and I just don\'t want to admit it to myself, and I feel like once I open my mouth everything falls apart. I was considering getting a shave done first, but that will delay the voice surgery and reduce the amount of adjustment they can make (Yeson strongly cautioned against having it done by anyone except Facial Team when I emailed them), and I\'ve been told that my Adam\'s apple isn\'t that prominent by a few people including the surgeon during my consult. I have considered doing voice therapy, but I\'ve tried doing some voice training on my own and even if I was successful I\'d feel like my voice was fake, and the anxiety about slipping up would be too much for me.\n\nI get extremely agoraphobic on the weekends. It\'s not as bad as it used to be, but even when I manage to drag myself out of the house I avoid people.

Posted this to r/lgbt and someone there suggested I might get better responses and insight here. Feel free to let me know if there is a more appropriate space in another subreddit for this discussion. :) tl;dr at the bottom.

I've recently begun exploring my gender identity and I'm not too sure where I stand or am uber familiar with gender discourse and terminology, but here are some details about me:

* I am gay/am attracted to masculinity
* AMAB and do not feel enough discomfort with my assigned sex to the point where I'm seriously considering transitioning
* I feel neither exclusively male nor exclusively female in gender
* I don't fully subscribe to either of the traditional male or female gender roles
* I mostly dress in male clothes, have a beard, and short hair
* My natural inclination is to act in a feminine manner
* I tend to associate more/feel more comfortable socializing with those who are neither super feminine nor super masculine

I go to a dance studio and take classes that are very femme in style; e.g., femme hip hop/jazz funk, waacking, vogue, heels. Recently, I started taking a heels class where the instructor is a cisfemale and I'm feeling excluded/like the odd person out. Most of her students are also cisfemale and I am one of the few ""males"" there.

I'm not sure if she does them consciously or subconsciously, but the instructor says/does things that seem to favor cisfemales and come off as microaggressions to me. For example, in one class where I was the only one who wasn't cisfemale, she praised the ladies for doing a good job, but then said ""Oh and gentleman, too."" I'd actually feel much more comfortable and included if she had just left it at ""Great job ladies"" than her singling me out. In fact, when dance instructors separate students to perform in groups based on their gender, I often (half-jokingly) say ""I'm a lady"" because I don't quite feel like a ""man"".

She also has parts of the choreography where she has us whip our hair, but then tells the guys: ""For you men, you can do this instead."" I do have short hair, so I guess this is somewhat understandable.

I also notice that she directs her attention and individual praises toward the cisfemales. It somewhat feels like she is affirming cisfemale gender performance and doesn't quite know what to think of my femme non-cis style.

I suppose what I need help with is unpacking my reactions to her actions/words. Is this just insecurity talking? Has anyone ever felt excluded in female-centric spaces where ""female"" seems to mean female in physical sexual characteristics, gender identity, and gender presentation?

I'm also trying to fit my thoughts into a context of feminism and female empowerment. I understand that as an AMAB, I am unable to quite identify with the experiences that these women share together, but I don't think that should preclude me from feeling empowered in female-centric spaces. I fully embrace being femme and feeling sexy and powerful in a feminine manner in my dance classes, but I can't help but feel boxed out of these identities and boxed into being male in situations like those above.

Would truly appreciate any thoughts y'all have. Thanks so much.

**tl;dr I am a gay non-binary/genderqueer person who presents as mostly male on the outside but is really into feeling/being femme.

I found rightfitforyou.com but it doesn't seem to have a large database yet due to the fact that it found no one near me even though I live in a highly populated metro area.

I am a fully androgynous person - I'm not seeking physical transition for various reasons but getting buff will end up being an integral part of my expression. The problem is that even with that and my health at stake, I have trouble actually starting. Once I get started on something, I keep going but when I try to work out, something starts getting sore or I'm pushing myself too hard and I give up. Hence, I really think a personal trainer is required to help me on that path.

I really don't want to deal with microaggressions or gendering bullshit when I already have a problem with motivation.

42,2017-06-09 16:07:32,6g9d0m,20,20,"I was born female, but I've never felt like a girl.  Inside myself I've always felt male.  When I was in kindergarten I wanted to be a boy when I grew up (I didn't know that wasn't something you could aspire to).  If I dress up like a lady, wear make-up hang out with other women, I feel like an imposter, a very uncomfortable imposter.  Fortunately I don't have to do those things very often.  It helps that all my friends are men.

Being female it doesn't affect my life as much as it probably would if I were male and wanted to be female.  There are some advantages to it (I'm thinking mainly of you multiple orgasms, I would miss you so if you left me).  I guess my dysphoria doesn't rise to a level where I feel I must become something else.  I'm ok with being externally female and feeling internally male, it doesn't cause me many problems. The problems I do have with it are more those of confusion, not feeling like I can define myself or like I really belong in either world.  Or that I'm just not quite man enough to really be one of the guys (though it's close) and I'll never be anywhere near female enough to be one of the girls.

Nonetheless in spite of this confusion I do feel my identity is largely intact.  I know who I am, it's other people who can't get on board.  It's my male friends who don't understand that I have as much right to boys night out as they do.  Zero valid excuses, I'm bi and worse about checking out girls than any of them, better at getting the bartenders attention, still waiting on something better than ""because you have a pussy,"" they know damn well that's bullshit.  I don't expect women to understand me, they're a total mystery to me too.  I hate being excluded by both groups, I know it's just that feeling of not belonging anywhere.

What do you even call feeling this way? Gender-Fluid?  How do other people manage, I know others experience fear more difficult problems and sadness but this feels like such a weight sometimes.

There are some advantages to it (I\'m thinking mainly of you multiple orgasms, I would miss you so if you left me).  I guess my dysphoria doesn\'t rise to a level where I feel I must become something else.  I\'m ok with being externally female and feeling internally male, it doesn\'t cause me many problems. The problems I do have with it are more those of confusion, not feeling like I can define myself or like I really belong in either world.  Or that I\'m just not quite man enough to really be one of the guys (though it\'s close) and I\'ll never be anywhere near female enough to be one of the girls.\n\nNonetheless in spite of this confusion I do feel my identity is largely intact.  I know who I am, it\'s other people who can\'t get on board.  It\'s my male friends who don\'t understand that I have as much right to boys night out as they do.  Zero valid excuses, I\'m bi and worse about checking out girls than any of them, better at getting the bartenders attention, still waiting on something better than ""because you have a pussy,"" they know damn well that\'s bullshit.  I don\'t expect women to understand me, they\'re a total mystery to me too.  I hate being excluded by both groups, I know it\'s just that feeling of not belonging anywhere.\n\nWhat do you even call feeling this way? Gender-Fluid?  How do other people manage, I know others experience fear more difficult problems and sadness but this feels like such a weight sometimes. I understand why people want to transition, they just want their outsides to match their insides, they want to be seen as they really are.

47,2017-06-10 09:32:12,6gef1b,13,14,"Hello. I hope this is the right place. I would have posted in r/questioning otherwise, but I have come to the conclusion that the label ""genderqueer"" might sum me up pretty good. I'm looking to get some things sorted out in my head and have a few questions about it though. I explain each one from a personal POV. 

1) can you have a binary identity and still be genderqueer or is this strictly under the non-binary umbrella? Or is GQ the umbrella term or is it just an alternative, parallel one? 

The reason I'm asking is because I have no issue with identifying as a girl or being called that. I feel a bit uncomfortable when somebody rubs it in my face or makes a big deal of it, but most of the time I don't get dysphoric thoughts or bouts of depresssion out of that alone. ""Woman"" is a bit worse, but I guess there are other issues and (~personal) connotations at play that I'm dealing with at the same time. 

2) Perhaps related, but how non-conforming are most GQ people you've met personally? 

I'm not exactly looking for an explaination on ""how to be x/am I x enough"", but roughly, what level of non-conformity in expression is worthy of even being mentioned or noted (.. to *self* mostly, my culture and language don't have a translation of those terms afaik and that's part of the reason I've come to terms with ""yeah I'm a girl I guess k""). 

3) This one might be the most pressing one. How... does one proceed? 

What do I do now? I have no desire to go on 'mones as I'm just getting my skin sorted out, depression is actually feeling better on BC oddly and I'd have virtually no access, binders don't work (any advice on how to come to terms with boobs? What to think of them, how to argue and persuade myself that it's ok to have them and deal with them so that I don't feel like they give the wrong impression of me as a person?) 
I'm relatively curvy and most men's clothes look super awkward on me. I do however have a thing for sportier outfits, gadgets and hunting knives and fancy things that absolutely *scream* masculinity, and not just from a practical viewpoint; it's often a combination of the idea and the item's quality/style that I find endearing. Wearing boxers, too, and a few other oddities from men's departments. 

Related to the next question, how do I explore this and find balance, avoid an overly butch lesbian look while not compromising on authentic and right-feeling gender expression (biology already has me screwed, I can't afford that)? 

4) Is this going to mean my already limited heterosexuality is going to be limited further by people assuming things/most finding me unattractive?  

I... like boys. A certain subset of them anyway. And no, I'm not looking to be told that gender and sexuality are separate, I know that's the consensus. They seem pretty tied up to me though. I feel quite masculine with a male partner. More feminine with a female one. I prefer both be feminine or at least *unmasculine* themselves and it's the balance of gender expressions, the similarity and alikeness that I find most liberating and bonding. 
Thing is, most boys are going to be turned off by whatever I'm about to do. True, I'm going to filter out some real dollopheads this way and most of the ubermasc-traditional ones (hopefully). Should I make it *clear* in a group that I'm into boys when I spot an attractive one? 

Like, is it hopeless to be into boys and try to do something about the gender thing as well? I feel like proceeding otherwise and continuing to present in a feminine manner would be deceptive and bring hurtful, unwanted results. Is there another way? Looking to cheat the system with a clever hack, probably. 

Last but not least, I'm looking for a *rational, helpful* reply. If I said something wrong or insensitive, do say, but let's not fall to the trap of semantics or ""oh no, you're *really just trans but afraid*, you should transition asap!"" - not going to happen, ever. I'd make an ugly guy with a receding jaw and nonexistent self-esteem, so let us not waste any time on that terrible notion.

Currently, I am trying incredibly hard to »accept myself«. I am 22 years old and never felt like I fit in the traditional gender binary. As a child, my parents basically raised me pretty unisex, I mostly played with boys and was primarily also into boy’s activities. I never really liked wearing girl’s clothes (although »being a girl«, although lately I feel less hostile towards potentially wearing a dress, I think my insecurity regarding this has to do a lot with my parents (who are pretty narcissistic) making comments about my experience whenever they could. I.e. I never tried wearing makeup because I did not want anyone to comment on me wearing makeup, I never experimented with clothing much because I did not want to comment anyone on it. I simply hate it when people say something about the way I present myself, both positive and negative. 

I am pretty content with my body. I don’t think I am particularly physically attractive, but the only times I ever felt uncomfortable with having breasts, for example, was during early puberty when once again my parents made comments about said thing happening. But at the same time I sometimes would like to try binding, simply to see how I would feel.

So, I dress pretty »androgynous« and when I recently found out that my name was actually a unisex name in Dutch/French it made me incredibly happy. At some days, I would just like to wake up and be a girl, at others I would just like to have short hair and a mustache, on others I would to be a genderless cyborg.

However, one thing that caused me to feel very off the grid is this: 
I grew up feeling very isolated and started using chatrooms when I was probably 13 years old. Throughout this time I also began to introduce myself to others as an older boy. From what I sense this is probably caused by two things: a) I was bullied in school by a group of older boys and was afraid that if I would reveal anyone I was a girl, they would perceive me as weak, bully me, and so on; b) I also felt much more confident hiding behind this mask, I knew that I was not vulnerable if people never saw a picture of myself (i.e. even with accounts that did not contain any personal information and on which I did not tell anyone something about myself, I felt way more confident than when there was a photo of me – simply because of this incredibly fear of being bullied for my looks again). However, this »catfishing« went on for a couple of years and I feel very guilty for doing it. I am very glad that I am now slowly able to distance myself from it by being more present in real life and by slowly working on myself, and I also know that this was an escapist coping mechanism for me to escape from a very dull, lonely life. I don’t want anyone to sympathize with me for being a former catfishet, I just think this may be a key point of my problem as a whole.

I also have a lot of trouble letting people get close to me in real life because I am so afraid to be hurt. I am trying to be more conscious and listen to people, be more open to them (about panic attacks I have, for example) and the reactions are less horrible than I imagine them being.
So presenting myself as someone online somehow helped me to connect with people, but you know, I want to connect with them as myself but I simply don’t know how to start because there is so much anxiety involved.

I am just so, so confused at the moment. Although I identify as transgender in a way and feel like that I do somehow feel like the term »genderfluid/genderqueer« belongs to me, I am having intrusive thoughts that cause me a lot of anxiety. Thoughts that are basically like: No, you’re actually a man! And it’s freaking me out for some reason, and I don’t know why – is this some sort of internalized transphobia? And how do I get over it?
Some years ago I also went through a similar phase: I was obsessed with eventually being lesbian, did a lot of those online tests, and so on; until I finally came to terms with being attracted to people regardless of what their gender is. It just »magically« happened at some point and I stopped having these thoughts, but then moved on and obsessed about another thing.

Is there any advice you could possibly offer me? I don’t know anyone who identifies as queer and would like to talk to someone (perhaps in private, too?). Once I brought this topic up with a friend and she said nothing but: »You are not trans, you have long hair« – which was so unhelpful and frustrating.

I would just really like to come to terms with my identity, feel content with who I am and be able to live without having doubts and anxiety 24/7, it’s really killing me right now.

At some days, I would just like to wake up and be a girl, at others I would just like to have short hair and a mustache, on others I would to be a genderless cyborg.\n\nHowever, one thing that caused me to feel very off the grid is this: \nI grew up feeling very isolated and started using chatrooms when I was probably 13 years old. Throughout this time I also began to introduce myself to others as an older boy. From what I sense this is probably caused by two things: a) I was bullied in school by a group of older boys and was afraid that if I would reveal anyone I was a girl, they would perceive me as weak, bully me, and so on; b) I also felt much more confident hiding behind this mask, I knew that I was not vulnerable if people never saw a picture of myself (i.e. even with accounts that did not contain any personal information and on which I did not tell anyone something about myself, I felt way more confident than when there was a photo of me – simply because of this incredibly fear of being bullied for my looks again). However, this »catfishing« went on for a couple of years and I feel very guilty for doing it. I am very glad that I am now slowly able to distance myself from it by being more present in real life and by slowly working on myself, and I also know that this was an escapist coping mechanism for me to escape from a very dull, lonely life. I don’t want anyone to sympathize with me for being a former catfishet, I just think this may be a key point of my problem as a whole.\n\nI also have a lot of trouble letting people get close to me in real life because I am so afraid to be hurt. I am trying to be more conscious and listen to people, be more open to them (about panic attacks I have, for example) and the reactions are less horrible than I imagine them being.\nSo presenting myself as someone online somehow helped me to connect with people, but you know, I want to connect with them as myself but I simply don’t know how to start because there is so much anxiety involved.\n\nI am just so, so confused at the moment. Although I identify as transgender in a way and feel like that I do somehow feel like the term »genderfluid/genderqueer« belongs to me, I am having intrusive thoughts that cause me a lot of anxiety. Thoughts that are basically like: No, you’re actually a man! And it’s freaking me out for some reason, and I don’t know why – is this some sort of internalized transphobia? And how do I get over it?\nSome years ago I also went through a similar phase: I was obsessed with eventually being lesbian, did a lot of those online tests, and so on; until I finally came to terms with being attracted to people regardless of what their gender is. It just »magically« happened at some point and I stopped having these thoughts, but then moved on and obsessed about another thing.\n\nIs there any advice you could possibly offer me? I don’t know anyone who identifies as queer and would like to talk to someone (perhaps in private, too?). Once I brought this topic up with a friend and she said nothing but: »You are not trans, you have long hair« – which was so unhelpful and frustrating.\n\nI would just really like to come to terms with my identity, feel content with who I am and be able to live without having doubts and anxiety 24/7, it’s really killing me right now. \n\nThank you everyone in advance already.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I am super confused/anxious about myself, would like to accept myself and am seeking out advice.', 'created': 1497377247.0}"

57,2017-06-13 13:05:29,6gzqee,5,2,"I am 24, AMAB, and I've been on HRT for about three months; until I started to experience gender dysphoria a /lot/ (I had had it from being about 14 but it never got particularly bad until about 22), I had never suspected that I'd be trans: I liked girls, I liked my voice, I looked up to masculine role models, I wanted to be strong and stoic and honourable like (*Sigh* cringey, I know), Ned Stark, or Jon Snow. 

And sometimes, I still do want that. But I get dysphoria now about my body, a lot of the time I want boobs, I look at beautiful young girls and feel intense jealousy, but then I also look at strong, well-bearded guys and ALSO feel intense jealousy (Might sound embarrassing but one of the guys I'm most jealous of is Geralt of Rivia &gt;.&gt;) But then I've had times where I get all done up in makeup, put on feminine clothing and pass, and it feels amazing... But neither mode feels like me, and I worry that HRT is permanently transforming me into just one mode, as my changes have been occurring -very- quickly. (I have wondered if I might have an intersex condition or something, considering how I've always looked pretty effeminate even when not trying to). 

I've told myself ""Oh, you can just transition and then dress masc, wear a binder or something"", but I also desperately don't want to lose genital function, which I've been lucky to have had basically unchanged so far despite other changes. I wish that I could find some kind of middle ground, and I've been wondering if it might be better to just stop HRT and call myself a non-binary male, even though I don't feel it captures the full essence of my character. 

My dysphoria comes and goes in constant fluctuation; sometimes I feel like HRT is turning out to be a great idea, other days I want to rip off the patch and stop before I complete the process of some terrible mistake. I've basically accepted now that I am not cisgendered, but personality-wise I have a pretty masculine personality (at least I -think- I do). At the same time I've never been able to engage in many traditional masculine activities due to a disability in my legs, so I'm not going to say that's not a factor in my own perceived lack of masculinity. 

I just wish I had SOME direction; I'm getting private HRT and private therapy, I have to wait until February for proper GIC appointment, and I genuinely just wonder if my feminising myself is a bit of a hasty decision I've made, even though the progress has been what I sometimes consider promisingly and other times consider terrifyingly, swift. How am I supposed to know what to do if I go between being desperately wanting something and being absolutely terrified of it and feeling against it?

I'm out socially to some friends, my boyfriend's family and my work-from-home job. I'm not out to my family yet because I have ultra conservative parents and lots of anxiety, but I'm working on it. 

Basically, once I'm out to my family (I know I probably need to be out to them before any of this can start), I'd like to pursue HRT and top surgery, and I just had a couple of questions for any of you who have medically transitioned in the UK specifically. (Also, if someone has already made a similar thread, please feel free to point me in that direction!)

1. Has being non-binary or genderfluid impacted your transition in any way? e.g. accessing resources for transition, having to explain non-binary genders to professionals, etc. 

2. My end goal, really, is to be more androgynous than outright masculine; however, I do want to be 'read' as male over female, because I'm super fuckin' tired of being always read as female. In particular, I definitely want a deeper voice and to flatten out some of my curves a bit (I definitely want my chest gone, which is why I'm looking at top surgery later on), but I don't want to be like ... 100% Manly Man. I like the idea of still being somewhat feminine, just not so much so that I'm read as female. Is this actually possible or will I just have to accept being more masculine than I'd like in order to actually feel at home/not constantly anxious in my skin?

3. What has been your overall experience in dealing with health services re: transitioning as a non-binary/genderfluid person? Positive, negative, neither? Doesn't have to be an essay, I just want to know going in whether I'm going to need to brace myself for it to be a struggle.

I then texted back saying I should go out as my genderqueer self, Mia. She said if I was comfortable doing so I totally should! So for the days before our lunch/shopping day I seriously thought about going, and not going.

I decided I probably wouldn't have another opportunity to do something like this in an environment like a mall so I did. Because I'm not out at home, I wore my clothes under my male clothes (never again will I wear jeans under jeans) and did my makeup minimally as I intended to do it in the car.

So we have lunch, it's pretty decent and we drive a couple blocks down to the mall. Once the car stopped and parked I knew it was now or never. I said I was ready so I took off my guy clothes to reveal the clothes underneath and touched up my makeup. This part is the only thing I'm mad about because the stuff I use for my brows melted (I probably shouldn't have left my purse in the car, but I wasn't dressed at the restaurant) and today my wings decided to not cooperate so just went without any :(. Honestly I'm so mad about it still lol. Also my good friend five o clock shadow decided to stop by (I made sure to shave as close as possible and cover it up the best I could). While it wasn't prominent I could see it in the mirror a little bit. I grabbed my wig and made sure it was placed perfectly and we got out of the car. She said I looked good even though I knew I didn't pass as well as I hoped (damn you makeup and hot weather) but it was great she didn't laugh or have any reaction like that. In fact she treated it as if it was nothing and like it was natural, so bless her for that!

We stopped at a couple stores where she tried on some stuff and I tried on one thing but ended up not getting it because I was on a budget lol. In fact I even got ""she'd"" while waiting in line for the dressing room so that was totally awesome! I was still incredibly nervous and shy because I felt like the employees saw through my passing attempt but they treated me like any other customer. Also while walking thorugh the mall I didn't get as many stares or any under the breath remarks as I could tell, which is still totally awesome!

My friend needed to go the restroom. Oh boy the big restroom moment. Before going in I was thinking should I go in with her or wait outside. I ended up waiting outside, mainly since I didn't need to go or check my tuck (which held pretty well throughout the day). This was my first moment alone and I just waited for her as I stared at my phone trying not to make any eye contact. While she was in the dressing rooms I was left alone for a couple minutes a time so I was really nervous then. As soon as she came out I immediately went straight to her lol.

We went to a couple more stores and Sephora. Now I had been makeup shopping before, but just as a guy so it wasn't something too out of left field for me. The lady at the cashier was super nice and welcoming also. My friend said I should get a makeover and get help for anything but decided not to, mainly because I didn't want to buy anything, have her wait for me, and I would end up just taking it off several minutes after on the way home.

As we were walking back to her car we almost ran into two people we knew. She ran into someone she knew on our way in, so I sort of just looked the other way. She totally could tell I wasn't ready for a confrontation with these two people, especially because I'm not out to everyone so she asked if I wanted to chill and we did until he was out of sight.

Driving on the way home she asked how I felt and I said way better than I had thought, and that I would totally do it again! So to my friend, thank you for being just so totally open minded and comforting me, and just treating me like a normal friend. It was a huge confidence booster having you around! Like I couldn't ask for anything more.

Maybe next time my makeup will be more forgiving to me lol.

Also, to anybody out there worried about going out in public for the first time it's not as scary as you think. Sure I was super self conscious and I had a million thoughts going on at once, but really that's just your brain and your comfort zone trying to tell you otherwise (unless you're not in a safe area, that I totally understand is a different situation). Just do it when you're ready and take baby steps if you have to. Go with a friend, it'll be much easier!

I was originally going to do a long post now about where i've got up to since then, but instead i thought it might be more fun to do a lost of cool things that i've discovered/re-discovered about feeling more femme and being honest with myself.

1) Jeggings are awesome!!!! So i ordered what I THOUGHT was a pair of Zara Women's low rise jeans from Ebay (broke shopping haha). When they arrived they had no front pockets, fit really tight in the best possible way, and were really stretchy....my S/O informed me they were in fact Jeggings. No loss to me coz they're super comfy, fit better then any pair of jeans i've ever owned and make me feel way more femme, particularly when paired with item 2). 

2) T shirt dresses - I'd been wearing longline mens shirts for awhile because they felt more Androgynous then standard Guy fit shirts, but actually getting some T shirt dresses (in my case, an All Saints one via Ebay- broke shopping again) has made me feel great. It look enough like a longline T-shirt to ""pass"" which is helpful to me because I'm not out in general socially (although I'm now operating a strict no lying/denying rule - see number 3) but makes me feel more balanced, and covers any ""give away features"" that might occur when wearing super tight jeans/jeggings!!

3) Being honest with myself. Im now operating a strict No Lying/Denying Policy...which in practice means I'm under no pressure to actively tell anyone about my Gender Identity (after all, it's my business right?) but If anyone asks or raises Gender as an issue, Im not going to deny who I am anymore. I've ""officially"" come out to my S/O, and a couple of close friends, and though it was hard, no one has been mean or actively tried to make me feel bad which is ace. Im not naive enough to think my relationship with myself/Gender will always be easy (it still isn't in fact) but I feel better knowing that Im not lying to myself or anyone else anymore. 

4) Smooth Armpits - I've Actively been doing bits of hair removal for a long time, and in fact It was kind of part of what led me to think about my Gender Identity in the first place, but I had never have my armpits until after I came out on here, and to my S/O. 

I guess its not something that is easily explained as ""societally normal"" for AMAB people, which even shaved legs are (if you want to pretend you're a cyclist or something!) so for me at least, it kinda felt like a small but relevant step to feeling more Androgyne. Anyways, smooth armpits feel great!

5) ""Passing"" as Being an enigma - I think it's ace when people want to mess with societal expectations and present in ways that some people might find strange, but thats not really me as i'm kinda shy in an overexcited talks-too-much-when-nervous way (if that makes sense) Anyways, today I was at Boots (a drugstore/pharmacy here in the UK) buying a bunch of face care stuff. When I got to the checkout the girl serving me was asked a question by another staff member and she replied

""hold on, let me just serve this........person........first"". I was wearing cherry tinted Lip Balm, foundation and eyeliner, but as it was a crazy  hot makeup melting day i'm pretty sure my stubble shadow was showing....Maybe she was just being Gender-Neutral-Descriptor awesome, but I felt like she couldn't tell my Gender, and that made me really happy.

96,2017-06-19 19:10:11,6i8lrm,3,5,"I had a therapy appointment this morning, and discussed some anger, frustration, and anxiety I've felt around certain kinds of social interactions throughout my life.

In particular, we discussed my struggles with the dominance-submissiveness binary. I'm male, and I believe male-male interactions (but also interactions in general) are just rife with hierarchy and attempts to dominate that *really* frustrate me. (This is less of an issue now, but was definitely an issue during my childhood, and I still carry some emotional baggage about it.)

My understanding of myself is that I reject dominance in all forms -- feel no desire to dominate others and also feel intense anger when other people try to dominate or humiliate me. I want egalitarianism, basically.

But my therapist has asked me to reflect on whether maybe my style is actually consistent with submissiveness. She inferred from some anecdotes I told her that -- when pressed to choose between dominating someone or submitting to them -- I have chosen submission (at least some of the time).

However recently I've been thinking about transitioning (mtf) or at least taking hormones. On one hand I'm not entirely uncomfortable being male, but on the other I wouldn't mind being perceived as female and to live as one. This is the point where I'm at and confused about. I've think that my male-ness is more from expression rather than it being identity, but I can't be for sure. For example last week I went to a friend's graduation party and found myself subconsciously standing with the girls rather than the guys, and thinking about this made me remember the other times this has happened before. But like I said, I'm not entirely uncomfortable being male, but there are those times. I know I'm not cis and at the very least I'm genderfluid/genderqueer. which I'm not ashamed of identifying as at the moment.

HRT has mainly been on my mind, but I'm not sure if it's something to help my identity rather than expression. I've been seeing all the posts on places like /r/transpassing and feeling jealous, so again I'm not sure if it's because I want to transition and identify fully as a woman or not. I know there's that question people always ask that if you had a button that can change your gender would you press it and I would.

My next issue is basically everybody's issue when questioning gender and that's coming out. I know most of my friends will be 100% supportive, but I'm afraid of doing so to my parents and family. I'd say my family is fairly moderate when it comes to issues like these, not too liberal or conservative. We do have two uncles that are gay and everybody is fine with that so I'm pretty sure they would be fine with me being trans, but can't be too sure. I'm also a little worried how some friends would take it that I haven't come out to.

And as of now, if hypothetically my coming out goes great, I probably wouldn't be able to start going to a therapist or to start HRT since there's some pretty big things going on right now financially wise and with insurance, so I don't expect starting soon, and maybe in at least a year. Also my parents would be paying for everything so that's why I feel I should come out to them.

I guess I'm having a hard time distinguishing identity and expression and whether or not transitioning would help me with dysphoria.

The past 3 months I've really been giving this thought and it took me 2 years to come to the conclusion I'm genderfluid now, so I'll definitely be giving this more thought.

Writing this makes me realize that some days I'll be totally happy identifying as genderfluid but other days I wish I would be ""binary"" transgender and transition completely and only identify as female, which is where the ""button"" scenario comes from, as well as some of my dysphoria. I know a lot of gf/nb people who do take hormones so I could also do that and again see how I feel about it.

I know each person has a different definition of genderfluid and not everybody follows the same path transitioning, so I guess it's hard for me really to define my identity. Maybe I'm still thinking about this from a ""cis"" perspective since that's the way I've been trained to think that way for the 19 years I've been alive and that I'm still trying distinguish my expression and identity.

I experience mild dysphoria 30-50% about of the time, especially when wearing feminine clothes. I'm not beating myself up too much about the clothes dilemma though, because I can't purchase my own clothes and I'm home wearing pajamas and sweats like, 90% of the time, so I don't feel too self-conscious. 

I'm fourteen, I'm figuring stuff out; it doesn't matter. I've got time.

My only issue is my name. I don't feel comfortable sharing it on here or anywhere, it doesn't feel right for me, I cringe every time I see or hear it used in relation to me... it's a total headache. 

I don't know what name to pick, or if I want to change it that much... I also feel like changing my name, even if just to my friends and social media, would be incredibly disrespectful to my mom. It's not an ugly name, it's a name that was chosen after someone important to the family... just- throwing it away feels so horrible. But I can't use it anymore.

I'd like my name to be relatively short, unisex and (preferably) start with an A. I know it seems silly to want a name that is so similar to the one I have now but being called [insert birth name here] all my life and suddenly switching to something like ""Perry"" is just... //weird//.

Has anyone had any problems choosing a name? Does anyone have any suggestions for a name for me? I'm pretty open to anything right now, tbh.

135,2017-06-26 01:35:57,6ji6s0,8,4,"Hello, y'all!
Lately, I've been trying to refer to my fursona in less gendered way as an experimentation for myself, and I've caught myself thinking about 'it' for a while. In portuguese I've never heard the ""elu"" pronouns (a gender-neutral pronoun in PT) being spoken, just written. So IRL I wouldn't mind being called in any way - for I am AMAB and I don't care about looks, and mostly the 'standard (not so genderless) look' is basically masculine, I get treated as a boy; which might get frustrating when people have the strong urge to force that 'gender mask/uniform' on me, while I've never explicitly given any reason to do so.
But the english language makes it a bit more interesting to me. I've learnt that the pronoun 'it' is used to animals and inanimate objects, i.e. 'it' is oblivious to society's understanding of gender; while 'them' is neutral and still seems to expect a clarification on the gender, be it binary or nonbinary. Considering the pronoun 'it' might mean I'm agender, but I don't know (can any agender person out there comment if this sounds like agender for ya?); as an ace aro I would say it should be easier to know how that feels for sure, but well... It's not. What I do know is that the most often I just wish not to fit any gender.

TL;DR: 'it' seems to explicitly point out inapplicability of gender, not just neutrality, and I'm willing to experiment how that feels.

151,2017-06-27 21:48:53,6jw1sm,13,7,"Hi, I'm just curious what people in this sub do about different languages and the way that gender is treated in those languages, or problems they have faced in languages other than English.

Some languages and cultures seem more resistant to coming up with gender-neutral solutions than others--and in some languages, it's not an issue. I searched the sub for discussions on this topic and I found [this post about languages in general](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1m52v1/if_you_were_using_a_language_that_uses_gender/), [this post mostly about Romance languages](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/5rae4s/my_choice_of_pronouns_for_my_partners_native/), and [this news article about Hebrew](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/08/11/what-does-a-gender-neutral-kid-call-themself-in-a-gendered-language/).

Personally, I have felt really held back when speaking Spanish, even though I have a pretty good comprehension level of the language. But since I was young I always felt uncomfortable if I have to say anything about myself in Spanish, because it would force me to think about and express my gender. So, I developed a habit of simply never sayng anything about myself or just expressing things about me in roundabout ways. Recently I learned that some nonbinary and genderqueer speakers of Spanish have been using ""-e"" on the ends of words and using ""elle"" as a gender neutral pronoun. It's not official, but I hope that it gains popularity and I would be curious to know if anyone here speaks Spanish and could elaborate on this.

I also speak Esperanto and in Esperanto I feel it's much easier to be gender neutral. It's very similar to English when it comes to the pronoun choices (""she"" = ""ŝi"", ""he"" = ""li"", they = ""ili"", it = ""ĝi"") and lack of gendering via verbs and adjectives, but there is arguably more progress with a 3rd person singular gender neutral pronoun (""ri"") than in English. The pronoun is unofficial but I think the majority of long-time speakers are familiar with its existence and understand its meaning as it has been in existence since the 1970's, as far as I know. If someone tries to argue with you about it, it's generally because they don't like new words in the language (and because originally ""it"" or ""ĝi"" was not an offensive term for humans), not because they think being nonbinary is invalid (although of course those people exist, too). I find that gender neutrality and pronoun use are a very frequent topic of discussion in the Esperanto community and peoples opinions tend to boil down to grammar worries, not so much on fighting about trans people. Most people who don't want to use ""ri"" still try to help people come up with a solution for being gender neutral that still follows the traditional rules of the language (I could go into detail on this if anyone is curious). 

Finally, I have been learning Korean and for the most part, it's very convenient because unlike many languages I have explored in the past, verbs and adjectives do nothing to reveal one's gender, and there are virtually no gendered pronouns--you can become specific about gender if it's necessary, but you actually just do not include 3rd person pronouns almost all of the time. That's very convenient for a nonbinary person. However, there is also a system of kinship terms and other social titles that can get very specific about gender. Common ones are words that you call people who you are close with, that happen to rely not only their gender, but yours as well. If you are male, you call older males ""hyung"" and older females ""nuna"" and if you are female you call older males ""oppa"" and older females ""unnie"". I don't feel confident enough in this language to be calling any shots on how to deal with this issue as a nonbinary person, but I am curious if anyone here speaks Korean and knows of a solution.

164,2017-06-30 21:13:57,6kivhy,19,12,"I've recently had a problem happen multiple times on social media, all with people who I know from real life, of like, people will bend over backwards to respect my gender identity, sometimes like, profuse / repeated apologies for misgendering, or apologizing for things that don't even bother me like addressing a group of people including me as ""you guys"", but like, when a conversation becomes tense, especially if/when I'm voicing a more conservative viewpoint on a particular issue, or disagreeing with a particular point being made in a feminist discussion, all this goes out the window, and people will treat me very aggressively and often accuse me of ""mansplaining"" or say ""well you're just a man so you blah blah blah..."" and then spout a bunch of untruths about me.

I find it really frustrating for multiple reasons.  For one, I don't identify as a man and many of the things people say in their reasoning is outright wrong.  For two, I hate words like ""mansplaining"" from an ideological standpoint, they're unnecessarily gendered in ways that I think are binarist, and I also think they can reinforce toxic masculinity and have some anti-feminist effects even if people might claim to be coming from a feminist perspective when they say them.  And for three, when people respond with that sort of word or other similar dismissing ""Well you're just a man so blah blah blah..."" in response to me voicing either a more conservative viewpoint, or disagreeing with a point of feminist ideology, it plays into this awful stereotype that all trans people must think alike, so if you don't think like that then you're not legitimately trans you're just some shitty frat dudebro or whatever the left-wing stereotype is.

This stuff makes me feel like, I'm only trans when it feels good for other people to ""protect"" me.  I'm suddenly not trans when people dislike what I'm trying to say, especially if being ""male"" gives them fuel to attack me or dismiss my voice.

It's also especially frustrating because I feel like our society elevates masculinity over femininity, and I think that includes elevating a more aggressive ""This is the way it is."" way of wording statements...and like, I tend to word things more in a ""This is my experience."" type of way, using a lot of I-statements...and then I often get shut down, spoken over, and even shamed by women who criticize me for ""talking about myself"" when I'm using I-statements out of respect.  So it's like, from my perspective, I feel like I'm getting talked over and shut down a lot, because the way I communicate, presenting things as my own personal experience or perspective, is not taken as seriously by mainstream society...but then people accuse me of like, being in the ""dominant"" position in the power hierarchy because they gender me male.

I've had people react this way when I've raised concerns of how certain forms of feminism are reinforcing transphobia or binarism.  I've also had people react this way when I'm voicing viewpoints completely unrelated to feminism or gender, or related in other ways.  For example, recently I've gotten attacked a lot whenever I bring up the topic of fiscal conservatism.  I identify as a fiscal conservative and I find people make a lot of false assumptions about me on the basis of this, like they assume I want to cut social welfare programs or things like that, or assume that I agree with everything the Republican party has been advocating for recently, which is very far from the truth.

For example, today I was attacked in this way when I was voicing concerns about labor unions.  A major concern I raised was that I think labor unions can sometimes reinforce traditional sexism and other hierarchical power structures, and how I think it is frustrating when people on the left support unions unconditionally, and that I sometimes think that protecting oppressed people necessitates some degree of skepticism of labor unions.  And then I was accused of ""mansplaining"".

I don't expect or demand for people to agree with me.  But I want people to acknowledge the fact that I'm trans and nonbinary, transfeminine specifically, and that I can hold certain conservative viewpoints...in fact, that certain conservative viewpoints or stances that I hold, are a direct result of some of the experiences I've had with gender, which have showed me some of the problems, hypocrisies, or internal inconsistencies in some left-wing ideology.

Has anyone else encountered any problems like this?  Any advice about how to approach it?  I have been unfriending and blocking a lot of people recently, but it's frustrating because I feel like it just keeps happening...there's an almost endless supply of people in my social network who will dismiss or attack my gender as soon as I disagree with them even on a minor point of political or feminist ideology.",genderqueer,"Accusations of Mansplaining, Dismissing my Identity in Discussions of Politics or Feminism",1498882437.0,"{'created_utc': 1498857237, 'id': '6kivhy', 'num_comments': 19, 'score': 12, 'selftext': 'I\'ve recently had a problem happen multiple times on social media, all with people who I know from real life, of like, people will bend over backwards to respect my gender identity, sometimes like, profuse / repeated apologies for misgendering, or apologizing for things that don\'t even bother me like addressing a group of people including me as ""you guys"", but like, when a conversation becomes tense, especially if/when I\'m voicing a more conservative viewpoint on a particular issue, or disagreeing with a particular point being made in a feminist discussion, all this goes out the window, and people will treat me very aggressively and often accuse me of ""mansplaining"" or say ""well you\'re just a man so you blah blah blah..."" and then spout a bunch of untruths about me.\n\nI find it really frustrating for multiple reasons.

I'm in my mid-20's now and have a mostly male gender expression, although I have a lot of feminine expressions through my physicality, body language, clothes, jewelry, hair, etc. Enough to constantly get harassed by strangers for presumably being trans or gay (though I am neither). If I don't express myself in these ways, (or am pushed not to by work or the stage (costumes)) then I experience what I think could only be described as non-negligible gender dysphoria. I feel powerfully uncomfortable. 

But more to the point of this post, I know that I felt gender dysphoria MUCH more strongly from the ages of about 13-19. During this time I really felt the need to wear only women's clothing (not clothes as gendered as something like dresses, though I wanted to), I really hated the more masculine things about my body shape, and my body/facial hair was especially unpleasant. But gradually, I've become more comfortable with the masculine features of my body and have embraced them in some ways, as well as embracing slightly more masculine clothes and speech. I don't mind showing off my hairy chest under a slim-fitting v -neck anymore, whereas that used to feel really uncomfortable.
 
So I suppose my question is, are there a lot of others who have experienced something like this on a long-term scale? I've kind of felt weird about feeling less dysphoric than I used to... I sometimes feel like I've betrayed my own identity somehow, or that the pressure of society has succeeded in subconsciously influencing me, which I don't like.

Basically, once I'm out to my family (I know I probably need to be out to them before any of this can start), I'd like to pursue HRT and top surgery, and I just had a couple of questions for any of you who have medically transitioned in the UK specifically.

1. Has being non-binary or genderfluid impacted your transition in any way? e.g. accessing resources for transition, having to explain non-binary genders to professionals, etc. 

2. My end goal, really, is to be more androgynous than outright masculine; however, I do want to be 'read' as male over female, because I'm super fuckin' tired of being always read as female. In particular, I definitely want a deeper voice and to flatten out some of my curves a bit (I definitely want my chest gone, which is why I'm looking at top surgery later on), but I don't want to be like ... 100% Manly Man. I like the idea of still being somewhat feminine, just not so much so that I'm read as female. Is this actually possible or will I just have to accept being more masculine than I'd like in order to actually feel at home/not constantly anxious in my skin?

3. What has been your overall experience in dealing with health services re: transitioning as a non-binary/genderfluid person? Positive, negative, neither? Doesn't have to be an essay, I just want to know going in whether I'm going to need to brace myself for it to be a struggle.

This past week has helped me grow significantly. I've got a long way to go, but I'm taking the steps that I think will completely make me feel whole.

24,2017-06-17 01:10:55,6hqnyl,0,5,"So I was making plans to grab lunch with a friend I'm out to, and she had sort of playfully texted saying we should go to Sephora after lunch. I then texted back saying I should go out as my genderqueer self, Mia. She said if I was comfortable doing so I totally should! So for the days before our lunch/shopping day I seriously thought about going, and not going.

I decided I probably wouldn't have another opportunity to do something like this in an environment like a mall so I did. Because I'm not out at home, I wore my clothes under my clothes (never again will I wear jeans under jeans) and did my makeup minimally as I intended to do it in the car.

So we have lunch, it's pretty decent and we drive a couple blocks down to the mall. Once the car stopped and parked I knew it was now or never. I said I was ready so I took off my guy clothes to reveal the clothes underneath and touched up my makeup. This part is the only thing I'm mad about because the stuff I use for my brows melted (I probably shouldn't have left my purse in the car, but I wasn't dressed at the restaurant) and today my wings decided to not cooperate so just went without any :(. Honestly I'm so mad about it still lol. Also my good friend five o clock shadow decided to stop by (I made sure to shave as close as possible and cover it up the best I could). While it wasn't prominent I could see it in the mirror a little bit. I grabbed my wig and made sure it was placed perfectly and we got out of the car. She said I looked good even though I knew I didn't pass as well as I hoped (damn you makeup and hot weather) but it was great she didn't laugh or have any reaction like that. In fact she treated it as if it was nothing and like it was natural, so bless her for that!

We stopped at a couple stores where she tried on some stuff and I tried on one thing but ended up not getting it because I was on a budget lol. In fact I even got ""she'd"" while waiting in line for the dressing room so that was totally awesome! I was still incredibly nervous and shy because I felt like the employees saw through my passing attempt but they treated me like any other customer. Also while walking thorugh the mall I didn't get as many stares or any under the breath remarks as I could tell, which is still totally awesome!

My friend needed to go the restroom. Oh boy the big restroom moment. Before going in I was thinking should I go in with her or wait outside. I ended up waiting outside, mainly since I didn't need to go or check my tuck (which held pretty well throughout the day). This was my first moment alone and I just waited for her as I stared at my phone trying not to make any eye contact. While she was in the dressing rooms I was left alone for a couple minutes a time so I was really nervous then. As soon as she came out I immediately went straight to her lol.

We went to a couple more stores and Sephora. Now I had been makeup shopping before, but just as a guy so it wasn't something too out of left field for me. The lady at the cashier was super nice and welcoming also. My friend said I should get a makeover and get help for anything but decided not to, mainly because I didn't want to buy anything, have her wait for me, and I would end up just taking it off several minutes after on the way home.

As we were walking back to her car we almost ran into two people we knew. She ran into someone she knew on our way in, so I sort of just looked the other way. She totally could tell I wasn't ready for a confrontation with these two people, especially because I'm not out to everyone so she asked if I wanted to chill and we did until he was out of sight.

Driving on the way home she asked how I felt and I said way better than I had thought, and that I would totally do it again! So to my friend, thank you for being just so totally open minded and comforting me, and just treating me like a normal friend. It was a huge confidence booster having you around! Like I couldn't ask for anything more.

Maybe next time my makeup will be more forgiving to me lol.

Also, to anybody out there worried about going out in public for the first time it's not as scary as you think. Sure I was super self conscious and I had a million thoughts going on at once, but really that's just your brain and your comfort zone trying to tell you otherwise (unless you're not in a safe area, that I totally understand is a different situation). Just do it when you're ready and take baby steps if you have to. Go with a friend, it'll be much easier!

25,2017-06-17 07:10:04,6hs4m5,0,1,"Hi there! So I've been sorting through my emotions about my gender and making changes to help what I now know as dysphoria, starting with pronouns and yesterday asking people to start calling me a new gender neutral name. Both of these were MASSIVE steps for me, but I feel so much more comfortable in my own existence already. 

I've known I wanted to change my name legally for years now (yay for having a last name that is a constant reminder of an abusive family!). But it's always just been about changing my last name. Now with officially going through with the new name in my personal life, changing my first name wouldn't be that much of a stretch.

I just want a DSM or a professional who clearly isn't blinded by their ideology or religion or whatever.

I get some of the basics down. It's been almost a year in this closet. Running low on snacks and soda here. 

Why do people always assume they're the ""expert"" and then don't bother to check their own scripts and facts? Or fall into logical fallacies?

My barbies all married each other, GI Joe and Ken had some secret thing at one point and at one time or another peeing standing up just seemed more efficient (it's not but what did tiny mewdejour know). Worse things started happening by puberty though and I kept having serious dysphoria. I was stressed that I had breasts when I wanted a nice flat chest, and as weird as it sounds (or maybe not) I wanted to have sex like a man. It just daunted my mind that I didn't have a penis. It sometimes still does (more then sometimes). I feel like I really wish we could just retract or push out certain sexual traits that you wanted or didn't want at the time. 

At any rate fast forward to now. I finally shaved my head and have told my life companion and brother whom lives with us that I am gender fluid. They think it's the best thing ever. My mother who raised me to be a good little white, straight, house wife recently got a therapist who was genderqueer. The therapist was the best one she had ever had and she suddenly understood gender didn't define a person unless you decide to force that agenda on them (or that's their agenda which is fine too). I'm still afraid to tell her but I know when I am ready I will. 

And as a side note I have been tested for hormonal issues and psychological problems. Hormone levels are fine, I could use some vitamin D. Also because of my age when I started having the dysphoria the psych thinks I'm just fine and am genuinely just gender fluid. 

I think I just needed to post this to not feel so alone. It's so weird existing in a gender binary world. I am sick of living as a solitary genderfluid individual. If anyone has advice please send it my way.

Short answer: yes. Yet again you are currently reading yet another post about another individual who has come out as genderfluid. So, hello! Welcome, thank you for reading, and I hope a lovely person such as yourself who is taking the time to read this is having a lovely day/evening/night! My name is... well, not something I will not say as I prefer to private over the internet, but you can call me Marii - or K, Kemi, Onion, and etc. I am a cardbook of nicknames at this point as I love to attach myself to different given nicknames (my newest being Marii actually!). I am somehow twenty-two years of age as of March twenty-first, just as well AFAB. My pronouns at this current time in my life is she/her, as I've grown up with them for my entire life and cannot imagine of parting with them. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

As stated, I am genderfluid. Despite this I am not bothered by these set pronouns because mentally I never assigned much value to them, well that is until my days of being fully male come out and I simply replace those pronouns with he/him - which by the way rarely ever happens for me. Most of the time I linger in a very nonbinary state using neutral pronouns such as them/their (and even we/us when talking to myself funny enough), or within a neutral state somewhere between male and female or in a combination of the two. There are also those beloved rare times for me where I identify solely as a demiboy or demigirl and the last of them all as solely female. My switches usually occur on a monthly basis, sometimes with months of being one thing or by month to month of going in between something else. I've even had a year of being strictly in one gender, so as you can see my experience might be entirely different from your own - or the same, which I would be happy to talk about as I think it would be exciting to discuss. Anyway, now that I'm done covering the basis, let's get into the juicy stuff. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

As a child I knew who and what I was from the start. I, before discovering a broader term that felt true to me, was a being that liked both the girls and the boys and was ""male"" (more demiboy and neutral in that order, but child me knew nothing of these terms of course). In the mind of my childhood self if there were truly only two genders, I was a male. My genitalia was male and, of course by this notion, every other male would have had the same or similar physical features. This was proved wrong, as expected, and I was then explained to through elementary Sex Ed that I was anatomically female with all the parts and inner workings inside and out. I can tell you right now that to a child such as myself this didn't mean much to me. Take out the value of those words and the result on the matter is: I must have a boy-vagina. And so this is the philosophy I chose to live by, that is up until high school where hormones made things traumatically complicated and I was forced into accepting my body for what it was, how it operated, and why certain comments people made would affect me to the degree they did during many years of verbal bullying from elementary to high school. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

It took many years to realize I held different meanings and values for words ""male"" and ""female"" than literally every one else around me and to implement this as best I could. Because of such confusing time, I lost out on many opportunities but gained many different experiences. Even with the small normal experiences and milestones, I was always thankful because I could perceive the world (and quite frankly my own world) differently. Not everything meant the same for me, as I'm sure most of you have felt at one point or another and I always thought that was cool. Despite my depression which would often fluctuate from situational to major (and even psychotic at one point), I always felt impressed by myself for being like this. I could understand two different popularized viewpoints of this world (that being male and female), identify with both in different times in my life that taught me different things, and henceforth reach different outputs that made me interaction with this world so different and unique to me. It was something special that I treasure because I learned from the world differently and developed a broader mindset from the get go, and even got to teach something different and thought provoking to the many therapists I've had the pleasure of meeting that tell me they were happy to learn from and about me as they felt I broadened their own worlds. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

So, as you can probably see, being genderfluid is important to me and I hold it as something significant in my own personal development and growth as a human being - which is why I was even more excited the first time around when I discovered there were names for the things I felt finally and now I've discovered a whole community! You could say I'm as giddy about this as I was back then. I am happy to have found a safe space were there are others being true to themselves, or even just questioning themselves because I personally believe we need to constantly be questioning ourselves, our societal ideology, internal philosophies, teachings, intent, and belief systems to thrive in this current life. Well, at least only about the stuff that matters as we should be careful of promoting toxicity, self-harm/disrespect, self-fulfilling prophesies, false existence, and otherwise negative influences that don't meet internally who we know ourselves to be progressing as. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

On that note, I would like to continue on to document yet another leap made in my progression as a human being on this beautiful Earth. Recently I have come out to my mother as a genderfluid individual, which involved a ten page total essay with written and video evidence to back up this specific gender and several examples of my own experiences being genderfluid along with the trauma suffered from outside influences that only complicated this all because writing is a calling of mine that I would like to think that I thrive best in. Because of this incident of progression I was able to buy my very first packer recently, which I am very excited about using soon enough (or really just holding to be honest, as I think it will have more use as an emotional/mental healing tool that will be more similar to having a stress ball for me personally). Now, I am coming out to all of you reading. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

So, hello once again! My name is Marii, and I want to welcome you into a very important part of my life and just as well be welcomed into your own beautiful existences. I have plans to go around reading through this entire subreddit and most likely leave encouraging messages (which my social anxiety is already advising against). I hope we can friends, as I would be happy to befriend even more like-minded individuals and only have one other genderfluid friend that I met only weeks before this. Again, I hope life will be pleasant to you and thank you for reading, and I am terribly sorry to have posted such an overly long post.
