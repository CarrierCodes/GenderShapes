My parents are not transphobes, but are not very well informed about the topic (and their education on non-binary stuff is 0). This is the translation of the email I might send in a near future (translated from Catalan, our language):

&gt; Dear family,
&gt; 
&gt; Today I'm writing to you to explain something that, for me, is very special and important. It's something so personal that I have re-written this email many times. I have never found the courage to say it in a face-to-face conversation. I guess I'll go straight to the point, which is the easiest way to explain difficult things.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm non-binary.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if you expected that, I suppose not. In fact, you probably don't know what does that mean, so I'll explain it: ""non-binary"" (it's always used as an adjective) is a gender identity that describes those people who are not boys or girls. It does not refer to the sex (which is defined by the chromosomes) but to the gender. Maybe you suspected that I'm somewhere inside the LGBTI+ acronym (by the way, I'm also bisexual. But that's another thing!). I don't expect you to understand that immediately... it was difficult for me too!
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a new thing for me. I have already said in the beginning that I have been thinking how to tell you for a long time, how to ""come out"". You don't just wake up someday and decide to be non-binary. I don't know why I'm like this, but whatever reasons are there, that's how I am! I discovered the non-binary label approximately one year and a half ago, but I have older memories of me feeling some king of ""rejection"" towards the word ""boy"" when it was meant to represent me. And I asked to myself for a long time the famous question: ""Who am I""? For some time, I considered the possibility of being a trans girl, but I dismissed it. So, you know. Non-binary was what was left once I saw that I was neither a boy nor a girl.
&gt; 
&gt; The word ""non-binary"" falls under the ""transgender"" umbrella term, because a trans person is somebody with a gender identity that is differemt from the assigned gender at birth. Now that you read this word, you might want to ask me whether I plan on transtitioning, that is, undergoing all this hormones and sex reassignment surgery stuff. The answer is no. It's true that it would be cool to have a less masculine appearence (although not more feminine), but my current body is not *that* annoying.
&gt; 
&gt; I ask you a single thing: avoid all expressions that could imply that I'm a boy (or a girl) when you talk about me. This really annoys me. Try to use a neutral language. I don't have a problem with my current pronouns (""Ell"" is ok in Catalan. In English I prefer singular ""they"", though), but I'm talking about other expressions that include words such as boy, man, guy and similars. I know that it's difficult in a language like Catalan, where the grammatical gender is so important, but I will be very happy if you make the effort.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry I've been hiding it all this time; I don't like hiding stuff from you. I'm kind of afraid of your reaction, specially when we meet again in person, because I have no idea about what could it be. I hope it's a good reaction.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, so that's the surprise of the week! Kisses and hugs for all of you :)

Essentially, a few months back she told me that she had been feeling ""pretty gay"" recently, and that she really wanted to have sex with a female friend of hers. A few months before that, she had given me permission to have sex with anyone (we were long distance, as i was away for school) as long as it was purely a physical relationship. I never took the offer out of fear of falling for anyone else.

Anyway, back to a few months ago when she wanted to have sex with said girl, I agreed pretty much because I felt if she never had this experience she would regret it forever, as we had been dating for nearly 3 years at that point. So, it happened and she was ecstatic and everything seemed good, until she told me ""I probably would have broken up with you if you had said no"". So..this took me by surprise. I was very hurt, and i ended up finding out (from her) that her relationship with said girl was different than what i had been led to believe, so much so that they were ""best friends"" without me knowing. Whatever, I was at school so i guess I wouldn't have noticed. But regardless, I asked her to stop having sex with her and she (begrudgingly) agreed. 

Now as for the nonbinary part, this was not revealed to me until about a month after, in which we were still having some tension over the other girl. According to her, this other girl was better at being supportive (I will absolutely admit to initially not being as supportive as i should have been, mostly out of shock and inexperience with being nonbinary as a concept, though I felt like I didn't really have much time to adjust or learn). On top of that, she still hangs out with this other girl all the time, as well, they're best friends. We argue and I, at first, give her an ultimatum: me or her. She couldn't really decide and I realized that maybe an ultimatum might not be the best thing to do, so i tell her to just stop talking about this girl to me, and don't have sex. They can be friends, but nothing else.

Well, that backfired (in hindsight, I should have taken her inability to answer as the answer). That argument happened in august. Fast forward to a few days ago, she comes crying to me on facetime and tells me they never stopped having sex. I'm devastated. But I ask her why, considering we had gotten to the point of genuinely talking about our future together, she did what she did instead of just breaking up with me. Her response was vague: ""You wouldn't understand...I'm trying to find things out for myself"". She told me how much she loves me and how I deserve someone better, whatever. She also tells me that her cheating on me has nothing to do with me doing something wrong or being unfulfilling, which I do not believe.

She was correct for one thing, however: I really don't understand. And that brings me here, because I genuinely want to know what goes through the mind of a someone who is nonbinary, and why such a thing like this would happen. I don't want to talk to my ex, simply due to the pain, but I am still very curious and a bit confused. She did mention that being with this other girl made her realize how much she hates her own breasts. Is being romantically involved with a different gender than your previous relationships help you in your journey in finding who you are? 

TL;DR Girlfriend comes out as nonbinary, cheats on me with a girl, then tells me i wouldnt understand why she did it. Want to know why, because it apparently had nothing to do with me.

By the way, I sincerely apologize if i said anything that might be either offensive or presumptuous, this is all very new to me.

I swear, if it wasn't made of goddamn broom bristles and it didn't have those damned bald spots, I'd try letting it grow and styling it because why the hell not, maybe I could get into it. But it's just too physically uncomfortable.

But evidently I'm not going to take drastic, expensive, potentially face-destroying measures for permanent removal *without even knowing what my face looks like without it.*

I'm starting to feel really tempted to grab my GF's epilator, go through the ordeal of ripping it off my face and finish it with tweezers. Not the first time I think about this either. But this sounds like an obviously horrible idea.

Do I have any alternatives? Is this off-topic?

Based on all of this, it seems like I should just be a trans guy, if being a trans guy is what I\'m comfortable with, but every time I say ""okay, I\'m just gonna be a trans guy then!"", it\'s only a few weeks or months before the thought that I\'m avoiding a part of my self comes back. I\'m not sure if I\'m just confused or internalizing something or what.\n\nHas anyone had any similar experiences?

So, my question is if here's any Spanish speakers (or Portuguese, French, or basically any Latin language) and how do you face the binary gender issue in our language? I'm a Spanish native speaker and I hate how gendered it is, most adjectives and nouns are gendered (in French even some verbs, like when you conjugate in past, like 'je suis allée'), and pronouns, all third person pronouns are gendered (él, ella, ellos, ellas). I'm not non-binary, but I hate always having to make those gender decisions when I speak, on one hand because I could be forcing a gender to someone and make them feel uncomfortable, and also because whenever I have to talk about a group of people I have to use male pronouns, adjectives and nouns, and I feel that I'm leaving out everyone who's non-male (as a woman, I've always felt left out when my teachers said 'todos' instead of 'todos y todas').
About this in Spanish I've seen 3 solutions:
1. Always use the male and female counterparts together, like 'todas y todos', 'compañeras y compañeros', but this does not include non-binary people, it's still gendered.
2. Avoid gendered words and use genderless ones instead, like saying 'estudiantes' instead of 'alumnos' which I try to do as much as I can, and that's the problem, you can't always find a genderless word for what you want to say.
3. When writing, use an 'x' or 'e' instead of the 'o' or 'a', like 'compañerxs', 'todes', etc. When speaking, you can't say 'compañerxs', but you can say 'compañeres', so it's pretty good, but it's still hard to do because our language is too binary (AND SEXIST) and it still doesn't solve the pronoun issue. I guess I could say 'elles' instead of 'ellos/ellas' (although I've actually never heard it, so I don't know if it's a thing), but what do I do when I have to use singular pronouns? What's the genderless version of 'él/ella'? I guess I could just use the person's name, but it bothers me that Spanish lacks genderless pronouns.

So, what are your thoughts on this? I really want to neutralize my language, and I'm trying to get rid of gender when I speak as much as I can, but I still have a lot of situations where I have no idea on how to do it, especially because I haven't seen so much discussion about this in Spanish as I've seen in English (and we really need to talk more about this!).",NonBinary,About genderless use of language in Latin languages,1510004684.0,"{'created_utc': 1509979484, 'id': '7b5jmh', 'num_comments': 21, 'score': 26, 'selftext': ""Hello!

(r/mtf post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/7bajhz/can_one_somewhat_feminize_genderneutralize_the/ )

TL;DR = (title of post) or: If I have to wear the standard 'male' formal color combo amid 'other men', across from some women wearing all black, is there some way i can retain (with my outfit) some subtle degree of my gender presentation without breaking the color pattern?



I am a male to feminine nonbinary person or ""demigirl"". I am still in the process of coming out to people, and in figuring out my presentation. I'm only like ~5-10% at most maybe so far into properly discovering my voice still. There are some obvious feminine things I do like paint my nails and wear make-up and women's sweaters etc, but at the moment I am basically read as male.


I'm doing music in school. Of my current 3 main teachers, I'm out to 1 of them, no, 2 now, as of today. 1 was my primary singing teacher. Number 2, today, was the teacher of a chamber choir I sing in.


So as I mentioned, I sing in a chamber choir, something like ~16 people. SATB (soprano alto tenor bass). We sing arranged in a horseshoe pattern arranged from lowest parts to highest parts. I'm in the tenor 2 section maybe 3 ""guys"" out from the middle, opposite the girls.. Anyway.


We have a performance coming up next week.


""Ladies, all black. Men, you know the drill. Black slacks, white shirt, black bowtie.""


I asked after class if I could wear all black. He said if I had a reason for it he'd hear me out. So I nervously came out to him and told him why. But I also considered the situation a bit, out loud, when talking with him. That the break in the color pattern could draw attention that I'm not necessarily seeking. That I imagined it probably wouldn't be possible to re-position me to the end of the tenors, in the middle, to avoid this visual pattern break (he confirmed this, I mustn't leave my designated position). But he was still willing to let me wear all black if I decided I wanted to, given my reason. Told me to think about it.


Upon starting to think about it, my mind went here:


Is there a way I can wear the same color pallette as the men surrounding me, but just sort of subtly make my outfit a bit more feminine? Maybe if there's a female equivalent of that outfit... Differently fitting pants and shirt, maybe some kinda black ribbony thing instead of a bowtie..? I don't know..


(I don't know how far I'd want to take it, but it did also just occur to me that I do also own a nice black skirt that goes past the knee. Maybe if I knew just what else to wear with that, that matches the guy color pallette..? Hmm, would black leggings make sense perhaps in that situation also to possibly reduce the ""distraction"" level? To be honest I have not yet really figured out how color combinations and everything works in girl mode fashion yet.. Maybe I'm just being extra careful.. I feel like the ""boymode"" or ""nonbinary"" outfits I randomly throw together everyday are very well color combo'd... I'm rambling...)

I'm now perceived as the gender that I feel more like, but I don't actually feel more understood.

61,2017-11-10 19:15:52,7c3a17,1,3,"So, hi. I’m new here. Wanted a place to vent about stuff that’s been going on in my head recently, and was wondering if other people have ever felt the same. 

I’ve recently started to be more open about my nonbinary identity, and have started to accept it more and start to explore it a bit. I started feeling like I wasn’t cis about 6 years ago but mostly kept it to myself and felt very ashamed of it in that time, which I think is part of the reason I find it so hard to talk about now. 

I came out a few months ago to a select group of close friends, and to my partner. The support I received was amazing and I felt great, for the first time I actually felt validated and accepted. I also joined a lot of nonbinary facebook groups on a fake account so people I’m not out to yet didn’t see, and got talking to a lot of lovely strangers. 

The problem is, starting to accept myself and talk about my identity seems to have brought me a whole load of different problems from the ones I had when I was hiding it. Now I’ve started coming out, I just want to come out to everyone and start my transition, but 1) I don’t feel safe coming out to a lot of people, 2) my anxiety is preventing me from coming out to people I would feel safe with, 3) I’m feeling increasingly depressed that I can’t transition immediately/can’t transition in the way I want to. My dysphoria has got far worse, and I just keep thinking about how angry and miserable I am that my gender isn’t legally recognised. I live in the UK, and our government is currently discussing reforming the gender recognition act from 2004 to make it easier for binary trans people to legally change their genders, but there’s no mention of whether it will include changes for nonbinary people too. 

I don’t know if I want to go on hormones, I kinda want top surgery, I definitely 100% at least want a reduction, but the doctors will likely refuse to give me a reduction because of my weight so that’s another thing I have to wait for. I was thinking about asking to be referred to a gender identity clinic, but I’m not sure how much help it’d be when I’m unsure of what I want to do when it comes to transitioning, and also I’m scared my doctor would just laugh at me and tell me I’m not trans. Transitioning physically also concerns me because my boyfriend is cis and straight so I wonder how he’d feel about it, although he’s been really supportive so far. 

I’m also worried about how I’m ever going to come out to my family. I live with them at the moment and it’s difficult constantly being misgendered. My sister sort of knows that I’m not cis but she’s made her opinions on nonbinary people very clear (“stupid tumblr snowflakes wanting to feel special/following a trend” “they/them are grammatically incorrect pronouns” “you have a vagina so you’re female” etc etc). So she doesn’t use my pronouns or acknowledge me as nonbinary. My mum is worse, she constantly uses slurs when referring to trans people, she once refused to let me go stay at a friend’s house who was a trans girl because “I don’t want you getting involved in any weird tranny sex parties”. She also tends to take the attitude of “I’ll do what I want whether you like it or not”, I’ve asked her repeatedly to please call me Abi or the nickname my sister and brother call me instead of Abigail, but she refuses and still calls me Abigail. I was thinking about potentially coming out to my family after I move out, although I’m not sure when that’ll be. I’m 20 but can’t work at the moment because of my mental health issues, so don’t have the money to move out. 

I’m just kinda finding life in general really hard and really really wishing I could just be cis at the moment. I’ve thought about just trying to fake it like I used to and seeing if I can get by pretending to be a girl because it’d make life so much easier if I could. I’m angry and frustrated at the world and feel like I’m just helpless while people in positions of power debate whether I should legally be allowed to exist, while strangers laugh at my pronouns and identity, while my family talk about how trans people are attention seeking, confused or perverts. It just makes me want to isolate myself and never have to face another person again. 

Anyway, thanks for reading whatever this mess of thoughts and feelings is.

It just makes me want to isolate myself and never have to face another person again. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading whatever this mess of thoughts and feelings is.

But lately, I've been noticing musings toward nonbinary thoughts and stuff, below is two tumblr posts I wrote, kinda stream of consciousness stuff. I would like anyone's thoughts on these musings, sorry it's so long and all over the place.

And I apologise if I've worded anything wrong or used the wrong terms or something, I've only ever heard any of the terms and notions in passing. So if I say something wrong I am sorry.


&gt; Last night I was reflecting on my admiration for non binary folk, particularly femme and trans femme non binarys. I came to realisation that maybe I'm not just jealous of their styles and presentations, I’m actually envious of their gender.
&gt;
&gt; Well that led to some self reflective soul searching. Am I non binary to some extent? I never came to any sort of answer. I do identify with female as a gender, which is pretty binary, but I also sometimes don’t? It’s not like I ever identify with male, or agender or something along those lines. But I read a brief questionnaire that asked if my gender fluctuated between different intensities whilst staying the same relative identity, and I’d never thought of it before but yeah it kinda does. That’s something like genderflux? So that would make me femme flux? Demigirl? Transfeminine flux? I dunno what even.
&gt; 
&gt; Gender is complicated. Or it isn’t. Gee I don’t know anything anymore.

.

&gt; Further to the non binary musings. I’ve also felt disappointed that I am binary (am I though?) and that I was letting someone down. I’ve never really vocalised that to anyone though, because binary identities are valid, and I’m not letting anyone down. But I still feel it.
&gt;
&gt; When filling out forms that ask for gender if there’s only male or female I will always, without hesitation, choose female. But if there’s a greater selection, like for example MtF, FtM, Male, Female, Non Binary. I will hesitate between choosing MtF or Female, like I don’t want to recognise my AMAB past, but Female isn’t completely accurate either. Or if they ask are you a man or a woman, I know I’m not a man, but I also hesitate on woman. How can I be female but not a woman?
&gt;
&gt; I have often brushed these thoughts aside, nah if I were non binary I’d know, I’d identify with the label more. I’d not feel female. I am binary I’d tell myself, feeling that disappointment at the back of mind. Like, I know, but what if…
&gt;
&gt; I mean, these are similar feelings I felt before transitioning, to convince myself not to. Not as strong or as well defined, but similar nonetheless.
&gt;
&gt; But what does it mean? There are so many labels and names and identities it’s confusing and I don’t find any particularly alluring. I wouldn’t even know where to begin if I were non binary.
&gt;
&gt; I’ve always celebrated non binary people and their identities and fought for their inclusion into trans communities, is it just because I feel that inclusion and diversity is superior to exclusion, or is there more?
&gt;
&gt; I’ve always known and celebrated that gender binary construct is an artifice of what is really a spectrum, probably not even a one dimensional spectrum (ie: sliding from one side to another) at that. So why do I feel, if I feel disappointment in being binary not allow myself the freedom of such a spectrum? Is it societal? Is it my own low self worth in play here, only allowing me so much freedom but no more?
&gt;

I have been out as male for more than one year and have only started with the Gender Clinic. 
After being out as male I start to discover much more to my gender identity and who I am, what causes my dysphoria, what I'm able to handle, etc. 
Long story short, I have always wanted to have a child of my own. They've given me the option to freeze my eggs, but the procedure freaks me out I can't stomach it... I really can't... it leaves me lightheaded, and it just doesn't feel right anyone... well... I can't... 

I have done some research on fertility and hormones. Obviously I will never be able to tell how much of my fertility starting male hormones can affect, but I've heard of cases where people have taken themselves off T and have successfully resumed ovulation. 

I'm wanting to give it a go, because if it's possible then I would rather carry than freeze my eggs, which I really cannot bring myself to do as the thought causes me emotional distress. I can't even see a gynaecologist for the same reasons. I'm okay with my original plumbing and prefer it sexually. But the... checkups and surgeries... I can't do it. 

This aside. Is anyone with the NHS? Do the NHS supply you with hormones? If so, how will I be able to freely take myself off hormones temporarily to try and conceive without the NHS denying me treatment? I know they will, they only care about the money after all, but the idea of being unable to conceive will emotionally shatter me. 

Already I'm feeling suicidal thinking of this. The NHS and never being on hormones again all because I wanted to have a baby.. it f*cking hurts. I'm not sure if anyone here is wanting something similar, or is deciding to go off T for other personal reasons. Does anyone know what I could possibly do? What are my options? Is it possible to take myself off them over an agreement and be able to resume treatment when necessary? 

I don't want to force myself to stay on T and destroy my chances of being fertile enough to carry a child of my own. I was thinking of taking hormones until my voice deepens, my shoulders broaden and certain areas grow a little. Taking it long enough to separate myself from my biology. Hopefully resume ovulation and take supplements to support this. Clearly I'm going to need something in order to prevent vaginal atrophy. I've heard somewhere about being supplied with a small dose of E just to keep certain areas healthy?? 

You can tell me if I'm wrong. I'm not that bright and still have plenty to learn. I just hope this text post can be free from any negative judgement, just for today, because right now I feel like sh*t. Right now I'm feeling like sh*t and honestly my head is in a dark place. Normally I can handle constructive criticism, but right now... it's really hard, I can't even concentrate on my studies right now. Honestly, I can't concentrate on anything. 

Taking hormones, being with the NHS... I'm so scared of things going terribly. I don't want to lose the chance of carrying a child, and I don't want to be denied hormones afterwards as I might not be able to handle any further dysphoria. 

Yes, pregnancy. Most pregnancy is seen in females. Ha. My dad commented on this today. ""Pregnancy is a women's thing, why do you want to be pregnant!?"" 

Embarrassing, I know. Yet I'm not going to share this with the entire planet, am I. I've heard of plenty of AFAB people going through pregnancy, if there's a slim chance I am able to still conceive than I would rather take it than throw it away because some stupid NHS regulations. Check boxes. Etc. 

I'm in the nonbinary form as although I'm in the process of starting male hormones, I don't feel entirely like a binary male.

Both Tinder and OKCupid allow you to list your gender as something other than male or female. However, both still require you to decide if you'd rather be included in searches for men or women. I don't really understand why they can't have a third category for people who'd rather not be included as either of those, but whatever.

If you use those sites/apps, how do you decide if you'd rather show up in searches as a man or a woman? Do you go by your own comfort level/self-identification? Which gender you typically pass as? Your transition goals (if any)?

I feel like letting myself be listed as a woman is probably the lowest-pressure option right now. I'm AFAB and haven't transitioned except for coming out as non-binary. I'm undecided about medical transition. I like the idea of having a male body, but I don't really mind how my body is right now for the most part. But I do see myself as more of a guy than a woman, and when I try to navigate online dating, I'm very self-conscious about how people see me. I worry about people seeing my profile come up in a search for women and deciding that, regardless of what my profile says, I'm basically a woman. But calling myself a man feels like a lot of pressure when realistically, I know that most people who are looking for male partners probably won't find me attractive in that way.

Has anyone had any experience with this particular clinic or anything similar?

I'm looking into other minor, non-trans specific tweaks (laser, fillers), but that's that. I'm already presenting as female and I'm pretty comfortable with that.

I've been dating bi/pan guys mostly, 1-2 on the Kinsey scale. I've previously presented as male, and had one boyfriend during that period, and then had one other, while presenting female, and currently I have one. 

With my current boyfriend, we're in a long-distance relationship, he used to live in an other part of the country, now he's just moved to an other city in an other country. I helped him in getting a job, I also plan to move together with him later and it isn't further away than his previous town. We used to be together once a month for 2-5 days, now this could increase as he won't have his homophobic parents around, which prevented me from visiting him. This is my first relationship where we're both in love and I feel that I can have emotional intimacy with an other person.

He's dealing with depression and I'm dealing with anxiety, we're both taking medications for that. Unfortunately, his medications are decreasing his already lower sex drive, while mine is up to the skies - during our last meeting, which lasted 5 days, we had sex twice, both of the times when he initiated, but I was also initiating sex like 2 times a day besides that. We've had issues with me being pushy, he even said that he was afraid that something would ""break"" and I would try to ""coerce him"". He later clarified it was more of a fantasy for him, obviously under consensual terms. I haven't had issues like this with other boyfriends, my sex drive was way lower back then and also those weren't long-distance relationships, so we could meet up reasonably frequently. I fully take responsibility for my wrongs in this situations, obviously I understand where I have been wrong and I plan on actively changing it.

He's been asking about hormone therapy three times, whether I'm contemplating doing it. On the last occasion, I eventually made him admit that he's ""missing tits"". He later clarified, that I shouldn't take it too seriously and that he's in love with me, but obviously it triggered my disphoria and I can't really let go of the whole thing, it has been giving me massive anxiety for the last 3 days, up to the point where I can't properly function at work or in social settings. We've discussed it since then, but him reasserting that he loves me and won't leave me doesn't quite work. I don't know any other trans/non-binary people and obviously discussing it with my cis friends doesn't really work. We had issues with him constantly flirting with cis girls in a really creepy way online, which he actually worked on and managed to stop with. 

I'm afraid if I'm shutting down similar conversations I'm forcing him to be polite and not discuss important things, however discussing it freely will obviously deteriorate my mental health.

I am a bit drunk (can't seem to post these kind of topics while sober), so I apologize if this post is somewhat incoherent and rambly.

I was raised by parents who stoutly reject gender norms. I had both ""boy toys"" and ""girl toys"" growing up. For example, I was interested in both dressing up and taking apart computer keyboards as a child, and my parents encouraged both activities. 

My mother is very interested in redefining womanhood to fall outside gender stereotypes. Dad would like manhood to fall outside gender stereotypes as well, but he's more of an activist for redefining womanhood. I suspect he believes that once one gender has broken the norms, the other one will naturally follow. Neither of my parents fit gender norms at all, but they are both cis. They also both believe it is important for cis people to reject gender stereotypes as part of the overall goal of eliminating sexism and patriarchy. Growing up, I pretty much considered myself a non-typical girl. Any outside of gender norms activities I partook in were “see, girls can do this too.” But my identity as a girl was based on nothing more than my XX chromosomes. 

I remember looking forward to getting my period because that would be a mark of entering adulthood. When it finally came though, it felt wrong. I’m not sure how else to put that. I’m not sure if this is more of a dysphoria or a “lots of women hate their period” thing. 

When I was about 19, I first encountered the term (and concept) genderless. My immediate thought was “OMG, that’s me.” I was part of an asexuality website that asked users to list their pronouns. I put zhe/zir because my hyper-active grammatical brain couldn’t accept singular they. Seeing myself referred to as zhe/zir just felt right. On the other hand, seeing myself referred to as he/him online also feels right, but I know I’m not a transman. 

I’m not really interested in surgery or hormones to bring myself closer to the nonbinary region. I don’t want my boobs reduced because my hips are super-wide, and the two balance each other out pretty well. I don’t want to cut my hair short because my face looks better with long hair (and I like playing with my hair). I wear mostly women’s clothing because it fits my physique better. I curse my body for being hyper-feminine, but I make no attempt to change that. I’m not super interested in actively trying to change it either. 

Part of me suspects that my parents are both genderless/nonbinary as well. Within their time-period, they coped best by embracing the feminism movement with its ideals of breaking down gender norms and binaries. Should I do the same? 

Where is the line between a genderless person and a woman who is actively trying to reject the patriarchy every day of her/zir life?

127,2017-11-19 22:15:21,7e3z46,3,17,"Thank you to anyone reading. I'm wondering if others have thoughts or similarities on how I’m experiencing gender. I'm struggling with words and terms a bit and hope this is ok to ask for some help with. 

I’m attracted to the term “nonbinary” as I’m pretty sure I don’t think there is much distinction of value or meaning in “male” and “female” and this these are both inadequate, oversimplifying, and similar enough to be kind of irrelevant (for me).  I also reject the idea that gender always exists in relation  (inclusive, alternating, etc. ) to these two concepts. ""Genderqueer"" seems like it has angles of making sense here too. 

I was assigned male and birth and have always felt like that made enough sense. I've never felt female and despite debilitating body image challenges, have always felt like having an external appearance labeled male was close enough. 

I’m not feeling a need or interest in changing my body, etc. I'm in a relationship with another AMAB person for the past 20 years and usually identify as queer, but sometimes gay.

But in so many ways, I don’t recognize myself as  “male.” I don't feel connected to other men through a gender lens, don't feel at all like I am part of the conversation when people talk about men*, and have never been interested in gendered spaces or activities for men. I’ve rarely felt men see me as one of them either. This includes gay/queer men as well.  I’ve even noticed in my closest peer group that the “men” connect with each other and are referred to as “the guys,” etc. This never includes me. It’s just understood that this is not me. 

At this point – it’s like I look male, I have male-male seeming romantic and sexual relationships, but I’m otherwise not male internally. 

I remember bristling in childhood when a peer called me ""dude,"" couldn’t understand why boys and girls had different clothes, shirts on or off when swimming, and frequently have to remind myself that I am male when people are speaking about men. I don't feel comfortable being called ""sir.""  Many of the stories I read and a few of the folks I know have similar dissonance with these things, but I see them express a connection to or an identity reflecting “femaleness”. 

*I think one of the complicating factors is that I believe that male and female are political and social groupings and that my expression of maleness (especially my appearance)  has brought various unearned privileges including forms of safety, being listened to, employment privileges, and more.

Is this non-binary? A form of gender ambivalence?  Ami Just a a male that doesn’t relate to maleness on many levels?  

Thank you for any thoughts.

I have worn my hair long (for a boy/man) for nearly my entire life - not as a statement of my gender identity but because that's how I like my hair - and I was never really bothered when I was occasionally misgendered as a prepubescent/young teen. I would occasionally through middle and high school sketch myself as a girl, and sometimes used female avatars on forum websites. Even before I became more educated about gender and sexuality - and questioned my own - I always recognized that a part of me wanted to be more feminine (or something). 

When I got to college I was fortunate to have a very supportive social network that allowed me to experiment and I had a number of experiences that pushed me to question my sexuality and how I related to other people, discovering first that I am bisexual and then that I am polyamorous and - unsurprisingly - that I enjoy cross dressing, though not necessarily out of a sexual impulse but because I felt comfortable in clothes that are typically reserved for women. At every turn I felt comfortable and fulfillment in transgressing norms relating to gender and sex. 

I started reading about sex and gender through queer feminist theory and began to understand why I felt so claustrophobic in the masculine identity that had been pushed on me. I knew that I was not ""male"" but wasn't sure where that left me - agender, genderqueer, nonbinary, bigender - all of these felt more comfortable to me than being male, but where I fit exactly I wasn't quite sure. With no strong feelings one way or another I had a ""soft"" settle on being nonbinary. 

Presently I'm in a relationship with two wonderful partners, a woman that I'm engaged to whom I've been with for sixish years and an AFAB enby who has been part of our lives for the past year and a half. My interactions with my enby partner - as well as a few of my friends transitioning - has renewed my self reflection on my identity. Talking with them about their identity has made me feel more certain that I'm nonbinary, but as they have openly mused about transitioning to present more as such, I've been left uncertain of what to do. 

I guess ideally I would rather have a vagina though the idea of surgery is terrifying and something I prefer not to think about. In an ideal world I would have been born with one and would have come to my enby identity and would just take some T and change my dress to being more androgynous/butch. But that's not the world we live in. 

Transitioning feels so permanent and I'm not sure that I feel strongly enough about my gender identity and genitalia enough - in either way - to want to go through it. However, as I alluded to previously, I *really* dislike masculinity and the expectation that I perform it. 

Obviously everyone's gender identity is their own so nobody can tell me what I should do per se. I'm just feeling a bit more dysphoric than normal at the moment and I just wanted to get that all off my chest a little.

I'm AFAB and my birth name is EXTREMELY feminine. Fortunately, I've been going by a gender neutral nickname since I was 14. (I didn't accept my nonbinaryness until I was 23, so the fact that my nickname is gender neutral is a happy coincidence.) I use this nickname so commonly that I have dozens of friends who legitimately do not know what my legal first name is.

For most of the time I've had my Facebook, I've had my name set up as ""[First name] [Nickname] [Last name.]"" My family still calls me by my birth name, so this seemed like an easy way for both my friends and family to be able to find me. However, as time went on and I started going by my birth name less and less frequently, this started to bother me more and more, especially when Facebook would shorten it and refer to me by just my birth name rather than the full thing. I only use my birth name intentionally when I'm trying to be professional, (my nickname doesn't sound like a real name), so I've come to think of my nickname as who I really am and my birth name as more of a tool I use or an act I put on.

About 10 months ago, I publicly came out as genderqueer, and this seemed like as good of an excuse as any to no longer have to deal with seeing my birth name on social media. Not only did I feel super disconnected from it anyway, but also the hyper femininity of it was really dysphoria triggering, so being able to use my personal Facebook account as ""[Nickname] [Last name]"" was incredibly freeing. I still had ""[First name] [Last name]"" in parenthesis on my profile, labeled as my birth name, in case family or anyone else who met me before age 14 wanted to find me, but having my nickname as my first name around the rest of Facebook was a massive weight off my chest.

5 days ago, this all came crashing down. Facebook deactivated my account and demanded documentation to prove that [Nickname] [Last name] is in fact ""the name I use in every day life.""

The problem is, Facebook has a list of all the types of documentation they'll accept, and pretty much all of it is either stuff that I don't have (magazine subscription, membership card, etc.) or stuff that has my birth name on it (driver's license, birth certificate, etc.) I have TONS of stuff I've accumulated over the years with my nickname on it, and I've tried submitting some of it, but since none of it is on their list, they won't accept it. I also tried sending a message explaining the situation, but all I got was an obviously copy/pasted reply that didn't address my concerns at all.

I'm so fucking upset over this. More upset than I want to admit. I know it sounds dumb since it's just Facebook, but I've had that account since I was like 16 or 17 years old. I'm 26 now, so that's around a decade's worth of memories that I'm losing. I feel like someone confiscated my diary or scrapbook or something. Not to mention all of my friends whose phone numbers I don't have and Facebook is how we communicate, and I'm scared to death that I'm going to lose them. I'm also worried about my family hunting down my Twitter or Tumblr if they can't stalk me over Facebook, and I did NOT make those profiles safe for my family to look at.

My roommate is making matters worse too because she has the ability to help me fix it, but won't. We talked a few weeks ago about adding me to her CostCo account and getting me my own card, so I brought it up again knowing that I could probably have a CostCo card under my nickname and Facebook would probably accept it. However, not only does she completely not see my situation as a problem at all, but she also has severe social anxiety and wants to avoid big shopping centers like CostCo now that Christmas shopping season has started. I don't want to bring it up again and be that asshole who's dismissive of mental illness, especially over something that she doesn't even see as a problem, but I also am incredibly annoyed by the prospect of signing up for my own CostCo account because it seems so stupid to spend $60 basically just to get my Facebook profile back.

People keep telling me to just put in the documentation for my legal name and switch back to my nickname as soon as my account is reactivated, but I'm scared that Facebook won't let me switch again without more documentation, and I'd rather be without Facebook for a short time than get my dysphoria triggered every time I log on. I know this isn't Facebook's intention, but the way they're trying to force my birth name on me feels like they're trying to force womanhood on me, so this entire ordeal has had dysphoria kicking my ass enough as it is. And it's SO DAMN FRUSTRATING because I did in fact have my legal name on my profile, so it wasn't like I was trying to be sneaky and conceal my identity or whatever. I just don't want that super feminine name to be the one I have to look at EVERY SINGLE SECOND I'm using my primary social network!

This is my first post ever on reddit, so yeah, please don't be too rough with me (how do I again change these gray box-thingies (sometimes they read 'rant' and other stuff) on mobile?) ^^'
I've kind of felt disconnected from any gender for a few years now. I know that basing the following stuff on this might not correct, but anyway. I've stumbled upon the lovely term of 'non-binary' a few days ago, and it kind of feels like I've found an answer to a question that's been stuck inside of me for a long time. I've recently ordered binders and am already bursting with a kind of pleasant anticipation. 
Now, here comes the hard part: I've so far only told one person that I'm really close with that I identify as non-binary. I know that most the people I am surrounded with are rather narrow-minded and not really accepting/tolerant for that part (I'm ace for a long time, but my parents for example still kind of mock me ('You just haven't found the right girl', 'You've never had sex how would you know?!', you know, that stuff) and only like 3 people have no issues whatsoever with 'a guy' (notice the inverted commas) not being into having sex with anybody. 
So, this begs the question: Should I really come out to my environment as enby (I should probably choose a new nickname for that too [I really like Dakota], but how do I get people to actually use that correctly (/instead of my 'original name') since most of them don't accept me for the person I am?) or should I just wait until university to do that (and have a sort of a fresh start?)

I'm not sure if contraindicated means someone who is medically unable to take the hormones, or someone who the doctor recommends don't need them, because well the patient doesn't want a beard and a deep voice... 

The information and guidelines that exist seem so geared towards binary trans people (and I mean, understandably so), but it makes it hard for me to even have an idea as to whether or not my transition goals are even worth emotionally investing in. 

Furthermore, I'm pretty sure a breast reduction would not be covered at all. Mastectomies seem to be, but I don't want them gone completely, just reduced to like an A cup. 

Any incite would be nice! Thanks

Everyone who I've come out to has been extremely supportive and caring to me. Even people who I didn't expect to be supportive. I've been doing pretty well and have been feeling much happier about it, but as more time goes on I've begun to notice my dysphoria is just getting worse and worse.

At first I was happy with what I saw in the mirror. Now I look in the mirror and just see a man. I hate my face which is moderately masculine, I really hate my deep voice. My voice especially, I feel like it's what instantly gives me away. What's worse is that I switch into a deeper voice when I'm uncomfortable rather than my higher, happy voice. When I open my mouth, strangers give me kind of a shocked look because (at least I'm guessing) at first glance they may not think I'm a guy. Or maybe they do, that's what I see when I look in the mirror still.

I mean at least I'm able to hide my 5 o'clock shadow thanks to some excellent makeup, but I'm just struggling right now. I keep thinking what if I'm just a cis guy and all of this is a mistake? I still look like a guy apparently. Why even bother if I never am going to have a chance of passing anyway? Why put myself through all of the weird, uncomfortable looks and the silent judging? I just feel like I want to go back in the closet and stop even bothering with all of this.

And more and more I think about it I want HRT, but I know it isn't really an option for me. Unfortunately it has effects on one of the only parts of my body I enjoy and am happy with (my genitals, reduced use and size of them is something that I seriously do not want) and I don't really want my sex drive to change. So I'm just stuck trying to figure out whether I want to leave my genitals unaffected or if I want a better body and I can't choose because I want both. So I'm just stuck a dyshporic mess.

Does anyone have any advice they could give me? Like anything, on voice training, appearance, my HRT woes, or my dysphoria. I am just starting to really feel the struggle.

Granted they were more feminine presenting and AFAB and I know that’s not everyone’s experience and I don’t have any real way to know how they identified but aesthetically something about not being a woman or a man and having an AFAB body just makes me frenzied thinking about.

One of my best memories from when I was little was one day when I was in a field trip. I was wearing a guy's shirt (I was born female) and I kept looking down at it. It was the best day of my life. If I had any brothers, I may have crossdressed. Muy childhood was pretty normal, but when I turned 8, things got a bit weird. something about my gender felt.. *off*. didn't feel female, but not quite male either. This still continues today. 

Things got a bit more odd when I got to middle school. I felt like my breasts were too large, and I would wear jackets everywhere. It could be 100 degrees outside, and I'd still wear a jacket. I found myself staring at the boys section in stores (and the guys at my school) and wishing I could wear them, and fantasize about how they would look uninterrupted by breasts (sorry if I sound a bit sexist). I loved the slim, straight waist and narrow hips. It became the subject of many fantasies. I began to look up stories where a female character either dresses as a guy or (agh, this is gonna sound weird) becomes a guy. 
The dysphoria didn't happen too often, but when it did it sucked. I would look at my breasts and feel physically sick.
 I got a haircut last year and that was a step forward. Not a buzzcut, just a kind of pixie cut (like Haruhi from OHSHC). 

A few days I looked in the mirror and my jacket kinda covered my chest and my hair looked kind of like a greaser's. My mood went up immediately.

So here goes.. 

I'm a 26 y/o female from the Philippines who is in a 5 yr (turning 6 on Feb) relationship with a transman   who is also from the Philippines. I came from a quite religious old traditioned  and conservative family because my parents grew up in the province. When I was in my teenage years, I started dating boys but my parents were against it. In the Philippines, parents can be very strict. When I was in my last year in college i met a lesbian who is now my boyfriend (currently transitioning to transman) To be honest I never imagined myself being in a same sex relationship. I was all about boys then. I didn't enter this relationship because I got my heart broken with by guy, no. It just felt right. My parents knew about it and they got mad with the cursing and all and it just hurts so bad that they judge the person just because he's a transman. They are so disgusted they have so many comments about it! They are really against this whole same sex relationship because they say nothing good comes out of it. That I am destroying my future because I am inlove with him. (For the record they don't know the different between lesbians and trans) That God didn't make gays and lesbians only man and woman and all that shit that homophobic people say. So from then on I just told them we broke up just to shut them up, so no more issues. Then I moved out of the country with my boyfriend. 

Fast forward to 5 yrs, we are happily living together BUT still without the knowledge of my parents. I have been keeping it from them for years because I wanted to protect him from all the hurtful words my parents will say to him. My relationship with my boyfriend has matured that now we are thinking of a future, our own family together. It has been bothering me for days if now is the right time to tell them everything. Of course I am so scared of what might happen after. And i am pretty much sure they would want me to choose: them or my boyfriend. I never wanted that to happen because he is my family now, 

What do I have to do for them to accept me? Us? I wanted to prove to them that he has never put me in any danger and that my future with him is as bright as sunshine. Because i think for them having my own children and having their own grand children is like the greatest achievement. Ok I want that too but with him, and when I am totally ready. I have found my soulmate, the love of my life but why do i feel like my own parents want me to be unhappy and be with someone that I don't love. I don't know anymore.

I've previously called this ""indirect gender dysphoria"". This is a dissociative symptom that's difficult to describe, but it's linked to significant mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Depersonalization may also be up to 18 times more common in trans people - frequent enough that it may be considered an understudied aspect of the experience of gender dysphoria. See more about this research here: https://genderanalysis.net/depersonalization/

In my discussions with psychiatrists who specialize in neurochemistry, we've found that depersonalization symptoms are likely linked to the NMDA receptor and are often treated experimentally with Lamictal (which is also used to counteract the dissociative NMDA antagonist drug ketamine), with some promising results. Estrogen also appears to act on NMDA and seems a likely candidate for the neurochemical basis of the marked and rapid effect of HRT on mitigating dissociative symptoms. If this is the case, then we would have reason to investigate the possibility that Lamictal could serve as an add-on treatment to HRT when significant mental health difficulties are still present.

25,2017-11-06 11:22:55,7b4jh2,2,5,"Hi guys

This is my first ever post on Reddit

My fiance is secretly a MtF transgendered woman. She doesn't feel comfortable coming out of the closet because 

1) her field of work is a male dominated field that is difficult to get into as it is

2) she's afraid of being discriminated against and unaccepted by the people she loves (I.e. friends and family)

3) She has a hard time managing her mental health now as a man and feels like coming out would crush her spirit (she would lose many of her supports, both family and friends.... conservative family, conservative field of work) and she is self conscious/socially anxious already without being treated differently based on her appearance

Right now she crossdresses in the evenings and on the weekends. I help her with her make up and outfits and nails. We've bought wigs and padding and shoes and sex toys to help her feel as womanly as possible when we have the opportunity to let her be herself. It can be hard because we have tenants that share our property.

She's gone online to try and find friends who might accept her as her real self but a lot of people online see her solely as a cross dresser and treat her like she's a fetish or a sex doll. What she really wants are friends who understand her and support her and will keep her secret 

It can be hard here in the LGBTQ community because it is such a small place... once one person joins the community is spreads like wildfire. She wants to keep things under wraps. Also because she is publically identifying as a man, some people view her situation with skepticism. 

I guess what I'm wondering is how best to support her? I know she would love to transition but feels like she can't. It's her choice what she wants to do and I accept that and support her regardless. But I would love for her to be able to make friends and talk about what she's going through and feel normal.

Are there any sites where Mia could feel supported and make a connection with people who are going through a similar situation? I really want her to be happy and I think having a connection with a community that understands her would really help.

Thanks for reading

She doesn't feel comfortable coming out of the closet because \n\n1) her field of work is a male dominated field that is difficult to get into as it is\n\n2) she's afraid of being discriminated against and unaccepted by the people she loves (I.e. friends and family)\n\n3) She has a hard time managing her mental health now as a man and feels like coming out would crush her spirit (she would lose many of her supports, both family and friends.... conservative family, conservative field of work) and she is self conscious/socially anxious already without being treated differently based on her appearance\n\nRight now she crossdresses in the evenings and on the weekends. I help her with her make up and outfits and nails. We've bought wigs and padding and shoes and sex toys to help her feel as womanly as possible when we have the opportunity to let her be herself. It can be hard because we have tenants that share our property.\n\nShe's gone online to try and find friends who might accept her as her real self but a lot of people online see her solely as a cross dresser and treat her like she's a fetish or a sex doll. What she really wants are friends who understand her and support her and will keep her secret \n\nIt can be hard here in the LGBTQ community because it is such a small place... once one person joins the community is spreads like wildfire. She wants to keep things under wraps. Also because she is publically identifying as a man, some people view her situation with skepticism. \n\nI guess what I'm wondering is how best to support her?

I come from a pretty conservative family, so I got very used to blocking out feelings that would be inconvenient for me to have at a young age. That's why I've only been able to admit to my bisexuality a year ago. But once I admitted that, some other feelings started to come up. I started looking in the mirror and wishing my hips were wider, I started getting increasingly annoyed at my body hair, my coarse skin, my wide shoulders. If I ever let myself grow facial hair, I get very depressed. I am extremely conscious of my vocal inflection, how low my voice is, how big my hands and feet are, how giant my Adam's apple is. I started looking up ways to dress and exercise to make my shoulders look thinner and my hips look wider, I shave pretty much my entire body except my head, I pay more attention to my posture, I stole a skirt from my sister just to try on every once in a while, I bought panties that I wear under my pants just for comfort sometimes, I started plucking my eyebrows and using some light makeup to give myself a slightly thinner looking face and I'm not really sure why any of these things feel right, but they do. I started looking back on my life and noticing that I had wanted to do a lot of these things before and just hadn't because they were ""wrong"" or ""dirty"". I remember being made fun of for ""walking and talking like a girl"" when I was a little kid and I remember my parents yelling at me when I let my sisters do my makeup. I'm kinda shocked I blocked this stuff out by the time high school came around. 

Over the past year, I haven't wanted to label any of this. It's a big enough wrench in my life hiding my sexuality from my parents while they pay for most of my college. 

I recently started asking myself a bunch of hypothetical questions like, ""If you could turn your body into a girl's right now with no consequences, would you?"" and ""Would you want to be a girl all the time?"" and ""Would you be a girl if it meant losing most of your old friends?"" and ""What if you could change your sexual features at a moment's notice? How often would you change from a guy to a girl? Would you rather be something in the middle?"" I don't know the answer for sure to a lot of these questions, but I know I would not only be a guy if I had that kind of choice. 

I didn't want to address this for awhile, at least until I was independent and on my own. But I've been getting more and more depressive episodes lately, where I just can't get out of bed for 2 or 3 days at a time. I talked to a therapist but I haven't brought up anything beyond my sexuality. I'm afraid this gender stuff might be the reason I get so depressed, like this thing that makes me happy is going to destroy the life I've built and there's nothing I can do about it. 

I finally broke down and told my best friend about this. They told me if I was unsure whether I was a trans woman or nb or just a crossdresser, I should start reading and listening and talking to as many people with similar experiences as I could. 

As much as I'd like someone to read this and say, ""Yep, you're definitely trans,"" or ""Nah, you're not trans,"" what I'm really asking for is if anyone here has similar experiences or if anyone has some good reading material I can look into with people's experiences on this stuff.

Also, I’m changing my name ASAP because I need something more masculine. I’m going with August.

Hey,

This is strange and don't know what to make what is going on with me. I recently came out bisexual last year and started exploring my sexuality. I use to crossdress when I was younger and stopped after I got caught dressed up in my sister's dress in a g string doing anal play. When I dress up it fills me with emotions that I never feel. I could be dressed up for awhile and be happy. I hid my feeling from everyone even me liking guys. I have really no interest topping guys because I feel more alive and feminine when I bottom. I still am highly attracted to women but I feel like I over think it when it comes to women. I feel like I would be more dominate with women but submissive with men. I grew up in a masculine household that was semi homophobic so I felt uncomfortable that I would be found out. For these things, I think I struggle with Masculinity and Feminity as a person. On the outside I am a tall, hairy, and masculine features but on the inside I wish I could just throw on a dress and a pair of heels and just act girly. I feel lost at the moment because I feel like I have a man and woman fighting each other inside me and no one wins. I get beyound aroused when I think of dressing up for a partner and call me a girls name. I feel just crazy admitting this. But I honestly feel like I am loosing my mind. When I was a kid. I was called fat faggot and ugly. So growing up thinking I was fat/ugly and believing it. Looked in the mirror thinking I was ugly. Hell even some family told me this.

Yes, T/ Estrogen are important

Yes, operation is important 

Yes, binding/ wearing a bra is important

These are all very good things that help people be who they’re meant to be. As soon as I get out of my house, I’m heading straight for a chest surgery and T. No questions about it. These are all critical to help my body align with my mind. 

But I am not just a body. Yes, my wings are crutched right now, but I must cultivate my strength because if not, when my wings are healed, I won’t be able to fly. 

It’s very hard. It’s darn near impossible some days, but I have to keep living- even though I don’t pass. Because even if I’m not living, if I’m not surviving, then I’m dying. 

I’m trying to cultivate my interests, I’m trying to find inner strength, and my beliefs now, even in this body. Because one day, I’ll pass as a guy. That may be in six months, that may be in four years, but I want to do more than pass as a guy.  I’m already a man. 

I want to pass as a gentleman
I want to pass as a romantic
I want to pass as a well read scholar
I want to pass as a philosopher 
I want to pass as a musician
I want to pass as an artist 
I want to pass as an activist 
I want to pass as a leader

59,2017-11-13 12:16:50,7cmpkb,5,4,"This is gonna be a *LONG* post. The end kind of summarizes my point, but I can't condense it further. Sorry.

I saw a Twitter post today that, while it clearly resonated with others, kind of terrifies me:

""...HRT does just as much (if not more) for [trans people] mentally as it does physically. We are not taking hormones merely to pass. We're taking them because there is a noticeable, measurable relief it gives our brains.""

Some of the replies included remarks like ""living before hrt felt like living under a heavy sheet of oppression,"" and I'm so, so glad for those people that they now feel comfortable. But I'm not sure I feel like that.

I've always been good at ignoring my body's signals. I've stayed up days at I time because night came and I was too in the middle of something to sleep. I've gone all day without eating because I just plain didn't notice. I've let my feet fall completely asleep because I noticed the signal they were tingling and wasn't ready to move yet. I went years without noticing that the disgust when I saw my chest had nothing to with how my breasts looked and instead had to do with the fact that I had them.

Realizing I was nonbinary awakened me to the regular dysphoria I'd already experienced and ignored. I didn't notice I was uncomfortable with one set of pronouns until I noticed I was more comfortable with another. I've rapidly come to discover that in addition to a flat chest, I craved facial hair, and a deeper voice. I craved androgyny.

Years ago, I was in a very bad place. The stress of trying to pass high school with an undiagnosed disability and years of emotional abuse and neglect left me with depression and social anxiety I was self-harming to cope with. A year ago almost to the date, I took LSD with my partner and gained a new perspective on life that really helped me manage my anxiety, and in turn, I found ways to get over my depression. I haven't been in as bad a mental place since then, and I really don't intend to return.

My pronouns make me happy, but my body does not. I love myself and my appearance, I just wish with all my heart it was different, in ways that are most easily achieved through transition. But I'm not in a bad mental place. I'm out to almost everyone close to me, and accepted by everyone I've told. I'm very lucky I'm that regard. As much as I yearn for the physical changes testosterone would bring, I don't always feel trapped by estrogen.

There are days when I don't mind my feminine features as much. Days when I worry that facial hair would ruin my looks. *Then,* there are days when I don't even want to talk to myself, let alone others, because the pitch of my voice makes me want to curl up and die. Days when hearing service workers call me ""ma'am"" and ""miss"" turns my heart inside out. I'm just. Afraid, I guess.

I'm not so much afraid of the effects of testosterone. I've asked myself over and over if the worst of the effects would be worth it, and the answer's come back yes every time. I'm just afraid that HRT won't be the panacea everyone makes it out to be. I'm afraid I've misinterpreted myself again, that even though I'm not a boy and I'm definitely not a girl, I'm not an androgyne either.

...I'm afraid I'm not broken enough to need fixing.

The number of people who that tweet resonated with, who described it as taking a weight off their shoulders... I'm afraid it wouldn't do that for me. I don't know that it could because I don't know if such a weight exists. I only know the perspective I have now. Trying HRT and discovering that it doesn't make me any happier, or worse, that it actively makes me unhappy, would leave me confused and distraught and with an identity crisis the likes of which I've never faced.

I need to do SOMETHING. I can't keep binding forever; eventually it's going to cause permanent damage to either my breasts (jeopardizing surgery) or my lungs (jeopardizing my singing) and I'd rather suffer daily dysphoria than deal with permanent pain, but really I'd rather not deal with it at all. Both HRT and top surgery are enormous undertakings that require total dedication though, and I can't be *that* certain until I have the perspective that doing one or the other brings more satisfaction than not.

I guess I'm looking for advice. Or encouragement. Or just. A different perspective. Someone who's gone through something similar. I'm neither strong nor brave enough to pioneer my own journey.

Background: Depersonalization is a cluster of distressing symptoms broadly described as ""feelings of unreality"" - a sense of separation from one's emotions, feeling the world is flat or lifeless or lacking in depth, obsessive ruminations about the nature of reality, feeling split into an observer in your head who narrates events and a participator who moves about in the world, feeling that you're robotic or like a ""zombie"" or even ""dead"". This can become a chronic syndrome, usually beginning in adolescence or sometimes earlier, and is highly distressing and associated with significantly elevated depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts, and severe impairments in school, employment, and relationships. Transgender people are several times more likely than the general population to suffer depersonalization disorder, and studies have found that transitioning, specifically HRT, reduces these symptoms in both trans men and trans women. Many trans people broadly share this experience of living a ""deadened"" life before transition, then feeling ""alive"" for the first time, often in the first few weeks or months after starting - a profound experience that often helps affirm for us the rightness of our gender and our choice to transition, and enables us to have a more full and enjoyable life that we'd been deprived of before.

Depersonalization disorder is notoriously difficult to treat among cis people, which makes the efficacy of transition an outlier. At the same time, some trans people continue to experience depersonalization after starting transition, and others may not be able to access transition treatments for various reasons. At least one study has speculated that these dissociative symptoms are so common that they may in fact be an inherent part of gender dysphoria itself. Treatment of this psychiatric symptom could be as beneficial to us as HRT is in relieving bodily dysphoria. For this reason, I've been investigating the potential role of add-on treatments that could help with this, starting from what's known about treatment of depersonalization disorder and what's known about the psychiatric effects of hormones.

Science nerdiness ahead: Estrogen is known to enhance NMDA function, and is also used as an add-on treatment in schizophrenia (in which the glutamate system is now known to be heavily implicated). There's also an observed overlap between some of the ""anomalous self-experiences"" of depersonalization disorder and the negative/cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia - emotional blunting, avolition, alogia, lack of spontaneity, and consequent severe difficulties with employment and life in general. Lamotrigine (Lamictal), an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer, is increasingly used as a key element of treatment of depersonalization disorder, and also modulates glutamate. Additionally, one major depersonalization researcher, Dr. Daphne Simeon, has received grants for trials of the NMDA glycine-site partial agonist D-cycloserine as an experimental treatment, and has recommended to patients that they supplement with the amino acid glycine in doses similar to that used in adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia (0.8g/kg/day, or on average about 60 grams a day). I've also spoken with a psychiatrist who suggested that D-serine and sarcosine (N-methylglycine), which are also used in add-on treatments of schizophrenia, could be used for depersonalization.

I've been speaking with other doctors in the know about this kind of thing, and we have a sort of budding NMDA hypothesis of transgender depersonalization coming together here. It also has some notable shortcomings and contrary evidence. It does not seem to account for the experiences of trans men. Trans men and trans women appear to experience depersonalization at the same rate, and trans men experience the same decrease in symptoms after testosterone as trans women do after estrogen. In the general population, depersonalization disorder has a 1:1 gender ratio, and there's currently no indication of any pattern of estrogen having any kind of protective effect as seen in schizophrenia.

Quite simply, I don't have the requisite background knowledge or experience to meaningfully account for this or tie this whole theory together any more neatly. But there seem to be the beginnings of something here, something that may usefully pan out into better treatment for at least some of us. So my questions are: Does anyone here know of anything that could hint toward a better understanding of how these various systems, symptoms, and treatments function together? Is there anything that, biochemically, accounts for the efficacy of testosterone in reducing these symptoms in trans men? (The HPA axis has also been marked as potentially involved in depersonalization symptoms, if that could be relevant.) And if there are any psychiatrists or other doctors with relevant expertise here, would you be willing to get in touch and look over the evidence base we've accumulated and offer your opinion of whether add-on treatment with these glycine modulators could be recommended for trans people with depersonalization?

I've been investing the differences in how people smell, based on biological sex. The biggest difference observable by just sniffing, is that cis male BO smells more like stinky cheese, and cis female BO smells like sulphur and onions. The difference is caused by different proportions of compounds in the sweat, which affects which odor chemicals are produced by the bacteria metabolizing sweat. 

The other component that people notice, possibly on a less conscious level, are some chemicals that testosterone and estrogen metabolize into. These are sometimes called human pheromones, and some (cis?) people find that wearing extra of the ones associated with their assigned at birth gender affects how people respond to them - levels of flirting, respect, etc.

The ""pheromones"" are already used as ingredients in commercial perfumes, generally marketed as a way to attract a date. The stinky cheese sweat chemical has also been used in commercial fragrances (though I don't know *why*...) and the estrogen-dominant sweat smell might be, too. This doesn't mean /too/ much about safety, because fragrances are practically unregulated in the US, but it implies that making a cologne that makes a person smell more like an un-perfumed person with the opposite dominant hormone might be possible.

Does this seem worth pursuing? I'm considering investing the time and money to figure out how to do this, especially if it might be useful to others, but I'm not sure if smell has enough of an effect to be worth it, or if this might have risks I'm not aware of.

90,2017-11-20 01:05:27,7e5331,12,9,"I'm going to be candid.  I have no idea what I'm doing.  But I feel so goddamn alone right now and I could really benefit from someone hearing my story.  So I guess I'll post this on Reddit and see if anything good comes of it.  

Hey everyone, cis straight male here.  I'm 19 years old and very, very confused.  But I'll take a deep breath and start from the very beginning.

I was born to a religious family.  Raised Mormon, in a household that felt kind of devoid of paternal presence and such.  I was the lonely brother, outnumbered by three sisters, my mother stayed at home and my father worked day in, day out.  I'm number 3 of 4 and in my second year of college.

Anyway, being raised Mormon, my world view was narrow and built for me.  There were certain fundamental truths that defined my life and my interactions, i.e. there is a universal, undeniable truth and good and morality.  And one of those was that God created each and every human being precisely as he wanted, and that genders and gender roles exist for a reason.  They are a part of one's divine destiny and to go against such destiny is blasphemy.  I mean, I never really thought too much of it.  I never really sought any of those huge truths for myself; I more or less went to church because my family did.  For a time, I think I did believe, but I guess it's obvious that I don't anymore.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, here.  Ever since I was little, I've had this strong desire to be something other than what I am.  When I was a toddler, I wanted to be a dog... when I was eight, I wanted to be a Pokemon.  And I suppose this all culminated at the point I reached a few years ago... that I wanted to be a girl.

I'm not one of those people who had a childhood in which they always wanted to play with dolls or dress up and their father simply didn't let them.  My toys were dinosaurs and cars and legos (I know that it's not right to categorize toys into 'girl' vs 'boy' but hey, the psychology and stuff suggests that there is a difference), and I was actually terrified of my sisters' Barbies.  When I was little, I first wanted to be a firefighter, then a veterinarian.  I don't think I had aspirations to be anything other than what my parents said was normal, and no one's childhood recollection is super accurate so I'm trying to remain objective, compare what I remember with my mother's account.  But as far as she says, I was a normal, healthy, happy child, and I fit in well with all the other boys my age.

There are weird things I remember that always made me feel a little out of place, like the fact that Wurmple was my favorite pokemon because it was so stinkin' cute, and my friends all laughed at me for that, instead opting for the more badass ones, y'know, little things like that.  Once everyone started hitting puberty, I was tiny compared to my male peers.  I got picked on relentlessly because I was horrendous in our P.E. games and didn't know how to throw a football.  I remember my dad trying to teach me how to throw a punch and being disappointed that I couldn't land a good one.  And those bullies always attacked my masculinity calling me the classic middle school insults.  At one point, one called me out for holding my books like a girl with them close to my chest.  They said I ran like a girl and threw like a girl.

I watched a lot of TV when I was little, mostly Nickelodeon.  There was some show called 'Mr. Meaty' and while I never watched it, I saw a handful of commercials for it.  There was one episode where they had the 'girly burger' or something like that with some special 'girl sauce' on it.  Anyway, the male characters accidentally ingested some and became female temporarily.  All I remember was chills down my spine, a whispered 'I want that' in the back of my mind.

There was the episode of Drake and Josh where Drake jokingly suggests that Josh become a woman to get out of some crazy misfortune they found themselves in.  And I remember getting chills again, finding out that a transition is actually possible, and then I dreamed of it for the next few days.  This episode broke that predetermined set of values that I had inherited from my faith and asserted that just because I am a male does not mean I necessarily need to be one.  And I found that exhilarating.

Granted, I was still very young.  These experiences are from my elementary school days, and these ideas quickly faded from mind.  But later when the bullying picked up and I found myself all alone, I wondered what the hell made me such an odd fit with my peers.  And I don't know if I'm just remembering it incorrectly, but today, I think it was my feminine disposition that they picked up on and drilled me for.

So I guess that'll suffice for the 'early life' section of this wikipedia page.  Everything henceforth is from (give or take) the past 5 years.

My sophomore year of high school, I began to have firm doubts about my faith, and by junior year, I decided I wanted nothing to do with it.  But I never told my family.  I persisted in the church, keeping up this facade that I was the good, faithful Mormon boy.  I lived under that guise for way too long, I even spent my first year of college and Brigham Young University to keep it up until that institution finally broke my spirits and I transferred to a state school.  But with this identity shattered, I was left to discover myself as an individual, to discover my own beliefs and philosophies, etc.  I was so lost.  I putted around, sank deep into depression and was barely saved by my tiny circle of friends.  I just felt so alone, like I'd never be understood, that I could never afford to reveal myself to my family because of how they'd respond.  I knew my apostasy would break their hearts and I just couldn't stand to witness that.

So I persisted, going to church and all that.  But there was a point in my senior year where I think all this dysphoria finally caught up to me.  I've always been self-conscious about my body, wearing shirts at the beach and in the pool, and once I was largely finished with puberty, I had some excess breast tissue.  It wasn't that much and I still have it today, but it was certainly noticeable.  The very few times they saw me shirtless, my friends would comment on how huge or floppy my nipples were and that always made me feel godawful.

So I tried working it off, using the rowing machine in the basement, running outside, cross fit... but none of it worked.  And one night, when I couldn't sleep, I just stood in the bathroom and stared at my naked body, crying at what I saw.  And throughout my life, I've had a lot of thoughts that I would be better off female, but I think this is the first time I REALLY thought it.  Like I would've accepted an offer to switch in a heartbeat.

The thought scared me, even though it made sense.  I opened my laptop, my first instinct was to search for some test I could take that would tell me definitively whether or not I was trans.  Something came up, I did it, and it declared me androgynous.  I cried myself to sleep that night and fell into one of my deepest depressive slumps and this question was the foremost in my mind.

I spend that summer depressed as hell.  I was working for my dad and the job sucked ass, I was having this internal battle of whether my body agrees with my identity, and I was still keeping up this image of the loyal, religious son.  And that fall, I set out for BYU.

I never told anyone any of this.  I'd heard my parents talk about depression in very scathing, stigmatizing words.  They said depressed kids were just entitled pricks looking for a handout, so I obviously didn't go to them.  But I had a high school friend who had recently left her family's faith, so I called her up when I couldn't bear to keep pretending.

I told my parents via written letter and talked about it over the coming weeks and months with them.  Things got bad, then they started to get better.  And then I was hit with this wave of dysphoria again, on top of this crisis.

I called the same friend from before and told her between sobs.  She was so sympathetic and understanding and told me that I can't force an answer to a question like this.  I had to pull a Doctor Strange and submit myself to the forces, rather than trying to manipulate them.  So that's what I tried to do, and it only got me so far.  I entered a cycle of ""alright, I'm good, gonna be a male, hoo-ha"" to ""if there was a god, I would've been born a girl..."" so on and so forth.

I left BYU with these questions still on my mind.  In my dreams, I would be female, in a handful I was just cross-dressed.  I had dreams about my mother and letting her down and I just couldn't stand to do that.  There was the moment of bliss when I looked in the mirror and saw a confident woman stare back, but also the moment of despair when my mom saw right through me.

Arrive summer, I started working at Chipotle, and in the mornings I was home alone.  So I'd work on a feminine voice, then, and eventually I decided to try cross-dressing for the first time in my life.  And I loved it.  I did it for hours, in and out of my mom's closet, twirling in the mirror.  I watched vlogs of post-procedure trans women and felt so uplifted.  That summer, I frequented a therapist who helped me talk out my family and religion issues, though I was extremely hesitant to voice my gender concerns and didn't tell her until our remaining visits were very numbered.  Then I left for college again.

And I guess that more or less brings us to the present.  The dysphoria comes and goes, but right now I'm in a slump.  I want insight, questions, just anything to help me feel like I'm not alone in this.  If you can help me figure this out, I'd love to hear what you have to say.  If this is something I just need to figure out for myself, please help me do that.  The biggest thing, I guess, is that I'm just so goddamn afraid.  I'm terrified that I'll make the wrong choice and regret it forever, or that I'll be ousted by my family and what few friends I have.  I'm worried I'll never be able to pass as a woman, and that I'll be too embarrassed to go outside when I'm in the middle of transitioning.

tl;dr: I don't feel like I fit the stereotypical trans girl mold, but I'm in crisis and could use some insight.

Thanks so much ahead of time.",trans,My Story (Please help me),1511165127.0,"{'created_utc': 1511139927, 'id': '7e5331', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'I\'m going to be candid.  I have no idea what I\'m doing.  But I feel so goddamn alone right now and I could really benefit from someone hearing my story.  So I guess I\'ll post this on Reddit and see if anything good comes of it.  \n\nHey everyone, cis straight male here.  I\'m 19 years old and very, very confused.  But I\'ll take a deep breath and start from the very beginning.\n\nI was born to a religious family.  Raised Mormon, in a household that felt kind of devoid of paternal presence and such.  I was the lonely brother, outnumbered by three sisters, my mother stayed at home and my father worked day in, day out.  I\'m number 3 of 4 and in my second year of college.\n\nAnyway, being raised Mormon, my world view was narrow and built for me.  There were certain fundamental truths that defined my life and my interactions, i.e. there is a universal, undeniable truth and good and morality.  And one of those was that God created each and every human being precisely as he wanted, and that genders and gender roles exist for a reason.  They are a part of one\'s divine destiny and to go against such destiny is blasphemy.  I mean, I never really thought too much of it.  I never really sought any of those huge truths for myself; I more or less went to church because my family did.  For a time, I think I did believe, but I guess it\'s obvious that I don\'t anymore.\n\nBut I\'m getting ahead of myself, here.  Ever since I was little, I\'ve had this strong desire to be something other than what I am.  When I was a toddler, I wanted to be a dog... when I was eight, I wanted to be a Pokemon.  And I suppose this all culminated at the point I reached a few years ago... that I wanted to be a girl.\n\nI\'m not one of those people who had a childhood in which they always wanted to play with dolls or dress up and their father simply didn\'t let them.  My toys were dinosaurs and cars and legos (I know that it\'s not right to categorize toys into \'girl\' vs \'boy\' but hey, the psychology and stuff suggests that there is a difference), and I was actually terrified of my sisters\' Barbies.  When I was little, I first wanted to be a firefighter, then a veterinarian.  I don\'t think I had aspirations to be anything other than what my parents said was normal, and no one\'s childhood recollection is super accurate so I\'m trying to remain objective, compare what I remember with my mother\'s account.  But as far as she says, I was a normal, healthy, happy child, and I fit in well with all the other boys my age.\n\nThere are weird things I remember that always made me feel a little out of place, like the fact that Wurmple was my favorite pokemon because it was so stinkin\' cute, and my friends all laughed at me for that, instead opting for the more badass ones, y\'know, little things like that.  Once everyone started hitting puberty, I was tiny compared to my male peers.  I got picked on relentlessly because I was horrendous in our P.E. games and didn\'t know how to throw a football.  I remember my dad trying to teach me how to throw a punch and being disappointed that I couldn\'t land a good one.  And those bullies always attacked my masculinity calling me the classic middle school insults.  At one point, one called me out for holding my books like a girl with them close to my chest.  They said I ran like a girl and threw like a girl.\n\nI watched a lot of TV when I was little, mostly Nickelodeon.  There was some show called \'Mr. Meaty\' and while I never watched it, I saw a handful of commercials for it.  There was one episode where they had the \'girly burger\' or something like that with some special \'girl sauce\' on it.  Anyway, the male characters accidentally ingested some and became female temporarily.  All I remember was chills down my spine, a whispered \'I want that\' in the back of my mind.\n\nThere was the episode of Drake and Josh where Drake jokingly suggests that Josh become a woman to get out of some crazy misfortune they found themselves in.  And I remember getting chills again, finding out that a transition is actually possible, and then I dreamed of it for the next few days.  This episode broke that predetermined set of values that I had inherited from my faith and asserted that just because I am a male does not mean I necessarily need to be one.  And I found that exhilarating.\n\nGranted, I was still very young.  These experiences are from my elementary school days, and these ideas quickly faded from mind.  But later when the bullying picked up and I found myself all alone, I wondered what the hell made me such an odd fit with my peers.  And I don\'t know if I\'m just remembering it incorrectly, but today, I think it was my feminine disposition that they picked up on and drilled me for.\n\nSo I guess that\'ll suffice for the \'early life\' section of this wikipedia page.  Everything henceforth is from (give or take) the past 5 years.\n\nMy sophomore year of high school, I began to have firm doubts about my faith, and by junior year, I decided I wanted nothing to do with it.  But I never told my family.  I persisted in the church, keeping up this facade that I was the good, faithful Mormon boy.  I lived under that guise for way too long, I even spent my first year of college and Brigham Young University to keep it up until that institution finally broke my spirits and I transferred to a state school.  But with this identity shattered, I was left to discover myself as an individual, to discover my own beliefs and philosophies, etc.  I was so lost.  I putted around, sank deep into depression and was barely saved by my tiny circle of friends.  I just felt so alone, like I\'d never be understood, that I could never afford to reveal myself to my family because of how they\'d respond.  I knew my apostasy would break their hearts and I just couldn\'t stand to witness that.\n\nSo I persisted, going to church and all that.  But there was a point in my senior year where I think all this dysphoria finally caught up to me.  I\'ve always been self-conscious about my body, wearing shirts at the beach and in the pool, and once I was largely finished with puberty, I had some excess breast tissue.  It wasn\'t that much and I still have it today, but it was certainly noticeable.  The very few times they saw me shirtless, my friends would comment on how huge or floppy my nipples were and that always made me feel godawful.\n\nSo I tried working it off, using the rowing machine in the basement, running outside, cross fit... but none of it worked.  And one night, when I couldn\'t sleep, I just stood in the bathroom and stared at my naked body, crying at what I saw.  And throughout my life, I\'ve had a lot of thoughts that I would be better off female, but I think this is the first time I REALLY thought it.  Like I would\'ve accepted an offer to switch in a heartbeat.\n\nThe thought scared me, even though it made sense.  I opened my laptop, my first instinct was to search for some test I could take that would tell me definitively whether or not I was trans.  Something came up, I did it, and it declared me androgynous.  I cried myself to sleep that night and fell into one of my deepest depressive slumps and this question was the foremost in my mind.\n\nI spend that summer depressed as hell.  I was working for my dad and the job sucked ass, I was having this internal battle of whether my body agrees with my identity, and I was still keeping up this image of the loyal, religious son.  And that fall, I set out for BYU.\n\nI never told anyone any of this.  I\'d heard my parents talk about depression in very scathing, stigmatizing words.  They said depressed kids were just entitled pricks looking for a handout, so I obviously didn\'t go to them.  But I had a high school friend who had recently left her family\'s faith, so I called her up when I couldn\'t bear to keep pretending.\n\nI told my parents via written letter and talked about it over the coming weeks and months with them.  Things got bad, then they started to get better.  And then I was hit with this wave of dysphoria again, on top of this crisis.\n\nI called the same friend from before and told her between sobs.

I've (MtF) been presenting female more regularly now, after 1.5 years on HRT and a lot of tumult in my life that got in the way of focusing on my transition, and somehow my dysphoria has found ways to strike even when I'm feeling happy in my skin.

It's the small things, like watching an episode of Golden Girls and seeing the characters (a bunch of old women) reminisce about their childhood-- then sobbing for a while because I feel wrong for not having had any prototypical girl experiences in my youth. 

What it comes down to is a struggle to own my life experience as being 'womanly.' I stay stuck in a mindspace where I feel broken instead, 'built wrong' such that I can't fit as anything-- I can more easily talk about growing up with men, and only other trans people can nod in understanding when I explain the mess my adulthood became due to dysphoria. I have no touchpoints with the average ciswomen other than a handful of relatively superficial things like makeup skills, whining about estrogen-fueled moods, and having been taken advantage of by a friend in college (fucked up that that's a touchpoint, but experience has shown me it is; society's screwed but that's a different conversation).

I guess I'm also just uncomfortable about the concept of a 'trans experience' because it furthers the concept that there's two kinds of women, trans and cis-- to me at least 'trans' and 'cis' should just be to clarify whether one was assigned their proper gender at birth or not, I don't want them to refer to two distinct life experiences. And yet it seems I'm experiencing empirical evidence that they do.

Is this the price of going through the wrong puberty? I imagine for trans people who never go through the wrong puberty and go through most of their childhood as the correct gender, this is much less an issue. Maybe I'm not experiencing a universally trans thing, just a thing for those of us who are forced to double dip on the delightful (/s) experience of puberty.

This is driving me a bit crazy. I'm sure it will pass and I will grow to accept my life-story, but for now it makes me feel like a sham.

Why not? Obviously, none of yall should kill yourselves. But why shouldn't I? 

It sounds silly maybe but there doesn't really seem to be any logic to it. I'll try to cheer people up, tell them they will see the light, because I don't want them to die, but there's no logic behind it. It's just some vague feeling I have.

I want yall alive simply because I love you. If I didn't, I literally would not care if you died.

If I don't love myself, where is the reason for being alive?

Every answer seems really shallow/trivial. People's sadness? It'll pass, time heals all wounds and all that. On a tiny scale that's irrelevant, on a large scale too. Experimenting all of life's wonders? It's not like I'll be full of regret when I'm dead. 

The concept of death itself seems absurd. Being alive seems kind of boring and tedious, so what's the point? 

It's not that I'd rather be dead, it's just being alive seems so... lackluster that it's not worth it. Being dead is a matter of perspective. Since I can only ever access my own, I will simply be not alive. sarcastic ""oh no"".

Like, this isn't some cry for help or comfort (not that there's anything wrong with needing help : ), I just fail to grasp the logic behind ""alive"". 

I won't be able to cheer y'all up, which is admittedly sad, but that only matters to me because I am ""alive"".

Is my contribution to this world a positive one? Perhaps. But assuming it is, so what? I only care about said contribution because I'm alive. And yes that's a selfish perspective. Because I have a self.

It's a bit of a catch 22 (maybe? I get that wrong a lot); I need to be selfless to want live but I can only truly be selfless by killing my self.

Can I kill my self without killing myself (as the buddha did)? doesn't seem like a reliable solution tbh

I think I’m trans. I’m not sure if I’ve always thought I was trans. I have reason to believe I always thought I was a guy (when I was younger I wrote stories about being a guy, and I wrote songs to girls and stuff), but I may be wrong, I dont remember my childhood well. 

I’m scared this is just a fad I’ll grow out of, but when I was younger I starved myself a bit to prevent chest development, and I worked out a little too much for a 13 year old. 

I’m doing my best to not describe behaviors, because that’s stereotypical (though stereotypically, I was/am more masculine).

The other day I got to thinking about not having a Y chromosome and I got really sad, because I’ll never know my whole genetic lineage, but it left me thinking- If I could have both XY chromosomes, and thus be a man, but look the same (present female) or present masculine, but have XX chromosomes, I think I would prefer to have XY chromosomes. 
Though i hate getting called “ma’am” and “Ms.” I’d rather know internally who I am is real... if that makes sense.

I love my parents for the most part; they tell me they love me, and make sure I have food on my plate, and a roof over my head, but they get me so angry. 

I can’t go a day without my mother looking at me like I’m some fucking disgrace to the family. She cries as if she wished I would have died rather than come out as trans. I asked her to give me a name- I wanted something meaningful to my family, but she rejected the idea. Fine. I told her my name and pronouns, but she said she’d never use them. I feel so disrespected. 

My dad has no real fault here, besides not using my name and pronouns despite knowing them.

Every time I act like myself, she gives me ***the look*** she’s disappointed in me and says “You never did XYZ before.” 

*“You wore a dress six months ago.”*

Yeah, I also wished for nothing but the bitter embrace of death six months ago. 

Now, this has been going on for some time, and whatever, I can take it. I’m strong, but what truly brings forth my fury is their racism, transphobia, homophobia, and inability to look beyond themselves and give some human compassion. 

I don’t even want to type some of the things they’ve said about minorities, and you know what’s great? ***We’re also a minority*** (I’m Latino). 

They’ll stare at a person until they can figure out their birth sex, and then use those pronouns- even when the person presents and makes clear that they would prefer otherwise.

My father almost makes me hate being a man because of how he regards women sometimes.

I say all this not because I’m mad at them (I am), but because I’m mad at myself. 

I could stand up to them when they’re being jerks to other humans, and I often do, but I’m not doing enough. I’m 18, I could theoretically leave. I could go and start hormones and be done with this. 

But I haven’t. I have 3,000 dollars ( I had 8,000 but they took 5,000 from me when I was a minor). I could leave and never come back. 

But I don’t. They’re going to pay for my college, and as much as I can’t stand how much control they’ll have (they don’t want me to transition. I’m going to anyways), they’re going to let me leave for college. I want to have a financially stable career. I want to see if I can help the world some. 

I have a plan- I’m going to file as independent next year for financial aid. I’m only going to socially transition this first year. After that, they can’t tell me anything.

145,2017-11-28 01:27:31,7g0bpt,6,3,"Hi everyone, 

I would like to get the opinion of some of the lovely people on here :)

I have lived my whole life without questioning my manhood. However, ever since puberty, I have always had sexual fantasies about being in a womans body in sexual situations. So basically when I masturbate I tend to imagine myself as the woman in the porn I am watching or even having sex with my girlfriend, I sometimes as I imagine myself as her. For a really long time I thought those fantasies meant that I was gay. However, I am not attracted to men, and I am definitely attracted to women. So I really don't see how that could be the case. So recently I posted in a facebook group dedicated to sexual fantasies asking if people thought my own fantasies were weird, and a handful of people suggested that I was trans and didn't realize it. Others suggested it would be damaging to my mental health for others to inform me I am trans because I have been having these fantasies my whole life, because gender identiy is a completely seperate entity than sexual orientation. For the latter reason, I don't want to jump into assuming I am trans if it is not necessarily the case. However, without jumping to conclusions, I am trying to be as open minded here as possible, So I have a few questions, /r/trans : 

-What kind of things do I need to be asking myself(or possible experiment with) to allow me to discover whether or not I am trans? I don't know where to start which makes it extremely hard for me to explore this.

However, ever since puberty, I have always had sexual fantasies about being in a womans body in sexual situations. So basically when I masturbate I tend to imagine myself as the woman in the porn I am watching or even having sex with my girlfriend, I sometimes as I imagine myself as her. For a really long time I thought those fantasies meant that I was gay. However, I am not attracted to men, and I am definitely attracted to women. So I really don't see how that could be the case. So recently I posted in a facebook group dedicated to sexual fantasies asking if people thought my own fantasies were weird, and a handful of people suggested that I was trans and didn't realize it. Others suggested it would be damaging to my mental health for others to inform me I am trans because I have been having these fantasies my whole life, because gender identiy is a completely seperate entity than sexual orientation. For the latter reason, I don't want to jump into assuming I am trans if it is not necessarily the case. However, without jumping to conclusions, I am trying to be as open minded here as possible, So I have a few questions, /r/trans : \n\n-What kind of things do I need to be asking myself(or possible experiment with) to allow me to discover whether or not I am trans? I don't know where to start which makes it extremely hard for me to explore this. \n-Has anyone else had a similar fantasy that eventually led to them realizing that they were trans?\n-If I we're trans, would I simply know it?

Hello, I'm 18 and come from Poland. Since I was 10, or even younger, i remember thinking of myself as a girl. This feeling later faded out during puberty, but has been coming stronger than ever since my 18th birthday. I already went through one depression stage at 17, yet recently i just feel like crying every night because being a boy disgusts me. The thing i hate the most is hair. Body hair is awful and i feel awful when i see it at its fullest every day when i shower. I tried shaving it before but just ended up making my places very itchy, so i had to give up on that idea and try and live with it. One thing worth mentioning is that i don't mind having a penis, i'd like it if it was hairless. I don't like my face: it has a squarish, manly face. I get really sad browsing progress pics of some beautiful girls here and realizing ill never look like this. I'd love to get help, but if my parents learned about this, they would probably just alienate me and not help with anything. This is Poland, so i doubt that even medical professionals would be of any help. I want to leave this country as soon as possible: when i finish high school, i dont want to go to a university: this would ensure a few more years like this. i want to seek work in an english speaking country and start an actual life.

I was wondering are there any gifts, Items, objects or anything you wish you had had in the early stages of transitioning/coming out that made you feel More Masculine or just happier or accepted? I was thinking that aftershave might be a good gift(?)  I want to make sure the gifts he receives are useful and maybe avoid some less informed members of the family from gifting inappropriately.

Of course everyone is different and will have different tastes but I don't get to see him a lot and I want to make the gift count.

I'm MtF, 6 months with HRT. I work for a large company in the City of London. ""Large"" as in, we are using two floors in the building. There are floor plans all over the place and today I counted the desks in my floor, it's 560 people here. This is in the IT sector so I don't expect there to be 280 women but let's say 200. 180. It doesn't matter.

I'm growing my hair, I paint my nails, I dress like a woman (well, no skirts yet :)) and I even use high heeled shoes. People on the ball should be thinking that there's something going on.

I'm in talks with HR about a broad comms to the company at large regarding my name change and also mentioning my upcoming change in appearance (FFS). The toilet issue will have to be addressed too. I'm the first trans here so HR is lacking some experience about what to say and who to tell. This post is specifically about whether to let every single female in my floor know that I'll soon start using *their* toilet.

* There are women who I work with on a daily basis, they should obviously know. Some of them already know even.
* Women who I don't work with but they sit nearby and we see each other on a daily basis, they should probably know too.
* Women who I talk to maybe once or twice weekly, they should know right?
* Women who I see daily when walking around the workplace (eg. when going to my locker) but I have no other interaction with them. I don't know their names, they don't know mine. I'm that weirdo who looks like a woman. Should HR tell them? Keep in mind that we'll eventually happen to meet in the toilet and they will recognise me.
* Probably, women who work at the opposite corner of the building and we'll never meet except in the toilet. Before the FFS this will be weird at least. Should they know?

A part of me thinks that yes, we should tell all 200 or 180 or whatever females in my floor. But I can't help thinking that that's overkill and some (most?) of them won't care as long as they can go to the restroom in peace.

Do you have any advice about this?

I'm trying to bring my weight down a bunch before they give me the actual E pills, but I'm now waiting on a letter being sent to my doctor so he can write me the prescription. (Which I won't be taking to my local pharmacy, screw that, they're all judgy pricks.)

I'm still a couple weeks off, but I'm free and clear now. Four years of waiting. Let me tell you how my day went.

The start of the day was stressful, horrible and annoying. I woke up at two in the god damn morning after barely sleeping at all, I got showered and made it to the train station with seconds to spare. The train was in, the first ticket machine was being a git and the second one had four people ahead of me. The train was about two minutes for leaving, I start using the machine and stick my card in. Like an idiot I use the wrong PIN the first time so I have to do the whole thing again.

I got my tickets, fucked off up to Edinburgh with about an hour to spare before my appointment, so I decided to go to CEX and buy a bunch of DVD's again. Yeah, I still watch DVD's. Sue me.

After a liberal slathering of purchases and Howl's Moving Castle not being in stock *again* I went up to Chalmers. Now, I'm not gonna lie, I'm a fat bugger, so I wanted a burrito. The burrito van was shut, so my plan to get them before the appointment went out the window. I went on past, went into the clinic to be taken early and then I sit in front of the endo while he talks a bunch about stuff that's not important.

Then he says the thing. I expected to be told I'm too fat and I'd have to lose a couple stone before they'd give me anything. I was right in thinking that, that's the reason they've dodged doing anything for the last nearly two years. This time I was wrong. The dude told me he'd write my doctor to tell him to write me a prescription of T blockers. I was struggling not to smile when he told me, it was the best news I could've hoped for. 

So now I'm on a high, I'm excited, I'm relieved and I wanna go cry happy tears for a change. This is when I got my burritos. I got two, one to give to a family member, then headed off to Primark to have a nosey around for Christmas presents and boxers. I prefer loose underwear, okay? Don't judge me. Especially you back there, I can see you. 

Long story short everything went really well after this. Sure my burrito got poked open by my headphones, but a quick tin foil purchase repaired it and it didn't leak that badly. I got me a quick Maccy D's (not helping the weight loss there, huh?) then hopped on down to the platform for my train. 

There was a guy with a single rose. He sat in a shelter on the platform, a smile on his face as he gazed lovingly at his phone. I got on my train, got sat down and all comfy like. At this point the train hadn't been marked for a destination or anything, but that's fine because it wasn't the wrong train anyway. I looked out the window to see Rose Guy standing waiting while a train pulled in from across Scotland, when it did a bunch of folk got off. That's how trains work. Boom, he finds who he's looking for, gives her the rose and, in a fantastic romantic gesture, they hug and do couple stuff, idk.

My point is it was wholesome AF, especially for the middle of Edinburgh on a busy Tuesday. Oh yeah, this happened Tuesday lmao. Anyway, it was cute and made me smile. Then I smiled about my good news. Smiling topped with a smile sauce, prepared with a happiness I've never felt before when I looked out at Scotland rolling by as I headed home. 

Tuesday was a mixed bag. Sure, I got my clearance for hormones, I got a burrito then I saw some wholesome shit happen. It was great until my aunt took real bad ill and I had to go up to hospital with her and only got home at like 4AM.

Lately I've been questioning my sexuality and now my gender and I'm not really sure why, but it's weird because this has happened before a few years ago, before I met my ex boyfriend. I was in a really weird place mentally, kind of a depression but maybe it was just a place of like being confused about my gender, and all this stuff. But as soon as I found my ex boyfriend, I suddenly felt female again and kind of was embarrassed and scared that I had wanted to be a man so badly. And for a long time I was relishing in being feminine and growing my hair out and feeling pretty and everything. Keep in mind I have no experiences with women in dating, so I don't know if I'd feel this same way with a woman.

Now it's been about half a year since my ex and I broke up, and I've been living with my parents who are narcissists (I'm a frequent poster in the raisedbynarcissists tag lol) so I'm wondering if my gender struggles are around just being depressed and maybe trying to escape into some other personality, like a typical C-PTSD ""freeze"" response, or if actually just being away from men (compulsory heterosexuality) and being single has made me more self-reflective and my true self is trying to finally come out. I don't really feel dysphoria, it's more feeling pleasure at presenting as male, drawing moustaches on myself because I like how it looks, maybe being more nonbinary than transitioning fully to male. Idk, I just worry because I have wanted to be a guy before but I met the ex bf and suddenly all my plans for transitioning flew out the window, ya know? And looking back maybe I've been lying to myself thinking I wanted the whole white-picket fence hetero relationship but really I think I'm like super queer/bi. I know sexuality doesn't have anything to do with gender but it feels like it does while I'm trying to sort it all out. I am wondering if I'm a lesbian, but also I am super attracted to gay men, so I thought maybe it's coming from the male side of me and I am actually a trans man and bisexual.

Keep in mind I have no experiences with women in dating, so I don\'t know if I\'d feel this same way with a woman.\n\nNow it\'s been about half a year since my ex and I broke up, and I\'ve been living with my parents who are narcissists (I\'m a frequent poster in the raisedbynarcissists tag lol) so I\'m wondering if my gender struggles are around just being depressed and maybe trying to escape into some other personality, like a typical C-PTSD ""freeze"" response, or if actually just being away from men (compulsory heterosexuality) and being single has made me more self-reflective and my true self is trying to finally come out. I don\'t really feel dysphoria, it\'s more feeling pleasure at presenting as male, drawing moustaches on myself because I like how it looks, maybe being more nonbinary than transitioning fully to male. Idk, I just worry because I have wanted to be a guy before but I met the ex bf and suddenly all my plans for transitioning flew out the window, ya know? And looking back maybe I\'ve been lying to myself thinking I wanted the whole white-picket fence hetero relationship but really I think I\'m like super queer/bi. I know sexuality doesn\'t have anything to do with gender but it feels like it does while I\'m trying to sort it all out. I am wondering if I\'m a lesbian, but also I am super attracted to gay men, so I thought maybe it\'s coming from the male side of me and I am actually a trans man and bisexual. Y\'all have any experiences with this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I\'m 24 by the way.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Only feel urge to perform as male when single and depressed?

To make things short, I have fibrocystic chest tissue. This makes small/moderate sized lumps that are noncancerous, but frankly annoying, sometimes painful, and awfully foreign feeling. 

My doctor (pediatrician) said that if I was feeling any pain that I should go to her. 

I am planning to bring up the issue of pain at my next physical (a couple of months late by now). 

There’s a medicine called danazol that can almost completely shrink the lumps by 6 months or at least a year, and in addition it slows estrogen production and is (mildly..) androgenic and anabolic. 

It can have  “side effects” I really want, like  lowered voice and hair growth, with a decreased potential for bottom growth. 

I have no idea how to talk this over with my doctor. I don’t know if she would tell my parents why I want to take it, in addition I’d want to shoo my mom out of the room as well.

I've let all my hair grow out on my body. Been using male body products. Been looking into going on T. I barely feel female anymore. 

The more I look back on my life, I've always presented male. There was times for short periods or a couple years where I gave into everyones expectations on me. Everyone in my family pressured me to be more femine even outside family like friends, boyfriends, counselors. So I did what they wanted. And now that I'm finally finding myself, im stuck trying to figure out if im ftm or transmasc. I don't really think I'm genderfluid like I thought. There's some things that I like that are femine. I use to love wearing dresses and leggings. But then I got tired of it after a while. I'm just so lost with who I am. How do you know?

28,2017-11-08 16:57:30,7bmm3i,12,12,"Hi all, I’m looking for a little advice about my possibly genderqueer/transgender son.  Basically, I’m not sure if he’s just being a four year old or if there’s more going on.  

Last week, my son(?) told me hysterically that he wanted to be born a girl.  This was in response to a discussion about how only women can breastfeed babies because of mammary glands.  I told him he could pretend though.  He’s expressed a desire in the past to be a mom and have babies (he has a younger brother and a new baby sister), but I didn’t think much of it because he spends the majority of time with me (his mom).  I assumed it’s just what he sees and knows, and of course being a mom is wonderful.  Otherwise, he’s never struck me as uncomfortable with being cis-gender.  

In response to my son’s hysteria, I consoled him saying that he can be anyone he wants to be; he could be a girl if he wants to; all I want is for him to be happy.  I asked him if he wants me to call him a girl, and he said yes.  Over a few conversations the next few days, he’s maintained his desire to be girl.  He doesn’t want to share this with his friends, but teachers and friends’ families are okay.  I haven’t asked him if he wants to dress any differently out of a desire to not stereotype the clothes he already has.  Not more than 5 minutes after one of these conversations, he asked to get a hair cut (he already has pretty short hair).  He said when he grows up he wants to be a man.  But he’s also said “when I’m a kid, I want to be a girl.” And “some days I want to be a girl and some days a boy.”  When asked how he feels like a girl, he said “in all my body parts.”

I consider my husband and myself to be fairly progressive with our parenting — we make a big effort to not gender toys, clothing, actions, jobs, etc.  But still, we refer to our son with male terms.  We shop (with a few exceptions) in the boys’ section of clothing stores.  This week, I’ve been making an effort to just use his name, not gendered pronouns.  And female pronouns when necessary.  He doesn’t seem to care.  I really think he would be comfortable expressing himself any way he wants to, which is why the sudden desire to be a girl was so shocking.  

So any thoughts?  If this is the start of a journey, I want to support him.  But right now, I can’t tell if he’s just being a child and exploring things, or if he is seriously expressing a desire to not be cis-male.  If it’s the latter, what should I do?  I’d rather follow his lead, but I’m not sure what the best way to do it is.

I was on a panel of queer people for an educational Q&amp;A program at my college, and my friend (who was also on the panel) started some major spats with me about certain terms that I was using, and though I defended myself, I was wondering if maybe I was actually in the wrong here.

First, I used genderqueer as the umbrella term for gender nonconforming folks instead of trans (for ref my friend is trans and I identify as NB). I think trans is binary, and really excluding (bc it is a specific label in itself already!) , and it makes more sense to me as a parallel to queer as the umbrella to sexual minorities (side note does anyone oppose to that use of queer?). 

Second, I identify as biromantic. I use bi instead of pan- or poly- romantic bc pan usually implies no gender preference from what I've seen (and I highly prefer NB folks over men over women) and poly is so easily confused with polyamorous. Not to mention, I just personally relate to the label more and there is an established bi community.

Both Tinder and OKCupid allow you to list your gender as something other than male or female. However, both still require you to decide if you'd rather be included in searches for men or women. I don't really understand why they can't have a third category for people who'd rather not be included as either of those, but whatever.

If you use those sites/apps, how do you decide if you'd rather show up in searches as a man or a woman? Do you go by your own comfort level/self-identification? Which gender you typically pass as? Your transition goals (if any)?

I feel like letting myself be listed as a woman is probably the lowest-pressure option right now. I'm AFAB and haven't transitioned except for coming out as non-binary. I'm undecided about medical transition. I like the idea of having a male body, but I don't really mind how my body is right now for the most part. But I do see myself as more of a guy than a woman, and when I try to navigate online dating, I'm very self-conscious about how people see me. I worry about people seeing my profile come up in a search for women and deciding that, regardless of what my profile says, I'm basically a woman. But calling myself a man feels like a lot of pressure when realistically, I know that most people who are looking for male partners probably won't find me attractive in that way.

I am **questioning my gender** since a couple of years, and since then I am really struggling. 


I am **born male**, and since always I had this **difficulty in recognise myself** as what others saw me. It was like they said to me I was something that I always struggled to recognise. 


I think that I can resume my life saying *""Well, yes, I am X, and... uh... I do this... and that...""*, and *feeling almost nothing*, or feeling weird things.


But most of all, I **always had doubts about who I was**. 
I also struggled to have something I like (I can surely say I didn't really like anything in my life), and when I tried to became something in the ""male spectrum"", I failed. But most of all, I could not say **who I was*.


One day, I saw myself into the mirror, not the SELF the OTHERS saw in me, but the self I SAW: a girl.
That was the first day that I started really seeing myself, and I could ""start"" answering to the question: who am I? Now I can say: &lt;&lt;I am a girl...and...I feel...&gt;&gt;

HOWEVER, shaving is, um, not the greatest thing for me.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but it seems like some demented god of body fuzz has cursed me to look like a short, mange-ridden wookie, and any attempts to remove this with a blade lead to the kind of razor burn best described as malicious demons pissing on my legs.  It's upsetting.

A friend recommended Nair Men, and lo and behold, it actually kinda works.  Not the best on stubble or short hairs, but for long ones, excellent, as long as you follow directions.

Now, I'm certain some of you in here have expertise and skill in hair removal that deserves a black belt and the title of ""Most Honored Sensei"" (and if any of you wanna chime in and tell me what I'm likely doing wrong, feel free, oh my god, help).  However, I'm also sure some of you are, like me, just starting.

I hope this story helps you, or at least gives you a giggle at my expense.

So, I was doing Nair Men for the third time ever today (like I said, recent stuff). Now, I have this weird thing where, once a hand gets designated for a task, I tend to use that hand for that task.  I'm right handed, but certain things (scratching, straightening hair, fidget cube) are basically left hand only.

In this case, this was to my detriment.  My left hand had become ""Nair Hand"".  And I have a lot of area to cover.  My legs need to be bare for my peace of mind, as does my ass, as well as chest and stomach.  Coating my everything takes about 15-20 minutes.  You aren't supposed to leave Nair on you for more than ten minutes, and for my body, I'd taken this into account.  I finish my left leg, check time, finish right leg, check time, make notes when to start wiping, and so on.

However, it had completely eluded my inexperienced self that there was Nair on my left hand this entire time.  For three treatments over about a week and a half.

So, I'm doing my treatment today, getting some cream, smearing it on, getting some cream, smearing it on, getting som-- OH MY GOD, MY FINGERS ARE BURNING.

I now have a mild chemical burn on the pads of two fingers on my left hand.  It isn't horrible, and I'm sure it will heal within a short time, less if I get some Aloe on it.

However, that hurt.  Like, papercut meets Bic lighter hurt.

So, if you use Nair Men, spiffiness, stuff is decent.  However, wear gloves, or swap hands, or rinse your hand frequently during.

Really, if this saves one person pain and embarrassment, totally worth typing out.

And again, if anyone has hair removal tips, I'm a damned empty cup here.

Even when I am around nerdier guys, however, I feel like I need to put up a front that doesn't allow me to be expressed as the nerdy person I truly want to be in the vein of still being a guy.

Like, I find it easier to connect with girls, however I feel awkward wanting to become friends with them since, well, I'm also attracted to them. I find it very hard to feel like I can approach women in more open social situations and strike up conversations since I'm seen as a guy. What woman wants a guy coming up and randomly talking to her?

Like, if I was able to dress how I wanted, I'd probably toss just about all of my guy clothes and dress in girl clothes. If I was able to express myself physically how I wanted, I'd probably be somewhat into makeup and into wigs and other things. If I was able to shape my body how I wanted, I'd probably be shaped like a very athletic female. If I was able to express myself sexually the way I want, I'd probably be a flaming lesbian (now, I am attracted to the idea of penises, penises turn me on like crazy, the same way pussy does, only different, if that makes sense, I just don't have an attraction to men, men don't turn me on at all).

Like, about the biggest thing that I find it hard to say is ""I'm a woman,"" that feels wrong. Everything else about wanting to feel female feels right, just being called a ""woman"" feels wrong, even though ""she"" feels better to me than ""he"" and a slightly feminine name feels better to me than my own.

Like, I have found the term ""demigirl"" and it seems to fit me the most. If I had to use labels to describe myself, they'd probably be ""genderqueer demigirl lesbian.""

Who am i:
Well, i dont really know.. but AMAB, 22. 

whats this about: 
when i was young, i crossdressed, did girly things, had urges to look like a girl at times. time went on--no crossdressing or anything--2 years ago, HUGE URGE, then i questioned it--is it something bigger? went on crosssdressing reddit--talked with ppl, made my way to genderfluid reddit b/c i thought i fit there

why im here now:
2 years later, im back after a long hiatus, doing counseling at school about this, and questioning more. Back on reddit. Thought id visit this reddit to see what people thought. 

how i see it-

Right now, i feel like im nonbinary, or somewhere in this area... I like to dress up in womens clothes, i actually would love it if it wasn't stereotypically socially wrong for men to wear womens clothes and makeup, all that stuff. I do feel feminine and girly when these things happen, or even when i see or hear feminine things i get really interested and want to participate, more than any person would normally do. I love getting my nails done, even when im totally being in my male mode. (and this is like having bright pink acrylic nails lol). I would like to get my ears pierced and wear girly earrings--i have my hair long so i can have it look feminine. Ummm....idk.. i enjoy all these feminine things,and i do kind of wanna look more like a girl, but i don't really have an issue being a guy. I could do without looking manly though. I've never really been into it... (i really hate having body hair...) 

conclusion--
Basically...I don't really know exactly what all this means. I kind of feel like i mix into the crossdressing (though i feel like its a *tiny bit more than that, but i don't want to be just a crossdresser??), and nonbinary side of things, because of my expression outside of dressing up and such. I also am not very manly, and I don't really have an interest in masculine things.. 

I could say a ton more, but i feel like i've said enough.. 

thoughts? similar experiences? I'm not sure what i want to hear, or what i should expect. I've heard everything from ""you're just a guy who likes these things"" to ""you are transgender"".

99,2017-11-25 16:40:22,7fga3m,10,48,"Hi!  I just wanted to stop in and maybe introduce myself.

I'm AMAB, and from a very young age I knew I didn't fit the body I was in, but I didn't have the words or the environment in which to express that.  I struggled with it from the age of four up through the end of high school, at which time I managed to suppress most of my feelings of wrongness.

A couple of years ago it all came roaring back, but by this point I had a wife and a daughter, so I tried to run from it again.  I stayed far from anything feminine, cut my hair short, grew a beard, all trying to stave off this sense that I was not meant to be a man.  Eventually, when I finally gave in and came out as trans, it was *super* liberating.  It took me a while to get my wife to come on board, but she's bisexual and has always been very open-minded.

Lately, I've been struggling again, but in a somewhat different way than before.  I've been kind of, not quite *un*happy, but something still felt off in a way I couldn't quite articulate.  I've been to both sides of this great big binary, and neither side was *it*.

So I looked between the two, and started deconstructing what gender really meant to me, and to society.  I know I feel much more in-tune with womanhood and femininity, but I don't feel like that's exactly where I am.  These rigid roles that we're assigned based on the way we're perceived just seem so arbitrary, and I don't really fit into any of it.  I don't think I want to try anymore.

I sort of finally came to this realization last night, and since then I've felt that same relief and sense of freedom that I felt when I came out as trans.  It's been a long time since I've felt so at ease with myself.

I've been less stressed, I've liked myself better, I've been able to experience motivation and ambition, and my relationship with my wife has improved.  It's all good things, and I'm happy about it, amazingly so.

What I'm not happy about is the reactions within myself I'm still trying to overcome, placed there from being raised male.  Anyone AMAB who went through your teenage years, you get this.  It's these knee-jerk, toxic masculine reactions to things feminine.

I've embraced my tendency to, well, be energetic and flamboyant, to walk with a bit of a bounce, but there is this voice in my head telling me to set my hips, to walk solid, to not look ""weak"".  I'll watch trans femme or genderqueer vloggers, and a lot of myself envies them, and looks up to them.  But again, there is that male upbringing, trying to chime in with how people would react to me looking and acting feminine, how I should hide it and be ""strong"".

There is the fact that people raised male are taught to consider anything feminine as lesser, and weak, and vulnerable, and something to be hidden and overcome.

And holy shit, do I hate it.  

I love dressing in feminine clothes, and will be buying more.  I love losing myself in my new skin care routine, and enjoying making myself pretty.  I love the moments where I'm not self conscious about everything, and I can just enjoy being me and learning who I really am.

I just hope this voice slowly gets quieter.  Because it is an ass.

So, AMABs out there, if you have this voice, I feel you, and I'm sorry.  And just try to realize, like I am, that it isn't actually ""you"", it's toxic bits that society has crammed into you, conditioned responses forced by a sexist culture.

I've been having a hard time, on my 2nd outing I got a drink thrown on me when a cis-gender male up-downed me even though I wasn't putting out a vibe. Back story, I'm AMAB genderfluid/bi-gender, questioning sometimes if I'm full transgender. I also happen to be gynesexual if it matters.

The comment mixed with another female co-worker grabbing my hand and saying ""I've never noticed you paint your nails, why are you doing it?""

She's also been going around to our mutual friends and asking ""whats wrong with him? why is he painting his nails?"" She's been doing it under the pre-tense she cares about me, but in my circle we know she's being super catty.

It's been putting me in a shitty place, about a month ago was the first time I went out when it isn't Halloween, I went to an awesome concert. Put on my makeup, clothes, wig, heels, and felt super pretty. My sister said she's never seen such a big smile on my face when I showed her the pictures. 

It's been a tough month, I've also been working a lot. So my 2nd outing, my co-worker being shitty and catty, my friend saying ""you're being attention seeking"", and a date where I was very upfront about myself and she was trying to force me to prove my masculinity as well has given me a lot of stress.

About a month ago I finally allowed myself to become comfortable with a part of me thats existed for a very very long time. Without giving away too much info its been quite a few decades dealing with this and heavily closeting myself from realizing that I am genderfluid/bi-gender/trans. My therapist thinks I'm genderfluid/bi-gender and advised me to just live my life. 

I recently used the FaceApp and it made me look like a version of myself that I like. When I look in the mirror I've never been quite happy, but never could put my finger on it. People tell me I'm quite handsome, but I've never felt it. Even though I have some very masculine hobbies, I've always yearned to play with makeup, loved fashion, and heels.

Until recently finding out gender identity != sexuality, I didn't know people like me existed. That you could still be only attracted to cisgender women and still be the way I am.

I also happen to be gynesexual if it matters.\n\nThe comment mixed with another female co-worker grabbing my hand and saying ""I\'ve never noticed you paint your nails, why are you doing it?""\n\nShe\'s also been going around to our mutual friends and asking ""whats wrong with him? why is he painting his nails?"" She\'s been doing it under the pre-tense she cares about me, but in my circle we know she\'s being super catty.\n\nIt\'s been putting me in a shitty place, about a month ago was the first time I went out when it isn\'t Halloween, I went to an awesome concert. Put on my makeup, clothes, wig, heels, and felt super pretty. My sister said she\'s never seen such a big smile on my face when I showed her the pictures. \n\nIt\'s been a tough month, I\'ve also been working a lot. So my 2nd outing, my co-worker being shitty and catty, my friend saying ""you\'re being attention seeking"", and a date where I was very upfront about myself and she was trying to force me to prove my masculinity as well has given me a lot of stress.\n\nAbout a month ago I finally allowed myself to become comfortable with a part of me thats existed for a very very long time. Without giving away too much info its been quite a few decades dealing with this and heavily closeting myself from realizing that I am genderfluid/bi-gender/trans. My therapist thinks I\'m genderfluid/bi-gender and advised me to just live my life. \n\nI recently used the FaceApp and it made me look like a version of myself that I like. When I look in the mirror I\'ve never been quite happy, but never could put my finger on it. People tell me I\'m quite handsome, but I\'ve never felt it. Even though I have some very masculine hobbies, I\'ve always yearned to play with makeup, loved fashion, and heels.\n\nUntil recently finding out gender identity != sexuality, I didn\'t know people like me existed. That you could still be only attracted to cisgender women and still be the way I am. \n', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'A friend said ""I\'m saying this is the nicest way possible, you\'re exhibiting attention seeking behavior.""', 'created': 1509547999.0}"

It's not exact, though. And additionally I feel incredibly stupid and awkward and *illegitimate* for feeling like that.

Because you see, apparently I'm just an oddball of a (mostly)het cis guy, and yet.

And yet for something like half my life already I've felt something in my sense of gender is off. It's not even something I try to hide, it's something I've talked about with probably everybody important in my life. In a confused and oblique manner because I've never been actually sure what it IS or how to CALL it.

The most candid way to put it is this: It's okay to be a guy, I'm just bummed I only get to be a guy and have to be one all the time. In fact I'm bummed everyone [please feel free to dissent] has it like this, in my eyes it's like everybody is missing half (or more) of the picture. How very bummed I am about this fluctuates* over time.

I can relate to an extent with what trans people say, but I have no desire to be cut up or to have my sexuality scrutinized by doctors or shrinks and I'm totally fine with my genitals.

But frequently I also feel stumped because I can't animate my body properly because it won't move how I'd like it to; or self-conscious about how I animate it because I'm doing so in a way I feel it's patterned after how I've seen a girl do it.

How I feel about my physical features is an entirely mixed bag. Example: I like my chest hair but have several reasons for hating my beard. Fun fact: I don't have a visible adam's apple.

* I like girls to no end; I only like guys once in a blue moon and so far I haven't had sex with a guy; I can crush and swoon over both.
* I don't fit into male-exclusive groups. They make me antsy and defensive.
* I don't have an issue with either male or female pronouns (or adjectives, which are also gendered in Spanish, my native language)
* My sexual fantasies involve pretty much any combination even if in different proportions (hetero, lesbic, gay, trans of various kinds) and none of them is a required ""crutch""
* I might as well be invisible to cis-het girls: Every person who has had sex or a relationship with me, or admitted attraction or feelings to me, or pursued some sort of relationship with me has been either bisexual or trans or both. Makes you think.
* I don't like make-up save exceptions (on me or on others)
* I don't have an urge to crossdress but I'd so do it if I had a partner that was into it.
* I *DO* have an urge to sneakily express all this weirdness through my appearance and behavior. I don't want to make it my greeting card, but I want to be read by people that might react positively, everybody else just writes me off as an oddball (something which has pros and cons but which is largely unavoidable in my case). When everything falls in line I feel gorgeous and garner both male-oriented and female-oriented compliments. Takes a freaking planetary alignment or something though.

All in all, I don't want to change my body a lot or make a political point out of myself, but I would like to develop more freedom and control in using my body to express myself; and I don't really find myself in the gender identities I've familiarized myself with so far; elements yes but never the whole picture.

27,2017-11-13 07:25:09,7cljy2,1,2,"This week with me coming out at work and in my social circle was a whirlwind of big time changes in my life.  And so far, it has gone super good.

I was pleasantly surprised at how supportive my team members have been.  As I've mentioned before, my manager, who is somewhat conservative in his politics, has come to be one of my biggest supporters.  This has to do with the fact that he has a non-binary family member and has supported them from day one.  That brings the number of people on my team with trans/non-binary family members to three.  The rest of my team has taken it super good, even the guy who has been known to push the limit with his wisecracking jokes.  He did make a good natured joke with me, and I responded in kind.  Hopefully it shows him that I can still coke and joke with the best of them.

There is good news to also report at my house.  I live in a townhouse  that I bought a couple of months back, and came out to my gay neighbors.  They invited me over of course.  To my pleasant surprise, I learned that both of them have a non-mainstream experiences with gender, as one of them is FTM and the other identifies as androgynous but still considers himself male.  I wonder if one of my other neighbors might be trans as well.  I say that because I have a pretty good transdar and this person indicates to me.  That said, I figured that maybe seeing me being out, that they might reveal as such if it's the case.  So of the 8 units in our development, 2 are confirmed trans/non-binary households, and maybe another??

What can I say, I knew how to pick my job and my house quite well :)

The week was of course full of a lot of unpacking of my emotions, which were crazy powerful at times.  I was standing in my kitchen at one point, and it felt like I had a connection to a divine power of sorts.  I was able to sense that I was supposed to be the way I am, someone who can psychologically embody both masculine and feminine energy.  That said, I've been holding a masculine presentation for too long, and I VERY much enjoy getting in touch with my femininity.  I know my presentation is going to be femme of center for a while whenever practical, with maybe some androgynous or gender neutral days thrown in.  One very positive thing is that my desire to drink has gone way down.  While I wasn't getting black out drunk left and right, I was drinking to self-medicate my dysphoria.  In fact, I've only had 4 drinks in the last week.  Compared to 2-3 a night and sometimes more for the last several months is a major thing IMO.

There is still the road ahead, more people to come out to, and I know there's going to be a fair share of snags and bumps.  I've started coming out to more friends who I was previously closeted to, and so far they've all taken it fairly well.  While I'm not fully out on Facebook, I went a happy medium route and set up a filter to where people on the ""approved list"" get to see my full authentic self.  I'll eventually fully come out there, but this allows me to come out to as many of my close friends and extended family as possible outside of social media first.  While all of my immediate family has known how I relate to gender for almost a decade now, only two of them know how I'm currently proceeding.  It likely won't be a big shock to them per se, but I know my dad is likely going to be the most problematic about it.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he can at least grow to understand why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that we can continue to have a healthy relationship.  Another challenge will be several family members who are pretty religious.

While I wish I could have done this a long time ago, the fact is that I wasn't ready for it until now.  And now that this is reality for me, I am actually able to fully enjoy life.  Being a military veteran and having all of this coincide with Veteran's Day made me pause and think.

29,2017-11-13 13:10:23,7cmysw,4,3,"I posted this in the butch lesbian subreddit but I thought yall might have some insight too.

I’ve been a lesbian for a long time and I’ve never been into men, ever. I was femme for a few years and a little over a year ago I started becoming butch. (I’m turning 22 this week just for context)

But two weekends ago i went to see a trans guy friend and I realized I want to be his boyfriend? And that’s alarming not only because he is a guy but also because of the boyfriend thing.

And i kinda figured out that like, I can only see relationships as being of the same gender. Like, I’m his boyfriend, I’m my nonbinary partner’s partner, and if I dated a girl I’d be her girlfriend.

But that just... it seems so simple but I’m so uncomfortable going through my tumblr dash bc I followed so many lesbian blogs and now I can’t relate to them even tho I 100% did like *last week*, because there’s such a focus on anti-men sentiment and while I still feel that within myself from a woman’s perspective, I feel it very differently from the perspective of the trans gay man I guess I am as well.

I used to hate men and I have trauma with men and I’ve been gradually getting over that but a lot of things about manhood and  masculine culture trigger me especially IRT men being attracted to women... so that’s there too.

Also I don’t really feel like a real man??? I’ve felt like a “fake man” for a while now just as a butch lesbian because the idea of being butch (for me) was like, taking on a “man’s role” and playing a sort of pretend man, and that hasnt changed for me at all, what’s changed is that I actually prefer he/him pronouns when talking about my relationship with my boyfriend — basically that it’s gay.

At first I was terrified that I was misgendering my boyfriend because he’s trans and very feminine-presenting, but I don’t think that’s the case anymore, there have been times in the past where I considered that I can be attracted to men only if I see myself as one and over the week I have thought about fictional men in relation to myself as one rather than just using m/m ships and it actually feels natural, just like when I used to ship myself with female characters (of course, when that happens generally I still have long hair etc, i used to be very femme).  Also I know it’s normal for gay trans men to be attracted only to other trans men.

I don’t think I’m just a trans man though because I’m equally comfortable and uncomfortable with he/him pronouns and being assumed male as I am with she/her pronouns and being assumed female. I prefer not being gendered at ALL unless it’s in the context of being the same gender as my partner (or if I’m talking about like, someone being hot or cute etc). It makes me feel really uncomfortable thinking of myself as a man when I think about women, and it made me equally uncomfortable when my boyfriend called me “lady” when we were together.

And it makes the sexuality thing difficult because a lot of people on tumblr say you can’t be “male-aligned” (im still confused about what that means but that’s a whole other story, I’m going to guess I’m both male and female aligned) at any time and use the term wlw (women-loving-women). I don’t ID as a lesbian anymore unless it’s me explaining that I’m sometimes a lesbian and sometimes a gay man, but I thought that saying I’m both wlw and mlm (men-loving-men) would work. Now I’m not so sure. I still feel very strongly about keeping men out of lesbian-only spaces and I lean towards just interacting with those spaces only when I’m a woman (for example if I get a girlfriend and go to a lesbian event or something with her, idk), but I’ve seen posts that make me wonder if that’s still violating boundaries.

Those posts also make me wonder if this is a common experience at all. I’ve heard of lesbians becoming gay trans men, but I’ve never heard of someone being both at different times.

And I think I’m also shaken because I’ve had such a strong connection to lesbianism and the lesbian community (especially butch community over the past year) and now I don’t feel like I HAVE a community, except perhaps the genderfluid one but I don’t think my specific experience is a common one at all because mine is directly related to my partner(s) and I’ve never seen that before. I don’t feel like I have anything in common with bi people enough to call myself that and seek out that community because when I think of myself as a woman I’m ONLY attracted to women, and same for men. I can’t feel any different-gender attraction at all and that’s the entire point. It would feel wrong to say I’m bi.

And this might just seem like arbitrary label nonsense and I might just have to live with being in LGBT limbo for the rest of my life... I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else here has heard of this or (by some miracle) feels similarly.",genderfluid,Gender shifts to be the same as my partner?

It's weird because i feel like I am stuck in this spectrum, and while thats fine, i sometimes feel like it would be better if i did have a label, at least i could say im genderfluid or something---IDK..

It's weird because i feel like I am stuck in this spectrum, and while thats fine, i sometimes feel like it would be better if i did have a label, at least i could say im genderfluid or something---IDK.. I really don't know. \n\nAny other AMABs out there still trying to figure it out, or kind of where i am? it's hard to explain.. I've been doing counseling for about a year and i feel like ive made little progress. \n\nTLDR: \nAMAB and cool with assigned gender, but kind of feminine and likes girly things, thinks im genderfluid but idk. help . \n\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': ""I'm back.

52,2017-11-23 05:49:15,7exhbi,3,1,"apologies for long post---i think im going on overload here.

AMAB, 22, long hair (been growing out). I guess with my long hair, i look kind of androgynous, especially since ive been misgendered as a woman. But hey, I don't have a problem, per se with my assigned gender, i guess... not yet.. idk.

I posted the other day after returning from a 2yr hiatus. I've been doing counseling at my college, ever since I a HUGE urge to crossdress 2 years ago, after a long time of not dressing up at all. At that time, I started to question if I was trans or not, just a crossdresser, or just a dude with weird habits. I don't like calling myself a crossdresser because I like to express some of my femininity in public, like getting my nails done (like, bright pink, acrylic nails). Since then, I've been getting advice, and ways to think about what the hell does this all mean. 

One of my goals is I want to be fully dressed up, makeup and everything, and truly look like a woman, because then, I could really see what it feels like, or something like that. but im scared to follow through with it.

 I could continue this longer but let me get to the point: 

After posting yesterday, and looking at the comments and advice (thank you to all who replied, really. &lt;3 ), I started just digging through this subreddit, reading other people's stories, finding relatability. I then started to question myself some more. 

I just recently (like 10 minutes ago) started to get frustrated because I don't want to be a crossdresser, but then I don't want to be trans, but I don't want to make this a big deal! I then texted my best friend about this, and she gave me some examples of some guys she knew and how they did certain girly things, but i dont know them, and I don't know if they are straight, white men. I don't know their stories, or if they've crossdressed. I started asking her tons of questions and then rapidly apologizing and telling her to forget what i said, because I felt like i was being stupid asking her and making a big deal out of it. and then, I just felt really bad about it. fast forward 10 minutes. Here I am, writing this block of text.

 Like i always ask myself, is this valid?? Am I lying to myself? But, wait, i do like painting my nails, I do like being girly, but is it just because I have these interests? does that make it less valid?? It's really annoying..

Now that I experienced that, I can't help but wonder if that was dysphoria. I don't know and that why im asking. If it is, then...idk. I guess maybe this is getting to a point where i need to really look into this.

but then again, AM I OVEREXAGGERATING? should i just say f--k it and do these things, or should I get better professional help? I think im going to talk with my counselor earilier than i had initially planned to talk with her because I set something up in january, but now i feel like i need to talk with her really soon. 

sorry for the long post. this hurts my brain.

When I feel particularly feminine, or ""FEEL LIKE A GIRL"", I don't really say ""i am a girl"" today, although I'll admit many of my masculinity dies for that time being when i am being feminine, but I like that.

Does this make my thinking less valid? Am I thinking about this all wrong???
