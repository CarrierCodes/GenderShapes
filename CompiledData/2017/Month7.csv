It's taken me a long time to feel more comfortable being out as non-binary, and I'm still getting there. One of my major hangups has been feeling like I don't ""deserve"" to have people acknowledge my gender identity and that I can't expect them to understand or see me the way I want to be seen. However, I've been fortunate to be able to be able to volunteer in some theoretically trans-friendly environments, and that's made me start to feel more comfortable.

But I had an awkward experience recently. I do some LGBTQ-related volunteer work, and we often start events and meetings by going around the room and introducing ourselves with our names and pronouns. I actually have some mixed feelings about this. When I initially started this work, I felt awkward because I wasn't really out yet and felt pressured to either out myself or lie. Now I am more out, but it feels weird when I'm often the only person in the room who uses non-binary pronouns or who doesn't pass as the gender they identify with. It really puts me on display. And while I understand that a lot of the intent of this exercise is to challenge the idea that you can assume someone's pronouns just by looking at them, I don't feel like I can take for granted that the environment is really going to be inclusive toward non-binary/gender-nonconforming people if it seldom comes up. When all the male-passing people use ""he"" and all the female-passing people use ""she,"" it's hard to actually know if people are good at remembering and respecting people's pronouns when they're not ""obvious.""

The other day, I was doing a volunteer event with a cis person who's one of the leaders of our trans outreach projects. In the context of the event we were doing, we actually talked about trans issues and the value of not assigning a binary gender to someone based on how they look. I was vocally out as being non-binary and using they/them pronouns. And yet the person I was working with *consistently* used female pronouns for me. It was very awkward. Ironically, I'm not actually that concerned about what pronouns people use for me. But if I'm in a setting where sharing is actively encouraged, and I state that I use they/them, it's *really* noticeable if someone disregards or forgets that. And it was awkward that some of the others in our group, who were a lot less familiar with trans people, made a much bigger effort to not misgender me than the person who was supposed to be an expert. I didn't say anything, and I didn't really *want* to say anything. And I don't want to be unfair, because I know that realistically, it can be hard for some people to remember pronouns and get used to non-binary pronouns. But I also feel like if we're creating settings where there's a lot of emphasis on using the correct pronouns and not misgendering people, it looks bad if those principles aren't followed well in practice.

I have an amazing friend, who recently started her transition from f to m. He's still far away from surgery and and hormones, but the first steps have been made. Cool.

I'm female, and have always been attracted to girls. Never really dated a guy, just had some casual one night stands when i was in college. I don't like to call myself lesbian or bisexual or whatever, because well...it feels like a limitation.

When i met this friend he was still female (and dating a girl) we met online and had some awsome conversations about love, relationships and gender. I learned a lot from him.
We only met irl recently, and this is were it gets confusing for me. Looking at him he has all the ""bodily aspects"" of a female and for the time being he's cool with that (always been genderfluid). Saying that when he's more femine he is more attracted to girls (lesbian) and when he's more masculin he's more into guys (gay), pansexual?

I felt an instant attraction and told him that. We had sex a few times. And i still feel incredibly attracted to him, the confusing part is....i feel attracted to him as he is now...but even more when i think about him after the final stages of his transition. Does that sound as weird as i think it does?

To add to that, i'm not even sure if i identify as a girl...but this is the first time i've said that out loud and i'm kinda scared to say more. 

I'm starting to question everything i thought i knew about myself.

How the hell am i going to bring up this whole attraction subject? I really do not want to offend him (or anyone else for that matter).
I'm sorry if i've worded things wrong, my English isn't that good.

I hope I'm not intruding/being offensive by asking this, I'd just like to broaden my understanding of gender issues. My fianc√©(MTF, male pronouns ATM) came out to me as trans last year and since then, I've learned a lot about gender issues in order to support him through his transition and understand more about how he feels. However, his emotional perception of gender is a very binary view: male, or female (part of this is his fear of hormones changing him enough he doesn't look like his natal gender, but not enough to look his actual gender). As a result of learning some stuff from him, I feel I have as much of an understanding of that aspect of being transgender as is possible, given that I am cisgender. However, I have many gaps. 

In a way, viewing things from a binary perspective is more simple. If you're unhappy with your natal gender, then transition to living as the opposite gender. I can begin to guess at how this might feel. One of my friends is nb and they realised this after they began transitioning and realised that presenting as female didn't feel right either and they liked the small changes brought about by hormones in the early stage that game them a body that wasn't strictly male nor female. This sentiment is sort of echoed by the word ""nonbinary"". It isn't defined by what it is, but by what it isn't: neither male nor female. It's like the concept of cold, cold doesn't exist, only a lack of heat. 

From speaking to my fianc√©, it is clear to me that he feels not just a dislike of his male features, but also an overwhelming wanting of female features. He has been happier since starting to see changes of HRT, not just because of relief of the removal/minimisation of male features, but also a feeling of rightness of the growing female features. 

I'm probably not making much sense. I suppose what I'm asking is ""what does being non-binary mean to you? Do you feel defined by a lack of gender, or something else? How did you know you were non binary?"".

46,2017-07-09 09:59:27,6m6p77,13,20,"Hello everyone ! Sorry for the rant, it might be a bit too long and messy but I really need to talk about it right now.

Where do I start ?

Most of the times, I feel ""female"" or, at least, I'm not bothered by my body and I can go on with my daily life without any problems. I have bought feminine clothing, have a wardrobe full of dresses and skirt and cute cleavage tops. I like to feel sexy and beautiful. I like my curves and my long hair and wear makeup.

But sometimes... It's the contrary. It happened several times on my life, periods where I would feel more male and these periods could last many months to one year, I think. During these times, I bought clothing from the boy stores, bought binders and wanted to present and be seen as male (even though I didn't say anything about it so no pronouns or short hair or anything, it was just how I felt in my brain and I was happy with every steps I took to look more masculine.)

I am in one of those ""phase"" right now, it has been like this for ... 3 weeks I think ? I don't really now what started it (I never knew). 

I'm thinking of cutting my hair short. I'd never done that and I'm SO scared because I don't want to regret it later - as I seem to be running in and out of phases, what will I think of myself when I won't have this desir to look male again ? I'm sure I'm gonna cry about my lost long hair. But in the meantime - when I look at the mirror now, I can't see ""myself"". I don't... I don't know how to say this. It's like I'm looking at a picture on a magazine. Like ""yeah these hairs look great on that face but whatever these are not mines"". I already cut like 10cm to see if a fresh new cut would change my mind, but no. 

I'm also beginning to hate my chest again. I have a big cup (34C) and even with a binder on, it's not awesomly flat like I would want it. I'm also hating on my curves (54kg for 1m60) that make me look feminine even though I wear boy clothes - or I would need to wear baggy ones and I don't like that, plus they look shitty on me because I'm short. Frankly, right now, I'd have to have them gone. 

I'm also concerned by my height. I'm so fucking short there's no way I could pass as male - or maybe a fifteen y.o. boy, ahah. That's bugging me a lot. I tried to wear insoles lifts when I went out three days ago and the feeling was fantastic but I had to take them off because it hurt my foot. The euphoria was gone.

Also, when I was a child, I was always with boys and girls found me strange haha (not sure if that's relevant). I had a hard time during college to fit in. During high school, I felt out of place too. All the time. Felt like a zombie... After high school, I think I learned how to be ""pretty"" in a girl way and that made everything easier (felt accepted by other and there was no bullying anymore). I learned how to look and act to feel like I was like the other - not left alone.

And about my body...
Yesterday, I was talking with my girlfriend through messages and she teased me like ""i want to touch your breasts/belly"" and I just... Started crying and I think I let out all of that stress from the last weeks. Going to try boy clothes that doesn't fit even in the XS size the same day sure didn't helped me either. 

My GF herself says that she feels more masculine and wears boy clothes and such, too.

What I'm wondering is...

Am I feeling like this because I am influenced by her ? (But I had theses phases during years before, so... ?)
Did I start crying because I didn't want her to touch my ""girl"" body or my ""fat"" body ? (I want to loose weight...)

I've gone trough my old clothes recently and seen all my dresses. I remember how pretty I was in a dress, and how pretty I could be in a dress. I know I get dysphoric wearing one, but I can't stop wondering if I still should try to be a woman. I want to look attractive. Also I feel attractive in a dress. It's just that it always feels like a show, and I'm tired of people believing in that show. I've tried on some dresses with my binder, and it really helps with the body dysphoria. It's a shame that most dresses have such an open neckline that they don't really work with binders. At one point of my life I wore womens' suits because I was too dysphoric for dresses. I could't do that any more. 

I've never tried on a (proper size) men's suit. The idea of having a suit is somewhat intriguing, but as I'm pre T I'm just terrified because I know I would just look like a woman in a suit, a butch lesbian, and a 12 year old chubby boy because of my soft skin, chubby cheeks and curves in the wrong places. I'm 29 and athletic feminine gay/pansexual man/non binary (?). I don't want to look like a chubby 12 year old boy or butch lesbian. The idea of wearing a suit just feels so uncomfortable. I want to be handsome.

Maybe it's just because I've been trying to repress my feelings for so long that I still feel shame for wearing a suit. I feel just so stupid, because I know many of my female (?) friend also wear men's suits or part of men's suits. I also can't stop wondering if I'm not really trans. 

Also the approach: ""you do you, wear what makes you comfortable"" isn't really helping, because wearing a dress makes me dysphoric because of my body and because everyone assumes I'm a feminine woman. Wearing a suit could be better regards to the body dysphoria, but it still accentuates all the details that show I don't have the body made for a men's suit, and uncomfortable because I assume I look fat and ugly.

The idea of having a suit is somewhat intriguing, but as I\'m pre T I\'m just terrified because I know I would just look like a woman in a suit, a butch lesbian, and a 12 year old chubby boy because of my soft skin, chubby cheeks and curves in the wrong places. I\'m 29 and athletic feminine gay/pansexual man/non binary (?). I don\'t want to look like a chubby 12 year old boy or butch lesbian. The idea of wearing a suit just feels so uncomfortable. I want to be handsome.\n\nMaybe it\'s just because I\'ve been trying to repress my feelings for so long that I still feel shame for wearing a suit. I feel just so stupid, because I know many of my female (?) friend also wear men\'s suits or part of men\'s suits. I also can\'t stop wondering if I\'m not really trans. \n\nAlso the approach: ""you do you, wear what makes you comfortable"" isn\'t really helping, because wearing a dress makes me dysphoric because of my body and because everyone assumes I\'m a feminine woman. Wearing a suit could be better regards to the body dysphoria, but it still accentuates all the details that show I don\'t have the body made for a men\'s suit, and uncomfortable because I assume I look fat and ugly. And there\'s always the potential: ""wtf is she wearing?"". ', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Do you feel awkward wearing a suit pre T?', 'created': 1499705665.0}"

Now, for like the last 5 years or so, the main thing that's been keeping me from living as myself full time has just been fear about being out at work, and in my professional life in general.

Many of them follow my twitter, and I've been quietly out on twitter for a while now with no notable consequences.

59,2017-07-12 09:14:19,6msste,4,11,"am i nonbinary/agender? sorry this post is long. also sorry if i'm ignorant. i really don't know a lot about this.

I've always carried around this feeling of being drastically different from other girls, and not in a cool YA fiction novel way. I feel it in a bad way, like i'm not good enough to be a girl. 
When i was young i didn't entirely believe i was a girl, i felt alienated from them but saw the possibility of me being a boy as a bad thing. I think i wanted to be a girl but didn't view myself as one. It wasn't until i got my period that i fully believed i was genetically female. Also, sometimes i wonder if i was a hermaphrodite. I would understand if my parents hid this information from me as they are very conservative. As a kid i couldn't relate to other girls and in my more recent years I've seen myself as not enough of a girl, like too inadequate to be one.   

I've always felt alienated from other girls/girl stereotypes. I've never fully understood makeup or fashion, and i often feel insecure about my femininity. That being said I feel insecure about my masculinity, too. That may sound weird. What I mean is I feel a need to be tougher and reject girlish traits, to obtain respect from others, but primarily men. Female gender roles disgust me and make me feel nauseated at times. I hate them. The small stuff about looking good i like, but don't understand. But the other imposed female roles of inferiority and sexualization make me very upset. I hate them so much. My father had anger issues, and often called me little girl as an insult. this, I think, may have created the pressure I put on myself to reject these roles, as I know in my mind (and i hate to say this, though I know it's just how society has molded me) I really do view women as weaker and inferior, and resent that i am viewed and treated as such.  I don't want people to think about the fact that i'm a female when i'm talking to them. I want to be treated like a man, but not be a man. If i had a penis i'd be miserable, i don't identify as a man. Really, I just don't want to be viewed and treated as a woman, just as a person. I don't want people to think about my gender when they talk to me. I often wish that gender did not exist, and feel that humanity would be so much better if gender just didn't exist. If we still had different biological sexes, but didn't acknowledge it, and just defined people as people, never distinguishing them with genders. 

 I worry that identifying as agender or nonbinary will make it harder to get boys to like me. Im pansexual, but with a strong romantic preference for men. sorry i know this sounds so shitty.

I do feel like I don't have a gender, but at the same time i think maybe i could just choose to identify as a girl. I just don't understand what I am. The more I think about it, the more i really do feel like i don't have a gender. I also remember reading something in the bible that kinda says gender isn't real, which validates it more for my kind of religious self. I see other kids my age (pretty much all biologically female) who are trans, typically to identify as boys or nonbinary. Anyways, i see these kids, and I feel like they haven't researched it at all, and that it may be the result of internalized sexism, which i regretfully experience. (We are sophomores in hs) I don't want to be like these kids. I want to just know what i am so i can carry on. The teenage years seem kinda crucial into developing into who you are, and i don't wanna squander them by not knowing who i am. 

I also have done this thing for a while where in my head i refer to myself as my parent‚Äôs son. I am very quiet and distant around them, and i feel like they are currently disappointed that i'm so abnormal. that i'm not just a regular girl. I often feel inadequate and ashamed for not being able to just be a regular girl. 

So uh, to restate some points: i feel different from girls, like im not good enough to be one of them. At the same time, i often resent being viewed as a girl, i sometimes view them as inferior and don't like being lumped in with them. Im not uncomfortable with my body. Im good with having boobs, but i like the idea of binding them down occasionally. I view the word girl as a compliment or an insult, depending on the context. If it's a hot person, it's a compliment. Like they‚Äôre pretending i'm better than i actually am. If it's my parents or a teacher i really respect, it feels demeaning, even wrong and rude. 

I‚Äôd like any advice, please tell me what you think.  I just want to know who I am, or steps I could take towards figuring it out. Gender therapy isn't an option for me, my religious conservative parents would never let me, and freak out about me even considering it. So please, any input is appreciated. also im really sorry i feel like i sound like huge sexist jerk by saying all this stuff.

I feel it in a bad way, like i'm not good enough to be a girl. \nWhen i was young i didn't entirely believe i was a girl, i felt alienated from them but saw the possibility of me being a boy as a bad thing. I think i wanted to be a girl but didn't view myself as one. It wasn't until i got my period that i fully believed i was genetically female. Also, sometimes i wonder if i was a hermaphrodite. I would understand if my parents hid this information from me as they are very conservative. As a kid i couldn't relate to other girls and in my more recent years I've seen myself as not enough of a girl, like too inadequate to be one.   \n\nI've always felt alienated from other girls/girl stereotypes. I've never fully understood makeup or fashion, and i often feel insecure about my femininity. That being said I feel insecure about my masculinity, too. That may sound weird. What I mean is I feel a need to be tougher and reject girlish traits, to obtain respect from others, but primarily men. Female gender roles disgust me and make me feel nauseated at times. I hate them. The small stuff about looking good i like, but don't understand. But the other imposed female roles of inferiority and sexualization make me very upset. I hate them so much. My father had anger issues, and often called me little girl as an insult. this, I think, may have created the pressure I put on myself to reject these roles, as I know in my mind (and i hate to say this, though I know it's just how society has molded me) I really do view women as weaker and inferior, and resent that i am viewed and treated as such.  I don't want people to think about the fact that i'm a female when i'm talking to them. I want to be treated like a man, but not be a man. If i had a penis i'd be miserable, i don't identify as a man. Really, I just don't want to be viewed and treated as a woman, just as a person. I don't want people to think about my gender when they talk to me. I often wish that gender did not exist, and feel that humanity would be so much better if gender just didn't exist. If we still had different biological sexes, but didn't acknowledge it, and just defined people as people, never distinguishing them with genders. \n\n I worry that identifying as agender or nonbinary will make it harder to get boys to like me. Im pansexual, but with a strong romantic preference for men. sorry i know this sounds so shitty.\n\nI do feel like I don't have a gender, but at the same time i think maybe i could just choose to identify as a girl. I just don't understand what I am. The more I think about it, the more i really do feel like i don't have a gender.

I'm a binary guy but fully supportive of NB folks. My partner's gender is very fluid, on the other hand, and I'm having trouble showing support. Not because I don't want to be, but because I don't know how and when I ask my partner is not sure. My attempts to be supportive usually result in arguments and frustration. I obviously have no idea how to show support and am screwing up all over the place, so I need guidance. 

Sometimes their presentation is very femme, sometimes andro, never really ""masculine."" They identify as male most of the time but other times say they don't care or don't really have an opinion on what they are. I've asked before if any specific gender identity matches up, so I can research that and get a better idea as my partner more or less just shrugs when I ask about it and doesn't know how to put it into words, but they don't like any of the terms like pangender/bigender/agender/etc. because they don't care for labels. I'm still holding out hope they'll find a label they do like because then I would be able to read and figure out how they feel; even after a few years they don't know how to explain. Even when I ask if they're nonbinary the response is either ""yes,"" ""probably"" or ""nah.""

For example, I took my partner to the mall to get some new clothes as they had lost some weight and wanted a reward. They got all ""women's"" clothes. When I complimented their picks and said they were very nice, they got quiet and sort of shut down. In the car on the way home, they said they were worried I wanted them to ""stay a woman"" because I thought the clothes they picked out were nice and hadn't encouraged them to get ""men's"" clothes. I reassured them that that was not at all the case, and that I thought they looked nice in everything they wear.

Fast-forward to a shopping trip a couple of weeks after that. Partner said they wanted to get some tank tops. I had to go to the ""men's"" section anyway so I picked up a pack there. I showed them to my partner and asked if they were good. Their eyes narrowed and he said ""why would you want me to get men's tanks?"" I was a little bewildered since just before that they had been upset with me for NOT suggesting masc clothes, and this was my attempt to show support for their fluidity. I dropped it and got them ""women's"" tanks instead, but they were irritated about it for the rest of the day.

I guess I just don't know how to show support to someone who is this fluid. What's also complicating things is that because I'm only attracted to my partner and no one else, my sexuality tends to swing towards however they're presenting. According to them I seem ""gayer"" when they're more masc-leaning and ""straighter"" when they're more femme-leaning. Which does make sense and I think that stresses them out. My sexuality is as fluid as their gender. On the other hand my gender is not fluid at all, and their sexuality isn't fluid at all either, so I think that lends to us having trouble understanding each other.

I'm Jeremy, I run a Discord server for trans/gender non-conforming individuals. You might be thinking ""Well, there are a lot of trans servers. What makes this one different?"". I think our trans server stands out because we're all very welcoming and eager to add new friends into the fold. We accept anyone regardless of gender identity, progress in transition, or presentation. 

We have a lot of channels set up to discuss various topics! Many of us are avid gamers and our server even has it's own Minecraft (Peaceful/Vanilla) server to play on. 

On top of the channels to discuss everyday topics or niche interests, we also have support channels. Many of our members are willing to open their ears to you or possibly even assist you with an issue you may have. Of course, we also have rooms for your specific gender identity (transfemme, transmasc, non-binary). 

We currently have more younger members than older ones and we'd love some older trans people. &lt;3

If you don't know what Discord is, check out https://discordapp.com/ . Discord is a voice and text chat program a bit like skype typically geared towards gamers but that's definitely not it's only use. People have servers set up from topics varying from trans servers to servers for TV shows.

So, my first question: I'll have until January 23 before I'm back in classes and living that student life, but I'll need to fly from Orlando to Chicago on January 10. I can pack minimally, or keep everything in a roll-on suitcase, whatever is best. How late do you think I can get the surgery and still be okay to travel? Anywhere before December 29/30 gets really tricky because I have family coming to the US from Europe and we never see them, so I need to be around‚Ä¶but I've heard 2-3 weeks is standard before returning to a desk job, so I'm really pushing it. Winter break is the only time before summer 2018 when I can get the surgery without missing weeks of school, and I want to be fully recovered by summer because my sister is getting married. I have a very important meeting on the morning of January 11, 2018 that will last about an hour, but I'll just be sitting there. Thoughts?

Second question: My full legal name is Caroline. I've been going by Cara for 5 years, but as I feel more masculine I start to feel like Cara is too feminine. I've been playing with Chase as a nickname for Charles, since Charles is how my parents came up with Caroline (Charles is a family name). But Charles is super masculine and Chase is decently masculine, and I'm not sure if I want to go through the hassle of asking everyone to call me a different name. A few people have been calling me Chase at my request, and I really like it. My question is, which name strikes you as more gender-neutral: Cara, or Chase?

I welcome your honest thoughts. Just typing up my top surgery woes is making me anxious, but I have to make it work somehow. Thanks for listening.

(EDIT: I cross-posted in /r/ftm and someone asked when my winter break started, thinking I could get the surgery earlier, which isn't something I'd considered. My break could begin as early as December 18 or as late as December 21, depending on when my finals are.

122,2017-07-26 04:39:34,6pls42,9,17,"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm new here, but I‚Äôm still not quite sure if I belong.

Growing up, my parents encouraged me to develop my individuality from a very young age. I pursued whatever interested me, whether it conformed to traditional gender roles or not. I had a vague impression that some things were ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù to me because I was a girl, but my gender didn‚Äôt influence the way I saw myself for the most part.

When I was seven, my parents and I moved to another country, and the culture shock, homesickness, and stress of moving made me very insecure. I began behaving and presenting very femininely in order to ward off my poor self esteem and negative body image.¬†

Many things changed while we were gone, and once we returned home, I felt out of place once more. I wanted to be graceful and elegant, but I wore baggy, androgynous clothing in a futile attempt to conceal my insecurities. I wanted my body to develop in a feminine manner, but once it did, I was too awkward to talk to my parents about it, and they were too awkward to talk to me either. Consequently, I began to associate my female anatomy with shame, secrecy, and distress, feelings which persist years later.¬†

I met my girlfriend (who‚Äôs MtF) when we were fourteen. Before she began transitioning, I automatically took the submissive, traditionally feminine role in our relationship, but now I naturally gravitate towards a more masculine role. I realize that not all relationships require the traditional masculine-feminine dynamic, and ours certainly doesn‚Äôt conform to ‚Äútraditional‚Äù standards. Yet, her transition prompted me to reevaluate my identity, and I‚Äôm beginning to realize how many parts of myself don‚Äôt exactly fit within the gender binary: partaking in ultrafeminine things like putting on makeup induce a feeling of intense wrongness that borders on dysphoria; I dress androgynously as much as I can, and I prefer to dress as male characters for Halloween/ComicCon; and although I enjoy working with little kids, the notion of my own potential maternity seems strangely foreign and wrong.¬†

I know that I‚Äôm not a trans man, and I‚Äôm fairly sure that I don‚Äôt quite count as a cis woman. I get a warm, fuzzy feeling whenever I think of myself as a nonbinary person. It just feels somehow *right*. Yet, I fear that I don‚Äôt fulfill many of the traits associated with nonbinary identities either. I don‚Äôt mind having a feminine body, and I don‚Äôt expect that I will ever want to pursue a medical transition in any capacity. Female pronouns don‚Äôt bother me, although I mostly use them for convenience rather than because I feel some profound connection to them. My name is quite feminine, and I don't want to change it either. Most troubling, I still have severe anxiety and self esteem problems, and I fear this might be just another coping mechanism. I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if I actually belong in the nonbinary community, or I‚Äôm just a confused cis person who‚Äôs trying to be more ‚Äúspecial‚Äù than they actually are.¬†

I'll be going to university in another country soon, so I'll have the opportunity to change the way people perceive me, and I'm not sure how I want to present. I'll likely still dress androgynously, but should I actually come out to people there if I'm still not sure? I don't know. 

I‚Äôve told my girlfriend and one of my closest friends about my concerns, and they‚Äôre both immensely supportive and understanding.I‚Äôm immensely grateful to have such a wonderful support system, but frankly all this is still somewhat overwhelming. I realize that I need more time for self-reflection, but I hope that perhaps someone here can help me make sense of everything that‚Äôs going through my head.¬†

Thank you so much for reading this. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs so long. If nothing else, I found it helpful to write everything down.

I've identified as non-binary for a good while now, and overall it has served me well. I don't see myself as a transgender man, or a cis woman, so it's the closest way to label what I feel. However, ever since I've come onto this realization, I've been finding it harder and harder to tell people that I am non-binary. It's also something I don't bring up at all until someone asks me.

Because of this, I've learned to deal with being misgendered, and the dysphoria it brings. I don't get mad or upset at people for doing this given that it's my own burden to deal with. Regardless, it does hurt. And it's always a challenge for me to come out and tell them about my identity.

I'm convinced that my reason for doing this to myself is because over last few years I feel like the term has become a joke to most people. I'm embarrassed that I'm like this. I wake up so many mornings and just ask myself why can't I be in one of the binaries? I tried for a time to go as trans and fell into a deep depression. And even now that I know I'm NB, I'm still convinced that no one takes me seriously. That they just see some special snowflake who's trying to make up for a lack of personality. But that's not the case at all...

Just as well, I can never vent to my friends who are also NB or transgender. Those who are NB are usually very feminine (I guess I fit more with masculine but I don't ever see that myself) and are okay with the things I'm uncomfortable with. And I feel like I have no right to complain to trans people because they have to go through so much more than I do. So I've never really had a person to talk to about all of this.

I hate being this confused and frustrated with myself all the time. I want to be normal, or at the very least fit into a binary that people understand. But I can't... I tried and I don't want to do that to myself again. 

Is there anyone out there who feels as though they never get taken seriously for their identity? What ways can I over come this feeling and just accept myself?

7,2017-07-05 13:19:05,6ldyh5,4,31,"It was on a late summer day of August 2012 when it happened. I had been pulled in for a visit to a step-relative at the flip side of my country together with my mother and sister, a visit I really did not want to do, but was coaxed in to doing it anyways. Oh well, I thought, it'll only be the weekend. And besides, I would be bringing my laptop with me that would serve as my distraction. Off I went.

At the time I was a lost, lost person. The little I knew about myself was hampered by a life-long struggle against insecurity and anxiety. Oh, the anxiety was a mess. I never got any proper, ""official"" help for it (which consequently built up as anger inside me). High school was about to end, too, and the pressure to figure your life out, so quickly, was overwhelming. I dealt with this by being my true self, online. It included pretending to be a woman a few times. Unbeknownst to me, it was the perfect set-up for a meltdown.

It happened during the visit. One of the top posts of /r/lgbt of that day appeared on my front page. It was a drawing of various gendered people promoting love and kindness. It led me to /r/asktransgender. I'm sure, if brains could make noises, it would do a loud click with gears rotating shortly after. My first reaction then was, ""Wait, you are allowed to do this?!"" - turns out, yeah, you are.

It shattered a lot of my self-imposed limits. It wasn't even just about the gender, but the concept of taking control of your own life. To experiment and try things out. To make your own choices. It just happened to be about gender this time. It felt like the only open road I could go on to explore myself. So, I did.

It inevitably messed my life up in bad and good ways. My high school was delayed a year. My mental state did a complete meltdown. I changed identity and dropped everyone I knew. But, on the flip side: I became myself, if only with tiny steps. From hormones and from experience. The initial turbulent years could've gone so much more smoother, but it gave me a solid base that I can't set a price tag on.

My parents initially denied my ""phase"". The gender diagnosis didn't arrive until *three* years later after I had applied for help. And it was only then when they suspected I had a problem other than with gender identity. Last year I got a diagnosis in the autistic spectrum and had legal rights to get help for it. I also got an official prescription for hormones. So there's that.

I also kept doubting whether if I was ""trans enough"", seeing as I never felt an overwhelming feeling of being a woman. I never had the typical history of a transgender person, and I never thought about going further than hormones. This led me to try, over and over, to be more female than I actually felt.

I had been pulled in for a visit to a step-relative at the flip side of my country together with my mother and sister, a visit I really did not want to do, but was coaxed in to doing it anyways. Oh well, I thought, it\'ll only be the weekend. And besides, I would be bringing my laptop with me that would serve as my distraction. Off I went.\n\nAt the time I was a lost, lost person. The little I knew about myself was hampered by a life-long struggle against insecurity and anxiety. Oh, the anxiety was a mess. I never got any proper, ""official"" help for it (which consequently built up as anger inside me). High school was about to end, too, and the pressure to figure your life out, so quickly, was overwhelming. I dealt with this by being my true self, online. It included pretending to be a woman a few times. Unbeknownst to me, it was the perfect set-up for a meltdown.\n\nIt happened during the visit. One of the top posts of /r/lgbt of that day appeared on my front page. It was a drawing of various gendered people promoting love and kindness. It led me to /r/asktransgender. I\'m sure, if brains could make noises, it would do a loud click with gears rotating shortly after. My first reaction then was, ""Wait, you are allowed to do this?!"" - turns out, yeah, you are.\n\nIt shattered a lot of my self-imposed limits. It wasn\'t even just about the gender, but the concept of taking control of your own life. To experiment and try things out. To make your own choices. It just happened to be about gender this time. It felt like the only open road I could go on to explore myself. So, I did.\n\nIt inevitably messed my life up in bad and good ways. My high school was delayed a year. My mental state did a complete meltdown. I changed identity and dropped everyone I knew. But, on the flip side: I became myself, if only with tiny steps. From hormones and from experience. The initial turbulent years could\'ve gone so much more smoother, but it gave me a solid base that I can\'t set a price tag on.\n\nMy parents initially denied my ""phase"". The gender diagnosis didn\'t arrive until *three* years later after I had applied for help. And it was only then when they suspected I had a problem other than with gender identity. Last year I got a diagnosis in the autistic spectrum and had legal rights to get help for it. I also got an official prescription for hormones. So there\'s that.\n\nI also kept doubting whether if I was ""trans enough"", seeing as I never felt an overwhelming feeling of being a woman. I never had the typical history of a transgender person, and I never thought about going further than hormones. This led me to try, over and over, to be more female than I actually felt.\n\nI just waited, waited, and waited for the turbulent years to be over. And eventually, it did. I no longer feel obligated to pick either female, or male. I feel comfortable going with just hormones, with an androgynous voice, and with a feminine appearance. I feel secure in myself, not just my gender but with everything, and that really is a wonderful feeling.\n\nI guess I\'m writing all of this as a reflective piece for myself, and for all of you.

Normally, I don't get along with NP's. Or male Providers. But my initial visits with Klarberg were great. I felt like he listened to me and didn't judge me, as I was nervous and scared about coming out, and I was dealing with the end of a relationship that had lasted a year. I was actually able to start hormones fairly quickly. 

But after being bumped up from 2mg of estradiol to 4mg per day, things changed. When he bumped me up to 6mg he seemed hesitant. I told him that I had been experiencing cramps and the full range of Period Symptomes (bloating, swollen breasts, intestinal distress, period shits, moodiness, some body aches... the standard for a period, although no bleeding obviously.) Instead of listening to me, he dismissed what I was saying as ""impossible"", yet a good portion of Trans women do experience some of these symptoms every month at a pretty regular time. (Information that I only learned AFTER I started dealing with it and my friend pointed out that my complaints sounded exactly like her period. )

My questions of ""Ok, if it's not that, then what is it?"" Went in one ear and out the other. He refused to even explore the possibility that there might be other causes for these symptoms, instead labeling it as ""a placebo effect"". Dude, up until I had these symptoms, I didn't even know that this could happen. As it stands, I've had period symptoms regularly. Every 4 weeks, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 days. 

Then yesterday, he constantly seemed to be wanting to get out of the room. I felt like I was being judged by him, I felt like he wasn't listening to me at all. He started talking about ""Now that your breasts have come in some, I think we should lower your estrogen some. Back down to the 4mg per day."" Ummm... excuse Me?! I was hoping I could get bumped up again. ""Why? What are you hoping that will accomplish?"" I'm not kidding. That is a direct quote. 

Me: ""umm... a more feminine body? Look, I've gotten some ass, and some hips, and some breasts. Yay. But lowering my estrogen at this point will reduce the fat distribution in my ass and legs, which is a huge point of dysphoria for me. It's also going to pretty much halt the breast growth I've had up until now. I have a pretty solid understanding of how this works. Obviously I'm not stupid, I can read my medical charts without a problem. I do not need or want any medical terminology to be dumbed down to layman's terms.""

Klarberg: ""well, I don't see a reason to bump you up, but I'll leave you at your 6mg per day for now."" He quickly left after that.

Since then, I've made sure that I'm being switched to a different provider within the clinic, one that I've heard only wonderful things about from the trans community. Turns out, Klarberg is like this a lot. It seems to be something that is brought up about him every time his name comes up in the trans community in Houston. 

I'm just SO ticked off. When I called to schedule with a different provider they tried to railroad me in with Klarberg again. I may have been a bit of a bitch about it and told them there was no way in hell that I was going to deal with Klarberg again, that I needed a provider who actually listens to their patients instead of being dismissive.

Does anyone else have to justify their reason for wanting to be bumped up to the next stage of hormones? Also, Klarberg was refusing to give me Progesterone.

Context: My dad is generally republican/conservative and has a history of bigoted views. Lately, that's been improving, especially after I've come out to my family as a gay transman, but he still has difficulty completely accepting gay male intimacy/sex, and other things that are not conventional views of masculinity. Him, my mom and my sister are all supportive, but I can't help but feel extremely frustrated and even angry when things like this come up.

He mentioned something about ""trans men"" ""trying too hard"", and I asked ""trans men or trans *women*?""
He was of course talking about trans women. I explained that MTFs are trans *women*, and I am a trans *man*.
He said it's ""confusing"", to which I responded: ""it's only confusing because you don't see them as real women or men.""
Then he began to say ""well you're a woman-""
I'M NOT A WOMAN. We've been over this. They've known for well over a year. Holy shit, I don't understand why this concept is so difficult to grasp. Trans women are real women. Trans men are real men. Why the hell would they be referred to as trans ""men"" if they are trying so hard to escape being seen as male, and vice versa?

This kind of half-assedness is unhelpful to say the least. I don't call that support. I call it tolerance, but with their own ignorant views still in place. God damn it.|

I changed my name... a few times, till I found the one that was right. I felt happier than I ever had. 
I talked to Dr.s and told them what I felt, I went and talked to them for years. Finally I was able to start hormones to change my body to the appearance I felt inside.

I was born and raised in a small Idaho town. Its a lot of things, the college makes it a bit of a liberal oasis, the Idaho gives it a worrying background noise of repressed conservatism, the meth keeps things interesting. I hope to leave soon. I love it here but I know to much about it. Its hard to separate what parts I love and hate because they all blur together under the fog of familiarity. I hope to move to Oregon soon. I love it there and it seems safer. I've known I felt like a girl since I was very small. I've known what being transgender meant since i was about the same age. I loved feeling like a girl but I hated feeling trans. Being a girl felt comfortable, being trans felt like I was signing a contract to be hated. I hate being hated. So I decided to live in my own head and call it good. It worked. lying to the world was easier than lying to myself. I honestly just kept putting it off. Then all of a sudden I was 19, hated myself, and couldn't think of anything that would make me feel better. So I came out as trans to my parents and then hated myself more. I don't want to be trans. Still don't. It would be so convenient to be a white dude. I got good at lying to people. I'm really good at it. People tell me I'm a bad liar. I agree with them. I cant remember how I felt about being a liar or being trans. I think I wished I didn't feel anything. Not feeling anything would be so convenient. I have a hard time talking about myself. What I want, what I think about things. I try to give non answers. It felt more honest because I thought that no one would understand what I wanted, so I had to try to get at what I was saying without actually saying it. Now the non answers just happen and I cant seem to find how I feel about things sometimes. A lot of the time. Maybe not that often. It feels like I write so much differently than I talk because I write in my head. I didn't speak in my head. I lived in my head and my voice was to lie and protect myself. Now when I talk I don't hear myself. I just hear a tool that I used for lies. And when I try to say how I feel it still feels like a lie because the voice in my head isn't speaking. I loved acting. It felt so real, I was doing the same things I would be doing anyway, putting on faces, making the emotions real because they have to be real to make the lie work. But it was real because the lies moved into the background, into the setting, into the play. Being on stage was beautiful because it was all lies. And I already knew how to tell beautiful lies. I'm scared of lying to myself. I'm not really scared of anything else. What else is there to fear? even the fear of being wrong about my transition is smaller than that. Just a small feature on a larger landscape of terror. But when I tell myself that i feel like a girl, that convenience doesn't mean happiness, and that the only thing required to be honest is to try, I don't feel afraid. And although calling myself a boy everyday for the purposes of convenience comes easily. Saying I'm a boy is as easy a screaming. I can never complete the thought. And when I try to I get so... well i think i'm afraid. And its the thought that counts right? I just wish i could think out loud. When I was in 6th grade I was on a field trip, they called me a girl. And I asked them to stop. And it hurt so much. And then they kept calling me a girl, and I cant remember how I felt about it, but trying to feel bad about it felt so... inconvenient. And I remember wanting to tell them that it was fine they could keep doing it. But I just couldn't find the voice.

I was a bit awkward and didn't really have many friends to sit with, so when I would occasionally run into people that were freshmen with me in the School of Drama, I would ask if I could sit with them.

I'm not good enough that anyone would ever accept me as a girl nor if I never came out. 

I'm not going to be able to go on. I can't keep sleeping on the floor renting out a stranger's basement hoping I can save money to fix my life. I am going to lose my most reliable job soon because I'm losing focus and getting sluggish because I can't stop hating myself and what's happening to me.

My ex and former best friend either doesn't accept that I'm trans or she doesn't care. I'm not good enough for her to see me as one of her trans friends. I can't even use facebook with my preferred name because every time I try to make an account to talk to trans groups I keep getting taken down because it knows I'm the same person who already made an account on my deadname years ago.

I'm never going to be able to afford treatment, surgery, cosmetics, or even cute clothes or make up. I'm so ashamed to ever show myself in public and I'm scared to talk to anyone who was my friend. 

I hate that my adopted parents would charge me a thousand dollars a month to sleep in a storage closet because they can't stand me even though they'll go out of their way to leer at me and touch me and watch me wherever I go. I hate that I have dissociative identity and one of my personalities keeps thinking I should try to be a man. I hate having intrusive compulsive thoughts that make me not able to stop thinking about how ugly and unacceptable i am to my former best friend.

I hate that I never told her that I wanted to be a woman for her all those years ago while I was still in school. I hate that I can't afford any mental help anymore, I wish I was at least still on risperdol even though it wasn't working so maybe I could develop breast tissue for a side effect.

I hate everyone thinking that I am trying to be a man and using anything girly about me as an insult. I hate being told I would look handsome with short hair. I hate that my roommates I'm trying to make peace with don't want me shaving my body hair and think that if we're going to help each other with the shit situation we're all in they should view me as their son. I hate my voice and I hate that no one ever will want me to sing or read to them. 

I can't stand feeling unsafe and unacceptable more from transwomen than even people like my relatives who just hate me blindly. I hate that I'll never bee good enough, that I'll never beautiful, and I could never have a child. I hate that my best friend is just giving away anything that was ever special to me because she's in love with other girls and can't see me as one. I hate that even if she would look at me again she'd see me as a boy being weak and slutty trying to look like a girl. I hate that there's nowhere I can be at peace anymore and no one I can trust. I hate that even if I was pretending to be a man my old friends are too busy to listen to me on anything and my co-workers all think I'm queer. I hate that I'd be 100% certain to lose my job if I ever came out to them because it's a christian office. I hate that all of my trans friends I did make no longer have interest in me because treating someone who looks like me with a boy's name online the same way that they treated me before is just weird. 

Even if a miracle happened and I was able to afford treatment to look exactly like I wanted and calm my mind and get all the pretty clothes I wanted, no one would ever be able to see me for me anymore. I've been completely abandoned by everyone I love because I can't act normal and I don't feel right and they never actually did love me in the past either, I was just way over attached to common kindness. 

I can't keep crying every night and feeling so disgusting and filthy and fearing what it means that I have the bad parts of having a male body but nothing anyone ever holds of value in men, I hate hearing her talk about how awful males are and knowing she's including me but excluding the trans girls she loves now. I hate feeling like nothing I say or do can be trusted because of my mental problems and that no one would stay with me even just for fun. 

I hate that it will never fair to any of the rest of you for someone like me to identify as a trans girl because it would make people associate being trans with someone as ugly and messed up and unacceptable as me. I hate that I feel like I'm guilt tripping everyone whenever I try to talk about any of my problems. I hate that there's no easy way for me to just die, I hate that no one will notice if I disappeared they'd just realize they're a lot happier without me around.  I've lost everything, I never had much but at least I had an illusion that I was okay and had love once. I still love her so much but she barely wants to be friends with me anymore and there's nothing I can do to change my situation or help anybody.

My name is Isa, I'm 27, mtf, living with my cis partner in Seattle, and with my 1-year-into-transition and not-unrelated anxiety, I find it hard to meet new people here--surprise surprise! So I guess I'm posting this and joining the forum because I'm hoping to make some new friends and forge some connections in the trans community here in Seattle.

Stuff I like: going to shows at Kremwerk, rewatching Always Sunny/King of the Hill until I die, gradually stealing my partner's extensive makeup collection, board games (Dominion, 7 Wonders, tabletops aplenty), Stardew Valley (and other video games probably), typical outdoorsy BS like hiking and canoeing, listening to and emulating Danny Brown records, leaving lipstick on every glass at snooty cocktail bars (especially ones pretending to be speakeasies), and finding all the Taiwanese food in town in order to relive that one time I went there.

I'm putting this all out there to be like, HI!, but also to say that I would love to do any or all of the above with fellow trans folx in Seattle. I know Ingersoll does weekly meetups, and that places like Raygun Lounge do dedicated queer grrl nights, and I even volunteered for Trans Pride this year--but all that stuff is hard for me to go to when I don't know anyone and don't know what I'm getting myself into.

I've been seeing this plastered all up and down my facebook feed and of course ive gone anywhere from seeing arguments about the cost, mental illness, surgeries and bigotry. Its pretty intense out there currently.

But I've got a few points of my own to make, and I'm a tad confused. 

One; I don't think Trumps Trans Ban is about money.

Why? Let's have a look at some figures. In an analysis, wide and varying numbers of the VA budget have been shown to be several numbers viagara and erectile dysfunction - some 40 million and 80 million respectively. But, the cost of transgender health provision will be somewhere in the figures of 2.5 million to 8.5 million per year - disrupting a negligible amount of a military budget that is twice the combined power of many countries after it.

But we aren't talking just about surgery here, we are talking about HRT aswell - testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, spironolactone. Mostly, these drugs costs about $60/month in australia - more in the US due to non public health care. But that shouldn't alarm me more than the drinking habits of soldiers.

In december 2016, it was estimated in a survey that 43% of active duty members were binge drinkers - 67% of those were between 17-25. How much would binge drinking cost the US military? What would be the medical bill for young testosterone pumped men going out and finding trouble on a weekend? Well, it turns out that on average 11,982 service members (that's nearly the full amount of the 15,500 trans members in the US military) need to undergo alcohol reeducation a year- but are we looking at banning alcohol or discharging those members? Where is the storm about alcohol? Why isn't that being banned? How much is the US government paying for soldiers to drink every weekend? Why is binge drinking a more acceptable use of payment than allowing soldiers to purchase hormone replacement therapy? 

Two; Since when, have i been more at risk to be a danger behind a gun because I'm trans?

3 people a day. 3 people a day. Thats the current statistic for police shootings in america - alright, but lets straighten that out; there's no saying how many are criminals and how many are justified and etc etc.  And also, thankyou to our men and women keeping us safe - but seriously, apart from Kristin Beck, who was a SEAL that took part in the Bin Laden raid (god she is a national treasure) how many times do we hear about a trans person shooting someone? Its the same thing with the bathroom problem; there are roughly 700,000 transgender Americans- if being transgender puts the person in the wake of being a pervert, a pedophile, a sex criminal, why aren't we hearing about trans people abusing people in bathrooms? Why isnt it a larger issue? Where are all the headlines about people being assaulted in bathrooms by trans people? Where are they?

Hint; they arent there - trans people are like spiders. We are more afraid of cis people than they are of us. Its the same thing with mental illness and being trans; there is no link between pedophilia, sex crime and mental illness and being transgender. None.

Three; And why is wanting medical treatment an issue anyway? 

Lets think about this  - because this is something im seeing; people dont want me in the military because they are worried that the fact i want to get SRS means im obviously very, very unstable. 

No. The reason i want to get SRS is to be rid of an appendage that doesnt suit my body anymore- on anti androgens, it becomes more difficult to achieve and maintain an errection. Your penis may or may not become something of a useless appendage, which is reason enough to have it surgically altered, not counting dysphoria. 

And no; i actually cant be under the influence of mental incapacity when i elect for SRS. Why? Because i have to visit a psychiatrist who had to assess that i am under no mental duress that prevents me from thinking clearly about the decision and preventing it from being an informed and rational medical choice. 

Four; Being transgender isnt a social experiment. 

Neither is gay. Or black. Or smart. Or allowing the infantry to mix with the non apes or whatever. Let's put it this way; if trans people can use the bathroom of their choice, there won't need to be excessive bathroom schemes - again; most trans people are downright terrified of cis people. We seriously fucking are. We will avoid public bathrooms all together most of the time. All we want; to go use the bathroom in peace and not be noticed doing so. Its fucking terrifying. Please, for the love of god just ignore us.


Its bedazzled and really thrown me - i really dont get it; why do people hate me so much? What have i literally done to make people so fucking outraged by my existence? What have any of my brothers and sisters done to deserve this? 

I am NOT a pervert. I am NOT a pedophile, a basket case or anything else - im no more a threat to society than say, an egomaniac in control of the most powerful country on earth.

Dr. Dhejne has [**emphatically denounced**](http://transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) these kinds of misrepresentation of her work. Her study found only that trans people who transition *prior to 1989* had slightly higher rates of suicide attempts than the general public (but still far lower than pre-transition levels), and that trans people post-transition have slightly higher rates of needing mental health services. The study specifically identified abuse and discrimination as the cause of these differences.

Since the interview in which she spelled out why these misrepresentations of her work are wrong is from The TransAdvocate, I've seen people claim the source isn't valid and the interview is fraudulent.

I think I pass most of the time, even given my size. Im 6ft tall, which in itself isnt to bad,  but my frame is on the large size. 
But what really gets to me is that i cant seem to get my voice to sound natural. I just sound like a super faggy fem gay guy. I think it sounds to forced. 

Something I do get a lot is that 'I feel bad for you, sympathy look'. You know the one, when they realize you are trans so they just feel bad for you. I have never has anyone abuse me or get angry at me irl. The worst i have gotten is a dirty look. 
Online is a different story, if i use my voice in game chats it is very rare that i dont get abused.

I have been struggling with dysphoria a lot recently and had a suicide attempt 1.5 months ago. 
I dont know what to do. I've considered getting voice surgery but when i mention it to my friends they all say i dont need it your voice is fine.

I posted here last year sometime about my feelings on my gender (or lack thereof), and have continued to explore my own gender identity since. I have also  met my wonderful girlfriend who I feel very comfortable discussing my feelings with which has really helped.

I am AFAB, and currently identify as gay, but I always express myself in a very masculine way, I dress almost exclusively in men's clothes and have short hair as it's how I feel most comfortable. I have large breasts but always wear sports bras as I am uncomfortable with them but can't afford a good binder yet. I want to present as masculine as possible, but I don't feel trans, or at least I don't think I do. What all this boils down to is that I don't feel like a woman, and I am certain at this point that I do not fall into a binary gender category. 

I want to find the right description for me, just something that feels comfortable and natural, as I really would like to start coming out (again!) to friends and family. Currently I'm thinking of something like non-binary, genderqueer, or agender. So to help me in this process, would you guys mind telling me what description(s) you personally use, and why you identify with them?

I had said f it.  With my girls behind me. I said f it and went to Sephora to purchase foundation in person.  I said f the shame.  F the past 36 years.  I knew that I would need a color match.  I knew that I was walking in at the semi middle busiest time of the store.  I knew that it was the mall so there would be teens mulling about.  I said f it.  I had my pears.

In the middle of the store in front of a makeup battlestation I stood waiting for a sublime creature, Bailey, to use her magic and pick out a shade to match my skin.  My nerves had disappeared as I wanted this.  Telling her I currently used Loreal Perfect Match N3 she could understand what extra coverage I wanted.  Yielding her skin scanner, she scanned my cheek, neck and forehead, determined my skin tone and nonchalantly flicked through a tablet for matching products - MUFE just like Amy's.  She applied one swatch on my left cheek, an alternate shade on my right.  She disappeared into the aisle to grab another shade, cleaned my face, applied to left cheek again, and forehead and neck, asked co-worker to confirm...  She apologized a couple of times at how long it was taking as she wanted a good match -- I did too.  

In between, patiently waiting I chatted with my girls via the ether, the shoulders I leaned on -- as giddy as I was and wanting to know what was happening.  The other customers went about their business.  Bailey had me take a mirror AND WALK AROUND THE STORE to see how the shade looked in different lights.  I did that too because damn it the color did look a little different as I walked.  We had a match.   Bailey asked if I wanted to wear it out and what naturally came out of my mouth (because I wanted to look my best) was that I didn't have any color correcting concealer so I didn't want to.  

There in my hands was a black box, MUFE Matte #53.  Staring at it, it had become a symbol of a face to face exchange between someone (even if I was only in drab) who has been hidden for years with another -- not just talk, an exchange without shame and fear, I backed by wonderful gals hundreds of miles away only connected by ether -- they joking that I now could parade my Sephora bag around the mall -- and I did without shame.  All that and the only negative was, I forgot where I parked.

As I drove home, the wall must have continued falling because neutrality fell around me.  Neither dysphoria nor euphoria was present just a sereneness.  I was in drab and that was ok.

I've gained a lot of confidence the past year and a half as I've gradually come to terms with dysphoria, confusion and the desire to no longer identify as a woman. However, there is still this ridiculous part of me that talks myself out of coming out to certain friends because for the most part, on the outside, I look the same. I do not intend to take testosterone or have top surgery. My appearance, including clothes and haircut, have definitely become increasingly masculine/androgynous over the past two years, and people have definitely suspected a 'shift' of sorts, but if I never opened up to friends, they could still go on for years just seeing me as the girl they've always known. I've begun to go by a new name at work and with new people that I meet. I still use 'she' pronouns because I am read as female and it just draws so much less attention to me, but I have come out to co-workers individually who I feel close to and comfortable with, and those aspects of my social transition have been very validating. Despite my dysphoria, my endless questioning, and my happiness at my social transition so far, I still talk myself out of all of this once every few months and try to shove myself back into the binary, all the while feeling incredibly awkward and disembodied whenever I think of myself as a woman. If anyone has any words of advice for moving towards a healthier place of self-acceptance, I'd greatly appreciate it. Honestly, the doubt and self-invalidation I still subject myself to is more difficult to deal with than any kind of dysphoria I experience in day to day life. I long so desperately to truly say, yes, my gender identity is valid, and wanting to share it with those closest to me is also valid, and I don't need to change my physical body to have the 'right' to share that with other people.

I'm AFAB and have been questioning my gender for years. Earlier this year I realized I thought I was FtM (before, I was just out as a lesbian). However, recently I let myself begin to explore new ideas: Maybe I'm not any gender in particular at all.

Yesterday, something just clicked into place. I know I don't feel female, but I don't necessarily feel male. I just sort of... don't seem to fit anywhere. But then, non binary/genderqueer seems to fit!

Is it okay to wear feminine clothing sometimes as AFAB and still consider myself non binary/genderqueer?

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWQipdwhlcH/

First outfit is from the men's section, the Soffee's running shorts are made of nylon and feel so luxurious, I wish all my clothes were made of nylon! I have switched to mostly nylon undies now mostly men's but expanding to women's too. Wish it had pockets though. Not sure how I feel about the split sides. 

Second outfit is from women's section, I don't know why but so far all the short shorts I have encountered only have key pockets, except for underarmor. The pockets aren't that big but enough to hold my phone. I love the design, it is always nice to have something different from the usual solid color design. I will probably get some more women's underarmor shorts.

I cut an old pair of khakis and jeans, just need to hem the edges to make them mid thigh length. Should be more appropriate for going outside. Might need to get new khaki shorts though because my old ones are so baggy. I prefer tighter clothes now. I wore the jean shorts outside with my mom into a crowded area. I felt rather selfconcious, like out of dozens of people there only like 3 guys were wearing above the knee shorts and only 1 of them had long hair.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWOr1johdff/

I have only been around the yard in my short shorts and I did notice some people passing by staring at me but I also have long hair and a shaggy beard so who knows which part is giving them pause, maybe all of them lol. but the only people who has said anything to me is my family. my mom kept saying stuff like ""wow your shorts are so short."" ""i didn't know they made men's shorts so short."" my cousin asked me why I am wearing girl shorts. and I ignored him. Then my mom attitude changed. ""you should pay more attention and make sure you don't buy the wrong shorts"" I told her I know its womens shorts. and she said ""men should not be wearing women's clothes"" my family has already been giving me shit for wearing leggings and skinny jeans. my mom also keeps pointing out that I have pink socks and pink underwear (despite them being men's boxer briefs). that's the only color that she points out.

I need to get some more vnecks too. most of my tops strangle my neck which is great for winter since it keeps me warm, but feels bad during the summer. I am motivated by price so far mostly buying clothes from marshals and their clothes seem to be mainstream gendered clothes. men's shirts barely any vnecks and all the shorts are 9+ inch inseams. women's shirts lots of vnecks and scoop necks, and almost all their shorts are 2 inch inseams. tempted to get a 2 inch inseam chino/khaki shorts but that will guarantee people staring and vocal disapproval from family. I also checked gap their mens shorts are also all long. but they do have midthigh womens shorts. but pricey though. that's why i am trying out cutting my old pants will have to see if I am okay with the super baggy shorts if not.

So I came out to my wife officially as non binary. I'm not changing my name, but asking to be called by a nickname that feels less gendered to me, and now using they/them pronouns.

Soon I'll send a note to my friends and then I guess eventually I'll come out to my parents?

Though I'm having some feelings about that. Because technically nothing is really different about me. So is it worth putting the stress on my mother? It seems like she's finally over my short hair and androgynous style (I'm AFAB and came out as gay 7 years ago). I'm worried if I come out as NB, I'll stress her out over something that, to me, feels like no big deal. 

I'm not doing HRT yet, and don't know that I ever will. Not getting top surgery yet, but may in the future if I can't get my chest size down by losing weight. So yeah like I said, nothing is really changing about me right now.

Anyways, I went to a friend's house where we did facemasks and makeup with another friend. Sidenote they both talked about some personal stuff and other things you wouldn't tell everyone, so it was nice to know they trusted that much. Honestly I really felt like I was treated like a girlfriend, even though I just sat there and soaked it in, not really able to add anything. Although I wish I looked better than I did, I think I looked my best so far.

So we got lunch, and headed to Ulta, a makeup store. I got gendered correctly the entire time by the employees which was super awesome. My friend even used the right name too without me correcting her except for one instance which is totally fine. It's hard to put into words how affirming it is. I only had one situation that became an issue but it doesn't have anything to do with gender.

I definitely have gained more confidence from this and the first time going out presenting how I want to. I never thought I'd ever have to come out (even if it's only a couple people) yet alone go out in public. I might have even come to the point where I come out to more people but still not sure on that, but that's a whole different story.

56,2017-07-09 06:13:40,6m6066,0,10,"I'm AMAB and not sure exactly what my gender is, so I use genderqueer. I present mostly male, though I wear women's clothes and nail polish and currently have most of my body hair shaved.

I'm polyamorous, and my two main relationships started before I have identified as non-cisgendered. As a result, I can never tell if they see me as anything but a man. If they just love me for me, or really get my gender. I still get misgendered a lot by one of them, but it doesn't really hurt, because she does it semi-ironically, or something. Also, she doesn't do it when it really matters, when I feel vulnerable.

Anyway, I started seeing someone new, and she talks to me in mixed language (much more important in Hebrew, where it's really hard to speak in neutral language). I really appreciated it, and she was basically the first one to show an interest in me, post genderqueer identity, with the way I present and all. Because of this, it was really painful when she misgendered me last night, but not only that, she got angry that I focused on myself.

Basically, she said something about herself, and she felt she was exposing herself and her thoughts, but one of those thoughts was along the lines of ""He's just another guy..."".

I'm a late 20s female, reasonably successful (in terms of career, independence, etc), always struggled with gender identity privately, not talked about it. Not in a ""Oh God, I am in the wrong body"" sort of way. I used to want to be a man when I was younger because it seemed to ""fit"" me better. Heck, maybe it would. But it seems like for me, it's not worth the trouble and considering that I've always been a loner and kind of ""disconnected"" with most people, swapping parts and taking hormones and changing my name wouldn't really alleviate that for me. In fact, it would make my life more difficult and because I don't feel dysphoric, it wouldn't be worth it for me. 

I guess I'm a shoddy female. I don't wear make-up and fuck dresses. I moisturize/wash my face but that's it. I have shorter hair now, something I swore I wouldn't do again and now I *look* more how I feel...and that's confusing. Sometimes I dress up rarely for my boyfriend, because I know he likes it, but day-to-day, it's just the same old t-shirt/jeans/whatever. I used to be really fat and everyone said ""You will change your style when you lose weight."". Well, I did lose weight. My style didn't really change, other than my clothes getting smaller.

When I think of myself, it's just this kind of neutral entity. Sometimes I have dreams about me having a penis or no parts at all.

I'm 23, AFAB and genderqueer/trans-masculine. I'm dating a 24 year old trans girl, and I love her more than anything.

She had a doctors appointment today with a new doctor, one who's willing to start HRT probably very soon. I'm happy for her!

But in all the talk about hormones lately, and transitioning. I've started thinking about my own identity more and how much I honestly hate myself. I've been comfortable identifying as genderqueer/nonbinary for close to 5 years now. I've thought about transitioning, but my dysphoria is about such specific things, I don't think I'll ever be happy either way.

I know for sure most of my physical dysphoria comes from my breasts, I have a binder but would love to get top surgery someday. That's honestly the only thing I'm sure about. I'd like to start hormones, I want a deeper voice and to present more androgynously, or at least be seen as male rather than female. But I'm really bothered by the elongated clit especially. My vagina doesn't give me any dysphoria, I like it and don't want it to change, and I feel if I started T, my clit would grow and I'd just hate it, and as far as I know, that's one of the irreversible effects of testosterone.

83,2017-07-14 15:17:10,6n9o01,5,6,"Hey. Thanks for taking the time to read this. It's probably lame and/or pointless but here's the deal...

I'm 24 years old, AMAB. Even as a kid, I often thought about being a girl. It really appealed to me. I never tried makeup or dressing in feminine clothes, but it's something I never stopped thinking about, even to now. For a while, I thought I might be trans. And I definitely do wish I had been born female. But no, there are definitely times I'm comfortable being a man, and with feeling masculine.

Even so, I'm not at all happy with my body. At times like the one I'm going through now, the dysphoria is unbearable. I catch sight of myself in the mirror, and I recoil in almost tangibly painful disgust. 

I want to be more feminine in general. And I'm not exactly a sterling example of a manly man. I'm a small, soft-spoken nerdy dude. But I was born with a barrel chest and corresponding broad shoulders, with a large, high forehead and terrible, thin hair. I went yesterday to get a haircut that was supposed to be androgynous, and feel like I walked away only looking more masculine. I shave close, often to the point of nicking myself several times, yet the shadow of stubble never seems to go away, even if it feels smooth to the touch.

So... I don't know. What can I do? I have no experience with trying to present as feminine, and so far anything I do just doesn't work. I don't know where to start. I don't even know if it's possible, with how shitty my body is. I'm considering HRT, not to fully transition, but to feminize my body at least. But even that can't fix everything. 

I know this is rambly and likely hard to follow or sympathize with. I'm typing this in the middle of an anxiety attack and I can't even breathe right now.

-----------------------------------------

Hi Family &lt;3

So I'm doing this in an email because even though I'm [AGE], I'm a coward. Plus with things like this, it helps to get it all out at once.

Here goes. I'm coming out again! This time as nonbinary/genderqueer, which is an identity that falls under the transgender umbrella. Whoa buddy. What does that even mean? Here are some links:

[INSERT YOUR PREFERRED LINKS]

The basics are this: Though I was Assigned Female At Birth, I've recently come to terms with the fact that I've never quite felt female. That said, I also don't quite feel male either. Growing up, I didn't know what this meant. I didn't even know it was a thing. Today, in 2017, trans folks are so much more visible than they ever were, and I've learned about all of the possibilities that are out there. Imagine my surprise when suddenly it all clicked, like ""Whoa... that's me!""

I wish I could tell you I was 100% certain about where I stand and who I will eventually become (side note wouldn't it be cool to know this for ANYTHING in life? LOL.) I don't know if I will get any surgeries. I don't know if I will do hormone replacement therapy. Thankfully, I've been seeing a gender therapist for the past few months and will continue to do so, because I'm still learning a lot about myself and what I want! It's all very new but it feels very right.

The most important thing I've learned is that it's CRUCIAL for me to let you in on my journey. The feeling of keeping a secret from you is the worst. I love you so much, and I want you to know what's going on with me and I hope we can all learn together.

Things I know for sure:

- For now, I'd like to keep this between us. Shouldn't be too hard! Brother, I obviously am ok with you telling your family! You can even just show them this email if you want. Eventually, I will be coming out publicly. When I'm ready.

- I'd like to start using the gender-neutral pronouns ""they/them/theirs"". I know this feels grammatically incorrect, but I bet you already use these pronouns in day-to-day conversations, (i.e. someone left their backpack here!, etc). Turns out language is constantly changing and evolving! And Merriam-Webster recognizes gender neutral pronouns as valid! Can you imagine if language never evolved? We'd all be saying ""thee, thou, etc"". Anyway, the more you use the pronouns the more comfortable they'll feel. I know this from experience.

- I'd like to ween everyone off [BIRTH NAME]. It's a beautiful name, but I never felt like it belonged to me. Sorry Mom and Dad :( For now, I'd prefer nicknames like [INSERT NICKNAMES]. I‚Äôll let you know when I decide on the perfect name.

- I am literally the exact same person I always was. I will continue to be a tomboy, have short hair, dress like a 16 year old boy in summer, dress like an old fisherman in winter, get tattoos that you hate, use the F word on the internet, incessantly post photos of my cats on Instagram, etc.

I've also made a preemptive Q&amp;A for some things you may be thinking!!!

But what about that period of time in college that you were SO girly!!

- If I remember correctly, that lasted from age 19-21. That's three years of my life. 1/10 of my time on earth. If you'll remember before that, I was scared to TEARS at the very IDEA of dressing girly. It always felt like a costume I was wearing for other people, never for myself. Plus, after the girly period, I reverted back to my old tomboy ways, dressing more androgynously as time went on, leading me to where I am now. So the ""girly period"" was fun, but I think that contributes to my non-binary-ness! I didn't mind being girly, but who I am now feels better. Which brings me to my next point.

Do you have Gender Dysphoria (the terrible feeling of being uncomfortable in your body)? You seem so happy!

- I recently heard someone say, ""Sometimes it's not about gender dysphoria, but gender euphoria."" Yes, I have always hated my hips and my large chest. But everything else, I'm fine with it. I feel okay in my female body. I'm okay with the fact that I have both feminine and masculine mannerisms. But when I am perceived as androgynous, feel REALLY happy. Think of it this way: Mom, would it make you feel good if someone thought you were a man? NOPE! Dad or [BROTHER], how would it feel if someone thought you were a woman? NO THANKS. But for me, when someone mistakes me for a ""Sir"", or is confused about my gender, I love it. It feels really GOOD. It makes me feel like myself. There you have it: Gender Euphoria!

I'm devastated at the thought of losing my little girl!!

- See above. I'm still me!! In fact, I'll be a better happier version of myself!! Plus, nothing can take away your memories of the little girl you knew! She was so cute, but she's been gone for a while if you think about it. I grew up and out of my pink pajamas over two decades ago, y'know.

Yeah but LEGALLY and BIOLOGICALLY you'll still be female!

Correct. It's possible to be both non-binary and female! Biologically, yes, my SEX is Female. But for me and many others, GENDER is a Spectrum (insert liberal hippy peace sign and read more at the links above). I am non-binary/genderqueer.

Whew. So.

That's all I have for now. I'll let this sink in today, and if I don't hear from you (I hope I do!!!), I'll be FaceTiming each of you tomorrow to check in. I love you so much, more than anything on earth, and I hope you'll continue to love and accept me the same as you always have. You've always been the best, I feel pretty confident that you will. Please prove me right. 
Ôøº
Love,

Your child / sibling (lol, we'll work on that...)

121,2017-07-23 06:35:51,6ozysx,4,1,"I've been entertaining/obsessing over the idea that I might be agender or something along those lines.

Basically, I think gender is a crock.  I don't think the individual ""soul"" or whatever consciousness is has innate gender - Personally, I feel much more like a star or a flame or some kind of abstract musical light-thing than something in the shape of a man or a woman per se.

Growing up (AMAB) I was always skeptical of gender norms, the idea of being able to predict what a person's personality is like from their body.  Like the idea that boys should get a certain kind of happy meal toy and girls another.  What absurdity.  I was always comfortable experimenting at the edges, trying on dresses and stuff like that - before I learned it was a faux pas.  I firmly believe that an individual can ""be"" and ""do"" anything, and should manifest themselves in the most authentic and unique way they can.

Flash forward today and I find myself curiously surrounded by genderqueer folk.  It feels like majority of my friends, crushes, etc. have been queer as balls and that I mesh with them all really well, and I'm down with all the theory and the activism and all that.  Am I just some weird kind of fetishist or douchey ""ally,"" or is there a resonance there based on my own identity?  Or is my social scene completely irrelevant?

If other people are to be believed, I'm probably not GQ.

I was hanging out with a friend of mine who was describing our friend group to a newcomer.  She said ""our group is made entirely of queer people... and Thomas!"" - it was cute and I felt flattered to be special, but also oddly othered.

A much less cute instance was the time a former partner gave an impassioned speech about how I would never understand them (a transmasculine/agender person) because I was raised a cis male.

So, what's the deal?

Thing is, I certainly don't ""look queer"".  Aside from having a tiny frame, lovely long hair and gratuitous eyelashes, I look like your typical cismale - I have XY chromosomes, a big ol penis, copious body hair and I sport a fancy beard.  I get lots of compliments on my body and it (finally! after years of illness) works well and is healthy.

I don't experience body dysphoria.  On the contrary, I love my body.  My feelings about the body are that it's best to work with what I have and make the best of the constraints nature gave me.

(Which isn't to say I don't sometimes dream about waking up in the body of a woman - if I could wave a wand and painlessly, possibly reversibly, make it so, I would.  But that's not the way it works, so I choose to let go.)

I primarily find myself sexually and romantically attracted to women and nonbinary/trans folks.  So that may or may not mean I'm ""straight"".

I wear dapper-ass men's clothing because I love pockets; so I don't often break gendered ""dress codes"".

And I adore my name.  I have no qualms about the fact that it's a traditional ""boy"" name.  Since after all it is MINE.  (""I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means ME!"")

So there's not a lot of outside, empirical data to suggest that I'm genderqueer.
However, I still don't really identify with the socially constructed image of ""men"".  I'm very much not that.  Nor could I identify fully with ""women"".  So that seems to point me to an affirmative on the ""am I nonbinary"" front.

But at the same time I also have been very reluctant to explore or push the issue.  Because let's be completely honest, society gives genderqueer people a really fucking hard time.  If I can pass as cis and just quietly and inwardly roll my eyes at gender, I'm so much safer than claiming the identity and rocking the boat.

So the question becomes, do any of these things I mentioned bar me from claiming GQ identity?

And a step beyond - if I fit the bill, ought I claim the identity, or keep coasting by in my very useful protective bubble of passing privilege?  Since gender is a total mess, why bother claiming an identity at all, even to say I don't have an identity?

Or am I just a dabbling dilettantish intellectual hopping on a train to win approval?  It's a confusing spot to be in.

Any and all thoughts will be appreciated!
:)

&amp;nbsp;

136,2017-07-25 18:38:51,6pi76n,2,16,"I guess this is kind of a rant / vent - I've been looking around the internet and generally reading up on stuff I see doesn't help too much (there also seems to be very little for AMAB folk who don't want to have surgical/hormone stuff done) - I'm quite impressionable and reading what some people write causes me to go ""is that me? I'm not feeling that rn, but do I feel it now?"" 

I kind of never thought I would make a post like this. I've been questioning my gender for about a couple months now. I am AMAB but I always thought I was just a cis-dude who was kind of feminine, but after having a chat with a friend where they asked me what my experience of femininity was (the first time anyone asked me a question like that) I felt a kind of ""wall"" break down. 

Since then I've kind of been trying to suss out what I am feeling and I've been struggling so much. On the one hand, I feel this intense pull towards the label trans but when I reflect on things for a bit, I don't feel like I want to change my body in any marked way (I like how hairy I am, I love my beard, I love my dick). I also don't feel the desire to present in a more feminine way - as in, I don't feel a draw to wear dresses, or makeup - I like my style quite a bit. I also don't want to surgically change myself (I don't want breasts, a vagina, etc.) 

I also have a tendency to try to fit myself into boxes because I have very severe anxiety which makes it hard for me to cope with ambiguity. Being inbetween or outside the binary has been causing me a lot of anxiety and some mild depression, because I don't feel like there is a spot where I fit. And so I feel this pull to continually find a box to fit into, whether it's trans or cis or what. There have been moments where I get euphoria from identifying as genderqueer, but then they kind of fad away or I get anxious and panicky again. 

I also feel like now that I'm hyper aware of my gender, I have been gendering different parts of my body in the midst of my panic.

I am AMAB but I always thought I was just a cis-dude who was kind of feminine, but after having a chat with a friend where they asked me what my experience of femininity was (the first time anyone asked me a question like that) I felt a kind of ""wall"" break down. \n\nSince then I\'ve kind of been trying to suss out what I am feeling and I\'ve been struggling so much. On the one hand, I feel this intense pull towards the label trans but when I reflect on things for a bit, I don\'t feel like I want to change my body in any marked way (I like how hairy I am, I love my beard, I love my dick). I also don\'t feel the desire to present in a more feminine way - as in, I don\'t feel a draw to wear dresses, or makeup - I like my style quite a bit. I also don\'t want to surgically change myself (I don\'t want breasts, a vagina, etc.) \n\nI also have a tendency to try to fit myself into boxes because I have very severe anxiety which makes it hard for me to cope with ambiguity. Being inbetween or outside the binary has been causing me a lot of anxiety and some mild depression, because I don\'t feel like there is a spot where I fit. And so I feel this pull to continually find a box to fit into, whether it\'s trans or cis or what. There have been moments where I get euphoria from identifying as genderqueer, but then they kind of fad away or I get anxious and panicky again. \n\nI also feel like now that I\'m hyper aware of my gender, I have been gendering different parts of my body in the midst of my panic.

139,2017-07-25 23:29:49,6pk4v0,2,5,"Hey, all. 

I'm not even certain this is real. I've always used female pronouns out of convenience because I was faab, but I've never really identified as female in a real sense. In fact, being female (bodied) has been something that I rarely feel good about, usually ignore, and often outright reject. A few years ago when I was really struggling with being female, I settled on identifying as agender and kind of thought, ""I don't care what anyone thinks, but I don't have to ascribe to any gender role. I can dress and act how I want."" I kept my pronouns, cut my hair off and incorporated a lot of androgyny into my wardrobe. I felt more confident and more comfortable with my presentation. I wrote off my dysphoria as a discomfort with the societal expectations of femininity, and never considered that it might be my body that I was uncomfortable with.

So basically I have never truly identified as any gender. I think a lot of it is that gender roles are very constrictive, and I think they are awful. I thought I didn't care what my body looked like as long as I didn't have to follow any gender roles, but yesterday I ran into some very different emotions. I was watching some transgender videos on youtube my friend had recommended to me and I came across an ftm transformation video. I clicked on it out of curiosity but as I was watching it I started crying. Afterwards, I looked in the mirror and for the first time imagined myself as a man. My heart was racing and I felt like I couldn't breathe. It's all I've been able to think about since. 

I'm definitely going to give this a lot of thought and I'm not asking for a diagnosis or anything, but I just needed someone to vent. My partner is out of the country for two weeks and they're probably the only person I'd feel comfortable reaching out to about this. Thanks for reading.

I can definitely remember wishing I was a boy as a really young kid. However, this feeling subsided significantly as soon as I recognized myself as queer. I now believe that I never truly wanted to be a boy; I was just envious that it was acceptable for a boy to fall in love with a girl, but not for me to.

Other days are difficult. I slip into my baggiest sweats and pull on a hoodie. On these days, I want to cut off my breasts and severely mutilate my genitals. I feel like my body has betrayed me, and I am furious.

152,2017-07-27 09:11:45,6pureu,3,4,"Hi, everyone. After reading a few other people's threads here, I decided to make my own in hopes that I could get some clarity. I understand that labels are, in the end, entirely up to me...it's just that I thought I was cis female until very recently so I'm still new at everything (although I HAVE been trying to educate myself on everything I've been missing) so I guess I would like everyone's ""more expert"" opinion.

First of all, I am a bisexual AFAB. Sexuality was a whole another monster I had to tackle...and I only came to terms with it when I reached my 20s (I come from a very conservative family that still to this very day think LGBTQ people are just ""faking it"" and am still closeted to family, even though my friends know I'm not straight.)

I also suffer from mental illness (anxiety/depression), which has made it difficult for me to accept myself to begin with (and not just in matters of gender/sexuality). Body image issues, poor self esteem, I've had it all...although it has gotten a lot better recently, esp after accepting my sexual identity+gaining a better support system.

So, I don't have much gender dysphoria anymore (although I do sometimes experience it--bottom but not top--esp in intimate situations) but I HAVE wished I wasn't female. I remember being especially uncomfortable during puberty, though, and wanting to be a boy when I was a kid (but even this I'm unsure whether or not it matters since I'm the only  girl in my entire family...so maybe I was just feeling ""left out"" among my many boy cousins?) I identified more with male TV/book characters--but since I'm also bi, I had this strange experience of also being attracted to them. In my dreams, I'm almost always a guy--or at least in the dreams where I'm happy with myself. However, despite all this, since I didn't have that strong body dysmorphia that my clearly FTM or even some nonbinary friends had, I didn't think I was trans.

To make things trickier, although in past years, I was more uncomfortable with it, I've recently grown to embrace my female body (although I suspect this may have to do with the fact that I've grown more accepting towards myself in general.) I love dressing up in feminine clothing and although I wore more gender neutral clothing as a teen, now, I find myself gravitating toward more feminine clothing...mostly because I know I look good in it. (Which I know doesn't matter to a certain extent since there are gay men who love dressing up in drag.) I actually like my not-flat chest, and I know I probably won't transition...at least not until they develop a better male bottom part since most of my dysphoria lies down there anyway. I'm also ok with she/her pronouns and my feminine name. 

So, I don't know. What are your thoughts? I've checked threads by people for each of the labels I've listed above but keep thinking I'm not ""FTM enough,"" ""nonbinary enough,"" ""gender fluid enough,"" or even ""cis enough"" so I'd really appreciate any insight you may have on this matter. Thank you in advance!

I wonder if I can beg for your input. Most of the ""questioning"" subreddits seem dead and the ""gender"" subreddits seem kind of trollish (but I could be interpreting them wrong?)


Anyway, I'm AFAB and have been on T for one year. I had top surgery last month. Up until then, I was sure that I was a transman.


Well, two things have thrown a wrench in my gender identity. The first: I am so so happy with my body now. I love my surgery scar, I've never wanted breasts. I love how I look and am feeling very confident.


Number 2: Apart from a couple hairs on my chin and downstairs growth, I haven't seen many changes on T. So, I asked my doctor about this 2 weeks ago. He casually suggested I double my dose. Well, I've been feeling more feminine recently (trying on makeup and clothes) and don't know if I can attribute it to this. Yesterday I had excruciating cramps and today, Aunt Flo came back.


I'm in such a weird headspace right now. I know it scares my friends to say the word detransition, so am turning to you, Reddit. I hope that you can help me. I'm just not sure anymore.

Dr. Dhejne has [**emphatically denounced**](http://transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) these kinds of misrepresentation of her work. Her study found only that trans people who transition *prior to 1989* had slightly higher rates of suicide attempts than the general public (but still far lower than pre-transition levels), and that trans people post-transition have slightly higher rates of needing mental health services. The study specifically identified abuse and discrimination as the cause of these differences.

Since the interview in which she spelled out why these misrepresentations of her work are wrong is from The TransAdvocate, I've seen people claim the source isn't valid and the interview is fraudulent.

163,2017-07-28 06:18:10,6q1zgi,2,4,"Heyyyy, not sure if this or /r/mtf or /r/asktransgender would be more appropriate but it'd probably be a good idea to post here anyways.

So for some context, I am a 20-yo amab who's had a queer identity of some sort since middle school. In elementary school I never really felt any sexual attraction, but in middle school and high school I realized I was bi and hyper-sexual. I've since been dating a wonderful man for the past 3 years, and I've always liked crossdressing in the bedroom. However, lately I've been feeling more uncomfortable with my body and the baggage that comes with identifying as a man.

I've got too much body hair and jagged nails from habitual nailbiting, and I'm just repulsed every time I look at myself without spending an utterly impractical amount of time in the shower shaving my whole body. I think that, along with really not liking being called 'handsome' or associated with the word 'man', might be some kind of dysphoric feeling.

On the flipside though, I feel absolutely no genital dysphoria. I don't like how I was circumcised but beyond that I have no problems with my penis. I also feel more neutral and somewhat apprehensive about identifying as a woman too, I'm past puberty so it'd be a concerted effort for what'd likely be an awkward transition.

So, my main questions to ask;

1. If I was going to transition, what would be my possible end-game scenarios? I want to look cuter and more girly, but can I be a woman without an inevitable orchiectomy?
2. If I was to go about presenting as non-binary, what options do I have there? I know I'd have to be more vigilant about maintaining my appearance, but I live in California and we'll be getting X gender markers soon.

In elementary school I never really felt any sexual attraction, but in middle school and high school I realized I was bi and hyper-sexual. I've since been dating a wonderful man for the past 3 years, and I've always liked crossdressing in the bedroom. However, lately I've been feeling more uncomfortable with my body and the baggage that comes with identifying as a man.\n\nI've got too much body hair and jagged nails from habitual nailbiting, and I'm just repulsed every time I look at myself without spending an utterly impractical amount of time in the shower shaving my whole body. I think that, along with really not liking being called 'handsome' or associated with the word 'man', might be some kind of dysphoric feeling.\n\nOn the flipside though, I feel absolutely no genital dysphoria. I don't like how I was circumcised but beyond that I have no problems with my penis. I also feel more neutral and somewhat apprehensive about identifying as a woman too, I'm past puberty so it'd be a concerted effort for what'd likely be an awkward transition.\n\nSo, my main questions to ask;\n\n1. If I was going to transition, what would be my possible end-game scenarios? I want to look cuter and more girly, but can I be a woman without an inevitable orchiectomy?\n2. If I was to go about presenting as non-binary, what options do I have there? I know I'd have to be more vigilant about maintaining my appearance, but I live in California and we'll be getting X gender markers soon.\n3. I know this is something I'd eventually have to answer myself, but am I in this for the right reasons?

17,2017-07-14 15:00:05,6n9k4s,1,2,"Hey. Thanks for taking the time to read this. It's probably lame and/or pointless but here's the deal...

I'm 24 years old, AMAB. Even as a kid, I often thought about being a girl. It really appealed to me. I never tried makeup or dressing in feminine clothes, but it's something I never stopped thinking about, even to now. For a while, I thought I might be trans. And I definitely do wish I had been born female. But no, there are definitely times I'm comfortable being a man, and with feeling masculine.

Even so, I'm not at all happy with my body. At times like the one I'm going through now, the dysphoria is unbearable. I catch sight of myself in the mirror, and I recoil in almost tangibly painful disgust. 

I want to be more feminine in general. And I'm not exactly a sterling example of a manly man. I'm a small, soft-spoken nerdy dude. But I was born with a barrel chest and corresponding broad shoulders, with a large, high forehead and terrible, thin hair. I went yesterday to get a haircut that was supposed to be androgynous, and feel like I walked away only looking more masculine. I shave close, often to the point of nicking myself several times, yet the shadow of stubble never seems to go away, even if it feels smooth to the touch.

So... I don't know. What can I do? I have no experience with trying to present as feminine, and so far anything I do just doesn't work. I don't know where to start. I don't even know if it's possible, with how shitty my body is. I'm considering HRT, not to fully transition, but to feminize my body at least. But even that can't fix everything. 

I know this is rambly and likely hard to follow or sympathize with. I'm typing this in the middle of an anxiety attack and I can't even breathe right now.

Hello everyone :) I've been lurking Reddit for the past couple of years, but was never really motivated to make an account for any casual topics. However, the past few years (this one especially) has been quite eye-opening in terms of my identity, and after checking out several LGBT+ subs, I decided to make an account so I could ask for help from people in similar situations. Also, please excuse me if my terminology is incorrect/offensive, I don't really know all the lingo in regards to this sub, but I'm trying my best and will make sure to be as sensitive as possible. 

I identify as a girl for the most part, and I was very girly in the beginning of my life. I loved dresses, had long hair, was friends with all girls, etc. However, I had an older brother whom I'm close to, and as I got older I started to become more tomboyish, made more friends with boys (because of my brother, I found it easier, and I slowly found it harder and harder to relate to /become friends with girls, as they excluded me). I soon stopped wearing skirts, and kept my hair short, (chin-length), much to the chagrin of my mother, who would comments on how my clothing and haircut made me look like a boy. I had/have quite a deep voice for a girl, and this, combined with my increasingly-masculine dress sense and my all-boy friend group, was what kickstarted my getting bullied in middle school. I was called a man, a lesbian, transgender. I denied it, but in retrospect these taunts weren't too far off - I've identified (privately) as bi for the past year/half year now, but haven't told my family. Not out of fear (they are generally very supportive), I just don't know how to broach the subject. However, I've also come to realize that I may be gender fluid. Around 5th grade I started putting my hair in a baseball cap and wearing sunglasses to see if I would make a convincing man. I have pretty strong features, so it surprisingly worked. When I styled myself that way, I would wear a gaint oversized hoodie and baggy shorts, and my family would find it funny cause I looked convincing. However, I slowly found myself really liking myself in that form, and wanting to stay that way for extended periods of time. At first I just brushed it aside as an alter ego. I'm a theatre kid, and  when me made up our own characters to play I was almost always a man, and I was frequently cast in masculine roles. I am quite shy, so theatre was always my catharsis, a way to be more confident. I started to pair this look with a tough, ganster-ish persona, so I thought it was just my way of coping with feelings of emotional weakness. However, once I gave the persona a name, I started to feel like him completely, and would want to be referred to with male pronounce.  However this would only be for about a day, and it would disappear for a long time. The majority of my confusion stems from not really feeling any dysphoria, at least I don't think.  I do frequently feel shame about my body, but I feel like it stems from a different place. I hit puberty very early, and started growing hips and breasts much faster than my classmates, which made me feel extremely insecure, and I've wished a lot of times that it had come later, or even that I could reverse it, because I feel like I lost my childhood/innocence with that (which is pretty silly objectively, but society will tell you what it wants to). I'm also quite curvy compaired to other girls in my school, and a lot of times I've looked in the mirror and wished I didn't have hips, because I feel like it 'ruined' my body from its pre-pubescent purity. Now I'm not really sure why I feel that way.  But other times I've embraced my figure as a sign of womanhood, I have many stereotypically feminine interest, connect with other girls. But other times it feels like the opposite, I feel disconnected from girls, I indulge in my stereotypically masculine hobbies, want to be/be referred to as a boy, and to be a boy. I can't describe it accurately without wasting your time, but all in all it just feels like such a flux, even though its quite infrequent. The majority of the time I really like being a girl (aside from sexism :P ), even love it sometimes, I have recently started to consider myself a feminist, etc. And while these days of feeling like a boy are quite rare, in the moment it feels so strong, and it sometimes just breaks my heart thinking that I'll never be able to 'fully' be a boy, or be accepted as one only some of the time. I don't want to transition (aside from the occasional thought of hating my body), but sometimes I wish I could have a male physique just on the days I want to. All in all, I'm just really confused. I can no longer deny the possibility of me being gender fluid, but sometimes it scares me, because society barely accepts trans people who are binary (if that makes sense, please correct me if I'm wrong), so I don't know if anyone I know would understand how I feel.

I'm Jeremy, I run a Discord server for trans/gender non-conforming individuals. You might be thinking ""Well, there are a lot of trans servers. What makes this one different?"". I think our trans server stands out because we're all very welcoming and eager to add new friends into the fold. We accept anyone regardless of gender identity, progress in transition, or presentation.

We have a lot of channels set up to discuss various topics! Many of us are avid gamers and our server even has it's own Minecraft (Peaceful/Vanilla) server to play on.

On top of the channels to discuss everyday topics or niche interests, we also have support channels. Many of our members are willing to open their ears to you or possibly even assist you with an issue you may have. Of course, we also have rooms for your specific gender identity (transfemme, transmasc, non-binary).

We currently have more younger members than older ones and we'd love some older trans people. &lt;3

If you don't know what Discord is, check out https://discordapp.com/ . Discord is a voice and text chat program a bit like skype typically geared towards gamers but that's definitely not it's only use. People have servers set up from topics varying from trans servers to servers for TV shows.

So I have recently (and a lot in the past) questioned my gender. In the past, I've felt comfortable in my body, but lately I've been very uncomfortable. I hate my boobs, and my feminine features. But I don't hate those things all the time. Sometimes I play up my boobs and wear makeup (like to accentuate my female features). 

More recently, I've been considering about getting breast reduction. Ive considered it in the past, but I'm now researching insurance coverage and how much it will cost, recovery and everything else.

Im currently dating a trans girl, who is very supportive. But I'm afraid of saying ""hey! Im genderfluid"" even though we've talked about this and she has fully said she doesn't care if I am, that she will support me 100% no matter what I choose to do. (Breast reduction, srs) 

Im not sure exactly what I want other than smaller boobs, so they're easier to hide. What kind of exercises can I do to lose weight, and lose boob size?
