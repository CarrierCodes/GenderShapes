No it's not that I'm masculine—I'm **not.** I am *so* far from masculine and I can tell you that right now; I'm 4'11"", 85lb, and I actually really hate the thought of being beefy or hairy or square or you know *traditionally masculine in pretty much any sense.*
It's more a leaning towards, I guess, being a feminine boy. Like those scene boys from 2007, you feel? Take away the ""rawr lol xD"" part and I shamelessly wish I looked just a *bit* more like them.
But of course there's a certain inherent genderqueerness in that that makes me not a ""full"" boy.

Then there's the body dysphoria. Frankly, right now, its the most present kind of dysphoria I have and it won't go away. As for my breasts I'm torn between keeping them and working towards a mastectomy but I'm not sure; I already bind pretty much all the time so it's not like there's much of a point in keeping them, but sometimes I still want to keep them and I'm not sure if it's real or if I just like how they look or something else /shrug emoji
Theeen there's the bottom dysphoria and that is *much* stronger. I want a dick, and its really as plain and simple as that. Out of this whole mess of confusion I've been dealing with for a year, if there's one thing I can wholeheartedly take from it it is that *goddamn I wish I had a dick.* A lot of the time I pack and honestly its a little embarrassing to admit I like to shove a sock down my pants but for me it's pretty helpful. That and pretty much whenever I think about having any kind of sex with anyone, like ya do, I imagine myself with a dick almost all the time.

Don't get me wrong though, I'm not a boy. In terms of my *body* I might have leanings towards something more male, but in every other aspect I'm pretty much entirely androgynous.
What I want to know if I should try going on T. Maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but if I'm going to do it eventually I might as well start working towards it now (especially since my country supposedly might have just taken away my healthcare what up lmao)

2,2017-01-02 01:41:49,5likot,7,4,"Hi all! I am 32 years old and recently have started questioning my gender identity. I'm a little old to be questioning things now but whatever, it's happening. I was born female and always liked more ""boy"" things growing up. I liked more gender neutral clothing and liked to keep my hair short. When I was in middle school I got asked a lot if I was a boy or a girl and I started feeling ashamed. I kind of just accepted I was a girl and tried my best to conform to femininity. I was never very good at it though. I always had my best girl friends dress me up and put makeup on me. I never liked any of that but I did it to fit in. 

As far as my sexuality, I would be into girls when I was growing up but always called it ""girl crushes"". I suppressed my sexuality as well as my gender through my teen years and my 20s. Growing up Mormon would do that to you. I married a man when I was 22 and I'm still married to him now. I told him a few years ago I am bisexual (actually ended pansexual in nature) and we opened our marriage so I could explore that. Currently I'm in relationship with another man as well as a trans guy and I'm in love with all 3 of them. 

My trans boyfriend has opened my eyes to finding my own gender identity. I still identify as female (it's just easier that way at this point) but I don't feel feminine at all nor do I feel masculine at all. I'm somewhere in between. I could care less about what kind of genitalia I have and half the time I love my boobs and half the time I don't. It's weird going through this in my 30s. Shouldn't people know who they are by now? Also my husband is cishet so I'm worried what will happen there if I start presenting more non-binary. Luckily he doesn't expect me to wear makeup and wear dresses and he likes my short hair.

4,2017-01-02 05:42:09,5ljnky,8,16,"My SO has recently come out as non-binary and started using they/them with select friends and co-workers. About a year and a half ago I came out as trans and ID with male pronouns and am now read as male in a lot of my interactions in public. We've been through a lot together and we both see how we are similar and different that we thought (we've been together 12 years and still learning new things every day). People used to see us as a couple or arty-butch lesbians, though we both just kind of saw ourselves as non-gendered and would rather not think about it much.

One problem that we run into a lot these days is that people are adapting to my new pronouns and identity but my SO's NB identity is getting made more invisible in a way because people place them as the ""she"" to my ""he,"" something that makes my SO extremely uncomfortable. For example, we get introduced or referred to in a binary pair, such as ""aunt and uncle,"" or ""mr. and ms."" While I get my gender affirmed, they get mis-gendered and they feel it more directly when its put in binary contrast like that. And besides, its downright silly for anyone to think of us as straight.

It's hard to know how to correct people because familial terms and honorifics are still so gendered. For me, when I get ""ladied"" or ""ma'amed"" I just say, ""I'm a guy"" and that works for me, but that isn't a meaningful option for my SO. So if we get ""ladied"" together, and I only correct the person about my pronouns/gender, I feel like I'm leaving my SO out to dry.

tl;dr I'm looking for advice about ways I can help affirm my SOs non-binary identity when they or we get mis-gendered by friends, family, or in public. They and I talk about this but so far haven't found any good solutions.

I've never been too concerned about fitting into gender norms, personally, as I've never felt like I've fit that great into them anyway. I've pretty much considered myself as a guy, but about a year ago I started crossdressing as a sexual thing, and I started really getting into it. In fact, the thought of going out dressed as a girl sounds like it would be a lot of fun, not just something sexually arousing. Edit: I also started shaving my body hair about a half a year ago.

My second question is this: what would you guys recommend for someone who wants to have a body shape that's a bit more feminine, without putting myself at heavy risk of becoming sterile?

I have a friend who is a transman and he recommended I see his surgeon, Dr. Dulin. I went with him to the free consultation. I liked Dulin but man he did not want to do ANYTHING but DI.

I want to consult another surgeon. I feel like it was a good learning experience though. Seems to me if a surgeon specializes in a certain technique, they seem to only want to use that technique, regardless of whether it's really appropriate for the patient or not.
My question is any nonbinary folks who've had top surgery? Who did you go to? Did you retain nipple sensation? Did you like the experience? Did they understand how nonbinary top surgery could differ from top surgery for a transman?

Anyway, I left feeling a bit disappointed...\nI want to consult another surgeon. I feel like it was a good learning experience though. Seems to me if a surgeon specializes in a certain technique, they seem to only want to use that technique, regardless of whether it's really appropriate for the patient or not.\nMy question is any nonbinary folks who've had top surgery? Who did you go to? Did you retain nipple sensation? Did you like the experience? Did they understand how nonbinary top surgery could differ from top surgery for a transman?\n\nThanks"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Agender shopping for top surgery. advice?', 'created': 1484487761.0}"

So, I'm in my late twenties and up until recently I've always considered myself a cismale. I'm a very performatively 'bro-y' guy sometimes and have a lot invested in the masculine friendships in my life.

Are there any other non-binary people out there who experienced these same feelings?  Has anyone regretted going on hormones?

Pros:

- My Body: I work out a lot, but don't really see the results that I want.  Testosterone would give me the energy to go harder at the gym, and give me the muscles I want.  
- My trans identity will be validated.  As shitty as it sounds, I'll be ""really trans"" rather than being perceived as someone who is just trying on an identity.
- I wonder if I'll become more attractive,  Maybe some of the things I'm insecure about will get better with testosterone.
- I wonder if my anxiety will go down being read as male.  I wonder if I'll be able to speak in front of crowds with more ease.

Cons:

- I wonder if I'll become uglier.  I wonder if my jawline is too weak for when i become more masculine.

So, background: I'm a 20 year old nonbinary, transmasculine person, about a year and a half on testosterone.

Anyways, I attended new years's eve party with some very close female friends of mine, and there were also 3 guys there that I had never met before, who didn't and still don't know I'm trans.  These men, all in their mid-ish twenties, were very...""dude-bro"" for lack of a better term.  I really do hate to be so generalizing, but these guys were the type of people who, to me, just seemed to *reek* of toxic masculinity, or at least hyper masculinity.  They were standing/sitting around drinking beer and smoking cigs, and I thought to myself repeatedly throughout the night, ""these are the kinds of guys that would possibly ask me inappropriate questions if they found out I was trans, or joke behind my back about me not having a dick...  These guys remind me of the boys in my high school who tossed around the word ""f&amp;ggot.""  *These are the kinds of guys I am scared of.*""

Fast forward a few weeks...one of my female friends at the party, the one who I'm closest to, has been ignoring my text messages, so I confronted her about it.  She basically said that *she* felt uncomfortable with *me* being uncomfortable around ""other men.""  She said that she's friends with guys who are way more masculine than those people at the party, and that me being uncomfortable made her feel bad for having friends like that...

She basically wrote off my discomfort around these guys as me being uncomfortable with myself, as if she thought that I didn't feel ""manly enough"" in comparison.  But that's not at all what was going on.  

I feel like I should end this post here because I'm ranting...if I can clear anything up about the situation, please let me know.  I would really appreciate some feedback, so let me know if you feel similarly or know what I mean.  This has been bothering me a lot recently.  Thanks for reading.

""Hello! This might seem silly which is why I'm on a throwaway.

To be more specific, I try to present androgynously and if I were to identify as anything other than cis it'd be agender, or just NB. But I just can't get over the hurdle of feeling fake for feeling this way. Another way I could put it is that I'm worried I'm copying the people around me, I guess?

I only started questioning it a while after, which is another big reason I\'m worried my feelings aren\'t valid.\n\nI hope this makes sense. Basically, I\'m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or if I\'m just a total fraud. I\'m sorry if this is just totally stupid/doesn\'t belong here.""\n\nTo be more specific, I try to present androgynously and if I were to identify as anything other than cis it\'d be agender, or just NB. But I just can\'t get over the hurdle of feeling fake for feeling this way. Another way I could put it is that I\'m worried I\'m copying the people around me, I guess?\n\nI\'d love to hear other people\'s insight on this.

At the third, I didn't speak to him, but stayed where I wanted and conversed with other family whether he was there or not.  It wasn't to snub him, but I have 0 will to even be polite to him.

I said, ""No, don't, I'm serious"" and he kept trying to hug me.  I raised my voice (out of panic basically) and said ""Don't touch me!"" and he left, embarrassed.

What motivated us to make another trans server amongst the many existing ones is that we have seen unjust treatment in some other trans servers and we hope to make a space that will be unbiased and competent. Anyone will be welcome here regardless of age, gender identity and progress of transition. We have about 24 members of all identities. 

We have many channels (such as Gaming, Music, Anime, and Beauty) as well as seperate channels for Non-Binary, MtF, and FtM to talk in. We also have a detailed role system that is outlined in the rules and info channel when you join the server. 

This server has channels for serious topics but overall we want to promote a relaxed and friendly environment.

2,2017-01-02 01:03:38,5lidrx,18,22,"TL;DR: Trying to figure out where I fall on the gender spectrum and never quite landing anywhere for very long has me feeling anxious and confused at times. Sometimes I do feel totally aligned with my birth sex for one reason or another, so I'm wondering if I should even bother identifying as non-binary, and just think of myself as a super gender non-conforming woman and stop thinking about gender stuff so much. 

Tiniest bit of background - I'm a fairly masculine presenting AFAB person, but had lots of years of expressing much more feminine, identifying as a woman and feeling totally comfortable in that way. I have days where I feel totally solid/empowered as a non-binary person, and other days where I'm actually like ""I'm totally a woman, yeah!"" The back and forth is wildly confusing for me. I also find that when I feel really ""womanly"" (it's kind of this feeling in my body of feeling really aligned with that, and really enjoying my body as a 'woman's body') that I get super thrown off by my masculine appearance. Like, I was shopping for clothes today, and caught my reflection in the mirror and had this thought of ""Where did the old me go?"" It's almost like I miss my old self, even though whenever I've literally forced myself to wear my former ""girl"" clothes - dresses, boots, more feminine cut tops - I feel like I'm completely in drag, almost to point of weird dysphoria in a way. I just suddenly sometimes become overwhelmed with how masculine presenting I've become and how much of a shift I've undergone the past year, even though the look completely suits me and I feel really happy and comfortable and attractive. Sometimes I wonder whether I feel more comfortable identifying as non-binary because I cant seem to reconcile my masculine appearance with any solid sense of womanhood. That is absolutely not to say a woman cannot be masculine! It's more like, I literally had 2 decades of defining my womanhood through femininity and trying not to be too masculine because I didn't want to appear ""butch"" (internalized homophobia from being gay), that now I find it extremely difficult to see myself as a woman on a regular basis. Like, the moments I feel like a woman are great, but they don't last, and I feel confused. I just wish I had a more stable sense of gender, but I suppose that's maybe not in the cards for me? Non-binary overall does seem far more of expansive of a term to hold what seems like a lot of gender fluidity, but sometimes I wonder - am I actually ok being a woman, but just feel uncomfortable / unable to identify as one because I don't look and present how I used to?

10,2017-01-03 04:36:05,5lpy32,6,32,"Hi all! Glad to see this sub exists, and I'm enjoying reading your posts so far! 

I'm continuing the process now of expressing my gender identity, after a few years of just living as cis because I felt afraid to be myself. 

I've felt somewhat masculine since I was about 8 years old. But it wasn't until I was 25 that I realized that I wanted to express these feelings. It was then that I started cross-dressing, and OMG did it feel SO amazing! :)

But then I graduated college and got a job doing fundraising for a nonprofit. Yeah, I spend a lot of time schmoozing old wealthy people. So I felt a lot of pressure to present as cis/feminine, especially since I'm asking them for money! 
At the same time I got into a relationship with a woman who was clearly much more attracted to my cis/feminine presentation, and yeah. That sucked. 

I still have that job, but recently ended the relationship (for unrelated reasons) and now with this new freedom I am renewing a commitment to express myself the way I want to, and not partially closet myself anymore. 

I suppose I'm genderqueer/fluid. Maybe...80% of the time I prefer to wear ""men's"" clothes and present masculine. 10% of the time I am the complete opposite - hyper-feminine and I just want to wear short skirts and heels and lipstick - which honestly feels more ""queer"" to me, if that makes sense since it's such a deviation from my usual masculine feelings. The remaining 10% I'm just like, ""I don't feel any gender at all today so I guess a T-shirt and jeans?"" :P

So anyway. A question for y'all- How has your experience been at work? How do you typically present at work, and do you have any advice for me? More broadly, how do you fight that urge to go back in the ""cis closet"" when it's convenient? :/ 
[My organization *does* have a gender identity protection clause, so that's awesome. My main concern is that I regularly have to have contact with old conservative/heteronormative people. ]

Rant:

One of my friends got engaged roughly a year ago and has their wedding planned for this upcoming summer. A couple months after their engagement (about ten months ago), they asked me to be a bridesmaid.

They have known I'm agender since I first came out. They know I bind. This person, themself, has identified as a man and as genderfluid at various times in the past few years, while being AFAB. I'm not sure what their current gender alignment is, but I do know their fiance is somewhat pressuring them to be more feminine since they got together, and my friend has expressed some annoyance at this. All that to say, they should understand my gender and where I'm coming from.

Despite this, they've asked me to wear a dress and makeup. Back when they first asked me to be a bridesmaid, they offered me a choice between a dress and a tuxedo. I hesitantly (and with some pressure), said I would wear a dress. A few months ago, roughly six months after I agreed to the dress, I realized I have started to feel more masculine and would be deeply uncomfortable in a dress and makeup. I expressed as much to my friend, and they pretty much told me that since I agreed to the dress, I have to do that, despite not having done any dress shopping yet. They want the bridesmaids to all look alike, which means no tux for me.

I know I should probably try to reiterate to them that this dress will make me very uncomfortable and cause me dysphoria, but I'm not sure they care enough to change their mind. I had a conversation with them earlier today where I jokingly asked if I would have to shave my legs and/or wear a ""real"" bra for the wedding and they pretty much told me that it's their wedding and if I don't want to do it their way, I don't have to be in it. I'm scared to say anything more because I don't want them snapping at me.

I vaguely understand that it's supposed to be ""their day"" and I should be willing to work with what they want, but am I really supposed to have to put up with what will probably be a lot of dysphoria to appease them? I know I could just drop out of the wedding party but I really do want to be there to support them, especially because we've always had a bit of a rough friendship and I want to show them that I care.

This is all compounded by the fact that I have a mental illness that can impede my rationality and cause me to get very mad at people for very little reason, and can cause me to twist situations in my head and see them differently than how they really are. Therefore, I literally cannot tell if my upset at this friend is called for or not, or if they would really be that mad if I insist on wearing a tux. I'm at a loss for what to do and I really don't want to lose this friend.

It's especially a concern because we're going to get fitted for dresses tomorrow. I don't know if I should try bringing up the tux again. I also don't know if I'm going to end up exploding in anger at the friend and mess everything up between us. I really do not want to buy a dress I can't afford that I will not only never wear again, but also will actively be dysphoric in.

Thanks for reading if you made it through that. If you have any words of advice, they would be greatly welcomed.

I'm 20 AFAB and experience some gender dysphoria. I am sure I fall under the trans umbrella somehow. 

For about a year I was very convinced that I was a binary trans guy. However, I'm feeling lately that is not the case. I know this is very common, but I'm wondering if any people specifically have experience with their gender identity shifting with their sexuality?

I am bi (or pan or queer or whatever you want to call it) and I am dating a lovely lady, have been for the past year. When I'm with her, I feel best expressing my more masculine side. However, when I picture myself with a guy (if that happens again in the future), I see myself more as an androgynous feminine-leaning person. Really, when I'm with my gf I feel best when I picture myself getting top surgery, starting T, and being masculine. But when I fantasize about sleeping with or dating men, I feel okay with them being attracted to my breasts and I have the urge to be more feminine. I don't see myself being with a guy as a guy.

I feel like this might be some internalized homophobia, but I'm not sure which way the homophobia is going. Am I afraid of being in a gay male relationship or a gay female one? Or maybe that's not it. I don't know.

I've never been too concerned about fitting into gender norms, personally, as I've never felt like I've fit that great into them anyway. I've pretty much considered myself as a guy, but about a year ago I started crossdressing as a sexual thing, and I started really getting into it. In fact, the thought of going out dressed as a girl sounds like it would be a lot of fun, not just something sexually arousing.
Edit: I also started shaving my body hair about a half a year ago. Again, it started out as something sexual, but it just feels... right. So I do it on the regular.(edited)
At the same time though, I normally wear boys clothes, and those feel right on me too. In fact, I really love wearing suits. I find that my body looks good in both suits and skirts and blouses, which is something I love~
Basically, I think I might be androgynous, or bigender, or something, but I'm not really sure. Maybe I'm just a girly cis guy? I dunno.
My second question is this: what would you guys recommend for someone who wants to have a body shape that's a bit more feminine, without putting myself at heavy risk of becoming sterile? Is that something I'd just have to live with if I started taking estrogen? Is it possible to take it in small doses and not risk any of the issues with my testicles? Or, at the very least, to keep those down to a minimum? Also, would the supplement pueraria mirifica be something of a good in-between for me?
If anyone wants to see pics as a reference, or to evaluate me in terms of masculinity/femininity (because i'm not good at explaining :P) please let me know. I'm 5'5"", 180 lbs, and about 44"" on my hips. I look ridiculous with facial hair.

19,2017-01-04 16:00:39,5lzw05,10,14,"Hey all, this is my first post on this subreddit and I'm a little nervous about it. This is mainly about being nonbinary at work, but also bleeds over into other aspects of my life. I'm AFAB and came out as nonbinary in the spring of 2016. I feel very male as a baseline, but strangely have no desire to transition at this point, I'm pretty attracted to the idea of being male in an androgynous/AFAB body. I have anxiety, a smattering of depression, and PTSD, and a serious partner (AMAB, cis) of 3 years who knows and accepts me. I'm a survivor of childhood sexual assault, and one of the lasting effects I feel from that is an extreme disconnect between my mental self and my physical self. Because of this, my physical dysphoria is pretty limited to my breasts, which have always been on the larger end. I do a lot of kickboxing and MMA, so the rest of my body is muscular and androgynous the way I'd like it to be. I'd like breast reduction/top surgery later in my life when I can afford it.

I graduated college in May and started a job at a pharmaceutical company close to my mom's house, so I moved back home to save up some money for grad school. My mom knows I'm genderqueer, and is accepting, but has not made much of an effort to try to use they/them pronouns with me, despite my asking politely. Additionally, only 2 people at my job know that I'm genderqueer, and neither of them use my pronouns either. I work in a pretty science-oriented field, and there isn't a whole lot of coming together and socialization (I'm also the youngest at my current job by about 8 years) so aside from sending out an office-wide memo, I don't really have a way of disseminating this information to a wider audience. I'm fairly confident that my coworkers would accept my identity, there's just no organic way to tell them about it.

The other hurdle in this is my presentation. I'm in the process of growing out my hair (which I've noticed is the opposite move most AFAB NB folks take) because I've always felt a connection to long-haired masculine expression, so I'm going more for the Qui Gon Jinn look than the flowing long haired bombshell look. Other than that, I present pretty androgynously, but the fact that I don't bind combined with my long hair throws a lot of people off, giving them the idea that I'm not ""serious"" about either my gender presentation or identity. Part of me wants to chop off my hair and go the super masculine presentation route but I've put a lot of work into growing my hair out and don't want to make a change for the sake of *hopefully* getting the message across.

All my friends from college use my pronouns, in addition to my partner and his med school friends, but I don't live with or near either of these groups so I go through my daily life being misgendered in a community where you see more porsches than queer folks, and that's pretty crushing.

This is mainly about being nonbinary at work, but also bleeds over into other aspects of my life. I\'m AFAB and came out as nonbinary in the spring of 2016. I feel very male as a baseline, but strangely have no desire to transition at this point, I\'m pretty attracted to the idea of being male in an androgynous/AFAB body. I have anxiety, a smattering of depression, and PTSD, and a serious partner (AMAB, cis) of 3 years who knows and accepts me. I\'m a survivor of childhood sexual assault, and one of the lasting effects I feel from that is an extreme disconnect between my mental self and my physical self. Because of this, my physical dysphoria is pretty limited to my breasts, which have always been on the larger end. I do a lot of kickboxing and MMA, so the rest of my body is muscular and androgynous the way I\'d like it to be.

28,2017-01-05 21:10:47,5m93ny,12,22,"One of my biggest tensions with gender has been the prevalence of all-or-nothing thinking.

It comes up in more transparent ways, with the gender binary, the idea that you're either a woman or a man, and that's the end of the story.  I see this both in transphobic settings (i.e. the assertion that AFAB people are ""just women"" and AMAB people are ""just men"" and ""that's just the way it is."") as well as in some more liberal circles, like when people assert ""Trans women are women"" and ""Trans men are men.""  Like, I want to respect trans people's identities unconditionally, but I sometimes feel uncomfortable with this narrative in how it gets forced on people.  I have seen trans people get ""corrected"" if/when they say things like ""Back when I was a man"" or ""Back when I was a woman"" and then people say ""But you've always been a woman / man"".  I get super uncomfortable in a space where people ""correct"" other trans people's narratives like this...it feels like they're forcing them into a box, telling them how to think in a coercive way.

It's like, there are all these different definitions of ""woman"" and ""man"" floating around out there.  And one of the main reasons I identify as nonbinary is that they don't line up for me.  By some definitions, I'm a man because I'm AMAB and because of my biology.  But by other definitions I've never fit the idea of maleness, because of how I think and operate.  Then there's how I'm gendered by others, which depends on the setting and the person.

I feel most comfortable when people see and acknowledge all the nuances of gender...when they're not trying to force people into boxes and categories.  One reason I like the term ""nonbinary"" is specifically because it rejects the categories...it says: ""No, I don't fit into the woman box, nor do I fit into the man box.  I'm outside the boxes."" and it doesn't make any more statements beyond these.  I have become increasingly less comfortable though, saying ""I am nonbinary"", instead preferring to say ""I identify as nonbinary.""  I don't want to say I ""am"" anything because that seems to gloss over all the nuances, all the ways in which my experiences of gender are complex and sometimes disjoint.

I find though that all-or-nothing thinking has infiltrated many of the supposedly trans-friendly spaces that I'm a part of.  I don't like the cis vs. trans distinction, and I find people often talk about it in ways I feel really uncomfortable with.  I feel like my own experience blurs the boundaries between cis and trans experience and identity.  It's like, technically, I'm trans, because my identity doesn't match my assigned birth sex.  But I also don't experience strong dysphoria, and I don't want to pursue HRT or surgery.  I don't want to get into the realm of comparing people as being ""more trans"" or ""less trans"" but I do feel like there are ways in which my experience fits some cis people's more closely than some trans people's.  Also, there are a lot of settings where I can ""pass"" as cis, and I had many years living thinking I was cis, because I had no concept of nonbinaryness.  So there's a large degree to which I identify both with cis *and* trans people.  And I get really uncomfortable when people bash, or make negative generalizations about cis people.  I get uncomfortable even when people label or identify other people as cis, like assuming people are cis, because people assumed that about me for years when I am not really fully cis.  I also just...I dunno...the whole idea of having to pick cis or trans bothers me, just like having to pick female or male on some form bothers me.

My closest friends get this stuff, and support me, but I often feel really uncomfortable in left-wing spaces because they often get sucked into all-or-nothing thinking based on group identity.  This seems to have gotten worse after the 2016 election, which I understand somewhat, because I think people have a tendency to get angry and worked up in response to hate speech, and there was a ton of hate speech floating around (including a lot directed at me).  But like...I still don't like it.  I don't feel safe around all-or-nothing thinking.

I feel frustrated, like, often far-left spaces are the only spaces that are explicitly embracing of my nonbinary identity...but they often end up buying into aspects of identity politics and left-wing ideology that I can get very uncomfortable with.

31,2017-01-07 21:05:07,5mms6s,14,33,"Hello!  I am AMAB and after years of living as male and mostly wearing men's clothing, over the past few years have explored mixing up my gender presentation to where I now have a pretty switchy wardrobe.  The experience has been eye-opening.

One of the things that surprised me was how many ""invisible"" aspects of gender there were, where like, when I started wearing clothing from tho women's section, even casual clothing that is not immediately consciously identifiable to others as ""women's clothing"", it changed certain ways that people interacted with me.  Some things I noticed were:

* Men's clothing makes me seem like I take up more space, it makes me look bulkier, and women's clothing is more likely to be form-fitting, thus making me look smaller.  I have noticed that when wearing women's clothing, even stuff that doesn't overtly look like ""women's clothing"", people are less likely to step out of the way for me on the sidewalk, perhaps because I take up less space in people's visual field.
* Women's clothing is often finer-textured and softer to the touch.  A lot of it feels nicer against my skin and I find that comforting, but I've also noticed that some of the soft textures on external surfaces of clothing induce people to touch me more or make people respond more positively when I hug them or are close to them, sort of like ""Oh wow your sweater is so soft!!!"" as someone starts stroking my arm.
* A lot of women's shoes are thinner-soled and more minimally structured, whereas men's are bulkier and have thicker soles and more padding and support. Wearing women's shoes, besides making me seem a bit shorter, makes me more mindful of my environment and changes my gait, tending to make me take smaller, more careful steps and reducing the power of my gait, but I think in some ways it has been good for my balance and agility, easier on my feet and joints.

* Women's clothing is more diverse and tends to be more attention-getting visually.  It thus seems to lead to people commenting (positively or negatively) on the colors, patterns, or textures of what I'm wearing.  Like, I get a lot more comments of people liking my color scheme or noticing that I matched colors when wearing women's clothing than when wearing men's clothing, even if I was equally conscious or mindful about trying to match or color-coordinate when wearing the men's clothing.
* Women's clothing tends to draw more attention to my body, both showing off more skin and also being more form-fitting and showing off my shape more, leading me to get more comments on my body when I wear it, whereas men's clothing tends to hide and conceal my body, thus reducing the amount of comments I get on it.  People definitely ""check me out"" more when wearing women's clothing, and I get more comments on my legs, butt, etc.

Becoming aware of these things has been really empowering because when I see the form-function relationships with these things, I can then sometimes pick clothing in ways that changes people's behavior in ways that I want or feel more comfortable with.  It also has made me more directly aware of sexism, including both ways in which women are objectified more or discriminated against, and ways in which men can be discriminated against (like how men are perceived as more imposing or threatening, independently of their behavior, which for example relates to the shape / structure of their clothing making them look more bulky).

I suspect there are a ton more things though that I'm not consciously aware of yet.

Some things I noticed were:\n\n* Men\'s clothing makes me seem like I take up more space, it makes me look bulkier, and women\'s clothing is more likely to be form-fitting, thus making me look smaller.  I have noticed that when wearing women\'s clothing, even stuff that doesn\'t overtly look like ""women\'s clothing"", people are less likely to step out of the way for me on the sidewalk, perhaps because I take up less space in people\'s visual field.\n* Women\'s clothing is often finer-textured and softer to the touch.  A lot of it feels nicer against my skin and I find that comforting, but I\'ve also noticed that some of the soft textures on external surfaces of clothing induce people to touch me more or make people respond more positively when I hug them or are close to them, sort of like ""Oh wow your sweater is so soft!!!"" as someone starts stroking my arm.\n* A lot of women\'s shoes are thinner-soled and more minimally structured, whereas men\'s are bulkier and have thicker soles and more padding and support.

52,2017-01-12 19:51:24,5nlk52,7,5,"Does anyone here have any firsthand experience on the effects of binding on the appearance of smaller chests? I know binders soften the tissue and tend to make one's chest sag after a while, but I'm wondering how frequent/long term the binder usage has to be for that, and whether there are differences with one's natural chest size.

I'm mostly asking because I bought a binder but I'm not top dysphoric per se - I mind my chest because it guarantees that I'll be read as female, but on more feminine days or when I'm by myself, I don't particularly hate it.

I am in my mid twenties and feeling more and more confused / frustrated with some feelings that have been growing inside me since I was a pre teen.  

Born male but never felt like I fit into my gender properly. I assumed everyone felt a little of what I did and just ignored it.  

First time I cross dressed was about a decade ago and then I didn't again until maybe 4 years ago when I worked somewhere which allowed me access to un-worn women's clothing. I stole a lot of things there and felt extremely ashamed. I still do, I don't condone theft but I felt trapped and I was too afraid to go buy things in person for fear of being caught / outed.  

I have since thrown out all the clothing out of fear my roommate might see it when we moved in together and I just feel like a part of me is missing now.  

I'm becoming more and more upset with my appearance, I keep flip-flopping between having daily dreams of a fairly feminine figure to telling myself I need to accept it will never happen. I think I could become fairly slim but my body hair just seems like an impossible task to overcome.  

I am emotionally attached to women and have dated them exclusively but have had a few major relationships collapse over the last few years as I realize more and more that I do not want to fall into any fixed gender role, I don't want to marry, I don't want to have a girl fall in love with me only to have me break it off because I've been thinking about men.  

The other thing which is making everything even more confusing is that I HAVE experimented and slept with a couple of men and none of the experiences felt... right to me. I don't know if it's just my mind telling me that it's wrong because that's what most society believes or if it's how I really feel.

So I identify as female gender non confirming, I don't really feel like I'm male or female, however the body I'm working with has larger boobs (apparently size uk f/g) and an hourglass figure. I'm neither thin nor fat and kinda tall (5'8''). More of a men's medium, women's large for tops at least. I'm probably a 10-12 (us) women's bottoms.

Men's clothing styles appeal to me, and like many I have the issue of fit at the chest and hips. I'm not trying to emphasize curves, nor am I trying to bind them. I tend to minimize the appearance the curvy parts with jackets/baggy hoodies and crew collar t-shirts because I don't like to attract attention. If people glance but don't really look at me I get called ""sir"", but then if they actually look at me they realize I'm a woman. I'm pretty comfortable with that, I get left alone for the most part. I am very particular about clothing feeling comfortable, neither tight nor baggy, just a bit on the loose fitting side. If I look neat enough people don't give me a second glance.

I'm looking for clothes that would make me look neatly dressed and basic. Basically something more on the timeless side that will last years, but not too conservative. On the nicer side of casual where I wouldn't look out of place in an urban environment like NYC where people do dress a bit more formally than elsewhere. 

I like wearing mellow earth tones, army green, cadet blue, dark maroon, brown, and all shades of grey. Most people here wear black, but that's not my thing. I am going for a capsule style wardrobe, ie I get up and whatever I put on matches even if I'm half awake dressing in the dark. I don't want to think about it much but look neatly dressed.

I love men's clothing because it allows freedom of movement, hiking clothing that is articulated at the joints with gusseted crotch is the most appealing, however hiking clothes tend to be baggy and ill fitting, and climbing clothing seems to be too tight. I love having lots of pockets. Cargo pants are best. I'm over 35 so a lot of the styles that appeal to younger people won't apply to me. I'm not sure if anyone shares this demographic, I'm taller and older so my style preferences and needs may be a bit different than most. I know there are a small contingent of gen xers on reddit, though not sure how many of them are nonbinary. Haven't really seen anything online that meets my preferences or style.

I was with a group of friends the other day and one of them was talking over me (someone who is visibly female). I said he (who goes by ‘he’) was mansplaining, and he told me to say “genderfluidsplaining” and to “please not misgender him.” This was in front of many people and ignored that he had just been very rude to me.

This makes me very uncomfortable. He said that he doesn’t have male privilege or socialization because as a genderfluid person, he “interpreted his socialization differently” than other men do. But he’s a white, visibly male appearing person, in a very comfortable STEM position, in a group of mostly male friends. He has a very male name. He regularly dominates conversation and habitually explains to me things I already know. He talks to me like men talk to women, and the word “mansplaining” was coined to identify and call out that behavior.

I have no idea how to handle interacting with him anymore. The context in which he told me he was “genderfluid” and not to misgender him came across as aggressive and controlling because he raised it at a point of deflecting a sexist thing he did to me, and wouldn’t let go of the conversation and kept saying “will you please not misgender me”. He apologized in one breath for interrupting me before going back to chastising me, and went on to say that if I “kept misgendering him” he wouldn’t be my friend anymore. All of this happened less than five minutes after I got to the bar.

He also said I can’t possibly understand because of “cis” privilege, assuming that I have any innate attachment to my femaleness and couldn’t, you know, be agender or genderqueer or anything else, myself. I am visibly female in my body, but I regularly get ‘sirred’ because I have short hair and wear a lot of t-shirts and jeans (he has never been visibly non-conforming or androgynous in the time I've known him). I asked him if he thought he was the only genderfluid person at the table and he said it was okay to assume since so few people in the population are.

I’m hurt and very uncomfortable by all this. I want to be understanding and I get not feeling like a man, but I feel disempowered by not being able to call out his behavior which I see as very sexist and the result of growing up with male privilege and entitlement.

This is exactly what I wanted for most of this time. I've had interests in crossdressing and makeup for years now. Every once in awhile, those urges would creep up and feel overwhelming. I posted a rant on /r/crossdressing a year ago on one such occasion, but overall it was rarely a problem. 

About two or three months ago, those feelings became stronger and stronger. I started to think about my gender identity during work and school on a regular basis. Clearly this wasn't something I could afford to ignore anymore, so I started to buy makeup and clothes online and shave my legs. This does a lot to balance out my ever conflicting gender identity. 

The problem is I don't want to be completely feminine, which is why I'm posting here instead of strictly transgender subreddit. Some days I wake up satisfied with my physique. I've developed very broad shoulders and a wide chest which both look great in male clothing. But some days I hate the way look. Some days I wish I was slim and curvy like a girl. The workouts and diets required to get either of these physiques is completely different, and I clearly can't have both. I love the strength I've gained from weight lifting and I would hate to lose it, but some times all I care about is just having a butt that looks great in leggings. 

I feel so weird and so split apart by wanting two identities for myself that conflict with each other so greatly.

So, [El Goonish Shive](http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2002-01-21) (named after its creator, Dan Shive) is a webcomic that's been going on for about 15 years now. It follows the stories of:  
- [Susan](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Susan), a feminist wielding a magical hammer  
- [Grace](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Grace), a magical part-alien squirrel-girl  
- [Justin](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Justin), a gay guy with kick-ass martial arts skills  
- [Elliot](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Elliot), a guy who's got a spell that lets him shapeshift into the opposite sex (and also a superhero)  
- [Ellen](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Ellen), Elliot's bi twin ""sister"" who was created due to Elliot touching a magical diamond while he was in ""girl form"" which separated the spell from his body (it makes sense I promise)
- [Nanase](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Nanase), Elliot's ex and Ellen's current girlfriend, a super powerful bisexual magic-user with Japanese heritage  
- [Sarah](http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp.php?id=397), Elliot's ex who's somewhat confused sexually  
- [Ashley](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=2044), a bi and-or pan (it's not been made clear, really) girl who's kickass at soccer.  
- [Rhoda and Catalina](http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp.php?id=509), a cute as fuck lesbian couple  
- And finally (this is who the post is about), [Tedd](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Tedd), an androgynous genderfluid person with purple hair and a love for magic. 

Tedd is an absolutely amazing character and a fantastic source of GF representation. While they're rather sexist and stereotypically male in regards to women for the first few years of the comic, they matures *amazingly* throughout, learning and accepting more about all kinds of people. This is in large part due to their  escapades with people like Ellen (a literal incarnation of their best friend as the opposite sex) and Susan (a girl who more or less beats into Tedd some feminist values).  
Very recently in the comic, Tedd has learned that, despite what they used to think, they actually *can* use magic, and their spell is the ability to switch between sexes more or less at will. They also learned that they're genderfluid (something all of their friends knew and thought Tedd already knew). This has been pretty clear throughout, as Tedd has been very clearly (I mean, they've *said* it before) more comfortable as a boy at certain times, and as a girl at others.  
Tedd's realization has actually become a source of stress for him; having never thought about this kind of thing before, Tedd is pretty overwhelmed and confused at this point in the comic (not just from the gender thing; they also realized that they were on track to destroy magic's existence, but that's another story entirely), and their experiences honestly seems very very accurate to real life. They never really knew that they were genderfluid, they just kinda changed when they were comfortable and rolled with that. Tedd oftentimes put themselves into situations in which they could be a girl, like [claiming it made them better at cooking](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=666) and [throwing a gender-bending birthday party for Grace](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=664). Now, Tedd [has struggled with dysphoria before](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=796) in the comics, but they didn't know that's what it was; they thought it was due to the fact that, at the time, Grace was a dude.

Anyways, [at this point in the comics](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=2304) Tedd is going through the realization that he is, in fact, genderfluid.

It follows the stories of:  \n- [Susan](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Susan), a feminist wielding a magical hammer  \n- [Grace](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Grace), a magical part-alien squirrel-girl  \n- [Justin](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Justin), a gay guy with kick-ass martial arts skills  \n- [Elliot](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Elliot), a guy who\'s got a spell that lets him shapeshift into the opposite sex (and also a superhero)  \n- [Ellen](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Ellen), Elliot\'s bi twin ""sister"" who was created due to Elliot touching a magical diamond while he was in ""girl form"" which separated the spell from his body (it makes sense I promise)\n- [Nanase](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Nanase), Elliot\'s ex and Ellen\'s current girlfriend, a super powerful bisexual magic-user with Japanese heritage  \n- [Sarah](http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp.php?id=397), Elliot\'s ex who\'s somewhat confused sexually  \n- [Ashley](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=2044), a bi and-or pan (it\'s not been made clear, really) girl who\'s kickass at soccer.  \n- [Rhoda and Catalina](http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp.php?id=509), a cute as fuck lesbian couple  \n- And finally (this is who the post is about), [Tedd](http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/Tedd), an androgynous genderfluid person with purple hair and a love for magic. \n\nTedd is an absolutely amazing character and a fantastic source of GF representation. While they\'re rather sexist and stereotypically male in regards to women for the first few years of the comic, they matures *amazingly* throughout, learning and accepting more about all kinds of people. This is in large part due to their  escapades with people like Ellen (a literal incarnation of their best friend as the opposite sex) and Susan (a girl who more or less beats into Tedd some feminist values).  \nVery recently in the comic, Tedd has learned that, despite what they used to think, they actually *can* use magic, and their spell is the ability to switch between sexes more or less at will. They also learned that they\'re genderfluid (something all of their friends knew and thought Tedd already knew). This has been pretty clear throughout, as Tedd has been very clearly (I mean, they\'ve *said* it before) more comfortable as a boy at certain times, and as a girl at others.  \nTedd\'s realization has actually become a source of stress for him; having never thought about this kind of thing before, Tedd is pretty overwhelmed and confused at this point in the comic (not just from the gender thing; they also realized that they were on track to destroy magic\'s existence, but that\'s another story entirely), and their experiences honestly seems very very accurate to real life. They never really knew that they were genderfluid, they just kinda changed when they were comfortable and rolled with that. Tedd oftentimes put themselves into situations in which they could be a girl, like [claiming it made them better at cooking](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=666) and [throwing a gender-bending birthday party for Grace](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=664). Now, Tedd [has struggled with dysphoria before](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=796) in the comics, but they didn\'t know that\'s what it was; they thought it was due to the fact that, at the time, Grace was a dude.\n\nAnyways, [at this point in the comics](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=2304) Tedd is going through the realization that he is, in fact, genderfluid.

I've somewhat recently made peace with a queer/genderqueer identity. I've been questioning for a long time (longer than I even knew what questioning *was*) and my journey is likely still not done, but alas. 

I wanted to relay my life experiences in case it's helpful or relatable to anyone else.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails. 

On the other, I leave them plain. 


When I was very very young, I didn't know about gender, really. I was born, raised, and socialized male, but my best friend up until around the time of puberty was a female. This was literally never a point of contention and it was never something that I thought of as weird. It wasn't even a matter of looks - we were basically twins in appearance, and had similar hairstyles. People regularly confused us. 

About the time I hit puberty, I was fully aware of gender and sex and all of that. This was about the time I really fully appreciated all of the norms associated with gender.

But there was a problem with me.

One of these norms for men was that platonic relationships with women wasn't really permissible. It's understood that men are always seeking sex, no matter what, and that anything that appears to be friendship is just a really elaborate ploy *for* sex.

And whenever this stereotype came up, I always thought of my best friend (who sadly moved away by this point).

At no point was she a girl or a woman or female to me. She was just my friend. She liked the same dumb jokes I did. She liked to ride dirt bikes like I did. She liked to make jokes about me being dead when we went down to CVS and I'd put my arm in the blood pressure/heart rate monitoring machine and it'd recognize me as having a flat pulse and no blood pressure (because I used it incorrectly). 

She wasn't her gender. She was a person.

Something was wrong. Something didn't feel right. 

This was cognitive dissonance. 

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


A little bit later, I started to get into writing. But I had other interests - namely programming and music. Something that was fascinating to me early on was how differently I was perceived in different internet circles related to these. In programming circles I was immediately and irrevocably understood to be male. In music, it was a toss up - until people knew I played guitar. Then, male. In writing - writing was interesting. People who only knew my writing assumed I was female. 

Something was wrong here.

How could the same person, acting in the same way, come across as either male or female depending on the context?

I never corrected anyone when they assumed my gender.

I just got comfortable code switching between conversations where I was assumed to be male and where I was assumed to be female. 

Something didn't feel right.

I shouldn't be able to do this.

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


Around mid-late high school, I recognized I was attracted to ""both"" genders. I do not ever remember a point where I wasn't, and I always assumed growing up that everyone was like this. I dated both men and women. I never connected with either straight or queer communities. Consistently, both my straight and gay partners tried to downplay the side of me that was inconvenient to them. They were aghast at the idea of being attracted to both and insisted that it was a phase, a stepping stone, denial on my behalf (instead of theirs).

I accepted I was not like either group, and stayed away from identifying with either. Past the erasure of my identity, I was tremendously privileged and didn't have any issues dating who I wanted to. I never had to ""come out"". It just was.

But there was a problem.

In their unguarded, quiet moments, when only I was around, and we were both vulnerable, I didn't notice a difference between how men behaved and women behaved. We all had the same kinds of insecurities. We all had the same kinds of shit to do. We all had our (unique) challenges and benefits. I dated some men who were very emotional. I dated some men who never even frowned or smiled. I dated some women who loved fashion. I dated some women who just wore what was comfortable, and didn't understand what the big deal was. 

I couldn't use gender to reliably stereotype any individual. 

Something didn't feel right.

It should have been different.

All of the men I dated should have been flamboyant queens or stone-cold stoics. There is no in between. 

All of the women I dated should have been fragile and emotional. What are tomboys? 

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


By college, I entered in what I can only describe as my ""anarchism"" phase. I had come to the conclusion that gender was entirely bullshit and useless. The erasure of my bi identity had left me feeling similarly about orientations - useless bullshit. I presented as I did and acted as I did to make everyone else around me happy. I escaped into writing and reading frequently, where there was no limit on who I was.

I wasn't happy.

This was about the first time I met a trans person. 

Someone who is desperately cognizant of the gender binary, but is placed on the wrong end. 

I didn't accept the disphoria these people had. Gender is bullshit. Get over yourself. We all are uncomfortable with these stereotypes. You aren't special. 

Then that person committed suicide. 

I never directly said those things that I thought, but.

I could have.

That hasn't ever left me.

This binary was so important to them that not fitting on it correctly was cause for them to end their life.

Gender can't be both bullshit and so valuable.

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


When I started to work (I dropped out of college *to* work, one of many privileges of working in programming) I was full of dissonance. In my own experience, gender had been nothing but a confining box that told me how I should behave, invalidated my emotional complexity, and told me that half of my friendships were fake. But everyone else around me, online and off, found so much comfort in it. 

I finally connected with queer spaces, and met more trans people (and even one intersex). I found people who were (finally) willing to accept that bi is a thing.

My positions became less extreme.

Gender isn't bullshit.

It's just constructed. 

It's constructed like everything else in society.

But.

Like everything else in society, we use these norms for identity and shorthand. 

I had been so used to erasure and finding conflict in identities that I never fully appreciated this. 

When I talk to lesbians, they are so incredibly happy and proud of being a lesbian. When they talk with other lesbians, they immediately have something in common. There are entire communities built on nothing but this. This identity. 

This so far as I can tell is true for all of our social constructs. Gender, orientation, whatever. They're all constructed, but they're not bullshit. They're useful. Comforting. They give people a short hand for describing who they are and what they do (and sometimes, who they do). 

Gender isn't bullshit.

It's useful. Just it wasn't, to me.

This was cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.


After working for a few years, I decided, on a whim, to buy some women's clothes. I think maybe for Halloween. The why doesn't really matter anymore.

Whatever remaining biotruthy bullshit ideas I had floating around in my head about gender and sex were routinely and roundly smashed. 

At this point, I couldn't even really believe there was that huge a physical difference in bodies in the sexes. Obviously there's *some*, but it feels like these differences are severely over-stated. The clothes fit me fine. Women's bodies aren't magical. Men's bodies aren't magical. These are threads of fabric we've put together in a certain way. They aren't magical. They will fit you fine if you have the right size.

The intersex person in my life further confounded any biotruthy bullshit. They were AMAB but androgen insensitive. In other words, they had a penis, but were really absurdly feminine. Supposedly genitals and hormones are destiny, but this truly is the most damning to this essentialism. They started taking estrogen and ""passed"" as a woman effortlessly. Her body was never male, not really. It was just missing some of the hormones it always needed. 

Gender doesn't determine genitals. Genitals don't determine hormones. Hormones can be changed.

No part of this essentialism works.


I wore women's clothes more often.

I was always jealous that there was so much more variety.

I wore it mixed with men's clothes, though. 

Men's clothes are warmer and have pockets.

I like being warm and having pockets.

I started to wear makeup.

I didn't do it to look like a woman.

I did it to make other people uncomfortable.

I wanted them, everyone, to understand this weird dissonance. To experience it first hand. I wanted to look as androgynous as possible, and challenge everyone's expectations of how I would act.

But I was above this shit. Some powder on my face wasn't going to impact me.


So, I didn't expect that I would one day look in the mirror and see a woman looking back at me. 

I didn't expect to even further see that woman after the powder was gone.

I didn't expect to see either a man or a woman in the mirror based on, so far as I can tell, fucking nothing, but a whim.

Here I am, having spent all of this time coming to the conclusion that gender was irrelevant to me, and I can't even escape it privately. 

It's so ingrained. 

On one hand, I paint all of my nails.

On the other, I leave them plain.

I do it because I can look down and see one hand as female, and the other as male. I can put them both side by side and cognitively understand that I am projecting gender onto something that doesn't even fucking make sense since it's the same goddamn hands except for a little bit of paint. 

But I project anyway, and I can't stop my mind from doing it. 

Maybe some day I'll stop projecting.

I'm not holding my breath, though.

The why doesn\'t really matter anymore.\n\nWhatever remaining biotruthy bullshit ideas I had floating around in my head about gender and sex were routinely and roundly smashed. \n\nAt this point, I couldn\'t even really believe there was that huge a physical difference in bodies in the sexes. Obviously there\'s *some*, but it feels like these differences are severely over-stated. The clothes fit me fine. Women\'s bodies aren\'t magical. Men\'s bodies aren\'t magical. These are threads of fabric we\'ve put together in a certain way. They aren\'t magical. They will fit you fine if you have the right size.\n\nThe intersex person in my life further confounded any biotruthy bullshit. They were AMAB but androgen insensitive. In other words, they had a penis, but were really absurdly feminine. Supposedly genitals and hormones are destiny, but this truly is the most damning to this essentialism. They started taking estrogen and ""passed"" as a woman effortlessly. Her body was never male, not really. It was just missing some of the hormones it always needed. \n\nGender doesn\'t determine genitals. Genitals don\'t determine hormones. Hormones can be changed.\n\nNo part of this essentialism works.\n\n\nI wore women\'s clothes more often.\n\nI was always jealous that there was so much more variety.\n\nI wore it mixed with men\'s clothes, though. \n\nMen\'s clothes are warmer and have pockets.\n\nI like being warm and having pockets.\n\nI started to wear makeup.\n\nI didn\'t do it to look like a woman.\n\nI did it to make other people uncomfortable.\n\nI wanted them, everyone, to understand this weird dissonance. To experience it first hand. I wanted to look as androgynous as possible, and challenge everyone\'s expectations of how I would act.\n\nBut I was above this shit. Some powder on my face wasn\'t going to impact me.\n\n\nSo, I didn\'t expect that I would one day look in the mirror and see a woman looking back at me. \n\nI didn\'t expect to even further see that woman after the powder was gone.\n\nI didn\'t expect to see either a man or a woman in the mirror based on, so far as I can tell, fucking nothing, but a whim.\n\nHere I am, having spent all of this time coming to the conclusion that gender was irrelevant to me, and I can\'t even escape it privately. \n\nIt\'s so ingrained. \n\nOn one hand, I paint all of my nails.\n\nOn the other, I leave them plain.\n\nI do it because I can look down and see one hand as female, and the other as male. I can put them both side by side and cognitively understand that I am projecting gender onto something that doesn\'t even fucking make sense since it\'s the same goddamn hands except for a little bit of paint. \n\nBut I project anyway, and I can\'t stop my mind from doing it. \n\nMaybe some day I\'ll stop projecting.\n\nI\'m not holding my breath, though.\n\n\nOn one hand, I paint my nails.\n\nOn the other, I leave them plain.\n\n[I like it better that way.](http://imgur.com/a/DHVMM)\n\nMy identities are still somewhat damaged and somewhat erased, somewhat bled together.\n\nBut I like it that way.\n\nI like it queer.

152,2017-01-31 19:33:38,5rae4s,20,23,"Hello everyone. :) I am happy to get fistbumps of solidarity from anyone who wants to offer them, but I would like advice on this issue only from users who have experience in speaking a gendered language please (like the Romance languages). If you only speak English then I'm afraid any shouts of ""DTMFA"" are going to be politely ignored.

Summary: I'm nonbinary AFAB but Romance languages force me to pick a default gender, so I picked male - and now a year later it transpires that my native-Romance-speaking partner feels very uncomfortable with me presenting as default-male when in his country with him or to his family; while I feel very uncomfortable with presenting as default-female in any context. It's coming to a head because I'm going to meet his mother this year and he's been letting her assume I'm a woman. What do I do?

Hi folks. I am a nonbinary English human and my partner of 18 months grew up with a Romance language as his native tongue. His English is excellent, and I am slowly learning his language. Our use of his language is probably about 10% in our written messages and less than 1% when speaking and listening.

Naturally there are difficulties around my pronouns - in English I go by singular they/them, and my partner uses these pronouns consistently with no problems. Of course there is no Romance equivalent, but since there's no need for him to use a gendered pronoun for me when he's speaking to me, it's not been much of an issue.

I did do some research, and it seems that most genderqueer folks who grow up speaking a Romance language tend to stick with the same Romance pronouns that everyone has always used for them since they were born. To switch to the opposite pronouns would mean making a huge change for no real benefit, since the new pronouns would still not reflect their gender correctly. Many genderqueer folks raised with Romance languages say they hate using their native tongue for this very reason, because they cannot avoid being misgendered.

I was assigned female at birth, and there is no disguising my ample hips and bust so I just dress very masculine in an attempt to compensate my way to a middle ground. Most days I look like a butch lesbian stereotype. I am addressed as a woman by strangers 99.9% of the time and there is not much I can do about it without getting surgery, which I don't want. So I just try to confuse or forestall people's instinct to call me (for example) ""that lady over there"" as much as possible, such as with my men's clothes and my very short hair. Occasionally someone will call me ""sir/mate"" and then do a double-take and correct themselves to ""madam/love"". Sometimes very small children think I am a man. These things make me happy because they show me I'm succeeding at least a little in presenting ambiguously.

So when I started learning my partner's language 18 months ago, I opted to interact with it as if I were a man, in order to help me present neutrally or ambiguously. My partner seemed on board with this at the time, and so I just assumed he was referring to me in the masculine when talking about me in his own language, until the last time I went to visit him. While I was there he got a call from his mother, whom I've never met, and then it all came out. He's been referring to me in the feminine with his family this whole time. He hasn't even told them I'm genderqueer. He says it would be very difficult for them to understand because they speak a language where everything is gendered so they have no concept of gender-neutral even for objects, let alone for people. And he's now feeling really weird about the prospect of telling them about my gender identity and then switching to talking about me in the masculine, not because he thinks his family will be bigoted about it - he is very sure they will not be unpleasant about it no matter how confused they are - but simply because talking about me as if I were a man ""just feels wrong"" to him. (Apparently, talking about me as if I were a woman does not. *wince* *sadface*)

His mother is visiting in the summer and I'm supposed to be meeting her, and she doesn't speak much English so a significant amount of our conversations will be in their language. My partner and I have just had a conversation about the issue of my pronouns in said language for a second time. I made it clear both times that I don't care if his mother refers to me in the feminine, as I have to deal with ""she/her/madam"" from strangers all the time and I'd be constantly upset if I didn't learn not to internalise it. But my relationship with my partner is much more personal and I do not want him to refer to me in the feminine, at least not anywhere where I will hear or read it, as it will make me really upset. I want him to use masculine pronouns for me when we are together with his mother, or with any other speaker of his language. He is clearly very uncomfortable with what I'm asking. But I am not at all comfortable with consenting to be put back in the feminine box by someone so important to me.

If he was having trouble accepting my chosen pronouns in English, I would be sitting him down for a come-to-Jesus meeting about how yes, using a different pronoun for someone does feel very strange and uncomfortable at first, but it does get better with practice, and he frankly  needs to choose between using uncomfortable pronouns for his partner or using comfortable pronouns for his ex. But we have no problems at all in English. In his language, I'm less sure of myself and I'm worried that I'm missing something important about the cultural and/or linguistic context. Is there another angle from which I should try to approach this conversation before getting really firm about what I will and won't accept in terms of pronouns?

Or - Am I just being unreasonable? Should I suck it up and deal with using the pronouns attached to my assigned gender like nonbinary native speakers of Romance languages? Am I creating this problem by not being respectful enough towards the conventions of the language I'm learning?

I would love to gather some insight on creative ways to make my genderfluid cis-female partner feel as attractive as I find her to be! We've been friends for a while and are now working toward a more physical and emotionally serious relationship. I would so appreciate, for example, suggestions of questions to ask that show I care (and perhaps things to avoid if you can think of common sensitive stereotypes or hurtful inquiries I might not be aware of). 

Also, I just love her originality and trying things with her that are new for me, but she often hesitates or grows very nervous when it comes to sexual situations. I really want to cultivate a safe space for us! Suggestions for compliments or ways/actions to show her how sexy I find her would be incredibly helpful. 

FTR, I am a cis-female femme, and again she is cis-female genderfluid. She prefers female pronouns but sexually prefers neutral or slightly masculine compliments (i.e. ""Strong"" or ""dashing"") and exhibits a more dominant sexuality.

We\'ve been friends for a while and are now working toward a more physical and emotionally serious relationship. I would so appreciate, for example, suggestions of questions to ask that show I care (and perhaps things to avoid if you can think of common sensitive stereotypes or hurtful inquiries I might not be aware of). \n\nAlso, I just love her originality and trying things with her that are new for me, but she often hesitates or grows very nervous when it comes to sexual situations. I really want to cultivate a safe space for us! Suggestions for compliments or ways/actions to show her how sexy I find her would be incredibly helpful. \n\nFTR, I am a cis-female femme, and again she is cis-female genderfluid. She prefers female pronouns but sexually prefers neutral or slightly masculine compliments (i.e. ""Strong"" or ""dashing"") and exhibits a more dominant sexuality. \n\nThank you so much!

And as I've come to accept my non-cis identity lately, things have become more clear to me and my depression has lessen a bit. Until a month ago I still felt like I really wanted to be a girl and start hrt, but two weeks ago I suddenly start to feel ""normal"", like I can just keep being a guy for the rest of my life (probably because I met a girl that I really like and so I thought I will be better off staying a male). Before I sometimes thought that I could keep being a guy as well, but this time it's REAL. Before I never liked it seeing myself wearing male clothing and my masculine body, but recently I'm COMPLETELY ok with it. 



But for the past two days my feeling has fluctuated the most. I will wake up, touching my hair and feel like a girl, then have breakfast and feel like a guy, and change back to a girl, back and forth like this... And this is what made me realize that I might be genderfluid, and it feels more ""right"" than calling myself a trans.



So now the question is, should I start HRT? 


I ALWAYS want to be a girl, its just that sometimes the desire isnt as strong and I feel like being a guy is ok, and sometimes its not there at all. But even then, I'd still prefer to be a girl, its just a matter of whether I feel like I can settle living as a guy. And my dysphoria about my male body comes and goes as well, it used to be there all the time, recently it started to fluctuate.


So basically, the ideal situation for me is to be a biological female, but sometimes being more masculine sometimes being more feminine. I used to feel really confused about this, I still like to look cool as a girl, and act tough and manly, but still have feminine features like long hair, breasts and curves. 



If someone can make me a girl with magic, I would do it without hesitation. So the reason that Im still struggling with starting hrt or not is how life will be tougher and I might not be able to pass. Sometimes my dysphoria is real bad that I dont care about these and I just want to transition. Sometimes its not there as much and I feel like even tho it sounds good, I dont know if it will worth it.



TL;DR:     I know no one can make the decision for me, so I just wanna know how other genderfluid people deal with this? Sometimes it feels ok to keep being your assigned gender and you are glad that you never start HRT, but some other times you want it so bad but also worry that you might regret it once you feelings change back... Part of me want to start hrt tomorrow as I fear that the chance for me passing is getting lower and lower, but the other part of me worries that I might regret it... not because of the feminine changes but the tough future, the reality.
