I must admit that I am not a trans man, or anything other than what I am (whatever it is I am), although I have some secondhand insight.

Log on to okcupid, a woman visited my profile recently. Her image is that of herself dressed up as a zombie, this intrigues me, and I notice she has more images like that, so I message her saying her zombie pics were awesome. I didn't even expect a reply, she lives in Belgium anyway (I live in the US)

She sends me an IM almost immediately saying ""Braaaaaiiiiiinnnnnssssss"", that right there already made my day. I reply with a similar thing and we chat a bit about the nature of zombies. I think to myself this is pretty damn awesome and cute. We continue talking, sharing music interests and such, I'm looking at the questions she answered and one of them is ""Would you date someone who has changed their gender"" and her answer is ""I am planning to/have changed my gender""

I just kind of go O_o being a transsexual myself who did not in any way notice that she looked any different than any other girl. At the same time she says she wants to tell me a secret, and I ask what, and she says we share our pasts, and I ask her if she is a transsexual.

Well, she is! Not only is she incredibly amazing looking (She's 23 mind you), she's post op and got SRS 4 months after starting hormones. Her ex boyfriend paid for the surgery! Now she's a part time model and she goes out on saturday with her friends in 19th century clothing just to explore and have amazing fun.

She dated her photos for me and she was incredibly amazingly passable in such a way that I never would have guessed even when she was only at 3 months of hormones. Her advice to me is to not let transitioning rule my life and to just live it.

I'm at 5-6 months of hormones, I try very hard to pass, I have almost no hope anymore of ever getting the surgery since its so damn expensive.

I know others are worse off than me and didn't get to start even hormones as young as me (I'm 20), but I can't help but wonder whether to be happy for her or incredibly fucking angry at the world for being so damn unfair. I want to run to every mirror in this house and slam it against the wall. I've never been so insanely jealous and enraged in my entire life.

EDIT: The comments and other facts have caused me to have an epiphany. Consider me thoroughly cheered up.

What ever you want to be is what ever you should be. If you are that thing, it matters not whether your outward appearance confirms to everyone that you are that thing. All that matters is that you look the way you want to look. So apply as much effort to yourself as you wish, and there is no reason to be upset over what you have not or may not accomplish as long as you remember that you are who you are, and you are in control of your self if you allow yourself to be.

I began my transition in early 2006, so I guess he was around 2 at the time.  When he was 4-5ish I stopped my transition for various reasons (so late 2008ish).  It took me 2 years to realize that no matter how hard I tried, I'd never be happy living as a guy.  So in January of this year I re-started transitioning. 

Ok so that's my background.  Now for the story.  Lately (as in the last 2 months or so) my 7yo son has been expressing a lot of interest in what he thinks are feminine/girly things.  Today he came into my room wearing mascara (messy but adorable).  He's been asking for ""girl"" toys for Christmas, and even told me he's thought of a new name.

He knows that no matter what he does I'm going to be supportive of him, and so I'm glad he feels comfortable enough talking with me about it.  

I'm concerned that he's experimenting with it because my transition has influenced him (obviously, but I didn't expect this particular event).  At the same time though, there's the possibly that he just feels comfortable enough talk to me about it just because he knows I'll be open-minded about it due to my personal transition.  And since correlation does not equal causation I need to allow for the possibility that it's not just a phase (in order to get him any help he'd need if that was the case.)

So yeah, since this is a rather unique subject, I'd be curious to hear any thoughts or advice about what I might be able to do to help understand his feelings better.
