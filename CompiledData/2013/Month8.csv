My aim is to document our existence in the world with a collection that reaffirms our varied selves to each other and helps others to understand. I am reaching out to the internet to get in touch with as many people as possible who want to have their voices and stories preserved and shared with the world.
I am requesting submissions that document your own life and experiences as a non-binary person, or that of a non-binary person you know. Share whatever you feel comfortable! You can write a sentence or a novella. I’m including some prompts below; you can answer all, or some, or none in your response. Responses may be published, but will all be anonymous. I will be publishing responses on this project’s tumblr, as well as an edited (for brevity and obvious spelling mistakes only) e-book and hard-copy version.
I thank y’all so much in advance for your contributions! You can get updates about this project at nonbinaryhistories.tumblr.com (recently created, nothing there as of writing this). We gotta stand for each other, y’all.

Responses will be published anonymously in print and online. If you would like to be identified, please include your initials and/or location as you would like it to be listed.

Prompts to answer or not answer as you wish! These are just some ideas to get you thinking about what you would like to share:
Describe your gender identity.
How do you like to present yourself?
What do you say to strangers who misgender you? What do you wish you could say?
What does ‘transitioning’ mean to/for you?
What goals do you have about your gender identity?
What pronouns do you use?
Describe when/how you first realized you were non-binary.
Did you realize that you were not your assigned gender before you realized you were non-binary?
What are some authors/books/influences that have shaped your ideas about gender?
What makes your identity feel validated? Invalidated?
What does being non-binary mean to you?
What changes would you like to see in the way society perceives non-binary people?
Do you experience dysphoria? What is it like for you?
How do you feel when you look in the mirror? What do you want to see?
Describe a time when a stranger made you feel validated about your gender identity.
Describe a time when you realized something important about/related to your gender identity.
Describe a relationship you have with someone who supports your gender identity and what that means.
Describe how you feel when you are at your best/strongest (or worst/weakest).
What ideas or wishes do you have about the future of gender?
Again, please write about whatever you want – these are just some ideas. Don’t worry if you feel like you are not a great writer – putting our feelings into words is hard and you are awesome just for putting your awesome self out there!

Now, to why I wanted to post.
I made the conscious decision to come out to one of my roommates yesterday. One already knew, but the other didn't.
She(The one that didn't know)  received it very well, and responded just as well. She informed me that she didn't care what I was, and that she would be my friend regardless. (She's like a mother to me) She told me I cold dress how I wanted to, and that she wouldn't judge me for it.

My next step is to come out to my family. It's very risky, since my sister's part of the family is very 'God' oriented. My father is very old fashioned, and doesn't seem very accepting of the LGBTQ community.  
I know coming out to my dad and sister won't be very easy. I'm afraid  more of how my sister will handle it, because I love my two nephews a lot, and I don't want to be cut off from them. My dad I'm still worried about, but there's a slight bit less riding on how he reacts compared to my sister.

I'm not trans, but I am bisexual, so I am part of (if only in a small way) part of the LGBT community, and I find that I have mixed emotions regarding everything regarding Chelsea's announcement.

On one side she deserves to live life as she feels most comfortable, but on the other side I feel like the announcement comes at a very delicate time and threatens to give ample ammunition to the transphobes in much of the news world. Rather than focusing on the whistleblowing on its moral/ethical basis, I'm worried that her actions will be overshadowed by her gender identity and that it'll all be dismissed as ""someone really confused and emotionally unstable"" rather than examining the two situations (the whistleblowing and the switch from man to woman). I almost feel like she should have waited a bit longer, let the media storm die down before making the announcement, rather than doing it now and running the risk of further marginalizing the trans community. 

What does everyone think? As someone looking in from the outside, its easy for me to have a more critical opinion because I lack the same empathy for the situation that you all share, and there is a much greater impact of an announcement regarding gender identity than sexual preference, so my effort at putting myself in your shoes is ineffective at best.

39,2013-08-25 06:56:09,1l1ob8,10,7,"So first off this is from a cell phone so pardon the obvious side effects. 

I. . .  I really dont know what to say.  I cant stop thinking about the possibility of living as a woman.  (I am currently male).  If I have free time to think, I wonder how family would react.  Friends.  What would change about life.  i fantasize about magical events that would leave me female.  Winning the lottery and using the money for procedures.  Becoming my dark souls character XD  Let me just put out my own list of I guess pros and cons.  

Pros.
I think I would be happier with myself.  
I think I would be more comfortable.
I would spend less time thinking about how much life will suck as a male.
I wouldn't have to sneak into my moms room to look at her clothes and wish I would look halfway nice in them, if I could ever wear them.  
I wouldnt find thinking of the future so absolutely depressing and frustrating.  
Generally probably being just happier and more content with myself

Cons
My parents are lds.  I have no idea how they would react.  Probably try to convince me I am wrong then argue then quote scripture and in the end my mom would be crying and everyone would be awkward if not straight up angry at me.  Except my brother.  He would be the chill one...
I have no monetary way to do any sort of hormone therapy or buy new clothes or do any kind of surgery.  That also means no money for a councillor (probably spelled wrong) or anything like that, hence dr. Reddit...
Social stigmas in getting jobs, houses, or just living.  
My friends. . .  I know a few of them would be put off to say the least.
The fact I would make an ugly woman with body hair and being overweight and all that crap.  (Though overweight is kinda improving I guess)
And lastly, I am attracted to girls, so throw being a lesbian on top of trans.


I dont know.  I dont understand what I think or feel or what.  All I know is that the weight of the whole thing is suffocating and I dont know if its just me being silly or if I actually feel this way.  Fuck this all sounds so cheesy.  I dont know what to do about feeling this way.  My mentality so far has been ignore it it will go away or I will move on.  
Well that changed for me when I picture my future and contemplate if my current future is worth anything.  Then I think about alternatives.  

If all this just sounds like normal teenage angst, just tell me so I can try to move on from it.  I dont know.  If its real, well I still dont know. 
If this isnt the right subreddit, sorry.  I generally lurk so this is new.  For a lot of reasons.

Edit: 
Just wanted to give you guys an update and thank you again for your help.  I feel I am transgender, and will hopefully be able to talk to a school councillor about it this year, as well as my brother and one of my friends.  
Again, thank you guys/girls so much for the help.  I was pretty sure that if I didnt tell anybody about my feelings I would suffocate.  ♡

1,2013-08-01 20:50:32,1jiq2v,9,21,"I started questioning my gender a few years ago. I remember one night in highschool having an epiphany that I must be gay, and then the next morning I felt completely different, and it's been like that ever since. I know I'm not gay now, I'm pretty comfortable saying that my sexuality is bisexual and that I'm mostly attracted to girls, but occasionally to guys as well. However, I've been trying to ignore the issues I have with my gender (and you can probably guess how that turns out...).

The past year has been me living as I always have and ignoring it, and then it all came flooding back in the past couple of weeks. So, I've decided to start checking out the lgbt scene where I live and try to find a therapist to talk to about all of this.

I feel more feminine at times, and I want to explore that more, and I started by ordering some clothes and dressing up for the first time. It was nice, but when I looked at myself in the mirror I couldn't help but feel out of place. I have to wonder if this is more of a sexual thing (it does get me off a little bit..) and not really who I am.

Really, I feel like I don't want to have to separate sides of myself. I don't want to dress up in private and be a guy in public. I want to blend the two fluidly, because that's what I feel like. Wear makeup, maybe some androgynous clothing, keep it subtle, maybe push it sometimes... but whenever I have gone out wearing eye liner and blush (about a year ago now) I felt so awkward and out of place. It doesn't help that my voice is very masculine, as is my way of talking, and I don't want to change that a huge amount.

I'm not sure if this is just normal hesitance or a sign that I'm acting out of some repressed urge and swinging so far the other direction that it's not really me either. I know I'm afraid, I've always been afraid to just be me and be looked down on, but I don't want to let that control me anymore. I just want to figure out who I am and be that person.

I have to wonder if this is more of a sexual thing (it does get me off a little bit..) and not really who I am.\n\nReally, I feel like I don't want to have to separate sides of myself. I don't want to dress up in private and be a guy in public. I want to blend the two fluidly, because that's what I feel like. Wear makeup, maybe some androgynous clothing, keep it subtle, maybe push it sometimes... but whenever I have gone out wearing eye liner and blush (about a year ago now) I felt so awkward and out of place. It doesn't help that my voice is very masculine, as is my way of talking, and I don't want to change that a huge amount.\n\nI'm not sure if this is just normal hesitance or a sign that I'm acting out of some repressed urge and swinging so far the other direction that it's not really me either. I know I'm afraid, I've always been afraid to just be me and be looked down on, but I don't want to let that control me anymore. I just want to figure out who I am and be that person.\n\nSo I guess, tl;dr, is it normal to feel awkward when you first start exploring your gender?"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Do you ever feel awkward?', 'created': 1375415432.0}",

9,2013-08-05 15:56:53,1jqv3z,7,6,"Hey,

I am a 29 year old guy, married with 2 kids, and I'm pretty confused :(

Quick back story, used to try on my sisters and mothers clothes and underwear when I was a teenager, i've thought for a while that it was just a sex thing for me then, but thinking about it more I clearly remember wanting to always wear womens underwear, always wanted to go to sleep in them and wake up in the morning wearing them instead of boxers, but was terrified that my Mum or Dad would pop their head in at night to check on me and see, if the covers had fallen off or something. 

I joined the army when I was 19 and didnt really crossdress at all for years, fantasised about it, but never doing it, then when I was 26 I left the forces, met my wife and got married, had kids etc, I told my wife all about this, and she encouraged it, still does, saying that she loves me for who I am, not INSPITE of who I am, which is awesome , we've done so much in the past 4 or 5 years, and she's really made me slowly start to creap out of my shell, we go out shopping together for clothes, i've been out a few times fully dressed and made up, been to a MAC counter in guy mode and sat getting a foundation match in a packed dept store, started shaving my legs for a while and then actually started going out with shorts on + shaven legs, grown my hair long and started going to work in a ponytail, and this weekend, went and got ourselves some matching tattoo's, hers on her upper back and mine in a very sexy + feminine position on my hip, which I love!! This is all sounds great, and it would be, but its confusing the hell out of me, because I just don't feel like a guy, I get jealous of almost every attractive woman I see, its not the normal guy thoughts though, I want to BE them, not be IN them, is the easiest and bluntest (sorry) way I can put it :( I watch my wife getting dressed and I'm jealous of her curves and breasts and long thick hair that always looks good, she's said it before and I can't ever deny it, because its true, I want to be her. 

Not related to my gender confusedness, but kinda because it shows a lot about my personality, I've also always wanted to hook up with guys, talking to them on good ol' AOL chat when I was younger and arranging to meet up but then bottling it, I joined the army when I was 19 and spent much of my early 20's in the following cycle on nights out every weekend, go out with friends and get drunk, slink off to a nearby gay bar and hang around outside scared to go in in-case I knew anyone in there, go back home and immediately get on webcams for guys, arrange to meet up, bottle it incase anyone found out, rinse and repeat.

I've always been painfully shy, and pretty socially awkward at times, always terrified of other peoples opinions and what they would do or say about the things that I like/wore etc. I think i'm starting to shake this now, with a lot of help from my wife, I recently went for a day out to a farm with my little girl, wearing some skinny jeans, a long, blatantly womens, cardigan and my hair tied back and put in some plaits, something which I would NEVER have done as little as a year ago, i really feel like I'm finding myself, but I'm not sure who that person is. 

In a perfect world I'd have a smooth stubble free face, with a curvy shape and some boobs, which makes me sound trans, and for a while I thought I was (going on depression meds after imagining killing myself on the commute most mornings, and getting lost staring into a mirror thinking about stabbing my adams apple with some tweezers!), but I don't think I feel like a woman! :( and transition is also something I don't know if I could ever go through with, unless I was holding a gun to my head every night, but that won't happen as I am not desperately unhappy as a guy, and I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about coming out into the open with all that and being out there for friends and family to disown and the world to laugh and stare at as I pass in the street.

I kinda wish there was a button that I could press where I wake up as a woman tomorrow, with my relationship intact, and my work colleageus acting like I have always turned up to work in a skirt and heels :(

And thats my rant done, there's no conclusion, I'm not even sure if I'm asking anything in particular, I'd just really like some advice on this if possible.

Thanks

Initially, this was because I felt genderfluid and I preferred to use an umbrella term to describe myself. However, I've realised that when I'm not in an environment with lots of social interaction (such as school), I feel as though gender doesn't exist. It just doesn't manifest itself in any form.


This led me on to thinking that gender is a social construct, but this isn't the case, as I've had mild gender dysphoria before. Instead I started to look at what it means to be a man or a woman (excluding sex), and I can't bring up any concrete answers. The only answers I can think of are that they are terms to define how people act socially in relation to masculinity and femininity.


What I want to know is:

* what is gender without masculinity and femininity?
* what does it mean to be male or female (excluding sex)?
* are there other things than masculinity and femininity?


Now I don't feel as either male or female, as I did before. I feel disconnected to both, and I don't know whether to consider myself as third-gendered, agender, or to even bother with a label for my gender.

There are times when I feel like I'm faking, do any of you feel the same way? Like I don't particularly want to have top surgery, most of the time. I often feel like I'm exaggerating my feelings and dysphoria, like maybe I""m not actually feeling it as strongly as I make myself believe I am, which just makes feeling it all the worse. It's like ""Oh, I really want to compress my tits and wear men's scents and have a packer"" but the next day I may be perfectly fine looking female (increasingly rare).

Some days (like recently), just looking at a naked male is enough to set off the ""I hate myself and my body"" feelings. Especially if it's a fit male. I'm nearly 100 lbs overweight and I lack the willpower to effectively lose weight consistently (I've lost 45lbs over the past year, though, which is something), so I feel like crap when I think about it.

I envy MTF or feminine GQ or trans individuals, because you seem so much better represented in the community. Every day I see something about an MFT or feminine individual on some subreddit or another, often multiple ones at the same exact time. And I envy you and I resent it, as bad as it makes me feel to resent it. I try to offer help on here to as many MTF/feminine people as possible, but it's draining when the masculine/FTM group is so underrepresented. I feel bad about it, but I can't help but feel bitter about it when I see these posts.

I also feel bitter against the FTM community, because it's all about passing as a stereotypical male, but I'm not a stereotypical male. I have long, curly, thick hair and I love it, I don't want to get rid of it. If I were thin, I'd like the freedom to sometimes wear bikinis or other incredibly feminine clothing, while still having the freedom to portray myself as incredibly masculine if I was feeling that way on that day. 

I don't fit into any category I've seen as of now and it's so draining I often don't know what to do. I write about it, my most recent character is a transguy who I haven't had the chance to fully explore, but right now even writing him is draining because he gets to do what I can't, though at the same time I want to be able to switch between a male and female body at will. It's just incredibly difficult to think straight when I can't come up with a concrete idea of what I want my physical body to look like, and I needed to rant and stuff about it. Maybe some of you have had similar experiences or feelings and can relate, that'd be nice.

I'm biologically female, but I'm working on transitioning to be more androgynous. I am ""absolutely fucking adorable"" apparently, or the way most people say it ""cute"". I don't mind being told that I'm cute or having my cuteness talked about, as long as it's just a short mention and then on to another topic. It also doesn't bother me as much when I'm called cute without being compared to any archetype of cute, where the subtext is left up to interpretation. That way, I can at least pretend it's a more gender-neutral or even masculine form of cute.

The thing that really gets to me is when conversation focuses on my cuteness for too long, or when I'm compared to particularly girly archetypes for cute (like shirly temple), or when it has do do with how cute I was with longer hair, etc. etc. Anyway, after a point it starts sounding less like compliments and more like mean-spirited teasing. Worse yet, these comparisons remind me of all of the things I like least about my body, all of the things I desperately wish I could change.

Last night I actually ended up leaving a gathering of friend--all but in a huff--because I felt so insulted and humiliated. At the time, however, my friends thought that they were complimenting me, or, at worst, participating in some light-hearted teasing.

Clothing is a strong form of self-expression. As a MAAB, I find it hard to express myself using the conventional male clothing.

Every male has a (mostly black/gray/brown/blue) T-shirt and denim pants on and that's all. There are a very few designs to choose from, a narrow variety of colors and I don't want to fit in. I would like to wear colorful things, t-shirts with vibrant-colored patterns, rainbow-striped long socks, or loosy sheer dress on a warm day. But wearing any of these things draws way too much attention from the surrounding (and I still have some social anxiety about that).

I don't want to dress as a woman. I want that these forms of cloting not to be considered female-only. I want the same freedom for men what every woman have. (And the same rights for the woman, that every man have. Feminism, ftw!)

It seems to me, that the role of the genders in our society is considered far too much important, that it really is. Males and females are seeing each other as they were different species. But the biological differences are pretty small. I dream of a genderless society.

I never felt being masculine the way the society showed me. I like my own male body, my only problem is my social gender. I simply hate the gender-binary.

Luckily, I moved to a different country previous year and started experimenting more with my gender. I wore skirts out in the public, I slowly, partly came out to even closer friends of mine. I enjoy the support of ~~my~~ an amazing girlfriend, who understands and supports me. I began to feel, what looks good (or at least: okay) on me.

I like to push the limits slowly; if I am wearing a skirt, then I avoid the bright colors to compensate the ""weirdness"" some way. The more important people I meet, the harder it gets to show myself.

Finally, I share some pictures with you, dear redditors. And no, I'm not creating a throwaway account. http://imgur.com/a/0Sqzd

Hey everyone,

I'm Dogenwolf, a guy who upon serious and lengthy consideration of the nature of genderqueers and genderfluid persons have finally arrived at the conclusion: This describes me and always has. I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to know that there is a word that describes my gender identities (plural).

I was born male but growing up always felt most comfortable alternating my dress between both genders and sometimes blending the two. I always felt a bit alienated even from my gay friends who were certain about their gender; even the guys who wear makeup when they go out to the club always identified as being very much male. I never knew what it meant to have a fixed perception of your own gender and now that I have a rudimentary understand of the term genderqueer, and a greater understanding of myself, I am *grateful* that I don't have a fixed gender identity.

I feel liberated, freed from my own expectations of gender conformity. I don't have to think of myself as a man or a woman because I am and can be all permutations of what those words mean to me, up to and including their total absence.

Two weeks ago I felt my identity shift towards the feminine and I followed the tide out. A week ago I felt a shift towards the masculine and I followed the tide back in. I no longer fight it, I move with it and it is *magic.* **I** am magic.

I also find that it's given me more security when it comes to my sexuality as well and I feel more inclined to investigate those parts of my sexuality that I felt were improper. I feel more secure with myself, so I feel no shame in them and, in fact, am proud and excited to be who I am, whoever that may be at any given time. It's fitting that I'm a Pisces (mutable water sign), too. The most notorious unstable sign, but I've found that in embracing my unstable identity I have found something incredibly stable and predictable.

----------

**The Growing Use of Mx as a Gender-inclusive Title in the UK** - Version 1.8 - 2013-08-16

Mx was created as a standard title without convey gender connotations, and can be used by anyone. It follows the M* pattern: Mr, Ms, Mx. It doesn't require a qualification or career as Dr and Rev do. The x represents a wildcard character that removes gender. The title is pronounced Mux or Mix.

Example: Mx Sam Smith.

The following pages provide evidence of well-known companies and organisations accepting and offering Mx as a gender-inclusive title at the time of writing. The earliest example of a major company accepting Mx in this document is by the Post Office in October 2009.

As someone who's identified as a gay man for many years, I haven't really begun to question my gender identity until just recently, and decided to turn here for a bit of guidance.

Currently, I'm just beginning to explore my own feelings on the matter. 

In a short and synoptic sentence, to be blunt, as a biological male, I have never really felt the same sort of affinity towards my genitals that others seem to feel. I have, quite frequently throughout my life, searched up about the likes of castration and vasectomies without any anxiety about the idea; infact, viewing the possibility in a positive manner.

When it comes to my genitals, I'm quite ambivalent - I have, even as a gay man, had occasional experiences of autogynephilia; however, although I feel I would feel more natural without my male genitals, I have yet to feel comfortable enough to take the chop to them.

Additionally, in spite of the occasional autogynephilia, I feel that I would still always identify as a man - and looking as a man, perhaps slightly more androgynous, is how I would like to remain.

I'm a POC (person of color) and FAAB. People would call me a 'tomboy' but I don't think they have any idea how deeply my feelings actually go.


I'm walking home with another POC in my department, we live in the same apartment complex. I invite him in, we're sitting at my kitchen table talking while my two other roommates are sitting in my living room watching Nip/Tuck and honestly, talking to us too.


The conversation was going fine, he's from NYC, I'm from Maryland, and we were mostly talking about our families, what we liked in television, movies, whatever. I honest to god don't even remember how it was brought up, but the topic of feminine gay men, was introduced by him. He even said, “I'm a little bit homophobic.” He explained to me how they made him feel uncomfortable and weird. He tried to defend his opinion, by saying “But you know, I have no problem with masculine gay men, just guys who paint their  nails and wear purses and shit.” And I'm sitting there kind of like, huh. Up until now I liked you. Let's see if I can change your mind.


So I try to dig deeper to understand why he doesn't like feminine gay men. I try to explain to him that gender expression and sexuality are two completely different things. As I was doing this, he'd try to challenge me with questions or statements, 


“Well what, are you into girls?”

“Well I have no problem with how you are,”

“You must be a feminist, aren't you.”

“Wait, what, you painted your ex-boyfriend's nails? Really?”


I replied, “So what if I'm into girls?” I'm not, I'm into men almost exclusively. Pretty sure I'm a 1 on the Kinsey scale, it takes a lot for me to be into women. And I had an ex who I would take with me to get pedicures. He loved them, and when we'd go (since I paid) I always had the caveat that since I was paying, I got to pick the color. I picked pink almost every single time. “So you have absolutely no problem with me as a masculine woman, or a tomboy, but you have a problem with men who are feminine?” After I presented all of my arguments and that last question, he was able to admit that it was a hypocritical opinion and he should probably work on it. That made me feel better, but I was still frustrated. Being biracial, I find it shameful if I run into another POC who doesn't support anyone else who's basically, non-conventional. Whether another race, religion, under the queer umbrella, what have you.


I politely walked him to the door at 10 so I could shower, but when I came back I was frustrated and complaining to my roommates, only to learn from one of them that she also doesn't like gays (men? Lesbians? I didn't ask and I quickly left to shower).


I really want to understand why gay men (and feminine gay men) bother the two of them, one because I'll see him for the rest of the year in my classes, and the other because I'll be living with her.

I remember one night in highschool having an epiphany that I must be gay, and then the next morning I felt completely different, and it's been like that ever since. I know I'm not gay now, I'm pretty comfortable saying that my sexuality is bisexual and that I'm mostly attracted to girls, but occasionally to guys as well. However, I've been trying to ignore the issues I have with my gender (and you can probably guess how that turns out...).

The past year has been me living as I always have and ignoring it, and then it all came flooding back in the past couple of weeks. So, I've decided to start checking out the lgbt scene where I live and try to find a therapist to talk to about all of this.

I feel more feminine at times, and I want to explore that more, and I started by ordering some clothes and dressing up for the first time. It was nice, but when I looked at myself in the mirror I couldn't help but feel out of place. I have to wonder if this is more of a sexual thing (it does get me off a little bit..) and not really who I am.

Really, I feel like I don't want to have to separate sides of myself. I don't want to dress up in private and be a guy in public. I want to blend the two fluidly, because that's what I feel like. Wear makeup, maybe some androgynous clothing, keep it subtle, maybe push it sometimes... but whenever I have gone out wearing eye liner and blush (about a year ago now) I felt so awkward and out of place.

17,2013-08-05 15:56:53,1jqv3z,7,6,"Hey,

I am a 29 year old guy, married with 2 kids, and I'm pretty confused :(

Quick back story, used to try on my sisters and mothers clothes and underwear when I was a teenager, i've thought for a while that it was just a sex thing for me then, but thinking about it more I clearly remember wanting to always wear womens underwear, always wanted to go to sleep in them and wake up in the morning wearing them instead of boxers, but was terrified that my Mum or Dad would pop their head in at night to check on me and see, if the covers had fallen off or something. 

I joined the army when I was 19 and didnt really crossdress at all for years, fantasised about it, but never doing it, then when I was 26 I left the forces, met my wife and got married, had kids etc, I told my wife all about this, and she encouraged it, still does, saying that she loves me for who I am, not INSPITE of who I am, which is awesome , we've done so much in the past 4 or 5 years, and she's really made me slowly start to creap out of my shell, we go out shopping together for clothes, i've been out a few times fully dressed and made up, been to a MAC counter in guy mode and sat getting a foundation match in a packed dept store, started shaving my legs for a while and then actually started going out with shorts on + shaven legs, grown my hair long and started going to work in a ponytail, and this weekend, went and got ourselves some matching tattoo's, hers on her upper back and mine in a very sexy + feminine position on my hip, which I love!! This is all sounds great, and it would be, but its confusing the hell out of me, because I just don't feel like a guy, I get jealous of almost every attractive woman I see, its not the normal guy thoughts though, I want to BE them, not be IN them, is the easiest and bluntest (sorry) way I can put it :( I watch my wife getting dressed and I'm jealous of her curves and breasts and long thick hair that always looks good, she's said it before and I can't ever deny it, because its true, I want to be her. 

Not related to my gender confusedness, but kinda because it shows a lot about my personality, I've also always wanted to hook up with guys, talking to them on good ol' AOL chat when I was younger and arranging to meet up but then bottling it, I joined the army when I was 19 and spent much of my early 20's in the following cycle on nights out every weekend, go out with friends and get drunk, slink off to a nearby gay bar and hang around outside scared to go in in-case I knew anyone in there, go back home and immediately get on webcams for guys, arrange to meet up, bottle it incase anyone found out, rinse and repeat.

I've always been painfully shy, and pretty socially awkward at times, always terrified of other peoples opinions and what they would do or say about the things that I like/wore etc. I think i'm starting to shake this now, with a lot of help from my wife, I recently went for a day out to a farm with my little girl, wearing some skinny jeans, a long, blatantly womens, cardigan and my hair tied back and put in some plaits, something which I would NEVER have done as little as a year ago, i really feel like I'm finding myself, but I'm not sure who that person is. 

In a perfect world I'd have a smooth stubble free face, with a curvy shape and some boobs, which makes me sound trans, and for a while I thought I was (going on depression meds after imagining killing myself on the commute most mornings, and getting lost staring into a mirror thinking about stabbing my adams apple with some tweezers!), but I don't think I feel like a woman! :( and transition is also something I don't know if I could ever go through with, unless I was holding a gun to my head every night, but that won't happen as I am not desperately unhappy as a guy, and I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about coming out into the open with all that and being out there for friends and family to disown and the world to laugh and stare at as I pass in the street.

I kinda wish there was a button that I could press where I wake up as a woman tomorrow, with my relationship intact, and my work colleageus acting like I have always turned up to work in a skirt and heels :(

And thats my rant done, there's no conclusion, I'm not even sure if I'm asking anything in particular, I'd just really like some advice on this if possible.

This is all sounds great, and it would be, but its confusing the hell out of me, because I just don't feel like a guy, I get jealous of almost every attractive woman I see, its not the normal guy thoughts though, I want to BE them, not be IN them, is the easiest and bluntest (sorry) way I can put it :( I watch my wife getting dressed and I'm jealous of her curves and breasts and long thick hair that always looks good, she's said it before and I can't ever deny it, because its true, I want to be her. \n\nNot related to my gender confusedness, but kinda because it shows a lot about my personality, I've also always wanted to hook up with guys, talking to them on good ol' AOL chat when I was younger and arranging to meet up but then bottling it, I joined the army when I was 19 and spent much of my early 20's in the following cycle on nights out every weekend, go out with friends and get drunk, slink off to a nearby gay bar and hang around outside scared to go in in-case I knew anyone in there, go back home and immediately get on webcams for guys, arrange to meet up, bottle it incase anyone found out, rinse and repeat.\n\nI've always been painfully shy, and pretty socially awkward at times, always terrified of other peoples opinions and what they would do or say about the things that I like/wore etc. I think i'm starting to shake this now, with a lot of help from my wife, I recently went for a day out to a farm with my little girl, wearing some skinny jeans, a long, blatantly womens, cardigan and my hair tied back and put in some plaits, something which I would NEVER have done as little as a year ago, i really feel like I'm finding myself, but I'm not sure who that person is. \n\nIn a perfect world I'd have a smooth stubble free face, with a curvy shape and some boobs, which makes me sound trans, and for a while I thought I was (going on depression meds after imagining killing myself on the commute most mornings, and getting lost staring into a mirror thinking about stabbing my adams apple with some tweezers!), but I don't think I feel like a woman! :( and transition is also something I don't know if I could ever go through with, unless I was holding a gun to my head every night, but that won't happen as I am not desperately unhappy as a guy, and I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about coming out into the open with all that and being out there for friends and family to disown and the world to laugh and stare at as I pass in the street.\n\nI kinda wish there was a button that I could press where I wake up as a woman tomorrow, with my relationship intact, and my work colleageus acting like I have always turned up to work in a skirt and heels :(\n\nAnd thats my rant done, there's no conclusion, I'm not even sure if I'm asking anything in particular, I'd just really like some advice on this if possible.\n\nThanks\n\nGoing to xpost this in /r/asktransgender too as I'm not sure at all where I fall, incase you hadnt realised!\n\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Confused.... umm person??', 'created': 1375743413.0}",9.0

49,2013-08-11 03:33:26,1k4k0f,7,6,"So I may or may not be drunk, but I want to ramble and rant. It's been a shit week when it comes to gender issues and I don't know where to even start, I just want to ramble/talk.

There are times when I feel like I'm faking, do any of you feel the same way? Like I don't particularly want to have top surgery, most of the time. I often feel like I'm exaggerating my feelings and dysphoria, like maybe I""m not actually feeling it as strongly as I make myself believe I am, which just makes feeling it all the worse. It's like ""Oh, I really want to compress my tits and wear men's scents and have a packer"" but the next day I may be perfectly fine looking female (increasingly rare).

Some days (like recently), just looking at a naked male is enough to set off the ""I hate myself and my body"" feelings. Especially if it's a fit male. I'm nearly 100 lbs overweight and I lack the willpower to effectively lose weight consistently (I've lost 45lbs over the past year, though, which is something), so I feel like crap when I think about it.

I envy MTF or feminine GQ or trans individuals, because you seem so much better represented in the community. Every day I see something about an MFT or feminine individual on some subreddit or another, often multiple ones at the same exact time. And I envy you and I resent it, as bad as it makes me feel to resent it. I try to offer help on here to as many MTF/feminine people as possible, but it's draining when the masculine/FTM group is so underrepresented. I feel bad about it, but I can't help but feel bitter about it when I see these posts.

I also feel bitter against the FTM community, because it's all about passing as a stereotypical male, but I'm not a stereotypical male. I have long, curly, thick hair and I love it, I don't want to get rid of it. If I were thin, I'd like the freedom to sometimes wear bikinis or other incredibly feminine clothing, while still having the freedom to portray myself as incredibly masculine if I was feeling that way on that day. 

I don't fit into any category I've seen as of now and it's so draining I often don't know what to do. I write about it, my most recent character is a transguy who I haven't had the chance to fully explore, but right now even writing him is draining because he gets to do what I can't, though at the same time I want to be able to switch between a male and female body at will. It's just incredibly difficult to think straight when I can't come up with a concrete idea of what I want my physical body to look like, and I needed to rant and stuff about it. Maybe some of you have had similar experiences or feelings and can relate, that'd be nice.

Clothing is a strong form of self-expression. As a MAAB, I find it hard to express myself using the conventional male clothing.

Every male has a (mostly black/gray/brown/blue) T-shirt and denim pants on and that's all. There are a very few designs to choose from, a narrow variety of colors and I don't want to fit in. I would like to wear colorful things, t-shirts with vibrant-colored patterns, rainbow-striped long socks, or loosy sheer dress on a warm day. But wearing any of these things draws way too much attention from the surrounding (and I still have some social anxiety about that).

I don't want to dress as a woman. I want that these forms of cloting not to be considered female-only. I want the same freedom for men what every woman have. (And the same rights for the woman, that every man have. Feminism, ftw!)

It seems to me, that the role of the genders in our society is considered far too much important, that it really is. Males and females are seeing each other as they were different species. But the biological differences are pretty small. I dream of a genderless society.

I never felt being masculine the way the society showed me. I like my own male body, my only problem is my social gender. I simply hate the gender-binary.

Luckily, I moved to a different country previous year and started experimenting more with my gender. I wore skirts out in the public, I slowly, partly came out to even closer friends of mine. I enjoy the support of ~~my~~ an amazing girlfriend, who understands and supports me. I began to feel, what looks good (or at least: okay) on me.

I like to push the limits slowly; if I am wearing a skirt, then I avoid the bright colors to compensate the ""weirdness"" some way. The more important people I meet, the harder it gets to show myself.

Finally, I share some pictures with you, dear redditors. And no, I'm not creating a throwaway account. http://imgur.com/a/0Sqzd

Hey everyone,

I'm Dogenwolf, a guy who upon serious and lengthy consideration of the nature of genderqueers and genderfluid persons have finally arrived at the conclusion: This describes me and always has. I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to know that there is a word that describes my gender identities (plural).

I was born male but growing up always felt most comfortable alternating my dress between both genders and sometimes blending the two. I always felt a bit alienated even from my gay friends who were certain about their gender; even the guys who wear makeup when they go out to the club always identified as being very much male. I never knew what it meant to have a fixed perception of your own gender and now that I have a rudimentary understand of the term genderqueer, and a greater understanding of myself, I am *grateful* that I don't have a fixed gender identity.

I feel liberated, freed from my own expectations of gender conformity. I don't have to think of myself as a man or a woman because I am and can be all permutations of what those words mean to me, up to and including their total absence.

Two weeks ago I felt my identity shift towards the feminine and I followed the tide out. A week ago I felt a shift towards the masculine and I followed the tide back in. I no longer fight it, I move with it and it is *magic.* **I** am magic.

I also find that it's given me more security when it comes to my sexuality as well and I feel more inclined to investigate those parts of my sexuality that I felt were improper. I feel more secure with myself, so I feel no shame in them and, in fact, am proud and excited to be who I am, whoever that may be at any given time. It's fitting that I'm a Pisces (mutable water sign), too. The most notorious unstable sign, but I've found that in embracing my unstable identity I have found something incredibly stable and predictable. Yes, it shifts constantly like the moon, but now I *understand*.

----------

**The Growing Use of Mx as a Gender-inclusive Title in the UK** - Version 1.8 - 2013-08-16

Mx was created as a standard title without convey gender connotations, and can be used by anyone. It follows the M* pattern: Mr, Ms, Mx. It doesn't require a qualification or career as Dr and Rev do. The x represents a wildcard character that removes gender. The title is pronounced Mux or Mix.

Example: Mx Sam Smith.

The following pages provide evidence of well-known companies and organisations accepting and offering Mx as a gender-inclusive title at the time of writing. The earliest example of a major company accepting Mx in this document is by the Post Office in October 2009.

So I'm a 21-year-old gay man, and I'm generally pretty happy being a male. I like my male genitals, I like having sex with men, and I don't want to transition to being a woman. But lately, I've sort of been feeling like I wouldn't mind being a woman for a while. I've thought about cross dressing, but I haven't tried anything yet.

I'm fairly heavy set, and by some quirk of genetics, I've got pretty big man-boobs (which frankly I'm happy with, as I'm attracted to big people). I recently came across a blog by a guy who's been taking a low dose of estrogen in order to develop breasts, and it's pretty incredible. He's got a man's face and other parts but pretty nice, feminine breasts, and he doesn't plan on transitioning. I have to admit that I'm jealous. I feel like I want to be like that: sort of a combination of male and female. 

I certainly wouldn't take hormones without a doctor's supervision (honestly I'll probably never take them, period), but it's something I can't stop thinking about. I actually chatted a bit with the guy who runs the blog, but I can't find many other people who have done what he's doing (sort of a partial physical transition, but keeping his birth/assigned gender). I'm sure this sounds really weird, but I'm a bit confused about all this. Is this just a weird sexual kink? Am I really trans* and in denial? I don't know.

As someone who's identified as a gay man for many years, I haven't really begun to question my gender identity until just recently, and decided to turn here for a bit of guidance.

Currently, I'm just beginning to explore my own feelings on the matter. 

In a short and synoptic sentence, to be blunt, as a biological male, I have never really felt the same sort of affinity towards my genitals that others seem to feel. I have, quite frequently throughout my life, searched up about the likes of castration and vasectomies without any anxiety about the idea; infact, viewing the possibility in a positive manner.

When it comes to my genitals, I'm quite ambivalent - I have, even as a gay man, had occasional experiences of autogynephilia; however, although I feel I would feel more natural without my male genitals, I have yet to feel comfortable enough to take the chop to them.

Additionally, in spite of the occasional autogynephilia, I feel that I would still always identify as a man - and looking as a man, perhaps slightly more androgynous, is how I would like to remain.

I'm not trans, but I am bisexual, so I am part of (if only in a small way) part of the LGBT community, and I find that I have mixed emotions regarding everything regarding Chelsea's announcement.

On one side she deserves to live life as she feels most comfortable, but on the other side I feel like the announcement comes at a very delicate time and threatens to give ample ammunition to the transphobes in much of the news world. Rather than focusing on the whistleblowing on its moral/ethical basis, I'm worried that her actions will be overshadowed by her gender identity and that it'll all be dismissed as ""someone really confused and emotionally unstable"" rather than examining the two situations (the whistleblowing and the switch from man to woman). I almost feel like she should have waited a bit longer, let the media storm die down before making the announcement, rather than doing it now and running the risk of further marginalizing the trans community. 

What does everyone think? As someone looking in from the outside, its easy for me to have a more critical opinion because I lack the same empathy for the situation that you all share, and there is a much greater impact of an announcement regarding gender identity than sexual preference, so my effort at putting myself in your shoes is ineffective at best.

I. . .  I really dont know what to say.  I cant stop thinking about the possibility of living as a woman.  (I am currently male).  If I have free time to think, I wonder how family would react.  Friends.  What would change about life.  i fantasize about magical events that would leave me female.  Winning the lottery and using the money for procedures.  Becoming my dark souls character XD  Let me just put out my own list of I guess pros and cons.  

Pros.
I think I would be happier with myself.  
I think I would be more comfortable.
I would spend less time thinking about how much life will suck as a male.
I wouldn't have to sneak into my moms room to look at her clothes and wish I would look halfway nice in them, if I could ever wear them.  
I wouldnt find thinking of the future so absolutely depressing and frustrating.  
Generally probably being just happier and more content with myself

Cons
My parents are lds.  I have no idea how they would react.  Probably try to convince me I am wrong then argue then quote scripture and in the end my mom would be crying and everyone would be awkward if not straight up angry at me.  Except my brother.  He would be the chill one...
I have no monetary way to do any sort of hormone therapy or buy new clothes or do any kind of surgery.  That also means no money for a councillor (probably spelled wrong) or anything like that, hence dr. Reddit...
Social stigmas in getting jobs, houses, or just living.  
My friends. . .  I know a few of them would be put off to say the least.
The fact I would make an ugly woman with body hair and being overweight and all that crap.  (Though overweight is kinda improving I guess)
And lastly, I am attracted to girls, so throw being a lesbian on top of trans.


I dont know.  I dont understand what I think or feel or what.  All I know is that the weight of the whole thing is suffocating and I dont know if its just me being silly or if I actually feel this way.  Fuck this all sounds so cheesy.  I dont know what to do about feeling this way.  My mentality so far has been ignore it it will go away or I will move on.  
Well that changed for me when I picture my future and contemplate if my current future is worth anything.  Then I think about alternatives.  

If all this just sounds like normal teenage angst, just tell me so I can try to move on from it.  I dont know.  If its real, well I still dont know. 
If this isnt the right subreddit, sorry.  I generally lurk so this is new.  For a lot of reasons.

Edit: 
Just wanted to give you guys an update and thank you again for your help.  I feel I am transgender, and will hopefully be able to talk to a school councillor about it this year, as well as my brother and one of my friends.  
Again, thank you guys/girls so much for the help.  I was pretty sure that if I didnt tell anybody about my feelings I would suffocate.  ♡

I'm a POC (person of color) and FAAB. People would call me a 'tomboy' but I don't think they have any idea how deeply my feelings actually go.


I'm walking home with another POC in my department, we live in the same apartment complex. I invite him in, we're sitting at my kitchen table talking while my two other roommates are sitting in my living room watching Nip/Tuck and honestly, talking to us too.


The conversation was going fine, he's from NYC, I'm from Maryland, and we were mostly talking about our families, what we liked in television, movies, whatever. I honest to god don't even remember how it was brought up, but the topic of feminine gay men, was introduced by him. He even said, “I'm a little bit homophobic.” He explained to me how they made him feel uncomfortable and weird. He tried to defend his opinion, by saying “But you know, I have no problem with masculine gay men, just guys who paint their  nails and wear purses and shit.” And I'm sitting there kind of like, huh. Up until now I liked you. Let's see if I can change your mind.


So I try to dig deeper to understand why he doesn't like feminine gay men. I try to explain to him that gender expression and sexuality are two completely different things. As I was doing this, he'd try to challenge me with questions or statements, 


“Well what, are you into girls?”

“Well I have no problem with how you are,”

“You must be a feminist, aren't you.”

“Wait, what, you painted your ex-boyfriend's nails? Really?”


I replied, “So what if I'm into girls?” I'm not, I'm into men almost exclusively. Pretty sure I'm a 1 on the Kinsey scale, it takes a lot for me to be into women. And I had an ex who I would take with me to get pedicures. He loved them, and when we'd go (since I paid) I always had the caveat that since I was paying, I got to pick the color. I picked pink almost every single time. “So you have absolutely no problem with me as a masculine woman, or a tomboy, but you have a problem with men who are feminine?” After I presented all of my arguments and that last question, he was able to admit that it was a hypocritical opinion and he should probably work on it. That made me feel better, but I was still frustrated. Being biracial, I find it shameful if I run into another POC who doesn't support anyone else who's basically, non-conventional. Whether another race, religion, under the queer umbrella, what have you.


I politely walked him to the door at 10 so I could shower, but when I came back I was frustrated and complaining to my roommates, only to learn from one of them that she also doesn't like gays (men? Lesbians? I didn't ask and I quickly left to shower).


I really want to understand why gay men (and feminine gay men) bother the two of them, one because I'll see him for the rest of the year in my classes, and the other because I'll be living with her. The two girls I'm with seemed perfect. I was placed with them and I've been up here since Sunday, and they seem great so far. Like really, really great. They've had no problems with my tomboy personality or who I am as a person, or how I don't play by the rules.
