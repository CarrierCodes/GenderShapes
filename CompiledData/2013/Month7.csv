4,2013-07-03 11:11:05,1hk6xr,3,10,"So, here's my bit of background:  Grew up in a very conservative religious home.  Mom caught me wearing her clothes once or twice, had a few other run-ins getting caught with t-porn and crossdressing, etc...which eventually led to awful confusing and upsetting counselling sessions at my church.

Tally up about a decade of self-hatred, confusion, insecurity, compulsive eating, self-destructive behavior, binges, purges (crossdressing, not bulimia, though I dabbled in that on occasion too), and so on...

Almost 30, I meet the love of my life...she's LGBT-friendly, and I know this, but she doesn't know my secret. She continually expresses open-mindedness in the bedroom, but it takes me 3 years broach the subject.  

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

History lesson over...incoming novella:

Over a few days, she cycles through a few of the stages of grief before my eyes, denying I'm ""really"" bi, declaring I must be gay (not in a hurtful way), until she eventually realizes I'm still madly in love with her, I only have romantic interest in women (namely, *her*), but I am sometimes sexually attracted to men.  She's fine with this.  Hell, it's even a bit of a turn-on for her, and we enjoy the role reversal in the bedroom.  

We kinda just keep it there in the bedroom for the next couple years...our little kink.  My crazy little fetish she indulges. I think this is more my doing than hers...my reluctance to give up what little ground I've gained.  I don't want to push her past her comfort level and lose even the sexy time roleplay.

Recently, we both started down the path of losing weight and getting healthy.  We both have significant amounts of weight to lose, and my size is something that's kept me from dressing up in recent years. I just don't feel attractive.  


Lately we've been watching makeup vids (or rather she has, and I've been watching over her shoulder, commenting, making remarks about liking this, or wanting that).  I commented offhand that I wanted to celebrate reaching our weight loss goals (still probably a year or more away) by taking a trip, spending the day getting pampered, dressing up, and having a girl's weekend out together.  Go shopping, go to a club, flirt, the whole deal...then return to the hotel (maybe with a new boy toy in tow) to have some fun.  

She liked the idea quite a bit.  So I probed and prodded and asked questions...and she was unfazed.  She thought it sounded like perfect fun.  I kept making more and more comments, and thinking out loud, and she's happily nodding and agreeing with all of it.  

The next day, I came home to something completely unexpected.  She hands me a bottle of nail polish.  ""You like?  I picked the color for you.""

""You mean...you picked the color thought I'd like to see *you* wear...or you picked out the polish for *me* to wear??""

""For you to wear...I thought it would look good on you.""

....

I almost cried...my heart welled up.  That small gesture, indicating so much acceptance of who I was and who I *want* to be...it meant so much more than she could have imagined.  And it set loose a torrent of thoughts and ideas and questions.  I kept asking her questions...exploring...leading up to stuff like, would she care if I grew out my hair?  Would she go shopping with me?  Would she be upset if I shaved my body?  When we buy a house, can I have my own clothes and makeup? She was completely fine with ALL of it.  

Even though I know she likes manly hairy guys, she would be completely ok with me taking whatever steps I wanted to be passable when I dress up.  She loves me just as I am, and would even still be attracted to me en femme.  Because of my relationship/baggage with my family, and the drama it'd create for my young son, I told her don't see myself transitioning...I am just so grateful to be able to express this side of myself openly and without shame to the person I love most in the world.  

While it may be a strain down the road (I'll deal with it then), having a ""alter ego"" right now kind of appeals to me.  I want to see how ""Jules"" handles things differently than ""Jeff""...I want to ""meet"" that side of me, and I think my wife is just as excited.

Still amazed at her comfort level with this whole thing, I asked her what her limits would be, and she said she wouldn't be comfortable with me having surgery, which is fine, since I couldn't hide that from my family anyway....as nice as having my own breasts would be, even I'm not ready to think about something that permanent.  I'm still very new to approaching this without shame and fear and self-loathing.

My only regret is not telling her sooner...both for her own sake, and because things might have taken a different path...maybe if before my son had been born, I'd have considered telling my family and living as a woman for awhile...but between the family drama and the potential fallout for my baby boy, sharing this with my wife is enough for now.

I hope someone here finds this encouraging.  The world can be an awful, harsh place, but there *are* people out there who will love you exactly as you are.  Don't settle for less.

They all seemed surprisingly OK with it, despite the fact that they're a Christian, farming family that lives in Texas... My mom told me that she would love me no matter what my gender/sexuality was, and my younger sibling even said that he had thought of the possibility of being trans himself. At the same time, I came out as pansexual, and that seemed to come as no surprise to them. At the very least, they already knew I wasn't straight. 

However, ever since I came out, communication between us has been waning. It went from almost daily communication, to the current situation of not having communicated with them in over a week.

The long version is long and I'm confused. English is not my main language, so I'm sorry for any mistakes. If something is not clear, just let me know and I'll fix it.

OK, so I'm a guy. I'm 28, Brazilian, and I'm married to a wonderful girl that I love. I have wanted to be a girl as far as I can remember, but I grew up in a traditional family and I learned it was wrong. To make me even more confuse, I am sexually attracted to women, not men.

So I grew up always telling myself to forget this bullshit of wanting to be a woman. Deep down I always wished to be Mistique (from the X-men comics), a mutant that can change her own body at will.

**When I was a teen I used to imagine myself being a woman**, with a nice body and wearing nice dresses. When I was masturbating I used to imagine me as a woman in sexy situations. But I just kept telling myself it was me thinking weird stuff because I had no girlfriend.

I started dating very late. I was 18 when I had my first kiss. I dated one girl for one year, then we broke up. Half a year later (it was 2005) I met this wonderful girl and we started dating. Many years later, in September 2012, we got married.

I am very lucky because this girl is a psychologist. During these years we are together she has helped me undo a lot of mental programming that society did to me. She helped me get rid of prejudices, fears, and a lot of stuff. We grew a lot together.

But after all this time I still imagine me as a woman to help me get aroused. I look at picturesof women wearing sexy dresses and imagine the woman is me, being sexy to my wife. I see lesbian movies and I imagine I am one of them and my wife is the other. When I have sex with my wife I imagine we're both women.

This week, for the first time in my life, I accepted that I want to be a woman. I stopped fighting against my own desires. So... **today I told my wife I want to be a woman**. She was a bit shocked, but not much. I've always been a feminine guy. Not too much feminine, I'm not mistaken for gay or anything, but not a masculine guy in behavior.

The best thing is that she will support me. She will stand by me if this is what I want for my future. **But I am afraid**.

So, after this long text, these are my main worries. In the next paragraphs I will list everything that worries me. I need your help and experience.

**1) Sex life**

I love sex and so does my wife. Can I have a regular sex life if I become a full woman? Will I still be able to have orgasms? Can I have orgasms with penetration? And masturbating by myself? Will the hormones lower my desire for sex? And can we really have full sex pleasure if she's not a lesbian?

Edit to clarify: I love sex and sexual plays, but I am (obviously?) not very satisfied with my body during sex. But even with this problem I still love sex and I think about sex almost every day.

**2) The surgery**

I am afraid of the surgery. I am a guy that almost pass out when I have to take a vaccine. When I tried to donate blood I passed out even before the needle was inside me.

Does it hurt too much? Are there significant risks of death?

And my main fear: I live in Brazil, not a first world country. What are the risks of me becoming a genderless abomination instead of a woman?

**3) I am too man-like in appearance**

I'm not too masculine in behavior, but I am very masculine in appearance. I have a lot of hair everywhere. A LOT. My wife said I am the hairiest man she has ever seen. I even have a lot of hair in places many other men don't have too much, like my feet. My toe has a lot of hair!

And hair is not the only problem. I have a very masculine facial structure, with a very masculine nose and a very masculine brow. With a masculine mouth.

**I want to be a pretty woman**, I don't want to look like the tranny we see here near interstate roads in Brazil that look like an ugly caricature of a woman.

I want to be a pretty woman because I want my wife to still be sexually attracted to me. I want her to desire my body. I don't mean I want to be a model. I just want to look like an average woman.

This number 3 is my main worry. Is it possible to become an attractive woman if I am a manly man? Do I have to go to other countries and do surgeries that will break the bones in my face to try and make me a prettier woman?

**EDIT**

**4) Is it too late?**

OK, I forgot to add this one. I see many people starting their treatment during teen years, or early twenties. I'm almost 29 and I'm afraid I am too old to start it now. I am afraid that I will only have **some** feminine features, but I will never look like a woman like people that started treatment when 16 years old.

I want a more gender neutral name or at least a female name that doesn't sound so frilly (hard ending instead of soft vowel ending probably). I figured this sub would give me the best input with people understanding why I want a name that I feel I identify with. I'd also love to be more androgynous and I'm more actively working on that now in my life.

The problem I've had in the past is with friends tending to not like my new name ideas because ""I don't look like an X - you look like your name!""  ugh. So I want to avoid that and get some input on what random people on the internet think I look like.

So I ask you - what should my new first name be? 

I've thought of a few I like: Kim, Jamie, Nico, Aislin (probably go by Ash usually).

I'm not fully set on any of them so any input and suggestions are welcomed - I want a name I like, and one that most people will believe is my name because I look like it. Thanks everyone!

I figured this sub would give me the best input with people understanding why I want a name that I feel I identify with. I\'d also love to be more androgynous and I\'m more actively working on that now in my life.\n\nThe problem I\'ve had in the past is with friends tending to not like my new name ideas because ""I don\'t look like an X - you look like your name!""  ugh. So I want to avoid that and get some input on what random people on the internet think I look like.\n\nSo I ask you - what should my new first name be? \n\nI\'ve thought of a few I like: Kim, Jamie, Nico, Aislin (probably go by Ash usually).\n\nI\'m not fully set on any of them so any input and suggestions are welcomed - I want a name I like, and one that most people will believe is my name because I look like it.

A therapist would probably be useful right about now, but I can't afford one, and I've had horrible luck with my local therapists so I'd have to go find one that does phone/skype sessions. So I'm hoping someone here can commiserate or offer some guidance. :)


First off, I'm pretty sure that I'm transgender, to an extent. I'm FAAB, spent my life wishing I would wake up as a boy, and when I was younger I was convinced that I must've been born intersex and the doctors just decided I should be female and my parents were hiding it from me. Both of these seem like pretty standard narratives around these parts.


All that being said, now, as an adult I don't have a huge urge to transition socially, I'm fine looking female-ish and I don't care that I am a complete tomboy. But my body...it hates me. My hormones are completely out of whack. I get hormone-induced migraines, horrible mood swings, lots of pain, and my adhd is not happy for about half the month.


So I want constant hormone levels more than anything. I don't want any more of this cyclical nonsense. Birth control would be a great idea but apparently constant doses of female hormones make me suicidal. After years of frustration with multiple doctors I'm thinking that testosterone is the best option and I'd like to at least try it (I do realize that it's possible that my body is just fail and can't handle anything, but it's the only thing I haven't tried yet). 


The problem is that, as I mentioned earlier, I don't want to really transition. I can deal with shaving/waxing hair, but what about voice changes? Does the voice training that MTF people do work for trans-masculine people too? Should I just learn to embrace my non-binary gender identity and have a lower voice while presenting female? I know I've seen people on youtube who identify as genderqueer and say they still have female-presenting days on T, but I haven't seen anyone who shows it on camera.


I'm planning on getting top surgery also, which wouldn't help if I want to keep presenting socially as female. I should also mention that I would kill for the other effects of testosterone (more masculine fat redistribution, ability to build some muscle, etc.)

I get hormone-induced migraines, horrible mood swings, lots of pain, and my adhd is not happy for about half the month.\n\n\nSo I want constant hormone levels more than anything. I don't want any more of this cyclical nonsense. Birth control would be a great idea but apparently constant doses of female hormones make me suicidal. After years of frustration with multiple doctors I'm thinking that testosterone is the best option and I'd like to at least try it (I do realize that it's possible that my body is just fail and can't handle anything, but it's the only thing I haven't tried yet). \n\n\nThe problem is that, as I mentioned earlier, I don't want to really transition. I can deal with shaving/waxing hair, but what about voice changes? Does the voice training that MTF people do work for trans-masculine people too? Should I just learn to embrace my non-binary gender identity and have a lower voice while presenting female? I know I've seen people on youtube who identify as genderqueer and say they still have female-presenting days on T, but I haven't seen anyone who shows it on camera.\n\n\nI'm planning on getting top surgery also, which wouldn't help if I want to keep presenting socially as female. I should also mention that I would kill for the other effects of testosterone (more masculine fat redistribution, ability to build some muscle, etc.)\n\n\nAaah. Anyone feel the same?

Am I just being unrealistic here?"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'How realistic is it to take hormones but not socially transition?', 'created': 1373693837.0}",

I've found myself questioning my gender identity.  I know for sure that I am not cisgender.  After that, I'm less sure.  I definitely lean more towards ""woman,"" but I'm not sure that even that feels quite right.

Since coming out I've had a number of moments in which I thought I was absolutely sure that I was a transwoman.  I've had some moments when I thought I might be bi/tri/3rd gender or gender fluid.  I'm still pretty confused on the matter.

At this very moment, I don't *feel* like a woman as much as I do at other times.  Then again, I've been really depressed.  I've very much felt like I'm putting myself back in the closet, internally.  I've had thoughts like ""you just have to play with equipment you're given"" and I'm questioning whether the whole thing was just some kind of dream.

One reason that I didn't come to the conclusion that I'm trans* earlier was because I looked at my friend J (ftm; hormones + top surgery only) who was so clear about his gender identity and thought, ""I'm not like that, I must not be trans.""  8 years later, I know that there's a lot more to trans* than simply wanting to be on the opposite end of the binary.

Whenever I'm out and I see women, all I think is ""I wish I could look like that"" or ""I wish I could be like that.""  And yet, I know that I probably never will.  By the same token, I don't hate my body.  I mean, it's a nice enough body.  It just feels foreign.  And yet not foreign at the same time.  Familiar perhaps?

Not that it's actually based in science, but sometimes oI get the sense that I have too much testosterone.  I'm always too hot, I hate my sex drive.  I'll be trying to make friends with a woman and this voice in my head interjects and says ""fuck her; get laid;"" and it feels like more than just the typical struggle between lust and affection.  Like those thoughts aren't mine, like they don't belong.

64,2013-07-22 04:33:53,1isjxv,1,5,"I'm not completely sure what I hope to achieve by writing this post, but I've been thinking about this all so much lately that I thought that trying to put it into words, and hearing some outside perspectives, might help me figure it out a little more... Sorry, this might be a little long but I really appreciate your attention.

I am a 24 year old person. I have a female body, and identify as bisexual, though the only person I have actually done anything with is male, and I tend to be more attracted to men. 

Ever since I can remember, I have wished that I was a boy. This is TMI I am sure, but I remember sitting on the toilet when I was very young (elementary school age) and imagining that the hanging turds were my penis haha. Sorry. I kept my hair very short and loved when people mistook me for a boy, and I prided myself on being a tom boy and not being into girly things (dolls, pink, etc.). I had a pretty crappy childhood (my parents divorced when I was around 6, my mother is a verbally abusive alchoholic and my father is incredibly distant and probably somewhere on the autism scale) so I ended up extremely overweight, extremely depressed, and often suicidal. I also cut myself for a period of time.

When I was in 6th grade, I met my best friend, who I will call Trevor. Trevor already at that age (12) identified as gay. Naturally I promptly fell in love with him and spent many angsty teenage years desperately wishing that I was a guy so that we could be together.

When I went to highschool, because of Trevor's sexuality and my own, I decided to join the GSA. There, I met a guy who identified as FTM, and realized that that might be what I was too. I told my friends and the other GSA members that I was trans and was largely supported by them, although I felt too embarrassed by my body to actually try to pass as a guy or ask anyone to use a different name or pronouns for me. By that time I had long hair, was probably close to 300lbs, and wore only huge baggy black clothing and a black trenchcoat year round (all to hide myself.) Eventually I became so miserable due to my home life and bullying at school that I dropped out.

I moved out of state and basically stayed in my room doing nothing but pretending to be a guy on the internet for about a year. During this time I didn't see Trevor much at all, just talked to him on the phone. Finally, though, he came to visit me and in the course of a long conversation we ended up hooking up. That first time I didn't let him do anything to me other than kiss me, but the fact that he actually liked me that way and wanted me to touch him completely blew my world view wide open. I wasn't just disgusting and terrible; this person who I loved so strongly, who I thought could never love me back did! Knowing that changed everything for me -- I started eating healthy and losing weight, I went back to finish high school and subsequently started college, and things kept progressing between Trevor and me until we were officially a couple. I became much more comfortable with my body and, also, with being a girl -- I embraced being his girlfriend, because it was the first female role which actually felt right and natural for me. Since I had never been disgusted by my actual genitals as I thought trans people generally were (I always masturbated, while my FTM friend said he could never bring himself to, and I enjoyed having sex with Trevor as a woman) and I now felt so much better about myself, I figured that I wasn't trans at all... and that it had been more about the weight, and feeling like that disqualified me from really being a girl.

Trevor and I have been together for about six years now. He identifies as bisexual, though he is still much more attracted to men than women and doesn't really know whether he would want to be with any female person other than me. We have great sex together, and are compatible in many other ways, as well as loving each other deeply and being very comitted to each other.

However, in the last year or so we have started (mostly at my suggestion) roleplaying during sex occasionally that we are both men. I find this incredibly arousing. I feel so uninhibited pretending to be a guy; like I can really do and say what I want, and like everything is so much more powerful and intense. It is incredible and has awakened the desire in me again to be something different than what I am, and what the world sees me as...

I don't think that I could ever pass as a man. I am very feminine looking. The idea, also, of any sort of surgery terrifies me and I really don't think I could go through with it. So even if I come to the conclusion that I'm not really a woman, I don't know if it would mean anything. But I am really struggling with it right now. I am grieving for the life which I want, the things I want to do, which seem impossible the way I am now. And although I am very happy in my relationship with Trevor as it is, I feel like, if I had the chance, I might have been able to love him in a different way... a way which might have been better for him, given his sexuality... I am grieving for that missed chance too. He says that part of the reason he felt like he could be with me when it started was that he knew I identified as a guy, but he loves me for me, as a women or a man or anything in between, that it doesn't matter to him. I believe him. But I can't shake the feeling that it could be better... for me at least? If I could feel more like myself, less trapped in my body and more at home in it... I'm not sure I feel like a man, but I don't feel strongly like a woman either.

Like I said, I don't know what I'm really trying to say here... I am just so confused and so sad.

Tl;dr: I am female, in a romantic/sexual relationship with a man who is almost 100% homosexual. I wanted to be a boy when I was younger, identified as trans, then changed my mind when I started the relationship. Now have been roleplaying as a man during sex and it has been so great that I am getting confused again. Hate being perceived as a woman.

I'm a long time lurker and don't post very often to ANY subreddit, so this is very new and a little frightening to me. 

I'm a biological female and recently realized that I'm genderfluid. I've only told my good friends and my boyfriend, and everyone is quite accepting of it. I bought a tri-top binder a few weeks ago and when I wear I feel like the ocean has been drained out of my lungs and I'm finally the way I was always supposed to be. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy being female-bodied. I like to look very feminine sometimes, but most of the time I feel trapped. And my binder has quickly become something I'm not comfortable going without. But a few days ago I began to really worry about what binding (a little over half of the time) would do to my breasts. I really don't want them to be damaged or extremely saggy (shit, i hate that word). My boyfriend has also expressed this concern and I really don't want to become unattractive in his eyes.  

I've read that in order to keep this from happening you can't bind more than a few times every two weeks. And this is devastating to me. I really need some help and advice and I so appreciate anyone who takes the time to hear me out and offer their experiences or opinions.

I am comfortable with society as a whole seeing me as a man. However, internally, I don't really see myself as a man *as opposed to a woman*. I feel that gender is a construct, and there are times when I feel more like a woman than a man, and that *most of the time* I don't feel like a **man** or a **woman** - I'm somewhere in between, or outside... or... something. I think genderqueer is a nice term for it. Maybe I'm a genderqueer man or something. But like I said, I don't mind the rest of the world not hearing the 'genderqueer' qualifier and just seeing me as a man when I'm out and about interacting with them (and I can be a pretty lady on my own, inside with some ice cream and a mirror :) ).

The one person who's an exception... is my girlfriend. She knows that I crossdress. She's fine with it, although she doesn't get involved herself. The thing is, when we first got together, she asked me to describe my sexuality to her in as much detail as possible, so she could really understand where I am on that spectrum. (To be honest, since I don't really believe in gender as a fixed thing, you probably won't be surprised to hear that I don't really have a fixed sexuality :p but the closest is bisexual). My girlfriend is asexual, so we are both in not-so-straightforward sexuality categories. She was really good about getting to understand my perspective on that, and early in the relationship we talked about sexuality a lot. (We don't talk about it much any more since we are comfortable with each other after being together for over a year now).

But she never has asked me 'please tell me about your gender in as much detail as possible'. So although she *knows* about my 'woman' side, she has never really acknowledged it. Every now and then I will say something about myself in a feminine context, and she often replies with ""but you're a man!"". Recently we were discussing something to do with 'geek girls' and I said something about myself, and she laughed and said ""you're not a girl!"". In this situations I usually shrug it off and say ""hah, well..."" and trail off without saying anything.

To be honest, it is not a big deal. If she sees me as a man, well, that doesn't change who I am. She has never been mean about it. I don't feel that it impedes my quality of life much or at all. It's just that at those moments, I guess the girl inside of me feels like she's being silenced, and the man (who gets most of the control of my mouth!) never stands up for her.

I don't know what to do. Is it worth bringing this up with her? Has anyone had to have a conversation like that? How did it go? What would be a good way to bring it up? I don't want to make her feel bad or overstate the situation... but I don't want to trivialise and ignore my identity around the most important person in my life, either.

Another complication is that my girlfriend is very interested in feminist issues. I consider myself a feminist as well, and have read up on feminism, but I am careful not to inject my male voice and speak for women or anything like that. I'm a white man, who is not straight but has a girlfriend, so is not obviously LGBT+ to the outside world. My girlfriend is not white, nor a man. I don't want to come across as sort of 'bandwagoning' myself into being a minority, or like I'm pretending the issues that minorities can suffer from are a big problem for me as well. This is especially relevant in that geek girl conversation - I'm sure every redditor knows that geeks who come across as women can have a pretty hard time sometimes. I'm in no danger of being seen as a woman by most people, so I don't have those problems. But I do consider myself *in some ways* a girl, and certainly a geek. So I don't want to be included in the group of 'people who suffer as a result of being both a geek and a girl', but I would like someone close to me to appreciate that actually I am both a geek and a girl, however atypical my experience of that is.

I guess if I could get the muscles and more 'strong' frame but keep my lady bits, I would jump on that. But I don't want facial hair or a lower voice. 

I don't know I've considered doing a FtM but whenever I think about it a part of me knows I'm not entirely happy with either gender, so that's out of the question. I feel more like I rest somewhere in the middle.

16,2013-07-03 11:11:05,1hk6xr,3,10,"So, here's my bit of background:  Grew up in a very conservative religious home.  Mom caught me wearing her clothes once or twice, had a few other run-ins getting caught with t-porn and crossdressing, etc...which eventually led to awful confusing and upsetting counselling sessions at my church.

Tally up about a decade of self-hatred, confusion, insecurity, compulsive eating, self-destructive behavior, binges, purges (crossdressing, not bulimia, though I dabbled in that on occasion too), and so on...

Almost 30, I meet the love of my life...she's LGBT-friendly, and I know this, but she doesn't know my secret. She continually expresses open-mindedness in the bedroom, but it takes me 3 years broach the subject.  

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

History lesson over...incoming novella:

Over a few days, she cycles through a few of the stages of grief before my eyes, denying I'm ""really"" bi, declaring I must be gay (not in a hurtful way), until she eventually realizes I'm still madly in love with her, I only have romantic interest in women (namely, *her*), but I am sometimes sexually attracted to men.  She's fine with this.  Hell, it's even a bit of a turn-on for her, and we enjoy the role reversal in the bedroom.  

We kinda just keep it there in the bedroom for the next couple years...our little kink.  My crazy little fetish she indulges. I think this is more my doing than hers...my reluctance to give up what little ground I've gained.  I don't want to push her past her comfort level and lose even the sexy time roleplay.

Recently, we both started down the path of losing weight and getting healthy.  We both have significant amounts of weight to lose, and my size is something that's kept me from dressing up in recent years. I just don't feel attractive.  


Lately we've been watching makeup vids (or rather she has, and I've been watching over her shoulder, commenting, making remarks about liking this, or wanting that).  I commented offhand that I wanted to celebrate reaching our weight loss goals (still probably a year or more away) by taking a trip, spending the day getting pampered, dressing up, and having a girl's weekend out together.  Go shopping, go to a club, flirt, the whole deal...then return to the hotel (maybe with a new boy toy in tow) to have some fun.  

She liked the idea quite a bit.  So I probed and prodded and asked questions...and she was unfazed.  She thought it sounded like perfect fun.  I kept making more and more comments, and thinking out loud, and she's happily nodding and agreeing with all of it.  

The next day, I came home to something completely unexpected.  She hands me a bottle of nail polish.  ""You like?  I picked the color for you.""

""You mean...you picked the color thought I'd like to see *you* wear...or you picked out the polish for *me* to wear??""

""For you to wear...I thought it would look good on you.""

....

I almost cried...my heart welled up.  That small gesture, indicating so much acceptance of who I was and who I *want* to be...it meant so much more than she could have imagined.  And it set loose a torrent of thoughts and ideas and questions.  I kept asking her questions...exploring...leading up to stuff like, would she care if I grew out my hair?  Would she go shopping with me?  Would she be upset if I shaved my body?  When we buy a house, can I have my own clothes and makeup? She was completely fine with ALL of it.  

Even though I know she likes manly hairy guys, she would be completely ok with me taking whatever steps I wanted to be passable when I dress up.  She loves me just as I am, and would even still be attracted to me en femme.  Because of my relationship/baggage with my family, and the drama it'd create for my young son, I told her don't see myself transitioning...I am just so grateful to be able to express this side of myself openly and without shame to the person I love most in the world.  

While it may be a strain down the road (I'll deal with it then), having a ""alter ego"" right now kind of appeals to me.  I want to see how ""Jules"" handles things differently than ""Jeff""...I want to ""meet"" that side of me, and I think my wife is just as excited.

Still amazed at her comfort level with this whole thing, I asked her what her limits would be, and she said she wouldn't be comfortable with me having surgery, which is fine, since I couldn't hide that from my family anyway....as nice as having my own breasts would be, even I'm not ready to think about something that permanent.  I'm still very new to approaching this without shame and fear and self-loathing.

My only regret is not telling her sooner...both for her own sake, and because things might have taken a different path...maybe if before my son had been born, I'd have considered telling my family and living as a woman for awhile...but between the family drama and the potential fallout for my baby boy, sharing this with my wife is enough for now.

So I ask you - what should my new first name be? 

I've thought of a few I like: Kim, Jamie, Nico, Aislin (probably go by Ash usually).

I'm not fully set on any of them so any input and suggestions are welcomed - I want a name I like, and one that most people will believe is my name because I look like it. Thanks everyone!

- One side: Want to see what changes would happen to my body and how much more feminine I'd look with a thinner waist, budding breasts, fat redistribution around my face, ass, and waist.

- Other side: still happy as a male, dont want to lose my sex drive or ability to get an erection and have kids eventually. Live every day as a guy, no problems whatsoever seeing myself as one

I do hate all of my body hair, would love to get rid of it all with laser, permanently. That I am fully sure of. Would like to be more androgynous to pass more easily, but the lingering feeling of wanting to be a girl keeps eating away at me.

A therapist would probably be useful right about now, but I can't afford one, and I've had horrible luck with my local therapists so I'd have to go find one that does phone/skype sessions. So I'm hoping someone here can commiserate or offer some guidance. :)


First off, I'm pretty sure that I'm transgender, to an extent. I'm FAAB, spent my life wishing I would wake up as a boy, and when I was younger I was convinced that I must've been born intersex and the doctors just decided I should be female and my parents were hiding it from me. Both of these seem like pretty standard narratives around these parts.


All that being said, now, as an adult I don't have a huge urge to transition socially, I'm fine looking female-ish and I don't care that I am a complete tomboy. But my body...it hates me. My hormones are completely out of whack. I get hormone-induced migraines, horrible mood swings, lots of pain, and my adhd is not happy for about half the month.


So I want constant hormone levels more than anything. I don't want any more of this cyclical nonsense. Birth control would be a great idea but apparently constant doses of female hormones make me suicidal. After years of frustration with multiple doctors I'm thinking that testosterone is the best option and I'd like to at least try it (I do realize that it's possible that my body is just fail and can't handle anything, but it's the only thing I haven't tried yet). 


The problem is that, as I mentioned earlier, I don't want to really transition. I can deal with shaving/waxing hair, but what about voice changes? Does the voice training that MTF people do work for trans-masculine people too? Should I just learn to embrace my non-binary gender identity and have a lower voice while presenting female? I know I've seen people on youtube who identify as genderqueer and say they still have female-presenting days on T, but I haven't seen anyone who shows it on camera.


I'm planning on getting top surgery also, which wouldn't help if I want to keep presenting socially as female. I should also mention that I would kill for the other effects of testosterone (more masculine fat redistribution, ability to build some muscle, etc.)

I've found myself questioning my gender identity.  I know for sure that I am not cisgender.  After that, I'm less sure.  I definitely lean more towards ""woman,"" but I'm not sure that even that feels quite right.

Since coming out I've had a number of moments in which I thought I was absolutely sure that I was a transwoman.  I've had some moments when I thought I might be bi/tri/3rd gender or gender fluid.  I'm still pretty confused on the matter.

At this very moment, I don't *feel* like a woman as much as I do at other times.  Then again, I've been really depressed.  I've very much felt like I'm putting myself back in the closet, internally.  I've had thoughts like ""you just have to play with equipment you're given"" and I'm questioning whether the whole thing was just some kind of dream.

One reason that I didn't come to the conclusion that I'm trans* earlier was because I looked at my friend J (ftm; hormones + top surgery only) who was so clear about his gender identity and thought, ""I'm not like that, I must not be trans.""  8 years later, I know that there's a lot more to trans* than simply wanting to be on the opposite end of the binary.

Whenever I'm out and I see women, all I think is ""I wish I could look like that"" or ""I wish I could be like that.""  And yet, I know that I probably never will.  By the same token, I don't hate my body.  I mean, it's a nice enough body.  It just feels foreign.  And yet not foreign at the same time.  Familiar perhaps?

Not that it's actually based in science, but sometimes oI get the sense that I have too much testosterone.  I'm always too hot, I hate my sex drive.  I'll be trying to make friends with a woman and this voice in my head interjects and says ""fuck her; get laid;"" and it feels like more than just the typical struggle between lust and affection.  Like those thoughts aren't mine, like they don't belong.

**tl;dr** I often feel like I want to be a woman.  Right now I'm depressed and also questioning my gender identity.


I know that I don't have make any decisions about my identity immediately, but I'm struggling and trying to find some clarity.

* those of you have/are planning to transition, have you ever had moments where you kinda lost the feeling?

* other genderqueer folk, have you found some kind of happy medium that enables you to feel comfortable without HRT or surgery?

Sorry, this might be a little long but I really appreciate your attention.

I am a 24 year old person. I have a female body, and identify as bisexual, though the only person I have actually done anything with is male, and I tend to be more attracted to men. 

Ever since I can remember, I have wished that I was a boy. This is TMI I am sure, but I remember sitting on the toilet when I was very young (elementary school age) and imagining that the hanging turds were my penis haha. Sorry. I kept my hair very short and loved when people mistook me for a boy, and I prided myself on being a tom boy and not being into girly things (dolls, pink, etc.). I had a pretty crappy childhood (my parents divorced when I was around 6, my mother is a verbally abusive alchoholic and my father is incredibly distant and probably somewhere on the autism scale) so I ended up extremely overweight, extremely depressed, and often suicidal. I also cut myself for a period of time.

When I was in 6th grade, I met my best friend, who I will call Trevor. Trevor already at that age (12) identified as gay. Naturally I promptly fell in love with him and spent many angsty teenage years desperately wishing that I was a guy so that we could be together.

When I went to highschool, because of Trevor's sexuality and my own, I decided to join the GSA. There, I met a guy who identified as FTM, and realized that that might be what I was too. I told my friends and the other GSA members that I was trans and was largely supported by them, although I felt too embarrassed by my body to actually try to pass as a guy or ask anyone to use a different name or pronouns for me. By that time I had long hair, was probably close to 300lbs, and wore only huge baggy black clothing and a black trenchcoat year round (all to hide myself.) Eventually I became so miserable due to my home life and bullying at school that I dropped out.

I moved out of state and basically stayed in my room doing nothing but pretending to be a guy on the internet for about a year. During this time I didn't see Trevor much at all, just talked to him on the phone. Finally, though, he came to visit me and in the course of a long conversation we ended up hooking up. That first time I didn't let him do anything to me other than kiss me, but the fact that he actually liked me that way and wanted me to touch him completely blew my world view wide open. I wasn't just disgusting and terrible; this person who I loved so strongly, who I thought could never love me back did! Knowing that changed everything for me -- I started eating healthy and losing weight, I went back to finish high school and subsequently started college, and things kept progressing between Trevor and me until we were officially a couple. I became much more comfortable with my body and, also, with being a girl -- I embraced being his girlfriend, because it was the first female role which actually felt right and natural for me. Since I had never been disgusted by my actual genitals as I thought trans people generally were (I always masturbated, while my FTM friend said he could never bring himself to, and I enjoyed having sex with Trevor as a woman) and I now felt so much better about myself, I figured that I wasn't trans at all... and that it had been more about the weight, and feeling like that disqualified me from really being a girl.

Trevor and I have been together for about six years now. He identifies as bisexual, though he is still much more attracted to men than women and doesn't really know whether he would want to be with any female person other than me. We have great sex together, and are compatible in many other ways, as well as loving each other deeply and being very comitted to each other.

However, in the last year or so we have started (mostly at my suggestion) roleplaying during sex occasionally that we are both men. I find this incredibly arousing. I feel so uninhibited pretending to be a guy; like I can really do and say what I want, and like everything is so much more powerful and intense. It is incredible and has awakened the desire in me again to be something different than what I am, and what the world sees me as...

I don't think that I could ever pass as a man. I am very feminine looking. The idea, also, of any sort of surgery terrifies me and I really don't think I could go through with it. So even if I come to the conclusion that I'm not really a woman, I don't know if it would mean anything. But I am really struggling with it right now. I am grieving for the life which I want, the things I want to do, which seem impossible the way I am now. And although I am very happy in my relationship with Trevor as it is, I feel like, if I had the chance, I might have been able to love him in a different way... a way which might have been better for him, given his sexuality... I am grieving for that missed chance too. He says that part of the reason he felt like he could be with me when it started was that he knew I identified as a guy, but he loves me for me, as a women or a man or anything in between, that it doesn't matter to him. I believe him. But I can't shake the feeling that it could be better... for me at least? If I could feel more like myself, less trapped in my body and more at home in it... I'm not sure I feel like a man, but I don't feel strongly like a woman either.

Like I said, I don't know what I'm really trying to say here... I am just so confused and so sad.

Tl;dr: I am female, in a romantic/sexual relationship with a man who is almost 100% homosexual. I wanted to be a boy when I was younger, identified as trans, then changed my mind when I started the relationship.

Sorry, this might be a little long but I really appreciate your attention.\n\nI am a 24 year old person. I have a female body, and identify as bisexual, though the only person I have actually done anything with is male, and I tend to be more attracted to men. \n\nEver since I can remember, I have wished that I was a boy. This is TMI I am sure, but I remember sitting on the toilet when I was very young (elementary school age) and imagining that the hanging turds were my penis haha. Sorry. I kept my hair very short and loved when people mistook me for a boy, and I prided myself on being a tom boy and not being into girly things (dolls, pink, etc.). I had a pretty crappy childhood (my parents divorced when I was around 6, my mother is a verbally abusive alchoholic and my father is incredibly distant and probably somewhere on the autism scale) so I ended up extremely overweight, extremely depressed, and often suicidal. I also cut myself for a period of time.\n\nWhen I was in 6th grade, I met my best friend, who I will call Trevor. Trevor already at that age (12) identified as gay. Naturally I promptly fell in love with him and spent many angsty teenage years desperately wishing that I was a guy so that we could be together.\n\nWhen I went to highschool, because of Trevor's sexuality and my own, I decided to join the GSA. There, I met a guy who identified as FTM, and realized that that might be what I was too. I told my friends and the other GSA members that I was trans and was largely supported by them, although I felt too embarrassed by my body to actually try to pass as a guy or ask anyone to use a different name or pronouns for me. By that time I had long hair, was probably close to 300lbs, and wore only huge baggy black clothing and a black trenchcoat year round (all to hide myself.) Eventually I became so miserable due to my home life and bullying at school that I dropped out.\n\nI moved out of state and basically stayed in my room doing nothing but pretending to be a guy on the internet for about a year. During this time I didn't see Trevor much at all, just talked to him on the phone. Finally, though, he came to visit me and in the course of a long conversation we ended up hooking up. That first time I didn't let him do anything to me other than kiss me, but the fact that he actually liked me that way and wanted me to touch him completely blew my world view wide open.

The long version is long and I'm confused. English is not my main language, so I'm sorry for any mistakes. If something is not clear, just let me know and I'll fix it.

OK, so I'm a guy. I'm 28, Brazilian, and I'm married to a wonderful girl that I love. I have wanted to be a girl as far as I can remember, but I grew up in a traditional family and I learned it was wrong. To make me even more confuse, I am sexually attracted to women, not men.

So I grew up always telling myself to forget this bullshit of wanting to be a woman. Deep down I always wished to be Mistique (from the X-men comics), a mutant that can change her own body at will.

**When I was a teen I used to imagine myself being a woman**, with a nice body and wearing nice dresses. When I was masturbating I used to imagine me as a woman in sexy situations. But I just kept telling myself it was me thinking weird stuff because I had no girlfriend.

I started dating very late. I was 18 when I had my first kiss. I dated one girl for one year, then we broke up. Half a year later (it was 2005) I met this wonderful girl and we started dating. Many years later, in September 2012, we got married.

I am very lucky because this girl is a psychologist. During these years we are together she has helped me undo a lot of mental programming that society did to me. She helped me get rid of prejudices, fears, and a lot of stuff. We grew a lot together.

But after all this time I still imagine me as a woman to help me get aroused. I look at picturesof women wearing sexy dresses and imagine the woman is me, being sexy to my wife. I see lesbian movies and I imagine I am one of them and my wife is the other. When I have sex with my wife I imagine we're both women.

This week, for the first time in my life, I accepted that I want to be a woman. I stopped fighting against my own desires. So... **today I told my wife I want to be a woman**. She was a bit shocked, but not much. I've always been a feminine guy. Not too much feminine, I'm not mistaken for gay or anything, but not a masculine guy in behavior.

The best thing is that she will support me. She will stand by me if this is what I want for my future. **But I am afraid**.

So, after this long text, these are my main worries. In the next paragraphs I will list everything that worries me. I need your help and experience.

**1) Sex life**

I love sex and so does my wife. Can I have a regular sex life if I become a full woman? Will I still be able to have orgasms? Can I have orgasms with penetration? And masturbating by myself? Will the hormones lower my desire for sex? And can we really have full sex pleasure if she's not a lesbian?

Edit to clarify: I love sex and sexual plays, but I am (obviously?) not very satisfied with my body during sex. But even with this problem I still love sex and I think about sex almost every day.

**2) The surgery**

I am afraid of the surgery. I am a guy that almost pass out when I have to take a vaccine. When I tried to donate blood I passed out even before the needle was inside me.

Does it hurt too much? Are there significant risks of death?

And my main fear: I live in Brazil, not a first world country. What are the risks of me becoming a genderless abomination instead of a woman?

**3) I am too man-like in appearance**

I'm not too masculine in behavior, but I am very masculine in appearance. I have a lot of hair everywhere. A LOT. My wife said I am the hairiest man she has ever seen. I even have a lot of hair in places many other men don't have too much, like my feet. My toe has a lot of hair!

And hair is not the only problem. I have a very masculine facial structure, with a very masculine nose and a very masculine brow. With a masculine mouth.

**I want to be a pretty woman**, I don't want to look like the tranny we see here near interstate roads in Brazil that look like an ugly caricature of a woman.

I want to be a pretty woman because I want my wife to still be sexually attracted to me. I want her to desire my body. I don't mean I want to be a model. I just want to look like an average woman.

This number 3 is my main worry. Is it possible to become an attractive woman if I am a manly man? Do I have to go to other countries and do surgeries that will break the bones in my face to try and make me a prettier woman?

**EDIT**

**4) Is it too late?**

OK, I forgot to add this one. I see many people starting their treatment during teen years, or early twenties. I'm almost 29 and I'm afraid I am too old to start it now. I am afraid that I will only have **some** feminine features, but I will never look like a woman like people that started treatment when 16 years old.

I'm a long time lurker and don't post very often to ANY subreddit, so this is very new and a little frightening to me. 

I'm a biological female and recently realized that I'm genderfluid. I've only told my good friends and my boyfriend, and everyone is quite accepting of it. I bought a tri-top binder a few weeks ago and when I wear I feel like the ocean has been drained out of my lungs and I'm finally the way I was always supposed to be. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy being female-bodied. I like to look very feminine sometimes, but most of the time I feel trapped. And my binder has quickly become something I'm not comfortable going without. But a few days ago I began to really worry about what binding (a little over half of the time) would do to my breasts. I really don't want them to be damaged or extremely saggy (shit, i hate that word). My boyfriend has also expressed this concern and I really don't want to become unattractive in his eyes.  

I've read that in order to keep this from happening you can't bind more than a few times every two weeks. And this is devastating to me. I really need some help and advice and I so appreciate anyone who takes the time to hear me out and offer their experiences or opinions.

Apparently the electrician needs to see all rooms (all wall sockets and switches I assume). Great. After frantic cleaning and ordering, the place looks great, but my bedroom looks 20% like a boy's room, 50% like a girl's room and 30% like a ladies shoe shop.   

So now I'm worried that they will think I'm a weirdo/pervert or my (non-existing) girlfriend is a bit of a fashion addict. Tempted to chicken out and convince them of option 2, but that would cause problems with my landlord. So yeah. Thank you very much, health-and-safety regulations! My flat was like my only real-world safe space :(    
   
When I started to write this I thought it was funny, now I'm scared...    

Edit: 
Thanks a lot everybody for your support. You were right, it was no big deal.

Shopping centres aren't a strong point for me as I can get panicky in crowds plus the usual dose of dysphoria of not being able to wear half the stuff I wanted, wasn't as bad as usual because I didn't have to hide my  enthusiasm for shopping or clothes.  

Half way around the groom who has been my best mate for something like 9 years came up to me and said he thought he was GQ too.

152,2013-07-30 21:36:41,1jdlgm,18,16,"Context: I'm 20 years old, and physically I am a man, but sometimes I dress as a woman and I have a feminine identity. I am comfortable with society as a whole seeing me as a man. However, internally, I don't really see myself as a man *as opposed to a woman*. I feel that gender is a construct, and there are times when I feel more like a woman than a man, and that *most of the time* I don't feel like a **man** or a **woman** - I'm somewhere in between, or outside... or... something. I think genderqueer is a nice term for it. Maybe I'm a genderqueer man or something. But like I said, I don't mind the rest of the world not hearing the 'genderqueer' qualifier and just seeing me as a man when I'm out and about interacting with them (and I can be a pretty lady on my own, inside with some ice cream and a mirror :) ).

The one person who's an exception... is my girlfriend. She knows that I crossdress. She's fine with it, although she doesn't get involved herself. The thing is, when we first got together, she asked me to describe my sexuality to her in as much detail as possible, so she could really understand where I am on that spectrum. (To be honest, since I don't really believe in gender as a fixed thing, you probably won't be surprised to hear that I don't really have a fixed sexuality :p but the closest is bisexual). My girlfriend is asexual, so we are both in not-so-straightforward sexuality categories. She was really good about getting to understand my perspective on that, and early in the relationship we talked about sexuality a lot. (We don't talk about it much any more since we are comfortable with each other after being together for over a year now).

But she never has asked me 'please tell me about your gender in as much detail as possible'. So although she *knows* about my 'woman' side, she has never really acknowledged it. Every now and then I will say something about myself in a feminine context, and she often replies with ""but you're a man!"". Recently we were discussing something to do with 'geek girls' and I said something about myself, and she laughed and said ""you're not a girl!"". In this situations I usually shrug it off and say ""hah, well..."" and trail off without saying anything.

To be honest, it is not a big deal. If she sees me as a man, well, that doesn't change who I am. She has never been mean about it. I don't feel that it impedes my quality of life much or at all. It's just that at those moments, I guess the girl inside of me feels like she's being silenced, and the man (who gets most of the control of my mouth!) never stands up for her.

I don't know what to do. Is it worth bringing this up with her? Has anyone had to have a conversation like that? How did it go? What would be a good way to bring it up? I don't want to make her feel bad or overstate the situation... but I don't want to trivialise and ignore my identity around the most important person in my life, either.

Another complication is that my girlfriend is very interested in feminist issues. I consider myself a feminist as well, and have read up on feminism, but I am careful not to inject my male voice and speak for women or anything like that. I'm a white man, who is not straight but has a girlfriend, so is not obviously LGBT+ to the outside world. My girlfriend is not white, nor a man. I don't want to come across as sort of 'bandwagoning' myself into being a minority, or like I'm pretending the issues that minorities can suffer from are a big problem for me as well. This is especially relevant in that geek girl conversation - I'm sure every redditor knows that geeks who come across as women can have a pretty hard time sometimes. I'm in no danger of being seen as a woman by most people, so I don't have those problems. But I do consider myself *in some ways* a girl, and certainly a geek. So I don't want to be included in the group of 'people who suffer as a result of being both a geek and a girl', but I would like someone close to me to appreciate that actually I am both a geek and a girl, however atypical my experience of that is.
