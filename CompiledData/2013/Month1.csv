Last November my job sent out an e-mail stating that they were adding  new benefits to my insurance package, SRS surgery is one of them. This has bumped my time-table from about 3 years till I get surgery to a year or less.

I've been starting the process. I've contacted the surgeon (Marci Bowers is in my network!) and I'm working through all the paperwork and I should have a date scheduled by February at the rate I'm going. Doc Bowers schedules appointments a year out but I was told by the receptionist that I could see her within 3-6 months with cancellations.

Sorry, blabbering!

Anyways, I'm looking for advise and tips on what to expect during and after the surgery as well as anything I can do to help recover or stave off boredom. I already know that I'm going to be in the hospital for 12 days and that I need some recovery time after. 

1) How long do you think I'll be sitting around before I can move around freely? I exercise and bicycle a lot, how long do I have to wait before getting back on the saddle? 

2) I'm a foodie, how long after surgery can I eat? I ask because I remember hearing that my lower-half will be bandaged up so I imagine I wont be able to eat/use the bathroom for awhile

3) Should I change my diet or be aware of medication changes?

4) What do you suggest I do to keep the boredom of recovery away?

33,2013-01-20 23:59:22,16ygfx,9,7,"Hey Reddit. Today, January 20th, marks my first year on testosterone. Today, I just wanted to share my story in hopes that it will help any of you get started on transitioning, or maybe give you some inspiration to keep transitioning, even if you don’t see the progress right away.


I first discovered that I had GID through my girlfriend (heterosexual female), after I confessed that I really liked her. Her initial response was that she couldn’t be with a lesbian, but after I told her that I felt more like a guy and that I didn’t consider myself gay, she started doing some research (having heard of GID on a television show a while back) and began sending me articles of the disorder. Reading those symptoms felt like reading out of a diary. It was a very conflicting moment in my life, because I was relieved that I knew what was “wrong” with me, but at the same time, I knew that I was going to start a very long journey to transition.
I’m 20 years old now, but I discovered this around the fall of 2007. At that time, and some time before that, I was seeing an endocrinologist for polycystic ovarian syndrome. They put me on birth control to fix my estrogen levels, but when I realized it was doing the opposite of what I wanted, I quit going there. I had just started high school and had no idea where to turn with this information. My step-father was in the military at the time, so we have military insurance(known for not being LGBT friendly). Our hospital was on a military base, so the awkwardness of going to the doctors while looking like a different gender was multiplied by the fact that it was a military hospital. 

The first person I told, my girlfriend aside, was my mother. My mom and I have always had a good relationship, and she has always been extremely supportive of me. She always assumed that I would be gay, because she noticed how tomboyish I was from an early age (didn’t like dolls, didn’t like girly clothes, and didn’t like long hair). She was very supportive and wanted to make sure that I knew what this entailed for me, and she also wanted me to know that even though she would support me, she and my step-father would be unable to do so financially in the long-run. 

I bided my time through highschool, unsure of exactly how to go about getting testosterone injections. I knew that in order to have surgery I needed to be diagnosed by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, so I told my mother that I wanted counseling. I was pretty depressed in middle school, and was getting extremely stressed out by trying to figure out what to do. I got permission to see a psychiatrist from my insurance, and when I explained everything to her, she told me that although she was very convinced that I had GID, we couldn’t put that down as the main reason for me seeing her, because my insurance didn’t cover it. We had to put depression. I stopped seeing her after a few months.

Time passed, I watched youtube videos and read a lot of forums on surgery types, costs, and different methods of hormonal treatment. As someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my testosterone levels were already higher than normal, so I had more facial/body hair, and my voice was slightly lower than most girls. I passed pretty well as a male just from face-to-face interaction, but my voice and breasts were what really gave me away. My sophomore year, I started wearing a binder. It wasn’t the best, as I have really large breasts (thanks mom) but it was better than the sports bras I was wearing. I figured that my name change was what I needed to do next. This was difficult because I was born in Germany, on an American base, and any change to my birth certificate would have to be done through an American Consulate. 

My senior year, I shortened my name from “Brittany” to “Brit.” I told some of my closer friends what I intended to do, but I knew that even after changing my name and starting to transition, it would be difficult because I was going to go to college in the same town that I graduated, which many of my classmates did as well. The end of senior year was tough, because they separated gown colors by gender, and females were required to wear a dress or skirt underneath their gown. I spoke to a very nice vice-principal privately and told her about my disorder, but our principal wouldn’t allow me to wear male colors and sit with the guys. I would, however, be allowed to wear shorts under my gown, and my name would be announced as “Brit _____,” and not my girly full first and middle name. 

Immediately following my graduation (June of 2011) I started my name change. I found a local attorney and I dropped $600 to have my name legally changed. I then had to deal with the long wait of processing through the American consulate after sending them documents mid-July of 2011. I had to return my birth certificate (which was a replacement of my original certificate that had been lost during my parents’ divorce), send in the legal name change papers, and pay $50 dollars to have a new one made. After two months of waiting, I was informed I would need a signed document from a notary verifying that it was a replacement birth certificate. 

I included a request to have my gender marker changed, and explained my situation. I was emailed and informed that in order to have the gender marker changed, I would need “a notarized physician’s letter that documents subject’s sexual reconstructive surgery that includes the following:
&gt; * Medial license or certificate number

&gt; * Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate

&gt; * Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to physician

&gt; * Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct. 

I was happy to learn exactly what I would need to do so in the future. I received this letter at the end of October, and it was already halfway through my first college semester. My name was still Brittany. I went and spoke directly to an executive in admissions at my college, and explained the situation. I told her that I really wanted my name changed because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would take before I received the paperwork, and that I felt uncomfortable with my name in my classes. She was very nice about and said she would see what she could do. She ended up changing my name in the system, and said that I would need to turn in the necessary documents as soon as possible (i.e., new driver’s license, new social security card, and new birth certificate). 

December rolled around and I finally got the paperwork from the American Consulate. Changing my drivers license was very easy, but I was nervous because I had heard that a lot of trans get flak from people at the DMV. I thought I would need my new birth certificate, but I found out that all I really needed was my legal name change documents (so I could have had my driver’s license changed since the summer… *facepalm*). Next was the social security office, and they asked for the legal name change paperwork, my new birth certificate, and my ID. That also went over very smoothly.

At the end of December, I decided to go and see my old Endocrinologist to see if there was anything they could do for me. I spoke to my doctor, told him that I have GID and that I wanted to start hormonal therapy, and if he knew of any place that I could go to because my insurance wouldn’t pay for it. My doctor said that they could take care of me, and that he actually had a few other patients who were trans that were being treated there. I was so relieved, and made an appointment for blood work, and then an injection. 

Although I pay out of pockets, my injections are kept off of the record from my insurance company and I have a $12 copay to have actual doctor visits. My injections are $39 per injection, but most of the price is a fee to have a nurse administer the injection (required by my Endocrinologist because of their company policy, it may be different for you). I get these twice a month and see my Endocrinologist once every 3-4 months.

My first injection was January 20th, 2012. Already having more testosterone than normal because of my POS, most of my changes happened quickly—within the first 3-5 months of being on testosterone. Some of the good things: my voice deepened pretty quickly, I noticed a steep increase in facial and body hair, and there’s definitely been an increase in libido, although I already had a pretty active sex drive before T. Some of the bad things: my acne got worse (again), and I get a lot more irritable and angry around injection time. 

Here’s a sample of how much my voice has changed (Sorry for the quality of the first one):

Here’s an example of my facial hair. I trimmed recently, so it usually looks fuller than this.

Today, January 20th, marks my first year on testosterone. Today, I just wanted to share my story in hopes that it will help any of you get started on transitioning, or maybe give you some inspiration to keep transitioning, even if you don’t see the progress right away.\n\n\nI first discovered that I had GID through my girlfriend (heterosexual female), after I confessed that I really liked her. Her initial response was that she couldn’t be with a lesbian, but after I told her that I felt more like a guy and that I didn’t consider myself gay, she started doing some research (having heard of GID on a television show a while back) and began sending me articles of the disorder. Reading those symptoms felt like reading out of a diary. It was a very conflicting moment in my life, because I was relieved that I knew what was “wrong” with me, but at the same time, I knew that I was going to start a very long journey to transition.\nI’m 20 years old now, but I discovered this around the fall of 2007. At that time, and some time before that, I was seeing an endocrinologist for polycystic ovarian syndrome. They put me on birth control to fix my estrogen levels, but when I realized it was doing the opposite of what I wanted, I quit going there. I had just started high school and had no idea where to turn with this information. My step-father was in the military at the time, so we have military insurance(known for not being LGBT friendly). Our hospital was on a military base, so the awkwardness of going to the doctors while looking like a different gender was multiplied by the fact that it was a military hospital. \n\nThe first person I told, my girlfriend aside, was my mother. My mom and I have always had a good relationship, and she has always been extremely supportive of me. She always assumed that I would be gay, because she noticed how tomboyish I was from an early age (didn’t like dolls, didn’t like girly clothes, and didn’t like long hair). She was very supportive and wanted to make sure that I knew what this entailed for me, and she also wanted me to know that even though she would support me, she and my step-father would be unable to do so financially in the long-run. \n\nI bided my time through highschool, unsure of exactly how to go about getting testosterone injections. I knew that in order to have surgery I needed to be diagnosed by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, so I told my mother that I wanted counseling. I was pretty depressed in middle school, and was getting extremely stressed out by trying to figure out what to do. I got permission to see a psychiatrist from my insurance, and when I explained everything to her, she told me that although she was very convinced that I had GID, we couldn’t put that down as the main reason for me seeing her, because my insurance didn’t cover it. We had to put depression. I stopped seeing her after a few months.\n\nTime passed, I watched youtube videos and read a lot of forums on surgery types, costs, and different methods of hormonal treatment. As someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my testosterone levels were already higher than normal, so I had more facial/body hair, and my voice was slightly lower than most girls. I passed pretty well as a male just from face-to-face interaction, but my voice and breasts were what really gave me away. My sophomore year, I started wearing a binder. It wasn’t the best, as I have really large breasts (thanks mom) but it was better than the sports bras I was wearing. I figured that my name change was what I needed to do next. This was difficult because I was born in Germany, on an American base, and any change to my birth certificate would have to be done through an American Consulate. \n\nMy senior year, I shortened my name from “Brittany” to “Brit.” I told some of my closer friends what I intended to do, but I knew that even after changing my name and starting to transition, it would be difficult because I was going to go to college in the same town that I graduated, which many of my classmates did as well. The end of senior year was tough, because they separated gown colors by gender, and females were required to wear a dress or skirt underneath their gown. I spoke to a very nice vice-principal privately and told her about my disorder, but our principal wouldn’t allow me to wear male colors and sit with the guys. I would, however, be allowed to wear shorts under my gown, and my name would be announced as “Brit _____,” and not my girly full first and middle name. \n\nImmediately following my graduation (June of 2011) I started my name change. I found a local attorney and I dropped $600 to have my name legally changed. I then had to deal with the long wait of processing through the American consulate after sending them documents mid-July of 2011. I had to return my birth certificate (which was a replacement of my original certificate that had been lost during my parents’ divorce), send in the legal name change papers, and pay $50 dollars to have a new one made. After two months of waiting, I was informed I would need a signed document from a notary verifying that it was a replacement birth certificate. \n\nI included a request to have my gender marker changed, and explained my situation. I was emailed and informed that in order to have the gender marker changed, I would need “a notarized physician’s letter that documents subject’s sexual reconstructive surgery that includes the following:\n&gt; * Medial license or certificate number\n\n&gt; * Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate\n\n&gt; * Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to physician\n\n&gt; * Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct. \n\nI was happy to learn exactly what I would need to do so in the future. I received this letter at the end of October, and it was already halfway through my first college semester. My name was still Brittany. I went and spoke directly to an executive in admissions at my college, and explained the situation. I told her that I really wanted my name changed because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would take before I received the paperwork, and that I felt uncomfortable with my name in my classes. She was very nice about and said she would see what she could do. She ended up changing my name in the system, and said that I would need to turn in the necessary documents as soon as possible (i.e., new driver’s license, new social security card, and new birth certificate). \n\nDecember rolled around and I finally got the paperwork from the American Consulate. Changing my drivers license was very easy, but I was nervous because I had heard that a lot of trans get flak from people at the DMV. I thought I would need my new birth certificate, but I found out that all I really needed was my legal name change documents (so I could have had my driver’s license changed since the summer… *facepalm*).

Recently, I've stopped cutting my hair short due to a sudden desire to grow out my hair, and even got some cute bangs a week ago (mostly to get my hair out of my face). I've switched from light binding and exercise bras to basic underwire ""regular"" bras, as well as to more form-fitting clothing. I'm also wearing basic makeup almost daily, which is sort of new and daunting to me.

I'm not sure *why* exactly I've felt inclined to present myself this way, maybe I'm just testing the waters to see if I'm my comfort level with this is different from a few years ago. I really like how long hair looks, possibly because I've had trichotillomania for forever and that was never an option to try out before.

7,2013-01-03 02:03:38,15v1os,6,6,"I am in need of some candid advice. This will likely go beyond the borders of gender identity, and I hope I can get pointed in some good directions. It’s taken many hours of thought and months of considering before I made this post. If I use incorrect terminology, I apologize and will correct it ASAP. I know it’s way too long, but I need to get this all out and have someone – anyone – read it without major judging.

I am MAAB in my mid-twenties. I have an invisible physical disability that affects my motor control on my right side. It limits me in certain ways, but I have to tell most people its there. Since I can remember, I’ve struggled with personal identity, but it’s gotten worse in recent months. I know what my hobbies are. I know what my skills are, and I know what my personality is like. Everything else is negotiable. 

I have a disconnect with my body. I’m not sure what term can describe it. I have trouble recognizing or reconciling myself in images and videos of me. When I go to the bathroom mirror, I have no idea what to expect. When I look, it takes a half second or second for my brain to go ‘that’s me!’ regardless of what I see. It even unnerves me some to see that it moves as I move. I sometimes can look at a photo for ten seconds before I notice that I’m in the foreground. Since I was six or seven, I’ve thought about why I can’t just change my shape with just a snap of my fingers. The only times that I feel less awkward in that sense is when I have some sort of face covering: mostly masks and helmets.

I don’t like the feeling of being limited in the physical aspect of who I am. I don’t get tattoos for that reason. While I enjoy seeing them on others, the idea of permanency with my body scares me. To be clear, I don’t hate my body. I don’t shy away from photos. I can look great in photos and in the mirror, and still feel that alienation.

I’m a costumer/cosplayer.  I’m part of a charity group that raises money or helps others through costuming, on top of many other reasons. I’ve been on local news seven times in the past year, including recycled stories, and a few times in the papers. Becoming someone else is old hat to me. I mentioned helmets and masks before: when I can’t recognize my usual self in the mirror or photos, I’m happier.

The onset of actual self-exploration came rather late to me – I was so busy with high school and university, I pushed everything about me aside for the things I needed to get done. It’s only been in the eighteen months since I graduated that I’ve really started asking myself who I am. Being called a man feels all the way wrong and woman was worse. I’ve often thought of my genitalia so distantly that I think of it like soft clay. If I were to shove with the heel of my palm, it would just smooth out and I wouldn’t care.

One thing that kind of shocked me (and I’m still getting over) is that I’m probably asexual. The absence of any sexual desire at all meant that I had no ‘what I want’ axis to counterpoint the ‘who I am’ in some sort of human graph. Made it harder to steer, as it were. That’s largely a topic I’ll discuss in the asexuality subreddit.

About eight months ago I was introduced to the concept of genderqueer and fluid identity. At the time, I largely overlooked it as something I should think about. I thought I understood it as wanting to sit on the fence of the gender spectrum. I was somewhat wrong, we can all agree.

I should have taken to the signals of having no expectation for my body. Three months ago (which gives you an idea of how long I’ve been lurking) I came across [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/108alt/gender_roles_vs_gender_identity/) and the commenters (Ray in particular) made something resonate so loudly I could swear that I heard a tuning fork. I’ve done a great deal of pondering since then.

A little list of events that have poked at me about all this in the past couple years:


* In early 2011, a scheduling mishap caused me to grow my hair longer than two inches for the first time in my life. It ended up growing for six months. I was in a break room at work and was talking to a friend when I mentioned I was probably going to get my hair cut soon. Three female coworkers of an age with me, not even in the conversation all blurted ‘No!’ I was thrown for a loop. They all went on to say that long hair looked much better on me. I have ended up keeping it longer than average since then, to the chagrin of relatives. At its longest, the back and back/sides could touch the collar of a t-shirt.

* I’m happier in the mirror with long hair, the halo of it felt like a mane of courage. I oddly especially like it when its messy, though not dirty.

* While having long hair, I’ve had several people mistake me for female from behind during coat-wearing months. I wasn’t offended, I was pleased. Was unsure why.

* Being underemployed, I got a security license to do more work where I could. However, most security companies had the stipulation that men must have really short hair for safety reasons and to ‘look professional.’ Women can have long hair, though, as long as it’s tied back. I seriously questioned the logic in the distinction.

* I got my hair cut by a new person this fall, and showed her several photos of the previous six months. I was told that if these are dated accurately, my hair growth is almost twice as fast as others. When she cut it to security-job standards, I realized that it looked more feminine to me than my long hair. Seriously questioned myself on why it mattered.

* More and more, I see female-intended clothing and realize I could probably ‘rock that look pretty hard’

* I live in a very LGBT friendly city. One local geek hangout I like had two ladies’ nights that appealed to me, and included the fact that they are both accepting female-identified and genderqueer individuals. Seriously considered going, but some female friends would be at either event and I was so not ready for anything like that.

* For Christmas 2012, this past week, I had asked for a mannequin for my costumes. My brother gave me a headless female one for Christmas, perfectly wrapped so that none of it was showing but the paper was a second skin. My family got a kick out of it, and brought it to the dinner table for Christmas dinner and put it next to me, calling it by the female version of my name. You have no idea how strange it felt, considering they are rather conservative.

A bit of my verdict from these events and thought: I don’t think I have a gender identity. I don’t really have an urge to strive for androgyny, though the idea of gender expression is still an important issue. And it worries me from lack of confidence. In an ideal world, my gender expression would be no different than picking what sweater I want today. It would change every day. Very feminine or masculine, depending on my mood, like it were a red or blue shirt. 

Being a costumer/improvisation person, becoming other people is second nature to me. Different postures, stances, voices, you name it. But we all know costumes and cosplay isn’t real. I know they aren’t. The problem with experimenting with gender expression in the everyday for me is that as a (possible?) agender, is that it’s ‘fake’ – even to me. My current expression, as close as it is to my birth gender already, still feels like it’s put on. I think I lack the confidence to present the way I want because I don’t see it as being ‘me’, just ‘me today.’ 

I don’t want others to see this gender apathy as me playing games, nor as something that has to be super-serious all the time. I have the normal anxieties about what friends (who are largely LGBTQ friendly!), family, and employers would think about me, but I definitely don’t want others to think I’m a fraud for wanting to do whatever I feel like – even if it’s nothing out of the ordinary and call myself genderqueer. My family would definitely be the biggest hurdle, of course.

There are several LGBTQ locations (and a gay village) in my city, and several of them host genderqueer/trans evenings. I’ve been considering going, but my lack of commitment or divergent expression thus far would push me to the outside. I also feel that the moment I make any move about anything, all eyes are going to be on me and even if I cut things off it could all come back to bite me. I’m financially vulnerable and a misstep could hurt me hard.

EDIT: Just wanted to add, I live with two roommates, not my family. My roommates have no clue, either.

Does anyone have advice for this rambler? I have no idea how to proceed. ‘Coming out’ – if that’s what I should call it – would be hard even to my LGBTQ friends. Just pressing this submit button is a huge deal for me.

PS: If you think you know me personally after this exhaustive description, shoot me a PM to confirm or deny. I could use a confidential friend to talk to in my city.

9,2013-01-03 17:21:24,15wa0f,3,9,"I apologize in advance if this post gets too long. 

I am 21, MAAB, and have mainly identified as a gay male since around age 16. For the last several years I have been questioning that identity. I have had general feelings of gender dysphoria through the years but have never felt like I could identify as female. However, I have become more and more uncomfortable with a strictly male identity, and have gone back and forth about it a lot. Last year I took a more gender neutral name with my friends and was open to them about being genderqueer. Having an awesome and diverse social circle, they were more than supportive. However, after 6 months or so I reverted back to my birth name, partially because of criticism from various family's members (who don't know anything about my gender identity, but had heard about the name change and expressed their dislike of it). The other reason was that I was starting to feel more secure about a male identity (though I qualified it by adding ""gender variant"" in front of it) and thought I could be okay with it again. 

Things don't magically work like that though. I've been through a lot lately, including getting medication for previously untreated bipolar disorder and anxiety. My general confidence and happiness has greatly improved. But my confusion and discontent about this continues. I'm afraid that if I keep going forward in my life without addressing this I will eventually crack. The thing is... I don't know how to actively embrace or act on my feelings. I like typical male fashion most of the time, and while I like wearing somewhat androgynous clothing at times and like wearing a certain amount of makeup when going out, it's nothing that people don't just attribute to me being gay. I dont want to change how I dress just to conform to social ideas of ""feminine"", and I guess its more of a body thing for me. I'm fairly tall and deep voiced, both if which I dislike, and more than that I simply don't have a feminine body type at all. I struggle a lot with my body image, and while I would never get gender reassignment survey (I'm happy with what is between my legs) I sometimes have such strong body dysphoria I feel suicidal. Though my parents are very accepting of my presented orientation, they seem much more ambivalent about when it comes to atypical gender presentation/identity, and I feel like they are both strongly attached to my male identity (especially my mother) whether I am gay or not. I am scared shitless when it comes to talking about these things with them.

So there's the long word dump I apologized for, and now I'll ask a few questions... Firstly, is it possible to get hormone therapy if you don't have a binary gender identity and don't want to fully transition to the opposite gender? Does anyone have any experiences or thoughts about this? Second, does anyone have any advice on how to embrace/express a more androgynous identity besides changing how I dress? Third, how can I address this when it comes to relationships?  I am afraid of getting into relationships because I don't want someone to fall for for me only identifying me as male. I want them to understand and accept my non-binary identity and feel attracted to it - I don't want to just have a gay boyfriend who sees me as an effeminate male. Am I over-thinking that, or am I justified feeling like it really matters? 

Any and all feedback, advice, support, or sharing would be wonderfully appreciated.",genderqueer,Struggling and lost - advice on expression and relationships please?

Though my parents are very accepting of my presented orientation, they seem much more ambivalent about when it comes to atypical gender presentation/identity, and I feel like they are both strongly attached to my male identity (especially my mother) whether I am gay or not. I am scared shitless when it comes to talking about these things with them.\n\nSo there\'s the long word dump I apologized for, and now I\'ll ask a few questions... Firstly, is it possible to get hormone therapy if you don\'t have a binary gender identity and don\'t want to fully transition to the opposite gender? Does anyone have any experiences or thoughts about this? Second, does anyone have any advice on how to embrace/express a more androgynous identity besides changing how I dress? Third, how can I address this when it comes to relationships?  I am afraid of getting into relationships because I don\'t want someone to fall for for me only identifying me as male. I want them to understand and accept my non-binary identity and feel attracted to it - I don\'t want to just have a gay boyfriend who sees me as an effeminate male. Am I over-thinking that, or am I justified feeling like it really matters? \n\nAny and all feedback, advice, support, or sharing would be wonderfully appreciated.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Struggling and lost - advice on expression and relationships please?

If I were being honest (and I promise I was) I would say that these results are accurate. But then I’m sitting here thinking about it and I find myself questioning my own answers. Are these results true to me as I present in society and therefore only partially accurate or did I subconsciously answer the questions as I feel I truly am? In which case, are my recent thoughts and feelings about my gender identity irrelevant? I don’t want to believe that but I can only draw that conclusion now. I can’t imagine that all of this confusion within my thoughts about me and my thoughts about society are just fabricated to give myself this ideal that there is a reason I’ve never accepted myself as the stereotypical female citizen I’ve always craved I would someday conform to. I refuse to accept that in my own personal rebellion I’ve clung to this idea that it wasn’t me that there was something wrong with, it was societies opinions. And now I’m just confusing myself even further. I just wanted some shred of hope to cling to in all of my confusion that in my own bubble of knowledge I firmly believed that I was okay and they were the ones who were fucked up but I’m not sure anymore. I’m not sure about anything.

Edit:
I really appreciate everyone opinions and thoughts about my problem and I agree that this shouldn't be taken seriously. I just had a shit night where I was questioning everything. I am slowly working toward defining myself before I let something else define me. Thanks a lot for all your input!!

So, I don't really know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a vent.


Basically my issue is that while I've recently started identifying as genderqueer after a lifetime of not knowing there was a label for my weirdness. BUT- I am also ""blessed"" by my birth body, which I realistically admit is a gorgeous example of the tall, lean feminine figure. To boot, it naturally sits at a ""perfect"" weight of slender-with-curves, regardless of what I eat or do. Women every day ask me if they can borrow my figure and metabolism please.


I have a lovely body. It's extremely aesthetically appealing and were I not in it I'd find it very attractive. But it's not MY body, and it doesn't reflect the way I feel or think 95% of the time. I don't really want it and to be frank I don't like being in it much at all.


I'm carrying a lot of guilt about not wanting a body I know I'm privileged to have. Anyone got ideas for how I can either come to terms with or move past this? I also don't know what I DO want my body to look like, since every time I try to think about it I get caught in the mindfuck that is what society tells those of us who are FAAB that we should want to look like. How do I explore what I want to present as without saying a grand ""fuck you"" to women who sweat and bleed to look more like I already do?

BUT- I am also ""blessed"" by my birth body, which I realistically admit is a gorgeous example of the tall, lean feminine figure. To boot, it naturally sits at a ""perfect"" weight of slender-with-curves, regardless of what I eat or do. Women every day ask me if they can borrow my figure and metabolism please.\n\n\nI have a lovely body. It\'s extremely aesthetically appealing and were I not in it I\'d find it very attractive. But it\'s not MY body, and it doesn\'t reflect the way I feel or think 95% of the time. I don\'t really want it and to be frank I don\'t like being in it much at all.\n\n\nI\'m carrying a lot of guilt about not wanting a body I know I\'m privileged to have. Anyone got ideas for how I can either come to terms with or move past this? I also don\'t know what I DO want my body to look like, since every time I try to think about it I get caught in the mindfuck that is what society tells those of us who are FAAB that we should want to look like. How do I explore what I want to present as without saying a grand ""fuck you"" to women who sweat and bleed to look more like I already do?\n\n\n\nWow, even this whole post seems guilt-worthy to me.

I want to be pretty. Now, coming from a male that is 190 lbs, 5'10"", and built like a fucking viking, a statement like that might seem a bit odd, or silly. But it's how I feel: I want to be pretty, I want to *feel* pretty. Let me explain. 

Firstly, I am somebody who is masculine for the most part, I like sports and guns, I listen to and make loud and obnoxius music, etc. I am a stereotypical male in many respects. But I am also not stereotypical in other respects. So I wouldn't necessarily want to betray a side of me that is very real by dressing/behaving/generally being something other than that.

However, I have no desire to act like a female either. I don't want to drag. I don't really want to wear makeup (though my understanding of cosmetics and their power over human image is shoddy at best (remember the part where I'm a stereotypical guy?)), nor do I want to wear women's clothing or act like a female. I just want to feel like I'm one.

What I mean is, I want to be a guy, but I don't want to be handsome. I don't want to be suave or dapper or anything like it. I want to be a guy, but I want to be pretty.

SO, my question after all that is this: Firstly, is this a genderqueer type of feeling, and if so, can any of you offer me any advice? If it is not, can you identify what this feeling is, and direct me to something/one/place that could help me?

My names Avery, and I'm FAAB, androgynous leaning genderqueer. Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm proud of being a woman, but I'm also proud of being genderqueer. My physical sex is different from my gender (most of the time) but I am proud of both. I feel women are strong people who have seen lots of hardship in our history, and I'm proud of my female identity. I'm also very proud of my androgynous leaning identity, and I actually present as mostly male. It's weird for me to put it out there so plainly, but I figure if anyone does, the people who will most understand it outside of my best friends, would be in this subreddit.

I do have a lot of dysphoria, and it mostly connects to 2 things. One is my weight, and one is my chest. Right now I'm 234 lbs, and at 5'4"" it really shows. I've been working out and have begun to lose weight, so that I can handle on my own.

My chest, however, is a bigger problem. I don't want it at all. For awhile I thought I might go in for another reduction when the time comes, but I doubt that getting A cups is going to be possible. I have been putting more and more thought into the idea of a total top surgery.

Is it possible for someone who isn't taking T to do this? Does anyone know of a person who has had this sort of experience? I know that mastectomies are done, of course, for women suffering from breast cancer, but would any surgeon do top surgery on a non-binary trans person who isn't on hormones?

I just don't want to have to wear a binder every day of my life...

4. Wear a suitably formal jumpsuit. If I can find one that's non-awful enough (but still formal enough), I could maybe do this.

She is also reading it currently and so far finds it interesting.  I asked her if it covered any transgender issues relating to the Bible, and she mentioned something about how he used LGBT a lot in the book, but as we all know, LGBT does not always include the T.  I was wondering if anyone had read this book and could clue me in on if it did cover transgender issues, because if my mom could be swayed with a religious argument, it would make my life a hell of a lot easier coming out to her.

I have never much liked my body because I always felt it restricted me socially. I don't feel like I'm a woman, though I don't really feel like I'm a man.

I found out about gender neutral pronouns, I'm sure some of you have heard of them. Ze instead of he or she and hir instead of her or him. I like this idea, and am completely on board with it. I tried to get my partner (who adamantly prefers the term boyfriend for himself and girlfriend for me) to start using gender neutrals when referring to me, but he says he can't do that.

 That being said, I'm afraid this might be too much for him. He will never be able to use gender neutral pronouns, he will never be able to not view me as female on some level because of his...how did he put this...having sex with me? I can't word it right. The general idea is there.

83,2013-01-31 21:44:06,17njyd,1,4,"Note: sorry for the long text, and this is a throw-away account.

I think I'm genderqueer. I know my body doesn't suit my true identification. Where do I go from there?

I have a lot of sexual strugles and issues. I was raised as an androgynous tomboy girl in a shitty backward conservative poop hole. With people denying my birth assigned gender, accusing me of being gay or a guy and invalidating me, all of that forced me into a whole struggle to fit the gender status quo: dating guys to prove I'm not gay and an actual girl etc. This, without a doubt, fucked me up deeply. Years of therapy + pschotherapy + suicidal tendencies + very low self esteem and self loath after sex confirms this.

I just got out of a cis heterosexual relationship and came out to my parents (who totally ignored the issue) that I'm possibly gay and want to start dating girls. I'm currently dating a lovely trans woman, my first gay experience, and have been tagging a long with her in the community. I've been learning a lot and been trying to finally find an identity.

I dont want to be labeled something else than a woman. I struggled a lot to accept this for years and years. Revoking this would shatter my world. I dont want to eliminate it. But I'm also aware that I dislike female pronouns in a way. I feel like I'm being sexualized. (surprise surprise...) I've been trying to experience with different pronouns but I fail at keeping up. The male one did not work with me at all. I use the gender neutral ones without even noticing sometimes.

As far as sexuality go, do genderqueers experience hate towards their genitals? does anyone experience deep self loath after sex? even though I wanted to do it and I'm horny, sometimes i can feel a crisis coming and I really have to stop myself from actually doing it so I dont break down and cry my eyes out during sex and run into the shower.

I dislike the look of penises but I guess they feel good inside of me in a horrific shameful way. I'm ashamed. Deeply. I feel dominated with penetration and I hate it. Seeing semen dripping down on my thighs made me want to barf. And I cant believe I put up with this shit just cause ""all women do it"". Accepting my woman hood was always some sort of a ""giving in to the bullies"" feeling. I want to change. I want to liberate myself. I'm tired of this. I want sex to feel good without guilt and shame.

Often, I wish I could be asexual and agender in a way. I've looked up hysterectomy, and the idea of cutting my genitals and sexual parts is infact appealing to me. I've also looked up chemical castration. Infact, I enjoy my ssri for that benefit mostly.

As far as clothing goes, I've been experiencing with more feminine clothing recently when I feel happy. However, on an everyday basis, I aim for the androgynous / butch /edgy type of look even though I look quiet feminine now with long hair.

Any guidance, comments, anything, especially some mirroring and validation will be deeply appreciated.

Recently, I've stopped cutting my hair short due to a sudden desire to grow out my hair, and even got some cute bangs a week ago (mostly to get my hair out of my face). I've switched from light binding and exercise bras to basic underwire ""regular"" bras, as well as to more form-fitting clothing. I'm also wearing basic makeup almost daily, which is sort of new and daunting to me. Nobody at school or home seems to care or react much, although I've been getting more people saying ""you look nice/pretty today!"", which I honestly have no idea how to react to other than a quick thanks and an uncomfortable smile.

I'm not sure *why* exactly I've felt inclined to present myself this way, maybe I'm just testing the waters to see if I'm my comfort level with this is different from a few years ago. I really like how long hair looks, possibly because I've had trichotillomania for forever and that was never an option to try out before.

I'm not comfortable with my legs or pits shaved, but I'm also not confident enough to have two ""clashing"" aspects of my gender identity expressed together in public (*someday, fuzzy legs and a summer dress!*). I honestly wish I could shapeshift my body whenever I felt a special inclination to whatever part of me I wanted to express the most on the outside. I could have shoulder length hair and lovely curves one day, and then the next just cut it all off and have a flat chest and be five inches taller. Alas, that isn't how it works.

9,2013-01-03 02:03:38,15v1os,6,6,"I am in need of some candid advice. This will likely go beyond the borders of gender identity, and I hope I can get pointed in some good directions. It’s taken many hours of thought and months of considering before I made this post. If I use incorrect terminology, I apologize and will correct it ASAP. I know it’s way too long, but I need to get this all out and have someone – anyone – read it without major judging.

I am MAAB in my mid-twenties. I have an invisible physical disability that affects my motor control on my right side. It limits me in certain ways, but I have to tell most people its there. Since I can remember, I’ve struggled with personal identity, but it’s gotten worse in recent months. I know what my hobbies are. I know what my skills are, and I know what my personality is like. Everything else is negotiable. 

I have a disconnect with my body. I’m not sure what term can describe it. I have trouble recognizing or reconciling myself in images and videos of me. When I go to the bathroom mirror, I have no idea what to expect. When I look, it takes a half second or second for my brain to go ‘that’s me!’ regardless of what I see. It even unnerves me some to see that it moves as I move. I sometimes can look at a photo for ten seconds before I notice that I’m in the foreground. Since I was six or seven, I’ve thought about why I can’t just change my shape with just a snap of my fingers. The only times that I feel less awkward in that sense is when I have some sort of face covering: mostly masks and helmets.

I don’t like the feeling of being limited in the physical aspect of who I am. I don’t get tattoos for that reason. While I enjoy seeing them on others, the idea of permanency with my body scares me. To be clear, I don’t hate my body. I don’t shy away from photos. I can look great in photos and in the mirror, and still feel that alienation.

I’m a costumer/cosplayer.  I’m part of a charity group that raises money or helps others through costuming, on top of many other reasons. I’ve been on local news seven times in the past year, including recycled stories, and a few times in the papers. Becoming someone else is old hat to me. I mentioned helmets and masks before: when I can’t recognize my usual self in the mirror or photos, I’m happier.

The onset of actual self-exploration came rather late to me – I was so busy with high school and university, I pushed everything about me aside for the things I needed to get done. It’s only been in the eighteen months since I graduated that I’ve really started asking myself who I am. Being called a man feels all the way wrong and woman was worse. I’ve often thought of my genitalia so distantly that I think of it like soft clay. If I were to shove with the heel of my palm, it would just smooth out and I wouldn’t care.

One thing that kind of shocked me (and I’m still getting over) is that I’m probably asexual. The absence of any sexual desire at all meant that I had no ‘what I want’ axis to counterpoint the ‘who I am’ in some sort of human graph. Made it harder to steer, as it were. That’s largely a topic I’ll discuss in the asexuality subreddit.

About eight months ago I was introduced to the concept of genderqueer and fluid identity. At the time, I largely overlooked it as something I should think about. I thought I understood it as wanting to sit on the fence of the gender spectrum. I was somewhat wrong, we can all agree.

I should have taken to the signals of having no expectation for my body. Three months ago (which gives you an idea of how long I’ve been lurking) I came across [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/108alt/gender_roles_vs_gender_identity/) and the commenters (Ray in particular) made something resonate so loudly I could swear that I heard a tuning fork. I’ve done a great deal of pondering since then.

A little list of events that have poked at me about all this in the past couple years:


* In early 2011, a scheduling mishap caused me to grow my hair longer than two inches for the first time in my life. It ended up growing for six months. I was in a break room at work and was talking to a friend when I mentioned I was probably going to get my hair cut soon. Three female coworkers of an age with me, not even in the conversation all blurted ‘No!’ I was thrown for a loop. They all went on to say that long hair looked much better on me. I have ended up keeping it longer than average since then, to the chagrin of relatives. At its longest, the back and back/sides could touch the collar of a t-shirt.

* I’m happier in the mirror with long hair, the halo of it felt like a mane of courage. I oddly especially like it when its messy, though not dirty.

* While having long hair, I’ve had several people mistake me for female from behind during coat-wearing months. I wasn’t offended, I was pleased. Was unsure why.

* Being underemployed, I got a security license to do more work where I could. However, most security companies had the stipulation that men must have really short hair for safety reasons and to ‘look professional.’ Women can have long hair, though, as long as it’s tied back. I seriously questioned the logic in the distinction.

* I got my hair cut by a new person this fall, and showed her several photos of the previous six months. I was told that if these are dated accurately, my hair growth is almost twice as fast as others. When she cut it to security-job standards, I realized that it looked more feminine to me than my long hair. Seriously questioned myself on why it mattered.

* More and more, I see female-intended clothing and realize I could probably ‘rock that look pretty hard’

* I live in a very LGBT friendly city. One local geek hangout I like had two ladies’ nights that appealed to me, and included the fact that they are both accepting female-identified and genderqueer individuals. Seriously considered going, but some female friends would be at either event and I was so not ready for anything like that.

* For Christmas 2012, this past week, I had asked for a mannequin for my costumes. My brother gave me a headless female one for Christmas, perfectly wrapped so that none of it was showing but the paper was a second skin. My family got a kick out of it, and brought it to the dinner table for Christmas dinner and put it next to me, calling it by the female version of my name. You have no idea how strange it felt, considering they are rather conservative.

A bit of my verdict from these events and thought: I don’t think I have a gender identity. I don’t really have an urge to strive for androgyny, though the idea of gender expression is still an important issue. And it worries me from lack of confidence. In an ideal world, my gender expression would be no different than picking what sweater I want today. It would change every day. Very feminine or masculine, depending on my mood, like it were a red or blue shirt. 

Being a costumer/improvisation person, becoming other people is second nature to me. Different postures, stances, voices, you name it. But we all know costumes and cosplay isn’t real. I know they aren’t. The problem with experimenting with gender expression in the everyday for me is that as a (possible?) agender, is that it’s ‘fake’ – even to me. My current expression, as close as it is to my birth gender already, still feels like it’s put on. I think I lack the confidence to present the way I want because I don’t see it as being ‘me’, just ‘me today.’ 

I don’t want others to see this gender apathy as me playing games, nor as something that has to be super-serious all the time. I have the normal anxieties about what friends (who are largely LGBTQ friendly!), family, and employers would think about me, but I definitely don’t want others to think I’m a fraud for wanting to do whatever I feel like – even if it’s nothing out of the ordinary and call myself genderqueer. My family would definitely be the biggest hurdle, of course.

There are several LGBTQ locations (and a gay village) in my city, and several of them host genderqueer/trans evenings. I’ve been considering going, but my lack of commitment or divergent expression thus far would push me to the outside. I also feel that the moment I make any move about anything, all eyes are going to be on me and even if I cut things off it could all come back to bite me. I’m financially vulnerable and a misstep could hurt me hard.

EDIT: Just wanted to add, I live with two roommates, not my family. My roommates have no clue, either.

Does anyone have advice for this rambler? I have no idea how to proceed. ‘Coming out’ – if that’s what I should call it – would be hard even to my LGBTQ friends. Just pressing this submit button is a huge deal for me.

PS: If you think you know me personally after this exhaustive description, shoot me a PM to confirm or deny. I could use a confidential friend to talk to in my city.

12,2013-01-03 17:21:24,15wa0f,3,9,"I apologize in advance if this post gets too long. 

I am 21, MAAB, and have mainly identified as a gay male since around age 16. For the last several years I have been questioning that identity. I have had general feelings of gender dysphoria through the years but have never felt like I could identify as female. However, I have become more and more uncomfortable with a strictly male identity, and have gone back and forth about it a lot. Last year I took a more gender neutral name with my friends and was open to them about being genderqueer. Having an awesome and diverse social circle, they were more than supportive. However, after 6 months or so I reverted back to my birth name, partially because of criticism from various family's members (who don't know anything about my gender identity, but had heard about the name change and expressed their dislike of it). The other reason was that I was starting to feel more secure about a male identity (though I qualified it by adding ""gender variant"" in front of it) and thought I could be okay with it again. 

Things don't magically work like that though. I've been through a lot lately, including getting medication for previously untreated bipolar disorder and anxiety. My general confidence and happiness has greatly improved. But my confusion and discontent about this continues. I'm afraid that if I keep going forward in my life without addressing this I will eventually crack. The thing is... I don't know how to actively embrace or act on my feelings. I like typical male fashion most of the time, and while I like wearing somewhat androgynous clothing at times and like wearing a certain amount of makeup when going out, it's nothing that people don't just attribute to me being gay. I dont want to change how I dress just to conform to social ideas of ""feminine"", and I guess its more of a body thing for me. I'm fairly tall and deep voiced, both if which I dislike, and more than that I simply don't have a feminine body type at all. I struggle a lot with my body image, and while I would never get gender reassignment survey (I'm happy with what is between my legs) I sometimes have such strong body dysphoria I feel suicidal. Though my parents are very accepting of my presented orientation, they seem much more ambivalent about when it comes to atypical gender presentation/identity, and I feel like they are both strongly attached to my male identity (especially my mother) whether I am gay or not. I am scared shitless when it comes to talking about these things with them.

So there's the long word dump I apologized for, and now I'll ask a few questions... Firstly, is it possible to get hormone therapy if you don't have a binary gender identity and don't want to fully transition to the opposite gender? Does anyone have any experiences or thoughts about this? Second, does anyone have any advice on how to embrace/express a more androgynous identity besides changing how I dress? Third, how can I address this when it comes to relationships?  I am afraid of getting into relationships because I don't want someone to fall for for me only identifying me as male. I want them to understand and accept my non-binary identity and feel attracted to it - I don't want to just have a gay boyfriend who sees me as an effeminate male. Am I over-thinking that, or am I justified feeling like it really matters? 

Any and all feedback, advice, support, or sharing would be wonderfully appreciated.",genderqueer,Struggling and lost - advice on expression and relationships please?

If I were being honest (and I promise I was) I would say that these results are accurate. But then I’m sitting here thinking about it and I find myself questioning my own answers. Are these results true to me as I present in society and therefore only partially accurate or did I subconsciously answer the questions as I feel I truly am? In which case, are my recent thoughts and feelings about my gender identity irrelevant? I don’t want to believe that but I can only draw that conclusion now. I can’t imagine that all of this confusion within my thoughts about me and my thoughts about society are just fabricated to give myself this ideal that there is a reason I’ve never accepted myself as the stereotypical female citizen I’ve always craved I would someday conform to. I refuse to accept that in my own personal rebellion I’ve clung to this idea that it wasn’t me that there was something wrong with, it was societies opinions. And now I’m just confusing myself even further. I just wanted some shred of hope to cling to in all of my confusion that in my own bubble of knowledge I firmly believed that I was okay and they were the ones who were fucked up but I’m not sure anymore. I’m not sure about anything.

Edit:
I really appreciate everyone opinions and thoughts about my problem and I agree that this shouldn't be taken seriously. I just had a shit night where I was questioning everything. I am slowly working toward defining myself before I let something else define me. Thanks a lot for all your input!!

I am female and I identify as such but I've begun to explore what my gender means to me and how I express it.

Struggling a little bit with seasonal depression/social isolation (roommates are still gone) and sometimes when I'm walking around fretting/feeling poop, the hair seems really jarring. But the hair is off, and I can either hide or I can walk outside with my head held high and smile when I can.

I've been trying some guided imagery when I feel really lost, like some picture of how I want to look. I'm trying to picture myself looking confident and handsome. What that would look like.

So, I don't really know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a vent.


Basically my issue is that while I've recently started identifying as genderqueer after a lifetime of not knowing there was a label for my weirdness. BUT- I am also ""blessed"" by my birth body, which I realistically admit is a gorgeous example of the tall, lean feminine figure. To boot, it naturally sits at a ""perfect"" weight of slender-with-curves, regardless of what I eat or do. Women every day ask me if they can borrow my figure and metabolism please.


I have a lovely body. It's extremely aesthetically appealing and were I not in it I'd find it very attractive. But it's not MY body, and it doesn't reflect the way I feel or think 95% of the time. I don't really want it and to be frank I don't like being in it much at all.


I'm carrying a lot of guilt about not wanting a body I know I'm privileged to have. Anyone got ideas for how I can either come to terms with or move past this? I also don't know what I DO want my body to look like, since every time I try to think about it I get caught in the mindfuck that is what society tells those of us who are FAAB that we should want to look like. How do I explore what I want to present as without saying a grand ""fuck you"" to women who sweat and bleed to look more like I already do?

Unfortunately, I can't find work so when my last contract was over I moved back in with my parents. I'm in my late twenties.

As an Italian-American, I'm naturally more hairy than other FAAB folk. My mother 'taught' me to deal with this at twelve by taking me to a nail salon to wax my eyebrows and facial hair. As part of my transition, I've let my brows grow in and have taken to shaving my facial hair. My mother will not let the eyebrow thing go. She insists on taking me to the nail salon to get them waxed. I've tried telling her that I don't want to go. When she asks why not, I don't have an answer for her because I'm not ready to come out to her yet. Every few days, she whines about my eyebrows. I've tried deflecting her, but it always starts up again. 

Lately, she's kicked it up a notch by begging my femme friends to pluck them for me whenever they come over. This really makes my friends very uncomfortable since they are fully supportive of me. She also will order me to put my jacket on when she comes home to go get them done, as if I am a child. When I refuse, she asks why I'm being difficult 'like a teenager.'

79,2013-01-20 23:59:22,16ygfx,9,7,"Hey Reddit. Today, January 20th, marks my first year on testosterone. Today, I just wanted to share my story in hopes that it will help any of you get started on transitioning, or maybe give you some inspiration to keep transitioning, even if you don’t see the progress right away.


I first discovered that I had GID through my girlfriend (heterosexual female), after I confessed that I really liked her. Her initial response was that she couldn’t be with a lesbian, but after I told her that I felt more like a guy and that I didn’t consider myself gay, she started doing some research (having heard of GID on a television show a while back) and began sending me articles of the disorder. Reading those symptoms felt like reading out of a diary. It was a very conflicting moment in my life, because I was relieved that I knew what was “wrong” with me, but at the same time, I knew that I was going to start a very long journey to transition.
I’m 20 years old now, but I discovered this around the fall of 2007. At that time, and some time before that, I was seeing an endocrinologist for polycystic ovarian syndrome. They put me on birth control to fix my estrogen levels, but when I realized it was doing the opposite of what I wanted, I quit going there. I had just started high school and had no idea where to turn with this information. My step-father was in the military at the time, so we have military insurance(known for not being LGBT friendly). Our hospital was on a military base, so the awkwardness of going to the doctors while looking like a different gender was multiplied by the fact that it was a military hospital. 

The first person I told, my girlfriend aside, was my mother. My mom and I have always had a good relationship, and she has always been extremely supportive of me. She always assumed that I would be gay, because she noticed how tomboyish I was from an early age (didn’t like dolls, didn’t like girly clothes, and didn’t like long hair). She was very supportive and wanted to make sure that I knew what this entailed for me, and she also wanted me to know that even though she would support me, she and my step-father would be unable to do so financially in the long-run. 

I bided my time through highschool, unsure of exactly how to go about getting testosterone injections. I knew that in order to have surgery I needed to be diagnosed by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, so I told my mother that I wanted counseling. I was pretty depressed in middle school, and was getting extremely stressed out by trying to figure out what to do. I got permission to see a psychiatrist from my insurance, and when I explained everything to her, she told me that although she was very convinced that I had GID, we couldn’t put that down as the main reason for me seeing her, because my insurance didn’t cover it. We had to put depression. I stopped seeing her after a few months.

Time passed, I watched youtube videos and read a lot of forums on surgery types, costs, and different methods of hormonal treatment. As someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my testosterone levels were already higher than normal, so I had more facial/body hair, and my voice was slightly lower than most girls. I passed pretty well as a male just from face-to-face interaction, but my voice and breasts were what really gave me away. My sophomore year, I started wearing a binder. It wasn’t the best, as I have really large breasts (thanks mom) but it was better than the sports bras I was wearing. I figured that my name change was what I needed to do next. This was difficult because I was born in Germany, on an American base, and any change to my birth certificate would have to be done through an American Consulate. 

My senior year, I shortened my name from “Brittany” to “Brit.” I told some of my closer friends what I intended to do, but I knew that even after changing my name and starting to transition, it would be difficult because I was going to go to college in the same town that I graduated, which many of my classmates did as well. The end of senior year was tough, because they separated gown colors by gender, and females were required to wear a dress or skirt underneath their gown. I spoke to a very nice vice-principal privately and told her about my disorder, but our principal wouldn’t allow me to wear male colors and sit with the guys. I would, however, be allowed to wear shorts under my gown, and my name would be announced as “Brit _____,” and not my girly full first and middle name. 

Immediately following my graduation (June of 2011) I started my name change. I found a local attorney and I dropped $600 to have my name legally changed. I then had to deal with the long wait of processing through the American consulate after sending them documents mid-July of 2011. I had to return my birth certificate (which was a replacement of my original certificate that had been lost during my parents’ divorce), send in the legal name change papers, and pay $50 dollars to have a new one made. After two months of waiting, I was informed I would need a signed document from a notary verifying that it was a replacement birth certificate. 

I included a request to have my gender marker changed, and explained my situation. I was emailed and informed that in order to have the gender marker changed, I would need “a notarized physician’s letter that documents subject’s sexual reconstructive surgery that includes the following:
&gt; * Medial license or certificate number

&gt; * Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate

&gt; * Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to physician

&gt; * Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct. 

I was happy to learn exactly what I would need to do so in the future. I received this letter at the end of October, and it was already halfway through my first college semester. My name was still Brittany. I went and spoke directly to an executive in admissions at my college, and explained the situation. I told her that I really wanted my name changed because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would take before I received the paperwork, and that I felt uncomfortable with my name in my classes. She was very nice about and said she would see what she could do. She ended up changing my name in the system, and said that I would need to turn in the necessary documents as soon as possible (i.e., new driver’s license, new social security card, and new birth certificate). 

December rolled around and I finally got the paperwork from the American Consulate. Changing my drivers license was very easy, but I was nervous because I had heard that a lot of trans get flak from people at the DMV. I thought I would need my new birth certificate, but I found out that all I really needed was my legal name change documents (so I could have had my driver’s license changed since the summer… *facepalm*). Next was the social security office, and they asked for the legal name change paperwork, my new birth certificate, and my ID. That also went over very smoothly.

At the end of December, I decided to go and see my old Endocrinologist to see if there was anything they could do for me. I spoke to my doctor, told him that I have GID and that I wanted to start hormonal therapy, and if he knew of any place that I could go to because my insurance wouldn’t pay for it. My doctor said that they could take care of me, and that he actually had a few other patients who were trans that were being treated there. I was so relieved, and made an appointment for blood work, and then an injection. 

Although I pay out of pockets, my injections are kept off of the record from my insurance company and I have a $12 copay to have actual doctor visits. My injections are $39 per injection, but most of the price is a fee to have a nurse administer the injection (required by my Endocrinologist because of their company policy, it may be different for you). I get these twice a month and see my Endocrinologist once every 3-4 months.

My first injection was January 20th, 2012. Already having more testosterone than normal because of my POS, most of my changes happened quickly—within the first 3-5 months of being on testosterone. Some of the good things: my voice deepened pretty quickly, I noticed a steep increase in facial and body hair, and there’s definitely been an increase in libido, although I already had a pretty active sex drive before T. Some of the bad things: my acne got worse (again), and I get a lot more irritable and angry around injection time. 

Here’s a sample of how much my voice has changed (Sorry for the quality of the first one):

Here’s an example of my facial hair. I trimmed recently, so it usually looks fuller than this.

I want to be pretty. Now, coming from a male that is 190 lbs, 5'10"", and built like a fucking viking, a statement like that might seem a bit odd, or silly. But it's how I feel: I want to be pretty, I want to *feel* pretty. Let me explain. 

Firstly, I am somebody who is masculine for the most part, I like sports and guns, I listen to and make loud and obnoxius music, etc. I am a stereotypical male in many respects. But I am also not stereotypical in other respects. So I wouldn't necessarily want to betray a side of me that is very real by dressing/behaving/generally being something other than that.

However, I have no desire to act like a female either. I don't want to drag. I don't really want to wear makeup (though my understanding of cosmetics and their power over human image is shoddy at best (remember the part where I'm a stereotypical guy?)), nor do I want to wear women's clothing or act like a female. I just want to feel like I'm one.

What I mean is, I want to be a guy, but I don't want to be handsome. I don't want to be suave or dapper or anything like it. I want to be a guy, but I want to be pretty.

SO, my question after all that is this: Firstly, is this a genderqueer type of feeling, and if so, can any of you offer me any advice? If it is not, can you identify what this feeling is, and direct me to something/one/place that could help me?

**EDIT:** ok so it's genderqueer. K. Now, can any of you help me with how I should act on these feelings?

Now, coming from a male that is 190 lbs, 5\'10"", and built like a fucking viking, a statement like that might seem a bit odd, or silly. But it\'s how I feel: I want to be pretty, I want to *feel* pretty. Let me explain. \n\nFirstly, I am somebody who is masculine for the most part, I like sports and guns, I listen to and make loud and obnoxius music, etc. I am a stereotypical male in many respects. But I am also not stereotypical in other respects. So I wouldn\'t necessarily want to betray a side of me that is very real by dressing/behaving/generally being something other than that.\n\nHowever, I have no desire to act like a female either. I don\'t want to drag. I don\'t really want to wear makeup (though my understanding of cosmetics and their power over human image is shoddy at best (remember the part where I\'m a stereotypical guy?)), nor do I want to wear women\'s clothing or act like a female. I just want to feel like I\'m one.\n\nWhat I mean is, I want to be a guy, but I don\'t want to be handsome. I don\'t want to be suave or dapper or anything like it. I want to be a guy, but I want to be pretty.\n\nSO, my question after all that is this: Firstly, is this a genderqueer type of feeling, and if so, can any of you offer me any advice? If it is not, can you identify what this feeling is, and direct me to something/one/place that could help me?\n\n**EDIT:** ok so it\'s genderqueer. K. Now, can any of you help me with how I should act on these feelings?

I'm FAAB, and present as female, but not...""feminine"". I wear jeans and sneakers and hoodies, don't wear makeup, don't shave body hair, and cut my hair myself whenever it gets long enough to annoy me (shoulder-lengthish). I do not wear dresses, I do not wear skirts, and when I was made to as a kid there was massive dysphoria. I'm okay with my body, but personalitywise I feel a lot more male than female. I identify variously as ""tomboy"", ""genderqueer"", and ""who the fuck knows this is too complicated lets just go do something else before I start feeling bad about myself"".

There is a ""white tie optional"" event later this year. Usually I would avoid this like the plague, but all my friends are going and I want to go, and I shouldn't have to miss out. Which has meant months (so far) of tears and stress agonizing over what to do. After some begging from my friends, I agreed to come, which now means I have to deal with the whole fucking clothing saga again. I just want to have a good evening with my friends, wearing clothing I feel comfortable in that doesn't attract attention to me.

So far my suggested options are:

1. Don't go. This is my usual choice. It feels wrong that I should have to be excluded from this event because of being bad at gendernorms, and I won't get another chance.

2. Wear a dress. NO. NO. This will not happen, however supportive my female friends mean to be when they offer to help me shop for one.

3. Wear a tux, like the guys. I'm worried this would attract attention. I am out as bisexual, so maybe my friends would just think it was me being weird like that, but I don't think I could handle strangers staring at me. Apart from being terrified of this attention though, I would be comfortable with the clothing itself.

I wear jeans and sneakers and hoodies, don\'t wear makeup, don\'t shave body hair, and cut my hair myself whenever it gets long enough to annoy me (shoulder-lengthish). I do not wear dresses, I do not wear skirts, and when I was made to as a kid there was massive dysphoria. I\'m okay with my body, but personalitywise I feel a lot more male than female.

She is also reading it currently and so far finds it interesting.  I asked her if it covered any transgender issues relating to the Bible, and she mentioned something about how he used LGBT a lot in the book, but as we all know, LGBT does not always include the T.  I was wondering if anyone had read this book and could clue me in on if it did cover transgender issues, because if my mom could be swayed with a religious argument, it would make my life a hell of a lot easier coming out to her.  Although either way, this is very good news, because she currently doesn't believe that being gay is morally okay, and at least she is taking a second look for the better, and I am so excited I'm about to cry right now.

My dad still thinks that being gay or trans is morally wrong, but my mom getting this book did open up an opportunity for a conversation with my dad, and he basically believes he should keep his opinions to himself and that his children will lead their lives differently than how he believes they should, and that it's our lives and our right to do so and he's okay with that.

As I've gotten older interacting with women has become more and more complicated because I don't understand most of them the way people seem to expect I should. I prefer to be around men most of the time since we share a lot of the same interest and for the most part can get along much more easily. Problem is, my having a female body seems to get in the way of us being friends and me being able to just be one of the boys. They see me as a woman, no matter what I do, and there's often this weird sexual tension on their end that they express awkwardly and I wind up not being able to be their platonic friend and more of that friend they not so secretly want to hook up with. They don't treat me the same way as they do their guy friends, and it gets so frustrating I often have to end the friendship. 

I have never much liked my body because I always felt it restricted me socially. I don't feel like I'm a woman, though I don't really feel like I'm a man. I feel like I culturally fit what's perceived as masculine in my culture when it comes to a lot of I do mentally, but in some cases I find I can enjoy more culturally considered feminine things. 
  I strongly believe most of these behaviors are just behaviors and have no real gender, but they have labeled by American culture as gendered behaviors. When I ponder what gender I am, I feel neutral about it most of the time. The only time I feel female is when I'm talking to people about sexual experiences, since a lot of women and I have similar experiences due to our shared anatomy. 

I found out about gender neutral pronouns, I'm sure some of you have heard of them. Ze instead of he or she and hir instead of her or him. I like this idea, and am completely on board with it. I tried to get my partner (who adamantly prefers the term boyfriend for himself and girlfriend for me) to start using gender neutrals when referring to me, but he says he can't do that. He is a heterosexual cisgendered male, but he isn't some villain as some LGBT people make him out to be. He accepts my bisexuality, something other men could only do in theory but not in practice. He has been here for me through a lot of things and despite having challenges we've made it to almost the two year mark. We rarely fight because we're mentally in sync most the time and when we do argue, we work it out right then and there. This is a person who loves me for all those quirks and oddities I have. He knows I'm never going to be a traditional female and he loves me for it. 
 That being said, I'm afraid this might be too much for him. He will never be able to use gender neutral pronouns, he will never be able to not view me as female on some level because of his...how did he put this...having sex with me? I can't word it right. The general idea is there. 
I tried taking on an androgynous style of dress, and he was uncomfortable with it. I had felt good about it, but then he acted awkward and made jokes and it made me feel unsure and gave up on it. (He was more supportive of me not shaving than this oddly enough.)

137,2013-01-31 21:44:06,17njyd,1,4,"Note: sorry for the long text, and this is a throw-away account.

I think I'm genderqueer. I know my body doesn't suit my true identification. Where do I go from there?

I have a lot of sexual strugles and issues. I was raised as an androgynous tomboy girl in a shitty backward conservative poop hole. With people denying my birth assigned gender, accusing me of being gay or a guy and invalidating me, all of that forced me into a whole struggle to fit the gender status quo: dating guys to prove I'm not gay and an actual girl etc. This, without a doubt, fucked me up deeply. Years of therapy + pschotherapy + suicidal tendencies + very low self esteem and self loath after sex confirms this.

I just got out of a cis heterosexual relationship and came out to my parents (who totally ignored the issue) that I'm possibly gay and want to start dating girls. I'm currently dating a lovely trans woman, my first gay experience, and have been tagging a long with her in the community. I've been learning a lot and been trying to finally find an identity.

I dont want to be labeled something else than a woman. I struggled a lot to accept this for years and years. Revoking this would shatter my world. I dont want to eliminate it. But I'm also aware that I dislike female pronouns in a way. I feel like I'm being sexualized. (surprise surprise...) I've been trying to experience with different pronouns but I fail at keeping up. The male one did not work with me at all. I use the gender neutral ones without even noticing sometimes.

As far as sexuality go, do genderqueers experience hate towards their genitals? does anyone experience deep self loath after sex? even though I wanted to do it and I'm horny, sometimes i can feel a crisis coming and I really have to stop myself from actually doing it so I dont break down and cry my eyes out during sex and run into the shower.

I dislike the look of penises but I guess they feel good inside of me in a horrific shameful way. I'm ashamed. Deeply. I feel dominated with penetration and I hate it. Seeing semen dripping down on my thighs made me want to barf. And I cant believe I put up with this shit just cause ""all women do it"". Accepting my woman hood was always some sort of a ""giving in to the bullies"" feeling. I want to change. I want to liberate myself. I'm tired of this. I want sex to feel good without guilt and shame.

Often, I wish I could be asexual and agender in a way. I've looked up hysterectomy, and the idea of cutting my genitals and sexual parts is infact appealing to me. I've also looked up chemical castration. Infact, I enjoy my ssri for that benefit mostly.

As far as clothing goes, I've been experiencing with more feminine clothing recently when I feel happy. However, on an everyday basis, I aim for the androgynous / butch /edgy type of look even though I look quiet feminine now with long hair.

Any guidance, comments, anything, especially some mirroring and validation will be deeply appreciated.

A few nights ago I was waiting in line for the bathroom at Smart Bar, Chicago. While I’m still nervous about using the women’s bathroom, I was especially so this time. It’s not that I thought Smart Bar attracts a particularly trans unfriendly crowd, instead there were two very specific reasons for this nervousness. One, I knew the lights in the men’s bathroom were pretty bright and figured the women’s bathroom would be bright as well; and two, the line was realllly long. To me, bright lights plus lots of people equals a greater chance of being read. Another *teensy* factor may have been that I was high as hell and sorta tweaking out.
 
So far the line is still in the main area of the club and it’s pretty dark. I look around at my fellow women to try and gauge their potential trans-friendliness: *She looks pretty alt, that’s good. Eh, she kinda looks like a bitch- try not to let her notice you. She’s a talker, stay away from her or she’ll try to talk to YOU*. I accidentally make eye contact with a girl and give her a weak smile; she smiles back. So far so good! The line begins to move and we head through the door into the bathroom. Actually, it’s more accurately described as a waiting room with couches and a bunch of mirrors and OH GOD THOSE LIGHTS. I grimace and see my face reflected multiple times in the mirrors. Great, a few more ways for people to stare at me!

Inside I immediately notice the social situation is much different than the men’s room. For starters, there are girls just hanging out. Talking, laughing, texting, just chillin on the countertops like it’s no big deal. Casual conversations are initiated with phrases like “I like your top” and friends talk to each other through the stalls. There’s a girl passed out on a plush bench-thing and her friend sits next to her stroking her hair. A few minutes later a bouncer would come in and check-in on passed out-girl. After she woke her up, passed out-girl assured her everything was cool then some rando started taking pictures with her. It was REALLY. WEIRD.

Through all of this I am standing somewhere in the middle of the line losing my mind.  Here I am with twenty-two years of awkward male socializing, a dick crammed somewhere in my dress, I’m stoned in the most feminine place possible, and I’m feeling pretty out of place. The line doesn’t run along a wall so we are standing out in the open, exposed for everyone to look at. I try and play it cool by pretending to be extremely interested in my phone while praying that no one tries to talk to me. As far as I can tell no one seems to be staring at me, but I also don’t want to invite any attention by gawking around like a fool. Eventually, since it seems like the right thing to do, I turn to look at myself in the mirror. Instead of myself, however, I see a quasi-feminine person with too much eyeliner starting back.
 
*Jeez, they’ll let anybody into the women’s bathroom these days*, I say to the Stranger. But looking longer, I decide this is not someone who appears completely out of place. *Appears out of place* is the right phrase, though, as they are not all that they seem. *On the contrary!* The Stranger says to me, *YOU are the wolf. You are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Just last month you were here and you were using the other bathroom. Your friends sometimes call you “Nathan” even when you are wearing a dress*. I quickly turn away from the mirror and look around the bathroom all shify-eyed, making sure no one is reading my mind. It doesn’t look like anybody is so I turn back to the mirror. *That’s not true!* I think-yell at the stranger, *I am just as much myself no matter what bathroom I use. In fact, I am quite sure who I am but I’m not too sure who you are.* I look hard at the reflection and slowly the threads of similarity begin to tie together. The nose, the eyes, the whole face! It’s mine! It is not the Stranger who is the reflection, but me! Upon realizing this our worlds reverse and I am transported into the mirror, enabling me to view the Stranger who was actually standing in line. You see, the frightened person waiting in line was not me; instead I am the person reflected in the mirror who belongs in the women’s bathroom. The excessive eyeliner, the hair, the soft features, the dress, the breasts, the penis- YES, EVEN THE PENIS- they are all mine. I’m just not used to them!

During my existential crisis the line has moved forward and I am first in line for the toilets. But I’m not afraid; I’m an empowered quasi-female looking person who belongs in the women’s bathrooms! A stall opens up and I willing step forward, eager to sit upon my righteous spot. I hike up the dress, drop the panties, take a seat, turn my feet at an inward angle, and pee right into that fucking toilet. And when I’m done I grab some toilet paper and wipe off that dick because I’m a female goddamnit!! 

The entire experience was easily the most excitement I’ve ever had in a bathroom. But more than that, it was about overcoming fear. We live in a very gendered society and bathrooms represent the pinnacle of that division. Due to the strict gender rules surrounding them, bathrooms can be very continuous places for transpeople who just want to do their business in peace (or have existential crises).

",transgender,In Sheep's Clothing,1357303498.0,"{'created_utc': 1357278298, 'id': '15xpme', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '(This is a story/essay I wrote that I wanted to share. Not sure where to put it so here it is! Hope you like it!)\n\nA few nights ago I was waiting in line for the bathroom at Smart Bar, Chicago. While I’m still nervous about using the women’s bathroom, I was especially so this time. It’s not that I thought Smart Bar attracts a particularly trans unfriendly crowd, instead there were two very specific reasons for this nervousness. One, I knew the lights in the men’s bathroom were pretty bright and figured the women’s bathroom would be bright as well; and two, the line was realllly long. To me, bright lights plus lots of people equals a greater chance of being read. Another *teensy* factor may have been that I was high as hell and sorta tweaking out.\n \nSo far the line is still in the main area of the club and it’s pretty dark. I look around at my fellow women to try and gauge their potential trans-friendliness: *She looks pretty alt, that’s good. Eh, she kinda looks like a bitch- try not to let her notice you. She’s a talker, stay away from her or she’ll try to talk to YOU*. I accidentally make eye contact with a girl and give her a weak smile; she smiles back. So far so good! The line begins to move and we head through the door into the bathroom. Actually, it’s more accurately described as a waiting room with couches and a bunch of mirrors and OH GOD THOSE LIGHTS. I grimace and see my face reflected multiple times in the mirrors. Great, a few more ways for people to stare at me!\n\nInside I immediately notice the social situation is much different than the men’s room. For starters, there are girls just hanging out. Talking, laughing, texting, just chillin on the countertops like it’s no big deal. Casual conversations are initiated with phrases like “I like your top” and friends talk to each other through the stalls. There’s a girl passed out on a plush bench-thing and her friend sits next to her stroking her hair. A few minutes later a bouncer would come in and check-in on passed out-girl. After she woke her up, passed out-girl assured her everything was cool then some rando started taking pictures with her. It was REALLY. WEIRD.\n\nThrough all of this I am standing somewhere in the middle of the line losing my mind.  Here I am with twenty-two years of awkward male socializing, a dick crammed somewhere in my dress, I’m stoned in the most feminine place possible, and I’m feeling pretty out of place. The line doesn’t run along a wall so we are standing out in the open, exposed for everyone to look at. I try and play it cool by pretending to be extremely interested in my phone while praying that no one tries to talk to me. As far as I can tell no one seems to be staring at me, but I also don’t want to invite any attention by gawking around like a fool. Eventually, since it seems like the right thing to do, I turn to look at myself in the mirror. Instead of myself, however, I see a quasi-feminine person with too much eyeliner starting back.\n \n*Jeez, they’ll let anybody into the women’s bathroom these days*, I say to the Stranger. But looking longer, I decide this is not someone who appears completely out of place. *Appears out of place* is the right phrase, though, as they are not all that they seem. *On the contrary!* The Stranger says to me, *YOU are the wolf. You are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Just last month you were here and you were using the other bathroom. Your friends sometimes call you “Nathan” even when you are wearing a dress*. I quickly turn away from the mirror and look around the bathroom all shify-eyed, making sure no one is reading my mind. It doesn’t look like anybody is so I turn back to the mirror. *That’s not true!* I think-yell at the stranger, *I am just as much myself no matter what bathroom I use. In fact, I am quite sure who I am but I’m not too sure who you are.* I look hard at the reflection and slowly the threads of similarity begin to tie together. The nose, the eyes, the whole face! It’s mine! It is not the Stranger who is the reflection, but me! Upon realizing this our worlds reverse and I am transported into the mirror, enabling me to view the Stranger who was actually standing in line. You see, the frightened person waiting in line was not me; instead I am the person reflected in the mirror who belongs in the women’s bathroom. The excessive eyeliner, the hair, the soft features, the dress, the breasts, the penis- YES, EVEN THE PENIS- they are all mine. I’m just not used to them!\n\nDuring my existential crisis the line has moved forward and I am first in line for the toilets. But I’m not afraid; I’m an empowered quasi-female looking person who belongs in the women’s bathrooms! A stall opens up and I willing step forward, eager to sit upon my righteous spot. I hike up the dress, drop the panties, take a seat, turn my feet at an inward angle, and pee right into that fucking toilet. And when I’m done I grab some toilet paper and wipe off that dick because I’m a female goddamnit!! \n\nThe entire experience was easily the most excitement I’ve ever had in a bathroom. But more than that, it was about overcoming fear. We live in a very gendered society and bathrooms represent the pinnacle of that division. Due to the strict gender rules surrounding them, bathrooms can be very continuous places for transpeople who just want to do their business in peace (or have existential crises).

55,2013-01-07 19:18:27,164ufj,0,1,"Around age 8 I started dreaming about being a girl. Constantly. I came up with so many plots that resulted in my feminization, from magic, to the work of god, to magical chemicals (I nearly got that one right), to random happenstance. I started cross-dressing around age 12. Without a sister of similar size, I got by stealing clothes from my mother, and fashioning clothes from scraps and ill fitting garments I already owned. When I realized that this was not a unique affliction, I was filled with conflicting feelings about what I should do. “Am I transgender?” I asked myself, “Am I just a boy who likes women’s clothes? Am I gay?” Eventually, I decided to repress these feelings. Full of self hate, and hiding this huge burden I carried, I slid by. I still cross-dressed fairly regularly, even after my little brother found my stash, and I had to throw it out (He didn’t realize what he had found, and my mother never saw the trash bag I smuggled it out it [Honestly, this happened quite a few times, and I’m surprised my family never caught on]). Throughout high school I was miserable, got bad grades, and was perpetually distracted; lost in daydreams of happiness. I started seeing a psychologist for Social Anxiety, and that helped, until college. I started strong, but promptly fell into my old ways, and as the year came to a close, I found myself one again excited to go home and have my brief moments of peace. In July, I had a breakdown, and realized how unhappy I was, and went to reddit looking for a solution. At first I thought I was bigender (I didn’t want to be a girl all the time, just some of it), but I soon realized that wasn’t true; I want, need, to be a girl. I bought a new stash of feminine apparel, and spent my last month at home in girl-mode as often as I could. Eventually, I came out to my psychologist, and tried to work through some of my issues with him, but didn’t really get anywhere before summer’s end. When school began anew, I was miserable once more. Stricken by my old anxiety, and a new depression, I fell apart, failed two classes, and drifted away from a close friend. Now, as I start anti-anxiety/depressants, and face a new semester, I realize that I need to move forward, both in my studies, and my knowledge of myself, that brings us to today.

My conundrums:

**1:** I need to come out at some point, and that scares the crap out of me, even though it shouldn’t (In my case). My Mother is very supportive, very pro-lgbt, and a generally pleasant person. My father will come to accept it; he’s never been prone to bigotry, and I don’t see that changing. That said, I’m scared of what will happen to them if and when I do come out. My mom is prone to depression, and easily stressed, and I don’t want to add to her impending total freakout. My dad has given up a lot for our family, and has always expected me to be just as traditionally masculine as he is (I’ve already disappointed him on that front), and I feel like coming out would just be a slap in the face to him. In my more expended family (We often get together in groups of 30+), I don’t know how people will react (I expect well, considering how the reacted to my cousins who are gay, and their various partners [whom I tend to like more than the cousins themselves]).

**1a** : Coming out to friends is another issue. I really have 3 close friends, and maybe half a dozen close acquaintances. I’ll focus on friends. 

**1a^a** : My closest friend I met in middle school. I hated him when we met initially, but after standing up for him when a good friend at the time was giving him shit, we became friends. We’ve been there for each other through a lot (Although not in an emotional sense, really). He’s transphobic. I’m not sure how severely, but the sort of person who has on more than one occasion gone on a tirade about how he “can’t imagine why someone would mutilate their own body like that.” This is concerning.

**1a^b** : My next closest friend goes to school with me, and I met last year after being locked out of my room. He’s an odd fellow, but one of the most generally pleasant people I’ve ever met (friend a^a has a personality best described as “abrasive”). That said, Friend a^b presents a different sort of issue: he’s gay, and crushing hard over guy mode me. This isn’t speculation, he’s said it outright. While I’m sure he’ll be supportive, I know that my coming out will cause him a great deal of stress, and I can’t get rid of the idea that he’s only my friend out of some hope that I’ll realize I’m gay and fall for him (This is unlikely, and irrational, I know, but I can’t shake the idea).

**1a^c** : Finally, we reach my freshman roommate. We were good friends last year, but drifted apart somewhat over the last semester. He was raised religiously and still holds on to some of that. He sometimes falls into old habits, and manners of speech (He’s a big one for using gay as a pejorative, always apologising for it, but saying it accidentally nonetheless). Last year we talked about living with each other next year, when we would have enough credits to live in the swanky off-campus housing owned by the school. I’m afraid of losing him as a friend, and as a potential housemate in the future, even though that ship may have already sailed.

**1a^addendum** : Depending on the timetable on which things happen, I may have to come out to my current roommate. He’s a very religious fellow, and we have few similar interests, but we get along fine enough to peacefully cohabitate for the moment. I've always resent him though, because he’s the reason I can’t get away with dressing frequently, shaving my legs, etc. He’s just clever enough to notice that sort of thing, and I don’t want to deal with being forced to explain before I’m ready.

**2** : More importantly, I need to figure out whether I need to transition. I think I do, but at the same time, when pressured to explain why, I always fall apart. I’ve got a lot of confusion and trepidation and anxiety floating around, and my inability to put my feelings into concise explanations only makes this worse. Added to that, my psychologist doesn't specialize in trans issues, and as such doesn't seem to know what we’re doing (He’s helped me a lot, but we both recognize that I need to see a specialist, the problem is getting to the point that I’m comfortable in doing that). 

**3** : Now  for a break from heavy stuff for a question: would it be weird to keep my current name? Not my full name, of course, that reeks of masculinity, but rather the name I go by day-to-day (I’m nervous to put it here, because I’m not out, and it links back to me, but it’s AJ). It doesn't really carry any strong gender connotation, and I’ve found quite a few women who use the name. Would that be weird?

**4** : Overall, I just want to that everyone in the reddit LGBT, and especially trans* community, for helping me get to the place I am now. This time last year, I was prepared to live my miserable little life a guy. I was ready to coast through life, working jobs that I would hate, and living a life that wasn't my own, but now I’m able to see that there might just be a light at the end of the tunnel.

TL;DR: Various anxieties, various troubles, don't know what I'm doing, etc, etc.

Constantly. I came up with so many plots that resulted in my feminization, from magic, to the work of god, to magical chemicals (I nearly got that one right), to random happenstance. I started cross-dressing around age 12. Without a sister of similar size, I got by stealing clothes from my mother, and fashioning clothes from scraps and ill fitting garments I already owned. When I realized that this was not a unique affliction, I was filled with conflicting feelings about what I should do. “Am I transgender?” I asked myself, “Am I just a boy who likes women’s clothes? Am I gay?” Eventually, I decided to repress these feelings. Full of self hate, and hiding this huge burden I carried, I slid by. I still cross-dressed fairly regularly, even after my little brother found my stash, and I had to throw it out (He didn’t realize what he had found, and my mother never saw the trash bag I smuggled it out it [Honestly, this happened quite a few times, and I’m surprised my family never caught on]). Throughout high school I was miserable, got bad grades, and was perpetually distracted; lost in daydreams of happiness. I started seeing a psychologist for Social Anxiety, and that helped, until college. I started strong, but promptly fell into my old ways, and as the year came to a close, I found myself one again excited to go home and have my brief moments of peace. In July, I had a breakdown, and realized how unhappy I was, and went to reddit looking for a solution. At first I thought I was bigender (I didn’t want to be a girl all the time, just some of it), but I soon realized that wasn’t true; I want, need, to be a girl. I bought a new stash of feminine apparel, and spent my last month at home in girl-mode as often as I could. Eventually, I came out to my psychologist, and tried to work through some of my issues with him, but didn’t really get anywhere before summer’s end. When school began anew, I was miserable once more. Stricken by my old anxiety, and a new depression, I fell apart, failed two classes, and drifted away from a close friend. Now, as I start anti-anxiety/depressants, and face a new semester, I realize that I need to move forward, both in my studies, and my knowledge of myself, that brings us to today.\n\nMy conundrums:\n\n**1:** I need to come out at some point, and that scares the crap out of me, even though it shouldn’t (In my case). My Mother is very supportive, very pro-lgbt, and a generally pleasant person. My father will come to accept it; he’s never been prone to bigotry, and I don’t see that changing. That said, I’m scared of what will happen to them if and when I do come out. My mom is prone to depression, and easily stressed, and I don’t want to add to her impending total freakout. My dad has given up a lot for our family, and has always expected me to be just as traditionally masculine as he is (I’ve already disappointed him on that front), and I feel like coming out would just be a slap in the face to him. In my more expended family (We often get together in groups of 30+), I don’t know how people will react (I expect well, considering how the reacted to my cousins who are gay, and their various partners [whom I tend to like more than the cousins themselves]).\n\n**1a** : Coming out to friends is another issue. I really have 3 close friends, and maybe half a dozen close acquaintances. I’ll focus on friends. \n\n**1a^a** : My closest friend I met in middle school. I hated him when we met initially, but after standing up for him when a good friend at the time was giving him shit, we became friends. We’ve been there for each other through a lot (Although not in an emotional sense, really). He’s transphobic. I’m not sure how severely, but the sort of person who has on more than one occasion gone on a tirade about how he “can’t imagine why someone would mutilate their own body like that.” This is concerning.\n\n**1a^b** : My next closest friend goes to school with me, and I met last year after being locked out of my room. He’s an odd fellow, but one of the most generally pleasant people I’ve ever met (friend a^a has a personality best described as “abrasive”). That said, Friend a^b presents a different sort of issue: he’s gay, and crushing hard over guy mode me. This isn’t speculation, he’s said it outright. While I’m sure he’ll be supportive, I know that my coming out will cause him a great deal of stress, and I can’t get rid of the idea that he’s only my friend out of some hope that I’ll realize I’m gay and fall for him (This is unlikely, and irrational, I know, but I can’t shake the idea).\n\n**1a^c** : Finally, we reach my freshman roommate. We were good friends last year, but drifted apart somewhat over the last semester. He was raised religiously and still holds on to some of that. He sometimes falls into old habits, and manners of speech (He’s a big one for using gay as a pejorative, always apologising for it, but saying it accidentally nonetheless). Last year we talked about living with each other next year, when we would have enough credits to live in the swanky off-campus housing owned by the school. I’m afraid of losing him as a friend, and as a potential housemate in the future, even though that ship may have already sailed.\n\n**1a^addendum** : Depending on the timetable on which things happen, I may have to come out to my current roommate. He’s a very religious fellow, and we have few similar interests, but we get along fine enough to peacefully cohabitate for the moment. I\'ve always resent him though, because he’s the reason I can’t get away with dressing frequently, shaving my legs, etc. He’s just clever enough to notice that sort of thing, and I don’t want to deal with being forced to explain before I’m ready.\n\n**2** : More importantly, I need to figure out whether I need to transition. I think I do, but at the same time, when pressured to explain why, I always fall apart. I’ve got a lot of confusion and trepidation and anxiety floating around, and my inability to put my feelings into concise explanations only makes this worse. Added to that, my psychologist doesn\'t specialize in trans issues, and as such doesn\'t seem to know what we’re doing (He’s helped me a lot, but we both recognize that I need to see a specialist, the problem is getting to the point that I’m comfortable in doing that). \n\n**3** : Now  for a break from heavy stuff for a question: would it be weird to keep my current name? Not my full name, of course, that reeks of masculinity, but rather the name I go by day-to-day (I’m nervous to put it here, because I’m not out, and it links back to me, but it’s AJ). It doesn\'t really carry any strong gender connotation, and I’ve found quite a few women who use the name. Would that be weird?\n\n**4** : Overall, I just want to that everyone in the reddit LGBT, and especially trans* community, for helping me get to the place I am now. This time last year, I was prepared to live my miserable little life a guy. I was ready to coast through life, working jobs that I would hate, and living a life that wasn\'t my own, but now I’m able to see that there might just be a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nTL;DR: Various anxieties, various troubles, don\'t know what I\'m doing, etc, etc.\n\nEDIT: this isn\'t really a rant so much as a ""My brain is full of stuff and I need to dump it somewhere""-thing.

I'm (relatively) recently out as trans to friends and family and have started taking steps along my journey. The next mile-stone is in a couple of weeks (23rd!), my first meeting with the local mental health authority (following a referral from a pretty clueless GP). As it approaches, I'm getting quite apprehensive and am starting to fixate on and stress over it. As such, I was hoping that some of you lovely people would be able to help and advice on what to expect, what things/questions are likely to come up etc. and is there anything I should do to 'prepare' etc.?

I've been stressing and worried over it for the past few days, and don't see myself calming down anytime soon :p.
I do know that it's ""nothing to worry about"" and to just ""speak your mind and say what you feel"", but there are a number of things I can't help but worry over. Firstly, are pre-existing (or evidence thereof) mental-health/behavioral issues likely to 'count against' me/be an obstacle of my transition? 
Am I expected to go 'dressed'?

Is there an element of testing/pass-fail to this or further meetings? I.e. if I give a 'wrong' answer etc. (wrong way of putting it, I know, but I hope you get my point) is it possible for the councilor to send me home with a blunt 'no, you're not trans. Stop trying'? 

And is there anything you'd suggest not mentioning, or which is likely to 'count against' me should it come up (generally speaking, obviously you don't know the details of my personal life)?

Thanks again, for this and all the other help I've taken from reading here.

That being said, I think it's also *very* important to ensure that those observing from the outside are not deterred from getting the treatment they need due to what *may* (I dunno, I could be lucky?) be isolated incidents. 

I think the most important thing to remember is that your doctor is only human. As with all humans, some can be assholes and it's important to stand up to those kind of people. Others are simply uninformed and require assistance in helping you. Remember, guidelines state that treatment should be **patient-led**. Remind him of this. In any case, you have a right to proper treatment and a right to demand to see a more competent doctor if need be. I had to see my GP this morning after my psych evaluation and blood tests. My end goal was to come away with a referral to a GIC (Gender Identity Clinic), even though I know the waiting times for those places are pretty lengthy. That being said, I only started this whole process around three months ago (and yes, I'm kicking myself that I didn't start it earlier) so I'm pleased to be this far along already.

My GP this morning confessed to having absolutely no idea what terminology to use or what to expect out of the whole process.

I'd done my research, that I'm in a stable frame of mind and that I was serious**. It's the third time I've given a medical professional these documents and each time was met with enthusiasm. 

We had a frank and open discussion which helped us both enormously. I explained how dysphoria makes me feel, that I'm worried about the ongoing effects of testosterone and that, while I don't care too much about genital dysphoria, body hair is a serious issue for me. I hate it. I also explained that I'm worried about testosterone clouding judgement (how many of you have asked yourself whether it's ""just a fetish""?) and that I could seriously do with getting on hormones quickly. Not only that, but it could save the Primary Care Trust a whole heap of money if I decide that this isn't the right path for me *before* I get to the GIC -- he agreed, and I came away with not only my referral to the GIC but also a referral to an endocrinologist at the local hospital AND he's looking into PCT funding for laser hair removal.

129,2013-01-13 06:42:46,16hc56,7,11,"It was requested elsewhere on reddit that I give my personal encounters with transphobia. As some background, I'm a student at a small private university in California, in the United States. The university has 4 stars for gender identity protections from campus climate, and just last semester a student group regarding transgender/genderqueer issues was formed. They found a massive amount of challenges starting almost instantly, and a good portion of those were because of me. To my knowledge I am the only transwoman on campus, as all the other members of the group are cis allies of FAAB. On November 23 a smaller version of this story was presented in the campus dining hall as part of the ""Share your Story"" event by the feminist organization on campus. That version had no descriptions of the campus and used some placenames that would not be comprehensible to anyone not familiar with the campus. Furthermore that version only contain the first two paragraphs, the descriptions of what happened on October 15,29, and November 8, and the last paragraph. The story contains direct quotes from some rather hateful people, with any slurs being uncensored, and so the whole story comes with a massive trigger warning:

I'm just the girl with green eyes. I don't understand why everyone
around me gives me these strange stares, like I somehow shouldn't be
here. I can't even leave my dorm without someone thinking i'm
some kind of freak.

Its not just stares. People call me 'fag', 'shemale', 'he-she' and the
like. Just because I look like a boy doesn't mean I am one! I don't
like it, and I'm working to change it. But for now, I still feel
threatened unless I try to be someone I'm not.

Its been going on for almost three months now. It started on October
8. I was going to a meeting of the university's transgender student
group, which was of course in our campus LGBT center. Here, we have
some magnetic words on our filing cabinet which people can arrange
into statements like ""trans women are women"", ""queer love is hard
love"", ""I hide because people discriminate"", ""gender is sex fag"" or
""men dress like women and they are fags"". I'm certain the last two
weren't what the magnets were supposed to be used for. We fixed the
two problem statements, though were somewhat worried.

On October 15, I was just walking across the University center lawn,
in disguise of course. I gave no hints that I was a girl. And yet,
someone on the other end of the lawn yelled ""Hey, it's that shemale!""
at me. I turned to look at them, and they responded with ""Oh, it's
looking at us!"" She! She's looking at us!

The next day was the beginning of spirit week. I was going to the same
LGBT center to see what to do regarding what happened yesterday, and
as my friends and I were looking into what to do, we noticed something
odd on the filing cabinet. ""A trans girl is a he she"". That really
shouldn't be there. So we removed it and prepared for spirit day. We
stood against bullying, and a quarter of the school was in purple.

But it didn't end there. Two weeks later on October 29, I went out
without a disguise.  I was at the University Center, and those same
people were there. I could tell by their voices. They were
laughing. Laughing at me, as if I were a circus clown. Did nobody
think anything of this?  Are they all that mean?

Perhaps they are. On November 5, I was going to another meeting of the
university's trans group. I felt no need to disguise myself for a
trans group meeting. The problem is that to get there from where I
live, I have to walk across an open field, on a brightly lit
path. There was a club soccer game being played in that field, and
some of the athletes on the bench noticed that I don't look like a
normal girl. Their reaction to this was to point and laugh.

More recently, on November 8, I was just walking to my car to meet
some friends. I don't need to hide who I am around my friends, do I?
But it was not my friends who first saw me. No, it was them. The same
people who cause all those problems for me in October. They pulled
into the parking lot just as I walked out the door of my dorm. One of
them said ""What the hell is that thing?"". Then another said something
I really couldn't understand. It must have been really funny, because
they all burst out laughing. It must have been so funny that they
forgot to stop pointing at me.

But it still wasn't over. Even though I should have learned that by
this point I can't go out without a VERY good disguise, even if I'm
going someplace accepting, I hadn't. So, on November 20, I went out
across that field, and there were some people coming back. As we
passed in the field, I heard one of them say ""I wonder where she was
going all dressed up like that"". Hooray! Finally someone who sees me
for who I truly am. That happiness was crushed within seconds when the
other said ""That thing was a guy"". It got even worse when the first
responded by shouting ""WHAT THE FUCK?"". It somehow became worse still
when he did it again. And again.

Just a week later, I was again walking across the same field, for the
same reason, still without a disguise. Right next to that field are
tennis courts, and there were children's tennis lessons just ending at
the time. One of the parents saw me. She came up to me and told me not
""Recruit [her] child into the sinful gay lifestyle"". I ran. I didn't
stop until I was well away. But it was someone from outside, they
don't matter. I don't need tell anyone about what someone unimportant
said, do I?

December was winter break, so I could just hide in my room the entire
time. I can't be hurt there. At least, not yet anyway. January 7th is
when classes started up again, and just 2 days later I was headed out
to be with friends, still without any disguise. Again, someone saw me
and shouted ""WHAT THE FUCK?"". I'm not a freak! I'm just another girl
on campus. Why can noone see this?

This isn't even counting the number of times someone has called me a
freak or something like that under their breath, thinking I can't hear
them. And the real tragedy is, this story is not over. This is still
happening. I still feel threatened whenever anyone sees me. I can only
really feel safe if I know I can't be seen. So, there isn't a green
eyed girl here. She doesn't exist. She doesn't try to hide as a green
eyed boy. Everyone knows that.

For the longest time, I couldn't get around the notion that anyone who wouldn't accept me as a girl was immediately hostile and had excluded from my life. As I went on, I saw more and more people excluded from my life, including my parents, my sister, some of my closest friends, even an old teacher of mine. I didn't have a job, was homeless, and was totally obsessed with this one notion of being accepted as Lynn and not Stephen.

Then it hit me. Bones would identify me as a male, based upon my skeletal structure, and Hodgins would confirm it with a DNA sample. Even in death I wouldn't be accepted as a girl. A thousand years could pass and all I'd be is a checkmark labeled ""male"" on the death report.

I cried, not so much for the fact of the story I played in my head, but because I had let this one thing get to me - that not everyone was going to accept who I was and I was going to have to be ok with that, and that I was the one who had to adapt, and that me forcing my new identity down the throats of others was the source of all my angst.

I called up my parents a day or two later. Told them I needed help, and that I was ok if they didn't accept me as a girl, but that I was going to go on with taking hormones and that one day when I could I was going to complete my change - but all of that doesn't matter and you can call me Stephen for as long as you like.

263,2013-01-21 00:26:52,16yi6w,0,1,"Hey Reddit. Today, January 20th, marks my first year on testosterone. Today, I just wanted to share my story in hopes that it will help any of you get started on transitioning, or maybe give you some inspiration to keep transitioning, even if you don’t see the progress right away.


I first discovered that I had GID through my girlfriend (heterosexual female), after I confessed that I really liked her. Her initial response was that she couldn’t be with a lesbian, but after I told her that I felt more like a guy and that I didn’t consider myself gay, she started doing some research (having heard of GID on a television show a while back) and began sending me articles of the disorder. Reading those symptoms felt like reading out of a diary. It was a very conflicting moment in my life, because I was relieved that I knew what was “wrong” with me, but at the same time, I knew that I was going to start a very long journey to transition.
I’m 20 years old now, but I discovered this around the fall of 2007. At that time, and some time before that, I was seeing an endocrinologist for polycystic ovarian syndrome. They put me on birth control to fix my estrogen levels, but when I realized it was doing the opposite of what I wanted, I quit going there. I had just started high school and had no idea where to turn with this information. My step-father was in the military at the time, so we have military insurance(known for not being LGBT friendly). Our hospital was on a military base, so the awkwardness of going to the doctors while looking like a different gender was multiplied by the fact that it was a military hospital. 

The first person I told, my girlfriend aside, was my mother. My mom and I have always had a good relationship, and she has always been extremely supportive of me. She always assumed that I would be gay, because she noticed how tomboyish I was from an early age (didn’t like dolls, didn’t like girly clothes, and didn’t like long hair). She was very supportive and wanted to make sure that I knew what this entailed for me, and she also wanted me to know that even though she would support me, she and my step-father would be unable to do so financially in the long-run. 

I bided my time through highschool, unsure of exactly how to go about getting testosterone injections. I knew that in order to have surgery I needed to be diagnosed by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, so I told my mother that I wanted counseling. I was pretty depressed in middle school, and was getting extremely stressed out by trying to figure out what to do. I got permission to see a psychiatrist from my insurance, and when I explained everything to her, she told me that although she was very convinced that I had GID, we couldn’t put that down as the main reason for me seeing her, because my insurance didn’t cover it. We had to put depression. I stopped seeing her after a few months.

Time passed, I watched youtube videos and read a lot of forums on surgery types, costs, and different methods of hormonal treatment. As someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, my testosterone levels were already higher than normal, so I had more facial/body hair, and my voice was slightly lower than most girls. I passed pretty well as a male just from face-to-face interaction, but my voice and breasts were what really gave me away. My sophomore year, I started wearing a binder. It wasn’t the best, as I have really large breasts (thanks mom) but it was better than the sports bras I was wearing. I figured that my name change was what I needed to do next. This was difficult because I was born in Germany, on an American base, and any change to my birth certificate would have to be done through an American Consulate. 

My senior year, I shortened my name from “Brittany” to “Brit.” I told some of my closer friends what I intended to do, but I knew that even after changing my name and starting to transition, it would be difficult because I was going to go to college in the same town that I graduated, which many of my classmates did as well. The end of senior year was tough, because they separated gown colors by gender, and females were required to wear a dress or skirt underneath their gown. I spoke to a very nice vice-principal privately and told her about my disorder, but our principal wouldn’t allow me to wear male colors and sit with the guys. I would, however, be allowed to wear shorts under my gown, and my name would be announced as “Brit _____,” and not my girly full first and middle name. 

Immediately following my graduation (June of 2011) I started my name change. I found a local attorney and I dropped $600 to have my name legally changed. I then had to deal with the long wait of processing through the American consulate after sending them documents mid-July of 2011. I had to return my birth certificate (which was a replacement of my original certificate that had been lost during my parents’ divorce), send in the legal name change papers, and pay $50 dollars to have a new one made. After two months of waiting, I was informed I would need a signed document from a notary verifying that it was a replacement birth certificate. 

I included a request to have my gender marker changed, and explained my situation. I was emailed and informed that in order to have the gender marker changed, I would need “a notarized physician’s letter that documents subject’s sexual reconstructive surgery that includes the following:
&gt; * Medial license or certificate number

&gt; * Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate

&gt; * Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration number assigned to physician

&gt; * Language stating “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the forgoing is true and correct. 

I was happy to learn exactly what I would need to do so in the future. I received this letter at the end of October, and it was already halfway through my first college semester. My name was still Brittany. I went and spoke directly to an executive in admissions at my college, and explained the situation. I told her that I really wanted my name changed because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would take before I received the paperwork, and that I felt uncomfortable with my name in my classes. She was very nice about and said she would see what she could do. She ended up changing my name in the system, and said that I would need to turn in the necessary documents as soon as possible (i.e., new driver’s license, new social security card, and new birth certificate). 

December rolled around and I finally got the paperwork from the American Consulate. Changing my drivers license was very easy, but I was nervous because I had heard that a lot of trans get flak from people at the DMV. I thought I would need my new birth certificate, but I found out that all I really needed was my legal name change documents (so I could have had my driver’s license changed since the summer… *facepalm*). Next was the social security office, and they asked for the legal name change paperwork, my new birth certificate, and my ID. That also went over very smoothly.

At the end of December, I decided to go and see my old Endocrinologist to see if there was anything they could do for me. I spoke to my doctor, told him that I have GID and that I wanted to start hormonal therapy, and if he knew of any place that I could go to because my insurance wouldn’t pay for it. My doctor said that they could take care of me, and that he actually had a few other patients who were trans that were being treated there. I was so relieved, and made an appointment for blood work, and then an injection. 

Although I pay out of pockets, my injections are kept off of the record from my insurance company and I have a $12 copay to have actual doctor visits. My injections are $39 per injection, but most of the price is a fee to have a nurse administer the injection (required by my Endocrinologist because of their company policy, it may be different for you). I get these twice a month and see my Endocrinologist once every 3-4 months.

My first injection was January 20th, 2012. Already having more testosterone than normal because of my POS, most of my changes happened quickly—within the first 3-5 months of being on testosterone. Some of the good things: my voice deepened pretty quickly, I noticed a steep increase in facial and body hair, and there’s definitely been an increase in libido, although I already had a pretty active sex drive before T. Some of the bad things: my acne got worse (again), and I get a lot more irritable and angry around injection time. 

Here’s a sample of how much my voice has changed (Sorry for the quality of the first one):

For obvious reasons I will not be naming names

Since I was 6, (as far as I can remember) I have always felt that something was wrong with me, I could not point my finger at it, but my brain for some odd reason kept saying I should have been a girl. At this point my family was living outside the U.S, and we were literally trapped in the case all day and night. We were not permitted to go outside, unless it was to help carry the groceries into the house, or go out on the backyard, and we were prohibited from contacting anyone outside of the house. My dad was a very religious person he was very much into the Christian bible (King James Version), but did not claim to be Christian, Jewish, or Jehovah Witness, apparently they all had it wrong. So he mashed together a combination of all three, and forced my mom to believe in his religion, and preached it to us since day 1 that we were born. I didn't know any better at the time; I thought he was telling the truth so it became hegemony for the family.

When I was 6, one morning I told some of my brothers and sisters that I wish I was born a girl. I said it out loud so everyone in the room heard it, and someone decided that it was a good idea to go and tell my dad. It was the worst punishment I got in my life; he took a belt and began to beat with it. He said I was possessed by the devil, and that I should not been thinking stuff like that. He was ""trying"" to beat the transgender out of me. After the beating my whole world shattered, and never said a word about it to anyone. I kept quiet about it, and I believed my dad and I prayed to ""God"" to try to ""cure"" me of this and I tried everything possible to forget about that idea, but it would always find its way back to me and hit me harder. I began to sneak around at night and go downstairs where no one was around (everyone slept on the 2nd floor), and deactivated the alarm and would sneak into the bathroom with some ""girly"" clothes to try on. I don't know why I would do it but it felt right.

When I was 15 years old, my sisters got out of the house while my dad was at work, and pressed charges against him for sexually molesting them. So my dad ran to the U.S and never returned back. I began to find low paying jobs and finally got a place of my own. It was until then that I began to question everything about my childhood. That’s when I realized the non-sense of religion and became an atheist. After losing the religion I began to also do research about gender dysphonia known as gender identity disorder (GID) at the time. I began to argue with myself whether transitioning would be the best option, and this caused a second personality to be created. After about a year I finally agreed to go ahead with the transition, and ended up breaking all the mirrors in my home because I did not want to see my reflection again. This also kind of stopped the second personality, but not entirely (I believe it will forever remain with me). After some research I knew that the best option I had was to move to the U.S to begin the transition.

My dad was a U.S citizen; however, my mom was not. My dad refused to claim us as his children so we could not receive our U.S Citizenship. The process took years and lots of money was wasted. During that time as we fought for our Citizenship I was growing more and more depressed about being transgendered, I wanted to have the transition done already. In 2011, the U.S Consulate finally gave in and gave us our U.S Passport. I began to sell everything and get ready to move out, and contacted a previous family my dad had in the U.S prior to us. A month later I got a plane ticket and with no second guessing myself. I stepped into the plane, I did not care what I would find in the U.S, and all I cared about was getting the transition started. When I arrived the family was very supportive, and eventually I ended up telling a part of the family I was staying with about my transgender issues. They promised to support me through the whole transition, but like a slap to the face they did a 180 on me and began to insult me in the most horrific ways. At the time I was already seeing a therapist, and she told me to grab my things and move out immediately. I tried to talk to the family to get them to stop insulting me, but I should have listened to my therapist from day 1.

In October 2011, I finally had enough and moved away. It was in that same month I found an affordable doctor that could prescribe me the hormones. In November 29th, 2012, I got started on HRT and I began to feel good about myself. Even if I am alone, at least I started my transition. I am tired of being abused, and insulted, for what I am. Is it really that hard to transition? and if so, does it get better overtime?. I can assure you this thou, if hell is real, I have been in it and I am barely stepping out of it. No child has to be tortured and lied to this much because the child was not what you wanted to have.

I have mostly been stalking /r/LGBT, subreddit /r/transgender. I would like to share a short version of my life\'s story in reddit. Let’s see how this goes. (This is my first post; be nice) :p\n\nFor obvious reasons I will not be naming names\n\nSince I was 6, (as far as I can remember) I have always felt that something was wrong with me, I could not point my finger at it, but my brain for some odd reason kept saying I should have been a girl. At this point my family was living outside the U.S, and we were literally trapped in the case all day and night. We were not permitted to go outside, unless it was to help carry the groceries into the house, or go out on the backyard, and we were prohibited from contacting anyone outside of the house. My dad was a very religious person he was very much into the Christian bible (King James Version), but did not claim to be Christian, Jewish, or Jehovah Witness, apparently they all had it wrong. So he mashed together a combination of all three, and forced my mom to believe in his religion, and preached it to us since day 1 that we were born. I didn\'t know any better at the time; I thought he was telling the truth so it became hegemony for the family.\n\nWhen I was 6, one morning I told some of my brothers and sisters that I wish I was born a girl. I said it out loud so everyone in the room heard it, and someone decided that it was a good idea to go and tell my dad. It was the worst punishment I got in my life; he took a belt and began to beat with it. He said I was possessed by the devil, and that I should not been thinking stuff like that. He was ""trying"" to beat the transgender out of me. After the beating my whole world shattered, and never said a word about it to anyone. I kept quiet about it, and I believed my dad and I prayed to ""God"" to try to ""cure"" me of this and I tried everything possible to forget about that idea, but it would always find its way back to me and hit me harder. I began to sneak around at night and go downstairs where no one was around (everyone slept on the 2nd floor), and deactivated the alarm and would sneak into the bathroom with some ""girly"" clothes to try on. I don\'t know why I would do it but it felt right.\n\nWhen I was 15 years old, my sisters got out of the house while my dad was at work, and pressed charges against him for sexually molesting them. So my dad ran to the U.S and never returned back. I began to find low paying jobs and finally got a place of my own. It was until then that I began to question everything about my childhood. That’s when I realized the non-sense of religion and became an atheist. After losing the religion I began to also do research about gender dysphonia known as gender identity disorder (GID) at the time. I began to argue with myself whether transitioning would be the best option, and this caused a second personality to be created. After about a year I finally agreed to go ahead with the transition, and ended up breaking all the mirrors in my home because I did not want to see my reflection again. This also kind of stopped the second personality, but not entirely (I believe it will forever remain with me). After some research I knew that the best option I had was to move to the U.S to begin the transition.\n\nMy dad was a U.S citizen; however, my mom was not. My dad refused to claim us as his children so we could not receive our U.S Citizenship. The process took years and lots of money was wasted. During that time as we fought for our Citizenship I was growing more and more depressed about being transgendered, I wanted to have the transition done already.

I had my first seizure (grand mal). A few weeks later I was diagnosed with epilepsy. This started a long hard process of finding the medication that worked. The side-effects of the high caliber medication gave me behavior issues. I was very violent, and at some points suicidal. I had to deal with this on top of school where I would have frequent brake downs of crying fits. My parents were with me 100% through out this horrible stage. They loved me regardless. I developed voices that I thought were normal. This medication trial deal lasted until I was 11. I continued to take the same medication for about 4 years. I was made fun of a school, and I had to go into the special education program for my issues. I fought against voices, and hallucination that I thought were normal. I could not communicated to my parents that I was having this issue, because I did not understand myself. There were multiple times where I tried to hurt myself, or my poor sister that was stuck in the cross-fire. It's horrible to think about today. This happened until I was 14. They took my off the medication after being seizure free for two years. I grew out of it, which I am extremely grateful for. I then picked up the pieces of the fallout. I battled depression for 2 years. I then became educated enough to describe my feelings. I knew that it was not normal to have voices, and sought out help. Today, I am 17. I've had a voice in my head. Her name is Colleen, and I see plants growing on everything around me. I feel like a female in a males body. I've wanted this since I was young, and now I can tell others this want. I am mentally ill, and my feeling are disregarded as my mental condition. I personal believe that I am simply transgender. I have told my therapist, and he agrees that it is not part of the mental problems that I have. I have not told my parents that I want this. I know that they will love and support me 100%, but I'm so scared. I've dealt with so much, and to say this seems almost insulting, but I've delt with the discomfort, and pain for a long time now. I am on medication for depression, and anti-psychotics that are working at controlling my hallucination. It's a huge down in my life, and as a teenage I'm very confused at who I am. I don't know what to do. I'm so confused, and scared. I am going to wait till things smooth out before I pursue my feeling on the transgender matter, but I need some way to let all this stress, and problems that I have with the body and life I'm currently in. - I have been home schooled for a year now and I plan to go back soon for the rest of my senior year. I know if I try to do something like cross-dressing I would be shunned after I worked very hard to maintain a social life. I am now friends with everyone, and I know all eye will be on me...

I just feel so helpless in my body. So uncomfortable. All the time. And I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this is poorly structured or worded or whatever. My thoughts are all over the place. I'm sorry.

I'm only 16 years old, but I feel as if I was born in the wrong body. People tell me I'm too young to know for sure, but I wish they would understand. As long as I can remember, I've wanted to be the opposite sex. But I can't come out. 

What happens if I say something? Will my friends not like me? Will my family make fun of me and abandon me? I'm so scared. It terrifies me. What if everyone I know leaves me because I want to be a woman?

I live in Georgia. The highly conservative and seemingly close-minded south. I'm just so scared. Everyone at school will make fun of me and call me names. When I look at myself now, it feels as if there's no way out of my situation. Both sides of my family are highly judgmental Roman Catholics. It feels like I'm just complaining, but I can't tell anyone what's wrong with me - even my own family. I'm too scared. My situation hurts. A lot. Every waking moment that I'm a man, it just pains me.. This isn't who I was meant to be. A lot of times, it just feels like the only way out is suicide. 

I wish I could talk to someone about it and let all my feelings out and cry. But I can't. Even as I tear up while writing this, I still won't be able to talk to a therapist or anyone. I'm too shy to meet new people. But I'm also too scared of what people think.

Please help me, r/transgender.. I don't know where I should start or what I should do.

It all just feels so scary and intimidating, but most of all, hopeless. I wish I could be who I really am. But I can't. I cry every time I think about it. The closest thing to feeling welcomed is this subreddit. It's the only thing that gets my hopes up. I've never posted here.

 I am not strong enough. I have thought about it for years. I have talked to people in all different stages of the processes. I have talked to personal friends. I've filled my mind with books and articles and blogs. I have soul-searched for the courage to transition, and I have found it missing.

I have heard the words of mockery and derision slung to people like us. I know which ones of those I love and hold dear would no longer be by my side and that, all alone, is too much to bear.

I will always support the rights of humans over the privledge of prejudices and I will always be proud of you but I cannot do this. I doubt I am alone. You can, though, and you can make the world a better place for those who come after.

Yet that is the case all over the world, with the human rights movement gaining victories slowly and losing ground seemingly as often.\n\nThose of you who have either begun your transition or completed it: I assure you, my envy is only an expression of my desire to join your ranks. I am proud of you all. The smiles of minds finally feeling at home in their bodies are quite unlike any expressions I have ever seen. But these stories, the photos, the smiles... they leave a sadness behind, too.\n\nYou see Reddit, this is a throwaway. For all of the inspirational material that one can trawl up online, I wonder how many people out there are like me: silent, scared, and opressed. How many people out there aren't strong enough to transition?\n\n I am not strong enough. I have thought about it for years. I have talked to people in all different stages of the processes. I have talked to personal friends. I've filled my mind with books and articles and blogs. I have soul-searched for the courage to transition, and I have found it missing.\n\nIt's too much to ask of me. I am a coward. I have seen the looks that are given to that which is not understood, the anger, the prejudice. I have heard the words of mockery and derision slung to people like us. I know which ones of those I love and hold dear would no longer be by my side and that, all alone, is too much to bear.\n\nI will always support the rights of humans over the privledge of prejudices and I will always be proud of you but I cannot do this. I doubt I am alone. You can, though, and you can make the world a better place for those who come after.\n\nTL;DR - I love you all."", 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': 'It might be hard to say it, but it may remind you why you fight.', 'created': 1359186536.0}",
