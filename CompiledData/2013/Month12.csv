I'm one of the editors for a student magazine in the UK, and I'm currently working on an article about the lives of trans* students. 

Several students who identify as trans* have volunteered to be interviewed, so I'm sketching out some questions at the moment. 

I want to explore the reality of life as a trans* students, but I'm not confident of my ability to bring attention to the areas that deserve it, whilst still proving respectful and sensitive. 

If you were in my position, which questions do you think need asking?

Thanks for your help all!

He called me and told me that if I ever make any changes to my body that I'd have no place in his family because he just can't tolerate that. When I came home for holiday break, it got a lot worse. I'd been there for 3 days, and kept arguing with them non-stop. my mother told me that there's 'demons' attacking me and I told her I don't believe that stuff.

I'm sad that I had to be kicked out of my parent's house, but I'll do what I can to keep going. I'm at a Barnes and Noble typing this, because my sis doesn't have Wi-Fi hooked up yet.

TL;DR: I'm trans, my parents found out, they aren't happy. I've been kicked out of my parent's house, and living with my sister for a little while. No idea what to do now.

I guess what I want to try to ask is how can I really be absolutely certain about my gender, or be certain that I am genderqueer?

I was born as a male and raised as one, but I've never quite felt that I fit in with my friends even though I tried. I tried to be as masculine as possible but deep down I knew it wasn't me. 

The last 1.5 - 2 years have seen the most dramatic changes in my view of the world and my perception of myself. I met my SO during this time, and they have been a great influence on me in more ways than I can probably remember. They also identify on some level as genderqueer, and this has set me on a path of really digging in to my own issues with gender. Now, I don't really know what to do with the ""conclusion""(if there ever is one considering gender) I have come to. 

Basically: I don't identify with men, but I don't identify with women either. 

So my biggest problems, I guess, are that I don't know how to 1. Identify myself and 2. Make it clear to others that I don't want to be gendered as a male. 

I should maybe note here that I dress mostly in dark clothes, in a kind of hardcore/anarchist way. And I don't know if I will want to change that, since that is the appearance I like even though it is mostly male-coded. It might also be worth to note that I have a sometimes crippling social anxiety, which may or may not influence the fact that I don't dress feminine. It most likely does in a lot of ways.

I really have no clue what I'm going to do. This is not going to be a structured post. It's going to be a rant or something. I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do. I hate the way my body is right now. I will soon be starting spiro to stop my body from becoming more masculine, but I'm incredibly unhappy and I don't know if I ever will be.

I can't even get my family to accept my pronouns. I told them I prefer they, but now they're saying that's only for a group of people and can't be used that way. So they keep calling me him. It depresses me and I can't do a damn thing about it.

I will be misgendered for the rest of my days being alive.

I don't know how I am going to deal with that. I don't even know what I'm going to do past spiro. If I just keep using spiro without anything else, I will wither away. I evidently have to have a sex hormone. I don't want to develop breasts. I really don't. I would rather I have no genetals at all. I want people to see me as neutral.

I already have a very low self esteem, I have depression, I have gender dysphoria, and I have my family misgendering me. I don't have a clear path I can take, and the government doesn't even recognise my gender legally, nor will it ever.

I don't know what to do. Will I just make a ton of apps and live off of the little money I take in, locking myself inside a small apartment and sustaining myself with ramen? I just don't see a future for me being me. I don't want to pretend to be a gender that I'm not, yet if I want to express who I truly am, I will never be accepted.

Why couldn't I just have been born with nothing? Why couldn't I just be born without any distinguishing genetalia. Why couldn't I just stay neutral forever? Why couldn't I just live with a small, yet equal balance of testosterone and estrogen? Being who I want to be means I'll never be accepted. I have no idea what to do. I don't know who to talk to. I just want to be alone with my thoughts. Women, men, that's all the world knows about. Chose one or get bent they seem to say. But what if I'm neither? What would I even do? How do I explain to people I'd rather be thought of as a person? I want to be thought of as a human being. The media is all about one or the other, websites, the news, society, the government. Nobody gets it. I'm just so tired of it all. I'm just so tired of not getting any satisfaction from life or anyone it seems. I just want to sleep in my warm, makeshift bed and bask in the warmpth, snuggle with my cat forever. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to see anyone, I don't want to talk to anyone. Not my boyfriend, not my parents, not my friends, not the people in #transspace, nobody. So then why am I on reddit? I don't know.

35,2013-12-08 08:17:23,1sdjov,10,19,"TL;DR: Biological male, feel like a tomboy, the disconnect in being a masculine female in a male body is weird, I want to feel like I firmly am a girl or boy and not flip flop.

This is a bit of a late night rant/blah, but I sorta need to get it out somewhere so here goes.

Biologically, I'm male. I don't explicitly hate that (though the hair everywhere can just go fuck itself and die) on most days, but I'm not thrilled to be a guy. Since about 13ish, I've cultivated a online persona of myself as a female and as the years have gone by, in a online sense (where I do most of my socializing, bad I know), I'm known as a female and I like it. I like it because a lot of my heroes are more heroines, at last from a ""I wish I could be..."" sense. Ripley, Sarah Connor, Aya Brea (Not parasite eve 3. &gt;_&gt;) , Samus Aran (Not Other M D:), etc, etc. I thought they were cool and I wanted to be like them. The boys could have their Solid Snake or James Bond.

I've done the cross-dressing and even had a few times where I've really considered that I was transgender. I still do, but the times I feel like doing anything about it (like seek help) have been few and far between. Earlier this year was my first time at seeing a gender therapist, and while it helped, she also helped me get at some deep rooted family issues, but that's neither here nor there. 

Aside from the stigma of bringing this to a RL perspective, it also sorta comes with using what I've got. I've got a male build and unfortunately, hair that goes everywhere. Combined with a not great paycheck, laser and the like isn't perfect. Only recently have I been able to get time to myself to actually start shaving due to getting my own place of sorts. It feels nice, but unfortunately time consuming. :\ When I can try to get myself more feminine, I feel a bit better, but then I sorta go ""Who're you trying to kid?"" 

It also leads into my next point. Despite my weird gender fluidity, I've actually got a girlfriend myself and she's understanding. Though there's been a few times where I can out girl her, and it leaves her feeling less than. Combined with the fact she's looking for me to provide male accompaniment in the bedroom makes me feel all weird and wonky. 

And on that note, sex is a weird thing for me. The most I've ever really done is fool around, and that can be counted on one hand. I've played around online, 95% of the time as female. It feels a bit normal, but then I'll have fantasies where I'm in the more male role (though I'll feel a bit weird I don't nessicarily associate myself as a guy). It just leads to a big feeling of clusterfuck. She definitely likes my feminine side, but I feel like she has a preference for wanting a true boyfriend, even if she won't come out and say it.

I find myself shifting to and fro on the gender spectrum, but it seems to go from tomboy to 20-something atypical girl. Right now, no one would question which gender I look (and it wouldn't be female), and I'm okay with it as... well, I look like what I look like, and trying to explain this asterisk that hangs over my head just drives me nuts. So I don't get really sad or anything like that being called a boy or whatnot.

But of course, Spanish is a gendered language. I personally prefer ""he"", and was getting in trouble for reflexively refering to myself as ""cómico"" instead of ""cómica"" looong before I was out to even myself. But they prefer neutral pronouns. In writing, this isn't too much of a problem: I just use the @. But in speech, it gets tricky.

For those of you that prefer neutral pronouns and speak gendered languages (especially Spanish), what do you do? I've been thinking of using ""oa"" or ""ao"" in place of ""a"" or ""o"", but I feel like that makes it sound like I'm speaking Portuguese.

My female partner/fiancé was asked to be her sisters bridesmaid, and I was asked to be the husbands-to-be's groomsman for a wedding coming up this weekend. We both accepted. 

They (the couple) are obviously progressive in their views - but both come from conservative Christian backgrounds. I'll be standing with his brothers ... their father is a pastor. I've never met any of them before.

My girlfriend's mom, who is usually supportive and nice, picked a rather nasty fight with me at a holiday dinner last week (the married couple-to-be were also present). Her mom ""needed"" me to explain what I would wear and what I should be called. She prefaced it with concern, but her tone and words were biting and harsh. 

I am usually not one to argue, but I had to defend myself once she started asking about where I would even buy clothes .....  *I wear ""men's"" clothes almost exclusively, and have been androgynous since long before I met her*

I let her know (without getting angry) that I live my non-gender-normative lifestyle happily and healthfully every day, and that I am glad to be on the groom's side of a wedding --- because that's what the couple asked me to do. 

I made sure to point out that I had been on the bride's side of the last two weddings I attended, dress and all. 

Fast forward to this morning. The wedding is this Saturday. My girlfriend spoke with her sister and found out they (the couple) stayed to 'talk it out' with the mom. She let them know she was ashamed that she has gay daughters (there are 3 sisters in total, 2 are gay). 

This past weekend the sister saw the mom again. When she brought up the groomsman topic my girlfriends mom told her that ""*I* owe *her* an apology."" --- and that groomsmen and called that for a reason. 

I am proud, and out, and andro and everyone knows it ...  and I know I will be very supported by many of the people at this wedding --- but this overarching ickyness for both me and my girlfriend (and her gay sister / her partner) just sucks. 

This is extra hard for me because this wasn't ""my"" choice... The couple wanted to push the envelope at their wedding and I feel like they're using us to do it. 

As far as I know the mom isn't demanding an apology from him/them for making the choice for having me in the wedding - she's upset at me for going along with it.

55,2013-12-13 08:32:45,1ss9p1,1,12,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this subreddit (and my second time posting on reddit). 

I'm MAAB, and until quite recently I've identified as male, though I never thought it really suited me. I've always had trouble fitting my culture/society's definition of masculinity. As a kid I was very nonathletic and I never really cared for sports (still don't), I was a pretty sensitive kid, I'm not very aggressive or competitive, I like having long hair, and I've always enjoyed dressing up in outlandish outfits that draw attention to myself. However, my disinterest in manliness has never driven me to the point of wanting to identify as a woman. I don't have much dysphoria with my body or genitalia. Although there are some occasions where I feel like I am pretty much a 'man', most of the time I feel like I'm somewhere more or less between being a man or a woman. But for the past 19 years I've stuck with the male identity I'd been given at birth, not because I though it fit me completely, but because until recently I thought there were only 2 genders, and I could only be one or the other.

My perception of gender changed a few months ago when one of my friends at my college came out as genderqueer. I had heard of this concept a few times before, but I didn't really know what it meant, so when they came out, I started to look into it. After looking at a bunch of websites and reading some books on gender theory and non-binary gender identities, I began to think that a genderqueer identity might suit me as well. For the past few weeks, I've begun to identify as an androgyne, and I think this identity fits me better than the male identity I was assigned ever did. Since I've made this change, I've been feeling a lot more confident and less self-conscious because I'm finally allowing myself to do whatever I feel is the right thing to do at a given moment. To emphasize this I've also started to try to appear more androgynous; I bought some skirts at goodwill and I look and feel great wearing them (but I haven't worn them much outside my own room yet, mainly because it's too cold to wear a skirt without leggings outside, but the leggings I ordered finally came in the mail yesterday, so yay! :D), I've started styling my hair in a somewhat more feminine way, and I started shaving my face and chest hair (not that I had much in either of those areas to begin with :P); I'd like to start experimenting with makeup and nail polish, and I'm considering piercing my ears, but it might have to wait because I don't really have a whole lot of money for that right now. I might post a few pictures of myself sometime later, I'd appreciate some advice from y'all!

For now I'm still mostly ok with people using male he/him pronouns, but I may start insisting on they/them at some point. So far, I've only come out to a few of my closer friends, and it seemed like they were ok with it. I am a little concerned about coming out to my family though, not because I'm afraid of a negative reaction, my dad came out as gay a little over a year ago, and everyone was completely accepting about it, and I imagine my coming out will be received similarly, but I am kinda worried that they might misinterpret it; non-binary gender identities are still fairly new to a lot of people, and I imagine I'll have to do a lot explaining to them when I come out.

I'd like to say that I'm really glad I found this subreddit. I've been reading a lot of the posts on here, and it's comforting to know that I'm not alone! You are all very wonderful people! :)

59,2013-12-15 00:55:24,1swhsu,6,7,"do I really want to do it?

I have a raging pantyhose/nylon fetish and, whenever it comes over me (even just a little), I develop the urge to go dress up. But after every single climax, I feel regretful and want to take it all off immediately.

Here's a real life example: I have a small beard right now. It's nice, trimmed and accentuates my face. I really like it and I have plans to let it keep growing. The only time I would ""purely"" want to shave is when I want to change my looks around. But when I go into fetish mode... I want so badly to get rid of it. When I dress up, I have to put tape on so it doesn't clash with the overall look. After I climax, however, I feel proud of myself for not succumbing to the needs of the fetish. This is an irritating, conflicting experience and it summarizes my relationship with my fetish perfectly.

In the past months, I have been experimenting (and without the beard. I went as clean-faced as possible). I will talk to friends on skype while dressed up (and sometimes with the cam on). The first time I did it, I was very backwards, quiet and embarrassed, but after a few more times, it became natural. I went from feeling emotionally backed up and embarrassed to feeling pretty okay. It feels good just from the fact I'm accepting it.

I don't really know where to go from here. I might have dysphoria and I might not. I feel perfectly normal in my body, like it's just right for me and always has been, but I am not enjoying my life to the fullest. I do not really look forward to things I used to absolutely love doing, like drawing or playing video games. I try and try to look for joy in them, but I can't. Even sometimes after I hung with my friends, laughed and spent time with them, I will look back and think, ""I didn't truly enjoy that as much as I could have."" I also have anger issues. I will often get mad and upset over completely fictionalized scenarios in my head. Other times, I get upset with my dad and sister, as well as past problems (which do not plague me as much but could easily come back if I faced that lifestyle, again).

I have been plagued with this for a few years now, but this is the first time I've ever questioned if it may be due to dysphoria. The more I think about being a woman, the more alluring it seems, but I'd probably die if I lost my penis. Plus, dressing up without pantyhose makes the experience feel pointless, but again, it deserves to be explored.

I also haven't told my mom or sis, but I would like to. I need to experiment with dressing up around someone who's physically next to me.

Now that I've reached the end of this post, I'm not really sure what to ask. Do I really sound dysphoric? Or is it just my fetish talking?

This is an irritating, conflicting experience and it summarizes my relationship with my fetish perfectly.\n\nIn the past months, I have been experimenting (and without the beard. I went as clean-faced as possible). I will talk to friends on skype while dressed up (and sometimes with the cam on). The first time I did it, I was very backwards, quiet and embarrassed, but after a few more times, it became natural. I went from feeling emotionally backed up and embarrassed to feeling pretty okay. It feels good just from the fact I\'m accepting it.\n\nI don\'t really know where to go from here. I might have dysphoria and I might not. I feel perfectly normal in my body, like it\'s just right for me and always has been, but I am not enjoying my life to the fullest. I do not really look forward to things I used to absolutely love doing, like drawing or playing video games. I try and try to look for joy in them, but I can\'t. Even sometimes after I hung with my friends, laughed and spent time with them, I will look back and think, ""I didn\'t truly enjoy that as much as I could have."" I also have anger issues. I will often get mad and upset over completely fictionalized scenarios in my head. Other times, I get upset with my dad and sister, as well as past problems (which do not plague me as much but could easily come back if I faced that lifestyle, again).\n\nI have been plagued with this for a few years now, but this is the first time I\'ve ever questioned if it may be due to dysphoria. The more I think about being a woman, the more alluring it seems, but I\'d probably die if I lost my penis. Plus, dressing up without pantyhose makes the experience feel pointless, but again, it deserves to be explored.\n\nI also haven\'t told my mom or sis, but I would like to. I need to experiment with dressing up around someone who\'s physically next to me.\n\nNow that I\'ve reached the end of this post, I\'m not really sure what to ask. Do I really sound dysphoric? Or is it just my fetish talking? Do you think I would really feel better if I became a girl?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I know there's nothing wrong with crossdressing, but the important question is..."", 'created': 1387094124.0}",

Frustration with biological inequality became another issue for me as I was on unisex sport teams, and I always seemed to be the only girl. My best efforts never could seem to match my male teammates. I began to hate the limitations of the female body more than ever my senior year in high school; I had been running competitively on track and cross country teams for six years, and young freshman guys with no training were lapping me a couple weeks into the season. I worked hard, I was the fastest on the girl team, but still it baffled me that I had certain biological incapacities because I was female. Religious at the time, I was angry at God, for making me weak, it seemed unfair.

As I have undergone a change in belief systems, now relying only on scientific methods as means for truth and answers, I understand that the physical inequality between men and women is due to how we evolved, a result of how our species survived and raised offspring in harsh natural conditions. Not because some mean deity wanted me to be a domestic slave to another gender. But I am still frustrated day to day with being female, I still dislike the separation between men and women. I wish either no gender existed, as to leave us undivided. Sometimes I imagine a reality where numerous genders existed, with multiple different types of people having different but equally important purposes in society, or some kind of situation where you can chose your hand in a group reproductive process.

I’m 20 in five days, thus far I’ve lead a straight lifestyle. I was, until yesterday, in a relationship with a guy for four months. He is the first person I have ever been completely sexually active with. When we first started having sex I wanted to do it multiple times a day, it was new and exciting to me. But after a few months it started to become boring because no amount of penetration or foreplay would bring me to an orgasm. I have only had one orgasm, with another guy, through dry humping. This became a great source of frustration for me and I realized I have HUGE penis envy. I kind of resented him, and guys in general, for being able to achieve these moments of intense pleasure, once a day, and never being able to have them myself. It makes me frustrated and unsatisfied with my female body. 

Additionally, we really clashed on some gender role issues and it got me thinking a lot about myself in regards some changes I want to make, but have been sweeping under the rug because I don’t know how to deal with them. I am thinking about changing my outward appearance to match the more masculine side of me that dominates my personality. I have long, golden hair that falls a few inches below my chest and I want to get a really short haircut to make myself look more boyish, but I’m worried I might regret it. My friends who cut their hair short get fewer dates. Though I am mainly attracted to men I am bicourious and also wondering if I might be much happier dating women, who could be better for me sexually and emotionally? Like I said I’ve lead a straight lifestyle thus far and I have no clue what it would be like.

I'm still very much exploring my gender identity. I generally identify as male (which is what it says on my birth certificate), but I love dressing in feminine clothes. On various days I range in expression from male (at work) to femboy (what I default to in public) to female (mostly at home). I don't object to male pronouns, or any pronouns really, but I don't really feel like I fit in to any gender, partially because gender lines seem so arbitrary at times. 
Anyway, this past Monday I took the plunge and entertained some guests wearing a dress. It was a wonderful experience, and it felt so natural. I really do feel more comfortable in female clothing, and it was great to be able to express it among friends.
But now I'm ready to take the next step and come out to my parents. I plan to wear a dress when we come over for Christmas morning. They already suspect something, according to my sister and wife, as I've already dressed pretty femmy around then, so this is really not that much of a leap.

I'd say I want to be a guy something like 85% of the time, while the rest of the time I wish I could be pretty and girly.

90,2013-12-25 06:58:28,1tnsnt,5,10,"Hi folks, just wondering if anyone here can relate to this dilemma. Let me paint the picture for you. So you're backpacking (pick your favourite country) and you're a somewhat feminine guy. You'd like to make a road pal -- someone to hang around with on the excursions, talk to on the bus, and what not. What do you do when the whole world just seems so heteronormative?

Say you try to pal up with some guy. It starts out okay, but pretty soon he pegs you as non-buddy material. You're a little too excitable, or you don't make enough bawdy jokes, or you're not built athletically enough, or you made the mistake of talking about how you ""feel"" about something (word choice is key), or you talk with your hands too much. Whatever it is, you're just not enough of a ""dude's dude"", let's say. (Or is it ""bro"" now? Gosh I'm old…)

The alternative is to try to pal up with some cool girl, but that's fraught with pitfalls too. The friendlier you are, the more likely she is to think you're hitting on her. In that case, either she's into it or she isn't. If she isn't, then she's likely to keep at a safe distance from you for the rest of the trip. If she /is/ into it that's even worse, cuz now ya got a lovesick dame on yer hands. (Yeah, I slip into the 1920s now and again. Sorry.)

In this case sometimes I think there's only one thing you can do, which is to convince the girl that you're gay, even if you're not. You don't even have to act flamboyant, you can just casually mention your boyfriend, even if you don't have one. But this kind of sucks. You're trying to make a friend. Doesn't it suck to start right off *lying* about yourself -- in a big way -- to a person you want to be friends with?

As for the straight-up truth: ""I'm a feminine guy who doesn't conform to the gender binary,"" I'm afraid there are still very few people in the world who will totally get that. (Or maybe I'm too chicken to try saying it…..)

But okay, okay, suppose you even find some cool girl who accepts you as a travel pal. You *still* don't have all the benefits that an actual girl would have, like being able to share a room with this person, even if in God's own truth you are as harmless as a kitten.

So? Anybody out there have any great solutions? Tales from the road? A desire to commiserate?

p.s. I also hate that I can't sleep in the girls' dorm at the hostel, which I imagine to be a kind of jasmine-scented shangri-la. In any case it must smell a heck of a lot better than the guys' dorm. Shouldn't it be the *effeminate persons' dorm* really? I know I know, I could still want to have sex with them, and that's the real problem. But what if I'm so effeminate that most of the girls are stronger than me? Then I'm safe, aren't I?

I have been having encountered emotions and I have no idea how to deal with that, on one hand the stereotyped part of me which believes is the right thing to do wants to fully stop and just be the big ""macho"" for my wife, and on the other hand I would like to be fully honest with her but I think that could jeopardize my marriage.

A childhood and adolescence in a small, conservative, redneck town meant I never expressed these feelings, and limited internet exposure means I didn't know the terminology (or even that I wasn't the only one) until I was eighteen.

I have a couple trans* friends who have talked to me about how they felt different in regards to their gender, and I really relate to almost all of them. I posted [this on /r/asktransgender](http://i.imgur.com/8QOzMBC.jpg) and generally felt I could relate to a lot of the responses, but at the same time, I still feel on some level at least, that I want to be male. It's like at times I'm presenting as something I'm not, for a multitude of reasons(can't be perceived as gay by my parents who are very anti-gay, and anti-everything to be honest, which really hurts) and lately has been pretty much the only thing on my mind and is starting to really get to me.

I guess what I want to try to ask is how can I really be absolutely certain about my gender, or be certain that I am genderqueer? I've emotionally been all over the place lately and have felt the strong desire to be everything from the typical masculine male (I'm into fitness), a feminine woman, and a rather androgynous male, but I am really just lost at this point. I've recently being afraid of this continued 'back and forth' between wanting to be one gender and then something else at another time. 

Could this all be caused by the newness of me really being critical about what I feel and identify as, combined with the rather strict and ""traditional"" (bigoted) upbringing? I honestly have never given it much thoutht aside from the last few weeks and I'm surprising myself with how deeply I relate or react to some thoughts. Right now I'm just waiting for another appointment with my counsellor so I can talk about these things further, but I'm just at a loss of what I should really being trying to figure out, and am just kind of going with the flow, so to speak, until I kind of calm down and am able to really think about. Sorry for the rant but this is just bothering me so much lately and I guess getting it all out and getting some input from people is always helpful, and thanks for listening :)

I\'ve recently being afraid of this continued \'back and forth\' between wanting to be one gender and then something else at another time. \n\nCould this all be caused by the newness of me really being critical about what I feel and identify as, combined with the rather strict and ""traditional"" (bigoted) upbringing? I honestly have never given it much thoutht aside from the last few weeks and I\'m surprising myself with how deeply I relate or react to some thoughts. Right now I\'m just waiting for another appointment with my counsellor so I can talk about these things further, but I\'m just at a loss of what I should really being trying to figure out, and am just kind of going with the flow, so to speak, until I kind of calm down and am able to really think about. Sorry for the rant but this is just bothering me so much lately and I guess getting it all out and getting some input from people is always helpful, and thanks for listening :)\n\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""Questioning my gender, I'm lost"", 'created': 1386219535.0}",19.0
28,2013-12-05 01:47:24,1s4kc8,13,6,"Hello /r/genderqueer. I am having some trouble and kind of feel like I need your help. 

I was born as a male and raised as one, but I've never quite felt that I fit in with my friends even though I tried. I tried to be as masculine as possible but deep down I knew it wasn't me. 

The last 1.5 - 2 years have seen the most dramatic changes in my view of the world and my perception of myself. I met my SO during this time, and they have been a great influence on me in more ways than I can probably remember. They also identify on some level as genderqueer, and this has set me on a path of really digging in to my own issues with gender. Now, I don't really know what to do with the ""conclusion""(if there ever is one considering gender) I have come to. 

Basically: I don't identify with men, but I don't identify with women either. 

So my biggest problems, I guess, are that I don't know how to 1. Identify myself and 2. Make it clear to others that I don't want to be gendered as a male. 

I should maybe note here that I dress mostly in dark clothes, in a kind of hardcore/anarchist way. And I don't know if I will want to change that, since that is the appearance I like even though it is mostly male-coded. It might also be worth to note that I have a sometimes crippling social anxiety, which may or may not influence the fact that I don't dress feminine. It most likely does in a lot of ways. 

Well, any tips, advice, thoughts, responses or whatever are very welcome.

I really have no clue what I'm going to do. This is not going to be a structured post. It's going to be a rant or something. I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do. I hate the way my body is right now. I will soon be starting spiro to stop my body from becoming more masculine, but I'm incredibly unhappy and I don't know if I ever will be.

I can't even get my family to accept my pronouns. I told them I prefer they, but now they're saying that's only for a group of people and can't be used that way. So they keep calling me him. It depresses me and I can't do a damn thing about it.

I will be misgendered for the rest of my days being alive.

I don't know how I am going to deal with that. I don't even know what I'm going to do past spiro. If I just keep using spiro without anything else, I will wither away. I evidently have to have a sex hormone. I don't want to develop breasts. I really don't. I would rather I have no genetals at all. I want people to see me as neutral.

I already have a very low self esteem, I have depression, I have gender dysphoria, and I have my family misgendering me. I don't have a clear path I can take, and the government doesn't even recognise my gender legally, nor will it ever.

I don't know what to do. Will I just make a ton of apps and live off of the little money I take in, locking myself inside a small apartment and sustaining myself with ramen? I just don't see a future for me being me. I don't want to pretend to be a gender that I'm not, yet if I want to express who I truly am, I will never be accepted.

Why couldn't I just have been born with nothing? Why couldn't I just be born without any distinguishing genetalia. Why couldn't I just stay neutral forever? Why couldn't I just live with a small, yet equal balance of testosterone and estrogen? Being who I want to be means I'll never be accepted. I have no idea what to do. I don't know who to talk to. I just want to be alone with my thoughts. Women, men, that's all the world knows about. Chose one or get bent they seem to say. But what if I'm neither? What would I even do? How do I explain to people I'd rather be thought of as a person? I want to be thought of as a human being. The media is all about one or the other, websites, the news, society, the government. Nobody gets it. I'm just so tired of it all. I'm just so tired of not getting any satisfaction from life or anyone it seems. I just want to sleep in my warm, makeshift bed and bask in the warmpth, snuggle with my cat forever. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to see anyone, I don't want to talk to anyone. Not my boyfriend, not my parents, not my friends, not the people in #transspace, nobody. So then why am I on reddit? I don't know.

48,2013-12-08 08:17:23,1sdjov,10,19,"TL;DR: Biological male, feel like a tomboy, the disconnect in being a masculine female in a male body is weird, I want to feel like I firmly am a girl or boy and not flip flop.

This is a bit of a late night rant/blah, but I sorta need to get it out somewhere so here goes.

Biologically, I'm male. I don't explicitly hate that (though the hair everywhere can just go fuck itself and die) on most days, but I'm not thrilled to be a guy. Since about 13ish, I've cultivated a online persona of myself as a female and as the years have gone by, in a online sense (where I do most of my socializing, bad I know), I'm known as a female and I like it. I like it because a lot of my heroes are more heroines, at last from a ""I wish I could be..."" sense. Ripley, Sarah Connor, Aya Brea (Not parasite eve 3. &gt;_&gt;) , Samus Aran (Not Other M D:), etc, etc. I thought they were cool and I wanted to be like them. The boys could have their Solid Snake or James Bond.

I've done the cross-dressing and even had a few times where I've really considered that I was transgender. I still do, but the times I feel like doing anything about it (like seek help) have been few and far between. Earlier this year was my first time at seeing a gender therapist, and while it helped, she also helped me get at some deep rooted family issues, but that's neither here nor there. 

Aside from the stigma of bringing this to a RL perspective, it also sorta comes with using what I've got. I've got a male build and unfortunately, hair that goes everywhere. Combined with a not great paycheck, laser and the like isn't perfect. Only recently have I been able to get time to myself to actually start shaving due to getting my own place of sorts. It feels nice, but unfortunately time consuming. :\ When I can try to get myself more feminine, I feel a bit better, but then I sorta go ""Who're you trying to kid?"" 

It also leads into my next point. Despite my weird gender fluidity, I've actually got a girlfriend myself and she's understanding. Though there's been a few times where I can out girl her, and it leaves her feeling less than. Combined with the fact she's looking for me to provide male accompaniment in the bedroom makes me feel all weird and wonky. 

And on that note, sex is a weird thing for me. The most I've ever really done is fool around, and that can be counted on one hand. I've played around online, 95% of the time as female. It feels a bit normal, but then I'll have fantasies where I'm in the more male role (though I'll feel a bit weird I don't nessicarily associate myself as a guy). It just leads to a big feeling of clusterfuck. She definitely likes my feminine side, but I feel like she has a preference for wanting a true boyfriend, even if she won't come out and say it.

I find myself shifting to and fro on the gender spectrum, but it seems to go from tomboy to 20-something atypical girl. Right now, no one would question which gender I look (and it wouldn't be female), and I'm okay with it as... well, I look like what I look like, and trying to explain this asterisk that hangs over my head just drives me nuts. So I don't get really sad or anything like that being called a boy or whatnot.

My female partner/fiancé was asked to be her sisters bridesmaid, and I was asked to be the husbands-to-be's groomsman for a wedding coming up this weekend. We both accepted. 

They (the couple) are obviously progressive in their views - but both come from conservative Christian backgrounds. I'll be standing with his brothers ... their father is a pastor. I've never met any of them before.

My girlfriend's mom, who is usually supportive and nice, picked a rather nasty fight with me at a holiday dinner last week (the married couple-to-be were also present). Her mom ""needed"" me to explain what I would wear and what I should be called. She prefaced it with concern, but her tone and words were biting and harsh. 

I am usually not one to argue, but I had to defend myself once she started asking about where I would even buy clothes .....  *I wear ""men's"" clothes almost exclusively, and have been androgynous since long before I met her*

I let her know (without getting angry) that I live my non-gender-normative lifestyle happily and healthfully every day, and that I am glad to be on the groom's side of a wedding --- because that's what the couple asked me to do. 

I made sure to point out that I had been on the bride's side of the last two weddings I attended, dress and all. 

Fast forward to this morning. The wedding is this Saturday. My girlfriend spoke with her sister and found out they (the couple) stayed to 'talk it out' with the mom. She let them know she was ashamed that she has gay daughters (there are 3 sisters in total, 2 are gay). 

This past weekend the sister saw the mom again. When she brought up the groomsman topic my girlfriends mom told her that ""*I* owe *her* an apology."" --- and that groomsmen and called that for a reason. 

I am proud, and out, and andro and everyone knows it ...  and I know I will be very supported by many of the people at this wedding --- but this overarching ickyness for both me and my girlfriend (and her gay sister / her partner) just sucks. 

This is extra hard for me because this wasn't ""my"" choice... The couple wanted to push the envelope at their wedding and I feel like they're using us to do it. 

As far as I know the mom isn't demanding an apology from him/them for making the choice for having me in the wedding - she's upset at me for going along with it. 

How have you dealt with situations like this? Have you ever been put into a situation where you are the token-queer? Why can't people just get the f*ck over the gender thing?

85,2013-12-13 08:32:45,1ss9p1,1,12,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this subreddit (and my second time posting on reddit). 

I'm MAAB, and until quite recently I've identified as male, though I never thought it really suited me. I've always had trouble fitting my culture/society's definition of masculinity. As a kid I was very nonathletic and I never really cared for sports (still don't), I was a pretty sensitive kid, I'm not very aggressive or competitive, I like having long hair, and I've always enjoyed dressing up in outlandish outfits that draw attention to myself. However, my disinterest in manliness has never driven me to the point of wanting to identify as a woman. I don't have much dysphoria with my body or genitalia. Although there are some occasions where I feel like I am pretty much a 'man', most of the time I feel like I'm somewhere more or less between being a man or a woman. But for the past 19 years I've stuck with the male identity I'd been given at birth, not because I though it fit me completely, but because until recently I thought there were only 2 genders, and I could only be one or the other.

My perception of gender changed a few months ago when one of my friends at my college came out as genderqueer. I had heard of this concept a few times before, but I didn't really know what it meant, so when they came out, I started to look into it. After looking at a bunch of websites and reading some books on gender theory and non-binary gender identities, I began to think that a genderqueer identity might suit me as well. For the past few weeks, I've begun to identify as an androgyne, and I think this identity fits me better than the male identity I was assigned ever did. Since I've made this change, I've been feeling a lot more confident and less self-conscious because I'm finally allowing myself to do whatever I feel is the right thing to do at a given moment. To emphasize this I've also started to try to appear more androgynous; I bought some skirts at goodwill and I look and feel great wearing them (but I haven't worn them much outside my own room yet, mainly because it's too cold to wear a skirt without leggings outside, but the leggings I ordered finally came in the mail yesterday, so yay! :D), I've started styling my hair in a somewhat more feminine way, and I started shaving my face and chest hair (not that I had much in either of those areas to begin with :P); I'd like to start experimenting with makeup and nail polish, and I'm considering piercing my ears, but it might have to wait because I don't really have a whole lot of money for that right now. I might post a few pictures of myself sometime later, I'd appreciate some advice from y'all!

For now I'm still mostly ok with people using male he/him pronouns, but I may start insisting on they/them at some point. So far, I've only come out to a few of my closer friends, and it seemed like they were ok with it. I am a little concerned about coming out to my family though, not because I'm afraid of a negative reaction, my dad came out as gay a little over a year ago, and everyone was completely accepting about it, and I imagine my coming out will be received similarly, but I am kinda worried that they might misinterpret it; non-binary gender identities are still fairly new to a lot of people, and I imagine I'll have to do a lot explaining to them when I come out.

I'd like to say that I'm really glad I found this subreddit. I've been reading a lot of the posts on here, and it's comforting to know that I'm not alone! You are all very wonderful people! :)

I've always had trouble fitting my culture/society's definition of masculinity. As a kid I was very nonathletic and I never really cared for sports (still don't), I was a pretty sensitive kid, I'm not very aggressive or competitive, I like having long hair, and I've always enjoyed dressing up in outlandish outfits that draw attention to myself. However, my disinterest in manliness has never driven me to the point of wanting to identify as a woman. I don't have much dysphoria with my body or genitalia. Although there are some occasions where I feel like I am pretty much a 'man', most of the time I feel like I'm somewhere more or less between being a man or a woman. But for the past 19 years I've stuck with the male identity I'd been given at birth, not because I though it fit me completely, but because until recently I thought there were only 2 genders, and I could only be one or the other.\n\nMy perception of gender changed a few months ago when one of my friends at my college came out as genderqueer.

I have a raging pantyhose/nylon fetish and, whenever it comes over me (even just a little), I develop the urge to go dress up. But after every single climax, I feel regretful and want to take it all off immediately.

Here's a real life example: I have a small beard right now. It's nice, trimmed and accentuates my face. I really like it and I have plans to let it keep growing. The only time I would ""purely"" want to shave is when I want to change my looks around. But when I go into fetish mode... I want so badly to get rid of it. When I dress up, I have to put tape on so it doesn't clash with the overall look. After I climax, however, I feel proud of myself for not succumbing to the needs of the fetish. This is an irritating, conflicting experience and it summarizes my relationship with my fetish perfectly.

In the past months, I have been experimenting (and without the beard. I went as clean-faced as possible). I will talk to friends on skype while dressed up (and sometimes with the cam on). The first time I did it, I was very backwards, quiet and embarrassed, but after a few more times, it became natural. I went from feeling emotionally backed up and embarrassed to feeling pretty okay. It feels good just from the fact I'm accepting it.

I don't really know where to go from here. I might have dysphoria and I might not. I feel perfectly normal in my body, like it's just right for me and always has been, but I am not enjoying my life to the fullest. I do not really look forward to things I used to absolutely love doing, like drawing or playing video games. I try and try to look for joy in them, but I can't. Even sometimes after I hung with my friends, laughed and spent time with them, I will look back and think, ""I didn't truly enjoy that as much as I could have."" I also have anger issues. I will often get mad and upset over completely fictionalized scenarios in my head. Other times, I get upset with my dad and sister, as well as past problems (which do not plague me as much but could easily come back if I faced that lifestyle, again).

I have been plagued with this for a few years now, but this is the first time I've ever questioned if it may be due to dysphoria. The more I think about being a woman, the more alluring it seems, but I'd probably die if I lost my penis. Plus, dressing up without pantyhose makes the experience feel pointless, but again, it deserves to be explored.

I also haven't told my mom or sis, but I would like to. I need to experiment with dressing up around someone who's physically next to me.

First and foremost it started at age five, being obligated to wear a dress to Sunday school and cross my legs the three hour duration of church. “Don’t spread your legs like that”, I remember my mom and teachers saying. “Why can’t I wear pants?” I whined about this on more than one occasion. “Because girls wear dresses to look pretty!” .From then on it seemed boys could do everything I couldn’t. Boys got to go on cool campouts for scouts and we (more specifically I) were stuck making crafts for Wednesday night activities. Men get the priesthood and the opportunity to be leaders, women were “preordained” to primarily take care of children and be a home maker (which I always envisioned as doing chores all day around the house, because that’s what my mom did). Frustration with biological inequality became another issue for me as I was on unisex sport teams, and I always seemed to be the only girl. My best efforts never could seem to match my male teammates. I began to hate the limitations of the female body more than ever my senior year in high school; I had been running competitively on track and cross country teams for six years, and young freshman guys with no training were lapping me a couple weeks into the season. I worked hard, I was the fastest on the girl team, but still it baffled me that I had certain biological incapacities because I was female. Religious at the time, I was angry at God, for making me weak, it seemed unfair.

As I have undergone a change in belief systems, now relying only on scientific methods as means for truth and answers, I understand that the physical inequality between men and women is due to how we evolved, a result of how our species survived and raised offspring in harsh natural conditions. Not because some mean deity wanted me to be a domestic slave to another gender. But I am still frustrated day to day with being female, I still dislike the separation between men and women. I wish either no gender existed, as to leave us undivided. Sometimes I imagine a reality where numerous genders existed, with multiple different types of people having different but equally important purposes in society, or some kind of situation where you can chose your hand in a group reproductive process.

I’m 20 in five days, thus far I’ve lead a straight lifestyle. I was, until yesterday, in a relationship with a guy for four months. He is the first person I have ever been completely sexually active with. When we first started having sex I wanted to do it multiple times a day, it was new and exciting to me. But after a few months it started to become boring because no amount of penetration or foreplay would bring me to an orgasm. I have only had one orgasm, with another guy, through dry humping. This became a great source of frustration for me and I realized I have HUGE penis envy. I kind of resented him, and guys in general, for being able to achieve these moments of intense pleasure, once a day, and never being able to have them myself. It makes me frustrated and unsatisfied with my female body. 

Additionally, we really clashed on some gender role issues and it got me thinking a lot about myself in regards some changes I want to make, but have been sweeping under the rug because I don’t know how to deal with them. I am thinking about changing my outward appearance to match the more masculine side of me that dominates my personality. I have long, golden hair that falls a few inches below my chest and I want to get a really short haircut to make myself look more boyish, but I’m worried I might regret it. My friends who cut their hair short get fewer dates. Though I am mainly attracted to men I am bicourious and also wondering if I might be much happier dating women, who could be better for me sexually and emotionally? Like I said I’ve lead a straight lifestyle thus far and I have no clue what it would be like.

I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend about our previous sex life together and she suggested that I might be transgendered.

She's not right. I sense no gender dysphoria, have many traditionally ""male"" interests and identify easily with my male friends. I've never had much reason to consider my gender identity beyond that, before. However, since I started paying attention and thinking about it, there are many ways in which I interact with people that I would deem to be ""feminine"". These range from growing my hair long to keeping several close ""girlfriends"". I've also just entered a new relationship with a very confident, active woman with some similarly ""masculine"" traits (she doesn't tend to dress up; keeps many male friends, etc). I feel like I'm occupying a feminine role in our relationship... and I'm loving it.

Since I've started thinking about this, I've come up with so many questions for myself that I'm having trouble answering. I'd like to decide if I'm part woman, or if I just have some slightly confusing sexual fetishes. Can any of you please help?

My questions:

I sense no gender dysphoria, have many traditionally ""male"" interests and identify easily with my male friends. I\'ve never had much reason to consider my gender identity beyond that, before. However, since I started paying attention and thinking about it, there are many ways in which I interact with people that I would deem to be ""feminine"". These range from growing my hair long to keeping several close ""girlfriends"". I\'ve also just entered a new relationship with a very confident, active woman with some similarly ""masculine"" traits (she doesn\'t tend to dress up; keeps many male friends, etc). I feel like I\'m occupying a feminine role in our relationship... and I\'m loving it.\n\nSince I\'ve started thinking about this, I\'ve come up with so many questions for myself that I\'m having trouble answering.

 I'd prefer you gender me before you read the next part, just so I can get a more unbiased opinion. Life updates kind of give away the direction I'm transitioning towards.

Okay, so to start, I am biologically female. I think what made me start questioning my gender was when I realised I had a cross-dressing fetish. I never battled much with the realisation of the fetish, I already knew I had a bondage fetish and there's quite a bit of overlap between the two. The more I thought about though, the more I started realising other things.

I had always been tomboyish and was a complete misfit at my all-girls primary school. I've never really fit into any of the stereotypical female roles, I have virtually no interest in being a mother or a wife, for example. I've never been someone who fussed over boys, in fact I've had remarkably few crushes in comparison to my female friends.

On the flip side, I've never really fit into typically male niches either, I'm not athletic, nor do I feel like the husband title would suit me better. I do have sexual fantasies involving being a guy and being pounded by another guy.

Another thing I've noticed too is that I am generally more comfortable around other guys but I think this might just be because I have had a lot of friendships with girls that ended badly and I've become resentful because of that and of being bullied in primary school by other girls.

I'm still very much exploring my gender identity. I generally identify as male (which is what it says on my birth certificate), but I love dressing in feminine clothes. On various days I range in expression from male (at work) to femboy (what I default to in public) to female (mostly at home). I don't object to male pronouns, or any pronouns really, but I don't really feel like I fit in to any gender, partially because gender lines seem so arbitrary at times. 
Anyway, this past Monday I took the plunge and entertained some guests wearing a dress. It was a wonderful experience, and it felt so natural. I really do feel more comfortable in female clothing, and it was great to be able to express it among friends.
But now I'm ready to take the next step and come out to my parents. I plan to wear a dress when we come over for Christmas morning. They already suspect something, according to my sister and wife, as I've already dressed pretty femmy around then, so this is really not that much of a leap. I know they'll take it well, after all they already are used to both me and my sister being oddballs, so I don't anticipate anything but support from them.

I'm a guy in my early 20's. I've kind of liked women's clothes and girly things for about a decade now. I don't think I'm transgender though, because I do like being a guy most of the time. I'd say I want to be a guy something like 85% of the time, while the rest of the time I wish I could be pretty and girly. I know some bi-gender people, and they tend to all go for an androgynous look, which seems to work for them.

I'm above average height and pretty hairy, and I've also been putting on a little muscle lately, so this actually seems pretty achievable to me.

Just crossdressing privately despite looking masculine doesn't do anything for me either. I'm too hairy, too masculine, I regret it within a minute or two of putting anything on, it just doesn't look good. I don't feel sexy, I don't feel pretty, I just feel like a sad joke.

So it doesn't seem like there's any way for me to indulge my feminine side without forsaking my masculine side, and vice versa. I could make a good man by my standards, while I can't really say I think I'd make a very good woman.

My long hair gets pulled back into a low ponytail, I have my hair line shaved up further to look more masculine, my chest gets flattened with a binder and darker makeup lightly accentuates certain facial features to make them look more masculine. \n\nBut despite all I do I always get misgendered when out and about. It make me very sad because at the moment I'm not a woman, I'm male, a effeminate male, but male all the same. I dont know what more I can do, I'm not a very masculine person so I go for a more androgynous appearance to suit my physical structure. I'm just so depressed about this lately, I've finally come to realization how it is I feel emotionally, mentally and sexually and it just stabs me in the heart when I get called a lady, or a girl, or woman on the days I'm in actuality male"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'So very disheartened', 'created': 1387934995.0}",88.0

142,2013-12-25 06:58:28,1tnsnt,5,10,"Hi folks, just wondering if anyone here can relate to this dilemma. Let me paint the picture for you. So you're backpacking (pick your favourite country) and you're a somewhat feminine guy. You'd like to make a road pal -- someone to hang around with on the excursions, talk to on the bus, and what not. What do you do when the whole world just seems so heteronormative?

Say you try to pal up with some guy. It starts out okay, but pretty soon he pegs you as non-buddy material. You're a little too excitable, or you don't make enough bawdy jokes, or you're not built athletically enough, or you made the mistake of talking about how you ""feel"" about something (word choice is key), or you talk with your hands too much. Whatever it is, you're just not enough of a ""dude's dude"", let's say. (Or is it ""bro"" now? Gosh I'm old…)

The alternative is to try to pal up with some cool girl, but that's fraught with pitfalls too. The friendlier you are, the more likely she is to think you're hitting on her. In that case, either she's into it or she isn't. If she isn't, then she's likely to keep at a safe distance from you for the rest of the trip. If she /is/ into it that's even worse, cuz now ya got a lovesick dame on yer hands. (Yeah, I slip into the 1920s now and again. Sorry.)

In this case sometimes I think there's only one thing you can do, which is to convince the girl that you're gay, even if you're not. You don't even have to act flamboyant, you can just casually mention your boyfriend, even if you don't have one. But this kind of sucks. You're trying to make a friend. Doesn't it suck to start right off *lying* about yourself -- in a big way -- to a person you want to be friends with?

As for the straight-up truth: ""I'm a feminine guy who doesn't conform to the gender binary,"" I'm afraid there are still very few people in the world who will totally get that. (Or maybe I'm too chicken to try saying it…..)

But okay, okay, suppose you even find some cool girl who accepts you as a travel pal. You *still* don't have all the benefits that an actual girl would have, like being able to share a room with this person, even if in God's own truth you are as harmless as a kitten.

So? Anybody out there have any great solutions? Tales from the road? A desire to commiserate?

p.s. I also hate that I can't sleep in the girls' dorm at the hostel, which I imagine to be a kind of jasmine-scented shangri-la. In any case it must smell a heck of a lot better than the guys' dorm. Shouldn't it be the *effeminate persons' dorm* really? I know I know, I could still want to have sex with them, and that's the real problem. But what if I'm so effeminate that most of the girls are stronger than me? Then I'm safe, aren't I?

But ever since I was 11 I have liked to masturbate wearing female clothes, when I was young didn't gave it importance, later I thought it was eventually going to pass, but now is getting out of hand, my wife allows me to wear her panties which I do some days and all day long as aroused as it gets, but she doesn't know that I masturbate or at least she pretends she doesn't (really can't tell). She thinks that is only a bottom underwear thing but when I have the chance (she is spending the day with her mom etc) I wear all female clothes, it turns me on so bad.

Also the idea of having female breast drives me crazy, sometimes I fantasize  of transitioning to a female body but keeping my dingo, or being able to go out with full female clothes, but then I snap out of it and start feeling worried, I don't have the slightest feminine look, I would be an average man with boobs or a male with the wrong wardrobe, and in my country they are fairly homophobic, a slight change of someone not being straight is source of mockery and humiliation, so no even a chance of making them understand that there may be something in the middle,  my family and friendships would be ashamed and would never talk to me again.

I have been having encountered emotions and I have no idea how to deal with that, on one hand the stereotyped part of me which believes is the right thing to do wants to fully stop and just be the big ""macho"" for my wife, and on the other hand I would like to be fully honest with her but I think that could jeopardize my marriage.

I have such a battle inside, so many stuff on my mind I could write a book about all the stuff I feel and why do I do what I do.

What do you think?
