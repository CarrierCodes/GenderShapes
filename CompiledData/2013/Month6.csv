I'm not sure what I expect to gain by posting it here, advice? Someone to tell me that they feel the same? Someone to tell me it’s all rubbish? I really don’t know. Being in the float tank has relaxed me in a way that has helped me write all this down for the first time. That's why I'm sharing it now. *&lt;/preface&gt;

So today I went to a floatation tank. I've always wanted to go into one as I've loved the idea of no physical input, and being able to relax and destress totally. It brought on this stream of consciousness, which has turned into almost every thought and feeling I’ve had for years now. It can get kind of graphic in parts. 

But during that pretty amazing experience, my mind went where it always goes when I’m relaxed, or have nothing else to think about.
It went to the woman. That woman inside that I think about and wish I could be. That woman who I’m not sure even exists.

During my float, when all the itches and niggles started to fade away, I started to think. I started to imagine myself as this girl, this young girl, a teenager sitting outside with her boyfriend, and for the first time they kissed, I kissed him, and it was wonderful. That kissing started to get more urgent, both in a physical sense in that I started to imagine that more was happening, some stroking, some touching, but also the mental need that I wanted him. I wanted him to love me and I wanted to feel loved. I wanted that so badly. Things went further and we started having sex, and I wanted it so badly, I wanted to feel him inside me, and I wanted to feel loved by him. This was what I was feeling both as the girl I was imagining, but also as the man inside the tank. As things went further and further this mental and physical feeling built up and up until my body felt full of energy, it felt like an orgasm I’ve never felt before, and it spread throughout my whole body. My toes tingled, and curled into small balls, and my back arched in the air as this feeling built up and up into it just exploded, and I felt as relaxed as I ever could be, with this warm feeling just slowly fading away. 
I desperately wanted to be this woman, and hated the fact that this little experience was over.
I don’t know exactly what I felt, because I’m not sure I’ve ever felt it before, but it felt good all the same. I thought at the time that was I arching my back because that’s how women orgasm? Or is it because I’ve seen that in porn/my own real life girlfriend before? Did that feeling come about because it’s what I’ve heard the female orgasm feel like? My mind then starts to wonder and I start to think if I’m just thinking all of this for my own pleasure, is it a fetish that I like the idea of being a woman? Or does it go deeper? 

I have on many occasions masturbated to the idea of being a woman, but this time in the tank it felt much deeper, perhaps because it was easier to imagine that I was her, and not just some sweaty disgusting man just having a wank to something.

I'm currently 24 and I’ve been thinking about these sorts of things ever since I was around 13/14, when I went through puberty. I was generally a normal child, and didn’t do anything or was interested in anything girly when I was younger, and my mind thinks, ""You can’t be a trans person, because they all know it when they're younger!"" and ""it’s just a sexual fetish"" but then I keep thinking the same thing. I just want to be a girl. 

So these feelings have been going on for nigh on a decade now, which has now become most of my life, my mind has wondered, both during masturbation and on non-sexual thoughts about how I’d be happier as a girl. How I’d want to be looked after by a guy or girl, I’d want to feel the hole between my legs and the boobs on my chest. I’d dye my hair, get a piercing or get a tattoo. I'd dress nice, buy nice clothes and I’d make myself look pretty just because I could. I’d go on dates, fall in love and eventually become a mother, and I’d be happy.  As I came out the float tank today the room was full of ladies conditioners, and so on, so I washed and conditioned my hair with girl’s things, and for a short time it felt amazing. As I guy I have no real interest in doing any of these things at all, but I wish I was a girl so I could feel comfortable doing so. 

I've cross-dressed before, but found it lacking, I’ve played with anal play, with tampons and so on but again found it lacking. I've always felt like some pervy guy just looking weird, but I feel that it would be much better if I could do these things in my everyday life. 

I have a girlfriend, and I’m happy with her and I love her. Sometimes we have fairly normal and fun sex and I love it, it’s great. But sometimes, especially when she jumps on top, I imagine that she's the guy and she's fucking me, that she has me on my back and I find it amazing. I want to feel that so badly.

I worry that it’s just a sexual fetish sort of thing, I’m not really Trans, and it’s all about sex! But then I look at girls, and look past how pretty they are and start to feel jealous, or wish I was them, or just admire their clothes. Then I think to myself I’m only thinking about these things because I want to convince myself it’s not just a fetish of mine.

I don’t think a day goes by without it cropping up in my head, ""I wish I was a girl"" but I deal with it. I don’t get depressed over it, and I’m fairly accepting on myself as a man. I don’t like everything about it but some stuff is pretty damn cool. But I still feel again that I’d be happier as this girl, or at least the image of one I have in my head. I've looked into hormones, and I’ve looked at pictures of people going through the process and read their stories. I've seen the good ones and the bad ones, and I’ve thought the good ones look so beautiful, but the bad ones just look like men. I don’t think I could ever go through the process myself because I’m terrified of ending up looking terrible. But I also say, what’s the point? I've missed out on the best stuff already, growing up as a girl, getting to be young and free. I'd probably lose my whole family, my job, some friends and my girlfriend if I decided to go through with the actual change, so I know that I never will, because I want to be 100% girl, or nothing. 

I read sci-fi books, like the culture series where they can change gender at will, and I’m so incredibly jealous of that, but it makes me optimistic for the future. I can’t wait for that possibility to happen in my lifetime. Whether it’s VR, body swapping, perfect surgery or whatever does come, I can’t wait and I hope so madly and badly that I can become that 100% a woman, feel what she feels and live my life the way I want. But I know I could never do it now. And then my mind starts to think, does that mean I’m not Trans? I think about death from time to time, and earlier depression when I was younger, including a failed suicide attempt, may have been brought on partially by all these thoughts and feelings. I'm not sure. I hope so badly and want to believe in reincarnation, just so I can grow up and be the woman I want to be.

I honestly just don’t know what goes on in my head anymore, but this single thought runs around my head, it gets in there every day and for the last 10 years, it’s rarely been absent.

""I want to be a woman""

I just wish I knew whether it was real or not.

TL DR - I'm so fucking confused.

I was never ""one of the guys"" when I was growing up.  I was always pretty big for my age, and much stronger than the average kid, but when they stuck me on the football team I ended up getting run over more often than not.  I just didn't have the aggression for it I suppose.  I'd always been more of a writer than anything else, so I stuck with what I knew, left the team, and continued writing and making short films throughout high school.  My relatives wrung their hands and blessed my little misguided heart (I'm a southerner, for reference) because a boy my size really should be playing football, not hanging out with those girls in the literature club.  That sort of thing would turn me gay, they insisted to my mom, but luckily she let me continue to do what I always had.  I had a couple of relationships during this time, but nothing ever really panned out and I ended up leaving the dating scene for the better part of a decade.  It was during this time that I really started questioning my own sexuality.  I kept falling for tomboyish girls, who more often than not ended up being lesbians (go figure).  My lack of success in this realm eventually led me to accept my fate as that really atypical dude who'd always be single.  I'd experienced attraction to some guys as well, but I kept that under my hat, as that's not the sort of thing that gets discussed over the post-church Sunday dinner in these parts.

Fast forward a few years, and I'm coming up on graduation at MTSU  (I entered college late, so at this point I was 27).  I was still single, the long bout of relationships seemingly torpedoed by my own oddity having continued unabated, but one night I met the most wonderful person in existence.  She was short, dark skinned, short hair, and  her ears were gauged.  She was wearing a button down shirt and a black tie, along with a pair of artfully shredded jeans (I still remember that night in a great deal of detail, even though it was nearly a year ago). 

The short version is that I fell for her then and there.  The long version however, is that I just assumed that it wouldn't work, and did my best to ignore the fact that I was falling for this beautiful person who had  suddenly entered my life, and after this had gone on for a couple of months, much to my surprise, *she* started pursuing *me*.

After we had dated for a few months, she dropped the ultimate bombshell on me while she was on her way home from out of town (she did it via text, because she had been afraid of how I might react).  She had gender identity issues, and most of the time was more comfortable in the role of a guy than that of a girl.

After a long pause, I responded that I had no problem at all with that, and after giving it some more thought, I added that I wasn't exactly the most masculine guy in the world anyway, and that was more at home taking care of kids, baking things, the sort of roles that society deems as stereotypically feminine.

So that brings me back to where I am now.  I'm not sure that I technically qualify as genderqueer.  My SO likes to bend a bit more than me appearance wise, and she is also pan.  As far as I go, well, she's perfectly my type, and although I'm bald and bearded, I'm still not the most masculine [looking](http://i.imgur.com/T9gFOQx.jpg) guy in the world.

Although our relationship is pretty unconventional by pretty much any standard, we're embracing each others weirdness with a gusto that most couples can only dream of.  She's going to keep wearing her beat up old military jacket and cutting her hair short. I'm going to keep carrying my man-purse around and running around the kitchen in a flowery apron, and that works perfectly for both of us.",genderqueer,Not too sure what to call myself actually.,1370139087.0,"{'created_utc': 1370113887, 'id': '1fh70t', 'num_comments': 9, 'score': 24, 'selftext': 'Well, here I am.

The long version however, is that I just assumed that it wouldn\'t work, and did my best to ignore the fact that I was falling for this beautiful person who had  suddenly entered my life, and after this had gone on for a couple of months, much to my surprise, *she* started pursuing *me*.\n\nAfter we had dated for a few months, she dropped the ultimate bombshell on me while she was on her way home from out of town (she did it via text, because she had been afraid of how I might react).  She had gender identity issues, and most of the time was more comfortable in the role of a guy than that of a girl.\n\nAfter a long pause, I responded that I had no problem at all with that, and after giving it some more thought, I added that I wasn\'t exactly the most masculine guy in the world anyway, and that was more at home taking care of kids, baking things, the sort of roles that society deems as stereotypically feminine.\n\nSo that brings me back to where I am now.  I\'m not sure that I technically qualify as genderqueer.  My SO likes to bend a bit more than me appearance wise, and she is also pan.  As far as I go, well, she\'s perfectly my type, and although I\'m bald and bearded, I\'m still not the most masculine [looking](http://i.imgur.com/T9gFOQx.jpg) guy in the world.\n\nAlthough our relationship is pretty unconventional by pretty much any standard, we\'re embracing each others weirdness with a gusto that most couples can only dream of.  She\'s going to keep wearing her beat up old military jacket and cutting her hair short. I\'m going to keep carrying my man-purse around and running around the kitchen in a flowery apron, and that works perfectly for both of us.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Not too sure what to call myself actually.', 'created': 1370139087.0}",

A couple weeks ago this thought suddenly struck me for the first time and this question has been on my mind since. I can't believe it's only recently occurred to me what it really means to strongly identify with a particular gender.

I'm pansexual, biologically female, look cisgendered, haven't experienced gender dysphoria as far as I'm aware, and its recently starting to register more on my mind that I have never felt strongly about my gender at all. It only recently really hit me that this might be uncommon. All my life, I've never strongly identified as female. I just felt like I am female the same as I just have black hair. To me I don't really associate any sort of *feeling* with *being* a woman. I just acknowledge that I am seen as such by most people. But on a personal level, I've never felt strongly defined by, or a strong sense of belonging to the term ""woman"", nor have I felt this way toward the term ""man"".

I feel like the only thing that separates me from most tomboyish women is the fact that if I woke up tomorrow with male genitals, no breasts, and a voice that's gone through puberty, I think I'd be okay with it. The thought in the title occurred to me one day when I was asking myself questions to sort out how I really felt about my own gender. I asked myself, ""how would I feel if I woke up a man tomorrow"", and then I thought ""what does it mean to 'feel' like a man or a woman?"" I can try and guess how I might feel if I was almost always assumed to be a man and my body looked more male with male sex organs. I'm pretty sure my preference for presenting androgynously wouldn't necessarily change just because my body would.

I don't identify strongly as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine, but I do wonder what it feels like to strongly identify with a particular gender. And I guess I say ""strongly"" for lack of a better term, because when you've never identified with any gender, any level of association seems a bit ""strong"". Do most people actually *feel* like a man or a woman? I know that the majority of society, including within the LGBTQ community, probably do identify more strongly with gender than I do. What does that feel like? What does being a particular gender mean to you, and how important do you feel it is in your perception of yourself? How does feeling a sense of identity in a certain gender affect your behavior socially?

Sorry for the barrage of questions, and I know the main question does not apply only to genderqueer people nor does it apply to all genderqueer people, but I don't know of a better place to ask it. I feel like most people wouldn't know what it feels like to *not* strongly identify with any gender, so they might find it difficult to explain how they *do* strongly identify with it. Perhaps you fine folks can share your thoughts on these questions?

14,2013-06-05 18:51:24,1fql6l,17,14,"So a couple weeks ago I began a little dalliance with this straight cis guy. It has been great fun. But yesterday I told him I was genderqueer and he does. not. get it. I've been trying to explain why it matters that he respect my gender and it's not working. I want to keep trying because he's not being purposefully hateful, just super ignorant. I'll give the highlights from his point of view so you can see what I mean (he's not a native English speaker so some of it might read a little oddly):


""For me you are just UnicornPower420, when I see you I dont think of you as a girl but just as UnicornPower420. Of course for me it does matter that you are a girl because i am not attracted to men but i don't see you as a girl constantly. Me not wanting to call you they or she or whatever you like is because i dont see any point in it, i enjoyed hanging around with you and having fun with you regardless of any personal pronouns. I respect that you feel different from others, and please dont say i dont because i am truthfull to my word but why should we dwell on such a difference of perception. I see you as a girl, you don't see it that way and i respect you for that but don't force me to do things which i don't believe in. I mean, I could bullshit you and say that I am totally comfortable with calling you they but i'm just not. I don't understand why you lose your respect for me when i am trying to be honest towards you. Having respect for each other doesn't mean you should totally understand each other but you let the other live his life like he wants too without inteference or at least it does for me.""


I told him to imagine he was saying those things about my orientation instead of my gender, e.g. even though I think of myself as bi he thinks of me as straight and I have to respect that, in the hopes that the analogy would make the issue make more sense, but it didn't seem to work. I even conceded that he didn't have to use my pronouns or be a decent ally or anything, just try to be understanding. I also told him that he's trying to put me in a closet to make himself more comfortable and that's shitty. That seems to have made him defensive.


""What I understand from your message is that you don't feel comfortable being around me while knowing that I think of you as a girl. I am not uncomfortable about your mixed feeling about your gender and i acknowledge it. I never said that you should act as a girl because i want you to. I only said that i perceive you as a girl and for me you are one.""


I don't even with this last part though:
""But having hurt feelings doesn't give you the moral high ground. I feel you are making no effort at all to see my point of view, your stuck in a loop of i am hurt and your wrong and you have to change. Don't you see that you are doing the same thing to me as you are accusing me of. You have seen a side of me that doesn't appeal to you and you immediately start talking about breaking things off. Well to be honest i have seen i side of you that didn't appeal to me directly but you let the other be because that is what you do around people, you give and take because you enjoy being around them so you forget about their less appealing sides. I am just not all pro transgender, not against it in any way but you won't see me standing on the barricades waving the rainbow flag. That is just the way it is, there are probably things i feel strongly about and you don't. But I'll give you all the room you need to give outing to your gender but don't expect from me that i become just as passionate about it as you. In a way you are doing the same thing as the anti-transgender people. You are like the believer who doesn't want to hear anything else then what appeals to his believes. You get shocked and upset when you find out that not all people share the same opinions on things. Well that is life, there are probably tons of people who don't like me or my opinions but it is there right to do so. Difference is what makes the world go around. This doesn't mean that transgenders should be beat up because there different but it also doesn't mean that everyone should agree with them. I always had a great time hanging out with you so why should we get stuck on this subject.

It has been great fun. But yesterday I told him I was genderqueer and he does. not. get it. I\'ve been trying to explain why it matters that he respect my gender and it\'s not working. I want to keep trying because he\'s not being purposefully hateful, just super ignorant. I\'ll give the highlights from his point of view so you can see what I mean (he\'s not a native English speaker so some of it might read a little oddly):\n\n\n""For me you are just UnicornPower420, when I see you I dont think of you as a girl but just as UnicornPower420. Of course for me it does matter that you are a girl because i am not attracted to men but i don\'t see you as a girl constantly. Me not wanting to call you they or she or whatever you like is because i dont see any point in it, i enjoyed hanging around with you and having fun with you regardless of any personal pronouns. I respect that you feel different from others, and please dont say i dont because i am truthfull to my word but why should we dwell on such a difference of perception. I see you as a girl, you don\'t see it that way and i respect you for that but don\'t force me to do things which i don\'t believe in. I mean, I could bullshit you and say that I am totally comfortable with calling you they but i\'m just not. I don\'t understand why you lose your respect for me when i am trying to be honest towards you. Having respect for each other doesn\'t mean you should totally understand each other but you let the other live his life like he wants too without inteference or at least it does for me.""\n\n\nI told him to imagine he was saying those things about my orientation instead of my gender, e.g. even though I think of myself as bi he thinks of me as straight and I have to respect that, in the hopes that the analogy would make the issue make more sense, but it didn\'t seem to work. I even conceded that he didn\'t have to use my pronouns or be a decent ally or anything, just try to be understanding. I also told him that he\'s trying to put me in a closet to make himself more comfortable and that\'s shitty. That seems to have made him defensive.\n\n\n""What I understand from your message is that you don\'t feel comfortable being around me while knowing that I think of you as a girl. I am not uncomfortable about your mixed feeling about your gender and i acknowledge it. I never said that you should act as a girl because i want you to. I only said that i perceive you as a girl and for me you are one.""\n\n\nI don\'t even with this last part though:\n""But having hurt feelings doesn\'t give you the moral high ground. I feel you are making no effort at all to see my point of view, your stuck in a loop of i am hurt and your wrong and you have to change. Don\'t you see that you are doing the same thing to me as you are accusing me of. You have seen a side of me that doesn\'t appeal to you and you immediately start talking about breaking things off. Well to be honest i have seen i side of you that didn\'t appeal to me directly but you let the other be because that is what you do around people, you give and take because you enjoy being around them so you forget about their less appealing sides. I am just not all pro transgender, not against it in any way but you won\'t see me standing on the barricades waving the rainbow flag. That is just the way it is, there are probably things i feel strongly about and you don\'t. But I\'ll give you all the room you need to give outing to your gender but don\'t expect from me that i become just as passionate about it as you. In a way you are doing the same thing as the anti-transgender people. You are like the believer who doesn\'t want to hear anything else then what appeals to his believes. You get shocked and upset when you find out that not all people share the same opinions on things. Well that is life, there are probably tons of people who don\'t like me or my opinions but it is there right to do so. Difference is what makes the world go around. This doesn\'t mean that transgenders should be beat up because there different but it also doesn\'t mean that everyone should agree with them. I always had a great time hanging out with you so why should we get stuck on this subject. I understand that being transgender is a major part of you and again i respect that side of you but also leave room for me to have my own opinions.

I have no interest in transitioning as I am usually comfortable with my body. On the days that I am not, I wish I wasn't male but I don't want to be female.

I see myself as feminine but NOT female

Out of convenience and some necessity I present as male (not masculine)

Aside from outward appearances, I do NOT see myself as male in any way

I value gender neutrality in communication as my chosen name (soon to be legal) is neutral as are my pronouns.

I have tried to figure this out on my own. From other people I have asked elsewhere, I keep getting told I am maybe bigender or genderfluid but everything I see about what those are just seems wrong for me. Neutrois sounded plausible or gender-neutral as an identity. If I could choose what I ""wanted"" to be, it would be a neutral gender. Otherwise, right now I really have no clue.

I keep realizing that I want more boob to work with though... I can't wait till I can get the bra and underwear I ordered...  Anywho, I wore the tights yesterday and didn't shave my legs and it felt totally wrong, sooooo today after ultimate frisbee (which is kinda annoying because what gender you are is frequently referenced when playing for things like who you're matched up against) I came home and showered and shaved my legs and chest and armpits. Then my friend came over and I wore jeans to hide it... but on thursday I've got frisbee again and wearing shorts it's gonna be obvious my legs are hairless now. \n\nIm not entirely worried... I'll just say something about gender fluidity and they'll completely not get it and just think I'm a little bit weirder. I honestly wonder how much they already suspect it anyways... \n\nAnyways, I'll post pictures at some point in the future...

72,2013-06-26 09:36:29,1h3kip,8,13,"So I am wondering what I should do. 

I am a 21 year old born a girl. When I was eleven I was going to go to another school and really, really wanted to go as a boy. I never fit in with girls (or, for the matter, anyone, ha.) I never did girly things. Never did barbies, tree houses instead.

I thought it was nothing for a while; just kept on being my own self. Kinda weird, didn't fit in, did my own thing.

Now I'm almost 22 and I think that I might be experiencing actual dysphoria. I hate the fact that I have big hips and boobs. I'm pretty tall and lanky, and I used to be really skinny... and since I dress in pretty androgynous clothing (usually a button down shirt and skinny jeans) when I was skinny I was mistaken for a boy a lot. 

Half of the time I feel more like a gay boy than a straight girl. I think that I'd rather be a boy, and I really don't like that I have the attributes that I do. 

However, I don't buy into gender binaries. If I really am a boy at heart, I am a really feminine one. I do like to wear dresses on occasion. Maybe once or twice a year. But most of the time, it's short hair, flannel shirt, skinny jeans, boy shoes. 

I'm really quite okay with the way that I present myself. I like who I am. I kinda hate my body, though. 

I have been in a relationship with a boy for a year and half now. I'll admit that a part of the reason why I like him is because he's never fit the ""masculine"" norm - he has a bit of a high voice, he cares about his looks, he even has a big crush on a male celebrity or two... I've always felt that we work so well together because I am a masculine girl and he is a feminine boy. The only other boy I loved, actually, thought that he was gay but decided that he was bisexual. Or pansexual. I dunno. 

I still don't often make friends with girls. I prefer boys, but mostly if they're gay or if they're in any way... not completely masculine. 

I really do think that I am not the identity I currently use. I am not a girl. I'm not a boy, either. I've never had anyone (or any internet thing) to talk about this to before. I'd really appreciate some input, even if it's just some validation. I had a roommate once who was FTM but later decided he felt more androgynous... but we never breached to my situation. 

I really, really want to bring this situation up to my SO. I am already working on losing the weight I gained that makes me look so feminine. I want to buy a binder, too, though, which is obviously something he will notice. I have brought it up in hints but nothing that warrants a real reply. Once in reply to an assertion that I like spooning him rather than vice versa he did say that it would be better for him if I had a penis, but I couldn't tell if he was joking. Ugh.

79,2013-06-29 03:01:29,1hahg4,8,7,"Okay so here is my deal. 

Not too long ago, I figured out that maybe (and by maybe I mean yeah totally entirely) guys weren’t my cup-o-tea. I was and am cool with that. So are the people I care about. Everyone has been supper supportive and it’s all been rainbows and butterflies…mostly rainbows though.

A little while after that, I started feeling weird about myself. That is the best was I can describe it. Just weird. An uncomfortable dust seemed to cling to my reflection whenever I looked in the mirror. 

I started to dress more masculine, cut off my hair, started wearing men’s clothes, so on and so forth. I felt better for a while, about a month? I never really thought it could be a gender thing. I just sort of took it as, “You’re just becoming your inner butch now that you’re allowed to be one.""

But(t) then dressing masculine wasn’t enough…I ditched the traditional bra for a sports. When I wore it, I looked almost entirely like a dude and loved it. I pitched my voice a little lower and started carrying myself like a man. It made me happy,

BUTT THEN I started feeling like shit about presenting masculine! I felt wrong still, so I went uber femme. I was happy again. I was a girl, absolutely sure of it… and a damn fierce femme girly girl at that.

Now…I don’t know…I get up, look in the mirror and my heart feels like it’s being smushed. I feel like a girl but also like a man. I get in the shower and want to die because I have lady bits and half of me is okay with that but the other half wants to chop them off and the third stronger part wants to be a worm so I don’t have to have any bits at all. 

I feel like a crazy person because I nearly cry trying to figure out what clothes to put on. A dress? No, that is wrong and make my chest feel all tight. A button up? nono get off me I want to crawl out of my skin. 

Hell, It isn’t even really the clothes that are bugging me. I’m okay flipping a giant middle finger to gender norms and dressing however the fuck I want. It isn’t about not liking dresses or men’s clothes. It’s so much deeper than that. I could easily identify as a chick and dress both femme and manish if that was it. 

Nothing feels right inside too. I feel like I’m caught between man and woman, even though I know there are so many more options than that. . I never thought gender could be such a huge deal. I use to just sort of shrug at the idea. Sure whatever, be what you want and lets move on.

Now, I don’t know what to do with myself…I feel ill in my body. I can’t be okay with who I am anymore. Just thinking about it makes me want to puke.

I don’t feel like a man. But I do. I don’t feel like a woman. But I do. I feel like both and neither. 

Is this gender queer? If so how the hell am I supposed to live like this??

I don’t know…I keep hoping one day I’ll wake up and know. I’ll be able to look at my crotch and say Yes or No. 

In short, screw diddly do gender, I want to be a slug. 

I've been lurking here for a while and decided I could try and ask for some advice or at least sympathy. Thanks for taking the time to read my post. You rock.

I feel like I’m caught between man and woman, even though I know there are so many more options than that. . I never thought gender could be such a huge deal. I use to just sort of shrug at the idea. Sure whatever, be what you want and lets move on.\n\nNow, I don’t know what to do with myself…I feel ill in my body. I can’t be okay with who I am anymore.

I was never ""one of the guys"" when I was growing up.  I was always pretty big for my age, and much stronger than the average kid, but when they stuck me on the football team I ended up getting run over more often than not.  I just didn't have the aggression for it I suppose.  I'd always been more of a writer than anything else, so I stuck with what I knew, left the team, and continued writing and making short films throughout high school.  My relatives wrung their hands and blessed my little misguided heart (I'm a southerner, for reference) because a boy my size really should be playing football, not hanging out with those girls in the literature club.  That sort of thing would turn me gay, they insisted to my mom, but luckily she let me continue to do what I always had.  I had a couple of relationships during this time, but nothing ever really panned out and I ended up leaving the dating scene for the better part of a decade.  It was during this time that I really started questioning my own sexuality.  I kept falling for tomboyish girls, who more often than not ended up being lesbians (go figure).  My lack of success in this realm eventually led me to accept my fate as that really atypical dude who'd always be single.  I'd experienced attraction to some guys as well, but I kept that under my hat, as that's not the sort of thing that gets discussed over the post-church Sunday dinner in these parts.

Fast forward a few years, and I'm coming up on graduation at MTSU  (I entered college late, so at this point I was 27).  I was still single, the long bout of relationships seemingly torpedoed by my own oddity having continued unabated, but one night I met the most wonderful person in existence.  She was short, dark skinned, short hair, and  her ears were gauged.  She was wearing a button down shirt and a black tie, along with a pair of artfully shredded jeans (I still remember that night in a great deal of detail, even though it was nearly a year ago). 

The short version is that I fell for her then and there.  The long version however, is that I just assumed that it wouldn't work, and did my best to ignore the fact that I was falling for this beautiful person who had  suddenly entered my life, and after this had gone on for a couple of months, much to my surprise, *she* started pursuing *me*.

After we had dated for a few months, she dropped the ultimate bombshell on me while she was on her way home from out of town (she did it via text, because she had been afraid of how I might react).  She had gender identity issues, and most of the time was more comfortable in the role of a guy than that of a girl.

After a long pause, I responded that I had no problem at all with that, and after giving it some more thought, I added that I wasn't exactly the most masculine guy in the world anyway, and that was more at home taking care of kids, baking things, the sort of roles that society deems as stereotypically feminine.

So that brings me back to where I am now.  I'm not sure that I technically qualify as genderqueer.  My SO likes to bend a bit more than me appearance wise, and she is also pan.  As far as I go, well, she's perfectly my type, and although I'm bald and bearded, I'm still not the most masculine [looking](http://i.imgur.com/T9gFOQx.jpg) guy in the world.

Although our relationship is pretty unconventional by pretty much any standard, we're embracing each others weirdness with a gusto that most couples can only dream of.

A couple weeks ago this thought suddenly struck me for the first time and this question has been on my mind since. I can't believe it's only recently occurred to me what it really means to strongly identify with a particular gender.

I'm pansexual, biologically female, look cisgendered, haven't experienced gender dysphoria as far as I'm aware, and its recently starting to register more on my mind that I have never felt strongly about my gender at all. It only recently really hit me that this might be uncommon. All my life, I've never strongly identified as female. I just felt like I am female the same as I just have black hair. To me I don't really associate any sort of *feeling* with *being* a woman. I just acknowledge that I am seen as such by most people. But on a personal level, I've never felt strongly defined by, or a strong sense of belonging to the term ""woman"", nor have I felt this way toward the term ""man"".

I feel like the only thing that separates me from most tomboyish women is the fact that if I woke up tomorrow with male genitals, no breasts, and a voice that's gone through puberty, I think I'd be okay with it. The thought in the title occurred to me one day when I was asking myself questions to sort out how I really felt about my own gender. I asked myself, ""how would I feel if I woke up a man tomorrow"", and then I thought ""what does it mean to 'feel' like a man or a woman?"" I can try and guess how I might feel if I was almost always assumed to be a man and my body looked more male with male sex organs. I'm pretty sure my preference for presenting androgynously wouldn't necessarily change just because my body would.

I don't identify strongly as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine, but I do wonder what it feels like to strongly identify with a particular gender. And I guess I say ""strongly"" for lack of a better term, because when you've never identified with any gender, any level of association seems a bit ""strong"". Do most people actually *feel* like a man or a woman? I know that the majority of society, including within the LGBTQ community, probably do identify more strongly with gender than I do. What does that feel like? What does being a particular gender mean to you, and how important do you feel it is in your perception of yourself? How does feeling a sense of identity in a certain gender affect your behavior socially?

Sorry for the barrage of questions, and I know the main question does not apply only to genderqueer people nor does it apply to all genderqueer people, but I don't know of a better place to ask it. I feel like most people wouldn't know what it feels like to *not* strongly identify with any gender, so they might find it difficult to explain how they *do* strongly identify with it.

Of course, half of the people I\'ve said anything to had no idea that there\'s a difference between gender and sex, and they certainly didn\'t know what ""genderqueer"" was, so it kinda just went in one ear and out the other.... \n\nAnyways, does anyone have any advice?

I'm not sure what I expect to gain by posting it here, advice? Someone to tell me that they feel the same? Someone to tell me it’s all rubbish? I really don’t know. Being in the float tank has relaxed me in a way that has helped me write all this down for the first time. That's why I'm sharing it now. *&lt;/preface&gt;

So today I went to a floatation tank. I've always wanted to go into one as I've loved the idea of no physical input, and being able to relax and destress totally. It brought on this stream of consciousness, which has turned into almost every thought and feeling I’ve had for years now. It can get kind of graphic in parts. 

But during that pretty amazing experience, my mind went where it always goes when I’m relaxed, or have nothing else to think about.
It went to the woman. That woman inside that I think about and wish I could be. That woman who I’m not sure even exists.

During my float, when all the itches and niggles started to fade away, I started to think. I started to imagine myself as this girl, this young girl, a teenager sitting outside with her boyfriend, and for the first time they kissed, I kissed him, and it was wonderful. That kissing started to get more urgent, both in a physical sense in that I started to imagine that more was happening, some stroking, some touching, but also the mental need that I wanted him. I wanted him to love me and I wanted to feel loved. I wanted that so badly. Things went further and we started having sex, and I wanted it so badly, I wanted to feel him inside me, and I wanted to feel loved by him. This was what I was feeling both as the girl I was imagining, but also as the man inside the tank. As things went further and further this mental and physical feeling built up and up until my body felt full of energy, it felt like an orgasm I’ve never felt before, and it spread throughout my whole body. My toes tingled, and curled into small balls, and my back arched in the air as this feeling built up and up into it just exploded, and I felt as relaxed as I ever could be, with this warm feeling just slowly fading away. 
I desperately wanted to be this woman, and hated the fact that this little experience was over.
I don’t know exactly what I felt, because I’m not sure I’ve ever felt it before, but it felt good all the same. I thought at the time that was I arching my back because that’s how women orgasm? Or is it because I’ve seen that in porn/my own real life girlfriend before? Did that feeling come about because it’s what I’ve heard the female orgasm feel like? My mind then starts to wonder and I start to think if I’m just thinking all of this for my own pleasure, is it a fetish that I like the idea of being a woman? Or does it go deeper? 

I have on many occasions masturbated to the idea of being a woman, but this time in the tank it felt much deeper, perhaps because it was easier to imagine that I was her, and not just some sweaty disgusting man just having a wank to something.

I'm currently 24 and I’ve been thinking about these sorts of things ever since I was around 13/14, when I went through puberty. I was generally a normal child, and didn’t do anything or was interested in anything girly when I was younger, and my mind thinks, ""You can’t be a trans person, because they all know it when they're younger!"" and ""it’s just a sexual fetish"" but then I keep thinking the same thing. I just want to be a girl. 

So these feelings have been going on for nigh on a decade now, which has now become most of my life, my mind has wondered, both during masturbation and on non-sexual thoughts about how I’d be happier as a girl. How I’d want to be looked after by a guy or girl, I’d want to feel the hole between my legs and the boobs on my chest. I’d dye my hair, get a piercing or get a tattoo. I'd dress nice, buy nice clothes and I’d make myself look pretty just because I could. I’d go on dates, fall in love and eventually become a mother, and I’d be happy.  As I came out the float tank today the room was full of ladies conditioners, and so on, so I washed and conditioned my hair with girl’s things, and for a short time it felt amazing. As I guy I have no real interest in doing any of these things at all, but I wish I was a girl so I could feel comfortable doing so. 

I've cross-dressed before, but found it lacking, I’ve played with anal play, with tampons and so on but again found it lacking. I've always felt like some pervy guy just looking weird, but I feel that it would be much better if I could do these things in my everyday life. 

I have a girlfriend, and I’m happy with her and I love her. Sometimes we have fairly normal and fun sex and I love it, it’s great. But sometimes, especially when she jumps on top, I imagine that she's the guy and she's fucking me, that she has me on my back and I find it amazing. I want to feel that so badly.

I worry that it’s just a sexual fetish sort of thing, I’m not really Trans, and it’s all about sex! But then I look at girls, and look past how pretty they are and start to feel jealous, or wish I was them, or just admire their clothes. Then I think to myself I’m only thinking about these things because I want to convince myself it’s not just a fetish of mine.

I don’t think a day goes by without it cropping up in my head, ""I wish I was a girl"" but I deal with it. I don’t get depressed over it, and I’m fairly accepting on myself as a man. I don’t like everything about it but some stuff is pretty damn cool. But I still feel again that I’d be happier as this girl, or at least the image of one I have in my head. I've looked into hormones, and I’ve looked at pictures of people going through the process and read their stories. I've seen the good ones and the bad ones, and I’ve thought the good ones look so beautiful, but the bad ones just look like men. I don’t think I could ever go through the process myself because I’m terrified of ending up looking terrible. But I also say, what’s the point? I've missed out on the best stuff already, growing up as a girl, getting to be young and free. I'd probably lose my whole family, my job, some friends and my girlfriend if I decided to go through with the actual change, so I know that I never will, because I want to be 100% girl, or nothing. 

I read sci-fi books, like the culture series where they can change gender at will, and I’m so incredibly jealous of that, but it makes me optimistic for the future. I can’t wait for that possibility to happen in my lifetime. Whether it’s VR, body swapping, perfect surgery or whatever does come, I can’t wait and I hope so madly and badly that I can become that 100% a woman, feel what she feels and live my life the way I want. But I know I could never do it now. And then my mind starts to think, does that mean I’m not Trans? I think about death from time to time, and earlier depression when I was younger, including a failed suicide attempt, may have been brought on partially by all these thoughts and feelings. I'm not sure. I hope so badly and want to believe in reincarnation, just so I can grow up and be the woman I want to be.

I honestly just don’t know what goes on in my head anymore, but this single thought runs around my head, it gets in there every day and for the last 10 years, it’s rarely been absent.

""I want to be a woman""

I just wish I knew whether it was real or not.

Then I think to myself I’m only thinking about these things because I want to convince myself it’s not just a fetish of mine.\n\nI don’t think a day goes by without it cropping up in my head, ""I wish I was a girl"" but I deal with it. I don’t get depressed over it, and I’m fairly accepting on myself as a man. I don’t like everything about it but some stuff is pretty damn cool. But I still feel again that I’d be happier as this girl, or at least the image of one I have in my head. I\'ve looked into hormones, and I’ve looked at pictures of people going through the process and read their stories. I\'ve seen the good ones and the bad ones, and I’ve thought the good ones look so beautiful, but the bad ones just look like men. I don’t think I could ever go through the process myself because I’m terrified of ending up looking terrible. But I also say, what’s the point? I\'ve missed out on the best stuff already, growing up as a girl, getting to be young and free. I\'d probably lose my whole family, my job, some friends and my girlfriend if I decided to go through with the actual change, so I know that I never will, because I want to be 100% girl, or nothing. \n\nI read sci-fi books, like the culture series where they can change gender at will, and I’m so incredibly jealous of that, but it makes me optimistic for the future. I can’t wait for that possibility to happen in my lifetime. Whether it’s VR, body swapping, perfect surgery or whatever does come, I can’t wait and I hope so madly and badly that I can become that 100% a woman, feel what she feels and live my life the way I want. But I know I could never do it now. And then my mind starts to think, does that mean I’m not Trans? I think about death from time to time, and earlier depression when I was younger, including a failed suicide attempt, may have been brought on partially by all these thoughts and feelings. I\'m not sure. I hope so badly and want to believe in reincarnation, just so I can grow up and be the woman I want to be.\n\nI honestly just don’t know what goes on in my head anymore, but this single thought runs around my head, it gets in there every day and for the last 10 years, it’s rarely been absent.\n\n""I want to be a woman""\n\nI just wish I knew whether it was real or not.\n\nTL DR - I\'m so fucking confused.\n', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'So today I went to a floatation tank.... 10 years of thoughts and feelings.', 'created': 1370464332.0}",8.0

I want to keep trying because he's not being purposefully hateful, just super ignorant.

Of course for me it does matter that you are a girl because i am not attracted to men but i don't see you as a girl constantly.

I respect that you feel different from others, and please dont say i dont because i am truthfull to my word but why should we dwell on such a difference of perception. I see you as a girl, you don't see it that way and i respect you for that but don't force me to do things which i don't believe in. I mean, I could bullshit you and say that I am totally comfortable with calling you they but i'm just not. I don't understand why you lose your respect for me when i am trying to be honest towards you. Having respect for each other doesn't mean you should totally understand each other but you let the other live his life like he wants too without inteference or at least it does for me.""


I told him to imagine he was saying those things about my orientation instead of my gender, e.g. even though I think of myself as bi he thinks of me as straight and I have to respect that, in the hopes that the analogy would make the issue make more sense, but it didn't seem to work. I even conceded that he didn't have to use my pronouns or be a decent ally or anything, just try to be understanding. I also told him that he's trying to put me in a closet to make himself more comfortable and that's shitty. That seems to have made him defensive.


""What I understand from your message is that you don't feel comfortable being around me while knowing that I think of you as a girl. I am not uncomfortable about your mixed feeling about your gender and i acknowledge it. I never said that you should act as a girl because i want you to.

Don't you see that you are doing the same thing to me as you are accusing me of. You have seen a side of me that doesn't appeal to you and you immediately start talking about breaking things off. Well to be honest i have seen i side of you that didn't appeal to me directly but you let the other be because that is what you do around people, you give and take because you enjoy being around them so you forget about their less appealing sides. I am just not all pro transgender, not against it in any way but you won't see me standing on the barricades waving the rainbow flag. That is just the way it is, there are probably things i feel strongly about and you don't. But I'll give you all the room you need to give outing to your gender but don't expect from me that i become just as passionate about it as you. In a way you are doing the same thing as the anti-transgender people. You are like the believer who doesn't want to hear anything else then what appeals to his believes.

I see myself as feminine but NOT female

Out of convenience and some necessity I present as male (not masculine)

Aside from outward appearances, I do NOT see myself as male in any way

I value gender neutrality in communication as my chosen name (soon to be legal) is neutral as are my pronouns.

I have tried to figure this out on my own.

119,2013-06-26 09:36:29,1h3kip,8,13,"So I am wondering what I should do. 

I am a 21 year old born a girl. When I was eleven I was going to go to another school and really, really wanted to go as a boy. I never fit in with girls (or, for the matter, anyone, ha.) I never did girly things. Never did barbies, tree houses instead.

I thought it was nothing for a while; just kept on being my own self. Kinda weird, didn't fit in, did my own thing.

Now I'm almost 22 and I think that I might be experiencing actual dysphoria. I hate the fact that I have big hips and boobs. I'm pretty tall and lanky, and I used to be really skinny... and since I dress in pretty androgynous clothing (usually a button down shirt and skinny jeans) when I was skinny I was mistaken for a boy a lot. 

Half of the time I feel more like a gay boy than a straight girl. I think that I'd rather be a boy, and I really don't like that I have the attributes that I do. 

However, I don't buy into gender binaries. If I really am a boy at heart, I am a really feminine one. I do like to wear dresses on occasion. Maybe once or twice a year. But most of the time, it's short hair, flannel shirt, skinny jeans, boy shoes. 

I'm really quite okay with the way that I present myself. I like who I am. I kinda hate my body, though. 

I have been in a relationship with a boy for a year and half now. I'll admit that a part of the reason why I like him is because he's never fit the ""masculine"" norm - he has a bit of a high voice, he cares about his looks, he even has a big crush on a male celebrity or two... I've always felt that we work so well together because I am a masculine girl and he is a feminine boy. The only other boy I loved, actually, thought that he was gay but decided that he was bisexual. Or pansexual. I dunno. 

I still don't often make friends with girls. I prefer boys, but mostly if they're gay or if they're in any way... not completely masculine. 

I really do think that I am not the identity I currently use. I am not a girl. I'm not a boy, either. I've never had anyone (or any internet thing) to talk about this to before. I'd really appreciate some input, even if it's just some validation. I had a roommate once who was FTM but later decided he felt more androgynous... but we never breached to my situation. 

I really, really want to bring this situation up to my SO. I am already working on losing the weight I gained that makes me look so feminine. I want to buy a binder, too, though, which is obviously something he will notice. I have brought it up in hints but nothing that warrants a real reply. Once in reply to an assertion that I like spooning him rather than vice versa he did say that it would be better for him if I had a penis, but I couldn't tell if he was joking. Ugh.

130,2013-06-29 03:01:29,1hahg4,8,7,"Okay so here is my deal. 

Not too long ago, I figured out that maybe (and by maybe I mean yeah totally entirely) guys weren’t my cup-o-tea. I was and am cool with that. So are the people I care about. Everyone has been supper supportive and it’s all been rainbows and butterflies…mostly rainbows though.

A little while after that, I started feeling weird about myself. That is the best was I can describe it. Just weird. An uncomfortable dust seemed to cling to my reflection whenever I looked in the mirror. 

I started to dress more masculine, cut off my hair, started wearing men’s clothes, so on and so forth. I felt better for a while, about a month? I never really thought it could be a gender thing. I just sort of took it as, “You’re just becoming your inner butch now that you’re allowed to be one.""

But(t) then dressing masculine wasn’t enough…I ditched the traditional bra for a sports. When I wore it, I looked almost entirely like a dude and loved it. I pitched my voice a little lower and started carrying myself like a man. It made me happy,

BUTT THEN I started feeling like shit about presenting masculine! I felt wrong still, so I went uber femme. I was happy again. I was a girl, absolutely sure of it… and a damn fierce femme girly girl at that.

Now…I don’t know…I get up, look in the mirror and my heart feels like it’s being smushed. I feel like a girl but also like a man. I get in the shower and want to die because I have lady bits and half of me is okay with that but the other half wants to chop them off and the third stronger part wants to be a worm so I don’t have to have any bits at all. 

I feel like a crazy person because I nearly cry trying to figure out what clothes to put on. A dress? No, that is wrong and make my chest feel all tight. A button up? nono get off me I want to crawl out of my skin. 

Hell, It isn’t even really the clothes that are bugging me. I’m okay flipping a giant middle finger to gender norms and dressing however the fuck I want. It isn’t about not liking dresses or men’s clothes. It’s so much deeper than that. I could easily identify as a chick and dress both femme and manish if that was it. 

Nothing feels right inside too. I feel like I’m caught between man and woman, even though I know there are so many more options than that. . I never thought gender could be such a huge deal. I use to just sort of shrug at the idea. Sure whatever, be what you want and lets move on.

Now, I don’t know what to do with myself…I feel ill in my body. I can’t be okay with who I am anymore. Just thinking about it makes me want to puke.

I don’t feel like a man. But I do. I don’t feel like a woman. But I do. I feel like both and neither. 

Is this gender queer? If so how the hell am I supposed to live like this??

I don’t know…I keep hoping one day I’ll wake up and know. I’ll be able to look at my crotch and say Yes or No. 

In short, screw diddly do gender, I want to be a slug. 

I've been lurking here for a while and decided I could try and ask for some advice or at least sympathy. Thanks for taking the time to read my post. You rock.
