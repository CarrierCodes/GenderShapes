-My single very earliest memory is crossdressing with my sisters' dance costumes and loving it.

-Starting at age 5 I inexplicably wanted to transform into a girl and I would daydream about it all of the time

-The thoughts subsided during my elementary school years and I had a normal male childhood, but it came back full force at puberty

-The thoughts turned sexual in nature

-Began cross dressing

-To cope with my desire to transform into a girl, I compartmentalized my transgender feelings into sexual fantasies.

-I've never been able to sexually fantasize about being a man in a relationship with a woman, I've always had to be the woman. This led to immense frustrating trying to ""make the pieces fit,"" trying to force myself into the male role in heterosexual fantasies.

-I realized I had a huge problem at 18 and began therapy

-Psychiatrist has had me on every anti-depressant/anxiety in the book. Right now I'm on 4 (celexa, welbutrin, fanapt, and xanax)

-I've been to seven therapists. The gender therapist I saw for only 5 visits because I ran out of money, he seemed to think I was transgender.

-Depressed out of my mind. Not looking forward to anything in life, no hopes or dreams. Having panic attacks every night.

-At 20 I tried an HRT trial, but I got scared and was uncertain, so I quit after 20 days.

-Now at 21, the feelings feel unbearable being in a male body but having the desires to have a female body.

-Not trying to be crude, but to cope with my feelings, I have to sexually fantasize about being a woman multiple times a day just to get any relief.

-Binge eating to cope with my feelings, currently overweight

-I feel hopeless because these feelings are for life, there's no cure.

-Feels like I'm heading towards mental illness if I can't get my depression and anxiety and mental anguish under control.

-I'm considering trying another HRT trial, but I'm not sure how things will be different this time. I'm not sure how I would know if it was right for me. When I would know in my heart that it was for me.

16,2013-02-10 08:17:31,188mvz,8,3,"UPDATE: 

Results happened. 

I came out to my girlfriend sometime mid-October. 
I had been withdrawing from her, (a result of desperately trying to come up with a ""safe"" (lolz) way of telling her all of this... stuff) and she had started to suspect there might be another girl in my life. 

Only when she threatened to go stay in a hotel for a spell did I realise I had been well and truly backed into the corner I had hoped/expected I eventually would.

I sat her down (with berry cream cheese frosted cupcakes) and ... said it. ""I'm transgendered. I'm a woman.."" and the rest. I took it slow, i think. She listened, nodded, looking at me stonefaced.

It dawned on her slowly that I wasnt joking, and at that point it hit her like a ton of bricks. 
She disappeared to the bathroom, and after a few minutes I realised I should probably go check on her. 
And.. at this point I realised just how close I was to losing her. She was disgusted, infuriated, heartbroken. I think she actually said ""you broke my heart"". (A lot of this day is a blur. I'm okay with that, this isnt a day I want to remember really).

As the day went on, jokes were made, more tears were shed. There was vomiting (stress related, not the cupcakes), she went to the bedroom, asked me not to follow her. I passed out on the couch (and felt terrible for it, ""how does one have a nap at a time like this?!"" i thought, but... a stressful few weeks will do that) and by the evening we were cuddling on the couch. 

Since then, almost every day has been a struggle in its own right. 
Sometimes the struggle is all hers, battling with her dreams of our future, the possibility of what it might be now, whether she should just cut and run and try again with a man, or whether she can learn to be attracted to a woman... who used to be her Man. 

Sometimes the struggle is mine. The desire to start transitioning, the frustration in waiting (though I've never been asked to, I want to take it slow for the people around me.) the same fantasy of cutting and running, all pretty and glowy with the idea of being independant, single, with only myself to blame and disappoint and make proud, though I know this isnt what I want. 
I truly believe we have something special, the kind of thing the people around me moan about never being able to find, and I believe we're strong enough to make it work.

What We've Been Doing:

During a therapy session (We've had 3 haphazard sessions so far, when things have gotten bad) girlfriend mentioned how none of this seems real, and she finds herself believing that all of this trans-BS has gone away. 
Then, when she's reminded of the reality of it, it crushes her, worse and worse each time. 

My therapist suggested we simply role-play. Dress up in the clothes I have, do some makeup, watch tv in girlmode together. 

This has helped a lot, actually. Much more than I expected. 

First was just clothes, and it was awkward. (Made worse by EP102 of Orange is the New Black, Laverne Cox's first real appearance), but... we survived it. 

Second time was different. Same thing, she made dinner, I showered and shaved my face to within an inch of its life, and put on a cute tunic and leggings. We just existed, not thinking, not asking, not talking about ""it/us/future"". 

Third time was wild. GF suggested doing my makeup, and we actually had fun with it. She told me I looked pretty, my heart skipped a beat. My mind was filled with a hope I hadnt felt in... at least a year. Thoughts of two wedding dresses danced across my mind as I fell asleep that night.

And this is where we are now. Still together, struggling, but fighitng the fight. 

TL:DR: Came out to girlfriend, still together.

Hi reddit. 

Long time lurker, recent contributor. 
As is customary of this subreddit, I'm sure. 

Short: 
how do I come out to my girlfriend of four years that I'm trans?

Long:
We've been together for four years, friends online for twice that. 
She came across the ocean to South Africa four years ago, and has lived with me since. We've travelled back and forth from SA to USA, and have a very strong bond. 

[before I go any further, since GF reddits far more than I do: 
Girlfriend, Id you read this, I'm sorry, and I love you more than anything. ]

She lives and works with me and my parents at our family run business, and we have plans on moving out eventually. (Well, ASAP, really. She wants to get started on creating a Life together)

I feel like my hands are tied. We're usually together 99% of the day, so going the therapist route (getting a letter, etc) seems out of the question. 
Unfortunately it's the route I would rather take, since SO is a serious sceptic, and I'm dreading her asking the question ""are you sure?"".
(Just to be clear, I'm not really questioning anymore, but can anyone be 100% sure in this situation? There's always that sliver of self doubt. With me anyway)

I'm sorry if this comes across as haphazard, its 3am. I'm on a roof taking photos of lightning, I'm coming down with the flu, but worst of all... I'm just really sad. 

Sad at the idea of losing her. She's one of the most important things in my life, if not THE most important. 
She's taught me more about myself and the world than I could ever have imagined. 
I'm terrified of breaking her heart. 
I'm terrified of the moment after telling her how I feel. What happens, the silence. The tears. Will she stay out of stubbornness or obligation? Will she leave? She doesn't have enough cash to get a ticket home. I'm afraid, straight up. 

Would I rather keep this inside, and pretend it'll go away eventually?

This (Removed) and this (http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/j4kqx/i_now_know_i_will_probably_never_be_able_to_come/) say no. We all know it won't. We all know the best time to do it is now.

Please help, reddit. I feel like I'm nearing a breaking point. I told myself I'd make 2013 the year of change. The starting point on a long and belated journey. 

If I've left things out, or you want more info on something, please say. I just need some pro tips on how to start the sentence.

I wore sports bras that were too small to flatten my chest. I developed an eating disorder with the hopes my hips and breasts would stop growing. When I got my period at 13, I went into a suicidal depression for several weeks. 

By the time I started high school, I was 98 pounds. My hips and breasts kept growing. I could no longer fit into my tiny size zero jeans. I was absolutely disgusted with myself. I gained over 20 pounds within a few months due to being underweight and going through puberty despite running track every day and barely eating.

The thought of what my body was turning into made me want to throw up. Instead of the genderless, carefree kid I used to be, I was now turning into something that made me very obviously female, and these changes were only good for one thing: making babies (yuck!). I made my decision to never have my own kids well before I hit puberty. The thought of myself being pregnant and childbirth in general makes me want to vomit. 

I am 24 years old, but the realization that I did not have to identify with a specific gender did not come until a couple years ago. I had been dieting and exercising compulsively for nearly a decade because I thought I wanted to be thin (because I thought that's what would make me attractive), and then I realized recently that I had been doing it (subconsciously) with the false hopes of shrinking the fat in my hips and breasts so I would come off as more androgynous. 

Within the last year or so, I've worn sports bras 90% of the time. I go through girl phases and boy phases, but I also have phases when I want to be both, and when I want to be neither. Sometimes I have drag queen days where I dress over-the-top and feminine. Most people don't see me as a drag queen since I'm already a female, but that's how I feel on the inside so I don't really care what people think. There is no determination for what type of day I will have when I wake up or how long it will last.

Since I have some serious body dysmorphia, I have ""fat"" days and ""skinny"" days (those who have had eating disorders will probably understand that better). For a while, I had been wondering if my ""fat"" days corresponded with my masculine days and my ""skinny"" days corresponded with my feminine days since I felt more comfortable wearing tight fitting clothes on my skinny days. 

Recently I've realized that though they might be very loosely related, more than I thought. Yesterday was a ""skinny"" day. It also happened to be a somewhat masculine day. I wore skinny jeans, my boyfriend's t-shirt, sneakers, and a bandanna to hold my hair back (it's slightly shorter than shoulder length). I felt like a sexy, genderbending punk rocker and it felt so good. It was a good day.

I'm still going through a lot of self discovery and dealing with my eating issues every day. I have learned a lot about myself. Sometimes my body dysmorphia affects my gender presentation and sometimes it doesn't. 

I don't think I'll ever be truly happy with my body because it's still too curvy (meaning size of breasts and hips) for my liking even on my most feminine days. I really like being female, but I still think my breasts and hips should be smaller. Sometimes I feel like my body is a parody of a woman... the size of my breasts and hips in relation to my stature is almost comical, a gross exaggeration meant to be paraded around like a sexual object at some kind of sexual freak show. I hate it so much. I'm a human being and I hate the fact that my body is so connected to femininity when my brain just wants to do it's own thing.

I am desperately trying to find a good community for me. I've been reading for a while here and this seems like such a welcoming and safe place.

I'm a FAAB andro, out as queer within the last year. I live in a VERY conservative area and presenting in a way that's comfortable to me has been scary. I have always been on the ""tomboy"" end of the scale, but I have recently started binding and wearing more masculine clothing. I have two kids and going out in public to do fun things with them has been met with some awkward stares, moreso than when I'm alone. I worry about my kids in school, since I absolutely fall outside of the typical ""mom"" model, and a lot of the kids here have stay-at-home moms who are like The Ultimate Stereotypical Woman. Being queer here isn't easy, but neither is having a gay parent.

I feel like I'm finally getting comfortable with my gender identity and my presentation, although I do wish that I could figure out binding better. I have really small boobs, so pretty much all sports bras are either too tight in the elastic or too loose in the support. I do often wish I had broader/more muscular shoulders and god, I have wanted facial hair since as long as I can remember.

I'm a twentysomething cisman who likes MAABs who express on the feminine-ish side of the spectrum. In transgender reddits and forums, people like me are criticized as fetishists and 'tranny chasers' and very real threats to the physical and emotional well-being of transwomen, and told to keep our harmful fantasies to ourselves. I know the hostility is intended to protect, but boy oh boy, does it ever make me feel like a dirty perv, resigned to lifelong loneliness, and that my attractions are unnatural consequences of internet porn. 

.

On the other hand, of course I don't want to hurt anyone: the reasoning (as I understand it) is  that many/most transwomen hate being pursued for their trans status because they identify absolutely as women. They have bravely fought terrible battles for the right to use the label of female. And a man pursuing them because, so says the man, they *aren't* quite female, but something else, tarnishes that hard-won status. 

.

I'm curious if the feeling is different in a space like this. **My question:** for feminine-expressing MAABs, or really, anyone here, what has your experience been with dating people who are attracted to your being genderqueer? Is it validating? Is it frustrating if their ideal partner and your ideal expression don't quite match, and they try to change you? I'm interested in anything you have to say.

I already have several hundred but I'm not happy with the sample's diversity. Right now almost everyone is cis-gendered and 86% identify as straight. I'd love to get a lot of trans-gender, gender non-conforming voices in the mix. (You might notice the queer-dog-whistle of the colors I chose for the survey).

This survey is part of a larger project I am doing which is investigating some cultural reasons why so many of us are trying hard to create the life we want, yet we still don't feel great about ourselves or parts of our lives.

I would be so very grateful if you would maybe take this TOTALLY ANONYMOUS survey and then pass it along to others. It takes less than 10 minutes. Did I mention it's ANONYMOUS? Did I mention I would love more gender diversity?

I am not making any money off of this project. I am doing it on my own time outside of work (I was trained to do research). Also, I created this account specifically to get the word about about this survey. So no karma whoring here. Maybe upvote for visibility?

42,2013-02-15 00:18:40,18jto0,6,15,"Okay um. Hi. I guess I should finally introduce myself. I've been lurking here for months and have been wanting to tell my story for a while. ~~I'll try not to make this too long.~~ Edit: oops.

I'm a biological male in my early 30s. I was crossdressing as early as the age of 7, and I ran the painfully awkward gauntlet of puberty and adolescence that I'm sure is very familiar to most of you, where our bodies are changing rapidly, our hormones are firing like mad, and we're questioning who the hell we are from all different angles without knowing any solid answers. I stole clothes from my mom and hid them in my room, which made for some cringeworthy moments when she found them. I ordered panties online and my brother intercepted the mail. I embarrassed the hell out of myself and hated what I was doing, but I couldn't stop.

At first, as I grew into adulthood, I just shoved everything right into the same box as my sexual kinks (literally and figuratively). Having grown up in a very sheltered Midwest small town, my atmosphere didn't allow for much exploration in terms of figuring oneself out. I was just used to the attitude that if you fall anywhere outside of any black-and-white cisgender role, you're ostracized as a weirdo. It took a while after living in the city for things to gradually demystify and I realized this wasn't just some sexual thing. Well, to some extent it was (corsets are hot :P), but to a much larger extent, I see it as simply a healthy expression of my identity and who I am inside. This wonderful, genderbendery, very grey area, girl/boy/person inside.

My life has been a whirlwind of living all over the country, so I'll try not to digress too much... but when I was 25, after I had suffered a bad breakup in Austin, I ran away to Portland. I'm still confused about why I did that. It was a blitz decision in an emotional blur. But one thing sticks out in my memory about that move: I wanted to start over. I was still very, very confused about myself, I was questioning whether I was transgender, and I wanted to move to a brand new city where I had no bad personal associations and where I knew nobody. Open slate, man. I rented a room in the house of a film producer. I increased my meager stash of women's clothing by about twentyfold, and for the first time I was going out in public as a girl. I met a few random people online this way. Then I realized the fun in combining the girl stuff and guy stuff. Flannel shirt + skirt + boots. Pretty cardigan + ratty guy jeans + bright Converse. You get it. In retrospect, I've always been genderqueer, and the habits were totally reflecting that. I have never liked the ""crossdresser"" stigma, nor did I ever truly believe I was transgendered. I'm still not into labels, but I like genderqueer. It's not so much a label as it is a term to describe a liberating realization.

Anyway... my time in Portland didn't last, and a series of new events landed me in Chicago. When I was 28 I went through the biggest, self-loathing shitbag of an identity crisis of my life, and I just... fucking purged everything. Didn't even donate it, I just threw it out. I'm leaving out a **lot** of details here for the sake of the fluidity of this story, so forgive me... but after a domino effect of shitty circumstances that happened to me, I just wanted to be a tough guy. I now know this was a stupid front. I got rid of all my dresses, all my girl stuff, anything that was even *remotely* girly, and my wardrobe since then has been very monotone, guyish, and I hate to say, boring.

I'm tired of typing and I feel I've given enough backstory, so let's skip ahead: **I fucking miss everything. about. this.** I'm 32 now, and I'm tired of putting up fronts, tired of hiding. This is the part where I am going to tell you the snafu of where I am right now. I am currently broke, living with family after some drug addictions ran my life into the ground (15 months clean... yay), and I am back in that same stupid fucking backwards-ass Midwest town that I hated and wanted to leave so badly as a teenager. It is beyond humbling.

I spent the entirety of 2012 depressed, in social isolation and feeling sorry for myself. Recovery has been a bitch in that regard. But somehow in the last two months I have entered this inexplicable, disciplined mental shift. I don't know where it's been coming from. Other than a few exceptions I haven't been depressed. I'm not questioning it too much because I don't want to ruin it. But it has thrown me this side effect: I want to get the hell out. I want to run away again. I don't know where I want to go. *I want to be me again.* 

What's stopping me? Money. In the past, I always had money to run away when I wanted to run away. Now that I'm broke it's a little bit harder. I'm actually currently moving that process forward right now, but it's probably going to take a few months before I build anything up that's significant. In the meantime I have to be patient. I'm frustrated, but at the same time, I am excited for whatever future lies ahead of me.

Funny... this post began as something else entirely, but once I started typing my story I realized how much I needed to say all of this, so I switched the title and focus of the post.

Eh, I'm bad with ending anything I write, so I'll do it abruptly. Thanks for reading. I consider everybody here my buddies, even if y'all are strangers.

Hi. I guess I should finally introduce myself. I\'ve been lurking here for months and have been wanting to tell my story for a while. ~~I\'ll try not to make this too long.~~ Edit: oops.\n\nI\'m a biological male in my early 30s. I was crossdressing as early as the age of 7, and I ran the painfully awkward gauntlet of puberty and adolescence that I\'m sure is very familiar to most of you, where our bodies are changing rapidly, our hormones are firing like mad, and we\'re questioning who the hell we are from all different angles without knowing any solid answers. I stole clothes from my mom and hid them in my room, which made for some cringeworthy moments when she found them. I ordered panties online and my brother intercepted the mail. I embarrassed the hell out of myself and hated what I was doing, but I couldn\'t stop.\n\nAt first, as I grew into adulthood, I just shoved everything right into the same box as my sexual kinks (literally and figuratively). Having grown up in a very sheltered Midwest small town, my atmosphere didn\'t allow for much exploration in terms of figuring oneself out. I was just used to the attitude that if you fall anywhere outside of any black-and-white cisgender role, you\'re ostracized as a weirdo. It took a while after living in the city for things to gradually demystify and I realized this wasn\'t just some sexual thing. Well, to some extent it was (corsets are hot :P), but to a much larger extent, I see it as simply a healthy expression of my identity and who I am inside. This wonderful, genderbendery, very grey area, girl/boy/person inside.\n\nMy life has been a whirlwind of living all over the country, so I\'ll try not to digress too much... but when I was 25, after I had suffered a bad breakup in Austin, I ran away to Portland. I\'m still confused about why I did that. It was a blitz decision in an emotional blur. But one thing sticks out in my memory about that move: I wanted to start over. I was still very, very confused about myself, I was questioning whether I was transgender, and I wanted to move to a brand new city where I had no bad personal associations and where I knew nobody. Open slate, man. I rented a room in the house of a film producer. I increased my meager stash of women\'s clothing by about twentyfold, and for the first time I was going out in public as a girl. I met a few random people online this way. Then I realized the fun in combining the girl stuff and guy stuff. Flannel shirt + skirt + boots. Pretty cardigan + ratty guy jeans + bright Converse. You get it. In retrospect, I\'ve always been genderqueer, and the habits were totally reflecting that. I have never liked the ""crossdresser"" stigma, nor did I ever truly believe I was transgendered. I\'m still not into labels, but I like genderqueer. It\'s not so much a label as it is a term to describe a liberating realization.\n\nAnyway... my time in Portland didn\'t last, and a series of new events landed me in Chicago.

Just tell me what you think would be good on me! http://imgur.com/a/7pHzW

[http://imgur.com/a/7pHzW](This is an album of my current hair.) I've been growing it out for a while from buzzcut length. Was going to grow it rocker length but then I decided against that.

People compliment it a lot at this length, and I kinda like it, but idk. I'm really thinking about a change, especially if it keeps my hair out of my eyes. (I wear hats half the time for this reason so why do I bother with this length in that case? Maybe a little bit longer would be easier to keep out of my eyes when it's down, maybe not.) They also compliment the color a lot. It's medium brown I guess? In light it looks a lot lighter and kinda fabulous.

I'm really considering a new cut though. Or at least new ways of styling it with gel or whatever. I don't normally use gel because my girlfriend hates it and I only do two or three different styles with it which are very simple and don't seem worth it for having sticky gel in your hair all day.

**TL;DR:**

Very thick, brown longish hair needs new ideas/suggestions for cuts and/or styling

I don't know what look I'm going for anymore. If it's attractive I'm willing to consider your suggestion. I like messy, professional looking, (combinations thereof,) and I really like punk-ish styles if anyone has any ideas there. I've wanted to do a weird androgynous-ish cut with blue-dyed hair for a while. But even hearing that it's good as it is would be great. My gf says it is and I only want to cut it/dye it if I think it'll look better.

It's already somewhat feminine imo but I wouldn't mind presenting even more so if it looks good. Not trying to present as anything in particular, so lay any ideas on me you think would look good. I find the mohawk-with-sideburns things I see a lot here kinda overdone (just my personal aesthetic opinion, dont get upset! :D) but something along those lines would be fine.

Background on the lawsuit: There was a 6 year old girl who wanted to use the women's restroom at school. However, the school district wouldn't let her, because she had been born a male. The school district did offer to let her use the unisex bathroom or the nurse's bathroom, instead of the men's, but they wouldn't let her use the women's.

Questions:
1) What exactly is someone who is gender queer? I'm guessing that it goes beyond being ""tomboy"" or ""girly"". However, I don't understand the mentality.

2) Is gender queer coupled with homosexuality? For example, if you have someone who identifies male, does that mean that they will like females? What's the correct way to reference this attraction (homosexual versus heterosexual).

3) Is it possible for someone so young to be gender queer? I've heard (and this may be completely wrong) that homosexuality tends to come to light, once a person gets to be of an age where they acknowledge attraction. I know I thought about boys when I was in 1st grade, so is this just a problem of an adult (me) saying that the girl is too young to process her gender?

4) From the school district's side, what do you think would be a good course of action? At this age, did they offer the best solution that they could?

-My single very earliest memory is crossdressing with my sisters' dance costumes and loving it.

-Starting at age 5 I inexplicably wanted to transform into a girl and I would daydream about it all of the time

-The thoughts subsided during my elementary school years and I had a normal male childhood, but it came back full force at puberty

-The thoughts turned sexual in nature

-Began cross dressing

-To cope with my desire to transform into a girl, I compartmentalized my transgender feelings into sexual fantasies.

-I've never been able to sexually fantasize about being a man in a relationship with a woman, I've always had to be the woman. This led to immense frustrating trying to ""make the pieces fit,"" trying to force myself into the male role in heterosexual fantasies.

-I realized I had a huge problem at 18 and began therapy

-Psychiatrist has had me on every anti-depressant/anxiety in the book. Right now I'm on 4 (celexa, welbutrin, fanapt, and xanax)

-I've been to seven therapists. The gender therapist I saw for only 5 visits because I ran out of money, he seemed to think I was transgender.

-Depressed out of my mind. Not looking forward to anything in life, no hopes or dreams. Having panic attacks every night.

-At 20 I tried an HRT trial, but I got scared and was uncertain, so I quit after 20 days.

-Now at 21, the feelings feel unbearable being in a male body but having the desires to have a female body.

-Not trying to be crude, but to cope with my feelings, I have to sexually fantasize about being a woman multiple times a day just to get any relief.

-Binge eating to cope with my feelings, currently overweight

-I feel hopeless because these feelings are for life, there's no cure.

-Feels like I'm heading towards mental illness if I can't get my depression and anxiety and mental anguish under control.

-I'm considering trying another HRT trial, but I'm not sure how things will be different this time. I'm not sure how I would know if it was right for me. When I would know in my heart that it was for me.

By the time I started high school, I was 98 pounds. My hips and breasts kept growing. I could no longer fit into my tiny size zero jeans. I was absolutely disgusted with myself. I gained over 20 pounds within a few months due to being underweight and going through puberty despite running track every day and barely eating.

The thought of what my body was turning into made me want to throw up. Instead of the genderless, carefree kid I used to be, I was now turning into something that made me very obviously female, and these changes were only good for one thing: making babies (yuck!). I made my decision to never have my own kids well before I hit puberty. The thought of myself being pregnant and childbirth in general makes me want to vomit. 

I am 24 years old, but the realization that I did not have to identify with a specific gender did not come until a couple years ago. I had been dieting and exercising compulsively for nearly a decade because I thought I wanted to be thin (because I thought that's what would make me attractive), and then I realized recently that I had been doing it (subconsciously) with the false hopes of shrinking the fat in my hips and breasts so I would come off as more androgynous. 

Within the last year or so, I've worn sports bras 90% of the time. I go through girl phases and boy phases, but I also have phases when I want to be both, and when I want to be neither. Sometimes I have drag queen days where I dress over-the-top and feminine. Most people don't see me as a drag queen since I'm already a female, but that's how I feel on the inside so I don't really care what people think. There is no determination for what type of day I will have when I wake up or how long it will last.

Since I have some serious body dysmorphia, I have ""fat"" days and ""skinny"" days (those who have had eating disorders will probably understand that better). For a while, I had been wondering if my ""fat"" days corresponded with my masculine days and my ""skinny"" days corresponded with my feminine days since I felt more comfortable wearing tight fitting clothes on my skinny days. 

Recently I've realized that though they might be very loosely related, more than I thought. Yesterday was a ""skinny"" day. It also happened to be a somewhat masculine day. I wore skinny jeans, my boyfriend's t-shirt, sneakers, and a bandanna to hold my hair back (it's slightly shorter than shoulder length). I felt like a sexy, genderbending punk rocker and it felt so good. It was a good day.

I'm still going through a lot of self discovery and dealing with my eating issues every day. I have learned a lot about myself. Sometimes my body dysmorphia affects my gender presentation and sometimes it doesn't. 

I don't think I'll ever be truly happy with my body because it's still too curvy (meaning size of breasts and hips) for my liking even on my most feminine days. I really like being female, but I still think my breasts and hips should be smaller. Sometimes I feel like my body is a parody of a woman... the size of my breasts and hips in relation to my stature is almost comical, a gross exaggeration meant to be paraded around like a sexual object at some kind of sexual freak show. I hate it so much. I'm a human being and I hate the fact that my body is so connected to femininity when my brain just wants to do it's own thing.

I am desperately trying to find a good community for me. I've been reading for a while here and this seems like such a welcoming and safe place.

I'm a FAAB andro, out as queer within the last year. I live in a VERY conservative area and presenting in a way that's comfortable to me has been scary. I have always been on the ""tomboy"" end of the scale, but I have recently started binding and wearing more masculine clothing. I have two kids and going out in public to do fun things with them has been met with some awkward stares, moreso than when I'm alone. I worry about my kids in school, since I absolutely fall outside of the typical ""mom"" model, and a lot of the kids here have stay-at-home moms who are like The Ultimate Stereotypical Woman. Being queer here isn't easy, but neither is having a gay parent.

I feel like I'm finally getting comfortable with my gender identity and my presentation, although I do wish that I could figure out binding better. I have really small boobs, so pretty much all sports bras are either too tight in the elastic or too loose in the support. I do often wish I had broader/more muscular shoulders and god, I have wanted facial hair since as long as I can remember. The dysphoria is getting so much better than it was a year ago, and every day I'm building a little bit of confidence.

Anywho, that's me.

I worry about my kids in school, since I absolutely fall outside of the typical ""mom"" model, and a lot of the kids here have stay-at-home moms who are like The Ultimate Stereotypical Woman. Being queer here isn\'t easy, but neither is having a gay parent.\n\nI feel like I\'m finally getting comfortable with my gender identity and my presentation, although I do wish that I could figure out binding better. I have really small boobs, so pretty much all sports bras are either too tight in the elastic or too loose in the support. I do often wish I had broader/more muscular shoulders and god, I have wanted facial hair since as long as I can remember. The dysphoria is getting so much better than it was a year ago, and every day I\'m building a little bit of confidence.\n\nAnywho, that\'s me.

I'm a twentysomething cisman who likes MAABs who express on the feminine-ish side of the spectrum. In transgender reddits and forums, people like me are criticized as fetishists and 'tranny chasers' and very real threats to the physical and emotional well-being of transwomen, and told to keep our harmful fantasies to ourselves. I know the hostility is intended to protect, but boy oh boy, does it ever make me feel like a dirty perv, resigned to lifelong loneliness, and that my attractions are unnatural consequences of internet porn. 

.

On the other hand, of course I don't want to hurt anyone: the reasoning (as I understand it) is  that many/most transwomen hate being pursued for their trans status because they identify absolutely as women. They have bravely fought terrible battles for the right to use the label of female. And a man pursuing them because, so says the man, they *aren't* quite female, but something else, tarnishes that hard-won status.

I'm curious if the feeling is different in a space like this. **My question:** for feminine-expressing MAABs, or really, anyone here, what has your experience been with dating people who are attracted to your being genderqueer? Is it validating? Is it frustrating if their ideal partner and your ideal expression don't quite match, and they try to change you? I'm interested in anything you have to say.

44,2013-02-10 08:17:31,188mvz,8,3,"UPDATE: 

Results happened. 

I came out to my girlfriend sometime mid-October. 
I had been withdrawing from her, (a result of desperately trying to come up with a ""safe"" (lolz) way of telling her all of this... stuff) and she had started to suspect there might be another girl in my life. 

Only when she threatened to go stay in a hotel for a spell did I realise I had been well and truly backed into the corner I had hoped/expected I eventually would.

I sat her down (with berry cream cheese frosted cupcakes) and ... said it. ""I'm transgendered. I'm a woman.."" and the rest. I took it slow, i think. She listened, nodded, looking at me stonefaced.

It dawned on her slowly that I wasnt joking, and at that point it hit her like a ton of bricks. 
She disappeared to the bathroom, and after a few minutes I realised I should probably go check on her. 
And.. at this point I realised just how close I was to losing her. She was disgusted, infuriated, heartbroken. I think she actually said ""you broke my heart"". (A lot of this day is a blur. I'm okay with that, this isnt a day I want to remember really).

As the day went on, jokes were made, more tears were shed. There was vomiting (stress related, not the cupcakes), she went to the bedroom, asked me not to follow her. I passed out on the couch (and felt terrible for it, ""how does one have a nap at a time like this?!"" i thought, but... a stressful few weeks will do that) and by the evening we were cuddling on the couch. 

Since then, almost every day has been a struggle in its own right. 
Sometimes the struggle is all hers, battling with her dreams of our future, the possibility of what it might be now, whether she should just cut and run and try again with a man, or whether she can learn to be attracted to a woman... who used to be her Man. 

Sometimes the struggle is mine. The desire to start transitioning, the frustration in waiting (though I've never been asked to, I want to take it slow for the people around me.) the same fantasy of cutting and running, all pretty and glowy with the idea of being independant, single, with only myself to blame and disappoint and make proud, though I know this isnt what I want. 
I truly believe we have something special, the kind of thing the people around me moan about never being able to find, and I believe we're strong enough to make it work.

What We've Been Doing:

During a therapy session (We've had 3 haphazard sessions so far, when things have gotten bad) girlfriend mentioned how none of this seems real, and she finds herself believing that all of this trans-BS has gone away. 
Then, when she's reminded of the reality of it, it crushes her, worse and worse each time. 

My therapist suggested we simply role-play. Dress up in the clothes I have, do some makeup, watch tv in girlmode together. 

This has helped a lot, actually. Much more than I expected. 

First was just clothes, and it was awkward. (Made worse by EP102 of Orange is the New Black, Laverne Cox's first real appearance), but... we survived it. 

Second time was different. Same thing, she made dinner, I showered and shaved my face to within an inch of its life, and put on a cute tunic and leggings. We just existed, not thinking, not asking, not talking about ""it/us/future"". 

Third time was wild. GF suggested doing my makeup, and we actually had fun with it. She told me I looked pretty, my heart skipped a beat. My mind was filled with a hope I hadnt felt in... at least a year. Thoughts of two wedding dresses danced across my mind as I fell asleep that night.

And this is where we are now. Still together, struggling, but fighitng the fight. 

TL:DR: Came out to girlfriend, still together.

Hi reddit. 

Long time lurker, recent contributor. 
As is customary of this subreddit, I'm sure. 

Short: 
how do I come out to my girlfriend of four years that I'm trans?

Long:
We've been together for four years, friends online for twice that. 
She came across the ocean to South Africa four years ago, and has lived with me since. We've travelled back and forth from SA to USA, and have a very strong bond. 

[before I go any further, since GF reddits far more than I do: 
Girlfriend, Id you read this, I'm sorry, and I love you more than anything. ]

She lives and works with me and my parents at our family run business, and we have plans on moving out eventually. (Well, ASAP, really. She wants to get started on creating a Life together)

I feel like my hands are tied. We're usually together 99% of the day, so going the therapist route (getting a letter, etc) seems out of the question. 
Unfortunately it's the route I would rather take, since SO is a serious sceptic, and I'm dreading her asking the question ""are you sure?"".
(Just to be clear, I'm not really questioning anymore, but can anyone be 100% sure in this situation? There's always that sliver of self doubt. With me anyway)

I'm sorry if this comes across as haphazard, its 3am. I'm on a roof taking photos of lightning, I'm coming down with the flu, but worst of all... I'm just really sad. 

Sad at the idea of losing her. She's one of the most important things in my life, if not THE most important. 
She's taught me more about myself and the world than I could ever have imagined. 
I'm terrified of breaking her heart. 
I'm terrified of the moment after telling her how I feel. What happens, the silence. The tears. Will she stay out of stubbornness or obligation? Will she leave? She doesn't have enough cash to get a ticket home. I'm afraid, straight up. 

Would I rather keep this inside, and pretend it'll go away eventually?

This (Removed) and this (http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/j4kqx/i_now_know_i_will_probably_never_be_able_to_come/) say no. We all know it won't. We all know the best time to do it is now.

Please help, reddit. I feel like I'm nearing a breaking point. I told myself I'd make 2013 the year of change. The starting point on a long and belated journey. 

If I've left things out, or you want more info on something, please say. I just need some pro tips on how to start the sentence.

I already have several hundred but I'm not happy with the sample's diversity. Right now almost everyone is cis-gendered and 86% identify as straight. I'd love to get a lot of trans-gender, gender non-conforming voices in the mix. (You might notice the queer-dog-whistle of the colors I chose for the survey).

This survey is part of a larger project I am doing which is investigating some cultural reasons why so many of us are trying hard to create the life we want, yet we still don't feel great about ourselves or parts of our lives.

I would be so very grateful if you would maybe take this TOTALLY ANONYMOUS survey and then pass it along to others. It takes less than 10 minutes. Did I mention it's ANONYMOUS? Did I mention I would love more gender diversity?

I am not making any money off of this project. I am doing it on my own time outside of work (I was trained to do research). Also, I created this account specifically to get the word about about this survey. So no karma whoring here. Maybe upvote for visibility?

65,2013-02-15 00:18:40,18jto0,6,15,"Okay um. Hi. I guess I should finally introduce myself. I've been lurking here for months and have been wanting to tell my story for a while. ~~I'll try not to make this too long.~~ Edit: oops.

I'm a biological male in my early 30s. I was crossdressing as early as the age of 7, and I ran the painfully awkward gauntlet of puberty and adolescence that I'm sure is very familiar to most of you, where our bodies are changing rapidly, our hormones are firing like mad, and we're questioning who the hell we are from all different angles without knowing any solid answers. I stole clothes from my mom and hid them in my room, which made for some cringeworthy moments when she found them. I ordered panties online and my brother intercepted the mail. I embarrassed the hell out of myself and hated what I was doing, but I couldn't stop.

At first, as I grew into adulthood, I just shoved everything right into the same box as my sexual kinks (literally and figuratively). Having grown up in a very sheltered Midwest small town, my atmosphere didn't allow for much exploration in terms of figuring oneself out. I was just used to the attitude that if you fall anywhere outside of any black-and-white cisgender role, you're ostracized as a weirdo. It took a while after living in the city for things to gradually demystify and I realized this wasn't just some sexual thing. Well, to some extent it was (corsets are hot :P), but to a much larger extent, I see it as simply a healthy expression of my identity and who I am inside. This wonderful, genderbendery, very grey area, girl/boy/person inside.

My life has been a whirlwind of living all over the country, so I'll try not to digress too much... but when I was 25, after I had suffered a bad breakup in Austin, I ran away to Portland. I'm still confused about why I did that. It was a blitz decision in an emotional blur. But one thing sticks out in my memory about that move: I wanted to start over. I was still very, very confused about myself, I was questioning whether I was transgender, and I wanted to move to a brand new city where I had no bad personal associations and where I knew nobody. Open slate, man. I rented a room in the house of a film producer. I increased my meager stash of women's clothing by about twentyfold, and for the first time I was going out in public as a girl. I met a few random people online this way. Then I realized the fun in combining the girl stuff and guy stuff. Flannel shirt + skirt + boots. Pretty cardigan + ratty guy jeans + bright Converse. You get it. In retrospect, I've always been genderqueer, and the habits were totally reflecting that. I have never liked the ""crossdresser"" stigma, nor did I ever truly believe I was transgendered. I'm still not into labels, but I like genderqueer. It's not so much a label as it is a term to describe a liberating realization.

Anyway... my time in Portland didn't last, and a series of new events landed me in Chicago. When I was 28 I went through the biggest, self-loathing shitbag of an identity crisis of my life, and I just... fucking purged everything. Didn't even donate it, I just threw it out. I'm leaving out a **lot** of details here for the sake of the fluidity of this story, so forgive me... but after a domino effect of shitty circumstances that happened to me, I just wanted to be a tough guy. I now know this was a stupid front. I got rid of all my dresses, all my girl stuff, anything that was even *remotely* girly, and my wardrobe since then has been very monotone, guyish, and I hate to say, boring.

I'm tired of typing and I feel I've given enough backstory, so let's skip ahead: **I fucking miss everything. about. this.** I'm 32 now, and I'm tired of putting up fronts, tired of hiding. This is the part where I am going to tell you the snafu of where I am right now. I am currently broke, living with family after some drug addictions ran my life into the ground (15 months clean... yay), and I am back in that same stupid fucking backwards-ass Midwest town that I hated and wanted to leave so badly as a teenager. It is beyond humbling.

I spent the entirety of 2012 depressed, in social isolation and feeling sorry for myself. Recovery has been a bitch in that regard. But somehow in the last two months I have entered this inexplicable, disciplined mental shift. I don't know where it's been coming from. Other than a few exceptions I haven't been depressed. I'm not questioning it too much because I don't want to ruin it. But it has thrown me this side effect: I want to get the hell out. I want to run away again. I don't know where I want to go. *I want to be me again.* 

What's stopping me? Money. In the past, I always had money to run away when I wanted to run away. Now that I'm broke it's a little bit harder. I'm actually currently moving that process forward right now, but it's probably going to take a few months before I build anything up that's significant. In the meantime I have to be patient. I'm frustrated, but at the same time, I am excited for whatever future lies ahead of me.

Funny... this post began as something else entirely, but once I started typing my story I realized how much I needed to say all of this, so I switched the title and focus of the post.

Eh, I'm bad with ending anything I write, so I'll do it abruptly. Thanks for reading. I consider everybody here my buddies, even if y'all are strangers.

Hi. I guess I should finally introduce myself. I\'ve been lurking here for months and have been wanting to tell my story for a while. ~~I\'ll try not to make this too long.~~ Edit: oops.\n\nI\'m a biological male in my early 30s. I was crossdressing as early as the age of 7, and I ran the painfully awkward gauntlet of puberty and adolescence that I\'m sure is very familiar to most of you, where our bodies are changing rapidly, our hormones are firing like mad, and we\'re questioning who the hell we are from all different angles without knowing any solid answers. I stole clothes from my mom and hid them in my room, which made for some cringeworthy moments when she found them. I ordered panties online and my brother intercepted the mail. I embarrassed the hell out of myself and hated what I was doing, but I couldn\'t stop.\n\nAt first, as I grew into adulthood, I just shoved everything right into the same box as my sexual kinks (literally and figuratively). Having grown up in a very sheltered Midwest small town, my atmosphere didn\'t allow for much exploration in terms of figuring oneself out. I was just used to the attitude that if you fall anywhere outside of any black-and-white cisgender role, you\'re ostracized as a weirdo. It took a while after living in the city for things to gradually demystify and I realized this wasn\'t just some sexual thing. Well, to some extent it was (corsets are hot :P), but to a much larger extent, I see it as simply a healthy expression of my identity and who I am inside. This wonderful, genderbendery, very grey area, girl/boy/person inside.\n\nMy life has been a whirlwind of living all over the country, so I\'ll try not to digress too much... but when I was 25, after I had suffered a bad breakup in Austin, I ran away to Portland. I\'m still confused about why I did that. It was a blitz decision in an emotional blur. But one thing sticks out in my memory about that move: I wanted to start over. I was still very, very confused about myself, I was questioning whether I was transgender, and I wanted to move to a brand new city where I had no bad personal associations and where I knew nobody. Open slate, man. I rented a room in the house of a film producer. I increased my meager stash of women\'s clothing by about twentyfold, and for the first time I was going out in public as a girl. I met a few random people online this way. Then I realized the fun in combining the girl stuff and guy stuff. Flannel shirt + skirt + boots. Pretty cardigan + ratty guy jeans + bright Converse. You get it. In retrospect, I\'ve always been genderqueer, and the habits were totally reflecting that. I have never liked the ""crossdresser"" stigma, nor did I ever truly believe I was transgendered. I\'m still not into labels, but I like genderqueer. It\'s not so much a label as it is a term to describe a liberating realization.\n\nAnyway... my time in Portland didn\'t last, and a series of new events landed me in Chicago.

Just tell me what you think would be good on me! http://imgur.com/a/7pHzW

[http://imgur.com/a/7pHzW](This is an album of my current hair.) I've been growing it out for a while from buzzcut length. Was going to grow it rocker length but then I decided against that.

People compliment it a lot at this length, and I kinda like it, but idk. I'm really thinking about a change, especially if it keeps my hair out of my eyes. (I wear hats half the time for this reason so why do I bother with this length in that case? Maybe a little bit longer would be easier to keep out of my eyes when it's down, maybe not.) They also compliment the color a lot. It's medium brown I guess? In light it looks a lot lighter and kinda fabulous.

I'm really considering a new cut though. Or at least new ways of styling it with gel or whatever. I don't normally use gel because my girlfriend hates it and I only do two or three different styles with it which are very simple and don't seem worth it for having sticky gel in your hair all day.

**TL;DR:**

Very thick, brown longish hair needs new ideas/suggestions for cuts and/or styling

I don't know what look I'm going for anymore. If it's attractive I'm willing to consider your suggestion. I like messy, professional looking, (combinations thereof,) and I really like punk-ish styles if anyone has any ideas there. I've wanted to do a weird androgynous-ish cut with blue-dyed hair for a while. But even hearing that it's good as it is would be great. My gf says it is and I only want to cut it/dye it if I think it'll look better.

It's already somewhat feminine imo but I wouldn't mind presenting even more so if it looks good. Not trying to present as anything in particular, so lay any ideas on me you think would look good. I find the mohawk-with-sideburns things I see a lot here kinda overdone (just my personal aesthetic opinion, dont get upset! :D) but something along those lines would be fine.

Background on the lawsuit: There was a 6 year old girl who wanted to use the women's restroom at school. However, the school district wouldn't let her, because she had been born a male. The school district did offer to let her use the unisex bathroom or the nurse's bathroom, instead of the men's, but they wouldn't let her use the women's.

Questions:
1) What exactly is someone who is gender queer? I'm guessing that it goes beyond being ""tomboy"" or ""girly"". However, I don't understand the mentality.

2) Is gender queer coupled with homosexuality? For example, if you have someone who identifies male, does that mean that they will like females? What's the correct way to reference this attraction (homosexual versus heterosexual).

3) Is it possible for someone so young to be gender queer? I've heard (and this may be completely wrong) that homosexuality tends to come to light, once a person gets to be of an age where they acknowledge attraction. I know I thought about boys when I was in 1st grade, so is this just a problem of an adult (me) saying that the girl is too young to process her gender?

4) From the school district's side, what do you think would be a good course of action? At this age, did they offer the best solution that they could?

I feel like there's an internal struggle going on inside of me, but there's a very thin line between a fantasy and real life. It's very hard to explain, but I'll try;
I get very touchy on the subject of gender. I can talk about other people fine, but whenever the question of gender is asked upon me, I freeze in absolute terror. I'm not sure why. I had always acted at least somewhat like the typical gender stereotype I was expected of. 

I acted as a girl. A quiet girl, but a very emotional and compassionate girl none the less. I had a pink room. I played with stuffed toys and was even in **Girl Scouts** for the majority of my childhood.

Scouting with the girls made me feel something strange. I felt very... different from them. You can probably see where this is going, so I'll try to cut to the chase... typing this out all in one go probably wasn't a good idea.

I never acted properly as a girl. I assumed I had to be one, so I only recently realized that I may have been doing that thing that I dreaded for myself... I was acting. 

I could almost see myself as a guy now. I'm still very touchy about it, though; writing all this out is making my face go red and my heart feeling dropped. 

At the same time, I feel as if I couldn't change myself now even if I wanted to. The amount of internal struggle I already faced with my depression a while ago had torn me up, somewhat. I just don't know what I want anymore. You could almost call me genderqueer.

Though I still secretly prefer the term male. It makes me joyful, at the same time... most people I know would hate me just at the mention of me being bi, not to mention trans. So I kept it a secret around everyone besides one or two special people, and even for them it would be a huge change, and I feel like it might just be too little information at the wrong time... does anyone know what I'm going through? Sorry if this was confusing... I just wrote out my thoughts and now I'm too tired to organize them. 

TL;DR: Too little, too late, scared of rejection but still yearn to be male. Only figured out I might be trans recently after much thought.

For the past couple of years, RadFems have lead the way in using the internet as tool to incite hatred against transgendered people.

Indeed, there are now dozens of RadFem websites devoted precisely to this purpose - with 'RadicalHub' and 'GenderTredner' arguably being the worst offenders.

As time passes, their rhetoric and activism are becoming increasing aggressive - with some of them even going so far as to 'out' transgendered people without their consent.

Disturbingly, some of the most prominent RadFems are even being given platforms to spread their transphobic bigotry in mainstream publications. Take for example, Julie Burchill's recent Observer article.

157,2013-02-13 17:14:38,18gcll,0,9,"A lot of people seem to assume that the cosmetic procedures exclusion clause is what enables insurance plans to deny coverage for gender reassignment surgery (GRS), but in reality, if an insurance company tries to rely on that clause they may end up getting burned and paying for GRS anyway.  The reason is that the cosmetic procedures exclusion clause does not apply to procedures deemed medically necessary.  There was a recent case where an insurance company got burned when it tried to rely on the cosmetic procedures exclusion clause, namely the case of Ida Hammer:

http://www.transgend...show.php?id=384

There was even a case as far back as 1979 where an insurance company tried to rely on that cosmetic procedures exclusion clause and ended up being ordered to pay for the surgery, because it was medically necessary.

So how, do you ask, is it that insurance companies exclude the procedure if the cosmetic procedures exclusion clause doesn't apply?  Simple.  They have a separate clause excluding it under any circumstances.  That way, even if it is medically necessary, they don't have to cover it anyway.  In fact, there is a plan in Mississippi that is being used as that state's benchmark plan for the insurance exchanges being set up next year that says it's excluded even if it's medically necessary.  That way, the question of medical necessity becomes irrelevant and they don't have to cover it anyway.

So next time you read that insurance companies exclude it because it's cosmetic, keep in mind that's inaccurate.  It's not that it's cosmetic, but rather that it's just something insurance companies like to do.  Because of this, Ida Hammer's victory does not apply in general--she just got lucky her plan didn't specifically exclude transgender surgery--and you can be sure that that insurance company is going to put that transgender surgery exclusion clause in when it redoes its plan.  Basically, this won't change in general until either the insurance companies change their industry practice--which may happen after the American Psychiatric Association adopts treatment guidelines for gender dysphoria, though I wouldn't count on it--; until the state or federal government adopts minimum standards requiring coverage by insurance companies--but what politician would want to be seen as supporting sex change surgery coverage?--; or until the way health care is covered is majorly changed. 

I hope I cleared up some misconceptions.

I am 27 years old, and tonight I came out to my parents. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety related to being transgender for a while. Recently, my mother, being the perceptive woman that she is, asked me if there was ""something else that's bothering me."" I said there was, but that I didn't want to talk about it. Over the next few days, I revealed that it was something that I have been struggling with for a while, but that I didn't feel comfortable sharing. Tonight, I received this email from my father.

""I am going to take a chance and put two words out there -- transgender, gay.  I mention them because I understand that there is something that has been on your mind for years, that you are still reflecting on, that you want to discuss with us but find hard to say despite knowing how much we love you and would support you.  I mention them not because I have observed or even thought I ever observed anything that would suggest either word would relate to you but because they are the only things I can think of that would fit the criteria I listed above.  I am not asking you to respond to this part of the note, only the dinner invite, and I promise I will not raise the issue at dinner.  Mom and I will wait for you to raise the issue, whatever it is and however right or wrong we are in our guess, until you are ready.  However, I thought if I said the words first (at least if either of those is the word you are struggling with saying) then it might be easier for you to say one or the other of them.  Please know that whether it is those words or something else entirely different that you are struggling with, we love you now and will love you always.  You are simply you and you are loved unconditionally.""

After receiving this, I drove over to my parents house and had a very honest discussion with them. This was something I had been dreading for 20 years, but it turned into almost a ""non-event."" My father was, against my expectations, completely understanding. I could tell my mother had a few more reservations, but that she wasn't completely against me. I knew she was grieving the son she may lose. Ultimately, though, she squeezed my hand and never let go, saying ""I love you, and we're here no matter what.""

I just want to echo what some others have said before me -- that in order for things to change, it takes brave people to come forward and be honest about who they are. Never again do I want to be ashamed of who I am. It certainly makes it easier that I have a support group, but I want to emphasize that I had no idea how receptive my parents would be.

256,2013-02-21 22:22:36,18zcws,0,1,"Hey, everyone!  I'm working to develop a group called Trans\* Spectrum, built from the ground up by, and for, the trans\* community.  We're based in Windsor, Ontario, and we're hoping to get a space soon to hold meetings.  In the mean time, we've been developing our mission statement and structure.  We would love to get feedback and ideas from the broader community!

Our mission statement is as follows:

Trans\* Spectrum is a group developed by, and for, trans\* people: binary, non-binary, and others alike. The goals of Trans\* Spectrum are to:

1. offer trans\* people support in their transitions and/or life experiences, whatever form these may take;
2. provide trans\* people with a safe space that actively challenges the gender policing, transphobia, transmisogyny, and cis-normativity ubiquitous within current, local society;
3. inspire trans\* people to develop, maintain, and use their voice to advocate for themselves and causes they believe in; and
4. allow trans\* people to meet, and build a sense of community with, people similar to themselves.

To best accomplish these goals, Trans\* Spectrum seeks to reduce any duplication of services by working in partnership with organizations providing service in or around the trans\* communities. In working with these community partners, we hope to offer Trans\* Spectrum members resources and referrals to trans\* positive spaces that would better meet their individual needs, as well as encourage existing services to better serve the trans\* communities.

&lt;/Mission Statement&gt;

At the moment, we are still unsure as to our hours of operation as this would be almost completely depend on the owners of the space that we are using. However, we are currently thinking of having the group every week or every other week for about 2 hours (hopefully, with some leeway so people could stay behind to discuss anything after the main group disperses).

If you would like more information or if you have any helpful suggestions, please contact us! The more input we get on this the better! 

     

We can be contacted at TransSpectrumWindsor@gmail.com, on our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/TransSpectrum, or on our wordpress (http://transspectrum.wordpress.com/).

While it is good that it will eliminate discrimination, logical deductions from reading a Time Healthland article show me that for those of us really set on providing transition-related coverage on a wide scale, this law could make it much more unlikely.  Here's the article:

http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/?hpt=hp_c2

It's long, but worth reading.  It basically shows why costs are so high, and it also shows well that when the health care reform law takes effect next year premia are going to skyrocket, and that is because insurance companies are losing leverage with hospitals and the limits of what the insurance companies have to pay will be removed.

So what does this mean for transition-related coverage?  Well, I think many activists are about to start hearing, if they haven't started already, the words, ""How can you talk about covering sex changes when premia are skyrocketing!""  I've heard it already from my employer.  Sure, you may bring up the benefits of transition-related coverage and all that, but few are going to actually listen once that ""How can you talk about covering sex changes when premia are skyrocketing!"" catchphrase is said.

""OK, well, we'll just get a job at an employer that provides for it,"" you say.  Well, even that is likely to get harder, and my confidence that there will be an attrition in employer-provided coverage has risen after reading this article.  And you know, when you are dumped into the exchanges that transition-related coverage is unlikely to be covered except in maybe one or two states, with SRS not being covered in any state, and with costs coverage will be unlikely to expand beyond that.  Now, you won't see a sudden dumping, but it's likely to be something that will evolve over the next few years.  Basically, companies have 3 ways of doing it:

1.) Just do a straight dumping of all employees.  Employers will have to pay a fine per employee for this, but it's likely to still save them money anyway.

2.) Cut most employees' hours to a little less than 30; that way, they don't have to pay anything for those employees.  Sure, this means they will retain coverage for some employees, such as specialized workers and managers and supervisors, but they will knock out a huge chunk of the cost and here they get to avoid the penalties.  Also, the company would still be able to maintain a 100% HRC score with this.

3.) Move to using primarily contractors.

I think this shows that those who think that SRS coverage is likely to expand under the health care reform law may be a bit too optimistic.  Sure, some may come back and say, Well, Congress will surely step in and fix it.  Sure, but do you trust anything coming out of that gridlocked Congress?  No.  Heck, a likely compromise would be to let people buy subpar insurance and just reduce the penalty to let off the steam.

Basically, don't expect much out of expanding transition-related coverage over the next decade or so, especially as relates to SRS.  Expect the rate of growth in companies covering it to slow massively, with most employers still not covering it.  We will have to rely on charity, not insurance companies or the government, to provide transition-related coverage to the poor.  We should work on vamping that up.
