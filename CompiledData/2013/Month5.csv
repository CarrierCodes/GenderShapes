I do, and while I recognize that reddit as a whole has a tendency to be hostile toward Christianity, I'm simply curious if any of you identify as gender-ambiguous Christians and, if you do, how you work that out theologically, philosophically, scripturally, and in practice.

As for myself, I was raised a Southern Baptist, hung about garden variety north american evangelical churches for a few years and recently converted to Roman Catholicism.  I love theology and I'm fairly conservative, and I know that I always arrive at a few key issues in trying to intersect my gender identity with my faith.

Of course, there's the Leviticus prohibition on the wearing of the other gender's clothing, but I suppose it's easy enough to write that off as being a part of the law, and thereby not a necessary part of the new covenant in Christ.  There are some exegetical problems with writing things like that off, but that's one I can let slide.

Nonetheless, there are still passages in the New Testament which at the least seem to clearly imply that persons of separate gender should more or less be clearly distinguishable.  

Furthermore, it seems at least possible, and perhaps likely, that the writers of the new testament would have thrown intentional cross-gender or non-gender expression into the general lump of ""sexual immorality"" that they are more or less always declaring as belonging only to the realm of behaviors which are sinful.

Thus, while the scriptural text does not anywhere state ""men must wear pants and shall not upon any occasion wear skirts and makeup.  Neither shall any believer express ambiguous gender identity"", it does seem to at least generally hold gender expectations, especially those which are aesthetic, in a high regard.

On the other hand, there is the ever-wonderful passage in Galatians where, among other things, Paul states that ""now that all are in Christ"" there are no distinctions of race, class, or gender.  So maybe gender-neutral or cross gender expression is ""permissible, but not beneficial""?

Furthermore, at the base of all of these questions lies a kind of presupposition in one direction or another on the basic nature of gender-neutral or cross-gender sentiments.

It seems to me that one can evaluate cross-gender or gender neutral desires as 1) fundamentally a part of how God has created certain beings like myself (as more liberal theologians would be likely to say) 2) a ""natural"", inborn and not-chosen distortion of what is ""natural and good"", an indwelling sin which must be combatted i.e. psalm 51's ""in sin did my mother conceive me, in iniquity I was brought forth"" or 3) a psychological distortion which is the result of perhaps some abberant behavior at a point in my life, which is as such sinful and to be eradicated.

Somewhat obviously, I tend toward all of the interpretations of these matters that favor my gender-neutral expression and all of the suits, skirts, ties, nail-polish, cologne and makeup that come with it.  Nonetheless, I feel like I'm always holding these ideas in tension as a gender neutral person and a Christian.

19,2013-05-05 02:14:15,1dpmke,7,17,"   Hello. I'm not sure if this is really the right place to put this.
   I am physically intersexed, as far as I understand, and I'm pansexual. I'm 23 years old, and as far as my gender identity is concerned, I'm quite frankly a mess. I have tried being a woman, I have tried being a man, and neither makes me comfortable, and neither seems to entirely fool people; they always know something is off. I am naturally inclined towards aspects of both. I do not know if that is genderqueer. Most often I wish I was no gender at all. 
   I cannot stand feeling so alienated anymore, so freakish; maintaining a constant dance of trying to guess what other people understand me to be, how that effects the entire battery of their interactions, their outrage and rejection. My every choice on how to appear, how to act, how to dress, is viewed by someone else as a conscious decision to violate their accepted norms, wrong in one way or another. Due to this, and other issues, I have developed a crippling social anxiety. My relationships and my friendships struggle and fail, as if I am a monster and a burden, and I have a dire relationship with my own body. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't really know where else to turn. 
   Is there anyone here who would be willing to talk to me, to PM me? Anything? Anyone who understands anything of what it is to be a living being trapped in this situation? I'm willing to make friends, if that's even possible, I'm willing to listen and to help in any way I can. I just want to feel that I'm not alone.

This is kind of an unnaturally flattering picture of these glasses, but I just cannot get over it. I feel dysphoric about them because I was craving a more masculine/androgynous presentation for so long, and then suddenly started feeling more feminine, and then I find this perfect pair of frames for helping me look more andro. 

At this point I don't think I would feel comfortable in these all the time and have picked out another pair that's a bit more feminine. Still feeling torn up about it though :( 

Anyone out there understand? This gender stuff is hard and tearing me up.

I found my aunt.

They *did* tell me, though.  They said, ""Gerrit's brother has died.""  It didn't register with me, though, because I didn't know Gerrit's *brother*, he was a stranger.  But I knew his *sister*.  She was my hero.

After all that... even at her funeral, they didn't have the decency to refer to her by her true name.  Her chosen name.  They didn't refer to her as *her*.

She lived her whole life as an outcast from her own family, derided, abused.  She was so strong for so long.  And when one of her family finally understood her, was finally proud of her, finally loved her for who she *was*... she never found out.

I know it's not my fault.  She'd already passed when I started looking for her.  But still... I failed her.  I let her down.  And I'm so angry and upset about it.  Why didn't I just figure it out a few months earlier?  It would have been enough!  But I didn't.

I recently found out that getting a prescription for testosterone in my area is pretty easy - there are local doctors who will go by the informed consent model, and all it would take would be an appointment or two with one of them. Of course, now that I have the opportunity to look more masculine and actually potentially be able to pass as not-a-girl (which I cannot currently do despite my best efforts) I am terrified.

Depending on how long it takes me to get an appointment with that doctor who's number I have, I could start taking T in a manner of weeks or months. It's quite likely that even on a low dose people will start being able to see changes by September when I go back to full time classes, and they will certainly be visible before I graduate from university.

Some bleak reality seeped in to the initial euphoria I felt from figuring out that many of the issues I'd been dealing with for years upon years - or, rather, *not* dealing with for years upon years, and just letting these issues crush me down - were gender related.

If I could push a magic button and shift over to being the girl I see in my dreams, I'd probably fracture my hand from hitting that button so hard.  However, I think I'm too old for HRT to do much more than some mental tweaking, and have too many family responsibilities weighing on my remaining earning potential to take any surgical steps (FFS, BE, etc.) that the magic E-juice won't help with.

Today I ran it again, and it seemed to calm things down a little more, make my negative view of the path ahead, while still there, seem a little less catastrophic.

So things are better, but I feel like I'm literally running away from a problem for the time being.

The other problem this job has caused concerns that fact that I am transitioning with testosterone in June.

It still stressed me out though, because I want to be able to transition while fully embracing the changes, and not have to worry about what others would think of me. My managers would get suspicious and I would constantly have to monitor how I presented myself depending on who I was with. Some customers would gender me as a guy, while my coworkers would see me as a girl, while the regulars at the store would just be confused.

Which leads to the point of this post: I think I'm going to quit my job and get a desk job on campus. I would keep my job through the rest of summer but quit once the semester ends. Hours won't be as good, and the pay would be slightly less. However, my current pay already sucks. With a desk job, the pay sucks but I get to do homework or slack off during work. This gives me more time to focus on school, since my grades were horrible this year, as well as relax more my senior year. My rent at my apartment won't be so bad, and if I save up money over the summer I think I could actually save up enough to cover rent for the rest of my lease. The main drawback is that I won't be able to pay off the interest on my unsubsidized loans to prevent it from capitalizing after I graduate. My mother can also help me out financially, and I plan on coming out to her at the end of this month.

I don't think I'm even asking for advice, I just kind of want to post about it. Unless this is actually a horrible idea, in which case tell me. I could easily plan it out so that I start the name change process about the same time I submit taxes so there is no need to notify my old job about a name change. I honestly feel like this is the best option for me, even if it's not the best financial decision. I just want to see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

I suppose this could also double as a bit of a confession, but I think it's more of a ask for help. Thank you to anyone who reads and replies to this, as I am going to be very honest about my situation. :)
As a bit of a set up for this: I am a 15 year old giant of a woman living a life of Constant secrecy and silence as I go about my High School life. I already face constant harassment due to my silent lifestyle and sheer size ( I'm about 5""9-5""10 and about 279 pounds..but I distribute evenly and am very,very broad.) Since realizing my own gender-identity conflicts, I have become increasingly annoyed with any form of female term used towards me..especially ""ladies first"" or ""M'am"". I have begun to naturally ( and a bit sub-consciously) refer to myself by my last name, as my first name is very feminine and tend to wish to act very gentleman-like towards everyone.
I enjoy dressing in men's clothing as it fits my giant form much better than standard woman's clothing. :) But enough about that.
Here goes.

I am 15 years of age and have had a bit of a rough childhood. I have not been in very good shape for a good portion of my life and have been through severe bullying due to various weight and appearance issues. As a girl starting puberty in just the 5th grade, I could already tell that something was amiss. I even recall many failed (and embarrassing) attempts to be more feminine and even join in on what was popular for girls of my age. This included listening to the popular ""girl power"" music of the time and trying to dress in a more attractive way...which for a 10-11 year old wasn't very successful.
 All of my endeavors to ""fit in"" only made the taunting worse as I climbed through the grades. By the 6th grade my tormentors became relentless..I was pushed through the hallways, constantly verbally abused, had multiple objects thrown at me, which then they refused to touch..saying they had been ""contaminated"". I was shunned for being such a disgusting girl and as the years went by I secluded myself from everyone..Never speaking to any ""friendly"" face who tried to talk to me. I swore myself into silence, only speaking when necessary and trying not to fall back into previous depressions. From the 7th to the 8th grade I had come to the realization that I was bisexual, and by the end of the 8th grade fully realized what I had wanted to be all along. 

A boy.

I haven't considered myself a girl..or even a woman in about two years,and I have started to see the world around myself a lot better.
I have come to terms with myself and have found I would love to be male, feeling trapped in a female body and wishing to break free.
Especially after the main effects of puberty, I have loathed every single side effect of womanhood. 
I have know this since the age of around 13, fully realized it at age 14 and have been living and coping at now 15.

It has always been very hard for me to make friends and socialize, even to my own family members or at group events. I find myself stuttering and rubbing my hands when nervous, never being able to find the right words. I become anxious easy..paranoid and am very prone to panic attacks now.

Due to all this, no matter how much I'd like to tell them ( my family, or more so my parents)..I can't.
I come from a slightly religious family..not too overpowering or bearing down on me..but I suppose moderate.
 I had stopped believing in any sort of god, holy spirit etc. years ago and it has always made me uncomfortable at the mention of god or at the question of god towards me.
Lately, I have often been wondering what it would be like should I tell my parents, specifically my father, about all of the secrets I've kept from him for years..my bisexuality, my non-belief in a god, and now my wish to be a male. 

I play out all the different scenarios in my head..confronting him, sending him a letter or a e-mail..and they all turn out bad..
I have no way of knowing how he will react..and it scares me.
I know that he won't disown me..but I'm scared he will speak badly of me to family..or behind my back..though I know he is better than that and I love him.
I'm just scared..I'm scared of telling him the truth. He knows ( I would guess) that I'm not a socially comfortable person. ( though he always seems shocked/surprised whenever I show some sign of discomfort in public)..and to him I've always ""Loved my childhood"".. Despite all of the agony I've faced..all the times I've attempted suicide when the tormenting was too much for me..all this I've never told him. ( and if you are still reading this far, Don't worry, I no longer have any suicidal thoughts.)

He's always seen my as ""his little girl"" and, though he says he will love me no matter what I do in life, I'm afraid he will have a hard time accepting the fact that ""his little girl"" now wants to be ""his little boy""..
But when I think about it, this isn't even the hardest part..
My mother is very religious, always speaking about god and angels.
Everything is a blessing and a miracle and we where all put on this earth for a reason.
My parents divorced, so my mom hadn't really been in the picture when I was 7, and had been ""off-and-on"" with our family throughout that until age 13 when she started making more of a effort.
My mother has a tendency to be very...emotional and often over-exaggerated things. Though I love her, coming out to her is the scariest of the tasks.

I feel like she will be the most judgmental, as I already know she has suspicions of me and my sister being lesbians ( which we aren't fully)..but has never said anything directly to us..just whispers to our eldest sibling. I still feel a intense feeling of judgement from her when I visit. I feel like she still thinks that of me, and I can't shake it. I feel like I'm constantly being looked upon by my appearance..and not being the beautiful young woman she always wanted me to be. Instead she has a un-clean, giant of a ""woman"" who is into monsters and horror stories..the opposite of you or what you wanted. I never feel like she will accept me fully as a personality or a person..

I feel like my life could be better if I confessed..I just don't know how.
I feel like if I did, I would be bombarded with "" no you aren't, get over yourself"" from my father and ""That's not true!"" from my Mother. ( who I then feel would tell all her friends about it, but in a more dramatic way).
I have a older sibling I could attempt telling before any of my parents, but they are so busy now-a-days it would be hard for me to find the chance..I also have developed major trust issues..and while I love them, I feel like they wouldn't hesitate to tell my Father when I have left..and I simply wouldn't be prepared to face the reactions.

I can only think of one other person to tell and that is one of my best friends from younger years.
we've been friends since about the 1st-2nd grade and have been a little off-and-on through the years in terms of communication, but have recently gotten back together and are very,very good friends.
I've recently told him that I was a Atheist, and he didn't even mind. and. He still was my friend despite that.
I feel like I may be able to tell him more then, everything even..if I could get a hold of him on a weekend.
I've had a thought where I would invite him to the park and sit him down, after speaking for a little while I would tell him to listen very carefully..because what I have to say was very important and not to breath what I say to another soul. I would then tell him everything.

Though, of course, in my mind, he was always accepting.
He's always been so laid back, I feel like he would be alright should I tell him..but I still have that seed of doubt in my head.
I have a push telling me to do it soon before it's too late..because If I live with this too long, I may never have the chance to tell anyone and end up living trapped and unhappy forever.

So that's it and all I have to say. I've summed up a lot of it to avoid making this too long..but I'm afraid this has ended up into a novel-sized text and I'm really sorry about that. 
So what I'm asking you Reader, if you can, what is your advice to me and my situation? Where do I go from here? How do I proceed? I'm so sick and scared..and am very tired of living like this.
Thank you very much for reading.

Edit: I have recently been looking into buying a binder, but I'm not sure if I should since I know my dad can see anything I purchase from the internet.

Any advice on what to do for this subject would be appreciated as well. :)",genderqueer,I don't know what to do.

I didn\'t really know where to post this, so I hope it\'s alright if it\'s here. I suppose this could also double as a bit of a confession, but I think it\'s more of a ask for help. Thank you to anyone who reads and replies to this, as I am going to be very honest about my situation. :)\nAs a bit of a set up for this: I am a 15 year old giant of a woman living a life of Constant secrecy and silence as I go about my High School life. I already face constant harassment due to my silent lifestyle and sheer size ( I\'m about 5""9-5""10 and about 279 pounds..but I distribute evenly and am very,very broad.) Since realizing my own gender-identity conflicts, I have become increasingly annoyed with any form of female term used towards me..especially ""ladies first"" or ""M\'am"". I have begun to naturally ( and a bit sub-consciously) refer to myself by my last name, as my first name is very feminine and tend to wish to act very gentleman-like towards everyone.\nI enjoy dressing in men\'s clothing as it fits my giant form much better than standard woman\'s clothing. :) But enough about that.\nHere goes.\n\nI am 15 years of age and have had a bit of a rough childhood. I have not been in very good shape for a good portion of my life and have been through severe bullying due to various weight and appearance issues. As a girl starting puberty in just the 5th grade, I could already tell that something was amiss. I even recall many failed (and embarrassing) attempts to be more feminine and even join in on what was popular for girls of my age. This included listening to the popular ""girl power"" music of the time and trying to dress in a more attractive way...which for a 10-11 year old wasn\'t very successful.\n All of my endeavors to ""fit in"" only made the taunting worse as I climbed through the grades. By the 6th grade my tormentors became relentless..I was pushed through the hallways, constantly verbally abused, had multiple objects thrown at me, which then they refused to touch..saying they had been ""contaminated"". I was shunned for being such a disgusting girl and as the years went by I secluded myself from everyone..Never speaking to any ""friendly"" face who tried to talk to me. I swore myself into silence, only speaking when necessary and trying not to fall back into previous depressions. From the 7th to the 8th grade I had come to the realization that I was bisexual, and by the end of the 8th grade fully realized what I had wanted to be all along. \n\nA boy.\n\nI haven\'t considered myself a girl..or even a woman in about two years,and I have started to see the world around myself a lot better.\nI have come to terms with myself and have found I would love to be male, feeling trapped in a female body and wishing to break free.\nEspecially after the main effects of puberty, I have loathed every single side effect of womanhood. \nI have know this since the age of around 13, fully realized it at age 14 and have been living and coping at now 15.\n\nIt has always been very hard for me to make friends and socialize, even to my own family members or at group events.

PPS: Does an ""okcupid""-esque friendship site really not exist yet? Project, anyone?

This also sort of goes along with a project a friend and I were talking about a few months ago and I'm seriously considering borrowing their web dev experience and seeing what we could possibly build.

So mainly, this edit is asking if any other devs or amateur programmers would be interested in helping get something like this created. If so, PM me and we can try to set up an IM room to dialogue about the feasibility of such a venture.

55,2013-05-13 09:54:14,1e8ivp,4,10,"**I** have always identified as male my whole life, but recently at 20 years old I have been questioning that for a variety of reasons.  I have a stereotypically fit/muscular male body and am fairly attractive in a ""cute"" way rather than a sexy masculine way, ie. I have a young looking face.  I used to be self-conscious about this despite also feeling good that I was attractive in someway.  It took me forever to realize that people actually thought I was attractive, basically I only gained confidence in my looks the past 1.5 years.  






**Now** I am the opposite, I am very happy that I have very little facial hair and body hair because I think androgyny is especially beautiful despite being able to recognize beauty in binary forms as well.  When I see androgynous guys (not fem ""fabulous"" gay guys, but more like guys you could actually mistake for the opposite sex due to potentially make up, hairstyle, and clothing style) I want to be like them and I basically develop crushes because I want them to tell me their secrets of how to live life that way to be honest.  











**I** am basically bored/frustrated (not dysphoric) with my masculine look and feel it doesn't fit me.  Masculine mannerisms don't really fit me all that well either, meaning I don't want to have to be ""the man"" in any specific scenario, I would rather just be me and if that means someone who is more submissive and feminine then I want that to be ok.  I have been dealing with a lot of frustration because I feel lesser than other guys who are super alpha male (feeling jealous that they can comfortably identify that way and I can't) but I also realize that I fucking HATE that attitude/way of presenting yourself.  I figure I am mostly frustrated because I associate that attitude with confidence and success.  I hate it but am ashamed that I can't emulate it and therefore will always be a failure in some way (despite succeeding in almost everything in my life due to a great family and parents).











**I** feel dumb for suddenly wanting to dive into all this feminine stuff now, like why didn't I do it earlier in life if any of it will really make me happier and more secure with my identity (is it just that I have finally gone over the deep end with my porn fetishes?)?  I didn't have a bunch of girlfriends growing up, in fact virtually all my friends have been male and only recently have I developed significant friendships with girls.  I liked sports as long as I didn't have to be overly aggressive which meant that despite my athleticism I could just not get my shit together for football and wrestling (why I wasted my time on that stuff instead of other things like gender modification that are interesting to me now I will never know, ok I liked the fit body it gave me and I was a huge conformist) But I am going to experiment and stop worrying if what I do is masculine or feminine and just be me.




**As** for sex: I have only had a few partners, 2 guys and 1 girl.  I am potentially addicted to porn and fantasy (my orgasms from it are much stronger than with partners, but I haven't been with someone who I was TRULY attracted to on an emotional and physical level yet) which is probably at this point 75% trans or cd, 10% lesbian, 15% gay.  I am not even sure what is a fetish and what is more normal anymore but I suppose it doesn't matter all that much because its a part of me either way.  




**I** used to think that I was fantasizing about being the dominant one when viewing these things, but I now I realize that I fantasize about being the submissive one 95% of the time.  I basically imagine myself in the feminine role, but I am not sure if its because the tabooness of being emasculated is turning me on or if its that I just like the idea of giving up my masculinity to someone else and embracing whatever is left with them.




**I** don't really feel like I fit in with gay dudes that well because two dudes getting it on is not hot to be me unless there is major differences in femininity and masculinity between the two partners which could be represented with big age differences or with one person representing and dressing femininely.  I used to feel super ashamed for wanting to be in this role sexually, but recently I have been like fuck it, I am going to just follow my desires.  I like forced fem stuff as well.  I have never cross-dressed and don't have a specific urge to, but I do want to explore how feminine I can make my face and potentially fem up my clothes a little in terms of fit and style.




**But** lets say I grow my hair out and thin my frame up and learn how to feminize my face ect.  My career goal is not a fucking fashion photographer or owner of ""insert random hip store/item line"" or an artist or even someone who gets by on low wage jobs where people don't give a shit what you look like.  I want to be in healthcare, specifically I want to be a dentist.  How am I suppose to develop a patient base and relate to them when the vast majority of society still thinks anyone who doesn't fit into gender roles is ""weird"" and therefore lesser.  What if changing myself gets me rejected from the interviews or I can't even attract patients because my appearance is to non-normative.  There doubts are weighing heavily on my mind at the moment.  



**Either** way I will DEFINITELY explore this interest of mine.  If it turns out to be more of a passing curiosity or just a form of sexual fulfillment (maybe I am just a fem gay boy in denial, even though I am already out as queer) then I can probably just compartimentalize it, but if it turns out I really like presenting myself this way it could lead to problems in the future.  I have an aggressive social side to me at times but generally I don't deal with criticism or bullying well at all (I have always blended in and didn't have to grow a thick skin basically) and am afraid of running away like a little bitch if anyone attacks me (or even mentions that I am weird) for representing differently.

I have a stereotypically fit/muscular male body and am fairly attractive in a ""cute"" way rather than a sexy masculine way, ie. I have a young looking face.  I used to be self-conscious about this despite also feeling good that I was attractive in someway.  It took me forever to realize that people actually thought I was attractive, basically I only gained confidence in my looks the past 1.5 years.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Now** I am the opposite, I am very happy that I have very little facial hair and body hair because I think androgyny is especially beautiful despite being able to recognize beauty in binary forms as well.  When I see androgynous guys (not fem ""fabulous"" gay guys, but more like guys you could actually mistake for the opposite sex due to potentially make up, hairstyle, and clothing style) I want to be like them and I basically develop crushes because I want them to tell me their secrets of how to live life that way to be honest.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**I** am basically bored/frustrated (not dysphoric) with my masculine look and feel it doesn\'t fit me.  Masculine mannerisms don\'t really fit me all that well either, meaning I don\'t want to have to be ""the man"" in any specific scenario, I would rather just be me and if that means someone who is more submissive and feminine then I want that to be ok.  I have been dealing with a lot of frustration because I feel lesser than other guys who are super alpha male (feeling jealous that they can comfortably identify that way and I can\'t) but I also realize that I fucking HATE that attitude/way of presenting yourself.  I figure I am mostly frustrated because I associate that attitude with confidence and success.  I hate it but am ashamed that I can\'t emulate it and therefore will always be a failure in some way (despite succeeding in almost everything in my life due to a great family and parents).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**I** feel dumb for suddenly wanting to dive into all this feminine stuff now, like why didn\'t I do it earlier in life if any of it will really make me happier and more secure with my identity (is it just that I have finally gone over the deep end with my porn fetishes?)?  I didn\'t have a bunch of girlfriends growing up, in fact virtually all my friends have been male and only recently have I developed significant friendships with girls.  I liked sports as long as I didn\'t have to be overly aggressive which meant that despite my athleticism I could just not get my shit together for football and wrestling (why I wasted my time on that stuff instead of other things like gender modification that are interesting to me now I will never know, ok I liked the fit body it gave me and I was a huge conformist) But I am going to experiment and stop worrying if what I do is masculine or feminine and just be me.\n\n\n\n\n**As** for sex: I have only had a few partners, 2 guys and 1 girl.

**~ Back Story ~**

I was always having trouble identifying who I was as a person. I have had issues with my identity since I was 14 and began high school and possibly even before then as well when I was 11 (that's when the thoughts started to appear). I had always worn boy's clothes up until I was 14 (my parents were awesome and had no issues buying them for me). I had been made fun of a lot when I had turned 13, and when high school hit, I had enough of it so I decided to wear women's clothing (but a few sizes too big). 

Ever since the beginning of high school, I was questioning who I was. The women's clothes bothered me a lot. The summer before I started high school, I had gotten drunk at a beach party and ended up kissing one of my friends, and I had really enjoyed it, but was so confused. I had been called a lesbian throughout my entire high school career (even though I had a boyfriend for the first half of it), it was just a mess. 

Now, I am 21 going on 22 in the summer. I had come out as bisexual last Fall to everyone who was on my Facebook. A lot of people were supportive and didn't really get any negative feedback other than a few of my guy friends had made some rude ""joking"" comments about three sums etc. I was always still struggling with my identity even though coming out as bisexual helped a little. Gender-fluidity has truly given me the insight I needed to help identify who I am as a person and I have never been so happy. I truly feel that I am both genders on different days or sometimes both in one, and I am so happy that the way I feel about myself exists among others as well.



**~ Getting to the Point ~**

I just had some questions as to how to, well, go forward? I realize that I should just continuing being myself, but now that I feel comfortable with myself, I wanted to figure out ways in order to be more masculine since I have been hindering myself on the days that I do and it really sucks. I have longer, past-the-shoulders blonde hair (that I absolutely LOVE and would hate cutting) but I have seen suggestions like putting it under a hat or something to that effect. I rarely wear make up as it is. In terms of men's clothing, I would just wear shirts and then women's pants since I couldn't fit in the men's pants because I am too skinny. I'd just like some suggestions.

**TL;DR: I am a 21 year old, biological woman, and I have identified myself as gender-fluid today and it has made me feel comfortable with myself. I just want insight as to how I could get back into becoming more masculine as I had stopped dressing that way since I was 14 because of bullying and how to go forward as considering one's self as gender-fluid.**",genderqueer,I have finally found a term that I am able to identify with and I am extremely happy -- gender-fluid!

As open minded, well rounded and liberal as I am, I hadn't heard those terms. I read the context clues and figured out what he meant. 

The first thing I did was affirm him that we love him because he is ours, not because he is our hetero son. We love him because he's funny, he's smart, kind, intelligent and so much more. His gender identity, his sexual orientation are non-issues for us. He's been a part of many conversations in our home where we have expressed our feelings about this topic. People are people. Sexuality is complicated. We understand that...even if both of us are cisgender and hetero. Intellectually, and emotionally, we understand that for many, many people it's just not this simple. 

He wants to take the summer to experiment a bit. Grow out his hair etc. Which we are totally okay with. Even if we don't know how to guide him...how to support him.

I've been a lurker on reddit for months. Finally registered recently. And this is one of my only posts. Having read through this sub all day today...I feel safe asking for your advice and perspective. 

I would love to hear your experiences coming out to your parents...what they did right, what they could have done better etc. 

I want to do right by my child. Several months back, I was reading another story in the news about a teen who came out as homosexual...his parents kicked him out, basically disowned him. He committed suicide. I remember crying and crying and saying out loud...even though I was alone...'Sometimes I wish I had a child like this. I know I would love them anyway. I know that I would do everything in my power to help them feel loved, accepted, cherished, and safe to be exactly who they are.' 

Fast forward a few months...and here I am. So far, it seems he's baby stepping. He shaved his arms and legs on Sunday. On Monday I hinted that I have a very nice, if older, dress that might fit him...if he wanted to try it out. His response was 'Cool. I might do that.' 

How can I help him figure this out? How can I support him? Where can I take him dressed as a girl, that he will be accepted? How do I thicken his skin so that what insensitive family members or well-meaning friends say, doesn't cut so deep? 

And how the hell do I find the strength to not fucking care what people think about my child? How do I let it go when someone judges him a freak? When someone I consider a friend or loved one says something asinine? How in the world do I handle that? I know I can be strong and walk away...but I don't ever want him to know that it hurts me when people hurt him. He's sensitive enough that he might revert to not exploring, or to repressing, if he thinks I'm hurting or suffering on his behalf. How do I be a rock for him?

I dated a woman, let's call her ""Jay,"" for almost two years and we broke up just under 2 years ago.  During our relationship, she was always pretty touchy about my gender presentation.  Even liking something that was colored pink caused her to freak out a bit.  

I started coming out about a month ago and I planned on waiting until next week when I'd be a bit more comfortable with everything and I'd be done with graduation etc.  I'll spare the details, but she ended up finding out from her old boss (who manages the concert hall on campus--who I know, but speak to very rarely) via e-mail.

This was all a day or two ago but Jay and I actually spoke about it tonight.  Understandably, she's pretty worked up about it.  I can sympathize and empathize with the confusion and mixed feelings, and I want to make things as easy as possible for her.  My real problem is that she seems to be jumping to a lot of conclusions, namely that parts or all of my feelings for her/our relationship were fake in one way or another.  This is absolutely not the case. 

She kept turning things around on me.  It seemed like she wasn't sure what she wanted to say or ask at the beginning, so I said to her that none of this changes how I felt about her etc. and then she chastised me for being presumptuous.  She was condescending and saying things like ""you need to understand how this affects other people, you need to help them through it.""

Right now, though, I've been drowning in school work, I'm a 5th year and prone to long periods of hole-up-in-my-room-for-weeks depression, so I don't really have close friends here.  I haven't told my parents yet (but I do on Saturday. huzzah!), and I've only been at this a month. 

I've been thinking about my family too.  They're very accepting people, but there's going to be some hard emotions and a sense of loss for them, I know. 

I want to be as supportive and helpful as I can for people, but I don't think I should have to hold their hand through it.  I mean, this is a lot harder for me than anyone else. If anything, shouldn't there be people holding my hand?  I mean, I'm holding it together, but it's taking all I've got.

I have some ideas if you guys want to make it a more regular thing.

One: We should have suggested topic(s) that we come up with beforehand. This gives us introverts in the audience time to think about what we might like to say. Of course, we can open up the floor to questions, concerns, and updates from one another.

The topics chosen should relate in some way to gender identity and presentation, simply because this is the one thing we all have in common. Some tangents are fine, but some structure is a very good thing.

Two: I felt that there were two separate conversations going on at once- stuff happening on cam and stuff happening in the chat. It would be nice if we all tried to listen and respond to everyone. All should have a chance to speak. Questions posed to one another about a topic we all have plenty of interest in (Gender!) might help the conversation be more balanced between participants.

I still hate the idea of being oversexualized, objectified, or dehumanized as a female-bodied person, and I don\'t know to what extent I really feel female - but I feel more feminine than I have in months and am starting to miss my old ways.\n\nI don\'t know if I\'m genderqueer, genderfluid, or just really confused. It scares the crap out of me that I was so convinced I wanted top surgery and T injections and all that jazz - there are people calling me a male name and I\'m embarrassed that I\'ve even said anything to anyone. I almost feel like being with him made me feel like I needed to be masculine, somehow? I can\'t explain but it makes me feel crazy, like I was just trying desperately to have some kind of identity when I feel like I never really have.\n\nWhatever the truth is, I don\'t know how I could be so convinced one way and suddenly so convinced of something else.

Mic/Cam not required, but it might be fun to see your lovely/handsome/beautiful/cute/attractive face!

We are going to start at 8 PM EST on Friday, March 24. I will be on from 8 till 9, possibly longer.

The first bit is going to be a loosely moderated discussion. Our theme will be *identity*.

Who are you? Who are you becoming? What led you to your current state of self-awareness?

What are the words you use to describe yourself? Do the words vary depending on audience, place, time, or other factors?

Who is your 'my-your-me'? That's the person YOU think that OTHERS see you as. For example, I think people in certain situations may believe I am a butch lesbian. This is totally not in line with how I view myself, and may not be how others actually view me. Do your thoughts of how others may view you color how you present yourself? If so, how?

Is there a 'real you'? Could there be more than one, or none at all?

The Rules!

-You do not have to talk! You can just lurk, if you like.

-Whether or not you talk, please listen respectfully to others.

-You can use either cam, text chat, or both!

-All are invited! Queer, Cis, Questioning, Llamas, you name it!

I just don't consider it a deciding factor for the way any other aspect of my life is. I dress the way I want. I dress in clothes that fit and look good on my body. I have a fairly androgynous style, though sometimes I will dress more feminine or masculine depending on my mood.

I'm going through pictures of myself on Facebook from this past weekend and I think, ""In all the pictures of me where I'm wearing women's clothing, I look absolutely ridiculous."" Maybe this is not so much a case of dysphoria as it is body-image issues. 

I look fat. Plain and simple. Women's clothing is typically designed to show off our curves. Some clothing is designed to flatter them. 

I am pretty fit (not to be confused with skinny), so I dress in a way that I think shows off my body without being too feminine. I usually wear skinny jeans and a tank or a t-shirt, and a plaid button down shirt. I guess I forget how wide my hips are or something, because when I look in the mirror, I like my body. I'm not too curvy (or so I think), so I imagine I can get away with looking androgynous while wearing skinny jeans. I guess not. Pictures tell a different story than the mirror. I have big hips. And I'm fat. And when I wear women's clothing, I look ridiculous because I don't have a particularly feminine body, even though I'm a healthy, fit female.

I got these black skinny jeans that fit me like a glove. I thought they showed off my super muscular thighs. I thought no other pants fit me as well as these. No. They just just accentuate my fat thighs and big hips. 

Today I put on boy's jeans and a wife-beater (is there another word for those tank tops? what a terrible word..). I felt good about the way I look today. 

I'm just feeling really down. I don't know what I am anymore. I guess this is more of a body acceptance issue than a genderqueer one? Maybe both? I'm confused about myself. I can't distinguish my feminine curves from fat. 

I don't really know what I'm asking. Maybe somebody could help shed some light or relate or give me some perspective? Or an opinion? What ever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Part One: The Road Less Travelled By

If I could go back nothing would change. It’s funny how the thorns that has dug into my emotional state for so long could be attached to flowers so precious, so beautiful, I’d gladly experience the pain again, no matter how great the feeling of a smooth life of it would be. But perhaps troubles create preciousness? If abnormal were normal, and normal is the worst punishment of all, should I ever really want my “abnormal” to conform to something I’ve so often thought of as a shallow disguise to fit in with an ever changing flow because “difference is scary” in the “everyone else is doing it” generation.

But it’s not a generation is it? Thousands of years of an ever changing cut and paste. Everything’s changing except what we want, and what we want is the status quo of what we understand, because majority rules, and the majority calls for oppression. Hiding behind a veil of “progressiveness” just because you treat one group slightly less like the dirt you wiped off your shoe. Equal rights are oppression of the majority, but excusing their faults cause ours are more grave. Love isn’t love anymore, love is a conditional response, and I haven’t fulfilled the requirements.

I tried to fill these conditions once. I submitted my claim, but time said no, and I was cast back into a searching tunnel with no flashlight. But when I find a little glimpse of light, I can’t follow it because our lights don’t “complement” each other. Because no one cares if it leads to the destination because my path isn’t the “right one.” I think Robert Frost had the right idea in that road less travelled by.

The path is rough, and the world throws rocks at the travelers. High school opened the door to it, but it slammed behind me. I never felt the path was wrong, but I knew as soon as I went through the arch I knew what I was going to leave behind. And so we’ve come full circle, because I tried my best to love, but did those I love do it back of their own accord or another condition? And once the door closed, the fear set in, that I broke the contract and lost it all, because my conditions were no longer met. So enough of the allegories, because this isn’t a veil, this is my reality. A reality where there’s no conditions, and the word “gender” means nothing but an arbitrary label of preference.

Part 2: A Monster Called Gender

Who could’ve forseen the irony of where it’d all begin? Under the watchful eye of those that would condemn me, my life changed instantly. His name is not important, but his presence was the only catalyst that mattered. In a world where everyone told me that it was wrong, it was the only thing at the moment that felt right. All I was taught was fear and pain and unquestioning obedience, but the moment with him was an oasis, no different than any moment I felt with a she. And the only thing that had felt so right in so long, brought forth the terrible realization of a world that’s so wrong.

Now let me make it clear, make no mistake, not once did I feel conviction for my path. But those that were the closest to me, or were they ever really close? Could I ever truly be close to those that would be the first to condemn the feelings of intuition. It was a fear, a fear so great that it clawed at the edges of my mind, screaming to be let out, yet it screamed in silence as I droned about school life. Being a “good Christian boy” during the day time, keeping the monster in quiet submission as I was taught to lead unquestioningly, because questioning was only a fast-track to damnation. And yet at night I could drop the façade, and meet up with him, feeling a sincere and innocent embrace that felt as though the monster of my fear were not just silence, it was a metamorphosis. The same thoughts in a different lens, where gender meant nothing, where even I could escape the cold gripping hands of the roles I was so often enduring.

But the transformation was just a temporary solution, and it returned in the day. Every day it grew stronger like a poison spreading through the veins of my thoughts. And like a ripping wound the pain grew and festered, until one day it punctured my heart. And the breeze was cold. A moment that cannot be written so eloquent, as would ruin its justice. For this was the most ineloquent and destructive, yet powerful and saving moment of my life. 

The breeze was cool, and search for no poetical language, what I say now is as literal as anything.  The window sill was large enough to seat me comfortable, but there was no comfort in any part of this moment. The ledge I sat on quickly began to feel like a lifting slope, threatening to slide me into the depths of the concrete below. But I was my own catalyst, and what I had grown to believe was the biggest threat of all. But could this be it? I stared down 5 stories and realized that the end I so bitterly sought, wasn’t what I sought at all. What I sought was an end, an end to gender. And the trip began slowly, painfully, and with much resistance, but I’ve learned so much, on how to live without it.

Part 3: Genderqueer?

It’s amazing how long something can hide. Feelings so ingrained from the beginning that I could remember, that I didn’t belong. “Boy” “son” “one of the guys” “dude” like mismatched labels being forced into the hole that didn’t fit. And yet why was I so often called it? Always being told what I should like, and what I should do.  Cars, workouts, and sports, as though there were a mold to fit everyone. And yet I was told there was only black and white, two opposites, the boy and girl. But with only two hemispheres, why did I feel like I didn’t fit on the map? It was as though black and white were all the same shade of grey. 

Is this why I couldn’t belong? Who could I tell? All my feelings cast aside in the name of redemption? And yet mind and body in a mismatch by the coercion of everything I had been taught. A match for positive and negative, but is love really all you need, when the one you love is a forbidden shade? In an ever changing test of loves endurance, harder by the minute, rewarding by the second.

Years have passed reversing through the window that almost closed the book. So much has changed, like a new lens fixed into my perception. Suddenly a black and white world so full of color. And suddenly I realize perhaps my love is not colorblind, but the love of all color, the ability to come close to the inherent preciousness of every color. And yet one has caught my eye, no not one color, but one person so precious, every color shines through. A love that colors could intertwine, a mixture of pure joy and innocence. And yet there was a color missing. In a world so full of color, could I still only see my shade of grey?

And yet I could never have forseen the liberator of my own colorless feelings. The kindness of a stranger, found through a simple connection of having left behind the same vice grip of condemnation. Pushing myself out of my shell, to see what I could truly be. It wasn’t a big store, but it had exactly what was needed to get a glimpse of the color hiding underneath the façade forced upon me from an assigned birth.

Hope you enjoy\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart One: The Road Less Travelled By\n\nIf I could go back nothing would change. It’s funny how the thorns that has dug into my emotional state for so long could be attached to flowers so precious, so beautiful, I’d gladly experience the pain again, no matter how great the feeling of a smooth life of it would be. But perhaps troubles create preciousness? If abnormal were normal, and normal is the worst punishment of all, should I ever really want my “abnormal” to conform to something I’ve so often thought of as a shallow disguise to fit in with an ever changing flow because “difference is scary” in the “everyone else is doing it” generation.\n\nBut it’s not a generation is it? Thousands of years of an ever changing cut and paste. Everything’s changing except what we want, and what we want is the status quo of what we understand, because majority rules, and the majority calls for oppression. Hiding behind a veil of “progressiveness” just because you treat one group slightly less like the dirt you wiped off your shoe. Equal rights are oppression of the majority, but excusing their faults cause ours are more grave. Love isn’t love anymore, love is a conditional response, and I haven’t fulfilled the requirements.\n\nI tried to fill these conditions once. I submitted my claim, but time said no, and I was cast back into a searching tunnel with no flashlight. But when I find a little glimpse of light, I can’t follow it because our lights don’t “complement” each other. Because no one cares if it leads to the destination because my path isn’t the “right one.” I think Robert Frost had the right idea in that road less travelled by.\n\nThe path is rough, and the world throws rocks at the travelers. High school opened the door to it, but it slammed behind me. I never felt the path was wrong, but I knew as soon as I went through the arch I knew what I was going to leave behind. And so we’ve come full circle, because I tried my best to love, but did those I love do it back of their own accord or another condition? And once the door closed, the fear set in, that I broke the contract and lost it all, because my conditions were no longer met. So enough of the allegories, because this isn’t a veil, this is my reality. A reality where there’s no conditions, and the word “gender” means nothing but an arbitrary label of preference.\n\nPart 2: A Monster Called Gender\n\nWho could’ve forseen the irony of where it’d all begin? Under the watchful eye of those that would condemn me, my life changed instantly. His name is not important, but his presence was the only catalyst that mattered. In a world where everyone told me that it was wrong, it was the only thing at the moment that felt right. All I was taught was fear and pain and unquestioning obedience, but the moment with him was an oasis, no different than any moment I felt with a she. And the only thing that had felt so right in so long, brought forth the terrible realization of a world that’s so wrong.\n\nNow let me make it clear, make no mistake, not once did I feel conviction for my path. But those that were the closest to me, or were they ever really close? Could I ever truly be close to those that would be the first to condemn the feelings of intuition. It was a fear, a fear so great that it clawed at the edges of my mind, screaming to be let out, yet it screamed in silence as I droned about school life. Being a “good Christian boy” during the day time, keeping the monster in quiet submission as I was taught to lead unquestioningly, because questioning was only a fast-track to damnation. And yet at night I could drop the façade, and meet up with him, feeling a sincere and innocent embrace that felt as though the monster of my fear were not just silence, it was a metamorphosis. The same thoughts in a different lens, where gender meant nothing, where even I could escape the cold gripping hands of the roles I was so often enduring.\n\nBut the transformation was just a temporary solution, and it returned in the day. Every day it grew stronger like a poison spreading through the veins of my thoughts. And like a ripping wound the pain grew and festered, until one day it punctured my heart. And the breeze was cold. A moment that cannot be written so eloquent, as would ruin its justice. For this was the most ineloquent and destructive, yet powerful and saving moment of my life. \n\nThe breeze was cool, and search for no poetical language, what I say now is as literal as anything.  The window sill was large enough to seat me comfortable, but there was no comfort in any part of this moment. The ledge I sat on quickly began to feel like a lifting slope, threatening to slide me into the depths of the concrete below. But I was my own catalyst, and what I had grown to believe was the biggest threat of all. But could this be it? I stared down 5 stories and realized that the end I so bitterly sought, wasn’t what I sought at all. What I sought was an end, an end to gender. And the trip began slowly, painfully, and with much resistance, but I’ve learned so much, on how to live without it.\n\nPart 3: Genderqueer?\n\nIt’s amazing how long something can hide. Feelings so ingrained from the beginning that I could remember, that I didn’t belong. “Boy” “son” “one of the guys” “dude” like mismatched labels being forced into the hole that didn’t fit. And yet why was I so often called it? Always being told what I should like, and what I should do.  Cars, workouts, and sports, as though there were a mold to fit everyone. And yet I was told there was only black and white, two opposites, the boy and girl. But with only two hemispheres, why did I feel like I didn’t fit on the map? It was as though black and white were all the same shade of grey. \n\nIs this why I couldn’t belong? Who could I tell? All my feelings cast aside in the name of redemption? And yet mind and body in a mismatch by the coercion of everything I had been taught. A match for positive and negative, but is love really all you need, when the one you love is a forbidden shade? In an ever changing test of loves endurance, harder by the minute, rewarding by the second.\n\nYears have passed reversing through the window that almost closed the book. So much has changed, like a new lens fixed into my perception. Suddenly a black and white world so full of color. And suddenly I realize perhaps my love is not colorblind, but the love of all color, the ability to come close to the inherent preciousness of every color. And yet one has caught my eye, no not one color, but one person so precious, every color shines through. A love that colors could intertwine, a mixture of pure joy and innocence. And yet there was a color missing. In a world so full of color, could I still only see my shade of grey?\n\nAnd yet I could never have forseen the liberator of my own colorless feelings. The kindness of a stranger, found through a simple connection of having left behind the same vice grip of condemnation. Pushing myself out of my shell, to see what I could truly be. It wasn’t a big store, but it had exactly what was needed to get a glimpse of the color hiding underneath the façade forced upon me from an assigned birth. \n\nSizes too small, sizes too big, breaking the binary was hard to calculate. And yet it was such a wonderful time. Outfits of color, dropping the forced idea of masculinity, and yet feeling no femininity, but only me. Knowing full well I could be called “fag” “drag queen” and other useless empty words from the closed mind of indoctrination. But for those brief moments, full of laughter and blushing, skirts and v-necks, tops and capris, everything felt ok.\n\nEverything felt as though it fit.

99,2013-05-27 00:50:56,1f3zhg,24,8,"Hi,

My basic question is that once you started questioning your gender, how did you stop yourself from just going ""oh I am trans obviously, if I don't fit into the binary I am in right now"".  And do you wish you were fully trans or completely comfortable with your assigned gender, rather than somewhere in between?

I [M20] started questioning my gender recently.  I cross-dressed and put some make up recently for the first time and loved it.  I incorporated it into my sex life and it improved it a lot, I found it easier to fantasize in a feminine role sexually when I had the trappings.  I felt very pretty in general and loved my feminine look.

I tend to think very black and white when dealing with personal identity, which I realize is kind of the antithesis of self-discovery and ""take things as they are"".  When I started to think about gender and why I liked reading about trans/gender non-binary stuff so much, I jumped immediately to thinking I'm trans, which logically I know is a little niave.

I don't really feel dysphoric, I am just not attached to my maleness much anymore at this point in my life, except that I know that it comes off well to others and allows me to be successful in my goals without any extra work or dealing with intolerance.

So, I guess, would it be weird of me to be disappointed that I am not trans and maybe just somewhere in the middle?  It would be more comfortable for me to know that I am ""this"" or ""that"" rather than this undefined thing in the middle that could be anything and is very hard for people to relate to.

And also, how do I know this all isn't just a phase because I am bored with life (seems a shallow way to live life)?

Around February of this year, in my last semester of Undergrad, I decided, ""Fuck it, Imma do what I want.""  I'm a biological male, 6'6"" and with a very masculine form, but I decided to start openly wearing makeup, nail polish and whatever clothes I wanted to.  For a solid three months I had a terrific experience expanding my own horizons and getting comfortable in my own skin and in my own ambiguous gender identity.  I learned in those months that there are such things as comfort, acceptance and love for people like us.  There is peace and community and normalcy, in some contexts, when you just decide to do it and let yourself be yourself.

It culminated in going to my spring formal in a dress and patterned stockings.  All of my friends were supportive, and it was perhaps the best night I've ever had.  They were all supportive, a few girls complimented me on my style choices, and on the whole the night was glorious.  A week later I wore makeup and nail polish at graduation, and later when I went out to dinner I kept the makeup and nail polish and wore capris with the same patterned stockings I wore to formal.  It felt great.  Here I was, out in public, looking genuinely good in a gender-ambiguous way, comfortable with myself.

(by the way, Roberts Wesleyan College in Rochester, NY, where I attended, was a loving, accepting community.  Somewhat surprising for its conservative theological base, but worth stating and commending here)

Anyway, I didn't get into grad school so I had to move down to Mississippi to live with my Mom and Step-Dad.  I don't have a job yet, and I can't seem to get one yet, so I can't move out onto my own yet.

I've tried even wearing makeup around them, but it seems like every time I do I'm met with disapproval, criticism and outright scorn.  I love my Mom more than anyone else in the world, but it seems like I can't do anything outside of accepted gender binary without her reminding me that my gender-ambiguous behavior is harmful to my employment prospects and my lifelong success potential.  I want to say that she's wrong, but living in Mississippi she's probably right.

I feel like I've gone from living life in an open field to living in a small room.  I already have the shock that I'm not in college anymore (I'm working on getting into ""normal"" grad school to become a teacher now) and on top of that I have to find a way to deal with the fact that I can't dress myself and present myself how I want to if I'm to expect any measure of normal employment and fulfillment, I have to keep myself confined to the binary.

I know how to ""just do it"", I know how to get over societal conceptions and hold my head high in stockings and a denim skirt.  That's not the issue.

I don't know how to stare down the person who loves me the most and tell her that she's wrong when I know she isn't.

I don't know how to stare down the harsh realities of employment in the deep south and still manage to be myself.

Staying in the closet, pretending, isn't an option after what I learned back in college, but at the same time I feel like the expression I crave is similarly no longer a viable option for pursuing the path of life that I want.

102,2013-05-27 06:29:11,1f4ikg,18,23,"I just don't know and I'm kind of scared. You know?

I'm FAAB, always been kind of masculine. Mostly interested in women. For a while--after that period starting in middle school when I assumed I must've been straight--I identified as a butch mostly-lesbian (or a butch bisexual, but I have been leaning further for a while). But then, after learning about real transgender people on the internet, stuff has come flooding back. I've always been fascinated by transgender people, and where is my beard and what are *these*? 

I actually remember the *moment* I realized I was going to grow boobs. My (male, like all the others) friend brought it up, during grade school: ""What are you gonna do when you grow boobs?""

Horror. In my mind: ""Oh. My. God. I'm going to grow *boobs*. I mean--of course I am, how could I not have realized, but...no, please no. I don't want to. I can't. This isn't right. Am I going to have to call them breasts, too? Of course I will. And I'll have to be a *mom*. Please, God, anybody, no.""

I hate my body. Why am I so narrow and dainty? Why is my voice like this? This isn't what it's like in my head. My voice surprises me when I speak out loud. And where the heck is my beard? Aren't I supposed to be shaving by now? I want to shave. (Puberty was horrible. All the wrong things. Why did those people get to have the right things, and why did those other people get these things and like them? What's wrong with me?)

And of course the sexual stuff: I can't bear to imagine being the ""woman"" in these situations, but imagining being the ""man"", having the parts, is unimaginable relief, like wiggling out of a rope that has been cutting off circulation to my body for years. 

But I don't just want to be a *man*. I've cosied up to the idea of being a lesbian, and a butch one at that: I wear it on my sleeve, people see exactly what I am, and people like me (gay people, trans people, people who haven't had the standard straight, cisgender experience of sexuality) see me and recognize me. I know (if I recognize them) what it feels like, in part, to be them, and they know what it is like to be me. That thing when you were a kid? Oh my god me too! And all that shit that some ""normal"" people will throw at you many fewer of these people will throw at you. I do not have to explain myself to these people: They know already. And they *like* this part of me. I like the idea of being in the queer community and if I transition (and pass), while I might not lose being in the queer community, I will lose being there visibly. I will have to identify myself and even then I might not fit as well as some others.

I don't need to be read as a man, I just want the man's body. Does that make sense? I mean, even typing it that way feels weird--a man's body *is* my body. This thing is not my body, cannot be my body. (But this is what everybody sees when they look at me.) Ugh. 

I mean, there are some things that the world does when it reads me as female that I don't like--assuming that I'm interested in some ""girly"" things and not in some ""guy"" things, which it generally gets wrong, and other sex-related prejudices--but those things aren't about me being male or female in itself but about society's hangups. I could do without those. Without those, I might not not mind being read as female. However, I might not mind being read as male--might like being read as male--if I could also be read as gay or queer. (Also, how boring would it be to appear to the world to be a straight guy? That thought has me reeling. Just me leaving what I'm used to, though.)

Finding you people (not just the genderqueer people, but queers of all kinds) here on the internet has brought the light back into me. There are people like me and life doesn't have to be middle school. I don't want to leave that. 

So, I've been identifying as genderqueer for a while. I don't actually have my gender perfectly narrowed down, but I do know what body is the right body, and I do like the queer community. But I'm wondering if I'm basing my genderqueer identity not on my *gender* but on my desire to be more male than I am (from genuine instinct and dysphoria) minus my fear of actually transitioning, stemming from my reluctance to pull myself out of the queer community (which is less gender and more just lifestyle). I wonder if I should just be identifying as trans (like, binary trans). I don't know. 

Anyway. This has been rattling around in my head and threatening to poke a hole for a while. Thanks for listening, if you've gotten this far.

You know?\n\nI\'m FAAB, always been kind of masculine. Mostly interested in women. For a while--after that period starting in middle school when I assumed I must\'ve been straight--I identified as a butch mostly-lesbian (or a butch bisexual, but I have been leaning further for a while). But then, after learning about real transgender people on the internet, stuff has come flooding back. I\'ve always been fascinated by transgender people, and where is my beard and what are *these*? \n\nI actually remember the *moment* I realized I was going to grow boobs. My (male, like all the others) friend brought it up, during grade school: ""What are you gonna do when you grow boobs?""\n\nHorror. In my mind: ""Oh. My. God. I\'m going to grow *boobs*. I mean--of course I am, how could I not have realized, but...no, please no. I don\'t want to. I can\'t. This isn\'t right. Am I going to have to call them breasts, too? Of course I will. And I\'ll have to be a *mom*. Please, God, anybody, no.""\n\nI hate my body. Why am I so narrow and dainty? Why is my voice like this? This isn\'t what it\'s like in my head. My voice surprises me when I speak out loud. And where the heck is my beard? Aren\'t I supposed to be shaving by now? I want to shave. (Puberty was horrible. All the wrong things. Why did those people get to have the right things, and why did those other people get these things and like them? What\'s wrong with me?)\n\nAnd of course the sexual stuff: I can\'t bear to imagine being the ""woman"" in these situations, but imagining being the ""man"", having the parts, is unimaginable relief, like wiggling out of a rope that has been cutting off circulation to my body for years. \n\nBut I don\'t just want to be a *man*. I\'ve cosied up to the idea of being a lesbian, and a butch one at that: I wear it on my sleeve, people see exactly what I am, and people like me (gay people, trans people, people who haven\'t had the standard straight, cisgender experience of sexuality) see me and recognize me. I know (if I recognize them) what it feels like, in part, to be them, and they know what it is like to be me. That thing when you were a kid? Oh my god me too! And all that shit that some ""normal"" people will throw at you many fewer of these people will throw at you. I do not have to explain myself to these people: They know already. And they *like* this part of me. I like the idea of being in the queer community and if I transition (and pass), while I might not lose being in the queer community, I will lose being there visibly. I will have to identify myself and even then I might not fit as well as some others.\n\nI don\'t need to be read as a man, I just want the man\'s body. Does that make sense? I mean, even typing it that way feels weird--a man\'s body *is* my body. This thing is not my body, cannot be my body. (But this is what everybody sees when they look at me.) Ugh. \n\nI mean, there are some things that the world does when it reads me as female that I don\'t like--assuming that I\'m interested in some ""girly"" things and not in some ""guy"" things, which it generally gets wrong, and other sex-related prejudices--but those things aren\'t about me being male or female in itself but about society\'s hangups. I could do without those. Without those, I might not not mind being read as female. However, I might not mind being read as male--might like being read as male--if I could also be read as gay or queer. (Also, how boring would it be to appear to the world to be a straight guy?

It always weirded me out trying to be ‘feminine’, and overly girly clothes made me uncomfortable, and just wound up making me feel “hyper-sexualized” in a way. 

Whenever I showed any curiosity about sexuality and gender it was also swiftly and harshly dealt with, and I quickly ""learned"" that it was bad, nasty or ugly and not to be explored or questioned.

At this point I’ve ruled out identifying as cisfemale, woman, or man. Female is more accurate than male, but woman is no more accurate than man. Agender seems to be the best-fitting term I’ve found so far. I don’t really seek out fellow queer people because my social circle is diverse and accepting… but I do feel like I lack understanding with most of my friends. I also don’t really fit the mold of the queer culture here.

About two years ago, I met the first person I knew to identify as genderqueer. I had previously known plenty of gay/lesbian/bisexual people, as well as a handful of trans* people (i.e. 2), but this was probably my first real experience with an out non-binary person. I was pretty excited to find somebody else who liked to bind sometimes, liked different pronouns sometimes, etc. She was how I learned the term “genderqueer.” So we hung out a couple times, never really became friends because she moved away a couple of months after we met. No big deal, we didn’t have much else in common anyway. 

Fast forward two years, multiply my identity issues by 920, and I meet another genderqueer. This time I’m not so much drawn to the “exoticism” of their non-binary presentation as the glimpses of myself I see in this person. This is a little disturbing to me (mostly because they usually present as male) and magnifies my identity issues. It simultaneously felt SO GOOD and SO BAD to be around this person. Over several months, we sort of become friends. It’s incredibly awkward and every time gender comes up, I get uncomfortable. They notice. I mention my identity issues a couple times and they say they want to hear about them sometime when I feel comfortable. I’m thrilled to be able to relate to this person so much and desperately want to come out to them and be accepted by them. The most I can get out is that I don’t identify as a woman/girl, and that I worry a lot about my identity issues. I planned on making this person the first I’d fully come out to, eventually. Then they suddenly, unexpectedly decide we are not friends. No idea why, not sure if it’s personal.

Now I feel rejected by my own kind. If this person couldn’t accept me, who ever could? I’m terrified of coming out to someone and having them react in the same way. I feel so alone, defective, and unlovable. I feel as if the people who love me wouldn’t love me as much if they knew that I don’t want to be gendered the way they think of me. Rationally, I know this is untrue; my family knows a tiny bit about my identity issues and they still love me, and my best friend is 100% accepting of the few things she knows, even if she doesn’t understand. But I still can’t help feeling shitty about this repudiation by someone who I feel should be able to accept me.

I'm also really nervous about it. Nervous to the point of anxiety with fear mixed in. I'm worried about what other people will think of me. My brother and mom are supportive of my decisions, but I don't think my extended family will really understand... I'm also worried about friends' opinions or people I may meet in the future... And I know I really shouldn't worry about what they think. I just can't help but worry and wonder. Not to mention my extended family is really gossipy and fairly judgemental.

What I'm freaking out on aside from just that is the feeling of doubting myself, I know I want to bind my chest, and I don't entirely get why aside from the fact that I don't want to deal with having boobs. I also think sports bra's are alright at times, as well as tank tops with built in bra's, but I really don't like bra's anymore, and I have no intention of wearing them again. :/ 

I keep remembering about when I was a child how I'd always dress like a boy, and have short hair, and do more boyish activities. I even once told my mom I wanted to 'be a boy' when I grew up... I was even jealous that boys could walk around without their shirt on. (I still am now actually :P )

I've been dressing more masculine as of late, just like I did when I was a kid, and it makes me feel so happy and at ease and comfortable to do so again. It makes me think that maybe binding my chest may help me feel even more comfortable in my own skin. It also makes my heart race at the thought that I may even be transgender.... Which leads me to more anxiety. I think about what would happen if I was? What if I came out and later on realized I didn't feel that way anymore? What if I'm just thinking too much on all this? Or what if my extended family just judges me? What will other people think? Will I be able to handle all this on my own, or should I get a gender therapist? Those are all things that keep rolling around my mind right now...

I don't really know if I am possibly transgender right now... I know I'm okay with being a woman, but my constant questioning has really gotten me to wonder, feel fearful, have a bit of anxiety, and to actually start thinking more in depth about my gender and who I really am.

So...I guess what this all comes down to is I'm at a loss, how can I get rid of all this fear eating away at me? Where do I even start? Should I get a therapist for all this? It's too soon for me to know if I even intend to transition considering I'm so hesitant on everything right now. I feel so frustrated and stressed with all my confusion and questioning. 

Also, where in the world can I find a good chest binder for a good price?

But I have no idea where to even get a decent one for a decent price.\n\nI'm also really nervous about it. Nervous to the point of anxiety with fear mixed in. I'm worried about what other people will think of me. My brother and mom are supportive of my decisions, but I don't think my extended family will really understand... I'm also worried about friends' opinions or people I may meet in the future... And I know I really shouldn't worry about what they think. I just can't help but worry and wonder. Not to mention my extended family is really gossipy and fairly judgemental.\n\nWhat I'm freaking out on aside from just that is the feeling of doubting myself, I know I want to bind my chest, and I don't entirely get why aside from the fact that I don't want to deal with having boobs. I also think sports bra's are alright at times, as well as tank tops with built in bra's, but I really don't like bra's anymore, and I have no intention of wearing them again. :/ \n\nI keep remembering about when I was a child how I'd always dress like a boy, and have short hair, and do more boyish activities. I even once told my mom I wanted to 'be a boy' when I grew up... I was even jealous that boys could walk around without their shirt on. (I still am now actually :P )\n\nI've been dressing more masculine as of late, just like I did when I was a kid, and it makes me feel so happy and at ease and comfortable to do so again. It makes me think that maybe binding my chest may help me feel even more comfortable in my own skin. It also makes my heart race at the thought that I may even be transgender.... Which leads me to more anxiety. I think about what would happen if I was? What if I came out and later on realized I didn't feel that way anymore? What if I'm just thinking too much on all this? Or what if my extended family just judges me? What will other people think? Will I be able to handle all this on my own, or should I get a gender therapist?

Growing up, I've watched all of my friends mature and come into their own. Meanwhile, I was lost in a seemingly futile journey to self-discovery. 


Throughout my life, I've gone through a myriad of relationships with men, attempting to be ""normal"". I was desperate to comply with the stereotype. Becoming a mother at 18 broke my cycle of one-night stands and meaningless connections. I dedicated my life to caring for my daughter and decided that I needed to figure my shit out. I took a step back from everything and went through a period of self-reflection. A few months later I got my first real job, working for a prestigious communications company. 

Shortly after I started working, I met a girl. From the minute she walked into the room I knew she was different- confident yet not arrogant, stunningly beautiful, elegant, and graceful. She seemed to possess something that I wanted so badly, a calm comfort in the way she held herself. Over the next few weeks, we got to know each other. She was intelligent, witty, quite gay, and she had an uncanny ability to make me feel safe with her, something that was completely new to me.

I had always known I was a little bi-curious, but I had never explored it before. When I came out to her about my curiosity, nervous as all hell, she didn't hesitate to ask me out. Our first date was incredibly intimate; we instantly connected on a level that surpassed anything I had experienced before.

By far the most memorable moment of the night occurred half-way through dinner, when she casually came out to me as transgender. I was shocked because at the time I didn't know anything about trans* people and I had absolutely no idea that she wasn't cis. Fortunately, I'm not easily fazed and we still had a wonderful evening.

We've been together for seven months now. I came out to my family as gay for her (even though I'm pan... they are fairly black and white). My daughter calls her Myma (Mee-mah, mommy re-arranged). I've never been closer to anyone in my life. I've learned so much from her about self-exploration, being true to oneself, and about the LGBTQI community in general.

The one thing I value most about our relationship is our communication. We trust each other so deeply, and I've never felt safer with anyone. She's allowed me to open up and really delve down inside myself, and what I've found has left me with more questions than answers.

I now have the language to describe what I have always felt about myself. Though female bodied, I don't identify as a ""girl"", especially sexually... even though I do appreciate aspects of my femininity. Because my partner is exceptionally accepting I've been able to explore my more masculine side. I've started binding occasionally as well as packing. I feel like I've found something that I've been looking for my entire life. 

That said, I'm still having a hard time fully defining myself. While I'm not desperate for a label, I feel like I will eventually have to figure it out in order to progress and align my outward appearance with my inner self. 

I'm well aware that I'm not the only one with these feelings and questions. I'm left wondering where to go from here, and I welcome any thoughts, comments, and opinions. Thanks for listening!

I am a biological male seeking to hit a nice place in my gender expression between masculine and feminine.  My 6'6"" physique and other physical factors make this difficult at times, but like most of us I like to think that one way or another I find a way to manage.  I hang out here because it seems to be the most androgynous place on reddit, but (drumroll please for the pretentious declaration of how I essentially demand others utilize their language to identify me, oh damn, was that my speaking voice, sorry) I prefer to utilize the term gender-neutral.

Anyway, the reason I'm writing this post is that I'm simply curious if there are any others of you who, in addition to identifying as (insert gender identity here) happen to also identify yourself as Christian.

I do, and while I recognize that reddit as a whole has a tendency to be hostile toward Christianity, I'm simply curious if any of you identify as gender-ambiguous Christians and, if you do, how you work that out theologically, philosophically, scripturally, and in practice.

As for myself, I was raised a Southern Baptist, hung about garden variety north american evangelical churches for a few years and recently converted to Roman Catholicism.  I love theology and I'm fairly conservative, and I know that I always arrive at a few key issues in trying to intersect my gender identity with my faith.

Of course, there's the Leviticus prohibition on the wearing of the other gender's clothing, but I suppose it's easy enough to write that off as being a part of the law, and thereby not a necessary part of the new covenant in Christ.  There are some exegetical problems with writing things like that off, but that's one I can let slide.

Nonetheless, there are still passages in the New Testament which at the least seem to clearly imply that persons of separate gender should more or less be clearly distinguishable.  

Furthermore, it seems at least possible, and perhaps likely, that the writers of the new testament would have thrown intentional cross-gender or non-gender expression into the general lump of ""sexual immorality"" that they are more or less always declaring as belonging only to the realm of behaviors which are sinful.

Thus, while the scriptural text does not anywhere state ""men must wear pants and shall not upon any occasion wear skirts and makeup.  Neither shall any believer express ambiguous gender identity"", it does seem to at least generally hold gender expectations, especially those which are aesthetic, in a high regard.

On the other hand, there is the ever-wonderful passage in Galatians where, among other things, Paul states that ""now that all are in Christ"" there are no distinctions of race, class, or gender.  So maybe gender-neutral or cross gender expression is ""permissible, but not beneficial""?

Furthermore, at the base of all of these questions lies a kind of presupposition in one direction or another on the basic nature of gender-neutral or cross-gender sentiments.

It seems to me that one can evaluate cross-gender or gender neutral desires as 1) fundamentally a part of how God has created certain beings like myself (as more liberal theologians would be likely to say) 2) a ""natural"", inborn and not-chosen distortion of what is ""natural and good"", an indwelling sin which must be combatted i.e. psalm 51's ""in sin did my mother conceive me, in iniquity I was brought forth"" or 3) a psychological distortion which is the result of perhaps some abberant behavior at a point in my life, which is as such sinful and to be eradicated.

Somewhat obviously, I tend toward all of the interpretations of these matters that favor my gender-neutral expression and all of the suits, skirts, ties, nail-polish, cologne and makeup that come with it.  Nonetheless, I feel like I'm always holding these ideas in tension as a gender neutral person and a Christian.

I found my aunt.

Or rather... I found her obituary.  She died.  In *January*.  And they didn't tell me.

Sometimes I feel like I might be transgender, but I also like my body a lot so perhaps I have a dual gender identity. This sometimes makes me feel uneasy, and I feel torn between two different gender identities. I think I could be more content with who I am if I varied how I look throughout the year to allow the different parts of who I am to exist openly and freely. 

Another issue I am struggling with is I am attracted to a variety of gender presentations, I call myself bi-sexual (maybe I'm pansexual? I'm not clear on the terminology). I am trying to figure out who I want to be with sexually and romantically. I've never had sex or done anything sexual with anyone so it's hard for me to judge, somedays I am more sexually attracted to men or woman. I've only had monogamous relationships in my lifetime, so perhaps dating a man and a woman would work for me? I am romantically attracted to both genders. By the way I realize there are more than two genders, but for simplicity in my post I used the words male and female I hope nobody was offended. You are all beautiful!

32,2013-05-06 11:37:56,1dsc8v,6,1,"So. I recently found out that getting a prescription for testosterone in my area is pretty easy - there are local doctors who will go by the informed consent model, and all it would take would be an appointment or two with one of them. Of course, now that I have the opportunity to look more masculine and actually potentially be able to pass as not-a-girl (which I cannot currently do despite my best efforts) I am terrified.

Depending on how long it takes me to get an appointment with that doctor who's number I have, I could start taking T in a manner of weeks or months. It's quite likely that even on a low dose people will start being able to see changes by September when I go back to full time classes, and they will certainly be visible before I graduate from university.

But, unfortunately, I am completely outside of my element. I grew up with no genderqueer friends, very few genderqueer people at all actually and I came from a family that is fairly progressive but still a little regressive in their attitudes toward quote-unquote ""abnormal"" sexuality and gender.

So if you guys could throw me toward some resources on ""de-gendering"" my language, that would be extremely appreciated.

Some bleak reality seeped in to the initial euphoria I felt from figuring out that many of the issues I'd been dealing with for years upon years - or, rather, *not* dealing with for years upon years, and just letting these issues crush me down - were gender related.

If I could push a magic button and shift over to being the girl I see in my dreams, I'd probably fracture my hand from hitting that button so hard.  However, I think I'm too old for HRT to do much more than some mental tweaking, and have too many family responsibilities weighing on my remaining earning potential to take any surgical steps (FFS, BE, etc.) that the magic E-juice won't help with.

Over the past few days it's felt like the most I can ever do is to be an awkward ugly guy in a dress, in an environment where there'd be almost no support or acceptance for that, and probably even some physical danger - and it would cost me almost everything to get there.  However, the episodes of dysphoria are becoming more frequent, and some of the issues that the initial burst of gender euphoria helped break me free of are creeping back.  The zombie that I staggered around as a few months ago, suicidal but too numb to do anything about it, was creeping around the edges again where I'd hoped I'd left him farther behind than that.

Yesterday I got out of bed before dawn because I couldn't stay there any more and listen to the roiling chatter in my head, and I ran two miles.  I'd never done it before, but I'd read some people on this subreddit recommending it, and I had to try something.  The rest of the day was grey emotional turmoil, but it was at least bearable, if scary.  The monsters were there, but a little farther away.

Today I ran it again, and it seemed to calm things down a little more, make my negative view of the path ahead, while still there, seem a little less catastrophic.

So things are better, but I feel like I'm literally running away from a problem for the time being.

Depending on what state I move to, I might not be able to change it until I'm 24. But there wasn't any way around this because I am not out at work and I do not plan on coming out at work. It's just a temporary job to have while I'm in college.

The other problem this job has caused concerns that fact that I am transitioning with testosterone in June. I was only planning on being on it for a few months, so I was just hoping nobody at work would notice.  It still stressed me out though, because I want to be able to transition while fully embracing the changes, and not have to worry about what others would think of me. My managers would get suspicious and I would constantly have to monitor how I presented myself depending on who I was with. Some customers would gender me as a guy, while my coworkers would see me as a girl, while the regulars at the store would just be confused.

Which leads to the point of this post: I think I'm going to quit my job and get a desk job on campus. I would keep my job through the rest of summer but quit once the semester ends. Hours won't be as good, and the pay would be slightly less. However, my current pay already sucks. With a desk job, the pay sucks but I get to do homework or slack off during work. This gives me more time to focus on school, since my grades were horrible this year, as well as relax more my senior year. My rent at my apartment won't be so bad, and if I save up money over the summer I think I could actually save up enough to cover rent for the rest of my lease. The main drawback is that I won't be able to pay off the interest on my unsubsidized loans to prevent it from capitalizing after I graduate. My mother can also help me out financially, and I plan on coming out to her at the end of this month.

I don't think I'm even asking for advice, I just kind of want to post about it. Unless this is actually a horrible idea, in which case tell me. I could easily plan it out so that I start the name change process about the same time I submit taxes so there is no need to notify my old job about a name change. I honestly feel like this is the best option for me, even if it's not the best financial decision. I just want to see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

That's how I find myself attracted to guys. I'm attracted to them in a gay sort of way, and with girls, I'm attracted to them in a more straight sort of way. I don't really know how to describe it, it's just a relationship dynamic thing.

As a bit of a set up for this: I am a 15 year old giant of a woman living a life of Constant secrecy and silence as I go about my High School life. I already face constant harassment due to my silent lifestyle and sheer size ( I'm about 5""9-5""10 and about 279 pounds..but I distribute evenly and am very,very broad.) Since realizing my own gender-identity conflicts, I have become increasingly annoyed with any form of female term used towards me..especially ""ladies first"" or ""M'am"". I have begun to naturally ( and a bit sub-consciously) refer to myself by my last name, as my first name is very feminine and tend to wish to act very gentleman-like towards everyone.
I enjoy dressing in men's clothing as it fits my giant form much better than standard woman's clothing. :) But enough about that.
Here goes.

I am 15 years of age and have had a bit of a rough childhood. I have not been in very good shape for a good portion of my life and have been through severe bullying due to various weight and appearance issues. As a girl starting puberty in just the 5th grade, I could already tell that something was amiss. I even recall many failed (and embarrassing) attempts to be more feminine and even join in on what was popular for girls of my age. This included listening to the popular ""girl power"" music of the time and trying to dress in a more attractive way...which for a 10-11 year old wasn't very successful.
 All of my endeavors to ""fit in"" only made the taunting worse as I climbed through the grades. By the 6th grade my tormentors became relentless..I was pushed through the hallways, constantly verbally abused, had multiple objects thrown at me, which then they refused to touch..saying they had been ""contaminated"". I was shunned for being such a disgusting girl and as the years went by I secluded myself from everyone..Never speaking to any ""friendly"" face who tried to talk to me. I swore myself into silence, only speaking when necessary and trying not to fall back into previous depressions. From the 7th to the 8th grade I had come to the realization that I was bisexual, and by the end of the 8th grade fully realized what I had wanted to be all along. 

A boy.

I haven't considered myself a girl..or even a woman in about two years,and I have started to see the world around myself a lot better.
I have come to terms with myself and have found I would love to be male, feeling trapped in a female body and wishing to break free.
Especially after the main effects of puberty, I have loathed every single side effect of womanhood. 
I have know this since the age of around 13, fully realized it at age 14 and have been living and coping at now 15.

It has always been very hard for me to make friends and socialize, even to my own family members or at group events. I find myself stuttering and rubbing my hands when nervous, never being able to find the right words. I become anxious easy..paranoid and am very prone to panic attacks now.

Due to all this, no matter how much I'd like to tell them ( my family, or more so my parents)..I can't.
I come from a slightly religious family..not too overpowering or bearing down on me..but I suppose moderate.
 I had stopped believing in any sort of god, holy spirit etc. years ago and it has always made me uncomfortable at the mention of god or at the question of god towards me.
Lately, I have often been wondering what it would be like should I tell my parents, specifically my father, about all of the secrets I've kept from him for years..my bisexuality, my non-belief in a god, and now my wish to be a male. 

I play out all the different scenarios in my head..confronting him, sending him a letter or a e-mail..and they all turn out bad..
I have no way of knowing how he will react..and it scares me.
I know that he won't disown me..but I'm scared he will speak badly of me to family..or behind my back..though I know he is better than that and I love him.
I'm just scared..I'm scared of telling him the truth. He knows ( I would guess) that I'm not a socially comfortable person. ( though he always seems shocked/surprised whenever I show some sign of discomfort in public)..and to him I've always ""Loved my childhood"".. Despite all of the agony I've faced..all the times I've attempted suicide when the tormenting was too much for me..all this I've never told him. ( and if you are still reading this far, Don't worry, I no longer have any suicidal thoughts.)

He's always seen my as ""his little girl"" and, though he says he will love me no matter what I do in life, I'm afraid he will have a hard time accepting the fact that ""his little girl"" now wants to be ""his little boy""..
But when I think about it, this isn't even the hardest part..
My mother is very religious, always speaking about god and angels.
Everything is a blessing and a miracle and we where all put on this earth for a reason.
My parents divorced, so my mom hadn't really been in the picture when I was 7, and had been ""off-and-on"" with our family throughout that until age 13 when she started making more of a effort.
My mother has a tendency to be very...emotional and often over-exaggerated things. Though I love her, coming out to her is the scariest of the tasks.

I feel like she will be the most judgmental, as I already know she has suspicions of me and my sister being lesbians ( which we aren't fully)..but has never said anything directly to us..just whispers to our eldest sibling. I still feel a intense feeling of judgement from her when I visit. I feel like she still thinks that of me, and I can't shake it. I feel like I'm constantly being looked upon by my appearance..and not being the beautiful young woman she always wanted me to be. Instead she has a un-clean, giant of a ""woman"" who is into monsters and horror stories..the opposite of you or what you wanted. I never feel like she will accept me fully as a personality or a person..

I feel like my life could be better if I confessed..I just don't know how.
I feel like if I did, I would be bombarded with "" no you aren't, get over yourself"" from my father and ""That's not true!"" from my Mother. ( who I then feel would tell all her friends about it, but in a more dramatic way).
I have a older sibling I could attempt telling before any of my parents, but they are so busy now-a-days it would be hard for me to find the chance..I also have developed major trust issues..and while I love them, I feel like they wouldn't hesitate to tell my Father when I have left..and I simply wouldn't be prepared to face the reactions.

I can only think of one other person to tell and that is one of my best friends from younger years.
we've been friends since about the 1st-2nd grade and have been a little off-and-on through the years in terms of communication, but have recently gotten back together and are very,very good friends.
I've recently told him that I was a Atheist, and he didn't even mind. and. He still was my friend despite that.
I feel like I may be able to tell him more then, everything even..if I could get a hold of him on a weekend.
I've had a thought where I would invite him to the park and sit him down, after speaking for a little while I would tell him to listen very carefully..because what I have to say was very important and not to breath what I say to another soul. I would then tell him everything.

Though, of course, in my mind, he was always accepting.
He's always been so laid back, I feel like he would be alright should I tell him..but I still have that seed of doubt in my head.
I have a push telling me to do it soon before it's too late..because If I live with this too long, I may never have the chance to tell anyone and end up living trapped and unhappy forever.

So that's it and all I have to say. I've summed up a lot of it to avoid making this too long..but I'm afraid this has ended up into a novel-sized text and I'm really sorry about that. 
So what I'm asking you Reader, if you can, what is your advice to me and my situation? Where do I go from here? How do I proceed? I'm so sick and scared..and am very tired of living like this.
Thank you very much for reading.

My uni just got out and it suddenly hit me...the people I really got along with have moved back home for the summer and aren't available for routine friend-time! *scoff*

So, dear /r/genderqueer, will you guide me and potentially other bored and lonely GQ/Trans identified persons to a place where we can chat, be merry, and form longish-term friendships with each other?

Or even just be PM-pals?

PS: Now that I think about it, I feel like a static location for GQ/Trans social resources would be really useful. If this does not exist, would anyone be interested in making this happen?

PPS: Does an ""okcupid""-esque friendship site really not exist yet? Project, anyone?

**EDIT (05/14/2013)**: So after posting this topic, I seriously started to think about developing a site kind of like a platonic OkCupid. While this idea feels like something that should have already been done, I can't really seem to find sources that it has. 

This also sort of goes along with a project a friend and I were talking about a few months ago and I'm seriously considering borrowing their web dev experience and seeing what we could possibly build.

So mainly, this edit is asking if any other devs or amateur programmers would be interested in helping get something like this created. If so, PM me and we can try to set up an IM room to dialogue about the feasibility of such a venture.

Or, if your just bored and wanna chat, PM anyway. I can't guarantee that I'll be replying to this thread much in the future.

I have a stereotypically fit/muscular male body and am fairly attractive in a ""cute"" way rather than a sexy masculine way, ie. I have a young looking face.  I used to be self-conscious about this despite also feeling good that I was attractive in someway.  It took me forever to realize that people actually thought I was attractive, basically I only gained confidence in my looks the past 1.5 years.  






**Now** I am the opposite, I am very happy that I have very little facial hair and body hair because I think androgyny is especially beautiful despite being able to recognize beauty in binary forms as well.  When I see androgynous guys (not fem ""fabulous"" gay guys, but more like guys you could actually mistake for the opposite sex due to potentially make up, hairstyle, and clothing style) I want to be like them and I basically develop crushes because I want them to tell me their secrets of how to live life that way to be honest.  











**I** am basically bored/frustrated (not dysphoric) with my masculine look and feel it doesn't fit me.  Masculine mannerisms don't really fit me all that well either, meaning I don't want to have to be ""the man"" in any specific scenario, I would rather just be me and if that means someone who is more submissive and feminine then I want that to be ok.  I have been dealing with a lot of frustration because I feel lesser than other guys who are super alpha male (feeling jealous that they can comfortably identify that way and I can't) but I also realize that I fucking HATE that attitude/way of presenting yourself.  I figure I am mostly frustrated because I associate that attitude with confidence and success.  I hate it but am ashamed that I can't emulate it and therefore will always be a failure in some way (despite succeeding in almost everything in my life due to a great family and parents).











**I** feel dumb for suddenly wanting to dive into all this feminine stuff now, like why didn't I do it earlier in life if any of it will really make me happier and more secure with my identity (is it just that I have finally gone over the deep end with my porn fetishes?)?  I didn't have a bunch of girlfriends growing up, in fact virtually all my friends have been male and only recently have I developed significant friendships with girls.  I liked sports as long as I didn't have to be overly aggressive which meant that despite my athleticism I could just not get my shit together for football and wrestling (why I wasted my time on that stuff instead of other things like gender modification that are interesting to me now I will never know, ok I liked the fit body it gave me and I was a huge conformist) But I am going to experiment and stop worrying if what I do is masculine or feminine and just be me.




**As** for sex: I have only had a few partners, 2 guys and 1 girl.  I am potentially addicted to porn and fantasy (my orgasms from it are much stronger than with partners, but I haven't been with someone who I was TRULY attracted to on an emotional and physical level yet) which is probably at this point 75% trans or cd, 10% lesbian, 15% gay.  I am not even sure what is a fetish and what is more normal anymore but I suppose it doesn't matter all that much because its a part of me either way.  




**I** used to think that I was fantasizing about being the dominant one when viewing these things, but I now I realize that I fantasize about being the submissive one 95% of the time.  I basically imagine myself in the feminine role, but I am not sure if its because the tabooness of being emasculated is turning me on or if its that I just like the idea of giving up my masculinity to someone else and embracing whatever is left with them.




**I** don't really feel like I fit in with gay dudes that well because two dudes getting it on is not hot to be me unless there is major differences in femininity and masculinity between the two partners which could be represented with big age differences or with one person representing and dressing femininely.  I used to feel super ashamed for wanting to be in this role sexually, but recently I have been like fuck it, I am going to just follow my desires.  I like forced fem stuff as well.  I have never cross-dressed and don't have a specific urge to, but I do want to explore how feminine I can make my face and potentially fem up my clothes a little in terms of fit and style.




**But** lets say I grow my hair out and thin my frame up and learn how to feminize my face ect.  My career goal is not a fucking fashion photographer or owner of ""insert random hip store/item line"" or an artist or even someone who gets by on low wage jobs where people don't give a shit what you look like.  I want to be in healthcare, specifically I want to be a dentist.  How am I suppose to develop a patient base and relate to them when the vast majority of society still thinks anyone who doesn't fit into gender roles is ""weird"" and therefore lesser.  What if changing myself gets me rejected from the interviews or I can't even attract patients because my appearance is to non-normative.  There doubts are weighing heavily on my mind at the moment.  



**Either** way I will DEFINITELY explore this interest of mine.  If it turns out to be more of a passing curiosity or just a form of sexual fulfillment (maybe I am just a fem gay boy in denial, even though I am already out as queer) then I can probably just compartimentalize it, but if it turns out I really like presenting myself this way it could lead to problems in the future.  I have an aggressive social side to me at times but generally I don't deal with criticism or bullying well at all (I have always blended in and didn't have to grow a thick skin basically) and am afraid of running away like a little bitch if anyone attacks me (or even mentions that I am weird) for representing differently.

**~ Back Story ~**

I was always having trouble identifying who I was as a person. I have had issues with my identity since I was 14 and began high school and possibly even before then as well when I was 11 (that's when the thoughts started to appear). I had always worn boy's clothes up until I was 14 (my parents were awesome and had no issues buying them for me). I had been made fun of a lot when I had turned 13, and when high school hit, I had enough of it so I decided to wear women's clothing (but a few sizes too big). 

Ever since the beginning of high school, I was questioning who I was. The women's clothes bothered me a lot. The summer before I started high school, I had gotten drunk at a beach party and ended up kissing one of my friends, and I had really enjoyed it, but was so confused. I had been called a lesbian throughout my entire high school career (even though I had a boyfriend for the first half of it), it was just a mess. 

Now, I am 21 going on 22 in the summer. I had come out as bisexual last Fall to everyone who was on my Facebook. A lot of people were supportive and didn't really get any negative feedback other than a few of my guy friends had made some rude ""joking"" comments about three sums etc. I was always still struggling with my identity even though coming out as bisexual helped a little. Gender-fluidity has truly given me the insight I needed to help identify who I am as a person and I have never been so happy. I truly feel that I am both genders on different days or sometimes both in one, and I am so happy that the way I feel about myself exists among others as well.



**~ Getting to the Point ~**

I just had some questions as to how to, well, go forward? I realize that I should just continuing being myself, but now that I feel comfortable with myself, I wanted to figure out ways in order to be more masculine since I have been hindering myself on the days that I do and it really sucks. I have longer, past-the-shoulders blonde hair (that I absolutely LOVE and would hate cutting) but I have seen suggestions like putting it under a hat or something to that effect. I rarely wear make up as it is. In terms of men's clothing, I would just wear shirts and then women's pants since I couldn't fit in the men's pants because I am too skinny. I'd just like some suggestions.

**TL;DR: I am a 21 year old, biological woman, and I have identified myself as gender-fluid today and it has made me feel comfortable with myself.

As open minded, well rounded and liberal as I am, I hadn't heard those terms. I read the context clues and figured out what he meant. 

The first thing I did was affirm him that we love him because he is ours, not because he is our hetero son. We love him because he's funny, he's smart, kind, intelligent and so much more. His gender identity, his sexual orientation are non-issues for us. He's been a part of many conversations in our home where we have expressed our feelings about this topic. People are people. Sexuality is complicated. We understand that...even if both of us are cisgender and hetero. Intellectually, and emotionally, we understand that for many, many people it's just not this simple. 

He wants to take the summer to experiment a bit. Grow out his hair etc. Which we are totally okay with. Even if we don't know how to guide him...how to support him.

I've been a lurker on reddit for months. Finally registered recently. And this is one of my only posts. Having read through this sub all day today...I feel safe asking for your advice and perspective. 

I would love to hear your experiences coming out to your parents...what they did right, what they could have done better etc. 

I want to do right by my child. Several months back, I was reading another story in the news about a teen who came out as homosexual...his parents kicked him out, basically disowned him. He committed suicide. I remember crying and crying and saying out loud...even though I was alone...'Sometimes I wish I had a child like this. I know I would love them anyway. I know that I would do everything in my power to help them feel loved, accepted, cherished, and safe to be exactly who they are.' 

Fast forward a few months...and here I am. So far, it seems he's baby stepping. He shaved his arms and legs on Sunday. On Monday I hinted that I have a very nice, if older, dress that might fit him...if he wanted to try it out. His response was 'Cool. I might do that.' 

How can I help him figure this out? How can I support him? Where can I take him dressed as a girl, that he will be accepted? How do I thicken his skin so that what insensitive family members or well-meaning friends say, doesn't cut so deep? 

And how the hell do I find the strength to not fucking care what people think about my child? How do I let it go when someone judges him a freak? When someone I consider a friend or loved one says something asinine? How in the world do I handle that? I know I can be strong and walk away...but I don't ever want him to know that it hurts me when people hurt him. He's sensitive enough that he might revert to not exploring, or to repressing, if he thinks I'm hurting or suffering on his behalf. How do I be a rock for him?

I dated a woman, let's call her ""Jay,"" for almost two years and we broke up just under 2 years ago.  During our relationship, she was always pretty touchy about my gender presentation.  Even liking something that was colored pink caused her to freak out a bit.  

I started coming out about a month ago and I planned on waiting until next week when I'd be a bit more comfortable with everything and I'd be done with graduation etc.  I'll spare the details, but she ended up finding out from her old boss (who manages the concert hall on campus--who I know, but speak to very rarely) via e-mail.

This was all a day or two ago but Jay and I actually spoke about it tonight.  Understandably, she's pretty worked up about it.  I can sympathize and empathize with the confusion and mixed feelings, and I want to make things as easy as possible for her.  My real problem is that she seems to be jumping to a lot of conclusions, namely that parts or all of my feelings for her/our relationship were fake in one way or another.  This is absolutely not the case. 

She kept turning things around on me.  It seemed like she wasn't sure what she wanted to say or ask at the beginning, so I said to her that none of this changes how I felt about her etc. and then she chastised me for being presumptuous.  She was condescending and saying things like ""you need to understand how this affects other people, you need to help them through it.""

I haven't told my parents yet (but I do on Saturday. huzzah!), and I've only been at this a month. 

I've been thinking about my family too.  They're very accepting people, but there's going to be some hard emotions and a sense of loss for them, I know. 

I want to be as supportive and helpful as I can for people, but I don't think I should have to hold their hand through it.  I mean, this is a lot harder for me than anyone else. If anything, shouldn't there be people holding my hand?  I mean, I'm holding it together, but it's taking all I've got.

I have some ideas if you guys want to make it a more regular thing.

One: We should have suggested topic(s) that we come up with beforehand. This gives us introverts in the audience time to think about what we might like to say. Of course, we can open up the floor to questions, concerns, and updates from one another.

The topics chosen should relate in some way to gender identity and presentation, simply because this is the one thing we all have in common. Some tangents are fine, but some structure is a very good thing.

Two: I felt that there were two separate conversations going on at once- stuff happening on cam and stuff happening in the chat. It would be nice if we all tried to listen and respond to everyone.

Mic/Cam not required, but it might be fun to see your lovely/handsome/beautiful/cute/attractive face!

We are going to start at 8 PM EST on Friday, March 24. I will be on from 8 till 9, possibly longer.

The first bit is going to be a loosely moderated discussion. Our theme will be *identity*.

Who are you? Who are you becoming? What led you to your current state of self-awareness?

What are the words you use to describe yourself? Do the words vary depending on audience, place, time, or other factors?

Who is your 'my-your-me'? That's the person YOU think that OTHERS see you as. For example, I think people in certain situations may believe I am a butch lesbian. This is totally not in line with how I view myself, and may not be how others actually view me. Do your thoughts of how others may view you color how you present yourself? If so, how?

Is there a 'real you'? Could there be more than one, or none at all?

The Rules!

-You do not have to talk! You can just lurk, if you like.

-Whether or not you talk, please listen respectfully to others.

-You can use either cam, text chat, or both!

-All are invited! Queer, Cis, Questioning, Llamas, you name it!

I just don't consider it a deciding factor for the way any other aspect of my life is. I dress the way I want. I dress in clothes that fit and look good on my body. I have a fairly androgynous style, though sometimes I will dress more feminine or masculine depending on my mood.

I'm going through pictures of myself on Facebook from this past weekend and I think, ""In all the pictures of me where I'm wearing women's clothing, I look absolutely ridiculous."" Maybe this is not so much a case of dysphoria as it is body-image issues. 

I look fat. Plain and simple. Women's clothing is typically designed to show off our curves. Some clothing is designed to flatter them. 

I am pretty fit (not to be confused with skinny), so I dress in a way that I think shows off my body without being too feminine. I usually wear skinny jeans and a tank or a t-shirt, and a plaid button down shirt. I guess I forget how wide my hips are or something, because when I look in the mirror, I like my body. I'm not too curvy (or so I think), so I imagine I can get away with looking androgynous while wearing skinny jeans. I guess not. Pictures tell a different story than the mirror. I have big hips. And I'm fat. And when I wear women's clothing, I look ridiculous because I don't have a particularly feminine body, even though I'm a healthy, fit female.

I got these black skinny jeans that fit me like a glove. I thought they showed off my super muscular thighs. I thought no other pants fit me as well as these. No. They just just accentuate my fat thighs and big hips. 

Today I put on boy's jeans and a wife-beater (is there another word for those tank tops? what a terrible word..). I felt good about the way I look today. 

I'm just feeling really down. I don't know what I am anymore. I guess this is more of a body acceptance issue than a genderqueer one? Maybe both? I'm confused about myself. I can't distinguish my feminine curves from fat. 

I don't really know what I'm asking. Maybe somebody could help shed some light or relate or give me some perspective? Or an opinion? What ever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Part One: The Road Less Travelled By

If I could go back nothing would change. It’s funny how the thorns that has dug into my emotional state for so long could be attached to flowers so precious, so beautiful, I’d gladly experience the pain again, no matter how great the feeling of a smooth life of it would be. But perhaps troubles create preciousness? If abnormal were normal, and normal is the worst punishment of all, should I ever really want my “abnormal” to conform to something I’ve so often thought of as a shallow disguise to fit in with an ever changing flow because “difference is scary” in the “everyone else is doing it” generation.

But it’s not a generation is it? Thousands of years of an ever changing cut and paste. Everything’s changing except what we want, and what we want is the status quo of what we understand, because majority rules, and the majority calls for oppression. Hiding behind a veil of “progressiveness” just because you treat one group slightly less like the dirt you wiped off your shoe. Equal rights are oppression of the majority, but excusing their faults cause ours are more grave. Love isn’t love anymore, love is a conditional response, and I haven’t fulfilled the requirements.

I tried to fill these conditions once. I submitted my claim, but time said no, and I was cast back into a searching tunnel with no flashlight. But when I find a little glimpse of light, I can’t follow it because our lights don’t “complement” each other. Because no one cares if it leads to the destination because my path isn’t the “right one.” I think Robert Frost had the right idea in that road less travelled by.

The path is rough, and the world throws rocks at the travelers. High school opened the door to it, but it slammed behind me. I never felt the path was wrong, but I knew as soon as I went through the arch I knew what I was going to leave behind. And so we’ve come full circle, because I tried my best to love, but did those I love do it back of their own accord or another condition? And once the door closed, the fear set in, that I broke the contract and lost it all, because my conditions were no longer met. So enough of the allegories, because this isn’t a veil, this is my reality. A reality where there’s no conditions, and the word “gender” means nothing but an arbitrary label of preference.

Part 2: A Monster Called Gender

Who could’ve forseen the irony of where it’d all begin? Under the watchful eye of those that would condemn me, my life changed instantly. His name is not important, but his presence was the only catalyst that mattered. In a world where everyone told me that it was wrong, it was the only thing at the moment that felt right. All I was taught was fear and pain and unquestioning obedience, but the moment with him was an oasis, no different than any moment I felt with a she. And the only thing that had felt so right in so long, brought forth the terrible realization of a world that’s so wrong.

Now let me make it clear, make no mistake, not once did I feel conviction for my path. But those that were the closest to me, or were they ever really close? Could I ever truly be close to those that would be the first to condemn the feelings of intuition. It was a fear, a fear so great that it clawed at the edges of my mind, screaming to be let out, yet it screamed in silence as I droned about school life. Being a “good Christian boy” during the day time, keeping the monster in quiet submission as I was taught to lead unquestioningly, because questioning was only a fast-track to damnation. And yet at night I could drop the façade, and meet up with him, feeling a sincere and innocent embrace that felt as though the monster of my fear were not just silence, it was a metamorphosis. The same thoughts in a different lens, where gender meant nothing, where even I could escape the cold gripping hands of the roles I was so often enduring.

But the transformation was just a temporary solution, and it returned in the day. Every day it grew stronger like a poison spreading through the veins of my thoughts. And like a ripping wound the pain grew and festered, until one day it punctured my heart. And the breeze was cold. A moment that cannot be written so eloquent, as would ruin its justice. For this was the most ineloquent and destructive, yet powerful and saving moment of my life. 

The breeze was cool, and search for no poetical language, what I say now is as literal as anything.  The window sill was large enough to seat me comfortable, but there was no comfort in any part of this moment. The ledge I sat on quickly began to feel like a lifting slope, threatening to slide me into the depths of the concrete below. But I was my own catalyst, and what I had grown to believe was the biggest threat of all. But could this be it? I stared down 5 stories and realized that the end I so bitterly sought, wasn’t what I sought at all. What I sought was an end, an end to gender. And the trip began slowly, painfully, and with much resistance, but I’ve learned so much, on how to live without it.

Part 3: Genderqueer?

It’s amazing how long something can hide. Feelings so ingrained from the beginning that I could remember, that I didn’t belong. “Boy” “son” “one of the guys” “dude” like mismatched labels being forced into the hole that didn’t fit. And yet why was I so often called it? Always being told what I should like, and what I should do.  Cars, workouts, and sports, as though there were a mold to fit everyone. And yet I was told there was only black and white, two opposites, the boy and girl. But with only two hemispheres, why did I feel like I didn’t fit on the map? It was as though black and white were all the same shade of grey. 

Is this why I couldn’t belong? Who could I tell? All my feelings cast aside in the name of redemption? And yet mind and body in a mismatch by the coercion of everything I had been taught. A match for positive and negative, but is love really all you need, when the one you love is a forbidden shade? In an ever changing test of loves endurance, harder by the minute, rewarding by the second.

Years have passed reversing through the window that almost closed the book. So much has changed, like a new lens fixed into my perception. Suddenly a black and white world so full of color. And suddenly I realize perhaps my love is not colorblind, but the love of all color, the ability to come close to the inherent preciousness of every color. And yet one has caught my eye, no not one color, but one person so precious, every color shines through. A love that colors could intertwine, a mixture of pure joy and innocence. And yet there was a color missing. In a world so full of color, could I still only see my shade of grey?

And yet I could never have forseen the liberator of my own colorless feelings. The kindness of a stranger, found through a simple connection of having left behind the same vice grip of condemnation. Pushing myself out of my shell, to see what I could truly be. It wasn’t a big store, but it had exactly what was needed to get a glimpse of the color hiding underneath the façade forced upon me from an assigned birth. 

Sizes too small, sizes too big, breaking the binary was hard to calculate. And yet it was such a wonderful time. Outfits of color, dropping the forced idea of masculinity, and yet feeling no femininity, but only me. Knowing full well I could be called “fag” “drag queen” and other useless empty words from the closed mind of indoctrination. But for those brief moments, full of laughter and blushing, skirts and v-necks, tops and capris, everything felt ok.

Everything felt as though it fit. The pieces matched, the colors fit, the binary shell I wore was gone. For those moments I could be me. And I can spare no thanks, no circular language for these individuals. And so it is with the ending of an ineloquent rant about the ineloquent past of genderblind genderqueer being shown true colors, I thank the ones that I have led me here. I thank Zach, though we speak little now, and though our encounter was rough around the edges, it pushed me to think, despite everything around us saying no. I thank all of those that have helped and supported me throughout my development, as you’re all too numerous to name, but to close to forget. I thank you Colleen for giving a stranger such kindness to feel alright with myself, and be able to see the color behind the binary the world has assigned me, it was one of the biggest steps in accepting myself. And finally I thank Sam, the wonderful colorbringer that has melded so well with me, and given me the most vibrant of colors in the purest of love, where I would not be today without, though we may be far away, our colors are never separate, and nothing can pull them away as we journey together to keep our colors, and show the world that gender is not a make it or break it condition, but love and only love. Because why the world may not believe it, and while it may be hard, it’s really really true.

127,2013-05-27 00:50:56,1f3zhg,24,8,"Hi,

My basic question is that once you started questioning your gender, how did you stop yourself from just going ""oh I am trans obviously, if I don't fit into the binary I am in right now"".  And do you wish you were fully trans or completely comfortable with your assigned gender, rather than somewhere in between?

I [M20] started questioning my gender recently.  I cross-dressed and put some make up recently for the first time and loved it.  I incorporated it into my sex life and it improved it a lot, I found it easier to fantasize in a feminine role sexually when I had the trappings.  I felt very pretty in general and loved my feminine look.

I tend to think very black and white when dealing with personal identity, which I realize is kind of the antithesis of self-discovery and ""take things as they are"".  When I started to think about gender and why I liked reading about trans/gender non-binary stuff so much, I jumped immediately to thinking I'm trans, which logically I know is a little niave.

I don't really feel dysphoric, I am just not attached to my maleness much anymore at this point in my life, except that I know that it comes off well to others and allows me to be successful in my goals without any extra work or dealing with intolerance.

So, I guess, would it be weird of me to be disappointed that I am not trans and maybe just somewhere in the middle?  It would be more comfortable for me to know that I am ""this"" or ""that"" rather than this undefined thing in the middle that could be anything and is very hard for people to relate to.

And also, how do I know this all isn't just a phase because I am bored with life (seems a shallow way to live life)?

I incorporated it into my sex life and it improved it a lot, I found it easier to fantasize in a feminine role sexually when I had the trappings.  I felt very pretty in general and loved my feminine look.\n\nI tend to think very black and white when dealing with personal identity, which I realize is kind of the antithesis of self-discovery and ""take things as they are"".  When I started to think about gender and why I liked reading about trans/gender non-binary stuff so much, I jumped immediately to thinking I\'m trans, which logically I know is a little niave.\n\nI don\'t really feel dysphoric, I am just not attached to my maleness much anymore at this point in my life, except that I know that it comes off well to others and allows me to be successful in my goals without any extra work or dealing with intolerance.\n\nSo, I guess, would it be weird of me to be disappointed that I am not trans and maybe just somewhere in the middle?  It would be more comfortable for me to know that I am ""this"" or ""that"" rather than this undefined thing in the middle that could be anything and is very hard for people to relate to.\n\nAnd also, how do I know this all isn\'t just a phase because I am bored with life (seems a shallow way to live life)?\n\nThanks.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'How did you know you were not trans or not part of the binary?', 'created': 1369641056.0}",99.0

Around February of this year, in my last semester of Undergrad, I decided, ""Fuck it, Imma do what I want.""  I'm a biological male, 6'6"" and with a very masculine form, but I decided to start openly wearing makeup, nail polish and whatever clothes I wanted to.  For a solid three months I had a terrific experience expanding my own horizons and getting comfortable in my own skin and in my own ambiguous gender identity.  I learned in those months that there are such things as comfort, acceptance and love for people like us.  There is peace and community and normalcy, in some contexts, when you just decide to do it and let yourself be yourself.

It culminated in going to my spring formal in a dress and patterned stockings.  All of my friends were supportive, and it was perhaps the best night I've ever had.  They were all supportive, a few girls complimented me on my style choices, and on the whole the night was glorious.  A week later I wore makeup and nail polish at graduation, and later when I went out to dinner I kept the makeup and nail polish and wore capris with the same patterned stockings I wore to formal.  It felt great.  Here I was, out in public, looking genuinely good in a gender-ambiguous way, comfortable with myself.

(by the way, Roberts Wesleyan College in Rochester, NY, where I attended, was a loving, accepting community.  Somewhat surprising for its conservative theological base, but worth stating and commending here)

Anyway, I didn't get into grad school so I had to move down to Mississippi to live with my Mom and Step-Dad.  I don't have a job yet, and I can't seem to get one yet, so I can't move out onto my own yet.

I've tried even wearing makeup around them, but it seems like every time I do I'm met with disapproval, criticism and outright scorn.  I love my Mom more than anyone else in the world, but it seems like I can't do anything outside of accepted gender binary without her reminding me that my gender-ambiguous behavior is harmful to my employment prospects and my lifelong success potential.  I want to say that she's wrong, but living in Mississippi she's probably right.

I feel like I've gone from living life in an open field to living in a small room.  I already have the shock that I'm not in college anymore (I'm working on getting into ""normal"" grad school to become a teacher now) and on top of that I have to find a way to deal with the fact that I can't dress myself and present myself how I want to if I'm to expect any measure of normal employment and fulfillment, I have to keep myself confined to the binary.

I know how to ""just do it"", I know how to get over societal conceptions and hold my head high in stockings and a denim skirt.  That's not the issue.

I don't know how to stare down the person who loves me the most and tell her that she's wrong when I know she isn't.

I don't know how to stare down the harsh realities of employment in the deep south and still manage to be myself.

Staying in the closet, pretending, isn't an option after what I learned back in college, but at the same time I feel like the expression I crave is similarly no longer a viable option for pursuing the path of life that I want.

I'm FAAB, always been kind of masculine. Mostly interested in women. For a while--after that period starting in middle school when I assumed I must've been straight--I identified as a butch mostly-lesbian (or a butch bisexual, but I have been leaning further for a while). But then, after learning about real transgender people on the internet, stuff has come flooding back. I've always been fascinated by transgender people, and where is my beard and what are *these*? 

I actually remember the *moment* I realized I was going to grow boobs. My (male, like all the others) friend brought it up, during grade school: ""What are you gonna do when you grow boobs?""

Horror. In my mind: ""Oh. My. God. I'm going to grow *boobs*. I mean--of course I am, how could I not have realized, but...no, please no. I don't want to. I can't. This isn't right. Am I going to have to call them breasts, too? Of course I will. And I'll have to be a *mom*. Please, God, anybody, no.""

I hate my body. Why am I so narrow and dainty? Why is my voice like this? This isn't what it's like in my head. My voice surprises me when I speak out loud. And where the heck is my beard? Aren't I supposed to be shaving by now? I want to shave. (Puberty was horrible. All the wrong things. Why did those people get to have the right things, and why did those other people get these things and like them? What's wrong with me?)

And of course the sexual stuff: I can't bear to imagine being the ""woman"" in these situations, but imagining being the ""man"", having the parts, is unimaginable relief, like wiggling out of a rope that has been cutting off circulation to my body for years. 

But I don't just want to be a *man*. I've cosied up to the idea of being a lesbian, and a butch one at that: I wear it on my sleeve, people see exactly what I am, and people like me (gay people, trans people, people who haven't had the standard straight, cisgender experience of sexuality) see me and recognize me. I know (if I recognize them) what it feels like, in part, to be them, and they know what it is like to be me. That thing when you were a kid? Oh my god me too! And all that shit that some ""normal"" people will throw at you many fewer of these people will throw at you. I do not have to explain myself to these people: They know already. And they *like* this part of me. I like the idea of being in the queer community and if I transition (and pass), while I might not lose being in the queer community, I will lose being there visibly. I will have to identify myself and even then I might not fit as well as some others.

I don't need to be read as a man, I just want the man's body. Does that make sense? I mean, even typing it that way feels weird--a man's body *is* my body. This thing is not my body, cannot be my body. (But this is what everybody sees when they look at me.) Ugh. 

I mean, there are some things that the world does when it reads me as female that I don't like--assuming that I'm interested in some ""girly"" things and not in some ""guy"" things, which it generally gets wrong, and other sex-related prejudices--but those things aren't about me being male or female in itself but about society's hangups. I could do without those. Without those, I might not not mind being read as female. However, I might not mind being read as male--might like being read as male--if I could also be read as gay or queer. (Also, how boring would it be to appear to the world to be a straight guy? That thought has me reeling. Just me leaving what I'm used to, though.)

Finding you people (not just the genderqueer people, but queers of all kinds) here on the internet has brought the light back into me. There are people like me and life doesn't have to be middle school. I don't want to leave that. 

So, I've been identifying as genderqueer for a while. I don't actually have my gender perfectly narrowed down, but I do know what body is the right body, and I do like the queer community. But I'm wondering if I'm basing my genderqueer identity not on my *gender* but on my desire to be more male than I am (from genuine instinct and dysphoria) minus my fear of actually transitioning, stemming from my reluctance to pull myself out of the queer community (which is less gender and more just lifestyle). I wonder if I should just be identifying as trans (like, binary trans). I don't know. 

Anyway. This has been rattling around in my head and threatening to poke a hole for a while. Thanks for listening, if you've gotten this far.

It always weirded me out trying to be ‘feminine’, and overly girly clothes made me uncomfortable, and just wound up making me feel “hyper-sexualized” in a way. 

Whenever I showed any curiosity about sexuality and gender it was also swiftly and harshly dealt with, and I quickly ""learned"" that it was bad, nasty or ugly and not to be explored or questioned. Which ofc lead to even more denial on my part.. the emotional abuse was enough as it was, both at home and at school. I didn’t fit anywhere..

I honestly have no idea.. this is all new and unexplored territory, and I've been spending a lot of time reading pretty much anything I can come across about these things.

Why should it bother me that I have girly sides? Aren’t I a girl after all? 

I don’t know.. I don’t really have any gender dysphoria going on either.. much.. I think.. I might have a bit of an issue with my boobs.

I don’t think I have any desire for a gender change, although I have wondered what it would be like to be a guy. I’ve had dreams about having ‘guy-parts’. Would I be a gay guy in that case?

135,2013-05-28 21:18:05,1f83kc,2,10,"First of all: I have no idea how I identify, but I’m XX, and present as such, but the societally expected gender identity to match that has not developed. At this point I’ve ruled out identifying as cisfemale, woman, or man. Female is more accurate than male, but woman is no more accurate than man. Agender seems to be the best-fitting term I’ve found so far. I don’t really seek out fellow queer people because my social circle is diverse and accepting… but I do feel like I lack understanding with most of my friends. I also don’t really fit the mold of the queer culture here.

About two years ago, I met the first person I knew to identify as genderqueer. I had previously known plenty of gay/lesbian/bisexual people, as well as a handful of trans* people (i.e. 2), but this was probably my first real experience with an out non-binary person. I was pretty excited to find somebody else who liked to bind sometimes, liked different pronouns sometimes, etc. She was how I learned the term “genderqueer.” So we hung out a couple times, never really became friends because she moved away a couple of months after we met. No big deal, we didn’t have much else in common anyway. 

Fast forward two years, multiply my identity issues by 920, and I meet another genderqueer. This time I’m not so much drawn to the “exoticism” of their non-binary presentation as the glimpses of myself I see in this person. This is a little disturbing to me (mostly because they usually present as male) and magnifies my identity issues. It simultaneously felt SO GOOD and SO BAD to be around this person. Over several months, we sort of become friends. It’s incredibly awkward and every time gender comes up, I get uncomfortable. They notice.

Then they suddenly, unexpectedly decide we are not friends. No idea why, not sure if it’s personal.

Now I feel rejected by my own kind. If this person couldn’t accept me, who ever could? I’m terrified of coming out to someone and having them react in the same way. I feel so alone, defective, and unlovable. I feel as if the people who love me wouldn’t love me as much if they knew that I don’t want to be gendered the way they think of me. Rationally, I know this is untrue; my family knows a tiny bit about my identity issues and they still love me, and my best friend is 100% accepting of the few things she knows, even if she doesn’t understand. But I still can’t help feeling shitty about this repudiation by someone who I feel should be able to accept me.

I was pretty excited to find somebody else who liked to bind sometimes, liked different pronouns sometimes, etc. She was how I learned the term “genderqueer.” So we hung out a couple times, never really became friends because she moved away a couple of months after we met.

I'm also really nervous about it. Nervous to the point of anxiety with fear mixed in. I'm worried about what other people will think of me. My brother and mom are supportive of my decisions, but I don't think my extended family will really understand... I'm also worried about friends' opinions or people I may meet in the future... And I know I really shouldn't worry about what they think. I just can't help but worry and wonder. Not to mention my extended family is really gossipy and fairly judgemental.

What I'm freaking out on aside from just that is the feeling of doubting myself, I know I want to bind my chest, and I don't entirely get why aside from the fact that I don't want to deal with having boobs. I also think sports bra's are alright at times, as well as tank tops with built in bra's, but I really don't like bra's anymore, and I have no intention of wearing them again. :/ 

I keep remembering about when I was a child how I'd always dress like a boy, and have short hair, and do more boyish activities. I even once told my mom I wanted to 'be a boy' when I grew up... I was even jealous that boys could walk around without their shirt on. (I still am now actually :P )

I've been dressing more masculine as of late, just like I did when I was a kid, and it makes me feel so happy and at ease and comfortable to do so again. It makes me think that maybe binding my chest may help me feel even more comfortable in my own skin. It also makes my heart race at the thought that I may even be transgender.... Which leads me to more anxiety. I think about what would happen if I was? What if I came out and later on realized I didn't feel that way anymore? What if I'm just thinking too much on all this? Or what if my extended family just judges me? What will other people think? Will I be able to handle all this on my own, or should I get a gender therapist? Those are all things that keep rolling around my mind right now...

I don't really know if I am possibly transgender right now... I know I'm okay with being a woman, but my constant questioning has really gotten me to wonder, feel fearful, have a bit of anxiety, and to actually start thinking more in depth about my gender and who I really am.

So...I guess what this all comes down to is I'm at a loss, how can I get rid of all this fear eating away at me? Where do I even start? Should I get a therapist for all this? It's too soon for me to know if I even intend to transition considering I'm so hesitant on everything right now. I feel so frustrated and stressed with all my confusion and questioning. 

Also, where in the world can I find a good chest binder for a good price?

143,2013-05-30 05:52:34,1fbkv0,4,18,"Hi, I'm Emery. I'm 21 years old. I'm female assigned, but it's just never quite ""fit"" me. For years I have been searching for who exactly I am. Growing up, I've watched all of my friends mature and come into their own. Meanwhile, I was lost in a seemingly futile journey to self-discovery. 


Throughout my life, I've gone through a myriad of relationships with men, attempting to be ""normal"". I was desperate to comply with the stereotype. Becoming a mother at 18 broke my cycle of one-night stands and meaningless connections. I dedicated my life to caring for my daughter and decided that I needed to figure my shit out. I took a step back from everything and went through a period of self-reflection. A few months later I got my first real job, working for a prestigious communications company. 

Shortly after I started working, I met a girl. From the minute she walked into the room I knew she was different- confident yet not arrogant, stunningly beautiful, elegant, and graceful. She seemed to possess something that I wanted so badly, a calm comfort in the way she held herself. Over the next few weeks, we got to know each other. She was intelligent, witty, quite gay, and she had an uncanny ability to make me feel safe with her, something that was completely new to me.

I had always known I was a little bi-curious, but I had never explored it before. When I came out to her about my curiosity, nervous as all hell, she didn't hesitate to ask me out. Our first date was incredibly intimate; we instantly connected on a level that surpassed anything I had experienced before.

By far the most memorable moment of the night occurred half-way through dinner, when she casually came out to me as transgender. I was shocked because at the time I didn't know anything about trans* people and I had absolutely no idea that she wasn't cis. Fortunately, I'm not easily fazed and we still had a wonderful evening.

We've been together for seven months now. I came out to my family as gay for her (even though I'm pan... they are fairly black and white). My daughter calls her Myma (Mee-mah, mommy re-arranged). I've never been closer to anyone in my life. I've learned so much from her about self-exploration, being true to oneself, and about the LGBTQI community in general.

The one thing I value most about our relationship is our communication. We trust each other so deeply, and I've never felt safer with anyone. She's allowed me to open up and really delve down inside myself, and what I've found has left me with more questions than answers.

I now have the language to describe what I have always felt about myself. Though female bodied, I don't identify as a ""girl"", especially sexually... even though I do appreciate aspects of my femininity. Because my partner is exceptionally accepting I've been able to explore my more masculine side. I've started binding occasionally as well as packing. I feel like I've found something that I've been looking for my entire life. 

That said, I'm still having a hard time fully defining myself. While I'm not desperate for a label, I feel like I will eventually have to figure it out in order to progress and align my outward appearance with my inner self. 

I'm well aware that I'm not the only one with these feelings and questions. I'm left wondering where to go from here, and I welcome any thoughts, comments, and opinions. Thanks for listening!
