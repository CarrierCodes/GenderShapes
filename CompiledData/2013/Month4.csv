I am scared of losing my sex drive, especially as my fantasies are very masculine in nature; in fact, because they are so masculine, I feel like I am genderfluid sometimes. But I never want to present male in public.

I also feel guilty for my fantasies sometimes;

* I am into BDSM, and love being able to penetrate. I know I could use a strapon, but I have no idea if that would have the same effect for me, let alone someone who would accept it as an alternative; let alone any lesbian who would be willing to accept a transwoman :/ (This is because I am homoflexible, and do not like standard bodies of men. I don't know if this is because it just reminds me of my own body.) 

* I am into DaddyDom / Ageplay, and I am into rape play. (I realize this can look very bad, but I do not want to do anything with anyone except adults and 100% consensual.)

I want to just start HRT but I know that its something that I can't exactly reverse. Any advise would be helpful!

TL,DR: I am a pre-everything transwoman scared of losing sexual desires/fantasies, or worse yet, keeping them when I can never again act them out. Is this irrational?

As an amusing anecdote: before I was able to submit, the captcha was:

HRTFOU

HRT for you

I've been getting a huge boost lately from exploring outside the gender box I and everyone else assumed for me since birth based on what was between my legs.  There didn't seem to much of a downside to it, except for some stress of working things out with my spouse and the odd panic attack when I stopped myself from enjoying the things I'd been trying.

Last night I was at a meeting in an old mansion, and afterwards was waiting in their entry area for someone else to finish some after-meeting conversations.

I finally found a spot away from the reflections and stood there until I could leave, feeling very freaked out.

All that evening at home I found myself turning my eyes away from mirrors.  When I woke up and had to put in my contact lenses I was OK with my eye right against my reflection, but as I pulled back and saw my whole body I felt this strong reaction and almost ripped the mirror right off the wall.

I have no regrets about transitioning physically from male, taking HRT and having SRS, as having a male body was just plain horrible. I am happy with a female body and comfortable even with feminine pronouns... 

But when words like ""sister"" or ""woman"" or ""girl"" are used to describe me by others I don't feel good, I just get a weird detached feeling, like I am acting a role. Part of me inside screams ""I'm not a woman, I'm a Person/Human/Whatever/Blah!"" 

It feels like gender is just not an important part of my identity, my body was wrong, now it's right, the gender part was just not important... Except that now everyone assumes I am a woman, and expects me to have woman mannerisms and intonations and interests and woman identity, none of which I have. I understand that identity and interests and masculinity vs. femininity are not related but most cis folk just don't really get it.

So for the past couple of weeks, I have been trying to figure out what gender group I would class as. I rounded it down to a few groups, but today I finally came to a conclusion that's am bigendered, which has made me really happy that I can finally tell people what gender group I clasify as (I have a very open and diverse friend group).

Second thing is I have been speaking to a very dear friend of mine, and today we were speaking about corsets and cross dressing (my friend is female btw). I am going to a comic convention in October and we both have plans to dress as the opposite sex. I know she can make a very convincing boy, and from what she was saying about me, I can and will make a very convincing girl.

To explain the situation I face:
I'm an MtF transsexual, I transitioned a few years ago. My dysphoria is rooted in not being female, and has little to do with my gender. My *gender identity* is genderqueer. I don't like the gender binary or its prescriptive roles or any of that. I don't want to get boxed in by gender. To some degree, I feel like I can't identify as transgender, because I don't exactly consider myself transgender, I'm transsexual. 

However, if I try to talk about it, I can't really use gender identity to refer to my desire to be female, because its not related to my gender, its related to my desired sex. But I can't call it Sexual Identity because no one knows wtf I'm talking about then and most of the time people think I'm referring to orientation. 

Its like, the way I want my body to be is that of a cisgendered female, which is completely detached from my gender identity. However, whenever I try to express this, I seem to end up grinding my teeth in frustration because people either equate biological sex and gender and don't understand the distinction, or in the case of some trans people, who do understand the distinction, think that I'm invalidating their gender identity somehow.

I feel like I'm treating on glass within my own community out of fear of offending someone, and just want to be able to have a conversation and talk about my experiences and feeling and thoughts and fears without someone thinking I'm attacking them. Not sure what to do.

21,2013-04-11 02:15:31,1c3wwg,3,13,"20/maab here... while I've had identity issues and self-esteem problems all throughout my life, I've never really seen my gender as an issue. In the last couple years, I finally accepted my sexuality as bi, and very recently as pan. Recently, I've been exposed very strongly to the trans* community; my sister came out to me as trans shortly after I came out to the family as bi, and an old friend I've reconnected with told me she was trans as well, and we've been dating for the last couple months (which has been amazing, and she may or may not see this and know who this is). 

About a week ago, I had trouble sleeping... for some reason gender identity was simply on my mind. With my new, personal connections to the community, I brought myself up to speed in trans issues, and sex/gender concepts. At first, I found it interesting in a very scientific sense. But for some reason, I started looking inward... and I'm not really sure how I feel. Still male to a great degree? Definitely. I like being strong and athletic, doing hard labor and being a man in bed. But... I don't feel overly attached to the label. I *love* the androgynous look, and I've been messing around in the mirror... occasionally I'll catch an angle or a glimpse that looks just... awesome. I'll once in a while catch this semi-vulnerable, feminine glance... and it just feels really right.

...and this all scares the shit out of me. I've had no real issue being male... but since learning about non-binary identities... they feel right in a way. I had a couple moments today where I was sitting alone, and I felt comfortable truly identifying as genderqueer... but they lasted all of 5 mins, and every other second has been filled with questioning. In a way, I don't feel like it's legitimate questioning due to how late it is in life and how comfortable I've always been being cis. Then I have moments where the idea of being an average, cis male almost disgusts me...

I just don't even know. I sure as hell don't want any of this. I just got comfortable with my sexuality, and just started meeting and dating some wonderful people. Now this... I all at once feel frustrated that gender even matters... then scared at the idea of questioning it... then happy at following who I really want to be... then sad and angry that I can't just be ""normal"". I know I'll always have a few people there for me, no matter who I find myself being. But this is a lot to think about... and either way, I can't wait to see my gf on friday to paint my nails for the first time \^_^

I am a gender-non-conforming AFAB person. I have a feminine body and prefer mainly female and neutral clothing, while having a buzz cut and hairy pits and legs. I am not trying to look neutral; I AM neutral, so I pull from all over the spectrum and beyond and just do what makes sense to me.

34,2013-04-14 18:12:42,1cc4jg,18,24,"Hi reddit,

tl;dr version:

*Recently came to accept that I am genderqueer. I am bio-male but am currently in a female phase

*just bought my first set of women's clothes which feel amazing

*struggling with trying to leave the house because I'm too scared to leave the house in drag but I feel like I'm not myself without them.

*Don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this stuff so I thought I'd introduce myself.

I'm biologically male but throughout my life I've never quite fit in anywhere with respect to gender. I have a number of masculine traits and characteristics but also a strong set of feminine traits. They've always shifted around periodically. I've always had a hard time socially too. I (wanted) to fit in with both boys and girls. Whenever I'd play 'house' I always wanted to be the mommy. My entire life I've had much stronger friendships with girls than with guys. I often consider myself ""one of the girls.""

Throughout my life I'd have periods where I directly questioned my gender (had a brief period at 15 when I thought I might be trans) and sexuality, but sort of settled on male when I was 17. I've been pretty depressed recently so I've been spending a lot of time at home thinking. I've been feeling purposeless and unfulfilled. Like there are pieces of me that have been missing. More and more I've been giving fewer fucks about what people think of me and trusting myself more and giving myself permission to embrace my true self.

Actually, the big turn came with music. I want to be a musicologist but people throughout my entire life have discouraged me from trying to pursue music professionally. I realized that my hunger for music is so great that I could not possibly do anything else.

Maybe a week later I started to think about my gender a lot more. For the last 1-2 weeks all day every day I keep thinking things like ""I wish I were a woman"" or simply ""I am a woman."" and other things of the sort. When watching porn I started to identify more and more with the female instead of the male actors. I've had moments before and there are have plenty of times when I was more effeminate than others, but this time its different. This is the first time in my life that I've so fully shifted into a female phase.

A couple days ago I was in therapy when it finally dawned on me that I am not a man that has feminine traits, but that my deepest inner soul is androgynous and my gender expression is vast and varied. It was one of the most liberating moments of my life. It actually brought a tear to my eye as this huge weight was just lifted off my shoulders that I never even knew was there.

I went out dancing with a guy on Friday and for the first time in my life I got to dance how I wanted to. I got to dance in a way that gave me the stylistic freedom to more genuinely express myself and that made me feel sexy. I got to be a girl. When I was out on the floor I was just so... elated. It was this deep, warm happiness that felt like the pure happiness we feel as young children. Before the world has really had a chance to make an impact on us and we experience things naturally and uninhibited. It was like that, just pure ecstasy.

I hate dancing as a guy. Partly because I want to be girly and roll my hips but mostly because I'm so scared of how people will treat me. On an individual level, I don't really care what any given person thinks of me, but it's much harder to get around how people treat you. It makes me sad how scared I feel. It makes me sad that there is that much threat in the world at all. I'm scared that people will think I'm weird and gross, I'm scared that people won't understand and they'll be scared of me. Being pansexual, I have to even worry about my reputation. I constantly fight against my tendency towards femininity because if I want to sleep with a woman then I have to be the kind of person they'd be attracted to (ie. mostly likely I'd need to present as male/masculine).

So, I decided today that enough was enough and that if being a girl is what makes me happy then I should stop sitting at home and just fantasizing about it and I should go live it! I want to brag for a minute because I'm really proud of myself. I originally wanted to go with someone because I was scared of going alone and being judged. but I said to hell with it and just went by myself, got my makeup done, and bought some clothes. For days when I've thought about going I was so scared but once I made up my mind to go there was just some powerful spiritual energy carrying me through. It was just so clear that this is what I needed that nothing else mattered.

As I was getting my makeup done and I as I started trying on clothes, I would literally start jumping with glee. It just feels so right to wear these clothes. So, here's my problem. I'm depressed and I spend a lot of time at home but I can't get any work done. I tend to do better when I'm out of the house, but I don't want to leave because it means I'll have to leave myself behind. I want to wear my new clothes out but I'm scared. It's a weird tension between wanting to be seen in these clothes but also not wanting to be seen.

It just makes me so sad that I (or anyone else) should have to go through this much angst over a fundamental part of my personality that doesn't hurt anyone. It makes me sad that I feel like I have to choose between being happy and being accepted.

I have a hard time telling people. A couple people have responded positively, but even that guy (who is gay and a gender studies minor) I went out with on Friday started trying to tell me that patriarchal, heteronormative conceptions of masculinity have had such a profound impact that I'm confusing opening up sexually with being queer-gendered (is there a better word to refer to non-standard gender identities as a group?). I tried explaining it to my cousin who seemed to freak out a little and clearly didn't understand. Honestly, I don't know think I'll ever tell my parents. hey don't disapprove of being queer in general, but I don't think they'd understand what my experience is or really believe that it's not just a phase or whatever.

Anyway, this is obviously a significant time in my life and flying blind and solo so I could really use some support and guidance.

Honestly, I don\'t know think I\'ll ever tell my parents. hey don\'t disapprove of being queer in general, but I don\'t think they\'d understand what my experience is or really believe that it\'s not just a phase or whatever.\n\nAnyway, this is obviously a significant time in my life and flying blind and solo so I could really use some support and guidance.\n\n-Lily\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Finally allowing myself to be me.

I've heard some people get upset at that idea, but I think it works quite well, if we separate the words ""female"" and ""women"" and make them no longer be synonyms.

For example, if you're a trans man, you're a female man. It doesn't make you less of a man or anything like that, it just means you were born with two X chromosome and a vagina, and thus, your sex is female. A manly, manly female.

Furthermore, a male woman is a woman, a female genderqueer is genderqueer, an intersex man is a man, and so on.

Basically, the idea is: Female and Male apply to sex, not gender, for ease of communication, especially with doctors and nurses who need to check a box on a clipboard for your care, or perhaps if you're sexually interested in someone but only attracted to one sex, rather than gender, so they want to know what's going on down there before things get serious.

The obvious fact that your genitals and chromosomes aren't the business of people who have no business knowing about them is still true. I've heard a lot of people strongly disagree against this idea of female and male being words for sex rather than gender.

Over the last few years, I\'ve grown more comfortable with me, realizing that I\'m both, not that I\'m socially stunted; I felt ""normal"" for the first time, and I realized that it really doesn\'t matter because people who love me feel that way because they like me. \nSometimes I dress as a man (even though I can\'t usually pass for male thanks to my 30L breasts), sometimes I dress as a woman depending on my mood.\nFinally I told my husband (fiance at the time) that I\'m really neither and realized it doesn\'t matter; I\'m loved for who I am. He wasn\'t even surprised. \nPeople who honestly love you, will love you for you, end of story. Mom may think I\'m an odd duck but loves me regardless, and my embrace of my masculinity brought me closer to Dad. You\'d be surprised how many ""nerds"" fall into genderqueer categories; you just have to open your eyes.

66,2013-04-23 17:32:15,1cy50q,13,25,"I've been lurking here for a bit. I guess this is by way of being an intro post. Hi!

So, I don't really have a gender identity. I'm bio female, and everyone I know treats me like a female (using female pronouns, etc), and I'm fine with that. Most of the time I don't really ""feel"" like a girl though. The way I think, behave, etc has always been decidedly non-feminine. Like a tomboy phase I never grew out of.

Sometimes I like dressing up all girly, and/or wearing clothes that accentuate my female figure. It makes me feel sexy. My every-day clothes, though are fairly gender-neutral. I don't wear makeup, even when I'm being girly. 

Being bio-female, and having other people assume I'm female, doesn't bother me. I've never felt ""trapped"" in the wrong body. But if I got cursed by a witch or something and woke up a man, I'd be fine with that too. I'd probably still dress up all girly sometimes though. :) 

For a while when I was younger I thought I might be trans, because I knew I didn't feel like a girl. But then I met some trans folks who talked about how hard it was being in the wrong body. I've never felt that. And I don't really feel like I'm a boy either.

Sexually, I'm pansexual, so gender doesn't play a role in who I'm attracted to either. 

Most of the time I don't really think about it. But then I read an article or something on trans issues and I find myself dwelling on my gender identity (or lack thereof). It feels weird to be 34 years old and not really know what gender I want to be.

Anywho, just wanted to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading!

When I first came to college, I intended to figure out exactly where I fit into the gender spectrum. On one of the first days I was here, one of my new friends declared to everybody that they were genderqueer. I've been out for awhile, and just about everybody I was friends with was somehow aligned with the LGBTQ community in some way, so this didn't come across as strange. I was just filled with questions about what it was. When they explained to me exactly what that was, I quietly accepted it and began to think about myself. I had come out as gay when I was 13 but that never seemed to quite capture how I felt. I had questioned my gender heavily when I was 14 and told a friend about it. She was overwhelmingly supportive, and helped me get through some of what I now know is dysphoria. I had kind of played with the idea of telling my parents about it in hopes of maybe getting hormones to kind of delay some of puberty, but never acted on it. (By the way, I'm fairly ignorant in terms of hormones and have a few basic questions that I'll ask later.) 

Once I finally figured out what genderqueer was, I thought that I had it all figured out! All of my friends at school have been nothing but supportive, accepting my request to have gender neutral pronouns used when talking about me. They way I had thought of it, I didn't *hate* being male, I just wasn't a huge fan of it. I figured that there had already been 18 years as only being male, why not switch it up with a few female pronouns every now and then? Recently I saw the subreddit that was dedicated to timelines throughout peoples' transitions, and instantly saw how the happy the people in the after pictures were. I thought about all of those times I would break down crying when I looked in the mirror when I was a scared 14 year old and wanted to give myself a hug and explain that I wasn't broken, but that it was something that I should embrace and cherish and love. I knew after seeing the first person that had the same body type and facial structure at me transition from a handsome man to a beautiful woman and knew that I could be the one having the best time of my life.

After a random wave of dysphoria this evening, I decided that starting next year when I live off-campus in a house with my two best friends that I would spend all of my time in social situations as female. I want to inform my parents of this, and try to explain to them that I want to try hormones to possibly just block testosterone to some extent (Is that a thing?) I know that no matter what they won't be angry with me or tell me that I can't do that; I'm just worried that they won't understand, and want me to attend therapy to try to make me more male, rather than go to therapy to attempt to become the person that I want to be. 

Another anxiety that I have is transitioning in school. I attend a liberal arts school in a fairly accepting town, and I don't think I would encounter too many issues from students. I plan on transitioning for school during the second semester of next year which would *hopefully* be when I could start hormones as well. Would it be appropriate to e-mail my professors before the first day of class letting them know about a possible name and gender difference than what would be on their roster?

Seriously? That's kickass! Where could I read more about that?

Since your question involved genderqueer spiritual and shamanic practices, and there is a *lot* of ground to cover, I'll focus on just a few examples from each continent.

Start by looking up ""[two spirits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit)""... people who were formerly known as *berdaches*, but that term has since fallen out of favor because it's kind of offensive, like calling someone a prostitute. One of my favorite two spirit stories features an invading Sioux raiding party that was stopped in it's tracks by the mere presence of a single two spirit among the people they were raiding. Two spirits are considered to have a special connection with the spiritual world, allowing them to walk in many different social roles with ease, which in turn makes them very powerful shamans. 

There are several different varieties of two spirit traditions, different tribes had their own variations. The Mohave, for example, have a creation myth that features four genders: male, female, *alyha*, and *hwame*. The Lakota have the *winkte*, and the Navaho have the *nadleeh*. The Navaho actually recognize five genders, similar to the Bugis, below. (More on them in a moment!)

If you're interested in two spirits, I highly suggest these books: 

* [Two-Spirit People: Native American Gender Identity, Sexuality, and Spirituality](http://www.amazon.com/Two-Spirit-People-American-Sexuality-Spirituality/dp/0252066456/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)

* [Becoming Two-Spirit: Gay Identity and Social Acceptance in Indian Country](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Two-Spirit-Identity-Acceptance-Country/dp/0803271263/ref=pd_sim_b_5)

* [Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Ones-Fourth-Genders-America/dp/0312224796/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)

(I own the first two, I haven't finished the third.)

Even though ""Two Spirits"" are something of a Native American phenomenon, you'll find people in these social roles all around the world. Many of these traditions persist today. In Myanmar, the *acault* serve as spirit mediums. In Madagascar, the *sekrata* are considered to have significant spiritual protection. In Siberia, many Chuckchi shamans are what we would call genderqueer.

In southern Indonesia, the Bugis recognize five genders: male, female, *calabai*, *calalai*, and *bissu*. *Calabai* and *calalai* are what we would recognize as MTF or FTM transgender people, respectively. Meanwhile *bissu* exhibit all five genders as a single, harmonious unit, what we'd call genderqueer or bi gender. The advice of a *bissu* is usually sought when a Bugi has deep spiritual questions or is about to undertake a pilgrimage. 

In Bugi society, it's common practice and considered a blessing to have a *calabai* involved with the wedding preparations, and many wind up responsible for arranging the settings, the clothing, the makeup, the catering, preparing the venue, and running the reception.

[Here's the wiki article about Bugis and gender.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bissu#Bissu)

Similarly, in Kenya, the *mashoga* are biological men who assume female gender roles early in life and they are integral at wedding ceremonies. In modern times, the term *mashoga* has also become accepted as the Swahili word for ""gay.""

In the Dominican Republic, genetics has created a slew of intersex individuals, known as *[guevedoces](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~issues/articles/13.1_Kelley_E_The_Guevedoces.html)*. Their society has changed to accommodate these people, coming to accept them as a third gender entirely. [Here's another link about guevedoces, though it's NSFW.](http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-guevedoces.html ""NSFW, link provided as an anthropological resource."")

A little further south, there are the *travestis* of Brazil and Argentina, and there are also the *quariwarmi* of the area we now call Peru. While *travestis* are modern, the *quariwarmi* were genderqueer shamans of the dual-gendered Incan deity, *chuqui chinchay*. 

Perhaps the most well-known modern group would likely be the [hijra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) of India or the [kathoeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) of Thailand. To my knowledge, neither is a particularly shamanistic tradition, though there are festivals and celebrations which feature the *hijra* and the *kathoeys* very prominently.

Hello all. I thank you in advance for reading this question.

Recently I have begun to question what I truly ""am"", for it is a confusing distinction, to say the least. I suspect I may fall under some umbrella in some way, but have no idea how. Could anyone possibly help me to realise what I may be? I understand boxing one's self into a definition is not helpful, but neither I think is remaining unorganised entirely.

Anyways, here's some background info: for as long as I can remember, I have preferred to relate to maleness. When I was in kindergarten I remember asking to be called 'Michael' instead of my female name, and whenever I played 'House' or any other game of pretend, would insist on being the brother, father, or other male character.

In high school I identified as being a lesbian, as I realised my preference for female partners. However, I was raised in a strict household and required to act 'lady-like', so experimentation with appearances was right out. However, in the past few years I finally gained independence, and tried what I had wanted to try for a long time. I began to slowly dress in masculine clothing, and it felt inherently good. I cut my hair short, and that also felt good. It got to the point where I preferred to be mistaken for a young man, and would actually be upset if I was recognised as a female. When writing a story or say playing a video game, I will still always give my character a male name. I actually feel a pang of dislike towards my real female name for being so effeminate.

Within the past 8-12 months, I've begun to feel more and more 'unhappy' if you will, with the body I have. I dislike my breasts very much, and try my hardest to bind them so as to be unseen. I do not wear makeup, keep my hair short, and wear only masculine clothing. I find that at least a half dozen times a day, I see slimly-built males, or pictures of such, and wish that I had that body (I dislike the notion of being very muscular or bulgy). Sometimes I fantasize about having some facial hair, and have experimented with putting fake facial hair on to see how it looks. I have also looked heavily into top surgery and find myself longing for it.

That said, however, I do not feel the need for male genitalia, and expressly do NOT want it. On the inside, I feel like neither a male nor what society deems a female. I feel like, if I were wholly male, I would come off as a bit 'gay' (not trying to offend) simply because I have bits of effeminate mannerisms thrown into my everyday personality, enjoy being very warm and cuddly, etc. I also do not feel like I fit in with other females perfectly though, obviously.

In short, I feel like physically I'd prefer a male body, but with a more androgynous gender identity.

Thank you all so much again for even taking a look at this. Any help would be direly appreciated.

for those who don't know, I'm AMAB; trans-female.

So I've been wearing women's clothing for 2 weeks now, but I haven't been wearing a bra on campus.  This weekend I added the bra to my presentation and it was great.  Honestly, I was nervous before I did it but by the time I headed out I was totally comfortable and gave no shits.  I'm nervous about being on campus during the week so I might give myself a couple days for that... we'll see.


I've been waiting to start changing pronouns and my name until after graduation for the sake of simplicity because it's only 3 weeks away now.  Last night I was at a party with a lot of people I didn't know and few others I knew casually that I came out to.  People asked what name/pronouns I wanted to go by and my answer initially was Lily/female but after the first couple of people I just couldn't help myself and I just said fuck it and started introducing myself as Lily instead of Dleurp as Lily.  It was a great feeling.

I've never felt so comfortable or had so much fun at a party.  I'm usually totally awkward in big social situations, but this was just fantastic.  Plus, people told me I look hot so that was pretty awesome.

Of course, the one amazing, beautiful guy I met who seems open enough that he might be comfortable with dating me even though I'm early in transition is taken.  *sigh* oh well.

With every new step I take in feeling more and more like a woman I am reminded that my body is not where I want it to be and feeling sad for how much of my life I feel like I've missed out on because I've spent so long struggling with this subconciously.  But, things are getting better.  the positives far outweigh the struggles and I've been focusing on trying to just enjoy the process for what it is as a life experience.


Cool, so I just wanted to give a positive update, especially given how rough the last few days have been.  So often I feel like in forums people tend to post with problems or questions (although, /r/genderqueer is pretty good about having a good mix of positives too).

To explain the situation I face:
I'm an MtF transsexual, I transitioned a few years ago. My dysphoria is rooted in not being female, and has little to do with my gender. My *gender identity* is genderqueer. I don't like the gender binary or its prescriptive roles or any of that. I don't want to get boxed in by gender. To some degree, I feel like I can't identify as transgender, because I don't exactly consider myself transgender, I'm transsexual. 

However, if I try to talk about it, I can't really use gender identity to refer to my desire to be female, because its not related to my gender, its related to my desired sex. But I can't call it Sexual Identity because no one knows wtf I'm talking about then and most of the time people think I'm referring to orientation. 

Its like, the way I want my body to be is that of a cisgendered female, which is completely detached from my gender identity. However, whenever I try to express this, I seem to end up grinding my teeth in frustration because people either equate biological sex and gender and don't understand the distinction, or in the case of some trans people, who do understand the distinction, think that I'm invalidating their gender identity somehow.

I feel like I'm treating on glass within my own community out of fear of offending someone, and just want to be able to have a conversation and talk about my experiences and feeling and thoughts and fears without someone thinking I'm attacking them. Not sure what to do.

40,2013-04-11 02:15:31,1c3wwg,3,13,"20/maab here... while I've had identity issues and self-esteem problems all throughout my life, I've never really seen my gender as an issue. In the last couple years, I finally accepted my sexuality as bi, and very recently as pan. Recently, I've been exposed very strongly to the trans* community; my sister came out to me as trans shortly after I came out to the family as bi, and an old friend I've reconnected with told me she was trans as well, and we've been dating for the last couple months (which has been amazing, and she may or may not see this and know who this is). 

About a week ago, I had trouble sleeping... for some reason gender identity was simply on my mind. With my new, personal connections to the community, I brought myself up to speed in trans issues, and sex/gender concepts. At first, I found it interesting in a very scientific sense. But for some reason, I started looking inward... and I'm not really sure how I feel. Still male to a great degree? Definitely. I like being strong and athletic, doing hard labor and being a man in bed. But... I don't feel overly attached to the label. I *love* the androgynous look, and I've been messing around in the mirror... occasionally I'll catch an angle or a glimpse that looks just... awesome. I'll once in a while catch this semi-vulnerable, feminine glance... and it just feels really right.

...and this all scares the shit out of me. I've had no real issue being male... but since learning about non-binary identities... they feel right in a way. I had a couple moments today where I was sitting alone, and I felt comfortable truly identifying as genderqueer... but they lasted all of 5 mins, and every other second has been filled with questioning. In a way, I don't feel like it's legitimate questioning due to how late it is in life and how comfortable I've always been being cis. Then I have moments where the idea of being an average, cis male almost disgusts me...

I just don't even know. I sure as hell don't want any of this. I just got comfortable with my sexuality, and just started meeting and dating some wonderful people. Now this... I all at once feel frustrated that gender even matters... then scared at the idea of questioning it... then happy at following who I really want to be... then sad and angry that I can't just be ""normal"". I know I'll always have a few people there for me, no matter who I find myself being. But this is a lot to think about... and either way, I can't wait to see my gf on friday to paint my nails for the first time \^_^

I don't think I'm looking for advice or anything really, I just needed a good space to vent. Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)

I am a gender-non-conforming AFAB person. I have a feminine body and prefer mainly female and neutral clothing, while having a buzz cut and hairy pits and legs. I am not trying to look neutral; I AM neutral, so I pull from all over the spectrum and beyond and just do what makes sense to me.

57,2013-04-14 18:12:42,1cc4jg,18,24,"Hi reddit,

tl;dr version:

*Recently came to accept that I am genderqueer. I am bio-male but am currently in a female phase

*just bought my first set of women's clothes which feel amazing

*struggling with trying to leave the house because I'm too scared to leave the house in drag but I feel like I'm not myself without them.

*Don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this stuff so I thought I'd introduce myself.

I'm biologically male but throughout my life I've never quite fit in anywhere with respect to gender. I have a number of masculine traits and characteristics but also a strong set of feminine traits. They've always shifted around periodically. I've always had a hard time socially too. I (wanted) to fit in with both boys and girls. Whenever I'd play 'house' I always wanted to be the mommy. My entire life I've had much stronger friendships with girls than with guys. I often consider myself ""one of the girls.""

Throughout my life I'd have periods where I directly questioned my gender (had a brief period at 15 when I thought I might be trans) and sexuality, but sort of settled on male when I was 17. I've been pretty depressed recently so I've been spending a lot of time at home thinking. I've been feeling purposeless and unfulfilled. Like there are pieces of me that have been missing. More and more I've been giving fewer fucks about what people think of me and trusting myself more and giving myself permission to embrace my true self.

Actually, the big turn came with music. I want to be a musicologist but people throughout my entire life have discouraged me from trying to pursue music professionally. I realized that my hunger for music is so great that I could not possibly do anything else.

Maybe a week later I started to think about my gender a lot more. For the last 1-2 weeks all day every day I keep thinking things like ""I wish I were a woman"" or simply ""I am a woman."" and other things of the sort. When watching porn I started to identify more and more with the female instead of the male actors. I've had moments before and there are have plenty of times when I was more effeminate than others, but this time its different. This is the first time in my life that I've so fully shifted into a female phase.

A couple days ago I was in therapy when it finally dawned on me that I am not a man that has feminine traits, but that my deepest inner soul is androgynous and my gender expression is vast and varied. It was one of the most liberating moments of my life. It actually brought a tear to my eye as this huge weight was just lifted off my shoulders that I never even knew was there.

I went out dancing with a guy on Friday and for the first time in my life I got to dance how I wanted to. I got to dance in a way that gave me the stylistic freedom to more genuinely express myself and that made me feel sexy. I got to be a girl. When I was out on the floor I was just so... elated. It was this deep, warm happiness that felt like the pure happiness we feel as young children. Before the world has really had a chance to make an impact on us and we experience things naturally and uninhibited. It was like that, just pure ecstasy.

I hate dancing as a guy. Partly because I want to be girly and roll my hips but mostly because I'm so scared of how people will treat me. On an individual level, I don't really care what any given person thinks of me, but it's much harder to get around how people treat you. It makes me sad how scared I feel. It makes me sad that there is that much threat in the world at all. I'm scared that people will think I'm weird and gross, I'm scared that people won't understand and they'll be scared of me. Being pansexual, I have to even worry about my reputation. I constantly fight against my tendency towards femininity because if I want to sleep with a woman then I have to be the kind of person they'd be attracted to (ie. mostly likely I'd need to present as male/masculine).

So, I decided today that enough was enough and that if being a girl is what makes me happy then I should stop sitting at home and just fantasizing about it and I should go live it! I want to brag for a minute because I'm really proud of myself. I originally wanted to go with someone because I was scared of going alone and being judged. but I said to hell with it and just went by myself, got my makeup done, and bought some clothes. For days when I've thought about going I was so scared but once I made up my mind to go there was just some powerful spiritual energy carrying me through. It was just so clear that this is what I needed that nothing else mattered.

As I was getting my makeup done and I as I started trying on clothes, I would literally start jumping with glee. It just feels so right to wear these clothes. So, here's my problem. I'm depressed and I spend a lot of time at home but I can't get any work done. I tend to do better when I'm out of the house, but I don't want to leave because it means I'll have to leave myself behind. I want to wear my new clothes out but I'm scared. It's a weird tension between wanting to be seen in these clothes but also not wanting to be seen.

It just makes me so sad that I (or anyone else) should have to go through this much angst over a fundamental part of my personality that doesn't hurt anyone. It makes me sad that I feel like I have to choose between being happy and being accepted.

I have a hard time telling people. A couple people have responded positively, but even that guy (who is gay and a gender studies minor) I went out with on Friday started trying to tell me that patriarchal, heteronormative conceptions of masculinity have had such a profound impact that I'm confusing opening up sexually with being queer-gendered (is there a better word to refer to non-standard gender identities as a group?). I tried explaining it to my cousin who seemed to freak out a little and clearly didn't understand. Honestly, I don't know think I'll ever tell my parents. hey don't disapprove of being queer in general, but I don't think they'd understand what my experience is or really believe that it's not just a phase or whatever.

Anyway, this is obviously a significant time in my life and flying blind and solo so I could really use some support and guidance.

For days when I\'ve thought about going I was so scared but once I made up my mind to go there was just some powerful spiritual energy carrying me through. It was just so clear that this is what I needed that nothing else mattered.\n\nAs I was getting my makeup done and I as I started trying on clothes, I would literally start jumping with glee. It just feels so right to wear these clothes. So, here\'s my problem. I\'m depressed and I spend a lot of time at home but I can\'t get any work done. I tend to do better when I\'m out of the house, but I don\'t want to leave because it means I\'ll have to leave myself behind. I want to wear my new clothes out but I\'m scared. It\'s a weird tension between wanting to be seen in these clothes but also not wanting to be seen.\n\nIt just makes me so sad that I (or anyone else) should have to go through this much angst over a fundamental part of my personality that doesn\'t hurt anyone. It makes me sad that I feel like I have to choose between being happy and being accepted.\n\nI have a hard time telling people. A couple people have responded positively, but even that guy (who is gay and a gender studies minor) I went out with on Friday started trying to tell me that patriarchal, heteronormative conceptions of masculinity have had such a profound impact that I\'m confusing opening up sexually with being queer-gendered (is there a better word to refer to non-standard gender identities as a group?). I tried explaining it to my cousin who seemed to freak out a little and clearly didn\'t understand. Honestly, I don\'t know think I\'ll ever tell my parents. hey don\'t disapprove of being queer in general, but I don\'t think they\'d understand what my experience is or really believe that it\'s not just a phase or whatever.\n\nAnyway, this is obviously a significant time in my life and flying blind and solo so I could really use some support and guidance.\n\n-Lily\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Finally allowing myself to be me.

I've heard some people get upset at that idea, but I think it works quite well, if we separate the words ""female"" and ""women"" and make them no longer be synonyms.

For example, if you're a trans man, you're a female man. It doesn't make you less of a man or anything like that, it just means you were born with two X chromosome and a vagina, and thus, your sex is female. A manly, manly female.

Furthermore, a male woman is a woman, a female genderqueer is genderqueer, an intersex man is a man, and so on.

Basically, the idea is: Female and Male apply to sex, not gender, for ease of communication, especially with doctors and nurses who need to check a box on a clipboard for your care, or perhaps if you're sexually interested in someone but only attracted to one sex, rather than gender, so they want to know what's going on down there before things get serious.

The obvious fact that your genitals and chromosomes aren't the business of people who have no business knowing about them is still true. I've heard a lot of people strongly disagree against this idea of female and male being words for sex rather than gender.

I was the oldest or one of the oldest born on both sides and was never really forced into gender stereotypes as such. Everyone in my family seemed okay with giving me both of what is considered classic boy and girl toys, and my paternal grandmother made an effort of always giving me one of each because I always wanted some of each.

I know that if I felt I needed to sit my father down and express how I feel he would not be surprised. He has always talked about me as a boy and a girl in one... although his conservative turn of phrase is ""I have always said you were a third gender"".

I have often been torn between female and male... feeling like I should fit into one and I cannot fit into either. I have become comfortable enough with my female anatomy... but generally feel like a mix, sometimes more female and sometimes more male. 

I suppose the general expression that I really felt hit home was gender queer... and that was nice to see there are more people out there who feel like similar things.

So, I don't really have a gender identity. I'm bio female, and everyone I know treats me like a female (using female pronouns, etc), and I'm fine with that. Most of the time I don't really ""feel"" like a girl though. The way I think, behave, etc has always been decidedly non-feminine. Like a tomboy phase I never grew out of.

Sometimes I like dressing up all girly, and/or wearing clothes that accentuate my female figure. It makes me feel sexy. My every-day clothes, though are fairly gender-neutral. I don't wear makeup, even when I'm being girly. 

Being bio-female, and having other people assume I'm female, doesn't bother me. I've never felt ""trapped"" in the wrong body. But if I got cursed by a witch or something and woke up a man, I'd be fine with that too. I'd probably still dress up all girly sometimes though. :) 

For a while when I was younger I thought I might be trans, because I knew I didn't feel like a girl. But then I met some trans folks who talked about how hard it was being in the wrong body. I've never felt that. And I don't really feel like I'm a boy either.

Sexually, I'm pansexual, so gender doesn't play a role in who I'm attracted to either. 

Most of the time I don't really think about it. But then I read an article or something on trans issues and I find myself dwelling on my gender identity (or lack thereof). It feels weird to be 34 years old and not really know what gender I want to be.

When I first came to college, I intended to figure out exactly where I fit into the gender spectrum. On one of the first days I was here, one of my new friends declared to everybody that they were genderqueer. I've been out for awhile, and just about everybody I was friends with was somehow aligned with the LGBTQ community in some way, so this didn't come across as strange. I was just filled with questions about what it was. When they explained to me exactly what that was, I quietly accepted it and began to think about myself. I had come out as gay when I was 13 but that never seemed to quite capture how I felt. I had questioned my gender heavily when I was 14 and told a friend about it. She was overwhelmingly supportive, and helped me get through some of what I now know is dysphoria. I had kind of played with the idea of telling my parents about it in hopes of maybe getting hormones to kind of delay some of puberty, but never acted on it. (By the way, I'm fairly ignorant in terms of hormones and have a few basic questions that I'll ask later.) 

Once I finally figured out what genderqueer was, I thought that I had it all figured out! All of my friends at school have been nothing but supportive, accepting my request to have gender neutral pronouns used when talking about me. They way I had thought of it, I didn't *hate* being male, I just wasn't a huge fan of it. I figured that there had already been 18 years as only being male, why not switch it up with a few female pronouns every now and then? Recently I saw the subreddit that was dedicated to timelines throughout peoples' transitions, and instantly saw how the happy the people in the after pictures were. I thought about all of those times I would break down crying when I looked in the mirror when I was a scared 14 year old and wanted to give myself a hug and explain that I wasn't broken, but that it was something that I should embrace and cherish and love. I knew after seeing the first person that had the same body type and facial structure at me transition from a handsome man to a beautiful woman and knew that I could be the one having the best time of my life.

After a random wave of dysphoria this evening, I decided that starting next year when I live off-campus in a house with my two best friends that I would spend all of my time in social situations as female. I want to inform my parents of this, and try to explain to them that I want to try hormones to possibly just block testosterone to some extent (Is that a thing?) I know that no matter what they won't be angry with me or tell me that I can't do that; I'm just worried that they won't understand, and want me to attend therapy to try to make me more male, rather than go to therapy to attempt to become the person that I want to be. 

Another anxiety that I have is transitioning in school. I attend a liberal arts school in a fairly accepting town, and I don't think I would encounter too many issues from students. I plan on transitioning for school during the second semester of next year which would *hopefully* be when I could start hormones as well. Would it be appropriate to e-mail my professors before the first day of class letting them know about a possible name and gender difference than what would be on their roster?

Here is the exchange in it's entirety. I didn't really get the chance to go into the kind of depth I would have preferred, but I think I answered the user's question. First, the question, quoting a comment which I'm pretty sure I'd left on /r/AskHistorians:

&gt; ""This is kind of funny because in ancient cultures, genderqueer people were valued precisely because they could bridge the gap between male and female and act as mediators between both groups.""
Seriously? That's kickass! Where could I read more about that?

Since your question involved genderqueer spiritual and shamanic practices, and there is a *lot* of ground to cover, I'll focus on just a few examples from each continent.

Start by looking up ""[two spirits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit)""... people who were formerly known as *berdaches*, but that term has since fallen out of favor because it's kind of offensive, like calling someone a prostitute. One of my favorite two spirit stories features an invading Sioux raiding party that was stopped in it's tracks by the mere presence of a single two spirit among the people they were raiding. Two spirits are considered to have a special connection with the spiritual world, allowing them to walk in many different social roles with ease, which in turn makes them very powerful shamans. 

There are several different varieties of two spirit traditions, different tribes had their own variations. The Mohave, for example, have a creation myth that features four genders: male, female, *alyha*, and *hwame*. The Lakota have the *winkte*, and the Navaho have the *nadleeh*. The Navaho actually recognize five genders, similar to the Bugis, below. (More on them in a moment!)

If you're interested in two spirits, I highly suggest these books: 

* [Two-Spirit People: Native American Gender Identity, Sexuality, and Spirituality](http://www.amazon.com/Two-Spirit-People-American-Sexuality-Spirituality/dp/0252066456/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)

* [Becoming Two-Spirit: Gay Identity and Social Acceptance in Indian Country](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Two-Spirit-Identity-Acceptance-Country/dp/0803271263/ref=pd_sim_b_5)

* [Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Ones-Fourth-Genders-America/dp/0312224796/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)

(I own the first two, I haven't finished the third.)

Even though ""Two Spirits"" are something of a Native American phenomenon, you'll find people in these social roles all around the world. Many of these traditions persist today. In Myanmar, the *acault* serve as spirit mediums. In Madagascar, the *sekrata* are considered to have significant spiritual protection. In Siberia, many Chuckchi shamans are what we would call genderqueer.

In southern Indonesia, the Bugis recognize five genders: male, female, *calabai*, *calalai*, and *bissu*. *Calabai* and *calalai* are what we would recognize as MTF or FTM transgender people, respectively. Meanwhile *bissu* exhibit all five genders as a single, harmonious unit, what we'd call genderqueer or bi gender. The advice of a *bissu* is usually sought when a Bugi has deep spiritual questions or is about to undertake a pilgrimage. 

In Bugi society, it's common practice and considered a blessing to have a *calabai* involved with the wedding preparations, and many wind up responsible for arranging the settings, the clothing, the makeup, the catering, preparing the venue, and running the reception.

[Here's the wiki article about Bugis and gender.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bissu#Bissu)

Similarly, in Kenya, the *mashoga* are biological men who assume female gender roles early in life and they are integral at wedding ceremonies. In modern times, the term *mashoga* has also become accepted as the Swahili word for ""gay.""

In the Dominican Republic, genetics has created a slew of intersex individuals, known as *[guevedoces](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~issues/articles/13.1_Kelley_E_The_Guevedoces.html)*. Their society has changed to accommodate these people, coming to accept them as a third gender entirely. [Here's another link about guevedoces, though it's NSFW.](http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-guevedoces.html ""NSFW, link provided as an anthropological resource."")

A little further south, there are the *travestis* of Brazil and Argentina, and there are also the *quariwarmi* of the area we now call Peru. While *travestis* are modern, the *quariwarmi* were genderqueer shamans of the dual-gendered Incan deity, *chuqui chinchay*. 

Perhaps the most well-known modern group would likely be the [hijra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) of India or the [kathoeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) of Thailand. To my knowledge, neither is a particularly shamanistic tradition, though there are festivals and celebrations which feature the *hijra* and the *kathoeys* very prominently.

(More on them in a moment!)\n\nIf you\'re interested in two spirits, I highly suggest these books: \n\n* [Two-Spirit People: Native American Gender Identity, Sexuality, and Spirituality](http://www.amazon.com/Two-Spirit-People-American-Sexuality-Spirituality/dp/0252066456/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)\n\n* [Becoming Two-Spirit: Gay Identity and Social Acceptance in Indian Country](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Two-Spirit-Identity-Acceptance-Country/dp/0803271263/ref=pd_sim_b_5)\n\n* [Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Ones-Fourth-Genders-America/dp/0312224796/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)\n\n(I own the first two, I haven\'t finished the third.)\n\nEven though ""Two Spirits"" are something of a Native American phenomenon, you\'ll find people in these social roles all around the world. Many of these traditions persist today. In Myanmar, the *acault* serve as spirit mediums. In Madagascar, the *sekrata* are considered to have significant spiritual protection. In Siberia, many Chuckchi shamans are what we would call genderqueer.\n\nIn southern Indonesia, the Bugis recognize five genders: male, female, *calabai*, *calalai*, and *bissu*. *Calabai* and *calalai* are what we would recognize as MTF or FTM transgender people, respectively. Meanwhile *bissu* exhibit all five genders as a single, harmonious unit, what we\'d call genderqueer or bi gender. The advice of a *bissu* is usually sought when a Bugi has deep spiritual questions or is about to undertake a pilgrimage. \n\nIn Bugi society, it\'s common practice and considered a blessing to have a *calabai* involved with the wedding preparations, and many wind up responsible for arranging the settings, the clothing, the makeup, the catering, preparing the venue, and running the reception.\n\n[Here\'s the wiki article about Bugis and gender.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bissu#Bissu)\n\nSimilarly, in Kenya, the *mashoga* are biological men who assume female gender roles early in life and they are integral at wedding ceremonies. In modern times, the term *mashoga* has also become accepted as the Swahili word for ""gay.""\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, genetics has created a slew of intersex individuals, known as *[guevedoces](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~issues/articles/13.1_Kelley_E_The_Guevedoces.html)*. Their society has changed to accommodate these people, coming to accept them as a third gender entirely. [Here\'s another link about guevedoces, though it\'s NSFW.](http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-guevedoces.html ""NSFW, link provided as an anthropological resource."")\n\nA little further south, there are the *travestis* of Brazil and Argentina, and there are also the *quariwarmi* of the area we now call Peru. While *travestis* are modern, the *quariwarmi* were genderqueer shamans of the dual-gendered Incan deity, *chuqui chinchay*. \n\nPerhaps the most well-known modern group would likely be the [hijra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) of India or the [kathoeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) of Thailand. To my knowledge, neither is a particularly shamanistic tradition, though there are festivals and celebrations which feature the *hijra* and the *kathoeys* very prominently.\n\nI keep a link to [this worldwide map](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/two-spirits/map.html) on the sidebar at /r/genderqueer, and it may interest you.

Hello all. I thank you in advance for reading this question.

Recently I have begun to question what I truly ""am"", for it is a confusing distinction, to say the least. I suspect I may fall under some umbrella in some way, but have no idea how. Could anyone possibly help me to realise what I may be? I understand boxing one's self into a definition is not helpful, but neither I think is remaining unorganised entirely.

Anyways, here's some background info: for as long as I can remember, I have preferred to relate to maleness. When I was in kindergarten I remember asking to be called 'Michael' instead of my female name, and whenever I played 'House' or any other game of pretend, would insist on being the brother, father, or other male character.

In high school I identified as being a lesbian, as I realised my preference for female partners. However, I was raised in a strict household and required to act 'lady-like', so experimentation with appearances was right out. However, in the past few years I finally gained independence, and tried what I had wanted to try for a long time. I began to slowly dress in masculine clothing, and it felt inherently good. I cut my hair short, and that also felt good. It got to the point where I preferred to be mistaken for a young man, and would actually be upset if I was recognised as a female. When writing a story or say playing a video game, I will still always give my character a male name. I actually feel a pang of dislike towards my real female name for being so effeminate.

Within the past 8-12 months, I've begun to feel more and more 'unhappy' if you will, with the body I have. I dislike my breasts very much, and try my hardest to bind them so as to be unseen. I do not wear makeup, keep my hair short, and wear only masculine clothing. I find that at least a half dozen times a day, I see slimly-built males, or pictures of such, and wish that I had that body (I dislike the notion of being very muscular or bulgy). Sometimes I fantasize about having some facial hair, and have experimented with putting fake facial hair on to see how it looks. I have also looked heavily into top surgery and find myself longing for it.

That said, however, I do not feel the need for male genitalia, and expressly do NOT want it. On the inside, I feel like neither a male nor what society deems a female. I feel like, if I were wholly male, I would come off as a bit 'gay' (not trying to offend) simply because I have bits of effeminate mannerisms thrown into my everyday personality, enjoy being very warm and cuddly, etc. I also do not feel like I fit in with other females perfectly though, obviously.

In short, I feel like physically I'd prefer a male body, but with a more androgynous gender identity.

Thank you all so much again for even taking a look at this. Any help would be direly appreciated.

for those who don't know, I'm AMAB; trans-female.

So I've been wearing women's clothing for 2 weeks now, but I haven't been wearing a bra on campus.  This weekend I added the bra to my presentation and it was great.  Honestly, I was nervous before I did it but by the time I headed out I was totally comfortable and gave no shits.  I'm nervous about being on campus during the week so I might give myself a couple days for that... we'll see.


I've been waiting to start changing pronouns and my name until after graduation for the sake of simplicity because it's only 3 weeks away now.  Last night I was at a party with a lot of people I didn't know and few others I knew casually that I came out to.  People asked what name/pronouns I wanted to go by and my answer initially was Lily/female but after the first couple of people I just couldn't help myself and I just said fuck it and started introducing myself as Lily instead of Dleurp as Lily.  It was a great feeling.

I've never felt so comfortable or had so much fun at a party.  I'm usually totally awkward in big social situations, but this was just fantastic.  Plus, people told me I look hot so that was pretty awesome.

Of course, the one amazing, beautiful guy I met who seems open enough that he might be comfortable with dating me even though I'm early in transition is taken.  *sigh* oh well.

With every new step I take in feeling more and more like a woman I am reminded that my body is not where I want it to be and feeling sad for how much of my life I feel like I've missed out on because I've spent so long struggling with this subconciously.  But, things are getting better.  the positives far outweigh the struggles and I've been focusing on trying to just enjoy the process for what it is as a life experience.


Cool, so I just wanted to give a positive update, especially given how rough the last few days have been.  So often I feel like in forums people tend to post with problems or questions (although, /r/genderqueer is pretty good about having a good mix of positives too).

But, things are getting better.  the positives far outweigh the struggles and I've been focusing on trying to just enjoy the process for what it is as a life experience.\n\n\nCool, so I just wanted to give a positive update, especially given how rough the last few days have been.  So often I feel like in forums people tend to post with problems or questions (although, /r/genderqueer is pretty good about having a good mix of positives too).  \n"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'The princess snuck out of the tower, even if only for a few hours.', 'created': 1367199203.0}",84.0

I am scared of losing my sex drive, especially as my fantasies are very masculine in nature; in fact, because they are so masculine, I feel like I am genderfluid sometimes. But I never want to present male in public.

I also feel guilty for my fantasies sometimes;

* I am into BDSM, and love being able to penetrate. I know I could use a strapon, but I have no idea if that would have the same effect for me, let alone someone who would accept it as an alternative; let alone any lesbian who would be willing to accept a transwoman :/ (This is because I am homoflexible, and do not like standard bodies of men. I don't know if this is because it just reminds me of my own body.) 

* I am into DaddyDom / Ageplay, and I am into rape play. (I realize this can look very bad, but I do not want to do anything with anyone except adults and 100% consensual.)

I want to just start HRT but I know that its something that I can't exactly reverse. Any advise would be helpful!

TL,DR: I am a pre-everything transwoman scared of losing sexual desires/fantasies, or worse yet, keeping them when I can never again act them out. Is this irrational?

After many years of questioning, confusion, feeling around, and pondering, I've come to terms with the fact that I am male and my body is female.  

But I now have many questions. I'm already seeing a therapist and I will be going to a support group on Wednesdays. 

A little background: I'm 24, bisexual, married then divorced, currently in a relationship with a cisgendered man that knows the situation and is working out his own feelings on it--he and his family have also been very supportive, but he wants a wife, not a husband. We are in a fairly committed relationship (LDR, 3 years). I'm in college, graduating in the fall. I have a cat and a dog (unrelated). 

The feelings are hard to talk about, but I'm starting to be able to voice them. It's very difficult to express my thoughts in a way that's coherent to those that might not understand what it's like. Right now everything feels rocky. I'm not depressed but I am very disquieted. I don't know what my future as an individual will look like. I don't know how far I want to transition. 

I know I'm not alone. I'm not suicidal or depressed. 

The only things I have done so far are: my hair is now short and I slap some product on it in the morning, I dress in more gender neutral clothing. I have resolved to purchase a binder, though I have no idea from where, how, or how much. I will also be seeing a specialist in the near future to get my hormones and self tested to see just where on the physical spectrum I fall. 

Though the support group will likely help answer these questions, I want to try to talk to as many people as I can  and get different perspectives.

""Dear HRC,
I am writing today because of two recent events. The first event that I became aware of was the ""Stand for Marriage"" event, which I whole heartedly support. However, the second event that caught my attention was the numerous articles that I read shortly there after about member(s) of the HRC asking a Transgendered person to remove a Trans Flag at the event in Our Nations Capitol on the steps of the United States Supreme Court. I was truly shocked and appalled. I couldn't believe that an organization that states ""Working for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Equal Rights"" didn't seem to care about Transgendered rights during that event. I have heard that the HRC has issued an apology, but I just do not understand why the request to remove the flag by other members, who I would presume are there to fight for rights OF ALL, ever happened in the first place. I have heard of great acts of the HRC and not a day goes by that I do not see a HRC decal on the back of a vehicle, however, I find myself questioning why I would support a organization with a donation who, as it seems, does not really care about Transgendered people when it is at a national event like the one held in DC. If that kind of action happens in the spot light, I can only wonder what is being said in the shadows.
