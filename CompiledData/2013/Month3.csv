I'm a (MtF) trans, taking hormones for about 9 months now. About a month ago, I was raped by one of my closest friends who knew me before I started my transition and I'm so scared to do anything about it. 
It was the weekend before I turned eighteen, so a group of my friends took me out for dinner. Afterwards, we all split up and walked home and I was alone with **him**, when he asked if I wanted to stay at his house and call for a ride home. It started hailing really bad, and since his house was closer, I agreed.
When we got to his house, we were both soaking wet and freezing, so instead of calling my parents straight away, I took a few minutes to warm myself upstairs. I got ready to take out my phone, when he, completely naked, comes through the door, grabs my arm and throws my bag aside. I was so shocked that I didn't realize that he was pulling me into his bedroom until it was too late.
He ordered me to strip or he'll hurt me. I initially refused, thinking that this was just a really bad joke, until he punched and kicked me so hard I thought my bones would break. I took off everything except for my bra and undies, and he grabbed my arm again and pushed me onto the bed. Yelling at him, he forcibly removed the rest of my clothing despite my protests, and when I got fully undressed, I realized what a vulnerable position I let myself be in.
I begged him to just let me go, but he responded with things like *""You had this coming,""* and *""You should be happy you're getting laid at all.""* I asked him if he would really do this to a friend. He answered, *""You didn't have to be this girly.""* 
His grip on my arm was really hurting me at that point, and I just wanted to avoid angering him, so I stopped protesting, and what he did next is not something I can bring myself to tell in detail right now. It was incredibly painful, like I was getting crushed and ripped apart at the same time. I was both humiliated and in agony... so much that I wished to die right then, and right now I think I still wish for that.
He abused me for hours until he stopped and went to bed. I cried silently to myself until I could hear his snores. Too afraid to call anyone, I sneaked out early in the morning and ran home in the cold. My parents must have thought I was over at a friend's, so they didn't bother texting me. Afterwards, I kept everything that happened to myself. 
He later said he was sorry over a text, and wanted to continue being my friend if we could forget the whole thing. I told him to leave me alone, but he continues to message me about the incident, saying *""You didn't even hate it since you didn't pass out like real rape victims.""* I've been avoiding him ever since but I can only pretend it didn't happen for so long.

Sorry for that huge read but I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do... I'll feel guilty if I'm responsible for throwing him in jail by pressing charges, and I don't want my other friends finding out that I got raped, or anyone knowing that I'm trans. I'm terrified of him and frightened that he might attack me again. I feel like he could pop out of anywhere behind me and drag me back to his home. I'm scared of revealing this to my boyfriend, because I don't want him to see me in such a pitiful state. I just don't know what to do anymore and I absolutely want nobody to find out about this... I'm afraid of posting here even on a new account in case anybody I know browses /r/trans but I feel like if I don't tell someone soon, I might just do the wrong thing and it can't be fixed.

My big issue is figuring out what the best practices are for this. The AP stylebook says that transsexuals are people who change genders via surgery. It says to use the preferred pronoun for transgenders when they acquire the physical characteristics of the opposite sex or if they present themselves in such a way that doesn't correspond with ""their sex at birth.""

I know that's not very complete and doesn't answer a lot of my questions, but there's not really a set standard on this, and I'd like to know the best way to write about trans* people.

If Harry became Harriet, do I write about the person's past as Harry using he/him/his? Or do I still use the preferred pronoun of today's Harriet?

I am planning to run the Marine Corps Marathon for the Human Rights Campaign, but need to get to $1500 in donations as soon as possible to be one of the 50 people who gets to run for them.

My spouse is transgender, so I'm doing it for her. I first found out about it several years ago when we were still dating (we've been dating since high school actually, and now are almost 30). At first I was shocked and didn't know what to do, but my partner introduced me to Jennifer Finney Boylan's memoir and a couple other books that resonated with me at the time. We talked it out then and we're still together now. 

I think it's incredibly brave and amazing that you guys come out and then make it through the transition process. I'm running to support your right to transition, your right for respect, your right for health care coverage and education, your right for marriage and choice. 

This is an issue that has become important to me in the last several years, though I've always been a supporter of LGBT issues in general. I'm just always shocked by how the 'T' tends to get ignored or discriminated against by the rest of the 'LGB'. 

Anyway... I'm rambling now. The point is, I was hoping you guys could consider either making a donation or passing on this missive to others who might be interested in donating to the cause. I would really appreciate even just a dollar. Anything. I want to run for the HRC.

Hi. I'm Al.

So! I identify as androgynous, though I'll go through periods of fluidity. I don't really care, though it seems that all of my boyish or gender neutral clothing is always dirty whenever I am feeling more manly, because Murphy's Law. I've never really found my neutral tendencies to be bothersome, though I have to admit there are times when I am acutely aware of not being female (which is my sex).

I took a gender neutral name, have a nice gender neutral online persona, have a gender neutral pseudonym for my writing...

Have breasts the size of cantaloupes... 

And therein lies my discomfort. I can look on a mirror and be perfectly happy... As long as I don't look below my shoulders. Tried a binder once, borrowed from a trans friend of mine. Did wonders for him, just gave me torpedo uniboob. I've since lost some weight, and thank gods I've lost some there, too... Not a lot, but enough that I notice. Thought about trying a binder again, but I'm too poor to buy one right now. Not sure I'm prepared to drop the cash on it with such a risk of failure is at hand... But I really, really hate my breasts. Always have.

Hnn...

The other bane of my existence is that no one seems to get it. I have a penchant for cute things... Also, as an artist, I am very keen on aesthetics. For some reason these things are associated with femininity, and thus have been used as evidence against me and my gender identity. ""You like X-girlie thing, so you're a woman."" What about the X-boy things I like, or the gender neuter things? Or the fact that my likes and dislikes don't actually dictate my gender identity? I have a hard time trying to explain it to people...

14,2013-03-05 00:28:23,19o8t2,8,11,"Hello! My name is Jake. I have a few questions for all of you beautiful people! 

I see a lot of speech through out about identities and such. From what I know, there are those that associate as males, there are those that associate as females, and there are people who are gender-fluid, which tend to switch between the two. Is that correct? What do you refer to somebody who doesn't really care for or feel like they have a gender? For example, I am biologically male, but I don't really feel like a guy, nor do I really feel like a girl. I just feel like myself, to give a poor explanation. A person without a sexuality is referred to as asexual; is a person without an associated gender agender? Does it work like that?

I've started to dress a bit more femininely. To continue on the aforementioned explanation, I'm not trying to dress feminine because I feel feminine, but just because I like some dresses and some typically female clothing. Are there any good places that sell either androgynous clothes or female clothes that still fit a male (For example, I do not have breasts). [Here's an example of my body type plus the first dress I just bought!](http://imgur.com/a/C9SJW)

As I've started wearing dresses, I figure that it's good to shave my legs (plus they feel pretty nice now), but it's a bit difficult. How do you people get the upper-back of your legs, if you do shave? In addition, how  often do you shave your legs? My legs still feel like they're a bit stubbly, even after shaving with a three-blade women's razor. How could I get a closer shave? With my underarms, it's even harder to get a close shave.

I've told my parents that I'm going to be dressing a bit differently and they are fine with that, so I'm starting to dress around the house to get comfortable with my new clothes. Is there anything I should know before wearing these new clothes in public (I am a senior in high school and a student of a college)? I expect to get some odd stares at first, but that's not a big issue!

15,2013-03-05 17:06:53,19prfq,9,44,"Male here, married, kids.  I'd been running into this gray rut of apathy and depression for years, gradually, like a frog being boiled to death in water that gets hot too slow for him to notice.  A negative voice was my constant mental companion, whispering to me that I'd made wrong choices, that nobody would care if I died, even helpfully conjuring dark scenarios to 'help' me figure out how to dramatically end everything, either alone or even with lots of company.  Not to be too maudlin about it, but I was too miserably apathetic to even consider getting help, the idea that things could get better seemed childishly ridiculous.

I was getting dressed two days ago and I sat there holding my clothes, looking at a pair of my wife's underwear that was sticking out of a drawer.  I still don't know where it came from, this impulse to put them on.  All I know is that the moment they slid up my hips it felt like my skull...loosened.  Like a squeeze of pressure that had been there so long it was considered normal was gone.

I felt...better.  For the first time in what might be a decade I felt like things were going to be OK, in a life where before I hadn't ever even thought of that as an option.  I didn't know why or how things were going to be OK, it just seemed like everything being OK was as normal as the sun coming up in the morning.

I let the feeling push me along that afternoon.  It just didn't seem right to be wearing ""such pretty panties"" (they were actually more underwear than panties, I'm not sure of the difference but the cheery melody in my head happily didn't care) while still having so much body hair on my legs and arms, so I shaved everywhere I could reach, getting it smooth and nice as best I could.  I was clumsy about it in some places, one leg has some cuts that still sting a bit, but I was even cheerful about that.  I tried on the contact lenses that my wife had pushed me to try months and months ago, and the inconvenience of putting them in that had so annoyed me - I'd only worn them for a couple of days at first - seemed silly, they made me look good and I could see my eyes.  I put my black metal hard-edged glasses away, hoping I wouldn't have to wear them much again.

My wife noticed her underwear sticking out of my clothes a little bit that evening when I was leaning over to load the washing machine, and she laughed harder than I'd heard her laugh in years.  The kids wondered what was going on, we told them a story about me making a face that just caught her off guard.  Later she had some questions, I told her that I was in a silly mood...she accepted it, but was wondering if I was OK - and she was a little put off at me taking her things without asking.

Yesterday was a Monday.  A dark, grey-skied wintry Monday, at a job that had been grinding me down.  I walked to work wearing a pair of satiny women's underwear under my regular clothing, my sharp-edged glasses sitting at home, and everything was beautiful.  The slippery sidewalks were like a game, the wintry breeze was invigorating, the black birds against the white snow were poetic...I laughed out loud at nothing in particular while walking to work...and that nagging, whispering negative voice, for the first time since I could remember, was completely silent.

All through the day and into the evening I was cheerful.  The computer games and endless Internet scanning that I'd been numbingly retreating into for years didn't attract my interest - I cleaned things up instead, did what I could to make my house as pretty and cheerful as I felt inside.  I participated in the evening meal's conversation, I watched tv while actually chatting with family members - and none of it was pretend or forced, it all just felt right.

That night, when we were alone, I told my wife about how I'd felt happy all day, and I told her about the existence of the negative voice and how it had gone suddenly, wonderfully silent.  She was happy for me, happy I'd shared it with her, felt sad for me that I'd been facing it so long.  We laughed together about it, I can love how this experiment is affecting me and still know feel that there's a silliness to it.  She's worried about what I'm going through, and still doesn't quite know how to process her man wearing her underwear.

I'm in my second full day in women's underwear.  The happiness is still bubbling along inside, and I hope it's come to stay for a while.  I find myself taking stairs instead of elevators as my job takes me from building to building and office to office, because I want my body - not ""this body"", but ""my body"" - to feel healthier and look better.  I look at myself in the mirror and smile...and a different voice, not a whisper but full of life, told me that people love me, that what I do is important, and that I'm worth caring about.

The new voice is a funny mix of encouragement to make things better and happiness with how I am.  I don't have to change, but I would love it if I did...if I got healthier, maybe got rid of the grey hair that was creeping in...it isn't because I have to, or because of how I'll look to others, it's because it would be fun and make me feel good to do things for myself like that.

I tossed aside my regular deodorant this morning, used some nice fresh powder scented spray instead.  I wondered as I ""prettied up the kitchen"" (did the breakfast dishes and spruced things up) how far this would go.  My wife is a hairstylist...maybe if I grew my hair out a little, I could take a little step, get away from the boring old mannish cut, try something 'unisex'?

I should look for a therapist, figure out what's going on.  But seriously, I'll go out in heels and skirts if it turns out that's what it takes to keep my life on such a positive turn.

I'm a male and for the past few days I've been wearing my wife's underwear.  It's made me feel radically better about myself and my life, but I can tell it's been bothering my wife, so I'd been trying to think of ways to compromise with her, make it easier for her.

I let my wife sleep in - she'd had a rough night, tossing and turning, so I just got a sleepy answer from her on what kind of coffee she wanted me to brew for her and went on with showering and cleaning up the kid's breakfast dishes.

I went back in the bedroom to get dressed, and she was still sleeping.  I gathered my clothes, and looked across the room to her dresser - the top drawer filled with soft, satiny, pretty underthings.  Then I looked at my top drawer in front of me, filled with fresh clean menswear like I'd been wearing, except this week, every day of my life for decades.  I picked up a pair of men's underwear, put it down again.  I looked over at my sleeping, loving, probably a little freaked-out-at-me wife.

I didn't feel right taking her things without asking, and there was something appealing about asking her for the pretty thing to wear.  Then this pleasant little voice said, 'You should try a day in your regular underwear.  You'll be OK, and you really should find out if you *want* to do this or if you *need* to.'

I pulled on a pair of men's briefs, and immediately felt a tightness in my head, my chest.  The little vocie said 'You're OK, you're just getting yourself worked up.'  I stood there, leaning on my dresser, taking deep breaths...then I pulled myself out of the room, like I was grabbing each muscle of my legs with a puppet string.

I made it two steps out the bedroom door before my knees went out from under me.  I was at the top of the stairs, felt like I could barely breath or think, this overwhelming feeling of disaster taking over my mind.

The voice came up again, encouraging me.  'You can do this.  You can work through it.  That underwear is only a symbol, you can feel happy and normal without it.  Your wife will like it that you're strong enough.'  On and on it went, pushing me forward.

I pulled myself up the wall and held on, trying to make myself go down stairs, and then I realized something.

That negative voice, the one that had been whispering to me for more years than I could remember, telling me that I was worthless and had made so many mistakes, told me that no one would care if I died, the voice that had gone miraculously silent the day I slipped on a pair of women's underwear...it had always called me 'you'.  *You* made mistakes, *you* wouldn't be missed, *you* could just step in front of that truck and it would be over.  The positive voice, the one that only started up yesterday, it always said ""I"" and ""Me"".  ""I"" am doing work that is important.  People love *me*.  *I* am going to be OK.

I grabbed yesterday's 'pretty panties' off the top of the laundry hamper in front of me - they were still nice enough, one of the happy little obsessions about this is being very careful not to spoil them when I'm wearing them - and ran downstairs with them, put them on, buried the men's underwear in the bottom of a downstairs laundry bin.

I tried to eat some breakfast, but was still feeling incredibly jangled, upset.  I wanted to wake my wife and talk to her about it but I wanted to calm down first, I didn't want to scare her.

As I walked to work I was apprehensive at first, but with every step my mood improved - the negative voice was still silent, the positive voice was slowly coming back up into my awareness.  I wasn't as giddy as I'd been the past couple of days, and I'm still a bit unnerved from the experience.

I'm hoping for some useful recommendations from the local physician I know of, since this experience has warned me that counseling is necessary sooner rather than later.  I'm not looking forward to talking this episode over with my wife, as I think one problem with our relationship is that she's needed me to be strong for her for so long that it scares her to think of me as having weakness.

I'm betting that I need to be very, very careful about the steps I take in whatever this is - because it looks like there are unexpected consequences to trying to go back.

I had some errands to run today, including some grocery shopping while my wife was working.

I put them in the cart, and no alarms went off.  The gender police didn't swoop down on me, no mothers pulled their children away in shock, nobody laughed or pointed or rolled their eyes or anything - I was just a guy picking up stuff from the store, everyone in the aisles and the checkout completely ignored me, just like I'd hoped they would.

Funny thing was, when I got home, I noticed that I'd accidentally picked up a different size than I intended, two sizes smaller than I'd estimated from online sources, but they fit like they were made for me.

30,2013-03-10 03:22:32,1a0806,26,15,"**TL;DR:** Skip to ""So today,""

So. I live in a fairly small, fairly conservative town. I came here to go to community college for cheap, after living in a larger, more liberal city.

I think in the city, my dysphoria wasn't as apparent, because I could present myself any way I wanted without being ostracized. Now, however, the restrictive ideals of the small town I'm is has forced me to either conform to their ideals about gender, or be treated like I'm less than human. At first I conformed, I'm not even sure I was aware I was doing it.

Over time gender conforming felt more and more like a prison, until I finally broke down and decided my mind was absolutely-for-sure not female. I still don't really know what my ideal gender is, but for now calling myself genderqueer and going back to looking more decidedly androgynous has helped. There's still the problem of how people here see me.

In the city I felt that people, if the judged me at all, did so based on how I chose to present myself. Here, however, it feels like everybody's view of everybody else is colored by what gender they're perceived to be. There are very strong stereotypes here about the differences between males and females, men and women. I've found that it only gets worse if you try to present as something outside the gender binary. I've noticed a gradual increase in disapproval from my bosses at work, though my co-workers and friends have been great.

**So today,** I went into a local Great Clips to try to get a kind-of androgynous, punk-ish haircut, and I'm sitting there, trying to explain what I want, and the lady that's going to cut my hair has to call this other girl over, and they're still not getting it, and finally the kinda get it, and one of them says ""that's too complicated"" and the other one agrees and I'm thinking ""What the fuck? I thought you were supposed to know how to cut hair! I could get this exact thing so easily in Portland!"".

Anyway, they decide that they can't even try the haircut I want (I probably should have left at this point) and offer to get me some of their hair-styles books, and ask if I want women's or men's. I don't want either, but I say mens, and of course ALL of the hairstyles are significantly shorter than I want, except for maybe a handful that are longer than I want. I really don't know why I stayed at this point, or why I picked the one I did, but by the time I got home all of this frustration just turned into a huge crying fit, and a vow to never get my hair cut in this stupid little town.

My wife is trying to be understanding, but it isn't helping that I really don't understand what's going on either.  Her latest attempt to help consisted of her hearing me say ""I like the way this underwear makes me feel"" and understanding it as ""I like the way this underwear feels"".  She stopped by a store on her way home from work, and was smiling ear to ear as she handed me a pack of micro-fiber men's briefs.  She was sure she'd found the solution to all our problems, because this men's underwear, to her, felt and fitted the same as what I'd been wearing - I think she thought I could wear it and be happy, and all this would be over.

I thanked her and picked it up, and at her urging I tried it on.  She was so happy about it that it felt like the least I could do.  It was OK, I was allright - no emotional lift like *my* underwear, but no crushing feelings either.  We even made some jokes about her getting some just like it in her size if she thought it was so nice to wear.  Then she invited me to finish getting dressed and come downstairs to watch TV with the family.  She cheerily led the way, so pleased with herself for coming up with this clever fix for what was wrong.  I lagged behind, as the moment I thought of leaving the room wearing these I felt my legs go weak and I had to lean on the bed to keep from falling down.

I didn't collapse on the upstairs landing like the last time I tried to wear men's underwear, so that's progresss I suppose.  I did sit there downstairs for about fifteen minutes, responding like a robot to everything, even to something on the TV show where I was supposed to laugh, with a stomach twisting in knots and every muscle in my body so tight she could feel me shaking.

I excused myself, went upstairs to our bedroom and tore every stitch of clothing off like it was on fire.  I curled up under all the blankets in a corner of the bed, shaking like my body was coming apart, trying to make my breathing work properly again.

After a little while she came up and held me - worried about me, but I think a little angry that her gift hadn't fixed everything.  I told her I was embarrassed and ashamed at falling apart like that, but I didn't tell her I felt hurt because, at the moment, I felt like she would rather I was 'normal' than happy.  The feeling passed as she held me, and things felt much better that night.

That was two days ago.  Yesterday she was distant, diving into her artwork and being uncomfortable with hugs or kisses or anything when we passed close to each other.  This morning, before I got dressed, she was almost surly.  When I got her to talk, she said she didn't want to talk about this, she just wanted it to go away.  She told me about how when she was a little girl her mother got mad at her and ripped apart a pretty dress she just got that she really liked to wear, ripped it apart in front of her and splattered it with bacon grease - and how my wife wanted to do that to my new underwear, and hated feeling that way.

I passed her in the front room a few minutes later, on my way to work.  She looked me over, and in a voice made to tear me down said, ""You're wearing them, aren't you?""

I shouted at her ""NO I'M WEARING THE GODDAMN UNDERWEAR I'M SUPPOSED TO!!"" - pulled open my pants and showed her the white men's cotton briefs I'd worn all my life except for the past week and a half.  I was shaking so bad I could barely stand, even when I sat down my whole body felt like it was coming apart.

It felt like it was going to be a fight, it turned into a discussion.  She tells me it's OK, it's just underwear, I'm not doing anything wrong - she even tells me how much she loves the other changes I've been motivated to make, the way I care about my appearance at work, that I'm wearing my contacts so she can see my eyes, that I'm trying so much harder to connect with her.

She tells me she's not used to seeing me as a ""shriveled, shaking wreck"", and that everyone needs a ""crutch"" to feel good about themselves.  She tells me it's OK to wear these if I need it, since she won't have to see it...so it's OK as long as I hide it from her so she doesn't have to think about it.  She tells me that she thinks that part of what's hurting me is shame about what I'm doing, but I don't have to worry as she won't tell anyone.

I went upstairs to change, and she came up and saw me putting the finishing touches on my work outfit, and the way I was standing tall and smiling and happy even after all this...and she pushed past me with an exasperated ""Oh God"" as she went to throw some clothing on to take me up to work.

She was distant and short with me on the drive - it's only a minute or two, I usually walk but was running late today.  I'll see her at lunch and see how things are going, but it looks like things will be worse before they'll be better.  It's like she's mad that she can't make me happy herself, or mad that I can have something besides her make me happy - and frustrated that she hasn't made me happy in the first place.

I'm seeing my doctor to get counseling for me the day after tomorrow.  I'm going to keep encouraging her to get counseling for herself, and for us.

37,2013-03-13 15:49:06,1a7xyr,10,10,"Sorry, this is going to be a tl;dr, and probably very frank.

These last three weeks have been awful. I am fighting depression, having trouble getting dressed, leaving the house, interacting with family. My best friend, who knows about my gender problems, told me last night that it seems like I haven't been comfortable in my own skin. 

I'm not sure what else I can do. I am wearing almost entirely men's clothing. I bind, and my breasts are really small, so my chest almost passes. My haircut maybe needs tweaking. I think it reads more ""lesbian"" than ""male"". I'm not even sure I want to read as male all the time, but it would be really nice to get misgendered and not have people falling all over themselves to correct it. I got sir'd the other day and the guy apologized like twelve times and I said ""it's okay, you're mostly right"" and he said ""Why, that's an awful thing to say!"" :/

My body just feels wrong. My hips are too wide. My shoulders are too narrow. I have a classic hourglass figure. I can kinda hide it, but not entirely. My voice doesn't sound like mine. My name doesn't sound like mine. Hearing someone say my name makes me wonder who they're talking to.

I have been thinking a lot about where this all comes from, what's causing it. I'm not happy with some other things in my life too, this isn't all of it. I am making progress towards changing those things, but I just wonder if this is something to focus on since I'm largely unhappy anyhow. I wonder if I feel like I need to make changes because I am angry about what social things being a woman means. How much of this is social, and how much of it is who I really am? For some reason it seems okay to me if it's organic, but not if it's social. I don't know why.

I was thinking a lot about my childhood yesterday, trying to piece some things together. I was permitted to dress largely as I wanted until I was about 8. I found my kindergarten pictures, and I really do look like a little boy. My mom decided at some point that she'd had enough of having a tomboy and that I was going to be a girl whether I liked it or not. Around 8 years old, I started having panic attacks. There were a lot of other things going on - my mother was very controlling about other things too, but it hadn't occurred to me that the anxiety I had all through childhood might have been related to my gender. 

I'm wondering if it's time to start considering some more biological changes, such as hormones. I need to get in touch with my therapist again, probably. I'm fascinated by the idea of having a deeper voice and being able to grow facial hair. I'm drawn to that. But I'm also terrified. Those things aren't really things I can hide.

48,2013-03-16 04:52:08,1ae8ps,2,9,"I'm having kind of a difficult evening and I was wondering if I could get some insight. 

I'm a 23-year-old male-bodied person. I've always identified as a man even while being aware of the Transgender and Genderqueer communities, the difference between gender and sex, and the difference between gender identity and gender expression. I've always been most comfortable with a slightly feminine appearance until I've discovered Androgyny which I've found to be my ideal form of expression but neither changed my gender identity. 

I've grown my hair long my whole life, more than halfway down my back, and have a sense of body dysphoria relating to my facial hair that has lead me to pursue laser hair removal, otherwise I don't have any strong feelings about my body hair or other feelings of body or gender dysphoria. I sometimes shave my legs and always shave under my arms, but I don't feel strongly about having them shaved or not. In fact I don't feel really strongly in any way about appearing fairly masculine or appearing feminine. I'm pretty comfortable with either form of dress and don't really think of it as being super comfortable or uncomfortable. I feel fully at home if I'm presenting androgynously and it makes me extra comfortable to do so. I used to marker my nails black for a while in grade school until I felt uncomfortable about people mentioning it and only started painting them regularly (still only black) a year ago. Occasionally I'll wear eye-liner and I would do so more if I was better at applying it. I also wear concealer, mostly to try to cover up my 5 o'clock shadow. I have never considered myself to be crossdressing regardless of which sex my clothing was designed for. 

The most time I've ever spent questioning my gender identity was when I was dating a wonderful Trans woman that wasn't entirely sure whether I was Cis based on some of the things I expressed. The questioning went kind of like this: ""Hmm.. how do I feel about my body? This is a pretty okay shape. Penis? That's cool. How would I feel about breasts? Eh, not really into having breasts. I don't want to change my body. I'm not Trans."" I pretty much left it there and I've tried to avoid identifying my expression under the Trans* umbrella because I didn't match up to that idea.

I was writing a blog post tonight about being a ""Political Man"" in that I do all of these things but still feel that I should strongly assert my manhood because I think that being a man should include the possibility of skirts and makeup and it's better for society to do away with a lot of masculine tropes. I was also talking about the fact that I don't really have a problem with being misgendered because I have Cis privilege, all of this stuff.. blah blah.. the gist of it being that whatever I do while identifying as a man should be valid for men. Which kind of made me think about why I identify that way when I don't express that way, and whether I had any reasons OTHER than to make a political statement. I realized that I'm not sure if anything draws me to that identity other than wanting to do activism that targets assumptions about men. 

Now I'm feeling really lost. I don't feel like I fit anything I've heard about genderqueer people. I've always been comfortable in my binary, but I'm not entirely sure if that's because I'm just a man and that's that, or if I've shaped my conception of ""man"" to fit my identity for other reasons. I'm really confused and trying not to cry, and I'm not even sure why I feel like crying.

For some of those who wouldn't have transitioned without the internet this would be bad, there's a solution [physical/medical transition] that would work well for them, and they wouldn't have found it without the web.


But i vaguely suspect that some people are worse off for the ""support"" found on the web. People who've found transition works for them seem to push it as the right answer for everyone? And also it's very easy to get obsessed with things on line. 


I started my reddit account today and went on a bit of a trans binge, and by this afternoon i was feeling more dysphoric about my sex than i have been in years. It was weird, i can't even pinpoint the connection.


I didn't start this reddit account because i was dysphoric, i was procrastinating about something i'm supposed to write, so it was not an underlying high dysphoria day, though it MAY have been a coincidence. 


Normally it doesn't bother me, having a different body is a pleasant fantasy, but i'm usually no more upset by not having this than i am by not being able to fly or not having as much money as Gina Rinehart, or any other nice fantasy, it would be nice to have it, but i don't feel too bad that i don't. (Well maybe a bit more upset than the bit about flying, but you get what i mean?) 


But this afternoon after my trans web binge i was lying staring at the ceiling feeling unusually wretched. Dwelling on gender/sex dysphoria on line really seems to make it worse? Does anyone else get that?


I worry about a lot of people who'd be more happy as a physically unmodified queer being pushed into transition. Something that could be a quite open-minded and body-positive outlook becomes a bit too obsessive and upsetting. 


I even worry the same about gay people from unusually conservative backgrounds. They have been brought up to think there are two ways to be, straight guy or straight girl. If they come across the transition solution it's likely to be very appealing. 


Some web forums seem somewhat insular and almost cult-ish. It's totally acceptable to tell someone that they should transition, but not ok to tell them that they shouldn't. I particularly remember Susan's Place a few years ago, i came across quite a few people there who i thought should really consider other solutions, but there was no way to say this, the forum just didn't allow dissenting views. I concluded for myself that a physical/medical transition was not right for me, but i'm generally pretty rebellious to both authority and peer pressure. From what i hear of humans in general, a lot of people really value being part of a group?

There's been a lot of times when I've been down because of life, depression, gender disphoria, etc and I've wanted to talk with likeminded peers. There's communities, forums, chatrooms, etc, for teens and for GQ/transgender, but, even after a lot of searching, I didn't really feel like I found what I was looking for, so I have some questions.

*How old are you all? Are there many other young GQ/TG/queer people that don't feel like they have a community that really fits them?

*Is there a queer teen community that has a good amount of GQ folks? I'm sorry if this sounds rude and it's nothing against any communities like this, but most LGBT places I've gone to seemed too... mainstream? They're great places, but a 'normal' LGBT place just doesn't seem to work for me.

*Is there interest in a community for teen/college age queer/GQ if there isn't a good one out there I'm missing? I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel if there are fitting places already, but if there aren't, I'd be interested in helping to start such a community. Forums + chatroom + resources would be great.

As a GQ/etc teen, it sucks that I can find a good teen community that doesn't understand being queer, or a good queer community that is full of adults who only care about adult issues, but I don't feel like I have access to anyone who is really 'like me'. I'm just tired of feeling alone, and if there's other young queers out there who feel the same, I'd like to help.

I played with my brothers' toys (I only have brothers, 3 of them), I preferred to play with boys, I asked for boy toys for christmas on a couple occasions, I went through a phase in middle school where I dressed like a boy, in high school I watched dragonball z, various kung-fu movies, listened to metal/rock (korn, slipknot) drew and played video games and hung out with the grungy neighborhood skaterish guys. I love football (RGIII!) and have held traditionally male jobs (software developer, now a park ranger). All of this of course is in addition to doing girly things too. I had barbies and baby dolls and later hello kitty and all that good stuff too but I was never big on dresses or heels and makeup. I had the best of both worlds.

I have never been bothered by the fact I'm female, only by people's reactions to it. I don't understand why it is so odd for a girl to want an rc car for christmas or for a girl to do boy things.

I have had crushes on girls but no sexual desires for women. I do feel like I ""think like a man"" 80-90% of the time. 
So my question to all of you is, am I just a tomboy? Is gender dysphoria necessary to label oneself as genderqueer? Are all tomboys genderqueer?

Basically, I'm a matryoshka doll of gender. I'm a FAAB androgyne who enjoys belly dancing and video games. I like binding while wearing frilly shirts and can only view myself sexually as a male. I don't mind if people think I'm a girl as long as my hypothetical partner is understanding that I am certainly not a woman.

Seven years ago, as soon as I was legally able, I started hormones and had surgery. I became relaxed, calm, comfortable, happier than I'd ever been. I felt like myself. I felt good in my own skin, finally.

Within the last year, something has disturbed that peace again. I dated someone who transitioned then decided they're genderqueer. At first I thought nothing of it. Gender is fluid, people change and have the right to define themselves how they see fit.

I guess it got under my skin, though. That and an old friend of mine who retransitioned years ago. More and more, I began to doubt the basis of my own gender, the one real certainty I'd held onto for the last decade.

What if I'm 'really' a woman and could only come to terms with that through this transition? Maybe I'm just a very odd sort of man. Or I could be something else altogether. I struggle with this option the most. In theory, I've always wholeheartedly supported genderqueer theory. Of course there are more than two genders, of course we can live outside of the restrictions this culture imposes. 

Part of me can't seem to see past those constraints. Even as I adore and support non-binary identity, a part of me struggles to hold their reality in mind. Is this just the external pressure of a culture that wants to erase any possibility other than 'woman' or 'man'? The same pressure I threw off to transition in the first place?

Then there's the practical aspect of my resistance to applying a non-binary identity to myself. How can I make it work in practice? Given that our culture does not recognize these gender possibilities, what gender would I rather be mistaken for? How to cope with dating, binarist sexualities? Socializing in general - explain yourself constantly and possibly alienate most people or let them make the mistakes that erase you?

Most of all, it doesn't feel right. I don't want this. I don't think I'm strong enough to live in the liminal space, to exist in between.

I'm fairly out as trans and I do my best to educate the people around me, but I'm grateful that because of my passing privilege, when I don't feel like educating, I don't have to explain myself.

Well, I say accidentally, since I meant to say it at the time, but I hadn't exactly planned it beforehand.  I was in training with a handful of coworkers and my manager, and the topic was political correctness under a ""communicating with respect"" theme.  

Essentially the argument came up over unisex toilets.  Two people in the room commented that they felt confronted and uncomfortable in unisex toilets that had been installed at a local attraction, and that their existence was an unnecessary political correctness.  I responded that having the option there was very important to certain demographics (i.e. the trans* and queer folk of the world).


They commented that so few people fell into that category that it didn't really matter.  I said that more people did than they knew; and that in fact *I* did.  I said straight up that I don't identify as my birth-assigned gender.  I challenged them and asked whether I had the right to have the option of using a bathroom where *I* felt comfortable.


One of the two thought about what I'd said, and said that she hadn't thought about it that way before, and in that light she could see why it was more important than she'd considered (she is pretty cool).  The other clearly wasn't as accommodating, but allowed that he couldn't hold it against me personally, and since we were in a training that was all about communicating with respect he couldn't really say any more (thankfully).


Through all this, my manager sat and observed pensively.  I tried not to look at his reactions while I was talking; while I think very highly of him considering the short period I've worked under him, and knew he'd be professional about it, I was still worried about what he would think on a personal level.

Immediately after the discussion concluded, I couldn't help but steal a glance at him. ...He looked pleased.  Genuinely, satisfied and pleased.  I don't think he had any idea beforehand (I had been presenting as totally cis, new workplace and all), but he's always said he values diversity very highly and is something of a champion for a few minority groups' recognition and rights in our business.


After the training concluded, he didn't say a word.  We went back to our team and work proceeded as normal, but he *did* seem to be in a good mood for the rest of the afternoon.  I now feel like I can come into work presenting as myself in future and that it will be totally ok- though I'll ease into it, for my own sake as much as anyone else's!

Hi. I'm Al.

So! I identify as androgynous, though I'll go through periods of fluidity. I don't really care, though it seems that all of my boyish or gender neutral clothing is always dirty whenever I am feeling more manly, because Murphy's Law. I've never really found my neutral tendencies to be bothersome, though I have to admit there are times when I am acutely aware of not being female (which is my sex).

I took a gender neutral name, have a nice gender neutral online persona, have a gender neutral pseudonym for my writing...

Have breasts the size of cantaloupes... 

And therein lies my discomfort. I can look on a mirror and be perfectly happy... As long as I don't look below my shoulders. Tried a binder once, borrowed from a trans friend of mine. Did wonders for him, just gave me torpedo uniboob. I've since lost some weight, and thank gods I've lost some there, too... Not a lot, but enough that I notice. Thought about trying a binder again, but I'm too poor to buy one right now. Not sure I'm prepared to drop the cash on it with such a risk of failure is at hand... But I really, really hate my breasts. Always have.

Hnn...

The other bane of my existence is that no one seems to get it. I have a penchant for cute things... Also, as an artist, I am very keen on aesthetics. For some reason these things are associated with femininity, and thus have been used as evidence against me and my gender identity. ""You like X-girlie thing, so you're a woman."" What about the X-boy things I like, or the gender neuter things? Or the fact that my likes and dislikes don't actually dictate my gender identity? I have a hard time trying to explain it to people... I get frustrated, especially when they try to get out of it by way of, ""whatever you say (even though I still think you're mental).""

And I have no idea how to explain it to my mother, much less my father...

They call me by my given name, though, and I can't stand it. My parents gave me a very feminine (and annoyingly old fashioned) name, and it doesn't suit me. I figure if I could make them understand the need for my neutral name, perhaps I could get them to call me by it, but... They're old fashioned folk, and, as I said, I have no idea of how to explain it to them.

I work in a grocery store. A couple of months ago I got my hair cut in a very short, boyish style. The first time a little kid asked their mum if I was a boy or girl made me so happy. Oh, how I wish I could have told them I was neither, because I think the kids can get it much more easily. I like my job, though, so I kept my happiness quietly...

I dunno... Maybe I'm having more trouble getting used to this than I thought I was? I have no issues with myself, gender wise, but often when I'm around other people I feel like I can't be myself, because to them I'm being ""that girl.""

17,2013-03-05 00:28:23,19o8t2,8,11,"Hello! My name is Jake. I have a few questions for all of you beautiful people! 

I see a lot of speech through out about identities and such. From what I know, there are those that associate as males, there are those that associate as females, and there are people who are gender-fluid, which tend to switch between the two. Is that correct? What do you refer to somebody who doesn't really care for or feel like they have a gender? For example, I am biologically male, but I don't really feel like a guy, nor do I really feel like a girl. I just feel like myself, to give a poor explanation. A person without a sexuality is referred to as asexual; is a person without an associated gender agender? Does it work like that?

I've started to dress a bit more femininely. To continue on the aforementioned explanation, I'm not trying to dress feminine because I feel feminine, but just because I like some dresses and some typically female clothing. Are there any good places that sell either androgynous clothes or female clothes that still fit a male (For example, I do not have breasts). [Here's an example of my body type plus the first dress I just bought!](http://imgur.com/a/C9SJW)

As I've started wearing dresses, I figure that it's good to shave my legs (plus they feel pretty nice now), but it's a bit difficult. How do you people get the upper-back of your legs, if you do shave? In addition, how  often do you shave your legs? My legs still feel like they're a bit stubbly, even after shaving with a three-blade women's razor. How could I get a closer shave? With my underarms, it's even harder to get a close shave.

I've told my parents that I'm going to be dressing a bit differently and they are fine with that, so I'm starting to dress around the house to get comfortable with my new clothes. Is there anything I should know before wearing these new clothes in public (I am a senior in high school and a student of a college)? I expect to get some odd stares at first, but that's not a big issue!

I'm a (MtF) trans, taking hormones for about 9 months now. About a month ago, I was raped by one of my closest friends who knew me before I started my transition and I'm so scared to do anything about it. 
It was the weekend before I turned eighteen, so a group of my friends took me out for dinner. Afterwards, we all split up and walked home and I was alone with **him**, when he asked if I wanted to stay at his house and call for a ride home. It started hailing really bad, and since his house was closer, I agreed.
When we got to his house, we were both soaking wet and freezing, so instead of calling my parents straight away, I took a few minutes to warm myself upstairs. I got ready to take out my phone, when he, completely naked, comes through the door, grabs my arm and throws my bag aside. I was so shocked that I didn't realize that he was pulling me into his bedroom until it was too late.
He ordered me to strip or he'll hurt me. I initially refused, thinking that this was just a really bad joke, until he punched and kicked me so hard I thought my bones would break. I took off everything except for my bra and undies, and he grabbed my arm again and pushed me onto the bed. Yelling at him, he forcibly removed the rest of my clothing despite my protests, and when I got fully undressed, I realized what a vulnerable position I let myself be in.
I begged him to just let me go, but he responded with things like *""You had this coming,""* and *""You should be happy you're getting laid at all.""* I asked him if he would really do this to a friend. He answered, *""You didn't have to be this girly.""* 
His grip on my arm was really hurting me at that point, and I just wanted to avoid angering him, so I stopped protesting, and what he did next is not something I can bring myself to tell in detail right now. It was incredibly painful, like I was getting crushed and ripped apart at the same time. I was both humiliated and in agony... so much that I wished to die right then, and right now I think I still wish for that.
He abused me for hours until he stopped and went to bed. I cried silently to myself until I could hear his snores. Too afraid to call anyone, I sneaked out early in the morning and ran home in the cold. My parents must have thought I was over at a friend's, so they didn't bother texting me. Afterwards, I kept everything that happened to myself. 
He later said he was sorry over a text, and wanted to continue being my friend if we could forget the whole thing. I told him to leave me alone, but he continues to message me about the incident, saying *""You didn't even hate it since you didn't pass out like real rape victims.""* I've been avoiding him ever since but I can only pretend it didn't happen for so long.

Sorry for that huge read but I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do... I'll feel guilty if I'm responsible for throwing him in jail by pressing charges, and I don't want my other friends finding out that I got raped, or anyone knowing that I'm trans. I'm terrified of him and frightened that he might attack me again. I feel like he could pop out of anywhere behind me and drag me back to his home. I'm scared of revealing this to my boyfriend, because I don't want him to see me in such a pitiful state. I just don't know what to do anymore and I absolutely want nobody to find out about this...

20,2013-03-05 17:06:53,19prfq,9,44,"Male here, married, kids.  I'd been running into this gray rut of apathy and depression for years, gradually, like a frog being boiled to death in water that gets hot too slow for him to notice.  A negative voice was my constant mental companion, whispering to me that I'd made wrong choices, that nobody would care if I died, even helpfully conjuring dark scenarios to 'help' me figure out how to dramatically end everything, either alone or even with lots of company.  Not to be too maudlin about it, but I was too miserably apathetic to even consider getting help, the idea that things could get better seemed childishly ridiculous.

I was getting dressed two days ago and I sat there holding my clothes, looking at a pair of my wife's underwear that was sticking out of a drawer.  I still don't know where it came from, this impulse to put them on.  All I know is that the moment they slid up my hips it felt like my skull...loosened.  Like a squeeze of pressure that had been there so long it was considered normal was gone.

I felt...better.  For the first time in what might be a decade I felt like things were going to be OK, in a life where before I hadn't ever even thought of that as an option.  I didn't know why or how things were going to be OK, it just seemed like everything being OK was as normal as the sun coming up in the morning.

I let the feeling push me along that afternoon.  It just didn't seem right to be wearing ""such pretty panties"" (they were actually more underwear than panties, I'm not sure of the difference but the cheery melody in my head happily didn't care) while still having so much body hair on my legs and arms, so I shaved everywhere I could reach, getting it smooth and nice as best I could.  I was clumsy about it in some places, one leg has some cuts that still sting a bit, but I was even cheerful about that.  I tried on the contact lenses that my wife had pushed me to try months and months ago, and the inconvenience of putting them in that had so annoyed me - I'd only worn them for a couple of days at first - seemed silly, they made me look good and I could see my eyes.  I put my black metal hard-edged glasses away, hoping I wouldn't have to wear them much again.

My wife noticed her underwear sticking out of my clothes a little bit that evening when I was leaning over to load the washing machine, and she laughed harder than I'd heard her laugh in years.  The kids wondered what was going on, we told them a story about me making a face that just caught her off guard.  Later she had some questions, I told her that I was in a silly mood...she accepted it, but was wondering if I was OK - and she was a little put off at me taking her things without asking.

Yesterday was a Monday.  A dark, grey-skied wintry Monday, at a job that had been grinding me down.  I walked to work wearing a pair of satiny women's underwear under my regular clothing, my sharp-edged glasses sitting at home, and everything was beautiful.  The slippery sidewalks were like a game, the wintry breeze was invigorating, the black birds against the white snow were poetic...I laughed out loud at nothing in particular while walking to work...and that nagging, whispering negative voice, for the first time since I could remember, was completely silent.

All through the day and into the evening I was cheerful.  The computer games and endless Internet scanning that I'd been numbingly retreating into for years didn't attract my interest - I cleaned things up instead, did what I could to make my house as pretty and cheerful as I felt inside.  I participated in the evening meal's conversation, I watched tv while actually chatting with family members - and none of it was pretend or forced, it all just felt right.

That night, when we were alone, I told my wife about how I'd felt happy all day, and I told her about the existence of the negative voice and how it had gone suddenly, wonderfully silent.  She was happy for me, happy I'd shared it with her, felt sad for me that I'd been facing it so long.  We laughed together about it, I can love how this experiment is affecting me and still know feel that there's a silliness to it.  She's worried about what I'm going through, and still doesn't quite know how to process her man wearing her underwear.

I'm in my second full day in women's underwear.  The happiness is still bubbling along inside, and I hope it's come to stay for a while.  I find myself taking stairs instead of elevators as my job takes me from building to building and office to office, because I want my body - not ""this body"", but ""my body"" - to feel healthier and look better.  I look at myself in the mirror and smile...and a different voice, not a whisper but full of life, told me that people love me, that what I do is important, and that I'm worth caring about.

The new voice is a funny mix of encouragement to make things better and happiness with how I am.  I don't have to change, but I would love it if I did...if I got healthier, maybe got rid of the grey hair that was creeping in...it isn't because I have to, or because of how I'll look to others, it's because it would be fun and make me feel good to do things for myself like that.

I tossed aside my regular deodorant this morning, used some nice fresh powder scented spray instead.  I wondered as I ""prettied up the kitchen"" (did the breakfast dishes and spruced things up) how far this would go.  My wife is a hairstylist...maybe if I grew my hair out a little, I could take a little step, get away from the boring old mannish cut, try something 'unisex'?

I should look for a therapist, figure out what's going on.  But seriously, I'll go out in heels and skirts if it turns out that's what it takes to keep my life on such a positive turn.

27,2013-03-06 15:12:52,19s0km,15,14,"I'm in my third day of [trying something different](http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/19prfq/first_couple_of_days_of_gender_transgressions_i/), and had a hard time this morning.

I'm a male and for the past few days I've been wearing my wife's underwear.  It's made me feel radically better about myself and my life, but I can tell it's been bothering my wife, so I'd been trying to think of ways to compromise with her, make it easier for her.

I let my wife sleep in - she'd had a rough night, tossing and turning, so I just got a sleepy answer from her on what kind of coffee she wanted me to brew for her and went on with showering and cleaning up the kid's breakfast dishes.

I went back in the bedroom to get dressed, and she was still sleeping.  I gathered my clothes, and looked across the room to her dresser - the top drawer filled with soft, satiny, pretty underthings.  Then I looked at my top drawer in front of me, filled with fresh clean menswear like I'd been wearing, except this week, every day of my life for decades.  I picked up a pair of men's underwear, put it down again.  I looked over at my sleeping, loving, probably a little freaked-out-at-me wife.

I didn't feel right taking her things without asking, and there was something appealing about asking her for the pretty thing to wear.  Then this pleasant little voice said, 'You should try a day in your regular underwear.  You'll be OK, and you really should find out if you *want* to do this or if you *need* to.'

I pulled on a pair of men's briefs, and immediately felt a tightness in my head, my chest.  The little vocie said 'You're OK, you're just getting yourself worked up.'  I stood there, leaning on my dresser, taking deep breaths...then I pulled myself out of the room, like I was grabbing each muscle of my legs with a puppet string.

I made it two steps out the bedroom door before my knees went out from under me.  I was at the top of the stairs, felt like I could barely breath or think, this overwhelming feeling of disaster taking over my mind.

The voice came up again, encouraging me.  'You can do this.  You can work through it.  That underwear is only a symbol, you can feel happy and normal without it.  Your wife will like it that you're strong enough.'  On and on it went, pushing me forward.

I pulled myself up the wall and held on, trying to make myself go down stairs, and then I realized something.

That negative voice, the one that had been whispering to me for more years than I could remember, telling me that I was worthless and had made so many mistakes, told me that no one would care if I died, the voice that had gone miraculously silent the day I slipped on a pair of women's underwear...it had always called me 'you'.  *You* made mistakes, *you* wouldn't be missed, *you* could just step in front of that truck and it would be over.  The positive voice, the one that only started up yesterday, it always said ""I"" and ""Me"".  ""I"" am doing work that is important.  People love *me*.  *I* am going to be OK.

I grabbed yesterday's 'pretty panties' off the top of the laundry hamper in front of me - they were still nice enough, one of the happy little obsessions about this is being very careful not to spoil them when I'm wearing them - and ran downstairs with them, put them on, buried the men's underwear in the bottom of a downstairs laundry bin.

I tried to eat some breakfast, but was still feeling incredibly jangled, upset.  I wanted to wake my wife and talk to her about it but I wanted to calm down first, I didn't want to scare her.

As I walked to work I was apprehensive at first, but with every step my mood improved - the negative voice was still silent, the positive voice was slowly coming back up into my awareness.  I wasn't as giddy as I'd been the past couple of days, and I'm still a bit unnerved from the experience.

I'm hoping for some useful recommendations from the local physician I know of, since this experience has warned me that counseling is necessary sooner rather than later.  I'm not looking forward to talking this episode over with my wife, as I think one problem with our relationship is that she's needed me to be strong for her for so long that it scares her to think of me as having weakness.

I'm betting that I need to be very, very careful about the steps I take in whatever this is - because it looks like there are unexpected consequences to trying to go back.

It\'s made me feel radically better about myself and my life, but I can tell it\'s been bothering my wife, so I\'d been trying to think of ways to compromise with her, make it easier for her.\n\nI let my wife sleep in - she\'d had a rough night, tossing and turning, so I just got a sleepy answer from her on what kind of coffee she wanted me to brew for her and went on with showering and cleaning up the kid\'s breakfast dishes.\n\nI went back in the bedroom to get dressed, and she was still sleeping.  I gathered my clothes, and looked across the room to her dresser - the top drawer filled with soft, satiny, pretty underthings.  Then I looked at my top drawer in front of me, filled with fresh clean menswear like I\'d been wearing, except this week, every day of my life for decades.  I picked up a pair of men\'s underwear, put it down again.  I looked over at my sleeping, loving, probably a little freaked-out-at-me wife.\n\nI didn\'t feel right taking her things without asking, and there was something appealing about asking her for the pretty thing to wear.  Then this pleasant little voice said, \'You should try a day in your regular underwear.  You\'ll be OK, and you really should find out if you *want* to do this or if you *need* to.\'\n\nI pulled on a pair of men\'s briefs, and immediately felt a tightness in my head, my chest.  The little vocie said \'You\'re OK, you\'re just getting yourself worked up.\'  I stood there, leaning on my dresser, taking deep breaths...then I pulled myself out of the room, like I was grabbing each muscle of my legs with a puppet string.\n\nI made it two steps out the bedroom door before my knees went out from under me.  I was at the top of the stairs, felt like I could barely breath or think, this overwhelming feeling of disaster taking over my mind.\n\nThe voice came up again, encouraging me.  \'You can do this.  You can work through it.  That underwear is only a symbol, you can feel happy and normal without it.  Your wife will like it that you\'re strong enough.\'  On and on it went, pushing me forward.\n\nI pulled myself up the wall and held on, trying to make myself go down stairs, and then I realized something.\n\nThat negative voice, the one that had been whispering to me for more years than I could remember, telling me that I was worthless and had made so many mistakes, told me that no one would care if I died, the voice that had gone miraculously silent the day I slipped on a pair of women\'s underwear...it had always called me \'you\'.  *You* made mistakes, *you* wouldn\'t be missed, *you* could just step in front of that truck and it would be over.  The positive voice, the one that only started up yesterday, it always said ""I"" and ""Me"".  ""I"" am doing work that is important.  People love *me*.  *I* am going to be OK.\n\nI grabbed yesterday\'s \'pretty panties\' off the top of the laundry hamper in front of me - they were still nice enough, one of the happy little obsessions about this is being very careful not to spoil them when I\'m wearing them - and ran downstairs with them, put them on, buried the men\'s underwear in the bottom of a downstairs laundry bin.\n\nI tried to eat some breakfast, but was still feeling incredibly jangled, upset.  I wanted to wake my wife and talk to her about it but I wanted to calm down first, I didn\'t want to scare her.\n\nAs I walked to work I was apprehensive at first, but with every step my mood improved - the negative voice was still silent, the positive voice was slowly coming back up into my awareness.  I wasn\'t as giddy as I\'d been the past couple of days, and I\'m still a bit unnerved from the experience.\n\nI\'m hoping for some useful recommendations from the local physician I know of, since this experience has warned me that counseling is necessary sooner rather than later.  I\'m not looking forward to talking this episode over with my wife, as I think one problem with our relationship is that she\'s needed me to be strong for her for so long that it scares her to think of me as having weakness.\n\nI\'m betting that I need to be very, very careful about the steps I take in whatever this is - because it looks like there are unexpected consequences to trying to go back.\n\n**tl;dr:** I\'ve been wearing women\'s underwear for a couple of days to generally positive feelings of self, tried wearing men\'s underwear and pretty much fell apart.

I put them in the cart, and no alarms went off.

44,2013-03-10 03:22:32,1a0806,26,15,"**TL;DR:** Skip to ""So today,""

So. I live in a fairly small, fairly conservative town. I came here to go to community college for cheap, after living in a larger, more liberal city.

I think in the city, my dysphoria wasn't as apparent, because I could present myself any way I wanted without being ostracized. Now, however, the restrictive ideals of the small town I'm is has forced me to either conform to their ideals about gender, or be treated like I'm less than human. At first I conformed, I'm not even sure I was aware I was doing it.

Over time gender conforming felt more and more like a prison, until I finally broke down and decided my mind was absolutely-for-sure not female. I still don't really know what my ideal gender is, but for now calling myself genderqueer and going back to looking more decidedly androgynous has helped. There's still the problem of how people here see me.

In the city I felt that people, if the judged me at all, did so based on how I chose to present myself. Here, however, it feels like everybody's view of everybody else is colored by what gender they're perceived to be. There are very strong stereotypes here about the differences between males and females, men and women. I've found that it only gets worse if you try to present as something outside the gender binary. I've noticed a gradual increase in disapproval from my bosses at work, though my co-workers and friends have been great.

**So today,** I went into a local Great Clips to try to get a kind-of androgynous, punk-ish haircut, and I'm sitting there, trying to explain what I want, and the lady that's going to cut my hair has to call this other girl over, and they're still not getting it, and finally the kinda get it, and one of them says ""that's too complicated"" and the other one agrees and I'm thinking ""What the fuck? I thought you were supposed to know how to cut hair! I could get this exact thing so easily in Portland!"".

Anyway, they decide that they can't even try the haircut I want (I probably should have left at this point) and offer to get me some of their hair-styles books, and ask if I want women's or men's. I don't want either, but I say mens, and of course ALL of the hairstyles are significantly shorter than I want, except for maybe a handful that are longer than I want. I really don't know why I stayed at this point, or why I picked the one I did, but by the time I got home all of this frustration just turned into a huge crying fit, and a vow to never get my hair cut in this stupid little town.

I could get this exact thing so easily in Portland!"".\n\nAnyway, they decide that they can\'t even try the haircut I want (I probably should have left at this point) and offer to get me some of their hair-styles books, and ask if I want women\'s or men\'s. I don\'t want either, but I say mens, and of course ALL of the hairstyles are significantly shorter than I want, except for maybe a handful that are longer than I want. I really don\'t know why I stayed at this point, or why I picked the one I did, but by the time I got home all of this frustration just turned into a huge crying fit, and a vow to never get my hair cut in this stupid little town.\n\n**TL;DR:** Small-town hairstylists have no idea how to do hairstyles outside the gender binary.

Wearing it boosted my mood, my energy, made everything better...and not wearing it [made everything come crashing down hard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/19s0km/gender_transgressions_pushing_back_hurts/)

My wife is trying to be understanding, but it isn't helping that I really don't understand what's going on either.  Her latest attempt to help consisted of her hearing me say ""I like the way this underwear makes me feel"" and understanding it as ""I like the way this underwear feels"".  She stopped by a store on her way home from work, and was smiling ear to ear as she handed me a pack of micro-fiber men's briefs.  She was sure she'd found the solution to all our problems, because this men's underwear, to her, felt and fitted the same as what I'd been wearing - I think she thought I could wear it and be happy, and all this would be over.

I thanked her and picked it up, and at her urging I tried it on.  She was so happy about it that it felt like the least I could do.  It was OK, I was allright - no emotional lift like *my* underwear, but no crushing feelings either.  We even made some jokes about her getting some just like it in her size if she thought it was so nice to wear.  Then she invited me to finish getting dressed and come downstairs to watch TV with the family.  She cheerily led the way, so pleased with herself for coming up with this clever fix for what was wrong.  I lagged behind, as the moment I thought of leaving the room wearing these I felt my legs go weak and I had to lean on the bed to keep from falling down.

I didn't collapse on the upstairs landing like the last time I tried to wear men's underwear, so that's progresss I suppose.  I did sit there downstairs for about fifteen minutes, responding like a robot to everything, even to something on the TV show where I was supposed to laugh, with a stomach twisting in knots and every muscle in my body so tight she could feel me shaking.

I excused myself, went upstairs to our bedroom and tore every stitch of clothing off like it was on fire.  I curled up under all the blankets in a corner of the bed, shaking like my body was coming apart, trying to make my breathing work properly again.

After a little while she came up and held me - worried about me, but I think a little angry that her gift hadn't fixed everything.  I told her I was embarrassed and ashamed at falling apart like that, but I didn't tell her I felt hurt because, at the moment, I felt like she would rather I was 'normal' than happy.  The feeling passed as she held me, and things felt much better that night.

That was two days ago.  Yesterday she was distant, diving into her artwork and being uncomfortable with hugs or kisses or anything when we passed close to each other.  This morning, before I got dressed, she was almost surly.  When I got her to talk, she said she didn't want to talk about this, she just wanted it to go away.  She told me about how when she was a little girl her mother got mad at her and ripped apart a pretty dress she just got that she really liked to wear, ripped it apart in front of her and splattered it with bacon grease - and how my wife wanted to do that to my new underwear, and hated feeling that way.

I passed her in the front room a few minutes later, on my way to work.  She looked me over, and in a voice made to tear me down said, ""You're wearing them, aren't you?""

I shouted at her ""NO I'M WEARING THE GODDAMN UNDERWEAR I'M SUPPOSED TO!!"" - pulled open my pants and showed her the white men's cotton briefs I'd worn all my life except for the past week and a half.  I was shaking so bad I could barely stand, even when I sat down my whole body felt like it was coming apart.

It felt like it was going to be a fight, it turned into a discussion.  She tells me it's OK, it's just underwear, I'm not doing anything wrong - she even tells me how much she loves the other changes I've been motivated to make, the way I care about my appearance at work, that I'm wearing my contacts so she can see my eyes, that I'm trying so much harder to connect with her.

She tells me she's not used to seeing me as a ""shriveled, shaking wreck"", and that everyone needs a ""crutch"" to feel good about themselves.  She tells me it's OK to wear these if I need it, since she won't have to see it...so it's OK as long as I hide it from her so she doesn't have to think about it.  She tells me that she thinks that part of what's hurting me is shame about what I'm doing, but I don't have to worry as she won't tell anyone.

I went upstairs to change, and she came up and saw me putting the finishing touches on my work outfit, and the way I was standing tall and smiling and happy even after all this...and she pushed past me with an exasperated ""Oh God"" as she went to throw some clothing on to take me up to work.

She was distant and short with me on the drive - it's only a minute or two, I usually walk but was running late today.  I'll see her at lunch and see how things are going, but it looks like things will be worse before they'll be better.  It's like she's mad that she can't make me happy herself, or mad that I can have something besides her make me happy - and frustrated that she hasn't made me happy in the first place.

I'm seeing my doctor to get counseling for me the day after tomorrow.  I'm going to keep encouraging her to get counseling for herself, and for us.

56,2013-03-13 15:49:06,1a7xyr,10,10,"Sorry, this is going to be a tl;dr, and probably very frank.

These last three weeks have been awful. I am fighting depression, having trouble getting dressed, leaving the house, interacting with family. My best friend, who knows about my gender problems, told me last night that it seems like I haven't been comfortable in my own skin. 

I'm not sure what else I can do. I am wearing almost entirely men's clothing. I bind, and my breasts are really small, so my chest almost passes. My haircut maybe needs tweaking. I think it reads more ""lesbian"" than ""male"". I'm not even sure I want to read as male all the time, but it would be really nice to get misgendered and not have people falling all over themselves to correct it. I got sir'd the other day and the guy apologized like twelve times and I said ""it's okay, you're mostly right"" and he said ""Why, that's an awful thing to say!"" :/

My body just feels wrong. My hips are too wide. My shoulders are too narrow. I have a classic hourglass figure. I can kinda hide it, but not entirely. My voice doesn't sound like mine. My name doesn't sound like mine. Hearing someone say my name makes me wonder who they're talking to.

I have been thinking a lot about where this all comes from, what's causing it. I'm not happy with some other things in my life too, this isn't all of it. I am making progress towards changing those things, but I just wonder if this is something to focus on since I'm largely unhappy anyhow. I wonder if I feel like I need to make changes because I am angry about what social things being a woman means. How much of this is social, and how much of it is who I really am? For some reason it seems okay to me if it's organic, but not if it's social. I don't know why.

I was thinking a lot about my childhood yesterday, trying to piece some things together. I was permitted to dress largely as I wanted until I was about 8. I found my kindergarten pictures, and I really do look like a little boy. My mom decided at some point that she'd had enough of having a tomboy and that I was going to be a girl whether I liked it or not. Around 8 years old, I started having panic attacks. There were a lot of other things going on - my mother was very controlling about other things too, but it hadn't occurred to me that the anxiety I had all through childhood might have been related to my gender. 

I'm wondering if it's time to start considering some more biological changes, such as hormones. I need to get in touch with my therapist again, probably. I'm fascinated by the idea of having a deeper voice and being able to grow facial hair. I'm drawn to that. But I'm also terrified. Those things aren't really things I can hide.

- Surgery

- Name Changes

- Adapting pronouns and name changes.

I'm a 23-year-old male-bodied person. I've always identified as a man even while being aware of the Transgender and Genderqueer communities, the difference between gender and sex, and the difference between gender identity and gender expression. I've always been most comfortable with a slightly feminine appearance until I've discovered Androgyny which I've found to be my ideal form of expression but neither changed my gender identity. 

I've grown my hair long my whole life, more than halfway down my back, and have a sense of body dysphoria relating to my facial hair that has lead me to pursue laser hair removal, otherwise I don't have any strong feelings about my body hair or other feelings of body or gender dysphoria. I sometimes shave my legs and always shave under my arms, but I don't feel strongly about having them shaved or not. In fact I don't feel really strongly in any way about appearing fairly masculine or appearing feminine. I'm pretty comfortable with either form of dress and don't really think of it as being super comfortable or uncomfortable. I feel fully at home if I'm presenting androgynously and it makes me extra comfortable to do so. I used to marker my nails black for a while in grade school until I felt uncomfortable about people mentioning it and only started painting them regularly (still only black) a year ago. Occasionally I'll wear eye-liner and I would do so more if I was better at applying it. I also wear concealer, mostly to try to cover up my 5 o'clock shadow. I have never considered myself to be crossdressing regardless of which sex my clothing was designed for. 

The most time I've ever spent questioning my gender identity was when I was dating a wonderful Trans woman that wasn't entirely sure whether I was Cis based on some of the things I expressed. The questioning went kind of like this: ""Hmm.. how do I feel about my body? This is a pretty okay shape. Penis? That's cool. How would I feel about breasts? Eh, not really into having breasts. I don't want to change my body. I'm not Trans."" I pretty much left it there and I've tried to avoid identifying my expression under the Trans* umbrella because I didn't match up to that idea.

I was writing a blog post tonight about being a ""Political Man"" in that I do all of these things but still feel that I should strongly assert my manhood because I think that being a man should include the possibility of skirts and makeup and it's better for society to do away with a lot of masculine tropes. I was also talking about the fact that I don't really have a problem with being misgendered because I have Cis privilege, all of this stuff.. blah blah.. the gist of it being that whatever I do while identifying as a man should be valid for men. Which kind of made me think about why I identify that way when I don't express that way, and whether I had any reasons OTHER than to make a political statement. I realized that I'm not sure if anything draws me to that identity other than wanting to do activism that targets assumptions about men. 

Now I'm feeling really lost. I don't feel like I fit anything I've heard about genderqueer people. I've always been comfortable in my binary, but I'm not entirely sure if that's because I'm just a man and that's that, or if I've shaped my conception of ""man"" to fit my identity for other reasons. I'm really confused and trying not to cry, and I'm not even sure why I feel like crying.

I'm 24, I've been using a chosen gender-neutral name for 8 years, and I feel male. I think like a guy. I like stereotypical ""male"" things like working with tool, and cars, and baseball. As a child I played with bugs, and toy knights fighting toy dragons.

I also really like the female aesthetic. I don't wear makeup, but paint my nails, and pluck my eyebrows, and wear ""girl clothes"" about 50% of the time. I'm very curvy, so even when I'm wearing ""guy clothes"" I still don't read as male.

When I was 16 I identified as ftm, and tried to pass as male all the time. I started going to a gender dysphoria therapist, and doing research about hormones and surgery and all of that. I learned that surgery really wouldn't give me the body that I want, and that if I had been born male I would probably want to be androgynous and would dress like a girl sometimes.

I gave myself permission to look feminine sometimes, and felt so much better about myself. It didn't change my perception of myself, or my gender identity at all. I still felt male, I just felt more like me, more comfortable in my body. I still wish I had a penis, so much so that I can't orgasm unless I'm visualizing myself as having a male body.

I\'m 24, I\'ve been using a chosen gender-neutral name for 8 years, and I feel male. I think like a guy. I like stereotypical ""male"" things like working with tool, and cars, and baseball. As a child I played with bugs, and toy knights fighting toy dragons.\n\nI also really like the female aesthetic. I don\'t wear makeup, but paint my nails, and pluck my eyebrows, and wear ""girl clothes"" about 50% of the time. I\'m very curvy, so even when I\'m wearing ""guy clothes"" I still don\'t read as male.\n\nWhen I was 16 I identified as ftm, and tried to pass as male all the time. I started going to a gender dysphoria therapist, and doing research about hormones and surgery and all of that. I learned that surgery really wouldn\'t give me the body that I want, and that if I had been born male I would probably want to be androgynous and would dress like a girl sometimes.\n\nI gave myself permission to look feminine sometimes, and felt so much better about myself. It didn\'t change my perception of myself, or my gender identity at all. I still felt male, I just felt more like me, more comfortable in my body. I still wish I had a penis, so much so that I can\'t orgasm unless I\'m visualizing myself as having a male body. Apart from that I don\'t really have many body issues anymore. I like being able to look female, because I\'m a girly boy.\n\nAnyway, that\'s my story. I\'m new here, just wanted to share.

My big issue is figuring out what the best practices are for this. The AP stylebook says that transsexuals are people who change genders via surgery.

For some of those who wouldn't have transitioned without the internet this would be bad, there's a solution [physical/medical transition] that would work well for them, and they wouldn't have found it without the web.


But i vaguely suspect that some people are worse off for the ""support"" found on the web. People who've found transition works for them seem to push it as the right answer for everyone? And also it's very easy to get obsessed with things on line. 


I started my reddit account today and went on a bit of a trans binge, and by this afternoon i was feeling more dysphoric about my sex than i have been in years. It was weird, i can't even pinpoint the connection.


I didn't start this reddit account because i was dysphoric, i was procrastinating about something i'm supposed to write, so it was not an underlying high dysphoria day, though it MAY have been a coincidence. 


Normally it doesn't bother me, having a different body is a pleasant fantasy, but i'm usually no more upset by not having this than i am by not being able to fly or not having as much money as Gina Rinehart, or any other nice fantasy, it would be nice to have it, but i don't feel too bad that i don't. (Well maybe a bit more upset than the bit about flying, but you get what i mean?) 


But this afternoon after my trans web binge i was lying staring at the ceiling feeling unusually wretched. Dwelling on gender/sex dysphoria on line really seems to make it worse? Does anyone else get that?


I worry about a lot of people who'd be more happy as a physically unmodified queer being pushed into transition. Something that could be a quite open-minded and body-positive outlook becomes a bit too obsessive and upsetting. 


I even worry the same about gay people from unusually conservative backgrounds. They have been brought up to think there are two ways to be, straight guy or straight girl. If they come across the transition solution it's likely to be very appealing. 


Some web forums seem somewhat insular and almost cult-ish. It's totally acceptable to tell someone that they should transition, but not ok to tell them that they shouldn't. I particularly remember Susan's Place a few years ago, i came across quite a few people there who i thought should really consider other solutions, but there was no way to say this, the forum just didn't allow dissenting views. I concluded for myself that a physical/medical transition was not right for me, but i'm generally pretty rebellious to both authority and peer pressure. From what i hear of humans in general, a lot of people really value being part of a group?

93,2013-03-18 16:59:27,1aj716,11,12,"Hey, I'm a 19 year old genderqueer person.

There's been a lot of times when I've been down because of life, depression, gender disphoria, etc and I've wanted to talk with likeminded peers. There's communities, forums, chatrooms, etc, for teens and for GQ/transgender, but, even after a lot of searching, I didn't really feel like I found what I was looking for, so I have some questions.

*How old are you all? Are there many other young GQ/TG/queer people that don't feel like they have a community that really fits them?

*Is there a queer teen community that has a good amount of GQ folks? I'm sorry if this sounds rude and it's nothing against any communities like this, but most LGBT places I've gone to seemed too... mainstream? They're great places, but a 'normal' LGBT place just doesn't seem to work for me.

*Is there interest in a community for teen/college age queer/GQ if there isn't a good one out there I'm missing? I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel if there are fitting places already, but if there aren't, I'd be interested in helping to start such a community. Forums + chatroom + resources would be great.

As a GQ/etc teen, it sucks that I can find a good teen community that doesn't understand being queer, or a good queer community that is full of adults who only care about adult issues, but I don't feel like I have access to anyone who is really 'like me'. I'm just tired of feeling alone, and if there's other young queers out there who feel the same, I'd like to help.

Thanks all &lt;3

**[Edit 3/19/13]: Well folks, after seeing some young people on here and talking with some queer/ally friends, I'm going to work to make this happen. And soon.

I have a vagina and I'm all about it, but when I was younger I briefly wanted to be a boy. I played with my brothers' toys (I only have brothers, 3 of them), I preferred to play with boys, I asked for boy toys for christmas on a couple occasions, I went through a phase in middle school where I dressed like a boy, in high school I watched dragonball z, various kung-fu movies, listened to metal/rock (korn, slipknot) drew and played video games and hung out with the grungy neighborhood skaterish guys. I love football (RGIII!) and have held traditionally male jobs (software developer, now a park ranger). All of this of course is in addition to doing girly things too. I had barbies and baby dolls and later hello kitty and all that good stuff too but I was never big on dresses or heels and makeup. I had the best of both worlds.
I have always been attracted to masculine guys but I'm getting married in a couple weeks to an effeminate guy who has been assumed gay in the past. Our story is worthy of a whole 'nother post but the point is there's even role reversal in my relationship.
I have never been bothered by the fact I'm female, only by people's reactions to it. I don't understand why it is so odd for a girl to want an rc car for christmas or for a girl to do boy things. The focus has never been ""why am I so weird"" but ""why are other girls so weird."" I guess I don't really experience gender dysphoria, most of the time I was worried about not being physically girly enough (small boobs, no hips). 
I have had crushes on girls but no sexual desires for women. I do feel like I ""think like a man"" 80-90% of the time. 
So my question to all of you is, am I just a tomboy? Is gender dysphoria necessary to label oneself as genderqueer? Are all tomboys genderqueer? I am not looking to label myself, I am comfortable identifying as a female, but I feel like this is a very blurry area. Or maybe I am like a cat that thinks he's dog; this is the only normal I know.

I am planning to run the Marine Corps Marathon for the Human Rights Campaign, but need to get to $1500 in donations as soon as possible to be one of the 50 people who gets to run for them.

My spouse is transgender, so I'm doing it for her. I first found out about it several years ago when we were still dating (we've been dating since high school actually, and now are almost 30). At first I was shocked and didn't know what to do, but my partner introduced me to Jennifer Finney Boylan's memoir and a couple other books that resonated with me at the time. We talked it out then and we're still together now. 

I think it's incredibly brave and amazing that you guys come out and then make it through the transition process. I'm running to support your right to transition, your right for respect, your right for health care coverage and education, your right for marriage and choice. 

This is an issue that has become important to me in the last several years, though I've always been a supporter of LGBT issues in general. I'm just always shocked by how the 'T' tends to get ignored or discriminated against by the rest of the 'LGB'. 

Anyway... I'm rambling now. The point is, I was hoping you guys could consider either making a donation or passing on this missive to others who might be interested in donating to the cause. I would really appreciate even just a dollar. Anything. I want to run for the HRC.

My individual HRC Athlete site is here:

137,2013-03-28 03:18:32,1b5mjd,10,29,"Ten years ago, I stumbled headfirst into a revelation that my gender wasn't what I'd been told all my life, that I was a man, that I could live as one and change my body too. Seven years ago, as soon as I was legally able, I started hormones and had surgery. I became relaxed, calm, comfortable, happier than I'd ever been. I felt like myself. I felt good in my own skin, finally.

Within the last year, something has disturbed that peace again. I dated someone who transitioned then decided they're genderqueer. At first I thought nothing of it. Gender is fluid, people change and have the right to define themselves how they see fit.

I guess it got under my skin, though. That and an old friend of mine who retransitioned years ago. More and more, I began to doubt the basis of my own gender, the one real certainty I'd held onto for the last decade.

What if I'm 'really' a woman and could only come to terms with that through this transition? Maybe I'm just a very odd sort of man. Or I could be something else altogether. I struggle with this option the most. In theory, I've always wholeheartedly supported genderqueer theory. Of course there are more than two genders, of course we can live outside of the restrictions this culture imposes. 

Part of me can't seem to see past those constraints. Even as I adore and support non-binary identity, a part of me struggles to hold their reality in mind. Is this just the external pressure of a culture that wants to erase any possibility other than 'woman' or 'man'? The same pressure I threw off to transition in the first place?

Then there's the practical aspect of my resistance to applying a non-binary identity to myself. How can I make it work in practice? Given that our culture does not recognize these gender possibilities, what gender would I rather be mistaken for? How to cope with dating, binarist sexualities? Socializing in general - explain yourself constantly and possibly alienate most people or let them make the mistakes that erase you?

Most of all, it doesn't feel right. I don't want this. I don't think I'm strong enough to live in the liminal space, to exist in between. I don't have the energy to fight for recognition 24/7, to face constant confusion and disgust, to worry about how people are reading me or which bathroom to use. I'm fairly out as trans and I do my best to educate the people around me, but I'm grateful that because of my passing privilege, when I don't feel like educating, I don't have to explain myself.

I'm sick of gender. I don't want to think about it all the time any more. I don't want to experiment, explore, grow my hair out or buzz it or deal with any of this. I stopped T a month or so ago for reasons not totally clear to me so I guess I'm in deep now. I just want to spend my energy on other things.

Well, I say accidentally, since I meant to say it at the time, but I hadn't exactly planned it beforehand.  I was in training with a handful of coworkers and my manager, and the topic was political correctness under a ""communicating with respect"" theme.  

Essentially the argument came up over unisex toilets.  Two people in the room commented that they felt confronted and uncomfortable in unisex toilets that had been installed at a local attraction, and that their existence was an unnecessary political correctness.  I responded that having the option there was very important to certain demographics (i.e. the trans* and queer folk of the world).


They commented that so few people fell into that category that it didn't really matter.  I said that more people did than they knew; and that in fact *I* did.  I said straight up that I don't identify as my birth-assigned gender.  I challenged them and asked whether I had the right to have the option of using a bathroom where *I* felt comfortable.


One of the two thought about what I'd said, and said that she hadn't thought about it that way before, and in that light she could see why it was more important than she'd considered (she is pretty cool).  The other clearly wasn't as accommodating, but allowed that he couldn't hold it against me personally, and since we were in a training that was all about communicating with respect he couldn't really say any more (thankfully).


Through all this, my manager sat and observed pensively.  I tried not to look at his reactions while I was talking; while I think very highly of him considering the short period I've worked under him, and knew he'd be professional about it, I was still worried about what he would think on a personal level.

Immediately after the discussion concluded, I couldn't help but steal a glance at him. ...He looked pleased.  Genuinely, satisfied and pleased.  I don't think he had any idea beforehand (I had been presenting as totally cis, new workplace and all), but he's always said he values diversity very highly and is something of a champion for a few minority groups' recognition and rights in our business.


After the training concluded, he didn't say a word.  We went back to our team and work proceeded as normal, but he *did* seem to be in a good mood for the rest of the afternoon.  I now feel like I can come into work presenting as myself in future and that it will be totally ok- though I'll ease into it, for my own sake as much as anyone else's!

http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/03/01/should-trans-surgery-be-covered-ctd/

As I've mentioned before, and as I've tweeted Andrew Sullivan, most insurance plans do not rely on the cosmetic procedures exclusion clause to ensure they do not have to pay for trans surgery.

I'm someone that is struggling to find a way to get SRS.  I've noticed the American trans community does not really like to talk about the struggles, frustrations, and disappointment inherent to the American trans experience of trying to get medically necessary trans-related care, but they love to talk about the individual successes.  Some part of me thinks I have a shot, but even if I can change it I want to change the tenor of the discussion.  You see, when it comes to getting medically necessary care, things are bad, really really bad for most American trans people; just focusing on the positives and successes all the time misses the elephant in the room.

I think this tendency to focus only on the positive and to ignore the negative (no more how pertinent) is an inherently American one, so I expect to get fierce resistance in this discussion from many of the American posters here, but I'm not worried about it, because it needs to be said.  However, I think this tendency to ignore the negative may be part of the reason why things are so bad for the American trans community in this matter.

Basically, if I'm able to get SRS and if I talk about it, I'll get all these people going, Wow, great job!  Wow good for you! and all that good stuff, while someone who is really stuck in transition and can't afford it and who may be dealing with functional impairments (like those related to schizoaffective disorder) would just be left to wallow in despair, with nothing but silence out of their mouths.

I don't want to contribute to the problem mentioned in the linked article about of the voices of struggling trans people always getting ignored.  If reporters come to me about my experience of SRS, if and when I finally get it, I will talk about the trans woman with schizoaffective disorder.

Today at 4pm I came home after school and I showed him a picture of my room which I took with his camera. I use his camera more often than him and I also use this to take my cross-dressing pictures. After I showed him the picture of my room I deleted it whilst he was holding the camera. The next picture that popped up was a recent one of me in pantyhose and high heels... I tried to grab the camera out of his hands to delete the picture (I was so damn sure of I deleted it!) but it was too late. He asked me what I was wearing in that picture and I honestly said it were my pantyhose and heels. I asked where I got them and I replied honestly saying I got them about two years ago. He asked me right after whether I had feelings for girls or boys and I said I like girls (I'm pansexual but I think it's a little much to give him everything in one sitting, plus I like girls better and I haven't had any experiences with boys yet). I asked him whether he thought different of me and he said that he'd love me no matter what, to which he added that it isn't a simple situation I'm in, which I confirmed with a humming sound.

I asked him whether he had any questions and he said we'd talk tomorrow (we're the 6th of march '13 now). I hope he'll have questions which I can honestly answer and that we can figure a way out to make me on the outside as I feel on the inside.

Thank you all for reading, please share some experiences and/or advice.

If you have any questions please ask them.

I asked him whether he thought different of me and he said that he'd love me no matter what, to which he added that it isn't a simple situation I'm in, which I confirmed with a humming sound.\n\nI asked him whether he had any questions and he said we'd talk tomorrow (we're the 6th of march '13 now). I hope he'll have questions which I can honestly answer and that we can figure a way out to make me on the outside as I feel on the inside.\n\nThank you all for reading, please share some experiences and/or advice.\n\nIf you have any questions please ask them.\n\n**Edit**: My dad didn't talk to me today, I didn't ask for anything myself because I don't want to push him."", 'subreddit': 'transgender', 'title': 'Coming out to my dad', 'created': 1362552567.0}",

I'm pretty much your classic case of 'girl trapped in a boy's body', only, I've just recently decided that I should do something about it.

I'm probably slightly androgynous in outlook anyway, and for the longest time, I've managed to convince myself that that was enough that I didn't REALLY need to do anything about it.

I've since come to realize that this isn't the case, settling for 'ok...I guess' isn't going to be enough for me when I know what I'm missing.

Anyway, my problem is that I'm afraid I've waited to long to take this seriously. I'm 29, which feels old, and I've allowed myself to get a bit too heavy. (I'm 184cm (6foot) and 117kg's (257 lbs)

Although I feel that with time, my face is definitely passable, I have the sort of physique where, if I lost some of the extra flab, you could hire me to play Superman. (not the Hulk, but still)

I've been working out a lot in the past couple of months, and I worry about whether hrt would impact my losing weight. Since Ideally, I'd like to drop a lot of weight, but obviously, losing the fat and then the muscle mass makes the most sense.

I guess I'm just worried that with current technology, I'm just never going to get any sort of end result that I'd be happy with.

I've got a consultation with a doctor specializing in gender dysphoria next week, so after that I'll have way more information, but still, I wanted to get some information from people in a similar situation.

289,2013-03-21 15:36:29,1aqj3b,3,13,"Just a suggestion. 

The pronoun game. It's a difficult part of transition. Getting your friends and family, if you're lucky enough to have them, to switch the gender pronouns they have called you the entire time they have known you. Though I had my surgery over a year ago and have been ""full time"" since then, it's still hard for me to refer to myself by the masculine gender when speaking in the third-person. It feels strange and at times silly, but after all this is the path I chose.

My point is, every now and then when you're hanging out with your people and they're nailing the proper pronouns all night long, pull one aside and thank them for doing just that.

I feel like my arguments were invalidated by the fact that they know I\'m pansexual... Actually to be fair, all they know is that I have a girlfriend, and I used to have a boyfriend...Gah.\nI\'m so sad... I just want it to be ok for me to do whatever... I want to go on hormones loads and I don\'t even know if I\'m transgender yet! Ahh... And it hurts my feelings when people take the piss out of me for looking like a man, the people who do it don\'t even know me... I wish I could talk to someone about this, but my two best friends are two of the most un-accepting guys about this sort of thing and I\'m not yet close enough to my girlfriend to discuss it with her... I just need someone\'s support, but I have no one... I hate myself and my body so much, I feel like I\'m gonna start self harming again, not because I\'m addicted, but because I just hate my body so much I feel it needs to be destroyed... This is how the self harm started in the first place... I wish I had been born male.... So much. I wish I\'d just wake up without boobs. I wish I could start again, and going to uni so close to home is just making things worse, but how could I turn down an offer from one of the best unis in the country... I hope none of my friends ever stumble across this, because if you know me, you could tell it was me...
