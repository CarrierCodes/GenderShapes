21,2019-05-01 19:58:15,bjloxw,16,36,"So after I started T gel (2.5mg/day), I switched insurers. When I ran out of my Rx, and the new insurers took a minute to approve it, then insisted on shipping it to me rather than let me pick it up at a pharmacy. Which means there was about two weeks when I was off T.

I know some of us genderqueers/nonbinaries are interested in going on T and then stopping after a certain amount of change, so I thought I'd write this up.

At the end of 1 month on T I'd had a fair amount of bottom growth - about doubling my size, experiencing a lot of random hardons. I'd been sweating more heavily, my face had broken out, and a dirt 'stache was coming in on my upper lip. My libido was also way up. 

By the end of the first week off T, my libido had taken it down a notch. Spontaneous boners went away. In combination with a lot of Benzoyl soap and salicylic face toner, my acne subsided. The mustache and bottom growth stayed, but didn't advance. Second week continued the same. 

Results: Coming off T was pretty easy for me, no withdrawal symptoms. Temporary effects reversed almost immediately and changes stopped in their tracks. T appeared to clear my system in a matter of days. Conclusion: In this sample group of one, results indicate that taking T for a period and then stopping after desired physical changes occur is totally feasible.

27,2019-05-01 21:17:46,bjmmjv,3,11,"Trigger warning: sexual abuse, bullying mentioned.

I've realised that my common solution to my problems is 'change your physical body'. I've used the gym for the last 12 years (on and off) to try to change my body. I've wanted to change my body out of a sense of dislike of my self and my body. I hated my body, so i tried to change it repeatedly. Each time, instead of making my body more like i want (slimmer), it would instead bring my binge eating disorder to the surface and my resting weight would instead increase. 

This stems from my childhood - being bullied at school and home for being different/outside the norm in most things,  and also sexual abuse in my 20s which exacerbated that issue and caused me to reject attraction to others, sexuality and self love.

I now weigh 104kg. I'm bald, hairy/fuzzy, not flexible. But i love dancing and walking and stretching. 

From now on, my motto is 'don't change your body intentionally'. Funny thing is, i have recently been considering hrt to grow breasts and take on a more feminine body shape. Firstly,  being overweight as I am means that typically, I won't see the changes as much. But also that this is another form of me trying to change myself. 

It's going to be hard but I'm instead going to put those plans on hold and focus on liking myself exactly as I am. Expressing my true self, being myself and enjoying myself. I saw true inner beauty in another person yesterday,  which means in starting to see my own. 

Also, last night i dreamt there were two women in the basement of my house who were bad people and i was courageously confronting them and wanting to fight them and get them out of my house. I feel like its symbolic of my journey to release juju.

You know how you can meet another person, find them attractive, have common interests/values, and feel like the ""intangibles"" are right? That's me and this person. I'm not oblivious. The chemistry is there. 

To me, they appear to be an attractive, athletic female. That's how I've thought of them since we met a few weeks ago. We've been hanging out after runs, and I learned that they identify as nonbinary (they use ""they""). 

I'm posting here because I don't want to unintentionlly hurt someone I like by saying or doing something dumb. However, there are so many questions going through my head I don't know how to even begin to approach this issue. 

This person would either be a great friend or a dream girlfriend. My grey matter is having a hard time handling the grey areas. Hell, the term ""girlfriend"" might even be inappropriate. Reconciling binary sexual attraction with nonbinary identity seems hard.

We\'ve been hanging out after runs, and I learned that they identify as nonbinary (they use ""they""). \n\nI\'m posting here because I don\'t want to unintentionlly hurt someone I like by saying or doing something dumb. However, there are so many questions going through my head I don\'t know how to even begin to approach this issue. \n\nThis person would either be a great friend or a dream girlfriend. My grey matter is having a hard time handling the grey areas. Hell, the term ""girlfriend"" might even be inappropriate. Reconciling binary sexual attraction with nonbinary identity seems hard. \n\nBasically, there\'s cool new nonbinary person in my life and they\'re hot. I\'ve also had a few shots of vodka as I\'ve been writing this, so apologies if I\'ve gotten dumber or more nonsensical as the post goes on.

82,2019-05-03 03:40:49,bk4021,12,23,"Hello. This is my first time ever making a post on reddit, but I really needed to say this somewhere.
3 years ago I told my parents I'm non-binary and that the name I go by now is Elliot. At the time they seemed to kinda understand, and said they would try their best. 3 years have passed, and they haven't even once called me by the right name. I tried talking to them again a few weeks ago, and was met with a completely different response. They say it's too difficult for them, to know someone for 21 years and call them a certain name only to be asked to call them by another. I told them I had already given them 3 years to adapt. They don't even remember the initial conversation.
We ended up dropping the conversation and I was too scared to actually press any further. 
Still, I went and got my name changed at my university (as a social name). Today they questioned me about it again. They refuse to understand how important this is to me and keep comparing it completely different things. They questioned me on my choice a foreign name, even though our country has no name that could be considered unisex.
They repeat the same things about giving them time to adapt, and how they can't just suddenly change the way they call someone, but they haven't even made an effort to change.

I'm sorry for sounding so negative, but I'm losing hope and I don't feel like they respect me at all.

Hello everyone, my name is bru and I am AMAB. I'm from Brazil - sorry bout the bad english :) 

&amp;#x200B;

In recent years, I have been thinking about how I view my gender and have come very close to the non-binary community, although I have never used this term to talk about myself.  I feel comfortable thinking that I am a boy - although I have never recognized myself in manhood in general. I also express myself in a little feminine way sometimes - but I do not feel comfortable being seen as ""an effeminate boy.""  A few times people think I'm a masculinized lesbian, trans man or butch. I feel quite comfortable being wrongly labeled with all these identities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I think I would feel completely comfortable if I could be seen as someone whose gender was not relevant or determining, but being AMAB and comfortable in dressing in a neutral / ""masculine"" way makes it very difficult to understand myself as a valid non-binary boy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I'm Feu!  
Non-binary, 21 years old, moved out into my own apartment about 4 years ago, working full time, trying very hard to adult my way through life.

I see my parents roughly every 2-3 weeks for a day or two. I don't really have the best relationship with my dad (we tend to fight a lot over nothing), but I absolutely adore my mother.  
She means the world to me and she is a super sweet lady and I really _really_ don't want her to feel bad because of me.

Despite being from a small and conservative village, my family is very accepting - they support me a lot in my transition.

They started calling me by my chosen name immediately after me asking them to (with a lot of slip-ups but they usually just correct themselves most of the time).  
My mum showed me that they had changed my name in their contacts to ""Chosen name (Birth name)"".

Which is making me feel a bit conflicted, I don't particularly hate my birth name - it's just super gendered. Which is also why I don't really want it associated with me...

She told me, that she doesn't want to make me feel guilty or regret telling them, but that she would like to express a feeling she's had ever since I told them my chosen name.  
(And I love this kind of communication - letting people know what you feel, with _them_ knowing that it's not meant to hurt them)  
So, she said that she feels sad about me sort of ""rejecting"" the name they picked for me.

How can I help them to not feel as bad about it?

I would also really love to hear from parents with trans kids - and how they felt, when their kid told them about having chosen a new name for themselves :)",NonBinary,How can I help my parents deal with the fact that I am dropping the name they gave me?,1557201771.0,"{'created_utc': 1557176571, 'id': 'blhnfg', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'First off:  \nHi, I\'m Feu!  \nNon-binary, 21 years old, moved out into my own apartment about 4 years ago, working full time, trying very hard to adult my way through life.\n\nI see my parents roughly every 2-3 weeks for a day or two.

I'm on a full dose of HRT, I've had FFS, laser (for facial hair), done voice/speech feminization training, and also recently had bottom surgery (vaginoplasty). I've been incredibly happy with the results of all of these things, especially bottom surgery. For what it's worth, I've been passing as female for about 1.5 years.

Now that I'm at a point where my transition is basically ""completed"", I'm finding that I don't really feel like I'm a woman.

Part of the issue is that I feel 0% male. Like, if you were to plot my gender on some line or graph, male wouldn't even be included anywhere on it. If you drew a line between two points, they'd be ""agender"" and ""female"" and I'd probably be at some point in the middle, gender neutral with hints of fem-ness. When I try to express that though, there's a fear I'll be read as male again :(

Another part of the issue is that by accepting this part of myself, I'm afraid of it meaning I lose access to female spaces or worse, get directed back into male ones. I'm afraid of being branded an outcast, and either rejected or treated differently.

Hi Everyone! TLDR: I'm AFAB and 8 years into non-binary transition and I want to tell you what I did/am doing because I wish I had access to this information in the beginning! Pronoun town: they/them

What it means for me to be non-binary is secondary sex characteristics give me dysphoria. When I started T I thought I would just pass as a man over time and didn't feel good about it. Turns out that's definitely not what's happening for me- which I personally really works for me. 

I've been on T for 8 years. I am non-binary and going on T was an experiment for me. I started with a cream and changed to a shot later. As soon as I had enough T in my system to feel the effects I realized I wasn't depressed anymore and it completely changed my emotional landscape in a way that was amazing.

I was started to have hair loss (runs in the family) and that's a dysphoria nightmare for me so I have been on Finasteride for about 7 years. It prevents balding and also slows the growth of facial and body hair. It can also slow clitoral growth but it that's already happened for you it tends to not affect it. Finasteride can affect people's sex drives but it's never had any side effects for me. If you get the bigger pills and cut them into fourths it's way cheaper. Finasteride prevents you from losing your hair and will help some of it grow back. You have to stay on it as long as you're on T. My hairline has changed and I've had a little bit of hair loss but otherwise I'm so grateful for Finasteride!

I went on shots around 1 year in. I was still having periods and I increased my T really gradually in order to be on the lowest amount I could while not bleeding. That turned into a years long problem because I had a high red blood cell count when on enough to stop bleeding but then every time I lowered it I would get my period which was the worst. I tried to get an IUD (Mirena) but this just gave me horrible cramps everyday for 3 months so I got it out and decided to get a hysto. I got a laproscopic hysto and it was so chill and easy!

I just have tiny little scars on my abdomen because they take it out trans vaginally. Recovery was really fine- I was off opiate pain meds within three days. I decided to get out my uterus and my cervix and kept my ovaries (in case I go off T someday). You have to have some sex hormones in your body for bone health so I wanted to make sure I didn't have to take E later if I wanted to switch it up.

This was covered my insurance (Kaiser) after providing letters from therapists. I kept my letters binary because I don't trust insurance companies to understand or respect non-binary transition.

For some people their cervix can feel like part of sexual pleasure and they want to keep it. Orgasms change because it turns out uterine spasms are part of orgasms- but honestly it's all good. And talking to other folks too- we have no regrets.

Getting a hysto was so that I could be on a lower dose of T and not worry about bleeding. I'm currently on .25 a week.

I changed my shots from IM to sub cu in the last 6 months. It turns out that Dr Joanna Olsen (an amazing doctor for trans youth in LA) has discovered that IM has really sped up the hair loss process for people because it results in a really high spike of DHT each time you do a shot-which is what causes balding. She thinks since she's switching her patients to sub-cu she's going to see a lot less hair loss.

I am Italian so body hair and facial hair is REAL. And gives me a lot of dysphoria. After being able to get a hysto and be on less T I decided to get laser on my torso and face. I got a groupon kind of deal so it was half off. Laser hurts real bad but it's pretty effective. I might do electrolysis in the future since laser is semi-permanent. 

I wish I had gotten a hysto within my first year of being on T- if I had then I would've stayed on the cream based T and on a low dose. The cream works a lot slower and so does being on a low dose- and is recommended for folks who want to be on T but don't want facial hair growth. I just didn't want to bleed- and I wish someone had told me how easy and great a hysto could be.

Since I was able to get laser I felt like I could move ahead with top surgery. Since I don't want to be perceived as a man or a woman my dysphoria is really about balancing that. I got top surgery about a year ago and it's so nice to not have dysphoria about my chest. 

I decided to go with Dr. Mangubat in Tukwila, WA. I have mixed feelings about my experience but the reason I went with him is it seemed more likely that I would have nipple sensation and I do. Nipple sensation is really important to me and I really still have it. I wish this was something we talked more about and I wish the scientific world studied things like this to figure out how trans people can still experience pleasure.

After electrolysis (I never want to shave my face again!) I think I'll be done with the 1000 step process of non-binary transition. I'm femme so in the world in general people usually call me she- which tbh is less dysphoric than being called he. Sometimes people think I'm trans-feminine and in general even trans folks can't tell which direction I'm transitioning. So I pretty much have reached androgynous angel level- that is my dream.  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 feel free to ask questions and share this info.

About a year ago, I came to term with the fact that I am not cisgender. I'm still questioning the specifics (am I nb? A trans guy? Something else entirely?) but my doctor and I decided that it would probably be a good idea for me to go on puberty blockers. I'm 17, but that would keep my puberty from ending (to make it easier for me if I eventually wanted to go on T), and would also make me look a bit more androgynous. I could thus explore how much I like it and it should help me figure some stuff out.

The thing is, since I talked about it with my parents, I feel very discouraged about it all, and also sort of ashamed. It hurts them so much that I'm even considering transitioning, and I really wish I were cis so it could be easy for them. I don't want to be a burden to my family. I hate this feeling, and I feel like I'm betraying them. They also make me question everything, and I just feel so miserable.

I am currently in treatment for an eating disorder but I am planning to be discharged in about a month. Recently I've been backsliding a lot in terms of following my meal plan and avoiding behaviors. It all boils down to the fact that since weight restoration and the Return of the Menses, my dysphoria has been through the roof. It hasn't been this bad since I was \~11-13 (after puberty, before ED) and I don't know how to cope without going back to my ED to control my body again. 

To my dismay, I am a very feminine looking person and my weight congregates around my chest, hips, and face. I bind and wear clothes that somewhat conceal the curves I have but it still feels intolerable. When I was sick, people would call me ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" almost equally because I looked so androgynous. Now it's just WOMAN LADY FEMALE GIRL MISS MA'AM \*everywhere\* I go. Hopefully if insurance pulls through I'll be going on hormone blockers soon to prevent the ""second puberty"" and potentially low-dose T later on. I also really want to get top surgery. 

But I don't know how to cope with these feelings right now. I feel hopeless and like I'll never be comfortable in my body ever again if I don't go back to my ED.

349,2019-05-10 17:49:58,bn1e8t,6,4,"Hi all,

I've been trying to sort through my gender issues lately and I'm not sure what to think of it all. I'm mostly wondering if anyone here can relate to my struggles and it would be nice to just get some outsiders' perspective of it all. I'm sorry that this is so long, it's been building up inside for many years with no outlet. 

I've been able to go through life as a woman up until now, at 23. But not in a way that I've ever been comfortable with. I've always had massive image and identity issues from as long as I can remember; I remember being 5 years old and hating the way I looked so much that my parents couldn't get me out of the house sometimes. This is the main thing that makes me question whether my tentative self-identification as agender is just another way I try unsuccessfully to escape this self of mine that just never feels like myself. I went through a tough mental health journey, but lately things are looking up for me - I just graduated uni doing something I love, I'm finally financially stable, I have a boyfriend I love dearly. My mental health has been slowly improving as well, I struggled with crippling anxiety that has been subsiding to manageable levels within the last half year or so. Basically I'm probably in the best mental place I've been in life so far. Things are finally looking up. And without the immediate things to take up my attention like anxiety attacks, continuous uni assessments and constant worrying about where I'll be a in a year's time, my brain decided that it's time to bring back the gender issues I had as a teen (for a few years I was questioning whether I might be MtF) and have been keeping numbed down and stashed away all this time. 

This is also probably triggered by a slight bit of weight gain which my boyfriend claims makes me look more 'womanly and healthy' - there are few words I'd rather less be described by than 'womanly'. It creates a sense of wrongness within me that after all these years of purposefully numbing it down still manages to make me uncomfortable.

About my actual gender issues: I avoid calling it dysphoria because I doubt this is what full on gender dysphoria would feel like. This is unpleasant, but can mostly be pushed away. I go for long stretches of time where I feel almost ok with my body. It never feels like /my/ body per say, just a body, that is fine in itself. But I guess this ties heavily into the fact that I never had much of a sense of physical identity in the first place.

If I could press a button and magically switch genders I would. I'm an androgynous woman, but I'd be much more comfortable as an androgynous man. I've been daydreaming of what my life would be like if I'd transition, but the truth it I'm too afraid to come out and too afraid of the length of the road ahead of me. I'm in a precarious balance where I am in discomfort, but perhaps not enough discomfort to bite the bullet and go all the way. But then I ask myself the eternal question: am I just trying to escape myself in a different way?

I am very uncomfortable with what society deems I must do in life, and how I must do it, because I was born female. I have intense social norm woman dysphoria but I think this is more of a symptom of the restrictive society we live in than of me as a woman.

That said, I don't mind my female name or female pronouns. I'm pretty sure I'd be comfortable with any pronouns. I don't mind that people can tell I'm a woman by my voice or body size or whatever else it is that gives me away. It's more of an aesthetic sense of displeasure if that makes sense. The shirts I wear don't quite fit right with breasts, my own voice is too high pitched and it doesn't sound like /my voice/. I wish my chest was flat and I wish I had some stubble.

Then I ask myself 'what good even is it to have a pleasing sense of identity. My body is a tool that allows me to do the things I love doing - what more do I need? Is this not normal? Is pretty much everyone not unhappy with themselves on some level? I try to convince myself that the sense of contentment when looking at yourself in the mirror is a frivolous luxury; that it's shallow and meaningless. Yet I feel robbed of something. I am so deeply uncomfortable.

I don't even know what coming out as agender could accomplish. It's not going to make my 'womanly shapes' any less womanly, it's not going to allow me to change anything about myself that can be changed. Maybe it would be some sort of freedom from what I perceive other people's expectation of me to be. But then shouldn't I just work harder on not letting what I think people think get to to me instead?

Basically, I'm tired. The person I see in the mirror isn't myself, and at points like now it gets too much and I just can't feel good about myself. I'm very happy with my fashion sense, with my style, with the manifestation of myself that I can control - this feels right and rewarding and brings me happiness. The body that lies underneath doesn't.

Thank you for reading if you've made it thus far. I would love to know what you think.",NonBinary,Hardcore questioning,1557535798.0,"{'created_utc': 1557510598, 'id': 'bn1e8t', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 4, 'selftext': ""Hi all,\n\nI've been trying to sort through my gender issues lately and I'm not sure what to think of it all. I'm mostly wondering if anyone here can relate to my struggles and it would be nice to just get some outsiders' perspective of it all. I'm sorry that this is so long, it's been building up inside for many years with no outlet. \n\nI've been able to go through life as a woman up until now, at 23. But not in a way that I've ever been comfortable with. I've always had massive image and identity issues from as long as I can remember; I remember being 5 years old and hating the way I looked so much that my parents couldn't get me out of the house sometimes. This is the main thing that makes me question whether my tentative self-identification as agender is just another way I try unsuccessfully to escape this self of mine that just never feels like myself. I went through a tough mental health journey, but lately things are looking up for me - I just graduated uni doing something I love, I'm finally financially stable, I have a boyfriend I love dearly. My mental health has been slowly improving as well, I struggled with crippling anxiety that has been subsiding to manageable levels within the last half year or so. Basically I'm probably in the best mental place I've been in life so far. Things are finally looking up. And without the immediate things to take up my attention like anxiety attacks, continuous uni assessments and constant worrying about where I'll be a in a year's time, my brain decided that it's time to bring back the gender issues I had as a teen (for a few years I was questioning whether I might be MtF) and have been keeping numbed down and stashed away all this time. \n\nThis is also probably triggered by a slight bit of weight gain which my boyfriend claims makes me look more 'womanly and healthy' - there are few words I'd rather less be described by than 'womanly'. It creates a sense of wrongness within me that after all these years of purposefully numbing it down still manages to make me uncomfortable.\n\nAbout my actual gender issues: I avoid calling it dysphoria because I doubt this is what full on gender dysphoria would feel like. This is unpleasant, but can mostly be pushed away. I go for long stretches of time where I feel almost ok with my body. It never feels like /my/ body per say, just a body, that is fine in itself. But I guess this ties heavily into the fact that I never had much of a sense of physical identity in the first place.\n\nIf I could press a button and magically switch genders I would. I'm an androgynous woman, but I'd be much more comfortable as an androgynous man. I've been daydreaming of what my life would be like if I'd transition, but the truth it I'm too afraid to come out and too afraid of the length of the road ahead of me. I'm in a precarious balance where I am in discomfort, but perhaps not enough discomfort to bite the bullet and go all the way. But then I ask myself the eternal question: am I just trying to escape myself in a different way?\n\nI am very uncomfortable with what society deems I must do in life, and how I must do it, because I was born female. I have intense social norm woman dysphoria but I think this is more of a symptom of the restrictive society we live in than of me as a woman.\n\nThat said, I don't mind my female name or female pronouns. I'm pretty sure I'd be comfortable with any pronouns. I don't mind that people can tell I'm a woman by my voice or body size or whatever else it is that gives me away. It's more of an aesthetic sense of displeasure if that makes sense. The shirts I wear don't quite fit right with breasts, my own voice is too high pitched and it doesn't sound like /my voice/. I wish my chest was flat and I wish I had some stubble.\n\nThen I ask myself 'what good even is it to have a pleasing sense of identity. My body is a tool that allows me to do the things I love doing - what more do I need? Is this not normal? Is pretty much everyone not unhappy with themselves on some level? I try to convince myself that the sense of contentment when looking at yourself in the mirror is a frivolous luxury; that it's shallow and meaningless. Yet I feel robbed of something.

Hey. So I'm in an awkward spot gender-wise at the moment, where I'm starting to come to peace with the fact I'm genderqueer/transfemme (or something to that tune).

Im still presenting pretty masc, with feminine elements mixed in, but because of the gender stuff, I find myself having a very hard time interacting sexually with straight women, and im pretty steeped in the queer scene so i find that much more attractive intellectually than the straight dynamic.

Im also into men, but not as much as women, so my question mainly concerns queers &amp; women.

The core of my question is this: Are there any dating apps that focus on more queer dating? i find myself swiping left on 95% of tinder, and I feel Im far far far too masc right now to be venturing onto HER, is there anything else out there??

I just wish there was a miscellaneous lgbtq+ dating app that i could participate in, so i didnt need to filter through a huge amount of people who i know its not gonna be compatible. (is there an app like this??)

Also i dont mean to sound anti-straight or anything, just that my experience with cis straight women romantically often ends with me being forced into a masculine role, which i would like to avoid.

I‚Äôm trying to find out the difference between bottom dysphoria or if it‚Äôs less or something more. I identify as Asexual and female, it‚Äôs the time of the month where things usually trigger me, idk I get anxious and depressed more than usual and I think and think.
I‚Äôve always been in the mix of femininity and masculinity.

Questioning more into my Asexuality:
________________
I was thinking, maybe I‚Äôm asexual because I‚Äôm uncomfortable having sex? (( even though I‚Äôm not attracted to anyone but it can play a part, some aces are sex repulsed))
I‚Äôm not comfortable with my vagina, I feel depressed and sad almost- like I wanna rip my skin apart when I do have sex. Even simply pleasuring myself, after I‚Äôm done- I feel relief but at the same time I just get a crushing feeling. Like why? Almost shameful but not. 
________________

Body hair/my vagina:
I never shave down there, I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt know, I just don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt feel compelled to, even though most prefer ‚Äòshaved‚Äô when they have sex and that also occurs in my mind. If I shaved would I be more satisfied? But then I picture it bare and I feel no relief, in fact I feel more gross. I hate the way my genitalia looks to, why. Why can‚Äôt it just poof. If it was pretty would I be happy? Would I feel satisfaction? I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes I feel a itching feeling, like irritation. It hardly comes up, if I‚Äôm thinking about preforming sex, or getting undressed for someone. I wanna hide myself. I could careless about my boobs or any other part of my body. I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my vagina. I cry sometimes, wishing I was born with a dick. I would be out of place though wouldn‚Äôt I? Can‚Äôt have both words. Would sex be different for me if I had a penis? When I do have sex I feel like almost a phantom limb, I feel the action of preforming like a male but I can‚Äôt act on it? The idea of strap ons make me slightly less afraid of sex but still, it‚Äôs not the same.

Body:
Sometimes I look at my face and think I need a more defined jaw line, ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I‚Äôm fine with my boobs, but that‚Äôs because there small. If I had actual boobs- I feel like I‚Äôd cry. I‚Äôd die. I like my feminine body but sometimes I feel like I crave something more. 


Clothing;
I feel extremely hot and bomb af when I‚Äôm wearing masculine cloths. But who cares? I don‚Äôt base myself off of items or anything of the sort. I‚Äôm a perfect mix, even my hair. I feel fine in dresses, suit and tie. Even though I dress in the in between my whole life.

I first started questioning my gender 3 or so years ago. Two and a half years ago I came out to my boyfriend, he was incredibly supportive, accepting and took me 'mens' clothes shopping for the first time. I was only out to him. Then 45 got elected and I hid myself away again, my 'mens' clothes and binder just sat in my closet. Over the last year I restarted coming out and expressing my true NB self. Dressing more androgynously (except sundresses because I fucking love them lol) and asking my partner to use they/them (as well as using it in large anonymous or safe spaces, like cons or in this one class that was all about LGBT issues). I've recently been considering coming out to my sister (pretty sure she suspects it as she recently told me a story about a NB person she works with and I got the vibe she's was trying to say it's okay that I am nb). My partner knows all about my NB journey and how not out I am.

What just happened:
The other night my partner (cis amab) was out with a few of his friends while I was at work. One of them has a fairly new gf and she was asking questions and getting to know everyone better. She asked about me so my partner was talking about me. He was using she/her because that's how his friends know me (I've never met the new gf) but it felt wrong to him since he knows I prefer they/them so he told them ""sometimes [name] prefers they/them"" and continued talking about me using they/them.

I feel like he outed me. He apologized and I can tell he feels bad. But he also said he doesn't think they'll remember (it was late and they had been drinking) and that it was a subtle out. But I feel like saying that I'm a not a she is like a step away from saying I am trans. And I also really doubt his friends know anyone who uses they/them IRL so it could be pretty memorable. The friends that were there are pretty chill but some of his friend group is more conservative and nearly all his friends like making jokes to get a reaction out of people and I'm scared this is going to become one of those jokes.

Why are so many of these trans narratives so damn relatable?"" (Answers: yes, probably, and because some nonbinary people are also trans)

But I want to share something that might be helpful to other people starting their journey: dysphoria sucks, and while going down the rabbit hole of your past is kind of a necessary part of the process, it's extremely stressful and draining. 

But you know what's AMAZING? Gender euphoria. So I decided that I'm going to try to focus on what gives me that feeling, and let that be my guide. I started making a list of things that give me gender euphoria, as well as a list of things that I think might do so. I'm AFAB and really only now exploring my ""male"" side, so a lot of these are pretty masculine-coded:

**Things that give me male or non-binary gender euphoria:**

* Being referred to by ""they/them"" pronouns. (wowowowow, I did not expect this to feel so euphoric. I thought I didn't care about pronouns. I was wrong.)
* How my broad shoulders and small-ish boobs look in men's button-down shirts.
* Wearing this one button-down shirt that, due to the cut, makes me look flat-chested when I wear it. (THIS was a surprise)
* Man-spreading instead of sitting with my legs together (have only done this at home, not on the subway!)
* The fact that my speaking voice is low but my singing voice is a high soprano (very non-binary!)
* Connecting with other non-binary people, or binary trans people in early stages of transition, and feeling really connected to them.
* My big, blocky glasses

**Things I want to try:**

* Interested in binding, but going to start with a small sports bra
* Packing? (this seems scary but also really ... interesting)
* Wearing men's underwear
* Cutting my hair short (it's long and blonde and immediately marks me as a feminine woman)

Then I wanted to honor my female side, so I thought about **gender euphoria I've gotten from female things:**

* Female friendships, and feeling community with women, especially queer women
* Sometimes I love my girly hair
* Listening to good, feminine pop music, like Janelle Monae.

One of the cool things about exploring this way is that I've discovered I like things I never would have expected, like being referred to by certain pronouns, or how my shoulders look in a button-down. It's a really joyful and fun way to explore something that can be really heavy and scary.

I‚Äôve never come out as non-binary at work, but it‚Äôs an open secret that I‚Äôm some form of lgbt. I also have felt safe enough at this office that I feel like I can shut down conversations about trans people that are going in bad directions, and I‚Äôve called this specific coworker out before and he took it well. I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right time to be out at work, but I do feel like I now have an ally who I could go to if something horrible happened or I got outed on accident/maliciously.\n\nMy only wonder is how he figured out, but again, I‚Äôm ambiguously not straight, and I don‚Äôt directly lie about my gender often. Actually, I try very hard to avoid it, and I‚Äôm sure I make faces every time someone refers to me as my perceived gender....

The purpose of these updates is to provide  information as there is hardly any out there from people who have done  it since starting T, and this is a combo a lot of people, especially  nonbinary people, are interested in. Fin is a DHT blocker which is  responsible for a lot of changes we attribute to testosterone, but not  all.

Sorry I don't have a video. I am too self-conscious to do vid updates :S

Note  that I am also on Wellbutrin (have been for a while) which is known to  affect things like libido (though usually increases it, which I did not  find to be the case for me) as well as other potential things T/Fin  might have affected, so keep that in mind.

Some  background: I started T and Fin at the same time. I'm on 50mg of T  cypionate subq weekly and 1.25mg of Fin daily. I am 5'4"" and when I  started I was 120lbs, pretty petite and very ""cute"" in a way that has  people vastly underestimate my age. I am 30 and have never passed as  male no matter what my hair and clothes are. I have pretty wide hips for  my size and smallish chest, and I'm starting out here with a figure  that wont pass as male without some physical changes. My starting voice  was pretty high and pretty west coast and difficult to throw lower.

What I wanted from T: voice, muscles, change in body shape, and a better self image, more energy

What  I didn't want: body hair, facial hair, losing hair, bottom growth, high  sex drive, the supposed thicker feeling skin? That's kind of whatever  but I like my skin how it is. Being smelly. Acne.

Anyway  so with all that in mind here is what has happened over 9 months on  T+Fin. I started in 8/6/18. My latest T levels are in normal male range.

**Hair**

* No  significant change in body hair. The actual hairs haven't gotten  thicker/darker, nor has much more of it appeared. Possibly more on my  legs, though I usually shaved and now I haven't so I'm not entirely sure  how it compares to what it would have been before without shaving. But I  think it's a little more. Arm hair has not changed at all. There might  be a tiny bit more on my stomach but not enough that it looks  'masculine'.
* No facial hair at all.
* Head  hair has not changed. I dont notice much more of a masculine hairline,  but I also naturally already had a pretty masculine hairline.

**Voice**

My  speaking voice is lower, at an androgynous level. It's not so much  lower that people always comment about it or ask about it but it's  definitely a lot lower than it was. I don't think it sounds male exactly  but I think that has more to do with the quality than the depth and I  could probably work on it to make it sound more male. I don't think I'm  going to until I start visually passing more and have top surgery. I can  sing many notes lower than I could when I started, but I still can hit  most of the high notes I started with also which is unusual. I can still  sing in my head voice. It's possibly even improved in sound because  it's more resonant. Weird. I haven't had much cracking exactly, but for  several months it felt kind of uneven to talk. It's a little better now  though still sounds kind of funny sometimes. Somewhere in the middle of  my range, the transition between my headvoice and not when singing was  kind of sketchy depending on where I tried to switch. I assume my voice  is not done doing what it's gonna do.

**Body**

* I  have noticeably larger arm muscles and shoulder muscle/trapezius, calf  muscles. I don't work out though my job is slightly physical. I notice  new muscles occasionally I never noticed before. I can do 10 normal push  ups now while doing even 1 before was difficult. Yay. I should actually  lift some weights one of these days.
* I think there's been bottom growth but I don't think it would make someone look twice if someone were to see it.
* Period  is... annoying. Two months ago it was weird. Then it skipped a month  but I had cramps from hell that I've never experienced before. Then I  had it as normal the next time which made me pissed off. So T is  definitely affecting it, but it's not entirely getting the memo. My doc  things if i took a larger dose every other week, it would stop it. I  might switch to that and see how I feel about the high/low.
* As  for libido. I am ace and my libido has always been pretty minimal. At  this point its like. Mentally it feels kind of high especially for me,  but physically its still kind of eh! Like my interest is much higher but  my actual physical response isn't really that high. And if I'm doing  other things in the day I don't really think about it. It's really only  when I start getting bored.
* I  don't think I've had a dramatic change in my physique/fat distribution  yet which isn't that surprising given that I don't do any cardio. My arm  muscles have made several of my smallest shirts not fit anymore, like  at all. I still have a small waist. I've gained about 10 lbs so am now  around 128-130. I wear the same pants size--I assume its muscle weight  (or maybe water weight as they say). I don't think I look any heavier.
* Body  smell is not significant. If I wear my normal deoderant its a nonissue.  The smell of nether regions is like. I guess different? I'm not a fan  of it but its not nearly as bad as some people here describe.
* Acne  has been irritating. But I have struggled with it as an adult so much  that I had been on low dose accutane on and off for a while, and was for  the first month or two on T but then got off. THey're definitely  annoying but not horrific.
* No changes in hands or feet.
* Face  looks mostly the same, but the jaw has gotten more defined. The muscles  of my jaw are much easier to feel. But I still don't really pass lol.
* Skin feels the same.
* Energy  level is the same for the most part, although I find the physical  aspect of running to be much easier. Sadly I still get asthma attacks so  I dont do it.
* Appetite is the same.
* At  3 months I said: ""A lot warmer, sweat more easily, get cold less."" Well  either I got used to that as my new normal or it kind of went away  cause I feel like all that is basically the same as it always was again  now. Maybe still get cold a tiny bit less easily but meh.

**Mental:**

* I  haven't noticed any significant changes in how I feel mentally or  emotionally. I cry at the same level as before. Everything like that  feels the same.
* I think I'm a little sleepier.
* Slowly  getting more comfortable with idea of some of the things I didn't want  happening. But I don't know that I actually want them.

I don't pass. As far as I know my voice hasn't passed on the phone.

Hmm.... I can't really think of anything else.

608,2019-05-16 18:04:02,bpfur8,29,29,"Hi there all you lovely people. I have an honest question that's playing quite a lot into a powerful feeling for me. A little background: I'm a 29 year old amab, I wear dresses and skirts and makeup. I feel quite strongly drawn to identifying as a non binary person. It appeals to what I feel I am and how I want to present myself.

I feel a big part of what I find attractive about being nonbinary is that it could be a rejection of ""being a man"". That is, I have a huge problem with how ""men"" as a whole are, and act. I hate pervasive toxic masculinity. There's an awful lot about men, and being a man, that I dislike and want to distance myself from personally. In a sense I want to make a statement that I'm _choosing_ not to identify as that. That there are other ways to be.

I have a worry about that though, that it might be somehow offensive to other nonbinary people. I think that's based on a worry that for most people it's much more a positive statement of ""there's a thing called nonbinary which I am sure I am in my core"" rather than ""I choose to identify as nonbinary because I reject the binary genders, especially the one I was born presenting as"".

Can't dress femme. Not often. Formalities only. Feels wrong. Can I make it feel right?
Just need to embrace the femininity.

Woman. Ugh. No.
Yes, brain. Deal with it - woman. You've lasted this long after all, where did these thoughts even come from? On what grounds? You've got bigger fish to fry. Just quit this obsessing. That's all it is. Obsessing.
Just stop it. Picture telling people. Yeah, exactly. So shut up, brain. I'm not a fan either.
Non binary is for other people. You're cis. Even if you're not cis, non binary is for other people. Even if you're ftm, transitioning is for other people. People that actually care about that gender stuff. You don't really care. Not really. Not nearly enough, that's for sure.

I'm not agender go away. There's only 2 options in the real world. Choose or shut up, brain.

No, stop it. You know that other name idea is not a typical AFAB name.
Just a name. Go on. It's neutral. 
No, stop it, I'm just convincing myself out of nothing. Just stop. Nothing wrong with being cis.

652,2019-05-17 19:46:41,bpvsy9,2,3,"Hi everyone,

My background: 28 AMAB, hated masculine clothing etc when I was young, GID from teenage years. Lots of dysphoria in college, thought I was trans but saw a therapist and worked into realizing I would be better off just avoiding overtly masculine and feminine things and clothing in general and shooting for androgyny (hated wearing dresses also).  Generally happier since then, especially since I met my partner. However, still have kind of a persistent OCD about gender sans major emotional dysphoria.

My conflict: On one hand non binary describes my feelings in relationships with people intensely, as I don't feel a male/female duality and aggressively avoid it.  When I meet androgynous or even subtly not binary minded individuals I feel like I connect with them much better.  I kind of want to say ""I am non binary"" to have an upfront label for that feeling, and because I like that it creates an overt way for people who feel this way to communicate and assemble.

On the other hand, I don't feel the need to reject my sex.  If someone wanted to see me as an exemplar male person, I'd be happy with that, just like if someone thought of me as an exemplar New Yorker or an exemplar white person or whatever other identity is relevant.  It's just no more binary in nature than these other identities to me, and not associated with masc/femme feelings for sure.  I don't deny that having a male body hugely effects my life experience and I feel that rejecting that fact is just shirking responsibility.

I have some body dysphoria in the ""I want to be more androgynous and pretty"" direction but it's not much more than the average person has in any other direction at this point either, except for maybe 10% of the time it's pretty bad.

So, is non-binary an apt description, by your definition?

Background: my partner and I have been together for 15 years. Both AFAB, androgynous people who are queer identified and sort of immersed in lesbian culture, but express discomfort with being identified as ""lesbian"" or ""butch."" We are both also deeply uncomfortable in ""women's spaces,"" or with traditionally feminine things. Last summer, my partner came out as NB. It made sense, I was on board, everything was fine. Until they told me they were planning to have top surgery.

Cue meltdown.

More background: I full-on hate my body. Especially my breasts. I've been referring to them as ""bags of pain"" since I hit puberty. I am convinced they're just lying in wait to be cancer. I hate the way they look, and despite being somewhat uh... buxom, I wear S sports bras or bind (though binding causes other dysphoria for me).

My voice dysphoria is much improved, which was the goal of testosterone in the first place. But I also feel like I don't sound that different, and other people who know me say I don't sound that different. Which is true! Testosterone doesn't make you sound like a different person, it just puts your voice in a different place a little bit or something.

Being nonbinary the best I can hope for is strangers getting confused about my gender, like ""hello sir, I mean ma'am, I mean... er..."" or just half of people gendering me male and half gendering me female.

So since I'm bad at judging this stuff, I am not really sure what to do. Do I survey people on the street? I did the next best thing, and [asked Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/bq3q4d/almost_8_months_on_lowdose_testosterone_how_is_my/). :D And the verdict is... at the time of writing, two people say I sound male and one person says I sound androgynous-to-male.

I am honestly a little worried. I do NOT want to sound male. I'm pretty sure most people who see me think I'm a woman, and I thought it would be more obvious when testosterone was ""working"". I'm definitely in the grey area, but having people tell me I sound male is scary times. The last thing I want is to give myself dysphoria.

For the background, I'm AMAB NB. In the past I considered myself a trans girl but I kinda didn't feel totally one way or the other and, uh, that's why I'm nonbinary! Yay.

So as of late my dysphoria has been fairly tame? I used to dress femme in private pretty often to quell dysphoria but lately it hasn't been acting up all that much so now it's down to like, once a month sort of a thing. Like, I used to shave my legs every couple weeks but I haven't done so in a couple months. I feel actually moderately comfortable with how I am right now. (And my wallet is also happy I'm not trying to build a second wardrobe on the side.)

In the past I had sort of written off getting hormones bc of a lack of funds and insurance, so I kinda just accepted that if I were to get hormones, it would be in a few years after I get a different job and move and such, etc etc. 

And then a new route opened up for me. 

So I'm torn. 

On one hand, I definitely have, historically, wanted most of the changes that come from feminizing HRT. I'd like a feminine fat pattern and softer skin and thinner body hair and all that jazz.

But I'm not, like, horribly *unhappy* with how I am right at this exact moment. I feel tremendously lucky to come with a fairly androgynous body out of the box. My chest dysphoria only flares up every so often and honestly I'm more scared of somehow getting big bap than staying in the flat zone.

In queer spaces I already wear pronouns pins and introduce myself with my pronouns, but to cishet people I've been sort of spineless in this regard so far. I'm scared because I feel like it will hurt more to be misgendered if people are supposed to know better.

763,2019-05-21 01:00:25,br3xlw,8,4,"Just found this sub last week, sorry I‚Äôm late to the party!

I‚Äôve been out as nonbinary or bigender in some form or another for 14ish years. I‚Äôm finally in the position to have  top surgery next month. I decided on my look months ago (alone) with the surgeon. I went to the pre-op appointment with my wife last week and showed her the photo of what I was thinking of getting.

There was some whispered arguing between us in the office and that made me tell the surgeon that I needed to look at more images because I‚Äôm a bit confused. I‚Äôm sure that pissed the surgeon off‚Äî to change horses mid-stream, so to speak. Anyhow...

I was trying to, I don‚Äôt know, save face or something when my wife had an adverse reaction to the chest image I showed her. A few days later, she told me she cried in private over my decision because I apparently led her to believe I was choosing a smaller female chest instead of a male chest.. (I never really considered that there was a difference before?!? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and that she‚Äôs not attracted to male chests or really even small chests because she thinks of them as belonging to little girls instead.

I..... don‚Äôt know what to do with this information now.

She applauded the fact that I am finally aligning my outer image to the inner image I have of myself so she‚Äôs okay with the surgery itself and my need for it. So that‚Äôs not the issue really.. just the appearance of that final result.

I am decidedly both genders because I am one extreme externally and the other extreme internally. I feel that I would have worse dysphoria if I were to fully transition‚Äî hence getting only top surgery to fix the worst of my dysphoria.

I‚Äôm in the position that I‚Äôd rather have a female chest albeit way smaller than a male if it helps keep that part of my relationship alive. There is no ‚Äúfinding someone else‚Äù for me. She‚Äôs my person and has been that way for a very long time.

So here‚Äôs where I need an ask... currently a DD, is it possible to get down to an A or small B and still present as male when I want to? I currently have a microfiber concealer crew binder from Underworks.. it cuts my dysphoria by like 25% or so most days. Does anyone have experiences similar to what I‚Äôm trying to do? How and where did you find model chests to show to your surgeon? I want to be able to no longer need to wear a bra and to look male or at least androgynous when wearing a binder instead of butch. It‚Äôs not how I see myself or ID as, frankly.

My surgery is June 12th so it‚Äôs a massive change needing to happen under a deadline. I‚Äôve looked at some niche porn sites for women with almost flat chests to try to find a compromise image. Wanting to see if there are other corners of the internet I‚Äôm not looking in.

Hey, I live in Northern Europe and I'm still questioning (Idk if I'm nb, a trans guy or just a butch lesbian), but I really want a binder because my chest makes me feel like shit most of the time.

I don't know a lot about binding, but I was thinking maybe someone who's done it could help me figure out what's best for me.

I'm relatively tall (5'8"") and skinny and my chest is probably a C or a B cup, so not too big. The summer is gonna be warm and I tend to sweat a lot, which I'm afraid might make binding hell. I usually wear sports bras to work and they make my chest less prominent, but not flat, and I'd like to be flat.

I've been considering getting a binder from Dana√´, since they're based in the Netherlands, but I can't decide whether I should get their sports binder or their regular short binder.

My main concern with the sports binder is that it won't make me flat.

My main concern with the short binder is that I'll sweat too much and my breathing will be restricted (although I don't tend to wear it whan I'm at home, so I can restrict myself to 8 hours a day).

Idk which one would be healthiest to wear, the sports binder or the short binder, but it's important to me that I don't damage my spine, lungs, whatever else may be at risk when binding.

The sports binder is here: https://www.trans-missie.com/en/sport-binder-budget.html

The short binder is here: https://www.trans-missie.com/en/basic-binder-budget.html

I've also been considering getting a spectrum binder: https://spectrumoutfitters.co.uk/products/black-short-binder?variant=15857211506731

On how comfortable they feel using neutral pronouns for someone (V = Very; S = Somewhat): Gen Z - 32% V/25% S; Millennials - 31% V/28% S; Gen X - 25% V/24% S; Boomer - 24% V/26% S; Silent Gen - 18% V/21% S.

I'm turning 16 in a little over a month, which is still kind of mind boggling. I didn't really think that I'd make it this far in all honesty. I first realized I might be trans when I was like 12, maybe 13. I told myself then that I'd come out when I was 16. It just seemed so far away and almost impossible. 

I was scared and I worried that it was a phase or that I was faking because my dysphoria wasn't as severe/the same as other trans people I knew. Keep in mind this was roughly 2015-2016 when those helicopter gender memes were pretty big. I became more certain that I didn't feel like a girl but it felt like everything around me was seeing that as a joke. I kept seeing cis people, and worse, trans people, online saying that afab people my age were faking being trans for attention.

I kind of internalized that, I guess, because even though every person whose told me they're trans or nonbinary is valid to me I still feel like a fraud. I still worry that when (if) I come out, someone will tell me I'm wrong, or worse, I'll realize it was just a phase. I came to the conclusion a while ago that I'm not happy as a girl, but if I have to, I guess I can survive as one. 

It's weird, because I know logically that not many will reject me. I'm a GSA vice president at school, I'm out to my parents as pansexual, I'm in an LGBTQ youth chorus, most of my friends are LGBT. Despite this I'm still terrified of telling anyone more than the 2 people who know now (my best friend and my nb girlfriend).

This is getting long, I'll try to get to the point.

This could also just be imposter syndrome about being NB.

Or feeling like a fake NB with a chance of turning out as a girl.

So I took testosterone (low dose) for a while, and about a week ago I stopped because my voice is at an androgynous pitch and I don't want it to get more masculine.

Taking testosterone was really good for my genital dysphoria too! But I hear from my friend, who is a trans woman, that starting oestrogen makes your dick smaller and less likely to get erections and when you do get erections you're less hard. The endocrinologist told me that genital changes are permanent, but I feel like if trans women experience genital changes on oestrogen then he is not giving me the full story, you know?

Testosterone was so good for me, and I'm nervous that modern medicine only really knows about people who start testosterone and then *don't stop*. What if my endocrinologist just didn't have enough information and couldn't warn me? My catastrophising brain is worried that since having a clitoris was so bad for me (ugh I can barely type that I had a clitoris at all), if I stop T then I'll somehow end up with the worst of both worlds, worse than before I started T in the first place.

At some point I lost count, and I was proud of that for some reason. I felt that it was some sort of amusing noteworthy achievement to get read as a guy.

I'm like 75% sure I'm a binary trans guy. Idk it's only been a few months since I seriously started thinking about this.

What this means practically is that I am out to 1 person as a guy, and ask him to use he/him in private and she/her in public. There's 1 other person who has been along this journey with me, and I haven't necessarily come out to him with a label, but I have asked him to use they/them and she/her pronouns for me in public but in private if he slips in a he/him that would be cool. When people ask my pronouns, I mostly give she/her but if I feel safe say she/they.

I'm out as queer, ace, and/or bi to most people. I also feel like it's pretty obvious that I bind, and might be obvious that I pack sometimes. I go by an androgynous version of my birthname.

I have always been very feminine and have identified strongly with androgyny. Over the past year this has evolved for me into feelings of wanting to transition towards a more androgynous or non-binary physicality, to prevent further masculinization associated with aging.

However - I had gyncomastia surgery when I was 15, which is the equivalent to top surgery for a FtM individual, or a double mastectomy. As I identify more with androgyny than I do with traditional womanhood, I feel breasts or nipple enlargement would be an unwanted side effect for me of HRT.

Due to my situation I can't get a professional's opinion at the moment, so I'd appreciate if you guys could help me out by giving me an idea of if I do or not üíõ.

Whenever I hear dysphoria mentioned, I always hear of it as something super horrible and crippling. I don't know if it's just because I don't want to go from one side of the spectrum to another so it's less severe, or if that means I'm just feeling uncomfortable with my body in the normal, cis way.

The main problems I have are with my chest and hips. Some days I'm fine with them, but there are a lot of days that I look in the mirror and something's wrong. No matter what I do, they look wrong and nothing I do can fix them. I'm almost obsessed with their shape, size, etc. etc. etc.. I feel like I'd be happier if they were flat, but the days that I'm okay with them throw me off... And the fact that I'm not like, extremely upset about them.

My hair is another thing I have a problem with. I'm actually getting to shave my head this summer, but there are a lot of days that I'm frantic to do it. I get irrationally upset and irritated with it. Again, some days it's fine, and it's never *awful* or anything.

-----

I'm by far and away the furthest thing from an expert on the subject, I've only been out and experimenting with my gender for the past year. But I do have some thoughts that I'd like to put out there for anyone who lives in accordance with a binary existence and have difficulty understanding or empathizing with those who don't.

First and foremost, I'd like to share a quote from the Dark Mother herself:
""If you still want to insist on strictly binary sexual categories, then you're trying to force reality to fit your preconceived conceptual scheme instead of adapting your concepts to fit reality. And that is what bad science looks like.""
What is Gender? - ContraPoints

In my previous post, I was asked a question by a little kid at work: are you a boy or a girl?

The quickest and easiest way I could answer the question was by responding, I am both. But that's not capturing the full truth, it's a lie by omission and defining my gender as ""both male and female"" could be taken as a passive and yet harmful conformity to the gender binary, to which I myself do not live by, and which many nonbinary people are working to dismantle.

What I mean by that is, there are so many unnecessarily gendered things that reinforce the binary. Pink for girls, blue for boys, ""girls clothes"" vs ""boys clothes"", gendered bath products, children's toys, sports and which ones boys can play vs girls, the list goes on. Just go to the store and count how many products are labelled ""for men"" when they shouldn't be and you'll start to see what I mean.

I think another reason this might be is because of a common definition and understanding for what it means to be a man, and how most men are desperately seeking ways to reinforce their masculinity so as to not seem ""gay"" or feminine. But that's a topic for another time.

What I really want to talk about is defining gender, more specifically what my gender means to me. The problem is, when you begin to define things, you stick them in a rigid box and it becomes unadaptable, one definition for a single word won't fit everyone's existence.

So what IS gender? Gender is... Whatever you want it to be, based on your own understanding and how you want to define it for yourself. It's as simple as that.

I realize not many people like that explanation. They want hard answers, answers that most nonbinary people can't really give because we live so ambiguously and our definitions are going to vary person to person.

The thing to take away from this is, no one really owes anyone an answer. It's probably for the best to stop expecting one because of how rapidly society changes and chooses to define things, define what is masculine or feminine or anything else for that matter.

Our brains like binary systems instead of spectrums because they're rigid and easy to define. People want to see black and white, not shades of gray. Hence why my androgynous presence is confusing to kids because they can't easily read me as male or female, which they are growing up to believe is the only way a human can exist.

Why are we even trying to push arbitrary definitions on people's behaviors and personal styles? Why am I read as a female for painting my nails, or a male for the way I act and speak? We're all indoctrinated into the binary at birth based on our sex organs, but psychologically speaking my brain is very much not ""male"" OR ""female"". I can't even say for certain if it is both, or neither. It's ambivalent at the most and I can't really pinpoint what it is or what it means.

What I can define though are ways that I personally DO subscribe to binary characteristics, and I choose to do so based on my presentation. Presentation is communication.
Some days, I wish to be read as strictly female, so I dress as such and by doing so it makes me feel pretty, delicate, captivating, and feminine.
When I choose to present as male, it makes me feel respected, strong, courageous, and masculine.
When I present androgynously, it makes me feel the most like myself - right in the middle, a perfect balance of my favourite attributes where I feel right at home in my body.

These feelings are not inherently female or male, and feelings shouldn't be gendered in the first place as feelings are abstract concepts. A boy can feel pretty, and a girl can feel courageous. What I'm trying to say is these are definitions I've gathered and made for myself, how I choose to present, and what my psyche needs to thrive for the day. Some days I just wanna be a soft flower and other days I feel like I need the power of a jacked gladiator ready for battle.

I notice myself still giving feminine and masculine attributes to things that others would probably criticize me for doing, but that's because I've defined these things for myself. Men, women, and nonbinary people can all feel like flowers or like an entire Roman army,  it's completely up to them on how they choose to define it. This is why defining gender is so difficult, it's completely up to the individual.

The easiest way I've discovered to define myself is by the things I am not. I am not female. I am not male. I've taken a liking to calling myself a Femboy, but that's still not completely encapsulating the full truth. I'm not really seeking to define it, because I personally like distinguishing who I am based on what I'm not. It leaves a whole lot more room for change and interpretation, which is way more fun anyways. I live for the confused look on people's faces when they're trying to clock me and can't figure out how to treat me or talk to me based on my gender.

Hashtag abolish gender roles and all that good shit. Treat everyone equally and with respect. The void will swallow us all in the end.

But I do have some thoughts that I\'d like to put out there for anyone who lives in accordance with a binary existence and have difficulty understanding or empathizing with those who don\'t.\n\nFirst and foremost, I\'d like to share a quote from the Dark Mother herself:\n""If you still want to insist on strictly binary sexual categories, then you\'re trying to force reality to fit your preconceived conceptual scheme instead of adapting your concepts to fit reality. And that is what bad science looks like.""\nWhat is Gender? - ContraPoints\n\nIn my previous post, I was asked a question by a little kid at work: are you a boy or a girl?\n\nThe quickest and easiest way I could answer the question was by responding, I am both. But that\'s not capturing the full truth, it\'s a lie by omission and defining my gender as ""both male and female"" could be taken as a passive and yet harmful conformity to the gender binary, to which I myself do not live by, and which many nonbinary people are working to dismantle.\n\nWhat I mean by that is, there are so many unnecessarily gendered things that reinforce the binary. Pink for girls, blue for boys, ""girls clothes"" vs ""boys clothes"", gendered bath products, children\'s toys, sports and which ones boys can play vs girls, the list goes on. Just go to the store and count how many products are labelled ""for men"" when they shouldn\'t be and you\'ll start to see what I mean.\n\nI think another reason this might be is because of a common definition and understanding for what it means to be a man, and how most men are desperately seeking ways to reinforce their masculinity so as to not seem ""gay"" or feminine. But that\'s a topic for another time.\n\nWhat I really want to talk about is defining gender, more specifically what my gender means to me. The problem is, when you begin to define things, you stick them in a rigid box and it becomes unadaptable, one definition for a single word won\'t fit everyone\'s existence.\n\nSo what IS gender? Gender is... Whatever you want it to be, based on your own understanding and how you want to define it for yourself. It\'s as simple as that.\n\nI realize not many people like that explanation. They want hard answers, answers that most nonbinary people can\'t really give because we live so ambiguously and our definitions are going to vary person to person.\n\nThe thing to take away from this is, no one really owes anyone an answer. It\'s probably for the best to stop expecting one because of how rapidly society changes and chooses to define things, define what is masculine or feminine or anything else for that matter.\n\nOur brains like binary systems instead of spectrums because they\'re rigid and easy to define. People want to see black and white, not shades of gray. Hence why my androgynous presence is confusing to kids because they can\'t easily read me as male or female, which they are growing up to believe is the only way a human can exist.\n\nWhy are we even trying to push arbitrary definitions on people\'s behaviors and personal styles? Why am I read as a female for painting my nails, or a male for the way I act and speak? We\'re all indoctrinated into the binary at birth based on our sex organs, but psychologically speaking my brain is very much not ""male"" OR ""female"". I can\'t even say for certain if it is both, or neither. It\'s ambivalent at the most and I can\'t really pinpoint what it is or what it means.\n\nWhat I can define though are ways that I personally DO subscribe to binary characteristics, and I choose to do so based on my presentation. Presentation is communication.\nSome days, I wish to be read as strictly female, so I dress as such and by doing so it makes me feel pretty, delicate, captivating, and feminine.\nWhen I choose to present as male, it makes me feel respected, strong, courageous, and masculine.\nWhen I present androgynously, it makes me feel the most like myself - right in the middle, a perfect balance of my favourite attributes where I feel right at home in my body.\n\nThese feelings are not inherently female or male, and feelings shouldn\'t be gendered in the first place as feelings are abstract concepts. A boy can feel pretty, and a girl can feel courageous. What I\'m trying to say is these are definitions I\'ve gathered and made for myself, how I choose to present, and what my psyche needs to thrive for the day. Some days I just wanna be a soft flower and other days I feel like I need the power of a jacked gladiator ready for battle.\n\nI notice myself still giving feminine and masculine attributes to things that others would probably criticize me for doing, but that\'s because I\'ve defined these things for myself. Men, women, and nonbinary people can all feel like flowers or like an entire Roman army,  it\'s completely up to them on how they choose to define it. This is why defining gender is so difficult, it\'s completely up to the individual.\n\nThe easiest way I\'ve discovered to define myself is by the things I am not. I am not female. I am not male. I\'ve taken a liking to calling myself a Femboy, but that\'s still not completely encapsulating the full truth. I\'m not really seeking to define it, because I personally like distinguishing who I am based on what I\'m not. It leaves a whole lot more room for change and interpretation, which is way more fun anyways. I live for the confused look on people\'s faces when they\'re trying to clock me and can\'t figure out how to treat me or talk to me based on my gender.\n\nHashtag abolish gender roles and all that good shit. Treat everyone equally and with respect. The void will swallow us all in the end.

So I made an audio recording of my female voice using my phone and was hoping I could get some feedback. Having been born with male physiology makes it kind of difficult to talk like a girl, especially since I‚Äôve only been questioning for a couple of years and working on my voice for a short few months. 

The clip is about two minutes long so I think it gives a pretty good depiction of what it‚Äôs like after working on it for a little. 

If you have any tips or constructive criticism I would really like to hear it. Thanks so much.

This post talks about breast problems. I don't know if this is a sensitive topic for anyone, but this is a heads up just in case. 

Agender, AFAB.  I'm sorry if this is a little long winded. It's been something that has bothered and worried me a lot for several years, and I don't know what to do about it. 

 When puberty hit, I detested what was happening to my body. One of the worst parts was having my breasts grow in. At the same time, my weight exploded, and I gained at least 100lbs within a few months. To make matters worse, even if my weight had been under control, given my genetics, I would probably have had large breasts anyway.  My mom constantly picked on me for their size, and at the same time, she was incapable of understanding that mine were larger than hers were at that age.  Because of this, she forced me to wear bras that were several sizes too small, even as it was obvious that my chest was only getting larger.  At first it wasn't too bad, but as time went on, it hurt more and more, especially on the sides of my breasts, and I had trouble breathing.  I stopped going outside, because I was allowed to go without a bra in the house, unless she got a bee in her bonnet about how big they were, and I would wear one for as long as I could stand, then take it off again.  It was a couple of years before I was allowed to look for ones that were a different size, and then they all hurt.

At one point, I even went to a custom bra fitter, who measured me, and had me try things on, but said that the sides of my breasts were too sensitive for any bras that she knew of, and to just keep wearing the sleeping bras and hope for the best.

Now, about ten years later, _any_ bra still hurts, and it feels like my breathing is being constricted. I have trouble exercising in even a lightweight spandex sleeping bra.  I get dizzy and out of breath faster than I would if I didn't wear one at all. But, if I go without a bra, my chest is large enough that it is _very_ noticeable, and some people treat me like trash if they see it (I've already had earfuls from some family members, and others tried to quietly get me to change habits). Because of this, I usually still go out in one, even though it hurts and makes it harder to breathe.

Much of my body dysphoria centers around my chest, and the idea of wearing a binder sounds like a good solution, but I worry that if I can't wear a bra, I'm probably not going to be able to wear that either.  The closest thing to a binder that I have, is a very lightweight spandex tank top, which just sort of holds the breasts down a tiny bit. It doesn't really make my chest look flat, and the outline of my chest is still very obvious, so people can very clearly see that I'm not wearing a bra. It only helps a tiny bit, but it's more comfortable than a bra, and I can breathe better.


The end result is, the sides of my breasts nearest my armpits are exceedingly easy to bruise, and become sore even if I wear a sleeping bra. Any bra feels like it is constricting my breathing, including ones that professional bra fitters say should fit. I HATE wearing bras anyway because they make the breasts stick out more. I want a flat chest, but I don't think that I can wear a binder, mostly due to constricted breathing. I can deal with breast pain, since I've had it for so long, but I need air to function. This is becoming more of an issue now, because I'm trying to exercise (partly due to other health problems) and lose some of the weight again, mostly to see if they can at least get a bit smaller.  I don't mind the feeling of exercising without a bra, but I do mind seeing my chest bounce when I do, and I dislike how poorly I am treated by some other people for doing so, when they notice.  

Yes, I have talked to a doctor about it in the past and was ignored and basically told that it was all in my head, which just made me second guess everything, hate myself more, and double down on ignoring the pain.  Even now I don't know if it is all in my head, but I know how much it hurts how I feel about myself, and I'm trying to at least improve on that.  

Does anyone have any advice on what I might be able to wear?",NonBinary,"I don't think that I can wear a binder, and need advice.",1559262776.0,"{'created_utc': 1559237576, 'id': 'buw0pd', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 5, 'selftext': ""\nThis post talks about breast problems. I don't know if this is a sensitive topic for anyone, but this is a heads up just in case. \n\nAgender, AFAB.  I'm sorry if this is a little long winded. It's been something that has bothered and worried me a lot for several years, and I don't know what to do about it. \n\n When puberty hit, I detested what was happening to my body. One of the worst parts was having my breasts grow in. At the same time, my weight exploded, and I gained at least 100lbs within a few months. To make matters worse, even if my weight had been under control, given my genetics, I would probably have had large breasts anyway.  My mom constantly picked on me for their size, and at the same time, she was incapable of understanding that mine were larger than hers were at that age.  Because of this, she forced me to wear bras that were several sizes too small, even as it was obvious that my chest was only getting larger.  At first it wasn't too bad, but as time went on, it hurt more and more, especially on the sides of my breasts, and I had trouble breathing.  I stopped going outside, because I was allowed to go without a bra in the house, unless she got a bee in her bonnet about how big they were, and I would wear one for as long as I could stand, then take it off again.  It was a couple of years before I was allowed to look for ones that were a different size, and then they all hurt.\n\nAt one point, I even went to a custom bra fitter, who measured me, and had me try things on, but said that the sides of my breasts were too sensitive for any bras that she knew of, and to just keep wearing the sleeping bras and hope for the best.\n\nNow, about ten years later, _any_ bra still hurts, and it feels like my breathing is being constricted. I have trouble exercising in even a lightweight spandex sleeping bra.  I get dizzy and out of breath faster than I would if I didn't wear one at all. But, if I go without a bra, my chest is large enough that it is _very_ noticeable, and some people treat me like trash if they see it (I've already had earfuls from some family members, and others tried to quietly get me to change habits). Because of this, I usually still go out in one, even though it hurts and makes it harder to breathe.\n\nMuch of my body dysphoria centers around my chest, and the idea of wearing a binder sounds like a good solution, but I worry that if I can't wear a bra, I'm probably not going to be able to wear that either.  The closest thing to a binder that I have, is a very lightweight spandex tank top, which just sort of holds the breasts down a tiny bit. It doesn't really make my chest look flat, and the outline of my chest is still very obvious, so people can very clearly see that I'm not wearing a bra. It only helps a tiny bit, but it's more comfortable than a bra, and I can breathe better.\n\n\nThe end result is, the sides of my breasts nearest my armpits are exceedingly easy to bruise, and become sore even if I wear a sleeping bra.

Im AFAB, and generally speaking I'm totally okay being identified as a girl. I still use she/her, and I am more than happy with my chest.

5,2019-05-01 03:56:48,bjcv5e,9,8,"I personally grew up on porn.  I am 20 now, and have been regularly consuming porn since the age of probably 8-9.  I found fetish porn shortly thereafter and by around 12(complete guess) I was totally hooked on what they call ‚Äúsissy porn‚Äù.  After dealing with that for a long, long time I started to realize that I felt something much deeper and more significant than just arousal.  As of fairly recently I‚Äôve begun to question my actual gender identity and explore its fluidity.  As in: in real life not just sexually.  

However, I‚Äôve never really ‚Äústopped‚Äù finding sissy fetishism ‚Äòhot‚Äô.  I do realize that there have been great arguments made against the fetish, and it‚Äôs ability to dehumanize and objectify femininity as a concept.  Yet, I‚Äôm not so sure I agree that is universally true.  And yes, I do like to be objectified and degraded‚Äî but that is entirely unrelated to my gender identity.  This fetishism and gender dysmorphia are only correlated for me in so far as sissy fetishism helped me to self examine and reflect upon my real gender and explore feelings which I may have otherwise repressed for longer.  But, this aforementioned correlation does NOT equal causation.  

My gender identity wasn‚Äôt made by this pornography, nor are they necessarily and contingently linked in any way.  Further, I am entirely capable of recognizing the vast differences between real womanhood as I want to present it and the womanhood shown in sissy porn.  


So, with the biographical ramblings out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about r/TGandSissyRecovery..

This sub likens itself to r/NoFap and claims to be a community that helps people out of their addictions.  Sounds good so far right?  The issue is that the ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù they‚Äôre trying to cure, at least in practice, sounds an awful-lot like gender dysmorphia.  You can‚Äôt be addicted to gender dysmorphia.  

If you can‚Äôt stop thinking about being a woman and your birth-assigned gender is making you uncomfortable regularly, those aren‚Äôt withdrawals symptoms! Yet they treat them as such, urging people to repress these feelings as much as they can and throw away any girl clothes or makeup they own. 

I used to be a porn addict.  I am managing through recovery with the help of my wonderful girlfriend, and ironically r/NoFap , but that didn‚Äôt take away my feelings towards sissy-play nor my gender identity.  At least not any more‚Äî I have gone through many cycles of questioning the validity of my possible transness.  In fact, some of these purges stemmed from my being on r/TGandSissyRecovery where i read that the feelings I was having about my gender ‚Äòwere actually a part of a conspiracy to get cis men to become addicted to this type of porn.‚Äô (I‚Äôm paraphrasing here) 



I guess what I‚Äôm curious to hear is:

A: Do you think sissy fetishism is NECESSARILY evil or harmful to femininity? (Keyword being necessarily) 

And 

B: Is what r/TGandSissyRecovery does more, less or equally as harmful to the people who are exploring their gender identities‚Äî albeit through less than ideal means?

I found fetish porn shortly thereafter and by around 12(complete guess) I was totally hooked on what they call ‚Äúsissy porn‚Äù.  After dealing with that for a long, long time I started to realize that I felt something much deeper and more significant than just arousal.  As of fairly recently I‚Äôve begun to question my actual gender identity and explore its fluidity.  As in: in real life not just sexually.  \n\nHowever, I‚Äôve never really ‚Äústopped‚Äù finding sissy fetishism ‚Äòhot‚Äô.  I do realize that there have been great arguments made against the fetish, and it‚Äôs ability to dehumanize and objectify femininity as a concept.  Yet, I‚Äôm not so sure I agree that is universally true.  And yes, I do like to be objectified and degraded‚Äî but that is entirely unrelated to my gender identity.  This fetishism and gender dysmorphia are only correlated for me in so far as sissy fetishism helped me to self examine and reflect upon my real gender and explore feelings which I may have otherwise repressed for longer.  But, this aforementioned correlation does NOT equal causation.  \n\nMy gender identity wasn‚Äôt made by this pornography, nor are they necessarily and contingently linked in any way.  Further, I am entirely capable of recognizing the vast differences between real womanhood as I want to present it and the womanhood shown in sissy porn.  \n\n\nSo, with the biographical ramblings out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about r/TGandSissyRecovery..\n\nThis sub likens itself to r/NoFap and claims to be a community that helps people out of their addictions.  Sounds good so far right?  The issue is that the ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù they‚Äôre trying to cure, at least in practice, sounds an awful-lot like gender dysmorphia.  You can‚Äôt be addicted to gender dysmorphia.  \n\nIf you can‚Äôt stop thinking about being a woman and your birth-assigned gender is making you uncomfortable regularly, those aren‚Äôt withdrawals symptoms! Yet they treat them as such, urging people to repress these feelings as much as they can and throw away any girl clothes or makeup they own. \n\nI used to be a porn addict.  I am managing through recovery with the help of my wonderful girlfriend, and ironically r/NoFap , but that didn‚Äôt take away my feelings towards sissy-play nor my gender identity.  At least not any more‚Äî I have gone through many cycles of questioning the validity of my possible transness.  In fact, some of these purges stemmed from my being on r/TGandSissyRecovery where i read that the feelings I was having about my gender ‚Äòwere actually a part of a conspiracy to get cis men to become addicted to this type of porn.‚Äô (I‚Äôm paraphrasing here) \n\n\n\nI guess what I‚Äôm curious to hear is:\n\nA: Do you think sissy fetishism is NECESSARILY evil or harmful to femininity? (Keyword being necessarily) \n\nAnd \n\nB: Is what r/TGandSissyRecovery does more, less or equally as harmful to the people who are exploring their gender identities‚Äî albeit through less than ideal means?\n\n\nP.S.

I know this might sound offensive. I don‚Äôt know. I have never felt like this before. So I have no idea how transsexuality works. How you are supposed to feel. But lately I‚Äôve felt like I might be leaning towards transsexuality or just plain confusion.

I have and have always had extreme body dysmorphia. More so in the last 2 years than before. I am very skinny and have always been underweight (up until lately. I have a new dietitian and have finally reached a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù minimum bmi, yay. But im still very frail-looking). Shortly, I‚Äôve never felt home in my body. I‚Äôve never felt like a woman. But lately I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs just because of my frailness. I was at prom and I didn‚Äôt feel like buying dresses. I didn‚Äôt put 2 and 2 together up until now that I‚Äôm writing this. I thought it was because of my body. I always thought dresses didn‚Äôt look good on kind of uh ‚Äústick‚Äù-bodies like mine. I was dreading trying them on. My mom basically helped me pick one. I picked her favourite because she seemed so happy about it. My friend‚Äôs mother said I had gained a lot of ‚Äúshape‚Äù and that in the dress I didn‚Äôt look like a stick at all.

When talking to my psych and I showed her pictures, she noticed that I wasnt content. I had spent hours on my make-up. Even gotten my hair done. She asked me what was wrong, why, why I didn‚Äôt like the photos. I couldn‚Äôt give her a clear answer. I said ‚ÄúI still look like a stick, kind of‚Äù. She said it‚Äôs not true, and once again asked why. I said I didn‚Äôt feel like I got the dress, the hair and preperation that I had invisioned. It didn‚Äôt click. It never did. Not even when it all came together.

I‚Äôve always looked at women or girls my age with hips and an ass and just -shape-, and admired them. I still feel like I want to be like them but I don‚Äôt know how to explain my desire to also... be male?

I write a lot. And I write a lot about the same male character. I don‚Äôt feel like sharing much about him because in a way it feels he is ‚Äúmine‚Äù...? Like he is apart of me. It makes me sick. He‚Äôs in the back of my mind when I‚Äôm shopping for clothes, when I am talking to people. I have such an admiration for guys I can‚Äôt put it to words. I want to be like them. When I see a group of guys walking through the mall I have this sickening desire to either be with one or be one of them.

Which brings me to my next point. I am bisexual, however I‚Äôve always felt more attracted to males. When I have fantasies, they are about two males. Which isn‚Äôt strange, I feel. Girls my age ship guys all the time. That‚Äôs where it started. But I realize lately it‚Äôs been a bit more than should be? I mean, surely those girls don‚Äôt somehow ‚Äúput‚Äù themselves in the situation.

I don‚Äôt know what to do with this. I feel hopeless. I feel late. Late with realizing. I also feel like I‚Äôm making it sound worse than it is. don‚Äôt feel like making hastily decisions. Immediately deciding this means I am trans and making decisions I will regret. Like I said, maybe this might also be confusion from never feeling like a woman because of my frail body?

Different pronouns and names feel gross and artificial and everything feels overwhelming, intense and wrong? 

1. The closest people in your life are the ones who you should start with readjusting, not strangers. 
This is the hardest part of pretty much the entire thing. I feel gross to just call myself something else and a different name, especially to my family or close friends. They knew me for so long and now all of a sudden are supposed to call me something else. How can that be acceptable in any way. Am I not just a gross giant men in a dress if I do that. Am I not just playing a persona like a theatre act? Well this is exactly how I felt when I used different pronouns or a different name with strangers without my closest people using it. How did I realise I have to start with my loved ones. After a shit tone of live or die mental breakdowns and crying at friends places for hours and hours repetitively and consistently trying to scream out some sense out of life on which way to go. Reminding myself that I'm literally just another human trashbag being like everyone else on this planet can be pretty exhausting when you start to call yourself a different name. Remind yourself of why you are doing this with all the power the mental torture of transition hasn't knocked out of head. Remind yourself of the beautiful things that will happen in the future once that artificial feeling is over and you feel 100% like yourself again. 

2. Self- acceptance is the absolute hardest part of transition

I know what Im talking about when I say that accepting that you are allowed to live as the different gender is the fucking worst intense part of it all. Going through an Eating Disorder myself and trying to make myself as physically small as possible has taught me that accepting yourself really is a fulltime wall to wall shitshow and easier said than done. It's the reason people decide to transition at 65 when their life is almost over. (or kill themselves during any part of the process). It's a battle within yourself that no-one sees because realistically no-one except you really fucking gives a toss. Is there anyone in your surrounding that can relate to not being able to ""just be your gender""? No? Great, cause then they won't fucking understand what it's like to hate and love yourself for transitioning anyways. They literally just want the best for you and this is when shit's getting really gaggy cause that's when you realise the battle has been within yourself the entire time. Drop it all and allow yourself to be called the other gender. Be nice to people, cause people find it difficult to talk shit about nice people, despite your appearance.

3. Not being able to concentrate on anything else and feeling shit the entire time. 

Within a relatively short period of time you literally adjust to changes that have influence over your entire life until you are dead. Aha moment!  this is why it feels like you're carrying a 50kg bag of existential crisis thoughts and psycadelic drug like emotions around you at all times. Because essentially what you are doing while transitioning is questioning your entire existence. Acknowledge the fact that what you are doing is fucking massive. It's huge. You're fucking insane and you can be so proud of yourself. Acknowledge that, without any judgement, people that are not of this experience have it easier and don't have to completely open up the depths of their psyche. But you know what, you will always have a perspective on life that no-one else has and in a way you can look a little bit further into the insanity of life than your average human being, AGAIN without any judgement or feelings of superiority. If anything, If you allow yourself to think too much about it, the trans experience makes you feel incredibly alienated, lonely and inferior. As traumatized as you may be now, you will find out that everyones value is the same, you are normal like everyone else and even if the people you love will never fully understand the crazy depths of it, acknowledge that they show compassion and support, the same way you would show them compassion and support. Acknowledge that it's okay that this massive gap you opened up within space, that makes life so fragile and raw may be visible for you but not for the majority of your family and friends.

Every single day, as I browse trans-Reddit, I see the memes over and over again. TERFS suck. TERFS should shut the fuck up. TERFS should die. This is mostly in r/traaaaaaaaaaaaaans and r/transgendercirclejerk, but this post doesn't really fit the standards of either of those subreddits, and I'm assuming there's a fair overlap between this sub and those, so I'm posting here. And, I gotta say, the TERF-bashing has gotten old.

Look, I get the need for venting and catharsis. But I think the obsession we as a community have with the people who hate and fear us is more than a little unhealthy. Do the opinions of people who don't know or understand you and who operate in bad faith really matter all that much that multiple people have to publicly gripe about it *every - single - day*? 

This is part of a broader trend I see within the trans community - this overwhelming focus on the negative. Like that 'Guess I'll die' meme - what the fuck is that? Why do we have a commonly circulated meme about giving up and dying? Why are we cool with this? I could see if it was funny, but it's not. Now that's not to say that there is no place for discussing the negative. The trans experience is rough. We all know this, and these places are perfectly fine for seeking solidarity, soliciting advice, and sometimes just getting some stuff off your chest. This is what they're here for. 

But who, pray tell, do all these 'TERFS SUCK!' posts service? Us? We already know. Is it a slap in the face to TERFS? No. Why would they even be on here to see them? You're preaching to the choir. And frankly, it's a sermon that's long gone stale.

The only reason I can conceive for it is that it makes you feel good, feel vindicated to snark about how stupid/hypocritical/awful TERFs are and get a chorus of upvotes for it. Which, fine, I guess, if that's what floats your boat. But, I would submit, maybe you'd find that even more gratifying than focusing so much on the people who hate you and how much you hate them would be focusing on the people who love and care about you. Even if you don't have anyone like that in your meatspace, they're out there. There are tons of supportive allies for the trans community. Where are the memes praising them? I see a few, you know, every now and again. Not nearly as many as the TERF-bashes though. Not a tenth as many.

And maybe, just maybe, instead of vomiting out a constant stream of lazy, recycled memes espousing entirely uncontroversial (within the trans space, anyway) opinions, maybe we should instead be spending our time looking into ourselves and creating original, insightful content that meaningfully adds to the community. Write. Paint. Compose. Draw from your own pain and suffering and make something beautiful from it. Something that will improve the day of people going through their own struggles, and hopefully inspire them to do the same.

Additionally, I am talked down to, looked at as female, treated as female, and considered disabled despite recovering physically.

173,2019-05-05 19:24:52,bl1usc,0,2,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm a 26 year old male who has been confused about who he is for a very long time. My first sexual experience was with my best friend growing up. We would give each other oral and jerk off together, never any penetration. I remember our moms caught us and we would say whatever we could to get out of being in trouble because two young boys shouldn‚Äôt be behaving in that manner (eye roll). Anyway, we stopped all of that when my mother actually caught us in the act of him performing fellatio on me, causing me to run out of the house from shame and guilt. I was in 7th grade when that happened, and that was when we stopped being friends. 

I never had a conversation about it, only when my mother frantically asked me if I was gay and I responded no of course not. In my head I believed it too. Some part me of still doesn‚Äôt know what to think. I‚Äôve always been attracted to woman, making love to them, and always had multiple girlfriends. I also would secretly watch trans porn as a teen and knew that something about these woman really attracted me. 

I end up getting addicted to drugs because honestly all of my self confusion would cause me to lash out in different aspects of my life. So I started partying and being the ‚Äúcool kid‚Äù and what not. Eventually try heroin and open up an entirely new can of worms to deal with. 

While I was in addiction I was taken advantage of by someone at a program I was going to. He would give me money, knowing that I was getting high with it. I was naive about the entire situation. One night he invites me over and says let‚Äôs have a few beers and I‚Äôll give you the money you asked for. Wanting to use, I agreed, and then was shocked when he grabbed my cock after we walked into his apartment. I pushed him off of me (first gay experience since I was a kid) and asked him what the fuck he was doing. We talk and finally he explains how bad he wants to suck me, so I let it happen. What I wasn‚Äôt ready for was how much I was going to enjoy it. And it left me feeling uncertain about myself. 

Fast forward to another program when I‚Äôm trying to get off methadone and this older guy there started teaching me about the gay community. He told me he was an otter, and I learned all these different terms and that I was a cub lol. He gave me head and I stroked his cock, and again I felt more satiated than I ever have in my life. We only did that one time, and I actually had a girlfriend at the time. 

A girlfriend who I was with for the past four years after that program who has seen me overcome heroin addiction. As my mind started to clear, I remembered this time I met my first trans woman in Brooklyn, and I was so into her, but she didn‚Äôt want anything to do with an inexperienced 21 year old kid. I knew that I wanted to explore these feelings but I had no idea how to do so, especially still dealing with the uncertainty of who I am. 

I decided to explore trans woman working as escorts, simply because I had no idea where else to look. This allowed me to identify that I know what I want. And last night I went on my first REAL date with this amazing girl. She took me to my first gay club and we had such a great time. We danced all night, drank, smoked a little weed when we got back to her place and made love several times. 

It was raining before we got in my car, and I grabbed her and kissed her for the first time in the rain. As cheesy as it sounds, it was the most amazing kiss I‚Äôve ever had. Like fireworks went off. For once I understood what people mean when they say chemistry. 

I drove home in tears because this is the first time in my life I felt comfortable with who I am. Like I‚Äôm not living a lie. 

Thank you for reading this.

213,2019-05-06 20:51:26,blhi8v,1,1,"Hello r/trans! 

Sorry in advance for the really long post, feel free to skip down to the TLDR if you'd like/

I work in a reference diagnostics laboratory that receives patient samples from hundreds of hospitals all around the country. Hospitals draw blood and mail it to us to perform whatever testing they would like (as long as we offer it), we write up a report with the findings, and the doctor will use the report for diagnostic purposes.

In the type of testing the I run, we see the sex chromosomes of the patient sample (we will find either XX in females or XY in males, and possibly both if the patient had a bone marrow transplant). 

Since we see the sex chromosomes in our testing, sometimes it's very confusing and could look like a lab error/sample mix up occurred if the patient gender or sex provided doesn't match up with the sex chromosomes we see. 

Our lab sends a requisition form to all the hospitals we work with, which asks for all the necessary patient info (DOB, name, sex, diagnosis, tests to be ordered, etc...). Our requisition form doesn't include anywhere to indicate if a patient is transgender. 

Sometimes we will see a patient with a stereo-typically male name (ie ""Steven"") and our form only asks for gender, not sex (which is unfortunately used interchangeable in the healthcare industry). For the gender, they might put female. Once we process the patient sample, we may see male chromosomes. This would lead us to think we had a patient sample mix up, or the patient had a transplant. Before releasing the result of the test, we call the ordering physician to confirm if the patient had a transplant when there was a gender discrepancy. If the doctor says no transplant happened, we have no choice but to release the results as seen. 

Because of this gap, I feel like trans patients are at a disadvantage. There's no way for us as a lab to guarantee we didn't make a mistake when we don't have all the information. Often the doctor doesn't have any information is a patient is trans, either, because the medical records don't even offer it as an option. Sometimes the doctor will ask the patient and get back to us, but I feel like that could put the patient in an annoying spot to constantly have to answer questions that patient could have given an answer to in the first place if someone thought to ask.

**TLDR: When you go to the doctor and fill out patient demographic forms, would you like the option to provide both sex and gender? Would you like to have a ""M to F"" and ""F to M"" option? Do you have any other suggestions/preferences/feedback?**

I really want to bring this issue up to our CEO. Personally, if I put myself in the shoes of a trans person, I think I would feel excluded and confused about how to fill out patient forms. However, I can see how being open about being trans could cause some uncomfortable situations in a scenario in which you came across trans-phobic healthcare providers. I don't want to go off my assumptions alone, so I was curious to know what the trans community would like to see from the healthcare industry, first. 

Thank you so much for your help.

I asked the same question in r/NonBinary already, but r/trans doesn't allow crossposts, I hope this is okay - if not I will take it down :)  




Hi, I'm Feu!  
Non-binary, 21 years old, moved out into my own apartment about 4 years ago, working full time, trying very hard to adult my way through life.

I see my parents roughly every 2-3 weeks for a day or two. I don't really have the best relationship with my dad (we tend to fight a lot over nothing), but I absolutely adore my mother.  
She means the world to me and she is a super sweet lady and I really _really_ don't want her to feel bad because of me.

Despite being from a small and conservative village, my family is very accepting - they support me a lot in my transition.

They started calling me by my chosen name immediately after me asking them to (with a lot of slip-ups but they usually just correct themselves most of the time).  
My mum showed me that they had changed my name in their contacts to ""Chosen name (Birth name)"".

Which is making me feel a bit conflicted, I don't particularly hate my birth name - it's just super gendered. Which is also why I don't really want it associated with me...

She told me, that she doesn't want to make me feel guilty, but that she would like to express a feeling she's had ever since I told them my chosen name.  
(And I love this kind of communication - letting people know what you feel, with _them_ knowing that it's not meant to hurt them)  
So, she said that she feels sad about me sort of ""rejecting"" the name they picked for me.

How can I help them to not feel as bad about it?

I would also really love to hear from parents with trans kids - and how they felt, when their kid told them about having chosen a new name for themselves :)",trans,How can I help my parents deal with the fact that I am dropping the name they gave me?,1557202063.0,"{'created_utc': 1557176863, 'id': 'blhpmy', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'First off:  \nI asked the same question in r/NonBinary already, but r/trans doesn\'t allow crossposts, I hope this is okay - if not I will take it down :)  \n\n\n\n\nHi, I\'m Feu!  \nNon-binary, 21 years old, moved out into my own apartment about 4 years ago, working full time, trying very hard to adult my way through life.\n\nI see my parents roughly every 2-3 weeks for a day or two.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://deemac.bandcamp.com/album/eve-of-destruction](https://deemac.bandcamp.com/album/eve-of-destruction)

&amp;#x200B;

All parts written and performed by me, except for the horns - I composed the parts, then had others play them for me - and the backing vocals on Don't Cry for Me.  


Genre-wise, I'd define it as Acid Jazz, in a similar style to The Brand New Heavies, or early Jamiroquai, with plenty of classic soul and R&amp;B influences in there too. The songs draw from a variety of things, such as my separation from my emotionally manipulative ex, struggles with trying to have children, and of course, my own struggles with being transgender (albeit in a not overtly obvious way).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with my singing voice for a while now, and despite having everything finished except the vocals, since 2017, I've been unable to bring myself to release it. I've been able to develop a very comfortable feminine speaking voice, but singing is another story altogether. My degree was a bachelor of music, majoring in Jazz voice, whilst still in denial, and I'd always thought, seeing as I'm a trained singer, adjusting my voice should come easily for me, as I'm already familiar with most of the typical vocal feminising techniques. This was true for my speaking voice, but it turns out that changing your singing voice is significantly harder.   


I've been through a lot of stages with this album, recording the vocals over and over, trying my best to get them to sound femme. I tried plugins that would alter the timbre of my vocals, by shifting the formants, but they just made me sound robotic. For a long time, I even considered getting in another vocalist to perform the songs. Eventually I came to some kind of acceptance, that while I may one day be able to develop a more femme singing style, right now, this is how I sing, and I should own that, as I am a singer. My voice does still cause me dysphoria, but the other emotional benefits I get from singing FAR outweigh the negatives. While I'm singing, I feel free. It may hurt to listen back and hear a man, but in the moment, during the actual performance, gender stops mattering. 

&amp;#x200B;

From that, I've been trying to reframe my perspective. I may not have the voice I want to have, but it's still my voice, and I want it to be heard. It doesn't matter what it sounds like, it's still a womans voice, because it's my voice. And the songs are about FAR more than how I sound. At the end of the day, it's not about how masculine or feminine I sound, it's about the music.",trans,"Despite dysphoria over my singing voice, I'm releasing this Acid Jazz/Soul/R&amp;B album into the wild.",1557303227.0,"{'created_utc': 1557278027, 'id': 'blz0lt', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 8, 'selftext': ""TL;DR - I'm coming to terms with my singing voice still sounding male, and have decided to just release this album I've been sitting on for the last two years.

Translation of the video description:

Brazil, due to violence and hatred, the life expectancy of transgender people is only 35 years, half of the expectation of the CGE population. This data is brutal and is the message of the film produced for the LGBTQI + Athos news portal. Young &amp; Rubicam created the campaign and invited the producer FAUNA to develop this film because of their vision under the theme. Based on its methodology, FAUNA sought to set up a team with a speech place to tell this story. At the invitation of the producer, writer Luh Maza - one of the main trans writers in activity in Brazil - joined Uni Corr√™a - researcher - to develop together not only this plot, but its nuances. The verses of Forever Young's song Alphaville, which turns 35 in 2019, were interpreted in an unpublished version by the singer Liniker and became the soundtrack of a short film about the love starring Guto and Onika, a real couple and transcentrated.

I walk with confidence. I give the happiest smiles. I have clothes that I enjoy wearing. I feel best on sunny days. I style my hair in a way that apparently ‚Äúsuits me‚Äù. I have green eyes with the most delicate gold rings around my pupils that my friends find so captivating. I‚Äôve had naturally long eyelashes since birth.

I‚Äôm \*told\*.

I feel I look my best when I‚Äôve shaved my legs, gone to the hairdressers, used anti-acne and moisturizing creams like it‚Äôs my religion, whitened my teeth, had false nails applied, wore my favourite clothes without breaking any boundaries, and‚Ä¶ shaved my face.

They love taking me to Sephora to get a makeover. I love it too but not for the reasons they think. 

For years, my true soulmate, the sister I share an existence with, the girl I love but wish would go away, sneaks out of her quiet way of being to disrupt my life. I grant her the nighttime to control my dreams and disrupt my sleep when she‚Äôs most unhappy.

She dreams sweet dreams of being free from me. She hates me, I love her.

I want her to live her life in the light of day but that would mean my extinction. My friends and family would mourn my loss while she attempts to forget that I ever existed. Most of my family would curse her for murdering their son.

Incoming wall of text (grab a coffee). No tl;dr (sorry)

This is pretty long, but I wanted to write about my story, so others may find similarities and now they are not alone.

I am not a native spreaker, so please excuse some weird sentences and mistakes :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Here we go**

I was born at the beginning of the 80‚Äòs and had a pretty good and caring childhood. I never had any attempts to wear dresses or played with dolls (they creep me out). Albeit I played extensively with my stuffed animals and never liked roughhousing or the like. I was a tame and uncomplicated child. I had rarely forced gendered behaviour onto me, just the occassional big boys don‚Äòt cry, etc.

My friends were mostly girls and I got along better with them, than with the boys.

Sometime around when puberty hit me, I became endulged with the female body and female clothing. I made myself sexy underwear that really aroused me to wear, as I was aroused by the catalogue models (back then, we had no internet).

I liked to wear this underwear and when I was around 15 I bought my first set of female clothing and hid it around the house. My luck with the ladies, was alomst non existant and the only real sexual experience I had was with a boy in my class, who also liked to experiment.

Then my mother found my stash and confronted me about it. ‚ÄûAre you gay? Would you like to be a girl?‚Äú Certainly I said ‚Äûno‚Äú, what else to say. ‚ÄûGood, so you won‚Äòt need these things anymore, right?‚Äú

And that is how my first stash got thrown out. This happened again two or three times. After that instead of talking about it we both buried it deep inside us and just recently talked about it where she admitted, that she had no idea how to handle the situation and did not want me to be a girl.

Remind you, that was the mid 90‚Äòs, a very different time for thing like that, and not even gayness was widely accepted.

I do not hold a grudge against her for that, but it would have been a bit easier if she had handled the situation better.

During my time in middle and high school I kept exploring further and mentally linked the wearing of feminine clothing with sexual arousal (typical crossdressing), because I did not allow myself to explore other sides of my femininity. Though I presented mostly timid and calm and behaved in subtle feminine ways, wherever I could; but was not really aware of it.

I got asked very often, I am gay. No I was not, I liked woman and occassionally a men.

By the time I graduated from highschool a lot of my friends came out as gay, but I remained in the closet about my transness and wishes. The advantage of this friends environment was, that I became fairly liberal in my views and judged no one for his or her lifestyle.

My stash grew and I purged it a lot of times, not accepting my feminine side and still linking it to sexual arousal. After an orgasm, I could not get rid of the female clothes fast enough, until the next time i was aroused. Pretty uhealthy, if you ask me.

Some of my friends knew about my habit and just accepted it.

Then came my first great love, my first time sex with a woman when I was 20. Oh boy, did I fell in love. She knew about me wearing womand clothing and was more or less ok with it ‚ÄûI get you naked anyways, so the clothes come of on the end.‚Äú I loved the intimacy and it broke my heart for a long time, and to a certain extend still today, as we broke up and led a on off relationship for 5 years whenever we saw each other a few times a year. Thats a long and sad story of self punishment and breaking heart everytime we parted again.

Since that, I never had a relationship again.

Anyways, I finished my apprenticeship in a big firm and decided to go to college after that.

All the time my stash grew and grew and sometimes I wore fairly androginous clothing, took a nightly walk fully dressed up, but stayed in hiding.

When I was thirty my mental health detoriated and I had a breakdown, not necessarily related to the trans question, but more of a kind ‚ÄûI do not know where I am going with my life, I am desperate, I can not go on anymore, I lack a goal.‚Äú

Thats when I had my first therapy, that was more or less useless, but gave me a much needed break and insight. I quit college, or rather was forced to quit and was jobless.

By that time I never wore something else then womens underwear under my ‚Äûnormal clothes‚Äú, still linking it to sexualitiy.

Over the next few years I got a new job, that hs its ups and downs but I am still working it. The situation at work became in the last years very uncomfortable, arguing with my boss, coworkers, etc. I fell and fell deeper into depression.

My thoughts about beeing a woman became stronger and stronger, I wished for it to wake up and see a new female body on me. If I could push a button that made me into one, I would push it in an instant.

Then, last year the situation at work got worse and worse. Constant fights, constant mistakes, deep depression, unsatisfied and hating and loathing to get up every morning. It was all a pissing contest, about who is the alpha male and deeply inside me, i despise that male culture of competition and who has the biggest penis (I know that women are not exempt from this).

In this state I went to my GP and said, that I can not go on anymore, that I am shortly before another breakdown. She set me up on Anti-Depressants and for the first time my head felt quiet. I was looking for a therapist and glady found one in short time that helped me immensely to understand my situation better and why I behave in such ways. I mostly made the analyzing myself, but having someone unbiased to talk to is such a bless.

It was in my fifth hour, that I wanted to talk about the crossdressing. I felt it deep in me, that something had to change and boy, I took the fast lane after that.

Draining my bank account I bought a plethora of new womans clothing, banning all male stuff i had. Buying makeup, appling it (I had already practiced a bit while crossdressing). Telling all my friends, that I was trans and had a new name now, came out at work and to my relatives.

The relatives and work was the hardest part, but it felt really good afterwards.  

And I am lucky that everyone I told is very supportive.

The only downside is, tht my therapist told me that she would not feel comfortable to give me the indication, with which I could take further steps into HRT and all those things, because she has no experience with trans people and would feel uncomfortable writing me a ‚Äûyes, you can‚Äú slip.

Unfortunately there is no informed consent here in Germany, otherise I would have taken that route. That leaves me with looking for a new therapist, which is fairly complicated as the infos for trans people are very, very rare and if you find someone they are already at capacity. This is frustrating.

But I have started with laser hair removal of the beard (because I am a walking rug) and started voice training (Youtube is a good source). I would get paid the hair removal by my insurance if I had the indication, but I could not wait until someone tells me official, what I already know deep in my heart.

I am 38 now, live since three month fulltime as a woman and see now a goal to get to. It helped me immensely with my sanity, albeit I traded gone problems with new ones. But that is ok.

So, why did I write all of this? Firstly I wanted to get my story of my chest, secondly I hope I can give some people that are in the same situation hope, that it can get better, even if you are middle aged :)

I've been experimenting with stereotypical feminine things like shaving my legs and arms, wearing shirts from the ""girls"" section of hot topic, wearing skirts and dresses around the house and to therapist appointments, using ""women's"" deodorant, body soap, and shampoo, painting my nails, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I want to know other ways I could ""experiment"" with things without committing to anything like Hormone Replacement Therapy, Facial Feminization Surgery, etc. For two reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) My family is super conservative. So I don't want to get into this battle unless I am 100 percent sure that I would want to transition. Dad was already super pissed off about painted nails when it was for a science lesson I did.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) I'm a teacher. I teach in a super accepting area of LGBTQ people, and honestly, I could probably announce tomorrow that I was going to transition over summer and I would get nothing but support. But still, I worry.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is going to be giving me a make up tutorial one day after school in the next two weeks. I've tried from learning online but I get confused about what to buy from the store.

With a very transphobic family, I will not be able to do anything about it for a long time. Being that I thought I was a lesbian before, I am already prepared to be disowned and all that and accepted it as out of my control.   
But the situation gives me a lot of time to be nervous about this new information about myself.  


Though I feel that being a boy is more like myself, I am afraid of transitioning even when I'd be free to do so. For one, the medical procedures involved intimidate me greatly. Surgery scares me, needles for hrt scare me. And then there is all that might go wrong and horror stories of potential mishaps.   


Then, there are the social changes with changing who I am. I fear my friends seeing me differently as a boy, thinking me strange, etc. I know they would support me because they are all pro lgbt, but even though they support me, will they see me different when I'm not a woman?  


I also have a fear that people might not think I'm cute as a boy (shallow as that might sound.) As a girl, people actually think I'm pretty and to be honest that makes me feel better with self esteem and makes me take care of myself. I was very insecure of my body as a child and getting to the point where I feel pretty was so hard. If someone said something like, ""you were cuter as a girl,"" or that I ""ruined"" my body, I would feel so awful. I am so afraid of that happening.  


I feel oddly alone amongst my trans friends in this. Most I know dislike their body and transitioning is a way to ""glow up"" and be more affirmed of their appearance. It's hard because I do not hate my girl self. I like her, I've spent a long time growing to love her. But I do not feel like she is rightfully, actually me. I feel disconnected from her.   


Thinking of myself as a boy, I feel more whole. Me as a boy is who I feel is rightfully me- But I don't know him yet. What if I don't like him when I meet him? What if people think he's uglier or don't like him as much? Can I really be the me I want to be or will I just be a murky version of him? What if I go through the trouble of transitioning only to dislike the results?   


I'd be happiest as a cute boy. Trans boys I know and see around me are usually more happy in their appearance and body once transitioned, and I agree they look lovely. But what if *I* can't be a cute boy? Should I just ""settle"" as a cute girl?  


And then there is transphobia that I will now have to deal with. Things as simple as going to the bathroom will now be scrutinized for me. It's not entirely foreign since I'd experienced homophobia thinking I was a lesbian- But being a lesbian was easier to hide for me. If I transition, everyone will see and I'm extremely afraid to experience this new danger.  


I feel as though I've opened a can of worms I cannot close. I wish badly that there was a magical way to just turn me into a cis boy without fear or unknowing of what the outcome will be like and also be completely integrated into my life without worry. Is it worth it? Would it be better to just live in quiet distress instead?

I didn\'t say anything offensive nor was it my intention to hurt that person in anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey thought because i said i\'m a straight male that i\'m implying that they aren\'t a woman which i never said at all!  They said that and i apologized for the misunderstanding. This is not the first time i offended a trans unintentionally. I find myself just sticking associating with guys nowadays, women and trans people are too hard to talk too nowadays. With guys i can say whatever i want call each other names and joke around without getting any backlash, play fight or whatever. Nowadays i\'m walking on eggshells! I don\'t even know what to say. It doesn\'t happen commonly but when it does it gets to me. Especially when i make the effort to sincerely apologize and still have my gutts hated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease give me advice on how to treat/talk to trans people, would greatly appreciate it.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'How can i not be offensive to trans people?', 'created': 1557740026.0}"

I am new here I'm a male and pretty sure I'm 90% low key trans female ( a lesbian i guess )
I will try to make it a short as possible thank you for your patience and time

I went to a therapist last year because of a strong depression but didn't finish my therapy because I lacked money and only met him 2 times and didn't continue with him, sadly I didn't tell him about my doubts of being a trans because I was so afraid

I'm revisiting him next month because the depression is back but I am so afraid and sceptical about telling him about this subject because the main thing that triggered my thoughts is pornography by watching lesbian clips and reading bi/lesbian girls stories (even the lesbian phrase has so much impact on me)
After it I really started to envy beautiful women for being‚Ä¶well, them! Their beautiful faces ,eyes ,hair ( I'm currently trying to prolong it but its bad) , smooth silky skin , feminine body and hips and thighs and butts, feminine chest, beautiful smooth hands and fingers, their beautiful printed nails , their petite beautiful feet and printed toes god they drive me crazy because it a fetish for me,their lovely pheromones, theirs emotions, they're less gross and have less body odors, the power of their bodies, their clothes which they have dense variety of it and pretty much everything i guess, I try to be masculine but it doesn't really work for me.

I really find it hard to tell him all of this beside my other problems in life I'm shy and afraid of his reaction and thoughts of me :( especially i live in an Arabic country where these subjects are taboos and Haram and if he does accept it I don't think I'll tell anybody else because of the mentioned reason my mom will collapse infront of me if I do such thing and my dad oh boy I can't even imagine his reaction because i have 2 mentally disabled siblings and I'm the only hope of the family :( this is so much pressure on me i can barely handle it and I'm not good in life and I chose a wrong Major to study and I'm very depressed about it too

Hormones? Well I don't think so because it will be very expensive and I can't afford it and you guys can't imagine how much bullying I'll receive from my community which Will lead me to suicide and I'm not doing it at the moment because as i said I'm my parents only hope in this miserable life :(

It feels like it's getting worse and worse, every time I try taking a step towards transition it feels like something pops up that makes me take 2 steps back.

There are no specialists on this topic in my area, so I'm working with doctors who have never dealt with this before.

It really makes me wonder if this will work out in my favour.

I wanted to ask these questions, because I feel upset and concerned about the transgender ideology. I have studied Social Sciences and I am aware of the scientific debate and honestly feel horrified with the current situation. 
I want to point out I have sympathy for individuals and wish them well. I feel sex change should not be forbidden, but surtenly be outside of the medical sphere. 
So the questions I wanted to debate about.

A: Should we transition people without scientific basis?
B: If you believe there is scientific basis, whats the basis? 
C: Do you agree that identity is self observed? 
 

D: In case there is no such thing as Transgenderism, what do you believe should be the future of this sub-culture?

547,2019-05-14 01:23:52,boc8sp,0,3,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can and my descriptions of upcoming topics to a minimum for brevity, but I cannot make any guarantees to uphold those statements fully as I often feel more detail is needed if I am to seek out a specific answer.  


But first, some backstory.  
I'm fifteen, AFAB, currently identifying with nonbinary, and have overwhelming chest dysphoria. I have identified under the transgender community since I was about 12, as I first realised my dysphoria around the age of 10 or 11, though I lacked the proper vocabulary to describe how I felt until 2016, when I was 12. I used to identify as a ""genderfluid transmale,"" though that short phase quickly ended as I went back to simply calling myself nonbinary/agender, and as I've now evolved transmedicalist views, I repress that part of who I was a few years ago.  


Now that that part's out of the way, here's my real dilemma. With worsening chest dysphoria and a shift in my desire for medical transitioning - I *am* seeking counselling and hope to start estrogen blockers by the end of this year or the start of next year, though money is the main issue - I have found it harder to express myself as someone who is incapable of perceiving gender, psychologically, as that's simply how my views align (they tend to line up pretty closely to Kalvin Garrah's, but that's another topic.) Throughout childhood, I always had a fairly tomboyish gender expression, but of course, that was before dysphoria pushed its way into my life. Now, I present fairly masculinely, while retaining a sense of androgyny due to the fact that my figure is unfortunately extremely feminine as I have yet to begin HRT. My friends and partner use they/them pronouns for me, with a few of them changing it up occasionally with he/him pronouns as I've tried for the past year to test my comfort levels and have given them direct statements that I was okay with it. Being misgendered as a female in public is mentally exhausting to the point where, if it happens enough within one day, I usually find myself breaking down in my bedroom at night over it, and being addressed by strangers in public androgynously or even as a male (if I'm not seen as female, the former has only happened once before, and the ladder is more common) brings me a newfound sense of confidence and gender euphoria.  


When talking to my counsellor, who specialises with LGBT, especially transgender, youth, she seems to understand my issue regarding this, but all the conversation boils down to is ""well, we'll see when we bring HRT to the table and see how things differ then"" type stuff. Within the past couple of months, I've shifted more towards being more and more envious of cis men in ways beyond just having a flat chest and deeper voice - facial hair, a less feminine face, and so forth. On top of that, I've also been experiencing bottom dysphoria in occasional, completely random bouts, even when my top dysphoria was not so bad on days that aligned with bottom dysphoria showing up. I've tried making (and horribly failing) sock packers, which would boost my confidence shortly before it just got physically uncomfortable to wear because of how I wear jeans. I want so badly to know if I'm actually FtM, or if I'm just hypermasculine and nonbinary. The thought of starting HRT makes me excited, yet I know it's probably so far away because while my family's supportive, we've always struggled with money and insurance. The idea of a mastectomy is also one that is almost too overwhelmingly painful to know I have to wait at least three more years because of how bad my top dysphoria is. But, all at the same time, I like retaining my label as an androgynous person, one of who does not have a gender set in stone. It could be because I've used the nonbinary label for the past 3 or so years that I'm so unsure of myself when it comes to my position in the trans community, but I digress.  


I've tried going to AFAB transgender friends, all of who are around my age and in similar situations, for advice, but I got nothing solid. My partner, who's part of the trans community himself, would be the ideal person for me to seek out advice and support from, but trans topics involving heavy detail or mentions of dysphoria make him uncomfortable, so there's not really much else I can do aside from trying to avoid mentioning it around him.

I have identified under the transgender community since I was about 12, as I first realised my dysphoria around the age of 10 or 11, though I lacked the proper vocabulary to describe how I felt until 2016, when I was 12. I used to identify as a ""genderfluid transmale,"" though that short phase quickly ended as I went back to simply calling myself nonbinary/agender, and as I\'ve now evolved transmedicalist views, I repress that part of who I was a few years ago.  \n\n\nNow that that part\'s out of the way, here\'s my real dilemma. With worsening chest dysphoria and a shift in my desire for medical transitioning - I *am* seeking counselling and hope to start estrogen blockers by the end of this year or the start of next year, though money is the main issue - I have found it harder to express myself as someone who is incapable of perceiving gender, psychologically, as that\'s simply how my views align (they tend to line up pretty closely to Kalvin Garrah\'s, but that\'s another topic.) Throughout childhood, I always had a fairly tomboyish gender expression, but of course, that was before dysphoria pushed its way into my life. Now, I present fairly masculinely, while retaining a sense of androgyny due to the fact that my figure is unfortunately extremely feminine as I have yet to begin HRT. My friends and partner use they/them pronouns for me, with a few of them changing it up occasionally with he/him pronouns as I\'ve tried for the past year to test my comfort levels and have given them direct statements that I was okay with it. Being misgendered as a female in public is mentally exhausting to the point where, if it happens enough within one day, I usually find myself breaking down in my bedroom at night over it, and being addressed by strangers in public androgynously or even as a male (if I\'m not seen as female, the former has only happened once before, and the ladder is more common) brings me a newfound sense of confidence and gender euphoria.  \n\n\nWhen talking to my counsellor, who specialises with LGBT, especially transgender, youth, she seems to understand my issue regarding this, but all the conversation boils down to is ""well, we\'ll see when we bring HRT to the table and see how things differ then"" type stuff. Within the past couple of months, I\'ve shifted more towards being more and more envious of cis men in ways beyond just having a flat chest and deeper voice - facial hair, a less feminine face, and so forth. On top of that, I\'ve also been experiencing bottom dysphoria in occasional, completely random bouts, even when my top dysphoria was not so bad on days that aligned with bottom dysphoria showing up. I\'ve tried making (and horribly failing) sock packers, which would boost my confidence shortly before it just got physically uncomfortable to wear because of how I wear jeans. I want so badly to know if I\'m actually FtM, or if I\'m just hypermasculine and nonbinary. The thought of starting HRT makes me excited, yet I know it\'s probably so far away because while my family\'s supportive, we\'ve always struggled with money and insurance. The idea of a mastectomy is also one that is almost too overwhelmingly painful to know I have to wait at least three more years because of how bad my top dysphoria is. But, all at the same time, I like retaining my label as an androgynous person, one of who does not have a gender set in stone. It could be because I\'ve used the nonbinary label for the past 3 or so years that I\'m so unsure of myself when it comes to my position in the trans community, but I digress.  \n\n\nI\'ve tried going to AFAB transgender friends, all of who are around my age and in similar situations, for advice, but I got nothing solid. My partner, who\'s part of the trans community himself, would be the ideal person for me to seek out advice and support from, but trans topics involving heavy detail or mentions of dysphoria make him uncomfortable, so there\'s not really much else I can do aside from trying to avoid mentioning it around him. It\'s hard to deal with this in a way that makes me feel truly alone and helpless. If more information is needed, I can provide it. But first and foremost, I\'d like to see what the more experienced trans community on Reddit has to say.

Recently my friend who is very passionate about trans rights, although isn't trans himself stumbled across a list on Letterboxd - A social media for logging your film watching activity - entitled ""Shitty trans movies that woke cis people like"" The list consisted of Laurence Anyways, Boys Don't Cry, The Danish Girl, amongst several others. 

I seen Boys Don't Cry three years ago now I believe and to this day find it to be an immensely compelling and core shaking film, of what I can only comprehend the trans life must be like. The friend that found the list, knows of my love for this film, as it is a dear favourite of mine but sent in the list, without having seen the film himself and claimed that I was supposed ""woke cis nonsense"" this kind of offended me as this film really resonated with me, for reasons that I can't really define but know.. If that makes any sense. Anyways, he went on about his distaste for it by pointing out the fact that a trans man is played by a woman. Which is a criticism and problematic element of it, that I completely understand and respect where the distaste comes from based on knowing that alone. However, I find it unfair still to claim that I'm being somewhat dogmatic by loving this film, as I find that regardless of the identity of the actor, it's still a phenomenal performance and one that hits very hard. 

Is there any defenses for this or do all of you agree that the film falls in portrayal and quality based on the fact that a trans man is being depicted by a woman? He claimed it to be ""Pretty shitty"" which as said, I understand but dont feel that it's necessarily the end of the argument with it given how compelling most have found the film.

I'll do my best to keep this relatively short, but I have been know to ramble. Anyway -

My oldest child is on the Autism spectrum. They were diagnosed at about four years old with Asperger's. They are now 22 years old and have been struggling with depression and anxiety all of their life. This is pretty typical for folks on the spectrum.

About two years ago , they came out as pansexual to me and my ex-wife. My response was literally ""I am glad you told me, but I don't care who you love as long as you are safe and treat people with caring and respect"".

Roughly a year and a half ago, they started mentioning that they felt like they might want to transition to a female. This was news to me , but I did my best to support what they were saying. I asked why they felt that way and when they started to feel that way , etc. At the time, the first thing they mentioned was how awful and sad and depressed and anxious they felt ALL of the time. They had dropped out of college and stopped taking an interest in things that I know they loved. So I asked that before they got a full head of steam and got too into the transition thing , that they please see a counselor to deal with the anxiety and depression. I deal with those things myself and I know how much of a rotten existence that can be. I just wanted them to know how to deal with that stuff before they threw themselves headlong into something life altering like a transition.

This time last year, my ex wife and I got a divorce. It wasn't good. My youngest kid moved in with his buddies. He's just a regular dude, fighting early adult issues, but has a steady job , going to school , etc. We are very close and remain so. My oldest moved out with their mother and communication became VERY tough. I started to see them once a week...and then once a month...and now I haven't heard from them in almost 7 weeks. I text and call and snap and message, just to see how they are. No calls on my birthday. No visits. Nothing.

So I have since found out that my ex wife is telling folks, I've heard this from multiple sources, that I don't support their transition and THIS is why I am being ghosted. So if she telling other people this, the story I am telling myself is that she is also feeding this to my eldest child.

I just want to talk to my kid and make sure they are ok. I don't want to preach to them or even ask about a counselor or whatever. All I want is to make sure they are doing alright. Fuck man, I lay awake at night and just hope for one text or a message or something. Nothing. I miss them terribly.

Pardon the use of the generic pronouns. I don't know what their current preference is, as we haven't spoken in some time, so I went with they.

So I identify as cisgender female, and I am in a relationship with a MtF. As a bit of background, my gf is from out of state and doesn't really have any friends here yet. She has large amounts of social anxiety and shuts down in most social situations.

We really only have 1 Trans awareness group in our area. They do a lot of support groups, and we have both been interested in going. However, GF has a lot of hesitation about going because all of the group's would separate us. There is a group for only trans/nb identities to go, and one where only spouses can go. They don't have any support groups we can go to together. 

Which would not be terrible except she is scared to go by herself and has refused to go without me. We also want to be able to find friends together, and other couples to do things with, as well as finding her own friends.

There's also a few members that have expressed that our relationship isn't valid because ""trans people only date in the spectrum"". 

I don't know if I am just being ""gender privileged"" or whatever the term is (let me know if this is the wrong term) but it kind of hurt my feelings. I'm not trying to put myself  in the spectrum, or say I deserve to go to these events because of whatever. And I understand this is what people on the trans spectrum experience every day.

They have an event coming up that is a ""queer trans dance"" and their rules don't say anything about only trans persons being able to come.

So my questions are: Should we try to go to this dance? Should I ask the hosts first? 

Is it acceptable that the line about my relationship not being valid hurt my feelings, or am I being entitled? Is this a normal viewpoint?

What do you suggest we do about moving forward in trying to find new friends in the community, both as just myself/GF, and as a couple?

Please let me know if this is not a post that should be here; or if I have used any wording that is incorrect, or offensive, so I can correct it/learn the right ways.

I had thought sealing the court records of my transition would protect my personal information, but now I have more concerns: future employment in a mostly male field in a particularly trans-unsympathetic state; mandatory disclosure of former aliases on background checks; leaky ""private"" records that have little barrier against abuse.

The DMV in particular is my latest frustration. It seems there is no (legal) way to get a driver's license under my soon-to-be legal name/gender unassociated in record with my current (male) one, which forces me to connect dots that I assume anyone half-motivated could uncover.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/17/dmv-data-safeguarded/24886267/

This goes for other records, too; are future background checks that run my fingerprints (which I've given for an FBI background check) or my SSN going to bring up my birth name associated with old records?

I don't want to be indirectly forced to disclose that I'm trans in order to demonstrate my lack of debt/criminal history, or worse yet be vulnerable to someone who might target poorly secured databases for my readily available personal details. Is there a way to have these records (assigned-at-birth info) locked down via- or post-legal-transition? Somehow umbrella'd under your new legal name? Are there other alternatives for trans folk, or for people with specifically *sealed* name changes?

It really matters to me to be able to decide when/to whom I disclose my identity as trans. I'm lucky to be in a position of passing well, and I'm in a conservative area I don't currently wish to leave for reasons of work/family. Either way, I find it equal parts ridiculous and scary to have personal information so exploitable, especially in a way we could be uniquely vulnerable to.

624,2019-05-15 11:53:11,bowzeb,9,1,"Hey, I'm 19 AMAB and have been questioning my gender for a few months now. As a kid I was always weirdly naturally feminine, preferred hanging out with girls, would like pretending to be female characters when I was playing imagination games with friends, preferred playing female characters, wanted to wear feminine clothing sometimes and didn't get why I couldn't, etc.. I sort of vaguely had a thought that I might be trans when I was like 14 and then again at like 17 but I didn't think too hard about it, but recently I've come back around to the idea. There's a few things throwing me off though and I've been hella confused for ages.

I don't experience gender dysphoria as such; I experience something that may or may not be tied to dysphoria but it's hard to tell exactly. I developed pretty bad body dysmorphia around the onset of puberty and started feeling depressed, dissociated (like I had no sense of identity and was just existing) etc. but I don't know if that's dysphoria or just standard mental illness. I also get a very happy feeling a lot of the time when I picture myself as the opposite sex that could be gender euphoria, but it could just be some kind of placebo effect that I've been tricking myself into feeling. That's been one of my main doubts.

I've also been sceptical of my motivations recently. The thoughts that I might be trans seem to come and go and vary in intensity; they peaked around January ish and then sort of faded but then came back again recently. I'm currently suspicious that I don't actually like the idea of being a woman and that I actually just like the idea of being trans as it offers an answer to why I'm so depressed/anxious and gives me hope that my mental illness(OCD, depression) could be cured by transitioning. Does that make sense? I'm worried that I might just be clinging onto the idea of being trans as a miracle explanation for my mental issues.

I'm not expecting anyone to decipher what I can't and come up with some diagnosis, but I guess what I'm asking is how can I know if I'm trans?

2.) I‚Äôm aware being on HRT is making me more prone to anger
3.) I don‚Äôt want to be seen as ‚Äòthat easily offended trans person‚Äô

I‚Äôm in a group chat with friends, we all get along very well, they know I‚Äôm trans. 1 friend is even in a relationship with a trans person but this is where it gets weird.

Out of the whole group, this friend is the only one who posts trans memes from time to time. Only twice, as far as I have been aware, in fact.

The first time, I got pissed, sad and withdrew to think about my reaction, to examine if it was justified, then talked to my friend. They were genuinely sorry and said they wouldn‚Äôt do it again/be more careful.

The second time just happened. It was less offensive than the first joke but still a bit...not quite right. I asked right away if they show these jokes to their trans partner. They said, no definitely not (imo showing the partner the jokes would at least help make a good judgment of if the joke is actually funny or offensive).

Now, I really don‚Äôt understand this. If they claim to respect their partner as much as they do, but don‚Äôt dare show their trans jokes to them...doesn‚Äôt that already show on some level the friend knows the jokes aren‚Äôt funny??

Why keep posting them, then? Really?

I hate having to be on my toes, to walk that fine line between being too easily offended and calling people out on bullshit. I know I should leave the group but that‚Äôs not really an option for me right now and I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll blow over as this doesn‚Äôt happen a lot.

So im a straight guy, born male with no intention of reidentifying as female. Cis then, right? Maybe, but then again maybe not.

So, when i see an attractive woman, there are two simultaneous thought paths in my mind. 1) i want to fuck her and 2) i want to *be* her. Okay, not actually steal her identity or nothing, but you get what i mean.

I have a lot of conflicting behaviours. In public, a work etc my behaviour is pretty standard masculine, though sexual banter makes me feel uncomfortable. Dont like to engage with it, dont really want to hear it.
At home with my wife (straight, born female) my behaviour is distinctly feminine. I sashay around, i snuggle, i always want to be the little spoon and so on.

When it comes to clothes, i feel pretty comfortable in either male or female garb. When i was younger and slimmer id dress in drag every halloween- really put the effort in, too. Didnt want to look like a bloke in a dress but an actual woman.

Im quite happy to be man. I like my penis. I like girls. I couldnt even imagine having any surgery. However, if you said to me right now you can 100% turn into a woman, right down to the cellular level id say yes without any hesitation. Well, one hesitation. My wife isnt into girls, so maybe if i was signing up to my next life in advance.

Im not confused. Im not afraid to admit who i am. Im not living in denial. Im not waiting to admit the truth about myself. Neither am i dabbling, nor curious, nor fetishising. This *is* the truth of me.

731,2019-05-18 08:06:50,bq1kct,0,1,"Hi everyone!

So, I am about to finish ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness‚Äù by Arundhati Roy and I wanted to ask some questions about it if anyone has read it.

I am not trans (nor cis), so I wasn‚Äôt sure if what I was feeling was misplaced or alright. Obviously, people will have differing opinions but I wanted to ask about trans people‚Äôs perception of the book.

[MINOR SPOILER]

One of the main characters of this book, Anjum, is a trans woman. Roy has quite a graphic writing style and I felt uncomfortable reading some of the parts in which she described Anjum‚Äôs dysphoria. Given that neither she nor I are trans women, I was not sure if either of us were mistaken about something. I wondered if it was actually normal that I feel bad, given how hurtful dysphoria can be. Or whether if her language was just too ‚Äúshocking‚Äù so to say.

If you have read the book, how did you find her description of Anjum, her voice, and her gender confirmation surgery? Did you feel she got some things wrong or were they spot on? Of course it‚Äôs probably a mix, so what was right and what was wrong in your opinion?

I personally was a bit offended by her saying Anjum had ‚Äútwo voices‚Äù after transitioning, one masculine and the other feminine.

732,2019-05-18 08:15:31,bq1lvs,2,1,"Worried about chances of getting pregnant which is like the most triggering uncomfortable nightmare for many f2m trans people. I also vented at the end so you can skip that if you want because this whole thing is just gross to me so I'm sure it will be to others.



So to start off I'm trans f2m, and the idea of pregnancy literally has me so dysmorphic I'd rather stab myself in the stomach than go through with it.

The reason I say it's unlikely for me to get pregnant is I may be intersex (I don't have a diagnosis yet) but I don't get a period at all. There's more to it than just that such as I grow facial hair and other things but I don't want to get off subject too much. I've never taken hormone therapy but people who knew me when I was younger (like before puberty finished) have thought I did due to my voice being deeper and having stuble. That's just how I naturally developed though.

To add to that I had a doctor want me to take some form of hormone therapy around 17 or 18 to regulate my body more but I declined because I was looking to be less female, not gain more female hormones.

Ok enough backstory here's what happened:

Just over a month ago I had a condom break right before the guy finished inside me, and of course right away I went to paranoid thoughts of pregnancy.
(Edit: I think we used a spermicide condom but not 100% sure)

Whenever I think about it I notice I feel bloaty or nauseous, but its ONLY if I think about it so idk if I'm just making myself imagine it.

I also had a small amount of spotting appear on toilet paper (one wipe only, not a lot) a few days after the incident which I read can happen when an egg attaches, but this blood spotting was also right after another round of sex that day, so idk if it could have just been from a tear or something as it was shortly after.

I'm going to try getting a pregnancy stick test from somewhere discreet within the next few days most likely, the only reason I hadnt so far was because the idea of having to walk into a store and even speak to a cashier about one makes me feel so shitty due to being trans.

On top of everything I also work in porn and the condom break incident happened with someone I was filming with. Like I don't even know his full name and he's super not my type, even aside from dysmorphia I would never want to accidentally have a child from a stranger I'm not even attracted to or would even be friends with.

When I was younger before I understood sexual health or that my body didnt quite function normally I had lots of unprotected sex with no issues, despite accidental internal finishes more times than I can count. That was from age 16 through 21. If I take my young and dumb track record into consideration I already can see how the chance is pretty low.

But what do you guys think? I will go get a test. I just want some opinions now because I'm stressing and feel totally disgusted.

And I really want to vent about this all tbh. I don't even like vaginal sex and am a dominant gay trans guy in my normal day to day life. I only do the v if its for a film. I'm planning to stop that once I get surgery, because while I didnt mind it at first it grosses me out and I have an extreme resentment for straight men in general due to filming with them and them treating me like a girl. Like as if my persona wasn't an act. Like they know it's literally just for the videos and that it's not my thing. But that doesn't stop straight dudes from thinking me, a dominant gay trans guy would be their girlfriend in real life.

1. I'm seriously not fucking attracted to yall. I like androgynous and feminine guys. Masculine guys especially those with beards make me want to vomit. (Not that there's anything wrong with masculine guys lol I'm just more saying that as a vent at specific ones who think they can somehow make me into them, make me be a girl, and make me submissive. Like no lmfao. Not happening. Ever.)

2. When the condom broke I actually did puke. It was super gross and I made sure it wasnt noticed, basically I just ran into the bathroom and already felt vomit coming up my throat just at the mere thought of someone's cumload being in that area of my body. I spent HOURS in the shower and smothering every external part of my body in hand sanitizer. But God that feeling of having to clean out the cum made me so violently sick to my stomach I can't even think about it now.",trans,Any F2M people have advice?

Long before recognizing i was trans, I thought I was a lesbian, so I have already come to sort of accept that it‚Äòs not my fault that I am being disowned and that I have a right to go forth and be happy and live as I want to without hurting anyone.

For a long time, i‚Äôve been purposely distant to them because I know I‚Äôll have to say goodbye some day. It‚Äôs sort of worked, but as the time to leave grows closer as i become an adult, the reality of it becomes more heavy on me.

835,2019-05-20 17:33:13,bqylsr,8,19,"Aight so first off, overall positive experience, for those who are apprehensive to read these 'field reports'. 

This will be a bit of a stream of consciousness, so I'm sorry if it goes long. I don't have a point to this beyond 'what is it like being visibly trans in New England?' This weekend was essentially what I expected, trans stuff wise and is par for the course.

My wife and I attended 'Women's Gravity Weekend' at Highland Mountain Bike Park, which was a beginner / intermediate MTB clinic. Great park, good trails, and all the staff involved were wonderful. The clinic was comprised of mostly New England and Quebec residents.

I pride myself on not doing things that I feel I'm only doing due to being trans. Ex. Weekdays I shave and do makeup for work because personal grooming is important in the workplace. Weekends I skip shaving often and almost never do makeup because if I'm just doing sports or yard work, whats the point, eh? Obviously if I feel like it and WANT to do it, I'll do it, but I refuse to make a habit of it. I add this because I didn't make that much effort to present cis female. I was there to ride, damn it.

So I show up, clearly trans, (7 months HRT) small boobs, feminized facial features, some sparse facial hair, 5'11"", clearly have gone through male puberty, but also pretty reasonably obvious that I'm not a regular cis male.

I walk up to the check in booth and say I'm there for the clinic, no one bats an eye. My voice is so-so, I do not sound like a cis male but it is rather low for a women's voice and not quite there yet speech pattern wise. The instructor is very nice and processes me like normal.

We go outside and stand around waiting for everyone to file in. I test my rental and actually manage to wipe out in the lamest way in front of the group. I yell 'no one saw that!', and people chuckle politely.

We eventually get to our lessons, there's a few 'lets go around the group and say where we're from and what we want to get out of today' type things, so soon everyone had heard my voice, which is worse and more male when I'm out of breath and have a full face helmet on, limiting my jaw articulation.

We do a lot of sitting on our bikes in line waiting for our turn on obstacles, etc. So there's a lot of chitchat amongst the women. I'm included in it with no one acting like it's weird that I'm there.

We go to lunch, I sit with my wife next to a mother and her daughter and shoot the shit with them. Same deal, no one acts like its weird. I kinda feel like people are turning an ear to me trying to figure me out, but in a curious, not 'wtf' kinda way. It helps that my wife is very smooth with slipping in references to me being her wife, calling me she, etc.

After lunch we go for more practice then go for a downhill run as a group. I, in my usual fashion, bite off more than I can chew and eat it. I scrape myself up a little (nasty looking road rash, no debriding, stitches, or skin grafts needed though.) and smash my head, giving myself a mild concussion. One woman pulls ahead to the instructors to report it.

While reporting it, she keeps calling me 'he'... my wife, listening to the report, keeps interjecting 'she!', until eventually 6+ of the group of women are shouting it too. I'm giving the woman the benefit of the doubt that she was just in adrenaline mode and focusing on giving a report.

We go to the medical building, they check me out and release me. I just kinda chill at the lodge while my wife rides. Over the rest of the day and the next women from the group keep calling my name and asking if I am okay and generally just being really nice to me.

We go to our AirBnB, my wife is very nice and takes care of me, which I appreciate but isn't interesting from a trans perspective.

Next day we go out again, I'm taking it easy, do some easy trails and some fundamental practice. I only eat it once doing a jump and I just bail from that pretty well. When I was getting my rental bike for the day the teenage clerk kept calling me 'he', but everyone else in the shop kept correcting him or pointedly calling me 'she'. Honestly the kid sounded like he'd had his fair share of blows to the head over the years. Women from the group again keep checking in, saying they're glad to see us back out there, etc. 

All in all everyone was very nice to me and accepting of me in an explicitly women's only space, and I had a great time.

1. What even is gender? If gender is defined by outward appearances and cultural norms, then why is gender identification so important? 

2. Can the trans community be toxic for men and women? Many trans people tend to embrace stereotypical masculine and feminine traits/outward appearances. Are these decisions enforcing current gender stereotypes and are they simplifying what it is to be a man or woman as simply outward appearances?

3. Is transitioning the correct approach or should cognitive behavioural therapy be tried first? If someone feels uncomfortable  or mismatched with their body, could gender dysmorphia be addressed as an alternative to transitioning?

4. Is transgender always an accurate term? Is transsexual considered a slur? This seems like a more accurate term for someone who alters the appearance through surgical transitioning.

940,2019-05-23 07:08:55,brzujd,1,2," I have started the subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/transprotec

I want to inspire cis people to do some work and become politically motivated to help trans people. That includes participating in marches, rallying at local events where trans people are denied rights, and working to protect trans people in vulnerable situations by standing beside them, walking with them, and doing whatever else is needed.

Before opening this up to cis people I wanted to make sure I am going in the right direction with this. I want to ask what is really needed from cis people, what would be helpful, and how we should go about doing those things. I ask that you give some feedback in this thread as well as posting anything in the sub that you think is important for cis people to learn, to focus on, or to do. Hopefully we can use these things to take up the fight alongside you and help you gain your rights and safety.

I am also looking for moderators. I would like all the initial moderators to be trans people so they can help guide the discussions, add and remove content as appropriate, and ensure this doesn‚Äôt become a cis echo chamber. Being a mod for this sub will not be easy. You will likely have to remove many unpleasant comments, and it will take a lot of emotional labor. If you are up for it please contact me. I am more likely to choose people who are already moderators, and have spoken about trans issues on their account, but neither of those are required.

Thank you. I hope we can create a network of people who can be called upon to help and serve the trans community.",trans,I am creating a sub to better educate cis people on trans issues and build a network to assist trans people in their fight for rights.

So the thought of me coming out when I was younger wasn‚Äôt an option because I know that my dad would have beaten the shit out of me.

Anyways, onto the issue: Since I'm 18 now I have all the possibilities I didn't have before regarding my transition and I've already talked to my therapist about it and we both agreed that one of the next steps should be to come out to my parents. That's obviously what I'm asking for advice for.

Real quick, my parents aren't super anti lgbt or anything but they are pretty uneducated in stuff that has to do with it. My mum is super open and always willing to learn about new things though, especially when they're important to me, so I'm not too worried about her reaction. My dad on the other hand is a little more close minded and while I don't expect the worst from him, I still don't think he will react that well. As an example, we once had a discussion about being gay and at the end of it he just said, in a really annoyed tone of voice: ""Well, whatever, if you were a lesbian, I couldn't do anything about it anyways."" I Interpreted that as ""I would tolerate you being a lesbian but I wouldn't like it and wouldn't support it"". Which isn't ideal for coming out as trans since he can't just ignore that about me like he would be able to with sexuality.

My colon-vaginoplasty revision with Dr. Maurice M. Garcia at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center was successful, it was done on May 13th. The best hospital in the country. But sadly, my ""vagina"" still looks malformed. The gaping open was filled with the colon and I have 7"" of depth, but my ""vagina"" still looks like a wrinkly ball stack. I'm also now unable to reach my clitoris, it won't spread open.

I know what you're thinking, ""Oh, it's probably just inflammation."" Well no, a lot of it has come down, to the point where I see that there will be no fundamental changes in appearance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Myth #1:** *You don't have to dilate.*

Wrong. You still have to dilate, 2 times a day. If not, you will lose depth.

**Myth #2:** *It won't smell like feces.*

Wrong. If you don't douche, it does. You must douche everyday for the rest of your life.

**Myth #3:** *The discharge will eventually stop.*

Wrong. There will always be mucus discharge, which is green to yellow and is slime-like. While it may be true that it will decrease in a matter of years, it will never stop.

**Myth #4:** *The colon-vagina looks natural. You can't see the colon.*

Wrong. The colon is visible. It is dark red and covered in mucus. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have this botched and malformed vagina still, but at least now there's functionality right? I'm fucking done. All I wanted was a functional and pretty vagina. I don't understand how someone can blow off their face with a damn shotgun and get a nice looking face through cosmetic surgery, but yet my case remains hopeless. It's not fair.

I'm starting to show signs of borderline personality disorder and sociopathic personality traits. 

I'm starting to find it difficult to empathize with others. 

I have high functioning autism and I used to be very affectionate, but now the thought of it makes me physically nauseous. 

I'm starting to enjoy inflicting pain on others, it feels good to me. 

Inflicting pain on others so they can feel my pain is the best feeling in the world.

I'm having constant homicidal thoughts about Dr. Satterwhite and my former therapist. I was assured everything would be okay. I was promised. I was told it would be possible to have a pretty and functional vagina. They deceived me and then they abandoned me when they realized they couldn't help me anymore. They deserve to die. 2 years of being disabled and lied to, it makes me very mad to think about how much time was wasted. 

I was handsome as a guy, I had a nice penis size and I enjoyed my sexuality for the most part. But I really wanted to become a girl and I was told it was possible. But it's not possible. It probably never will be. It was all delusion.

I won't make racial comments, but I have plenty to say if I were allowed.

I have so much hatred in my heart now, that doesn't scare me. What scares me is that I realize I'm slowly losing my sanity. But I don't care. I plan on dying and I look forward to it.

I think if there was a button to become a bio female I would press it, but I don‚Äôt think I want to transition because I (myself) will never feel like a ‚Äúreal girl‚Äù (this is not to say any of you are not real girls, these are just my own feelings about myself.) It just feels like since my hips are already fused and my shoulders and face are already ‚Äúmanly‚Äù that I would always feel bad whenever I looked at a bio woman. Like I‚Äôm not enough like a girl. I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever have the balls (haha) to get FFS.\n\nWould any of you mind bringing some valid discussion and arguments to the table that might help me see this from a different angle?

1078,2019-05-26 07:40:11,bt5974,3,4,"So as I said, I just want to get this off of my chest, and maybe ask for some advice, so here goes. (MtF)

Ever since I can remember, I've always been pretty feminine for a boy. Even in kindergarten I wanted to play with the girly stuff, and would always get laughed at for being that way which caused me to close those feelings off for a significant part of my life. Now that I'm finally out of high-school and part way through college, I've had these thoughts of not wanting pretty much anything to do with 'manly' stuff (aside from video games since they're too big a part of my life now) and instead, wanting to do more with 'girly' stuff like makeup, dresses, and just relaxing with friends having silly conversations (Yes I know that that's all stereotypical girly stuff, but it's all I can think of at 1:30 in the morning). My biggest problem comes in with my grandparents and aunt. My aunt lives with my grandparents, cleaning the house, making sure meds are taken, that sort of thing. Now, I doubt my grandparents would care that I'm trans, but my aunt? Oh no, I know that she would have nothing to do with me after she learned, and that doesn't surprise me considering how sensitive she is. Like she's the kind of person to get upset at nothing. My grandparents lives are already a nightmare with my aunt living with them, and I don't want to cause any further hell for them in the last decade of their lives from my aunt overreacting and 'banning' me from visiting them. For now, I'm just doing simple things such as having some slightly feminine, but could still be seen as masculine clothing that I'll wear out in public, and then a dress at home for when I'm lounging. As a quick side note, I know that the rest of my family are/would be supportive. For example, my parents and brother are in support, and I know that my uncle (one of many) would be in support, but I'm not telling him yet because he likes to yap his mouth. (Best uncle I have though that I've meet).

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I can do in secret while I wait for my grandparents to die so that they don't have to deal with the hell that my aunt would create? And yes I know that sounds morbid, and no, moving isn't an option because I'm broke. Also, is there an option for hrt that doesn't cost too much money because again... I'm broke... And I suppose I'll ask this last, How in the world are you supposed to walk in heels!?! I trip and fall every time I try to take a step, and I've been trying for weeks now!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Always been more feminine than masculine and I got bullied for it causing me to hide those feelings.

1086,2019-05-26 18:45:27,btbiqk,6,6,"In April of this year, I started seeing a gender therapist due to issues with my... gender. I'm 18 and AMAB but ever since I could remember, I've always preferred being a girl and being labelled a girl. For example, whenever I would play in the playground as a child, I would always prefer to be female characters so people would refer to me with a female name and female pronouns. If there was more roleplaying, I would really enjoy being treated as a girl and I remember having dreams of being a girl (even one I can still vividly remember where I remember looking down and seeing a girls school uniform and it just felt *right*). The euphoria I feel from situations like those have prolonged to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was quite in touch with my feminine side before going to secondary school, but as I went to an all-boys school, I learned to repress my femininity in efforts to blend in and not to single myself out as someone who was different which I believe has lead me to become mostly masculine presenting now. Whenever I think of being a girl, I feel a lot happier with myself in those thoughts than I do when I imagine myself in the future as still being a guy.

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing my therapist for a few months and telling him this stuff, he said he's willing to write me a letter to my GP so that I can start the process of being referred to a gender identity clinic in the next couple of years. The waiting lists are too long so I'll probably go to GenderGP to get HRT to hold me over until I get proper treatment from the clinic. However, these past couple weeks have been absolute mayhem. I came out to my grandparents and they were nothing but supportive but I still have my doubts about transitioning. I know in my mind that I would happier as a girl, but the fact I experience little physical dysphoria is really bothering me as I do believe that in order to be truly transgender, you need to have dysphoria.

&amp;#x200B;

The dysphoria I do experience is from my body hair, facial hair, being labelled as a guy and being expected to act masculine. I don't get any genital dysphoria and my chest feels like there should be something there but I wouldn't say it causes me discomfort (Although I really dislike having sex with my shirt off and I prefer to wear a baggy shirt or hoodie). I'm 5'8"" and that did cause me dysphoria until I realised that there are loads of cisgendered girls that are as tall as me, if not taller. I also had shoulder dysphoria until I learned that they really aren't that broad and after comparing them to cis girls' shoulders I found them to be pretty close on average.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my problem is, I just don't know if I want to transition for the right reasons and the fact I don't feel this overwhelming dysphoria like other trans girls really bothers me. I'm constantly going back and forth between whether I am trans or just gender non-conforming and it's really stressing me out to the point where I can't even enjoy anything because everything constantly triggers thoughts of my gender and I just want it to stop.",trans,"I'm so confused,sad and honestly I don't know how much longer I can deal with this.",1558921527.0,"{'created_utc': 1558896327, 'id': 'btbiqk', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'In April of this year, I started seeing a gender therapist due to issues with my... gender.

I've thought about adopting too though even that process seems very costly, lengthy and arduous. Then I've thought about socially how my children would be treated being the children of a trans person. Would they be accepted? Then completely unrelated but what with climate change the way it is should I even have kids right now, is that selfish when the world is like this? There's a lot going on in my head and I'm sorry for the lack of clear cohesion and the general scattered nature of it, but if there are those of you out there who questioned whether you'd ever be able to transition or if you thought, ""well I don't want to be in this body but I could stay in it if I had to, if I could find some other outlet or way to channel it or something."" Are there those of you out there? Are there those of you out there, especially those of you getting older who thought you wouldn't be able to transition but have somehow found a way? Are there those of you who want biological children?"" I guess I just want some reassurance. I want someone to say you don't have to stay closeted forever.

It then got me thinking about aging as a more masculine person, how would I adapt to that.) Though I do want my own kids if there is any way.  I\'ve thought about adopting too though even that process seems very costly, lengthy and arduous. Then I\'ve thought about socially how my children would be treated being the children of a trans person. Would they be accepted? Then completely unrelated but what with climate change the way it is should I even have kids right now, is that selfish when the world is like this? There\'s a lot going on in my head and I\'m sorry for the lack of clear cohesion and the general scattered nature of it, but if there are those of you out there who questioned whether you\'d ever be able to transition or if you thought, ""well I don\'t want to be in this body but I could stay in it if I had to, if I could find some other outlet or way to channel it or something."" Are there those of you out there? Are there those of you out there, especially those of you getting older who thought you wouldn\'t be able to transition but have somehow found a way? Are there those of you who want biological children?"" I guess I just want some reassurance. I want someone to say you don\'t have to stay closeted forever. Every person I go on a date with I think ""would they like me still if they knew?"" I know that if they didn\'t they\'re likely not worth it in the long run but that\'s a lot of rejection to face, but even staying my biological gender would take a lot of sacrifice on my end.  \n\n\nAnyway I\'ll stop here, again sorry for the chaotic lack of organization of this post.

So basically they're only really thinking top surgery as their chest makes them super dysphoric but isn't really looking to go on T.  
They're working part time at a cafe so doesn't have heaps of money to set aside.  
So i'm wondering if you folx know about a country/place in (preferably) Europe that's relatively cheap?  
i'm fully aware that a surgery like this is never going to be cheap and also one should look at quality etc more so than price but of course money is a factor so i'm just looking at options.

1119,2019-05-27 14:05:43,btmcjj,8,18,"Wow, off-my-chest confession time.

**I have to say I've been fucking confused my whole damn life.** I am a biological male, and was bullied a lot for being effeminate, which began in PRESCHOOL. I cried too much for a boy, and my 3rd grade teacher thought I was ""special needs,"" and I think even downgraded me to prove her point. I've gotten teased for girly hand gestures, girly dance moves, girly vocal inflections. By friends, family, the works. I've had friends and acquaintances try to assure me I am gay, I must be in the closet. I had one college ""friend"" who was convinced I was gay, and so proud of her gaydar, she wouldn't drop it for 3 years. (Like, wtf? How would that help anyone?)

My college did a drag show every year, and I did it sophomore year. I had so much fun shopping thrift stores for clothes, shaving my whole body, wearing makeup, styling my long hair, and just being a woman. One of the top 3 happiest moments of my life. And then we went out for sandwiches outside the college bubble. I was like, ""Should I go like this?"" and my friends were like, ""Yeah why not?"" They were super cool, but the guy at the sandwich counter gave me the most disgusted look I've ever seen as I was reaching into my clutch with painted fingernail man-hands. All that pure happiness evaporated and I felt so goddamn ashamed and gross. I didn't do any more drag shows and went back to suppressing it.  

*I don't want anyone to look at me like that, ever.*

For the longest time, I didn't know what I was. Am I genderqueer? Genderfluid? Bigendered? Two spirit? None of these felt like they fit even. I felt like a freak. I felt ashamed to be me.

**And then the SNAPCHAT filter came out.** I don't have snapchat, but I got it exclusively for this purpose, and I was OBSESSED. Oh my god I spent an entire weekend going around taking secret selfies of myself. She looked so happy! So confident! So proud! I don't share them with anyone, it's just for me to figure out who I am. 

It also freaked me out how much I looked like my mom! But, if I really was born female, I would probably look a lot like my mom. I still look like me. And suddenly, my conflicted relationship with my mom makes a lot more sense. While I still consider myself my father's son, I am also my mother's daughter. 

**So what's the deal with me feeling genderqueer?** It's still possible that I am, and just on a week-long female expression high. Time will tell. But right now I think most of what makes me feel male is being raised male in this society. If enough people treat you like a man, you start to think you are a man. (OK ""we-re-not-transphobic-just-speaking-logical"" haters, yes I am a biological male. But the more I seek therapy, the more I self-improve, the more confident I am that I am trans) 

**Maybe I'll transition someday, but right now I'm OK presenting as a male and expressing myself in other ways.** More power to all the MtF heroines out there who are brave enough to transition. Not all women wear high heels and dresses. Also, I kinda don't feel safe to present female, I live in a very conservative area, and I suspect it may cause conflict in my career I'd rather avoid. But I'm happy enough to express it in subtle ways. I'm going to keep my girly gestures and dance moves, and there's an earing I wear that's subtle but helps me express my femininess. And writing stories with female protagonists has always been a wonderful outlet for me.

**And what's more is I'm not just done being ashamed of being me, but I'm starting to feel PROUD.** I can see all the benefits. This duality I've lived with has helped me see things from different perspectives. For example, I can see women's issues and men's issues, and how they intertwine. And being able to do that has helped me listen to others and be kind in non-political conversations and situations. There are some wonderful ADVANTAGES to being this way I didn't consider. 

**So that's it. I'm trans, and for once in my life I'm making some sense to me. Not sure what to do now but just be happy being me.**

She also described and shared her severe depression, especially at the inability to come out to her family or live as her preferred gender. She disclosed that they self-harm and experienced suicidal ideation very frequently. I have talked her through and down a lot of nights where I was very scared I would never hear from her again.

She fears coming out to the family she lives with will be met with resistance, denial, and even removal of access to the outside world if not outright vitriol. She sees no other ways out of her situation, and fears that even if her family does accept her she will never be who she wants because of the stigmas associated with being trans.

I'm 22 AFAB and I identify as trans. I prefer male pronouns, I have always disliked anything feminine since I was a kid, have never wanted to bear children, and a bunch of other little things that, looking back, I've realized was kid-me trying desperately to break free from gender constructs. Gets worse when that comes with hitting puberty at 9 and developing extremely fast. üòë

I've had gender dysphoria since I was around 16/17, i just didnt have a name for it. My senior year of high school i came out as trans, and it felt great. I was comfortable in my identity for a year or two, then a hellish night came where I was getting picked on by my significantly older brother and his then-wife. After that, I swore off my identity and tried over compensating being feminine. I started wearing makeup, dresses, tried growing my hair long, or at least keep it feminine. That ""worked"" for a few years. Any dysphoria I'd smash with being extra feminine that day. I outgrew all my mens shorts and never bought more, put all my ties and such in a box, threw out my binders...

And I'm back to being trans again. I never was not trans, but I was desperately trying to be cis. So here I am at 22, more comfortable in my weight, my appearance, my spirituality, my environment, my education, but still struggling with stifled dysphoria. I tried identifying as genderfluid or genderqueer or androgynous or just enby, but the only identity I feel comfortable in is just trans. I dont feel exclusively male, I feel more like a nice blend of male and female both. 

But since I'm trans, I feel like I can only be exclusively male presenting, so the dysphoria has shifted a bit. I bought a new binder, have lovely new mens clothes, I'm back to having a masculine haircut, etc. But I also have a lovely dark, almost gothic dress that I've been itching to wear. But since I'm out as trans again, I feel like I cant wear it. I feel like I'm ""not trans enough"" since i like a couple of the feminine things I picked up in my few years trying to be cis. I feel more like a doll on display of ""this is what it's like to be ftm"" than a human being who is by nature fluid. I feel like now that I'm out, I'm more dysphoria. I'm not out to be ""a real man"" (what a toxic term), I want to be a lovely mix of the masculine and feminine, somewhere on the androgynous spectrum as far as appearance. I want to be a guy, but I dont want to feel uncomfortable in the few feminine things I love too. I say I wouldnt ever shame a masculine-identifying person for wearing a dress out, so why would i hold myself any different? But I get so many ""you're so pretty/cute/beautiful/feminine "" comments that I legitimately want to cry. I want to be seen as a boy wearing a dress, not a girl in boys clothes. So that kills me. 

I took a chance and came out to my mom again and she was really understanding and cool, which I'm blessed for. But I'm feeling still heckin anxious that I'm ""not trans enough"" because I dont necessarily want to change my body and still like some feminine things. I know it's such a cliquey thing to feel. I just am not sure I AM ""trans enough"" to take hormone or get top surgery. But I am ""trans enough"" to feel like an occasionally feminine-presenting dude and prefer male pronouns. I'm so confused, I just need either validation or some help.

And, like i said, trans has been the only label that fits my personal identity. I never feel like a ""girl"" or ""neither"" or ""both,"" I just want to be a dude who wears dresses sometimes but I'm still a dude inside.

It's getting to a point where its hard to focus on anything else.\n\n It's all very strange to me and I think that it's important to note that I don't have these feelings towards males. It's not sexual in any way, it's almost like I want to be them.\n\nI come from a pretty conservative family/friend group so seeking assistance from close ones is off the table. My lifestyle and dress is mostly preppy, so honestly these lifestyles are very different from one another and I'm not sure why I feel this deep longing to be like them, I'm not sure if these are trans feelings or not... These feeling have only come about in the last half a year or so and have gotten progressively worse, I'm really confused and could use some help in what this means exactly."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Advice/Help on my Thoughts', 'created': 1559075426.0}"

I was loading music on my wife's phone. She is clueless on the silliness of music apps etc. I have an account tied to my email. I use her phone to log in and support her new app. Somehow my contacts were loaded onto her phone and who knows what else. 

She went down the list of contacts to delete the ones that did not pertain to her life. I didn't think much of it. I've been transitioning over the last 2 years (üòçüëçüòç). But I don't pass or ever think I will. But during all this I made contact with makeup specialist and the stores associated with all that comes with makeup. As well as surgeons associated with all things transgender M2F. Her questioning me on makeup (I don't wear any) because I think I look like a dude in makeup. Whole dysphoria trigger subject (sorry if it is for anyone else). That was the first thing questioning me on my direction (wife and I are still working on our relationship) not easy for either of us. So I get defensive for being questioned. She internalize a lot of stuff instead of talking about anything. She will ask me a question that has no good answers. Example: Are you wanting to wear makeup? Why do you think that way? It sets me on a course of self loathing. I'm months away from affirming surgeries. Will this allow me to pass? I don't know (I hope that is the case) Its her resistance to all this that is a road block. Nothing I can do but try and comfort her- slash placate. That's what it feels like anyway. Not wanting to rock the boat too much and help her get comfortable with who I am becoming. 
 
The other thing that set me off was going down all the contacts with her, just knowing that most of these connections are going to dissolve when I come out. Never mind the anger and resentment of the ignorance I will have to face. Example is one ""friend"" has said stuff like ""chicks w/dicks"" or another one has made fun of a transgender person by talking to me in front of her as an ugly tranny. I don't like to defend her or anyone because of these assholes ignorance. I DO,  ever time. It's not so important to pass. I know this I really do. But at the same time I want to pass or have a more positive look. Not the Mongo looking freak I feel I am. (Not looking for hugs) just making a point.  If I could extricate myself from the tiny minds I definitely would. Unfortunately some, not all are contacts that facilitate a task in my work life.

&amp;#x200B;

Today i had a thought i think its worth to work on. It's realy fresh and not full grown. 

How about thinking transition to be analogous to a software edition ""2.0"". In fact it's a new major release. Since we are all born in something like an version 1.0 we decide to do major changes, recode our live and ourself into version 2.0.

&amp;#x200B;

I know, today some devs push releases and major releases multiple times a year, but i can remember times when it was a big milestone when a new major version of a software was released. This was always a process of multiple years with often significant visual and internal changes.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's something similar with starting the own transition.

I felt the need to comment on some of them and I did so now I'll probably be debating with a transphobe for the next week while my mental health deteriorates.\n\n Are there any extensions that will help me get rid of transphobic recommendations and autoplays on YouTube?"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Why am I getting recommended transphobic documentaries?', 'created': 1559211819.0}"

I am finishing up my Master's degree in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL).  


One thing that has continually troubled me throughout my tenure as a teacher, and in the field of TESOL, is that no one is making any attempts to teach gender non-binary pronouns in ESL classrooms.   


There are likely a number of reasons for this, none of which I feel are valid enough to continue on this way!  


That's where YOU can help!  


I have designed a short (&lt;5-minute-long) survey for trans and non-binary folx to fill out that will bolster my case that it is unacceptable to not teach 3rd-person singular pronouns that are not ""he"" and ""she.""   


CW: some of the questions in the survey concern your attitude with being misgendered in different scenarios. Any questions that make you uncomfortable may be skipped. Of course, all your responses are anonymous and will not be shared with anyone.

1224,2019-05-30 06:59:43,buq1yx,4,6,"To clarify, right away; I *am* transgender. I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria officially about two years ago, but had been aware of my condition and angling to pass since I was twelve. It's a journey still ongoing, and although I happily pass most of the time, there's still work to be done. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I just.. *abhor* being labeled as transgender. I have no issue with other transgender people, and I *know* that it's what I am, but I've taken to hiding the fact that I even am transgender in order to avoid being called as such. I isolate myself pretty far from the community because I've never, *ever* been able to just. Identify with it? Sitting in a circle group and sharing my experience as a transgender man with other transgender people is something that makes me horribly uncomfortable, and it comes back to the same reason as before.  


I don't want to be labeled as transgender. I don't want to be known as the trans friend. I barely ever describe myself as transgender, because I don't see it that way; I'm just a boy. A man. When people ask about my gender, I say I'm a man, and that's it. Being called transgender makes me feel like I've been called out, like I'm the token queer of the group, or, even worse, people around me begin to treat me like a girl despite everything I've told them. Despite me passing *easily* as a man. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified that I'm some sort of secret transphobe. I don't interact with other transgender people often, but I've never *hated* them. I admire and respect the community for the acceptance that has been built, and for the progress made. One of my best friends is, also, transgender, and she has no problem labeling herself as such. Gender means nothing to me in relation to other people; this awkward self hatred is my first real struggle with it, outside of the whole, well. Transitioning part. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why it feels this way. I think it might be dysphoria kicking in again, trying to convince me that I'll never be a real man, no matter how much I Try; and my natural reaction, as a spiteful little gremlin, is to oppose that as strongly as possible. Even if it means cutting myself off from what I technically am, apparently.   


I don't know what I'll get out of posting this. I think I just want to feel less alone. If anyone has advice, or the same experience or anything, please comment.

1264,2019-05-31 10:26:40,bv5u88,0,2,"So I was curious exactly how uncommon it is to uh... be a virgin at 22 because you hated your body so much you wouldn't let anyone touch or see it? Like, I see a lot of trans people like ""Oh I used to have tons of sex when I thought I was gay"" or whatever and I just physically couldn't do it, I haven't even been shirtless since I was 6 going swimming.

Similarly, I kinda forced myself into isolation to stay closeted, I only made 2 friends who aren't my brother because I literally couldn't help myself. I guess I'm secretly extroverted, which kinda makes sense. Anyway, I didn't wanna get close to people and be found out, I thought I'd either run away from home and transition or commit s**cide by 16, and neither of those happened.

Will I ever be pretty? I see so many attractive women, and my heart sinks because I've only seen a man in my reflection no matter how hard I try, and it's especially frustrating to see the few girls who completely pass pre-everything like I am. I know it's vain to think beauty matters so much, but I would sell my soul in an instant if it made me pretty.

Oh, and uh, how the hell do I ask for hormones? Like, my plan is to just go and see if the OKC Planned Parenthood does informed consent, since I finally have spare money for once, but I'm terrified to just ask outright, especially since I'd probably get shot on my way over trying to present feminine and very obviously failing, I feel like they'd constantly second guess me because of my baby biker appearance. I say ""baby biker"" because I go around in a sorta biker getup, but I am neither big nor burly and do not possess a beard or drink alcohol.

I see so many attractive women, and my heart sinks because I\'ve only seen a man in my reflection no matter how hard I try, and it\'s especially frustrating to see the few girls who completely pass pre-everything like I am. I know it\'s vain to think beauty matters so much, but I would sell my soul in an instant if it made me pretty.\n\nOh, and uh, how the hell do I ask for hormones? Like, my plan is to just go and see if the OKC Planned Parenthood does informed consent, since I finally have spare money for once, but I\'m terrified to just ask outright, especially since I\'d probably get shot on my way over trying to present feminine and very obviously failing, I feel like they\'d constantly second guess me because of my baby biker appearance. I say ""baby biker"" because I go around in a sorta biker getup, but I am neither big nor burly and do not possess a beard or drink alcohol.\n\n\n\nI am terribly sorry for the audacity of my posting, but I hope everyone else is doing well.

I'm a 20 year old, AMAB, have been questioning being male for a few months or so and I'm still completely lost.

I guess I've never really fit the stereotypical ""male"" definition, I've stopped myself several times from joining clubs or doing activities that are considered ""feminine"" (ex. dance or volleyball).  I've also had a lot of trouble historically with making male friends, I was in an all-female friend group in high school and I still feel weird expressing emotions to males.

Now that I'm in a much more inclusive environment and have taken care of some mental health problems (to some extent at least), I've started to think more and more about my gender.  I've started to go as they/them pronouns in some of my circles that I know are inclusive and it just feels more right than he/him that I've always gone by.

My problem is I don't know what to do from here - am I a closeted female just holding myself back, or am I genderfluid or genderqueer or what (and what do those even mean)?  Obviously I don't expect some random stranger to just bestow an identity on me like it's the sorting hat but I really don't know where to go to or who to ask for answers.  I've talked to a few people who have gone through similar things and it sounds like everything just came naturally over time, but I feel like I really should get an identity cemented while I'm still at college (and still in an inclusive space).

Growing up in a space where a non-binary gender was the butt of many a joke at the dinner table I'm also concerned about how my family would feel - not that they would disown me or anything, it's just going to be incredibly awkward.  Not to mention work, or classes, or socializing in friend groups that haven't seen anyone step outside the binary.  Part of me wants to just ignore this whole thing and just go as male forever because that would just be ""easier"", but I know that's not going to make me happy in life.

hello friends! this is gonna be a sort of depressing post so if you don't want to get bogged down by the big sad‚Ñ¢ go look at the super cute selfies people are posting in this subreddit instead!

so i'm non-binary, and my friends at school almost always use the correct pronouns for me (they/them) and correct others when they use the wrong pronouns (even when i don't because i'm a coward oof). i really appreciate their support, and i definitely feel super lucky to have really accepting friends, but i feel so disheartened when they slip-up and use she/her instead. i know they're trying, but i can't help but feel like everything is performative and that even though they're using the right pronouns most of the time, it's just to be a good friend and not really because they see me as the gender i want to be perceived as. i would love to say, ""hey i'm ok with any pronouns!"" but i know that most people would use she/her because i look more feminine and am AFAB when really what i want when i say any pronouns is to be referred to with a mix of pronouns. and i know that i can't change years of ingrained societal ideology about gender and gender roles, but when strangers automatically default to seeing me as a girl i just wanna cry. (insert screams) to make things worse, i recently sort-of started seeing someone and i told them my pronouns/gender identity from the get-go and they kept introducing me as their girlfriend!! i was super pissed and obviously broke it off with them, but i was also just really freakin sad and cried in my room for a while. anyway, this post doesn't really have a purpose except for venting, but if y'all feel the same, how do you deal with it?

Okay so I'm m2f, and I've been on hormones for several years. There's a lot I have figured out but a few things I haven't. And I don't know if these are normal things, just me things, or what. 


I do not have a period obviously. I take a shot at the same dose, on the same day, at about the same time, every week. There are still recurring patterns. It's not exactly monthly, and it's not exactly consistent, but it's obviously hormone driven. I'll get irritable, retain ridiculous amounts of water, and other nonsense. The nonsense varies. Read the side effects list and pick some at random. It's like that. 


My obgyn tests my hormone levels. They've always been in a normal range. I can't explain it. The best-worst I can come up with is I'm some variety of bipolar, but that doesn't explain why it doesn't last more than a few days and then I pee what seems like a gallon of water. Or maybe I'm crazy. This would not surprise me. 


Up next, boobs. I grew some, they're small but hey. My question is... Why do they still hurt sometimes for no reason? I've been on hormones for over a decade. They are not growing. But every now and then, my nipples will get angry with me. This goes away in a few days. It's not from fabric rubbing on them or anything like that. They just decide to do this. Sometimes they feel tender on the sides too. As an aside, winter and stairs suck, and I'm still bitter about both. But what can you do.


Lastly, and this one I couldn't find in any side effects list or anyone mentioning it online... Opening jars, lifting things... Anything where there's a lot of pull on my skin. It hurts now to put the same effort into it. I don't know what to call that quality of someone's skin, but it seems like it got... Stretchier. Maybe? It's easier to cut, bruise, and in general seems more fragile. Maybe it's because I'm getting older but I don't look old, and my skin doesn't feel old. I didn't notice this until I had been on hormones for a few years. Being easier to bruise is a listed side effect. The rest no. 


Anyway, thanks for your time, and apologies if this all seems stupid. I could not summon useful answers from Google or my friends.

57,2019-05-08 11:12:51,bm3xz0,1,0,"I have been thinking about the idea of gender-fluidity but I can't think about it properly without knowing what exactly is being debated.

From what I understand, the claim is that gender should be separated from sex. I think everyone agrees that there are only two sexes: Male and Female. 

Gender has historically been associated with gender in such a way that these two terms became interchangeable.

The idea, as I see it, is that there's an attempt to strip this connection. This can only happen in two ways:

  1.  You define gender to be a completely subjective term that represents how you feel about what you are and   
acknowledge that there is an infinite amount of possible genders. This also requires gender to be removed from   
legislation, replaced by the word ""sex"", which holds the same meaning as the old ""gender"". The result is simply a   
new word that represents how you feel about yourself. 

2.   You define gender very carefully to avoid having to exclude it from legal documentation by creating subgroups belonging to the preexisting gender classification, for example:

2.1 Male Man

2.2 Male Woman

2.3 Female Man

2.4 Female Woman

This allows the society to still apply the same rules and filters while also recognizing the validity of different ways of expressing yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gathered, Scenario 1 is much more common. There are no problems with either scenario, as they still preserve the meaning of being a Man or a Woman. As an example for why it's required to preserve this idea is sports. You can't have a transgender woman playing on a woman's sports team. In scenario one this woman would be classified as a Male and the team would be called Female's sports team. In Scenario two it's the same thing except the Woman would be classified as a Male Woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first question is, do you agree with what I said or do you believe in a different scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

My second question is this: In either of these scenarios, no real differences in the society happen, except for the illusion of ""acceptance"" provided by the change of meaning and application of a single word.  Why would it be desirable? How would this help? The problem I'm having with it is that not only does this require a lot of effort to implement in a way that doesn't confuse society, it's also fueling the acceptance of a psychiatric disorder, similar to changing the word ""reality"" to whatever you think is real, in order to help people suffering from schizophrenia accept themselves better.",genderqueer,What is gender?,1557339171.0,"{'created_utc': 1557313971, 'id': 'bm3xz0', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'I have been thinking about the idea of gender-fluidity but I can\'t think about it properly without knowing what exactly is being debated.\n\nFrom what I understand, the claim is that gender should be separated from sex.

i'm a masc-leaning genderqueer person who was wondering if there are any good ideas on how to wear v necks (or lower :B) with a binder on. it feels quite masculine to me to be able to wear a shirt with the top button or two undone, but i've never been able to do it while wearing my binder (have to wear shirts with [all the buttons up](https://i.imgur.com/yAYoHur.jpg) and i'm always [adjusting the neckline](https://i.imgur.com/It0yv1E.jpg) if i unbutton it sigh), since obviously they need to be quite high in the front to bind ""properly"".

i have in the past learned to do what they call open chest binding (i used to be a cosplayer lol) which looks great of course but it uses lots of sports/medical tape which is really bad for your skin and also expensive for everyday use so please don't do that. i was wondering has anyone discovered other binders that have lower cut necklines, or has anyone even dared to trim/alter one of their own? i'm actually considering buying a new one and cutting into my old one, but i worry that it will cause the binder to fray or bind less effectively.

Today is like Valentine's day is for single people if that's not true for someone. It can feel like they're missing out. And for the LGBTQ community, today can be hard for a lot of us. Many of our parents didn't accept us. And family get-togethers prompt uncomfortable questions about whether to go, how to dress, or just being alone with our thoughts.


I thought for awhile what I could possibly say that would help. For me, there are so many questions and things  mom would have taught me that I don't know or had to learn on my own or from friends. Simple stuff, like how to wash my bras so they don't turn into a tangled, burnt mess. Or hard stuff, like desperately wishing I could have snuggled up after a bad day. I wish we'd had more time. That things had been better. 


That's what I think about today. Mom stuff. I also wish I could have had kids of my own, but being transgender that was never in the cards. So for me, today is a hard day. Today I'm spending with a friend who's mom is mentally ill, and has a drug problem. My own mom hasn't been accepting of me, but we still talk. She tries.


We all have times when we need a Mom, and sometimes she can't be there. And sometimes we can't be there for her, either. So it's on us to be there for each other when those times come. So I'll say this...


Tuck in your shirt. Be nice to people even when they're mean, maybe they're just having a bad day. It's okay to cry when it hurts. Brush your teeth every day. Color safe bleach is not detergent. You should make your bed because even if everything else today goes wrong you'll still come home to a made bed. Stuffed animals are okay no matter how old you are. You're okay just the way you are.

Does anyone have any presentation/fashion advice on how I could mix definitely male and definitely female aspects?

Ways to express female-ness are easy for me to think of: I'm AFAB with no plans to go on T so it's easy for me to get gendered as female. I can also think of a lot of fashion things that are coded female: painted nails, skirts, etc.

However, I have more trouble thinking of things that are *definitely* male. I personally don't want facial hair (and can't grow any since I'm not on T), although that's one example. It's considered normal for women to also wear pants and blazers, and I don't want to just look like ""a girl/woman in pants""!

Generally, are there any things that are considered definitely masculine and *not* tomboyish/androgynous?

I also think I might get a traditionally male haircut, and I'm also looking for advice on this specifically as I know very little about men's haircuts!

I also apologize if I misuse terminology or say anything incorrect. I am still learning, so please educate me!

&amp;#x200B;

As it says in the title, I'm AFAB, bisexual, in my late-20's. As a child I was a tom-boy, then went through the quintessential teenage goth phase. Through most of my early twenties, I felt comfortable with my femininity/womanhood. Through college, I felt comfortable in dresses and wanted to be seen as female. Recently though, I've been having some issues with how I perceive myself. The past few years I've been dressing masculine more often (but not always!) I tend to still wear makeup -- sometimes because I truly enjoy it, but other times I feel as though I'm not going to pass anyway, so I may as well keep presenting as a woman. I'm not going to lie, but that new SnapChat filter has me all kinds of fucked up. Seeing myself in a more masculine way, with a stronger jawline and facial hair almost made me sad? Because it made me realize that sometimes when I dress masculine I wish I looked like that. Sometimes I wish I legitimately WAS that person who was like 6'2 and muscular with a cut jawline.  


I was discussing this with an AFAB friend who identifies as a cisgender woman but dresses masculine just as often as she does feminine, and her experience seems different than mine. When she wears masculine clothes she likes being seen as a woman in masculine clothes. But when I dress masculine I wish I wasn't as curvy or my breasts were smaller. I feel like my body doesn't fit what I'm trying to portray to the world. In that same conversation, I asked if she'd ever visualized having a penis -- both sexually and just in general, and she said she had never felt that way. Even though the years where I felt comfortable with my femininity, I have always had thoughts about having a penis and what it would feel like. That being said, I'm not consistently uncomfortable with having a vagina either.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly thought that everyone felt this way, so I have never fully questioned myself as a cisgendered woman before. And I think because I just thought it was ""normal"" I've never felt like...strong feelings towards being misgendered before. I feel so silly to only be considering this when I'm nearly 30.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm an AFAB in my late-20's. In the past few years, I recently started dressing more masculine, but I felt fine with my femininity through my late teens/early twenties when I was dressing more feminine. When I dress masculine I wish I had facial hair/a different body type. I have had thoughts of wishing I had a penis since childhood, both in a sexual context and just in general (but not all the time). I've not necessarily felt horribly misgendered until now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's up to me to fully define myself, but I just came here looking for some answers in order to guide my path. Is it common for a cisgender person to have had feelings of wanting the opposite genitals for most of their life? Is it common for gender fluid/non-binary people not to experience strong feelings of being misgendered through their life? Is it possible to want to present as masculine but still wear make-up or paint your nails? Is it common for gender fluid/non-binary people to have very long stretches of feeling male/female/both?

119,2019-05-18 01:12:39,bpzbf0,5,8,"Hi all,

I think it's been very prominent in my life that I do not like a lot of the traditional male roles in society, I am gay and most of my interests would be considered traditionally feminine, such as makeup, and I have a strong interest in drag which started years ago when I was a lot younger. I  am perfectly happy with being male...but somehow I still feel uncomfortable in social situations, and I really cannot explain the feeling to the fullest extent.

I hate people referring to me as a ""man"" and in fact it actually makes me cringe, and I think that's due to the ideas I personally have about what a ""man"" should be according to society, and I have never fit that mould. I've had a very big personal issue of alienating myself from a very young age due to my sexuality and I have a lot of issues now because of it, I cannot make friends or hold conversations with men and am uncomfortable within social settings where we're divided into ""boys and girls"". During school this was a huge issue for me, I hated and refused to do my phys ed classes because of this. 

I have considered the idea of being trans \[MTF\] but, I'm not uncomfortable with my body and i'm not uncomfortable with me being myself, but I don't know if ""myself"" is necessarily male or female. I have a love for all things feminine which I live out through drag and other means but I don't wish to really  live my life as a woman. or identify as one. My problem is mainly with the stereotypes/roles/limitations set on me from existing gender, so I have no idea how to conclude this. 

I have also considered the idea of being gender fluid or gender neutral, but I'm unsure of placing a label on myself that I don't know if I fully subscribe to, despite me actually feeling as though my gender is extremely fluid.

I fit the stereotype of my AGAB way too well, and every time I step outside of it, just a little, hoping that someone might at least change the way they think about me, I feel like I'm being ridiculous or creepy. 

I usually like reading media that portray non-binary people not being misgendered, being respected and understood, but right now this only brings jealousy (of fictional characters, what am I even doing). 

I completely understand why people would find me ridiculous if I tried to be myself: I hate this fucking body, just like I hate the stereotypes associated with all types of people. No should have to deal with anything even close to this.

This is a throwaway post for the usual reasons. I'll include a TL;DR. Sorry for mediocre English, I'm not a native speaker.

So, a little bit of context. I've been with my GF for 5 years. We met in uni, lived together for some time and for our first year of working life are in different countries.
There were times when she would feel bad about something I said or issues with her family and she wouldn't let me know until she got into a very dark place and really needed some support. She took more than a year to told me about her previous, abusive relationship, or about the times she struggled with racism. This led me to grow a little paranoid and ask her very often how she was feeling, etc.

About a month ago she called me, very anxious, and she told me she was questioning her gender. I told her I was relieved she told me, that I was listening if she wanted to open up about this but she replied that telling me about the issue was enough. I didn't push much because it was over the phone but we agreed to talk about it someday.

Now this weekend I'll be visiting her and I want us to at least help somehow but I'm really unsure how to proceed. Since we both want to enjoy our precious time together I'm afraid she'll try to brush it off. 

How do I bring this up in a healthy way? Should I pry or not at all?
I would also be interested in ways to find communities where she could openly talk about it.

Thanks a lot for your time.

169,2019-05-27 02:55:41,btgsxb,0,2,"I am starting to have a lot of doubts as to what I actually am, at start after years of denial I decided to find a gender therapist to talk about it and kinda thought I was clearly a trans woman, therapy didn‚Äôt rly help much other than being an anchor for me so I won‚Äôt go back into denial, so don‚Äôt suggest that because I literally cannot talk about more deeper stuff to therapists, only the person I‚Äôm emotionally attached to,so unless I find a therapist bf they are useless for me.

I spend many years in denial, really scared of any kind of femininity  yet at the same time often had thoughts of being female, in both normal and sexual ways which I told no one, I was quite insecure about being paired with anything female, literally never shaved cuz of that reason too, and my insecurity was quite obvious to my best friend since he did notice like some areas about that felt like he touched a nerve so wasn‚Äôt even surprised when I told him.

The thing is at the start I obsessed over passing, like I thought I wanted to look fully female(mostly face/body wise since I despise make up and most female clothing since it‚Äôs all revealing and tight), but now after around 6 months of hrt I started liking my appearance, which rly isn‚Äôt very female yet in a way I‚Äôm ‚Äòsatisfied‚Äô

Like can be confused for a woman from the sides due to my long hair or from far away which I had before anyway, but pretty much everywhere we would go with my (gay male) friend on our vacations ppl called us ‚Äòguys‚Äô, which I honestly never minded, randos opinions mean nothing to me really so never had this whole ‚Äòwaah they misgendered me thing‚Äô probably because I‚Äôm unsure of my own gender at this point. Though I do enjoy when my friend makes jokes about me being a woman(not sexual) or use female pronouns in private since he knows I lean more that way but I don‚Äôt want everyone to do that, it is like I feel fine being a weird male in public using my chosen male name and keep that other side as something more ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô

So in general, I kinda look like a fat guy with long hair and somewhat feminine face that is pretty male from the front, body is pretty chubby so boobs can probably pass as moobs outside and I wouldn‚Äôt mind having the bottom surgery since I always disliked having a penis since it always felt so wrong and useless but that is a far away dream now so I need the money for other stuff rn. I pretty much look like a rly weird somewhat female looking guy that acts like a gay bottom which I technically still am I guess?

I rly have absolutely no idea where I fit in label wise, I‚Äôm definitely not a normal trans woman since I dislike any kind of female clothing, mannerisms and don‚Äôt want anyone but my rly close friend know I lean towards there but not that much, I honestly feel more something in between now so I‚Äôm rly unsure if I would count as non binary or something else.

171,2019-05-27 08:31:00,btjjw2,0,1,"Specifically, what is dysphoria?

Google tells me that dysphoria is specifically:  ""A state of feeling uneasy, unhappy, or unwell.""

If we take it a step further, we can identify gender dysphoria.  Which is an uneasy, unhappy, or unwell feeling regarding one's gender/gender identity.  

Personally, through all my confusion and questioning I have discovered that I have found the most amount of happiness in referring to myself either as genderqueer or genderless.  Since that realization, my sense of dysphoria has slowly dwindled down to be less and less.  The only time my dysphoria starts to kick in nowadays is when I cannot properly present myself as I wish to be seen, which I'm learning is more difficult than I imagined at first.  But what is easy about all this, anyways?

Onto what I've been thinking of.  I feel like its weird that the only times I ever hear people talk about dysphoria in general is in reference to their gender expression or gender identity.  And while I understand the importance of having a gender identity of some sort since gender is omnirelevant within our language, I feel as though dysphoria is a much more broad topic than simply gender alone.

You can feel uneasy, unhappy, or unwell and be dysphoric about a lot of different things.  I know people to be dysphoric about specific aspects of their bodies, things that are unchangeable or unmoldable.  They seek out plastic surgery and other such things as means of alleviating this all of the time.  People work out and go to the gym, they wear makeup, they buy better clothing, they meditate and seek out religion (or some other form of belief).  All in the name of bettering themselves and further developing their own personal identities.  

People are dysphoric about a lot of things.  Before I struggled with my gender identity I struggled with religion.  Before I struggled with religion I struggled with other things.  There seems to be so much more to life than your gender identity, religious identity, etc.  That it becomes difficult to define a person by their gender.

But we're human and we want to fit everyone into boxes and categories, nicely organized rather than the chaotic jumbled mess that we really are.  

I'd argue that cis people experience dysphoria too, they just don't really have a name for it.  They might not be struggling with their gender identity, but they might struggle with some other form of identity instead.  And I'm starting to come to the conclusion that we could do some good for this world, if we all started being a little more honest about the subject than we were.

Transpeople, genderqueer people, agender people, gender nonconformists, they're in a unique position regarding dysphoria.  They are put into a position where their sense of self is so radically different to the bodies that they're born in, that they absolutely have to change at least *something* about it in order to start feeling good about themselves again.  But I think the reality is that everyone in this world is at least a little bit dysphoric about something.  Some things we have to just accept as flaws we'll always have, some things we can change and improve and adapt upon.  But with cis people, never so much as *questioning* seems a bit odd to me.  Never once asking the question about what life would be like if you were in some way *different* than you've always been.  To me it seems strange to never at least ask yourself the question.  Oh and I don't know what's going on inside a cis person's head.  But what I do know is that I see people questioning gender roles, gender identities all the bloody fucking time.  And its not just transmen and transwomen.  Its every-single fucking one of us.  At least to some degree.  

I wonder what the world would look like if we just allowed everyone to question freely with no shame, no judgement, no hate.  And then we could all experiment to our hearts content.  Would I be the same as I am now if that were the case?  Probably not, but I don't think I'd be ""me"" either so I'm not sure if I want all that freedom and power for self-expression.  Regardless, I feel like it would be better.  And I think its time everyone started being a little more honest about it, cispersons included.

179,2019-05-29 01:12:54,bu8blt,3,6,"I've had uncomfortable gender feelings for a while here now and I can't seem to sort them out on my own. 

-I'm AFAB and never really minded being raised as a girl. Kids called me a boy as an insult and it hurt but I'm not sure if it was just their nastiness as a whole 

-I'm deeply uncomfortable when I display more ""masculine"" personality traits. I say masculine with a grain of salt bc I don't really buy into that as being much more than a construct, but I identify as a lesbian and I'm terrified of being overly forward with anyone I'm interested in like I perceive cis men doing. not sure if that makes sense.

-I don't think I want to be male but when I think about having sharper features I think it might be nice. Don't really want bottom surgery but I think at least a significant breast reduction might be nice if not a mastectomy 

-I don't mind she/her pronouns but referring to me as anything that feels maternal or matronly like ma'am gives me the heebies. I don't want kids by any means bc i can barely care for myself but the thought of myself ever being pregnant specifically makes me want to die

-I don't like my birth name. I've been on the hunt for a new one no matter my gender alignment and I think a more unisex name would be freeing. Hard to find one that makes sense  

-I am really uncomfortable with my weight (overweight) and a lot of that is definitely fat phobia and difficulty finding clothes but a lot of it seems tied to being perceived as  some mother archetype. I maybe have BDD but gender seems pretty tied in too

-Cis guys who show interest in me freak me out and a ton of that is the gendered expectations they project on me. I wonder sometimes if I'm repressing bisexuality because I don't want to be ""treated like a woman"" by a (cishet especially) dude or seen as ""the woman"" by outsiders in this hypothetical relationship 

-I like the idea ""demigirl"" presents but sometimes I want nothing to do with gender at all. I often like being female aligned and would have trouble letting go of a sapphic understanding of myself on some level at least 

so essentially I know I'm struggling with gender roles and body issues, but not sure whether I'm struggling with gender identity and kind of don't get what gender identity feels like beyond roles kinda. I think I'd be much happier if gender in general wasn't really a ""thing""  in our society but I can't imagine a world like that clearly enough to figure out whether there's anything beyond that for me. Also I don't think I intrinsically have the most stable or consistent sense of identity (childhood trauma lol) but these feelings have been getting louder for a couple years here. 

I find it hard not to hate and be ashamed of myself on some level and I'm sure gender isn't the only factor there but if it's one at all, I think I want to start addressing it.

193,2019-05-30 21:00:45,buyhnx,4,12,"Today a story bubbled up out of T_D about a gender fluid school shooter, which made it to /r/all before getting deleted because the headline was misleading. Claims of a coverup now abound. Last week they closed a school because some 12 year old trans kid was a victim of a witchhunt. They were going to kill that child. Silence. The week before some asshat with alphabet soup at the end of his name got banned off Twitter and a bunch of people lost their minds; A doctor trying to weave a narrative that supported transphobic views with a bunch of half-truths and pseudo-intellectual crap. People cried censorship and ignored what happened when they didn't put a lid on this shit last time; Antivaxxers and a literal plague. He's still out there practicing medicine. 


The week before that -- you know what, it's every week. It's been every week for years now. Imagine a boot stomping someone in the cunt every week forever. That's me. I'm under that boot. Society has gotten ugly, and it's violent, and every last one of them believe they're on the right side of justice, god, logic, or... whatever. I don't want to be right -- I just want to stop getting kicked. There are no sides in this war I want to be on. 


People on the left (I'll get to the right too -- I'm eo/aa/omgwtfbbq) are all about raising awareness, inclusiveness, and tolerance. Which is fine and dandy up to the part where they're so open minded they actually believe there's a million genders, think putting 'preferred pronouns' on our introduction name tags is thoughtful instead of horrifyingly deaf, and get so busy virtue signaling with each other they fail to notice. I've actually had them correct me -- on how to refer to myself, or tell me how to think about myself. I get told all the time I shouldn't be friends with people who don't ""accept you for who you are"" -- as if they have any business telling me who I get to associate with. How is that inclusive? I can respect the intention -- but not the result. 


Not to be outdone, I'm a punching bag for the right. All of us are little anti-christs running around murdering and pillaging decent society with our wicked queer ways. We're what they point to when they spit and say ""political correctness."" We're the punchline for the big bad ""liberal"" agenda, and they will unload dump trucks full of bullshit they think is ""logic"". It's half-baked verbal diarrhea about chromosomes and biology and no matter how many arguments are demolished they've got another lined up fresh from the vast ghetto of social fucking media. 


It's all just rationalizing deeply felt anxieties about the future, the unknown, ""those people"". They live in constant fear, all their media screams and gushes out fear. Their amygdala has a taser shoved in it. They think facts and truth are discovered once, and then need never be investigated again. Yet they'll believe a screaming fat guy pushing herbal remedies talking about how the government is turning the frogs gay. Or tell us not to ""flaunt"" our gayness when we wear a rainbow pin as they drive by in their jacked up coal burner with a ten foot wide American flag stapled to its ass, two silhouettes of women in bikinis stuck to the back window, and red white and blue truck balls. Facts and logic though, right? Free speech but only in the comfortable, designated areas picked far out of view. 


The two sides both point the finger at each other; All *I'm* getting is the finger. 


Everyday I wake up and open up my dresser and I make a choice about how much I want to be abused. Wear jeans and a t-shirt and I'm a guy until people are standing next to me in line and notice the bra lines. Wear a dress and I'm the tranny and parents try to awkwardly shovel their kids out of the aisle when all I'm there for is some flavor of ramen. But don't worry -- they all like Ellen on TV and have a gay neighbor so it's cool, right? 


I have my breakfast -- a handful of pills and that's usually it. I go to the grocery store about once a month maybe and I've lost over 50 pounds in the last year because it's easier to just not eat than deal with people. That's not the only reason though -- I work in a restaurant, it's just I'm so anxious all the time I don't have an appetite and can't eat more than a handful of anything at a time or it's a visit to the porcelain goddess. 


And I know it's a problem -- the doctors just turn me away and tell me it's a problem best solved in therapy. I've already got another pointless appointment for next week to tell another one I'm actually totally fine and nothing is wrong... I'm just here to generate revenue. You want to know what queer people talk about after group therapy is over and the therapists leave? It's how to lie to them to jump through all the hoops. It's insane that so many people have to lie to fit into a narrative about them that grew up out of the culture of 40 years ago and expected to do that in the culture of today. And ironically, it's considered socially *progressive* they get treated at all.


Hundreds of experts with degrees and piles of studies and books in little rooms all over America are so utterly divorced from the reality of what their patients are going through it's heartbreaking. For a lot of people, ""do no harm"" may as well be ""do nothing at all"". The sad truth is, they're scared of the general public too. Scared they'll be sued, or arrested -- and I'm not gonna sit here and tell them they should be brave and do what is necessary when I'm locking myself in gas station bathrooms and passing out facing the same shit.


The doctor's office has become a political office where they prescribe thoughts and prayers instead of medicine for too many people. I don't know anyone I haven't had to say ""You just gotta keep trying until you find someone who gets it."" Honestly... a lot of people just give up and live in misery until depression catches up to them and they check out. Oh, it's so sad, but you know, there was nothing anyone could do. Except, you know, treat them as patients... or even just human beings. 


I go to work and I see the men talking with the men, and the women with the women, and nobody's talking to me because I'm not really either to them. Oh, they're polite, it's just that everyone is more comfortable with me not existing so I quite conveniently went ahead and did that. It's nice when people remember the right pronouns, but speaking for myself it doesn't mean a whole lot if nobody's comfortable enough to actually talk to me. I mean, I can start conversations with them but the reverse doesn't happen. I make friends with people -- they don't make friends with me. Almost nobody initiates. That's the daily reality of this culture war. And even within our community, we're often too uncomfortable with each other because there's no scripts to follow.


An endless war
_________



Driving home it's just the music cranked up and stuffing the memories. Mom still can't say 'daughter' after fuck-all years but progress because now I'm just the ""older child"", ""sibling"", or whatever. She calls once every few weeks to see if I'm still alive, say she loves me. Offers to help with the job search with a few bucks for a certification. Forgets she tried charging rent and said she wouldn't help with college after I came out. Forgets she's gone back on pretty much every promise she's made. Like everyone else. I tell her I love her too and hangup the phone, because against my better judgement every day I still want a family. And I wish I could have one of my own, but I'm too old, I'm sterile, and finding someone is a minefield of problems I've dealt with one too many times and I don't think I can trust anyone again. As far as romance is concerned, being in between is being nowhere at all.


This is the shit people don't want to talk about. It's easy to reduce someone to an object, an abstract. It's easy to make it political. Too easy. We even do it to ourselves, with the best intentions. It's the greatest trick of modern society that we're all individuals, and we've got freedom, and we're just so star spangled awesome -- just don't hug. Don't make eye contact. This is a country where we made corporations people years before we were willing to legally recognize gay people as human beings. Yeah, I got marriage -- and I'm still waiting for a pot to piss in. Love wins, but it better hope it can hold it until it's home! God bless freedom, God bless America, and god fucking dammit I have to pee.


I am angry and scared all the time. I hate myself for not being strong enough to just deal with it and push forward. Finish this journey. I am so far in the weeds, so lost. I'm looking for a home I've never known. I've dealt with abuse, self-harm, there's not a single particle, not a shred of my life that this doesn't touch and what's left of me is just a mass of scar tissue inside and out. Other people fight for their ideals, or to get back what they had. Me? I'm fighting because I don't know how to do anything else.


But tell me your opinion one more time. How you're the victim. Or how you're trying to help. Either way just keep talking, don't even stop to inhale, because otherwise you might accidentally listen and feel something that isn't in your playbook. And my wouldn't that be uncomfortable. And because I'm nice, but mostly because it's easier for me too, I won't say anything. I won't tell you any of this. And after awhile I'm not sure what's real anymore, and I don't really care, just please keep talking because it's better than being alone. I might not be a person when I'm with you but at least I'm not alone with myself. It's dying the death of a thousand paper cuts.


It sounds bad. It is bad. None of this should be happening, but it has, it is. But there's something else going on underneath it all. I still keep reaching up. I don't even know why anymore. 


I see someone who looks stressed, or sad, and I say hello, listen, give them a hug. I tell my mom I love her because I do, however complicated it is. I stop and pickup the discarded trash on the roads around work, not because I want to instagram it but because me and the trash have an accord. I'm still fighting the hatred and discomforting quiet of others. Even though to many of them I'm no different than the cigarette butts and fast food wrappers balled up in my fists. And the world is a little better for it.


A friend comes home and she's busted up about her boy. Asks me to cuddle her awhile. She falls asleep. Then she wakes up, rolls over, and sobs into my arms. And I just hold her, and rub her hair again, until she falls asleep. I don't know what I'm doing, I just remember all the nights alone growing up when I put my arms around myself and imagined someone holding me. I don't ask for myself, and nobody's going to do it to me. And it doesn't matter. The world is a little better for it.


I'm so scared every time I walk out the front door. My finger stops over the dial button and I just... can't... make it touch. And that night I'll lay in bed and rip myself to pieces because it's just another wasted day where I could have done something, but no. I was too pathetic again. So I get up, I login, chat with people and touch a life a world away, and they message me back: ""Thank you."" Now I can sleep. The world is a little better for it. 


I see the scars and deepening lines in a face. I see anger and fear in eyes that aren't mine. I see I have destroyed a life to live in the reflections passing by. I did not choose this. If someone came now who could make it all go away I would drop like a beggar. Please, I would ask -- please take me away from this world. I have prayed, and cried, and screamed, and endured because I had no choice. But how else could I worship this world I am trying so hard to love? 


Yes, I am ashamed. I'm ashamed because of what I've had to do, what I've had to become, to survive in this world. I'm ashamed to love a world like this. I don't want to be a judge. I don't know who's right. Certainly not me. They tell me be a man. They tell me be a woman. They tell me it's a choice, or that it's not a choice. I've believed both. And neither. I've tried to reason with it, come to terms with it, only to find it's still there. 


I remember in school once asking what fire was; A solid, liquid, or gas? I was told it wasn't any of those things; It was something that happens to something else -- A force of nature. That's what it feels like. I'm something that *happens* to other people.",genderqueer,"Anatomy of a culture war (TW: violence, abuse)",1559275245.0,"{'created_utc': 1559250045, 'id': 'buyhnx', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 12, 'selftext': 'Today a story bubbled up out of T_D about a gender fluid school shooter, which made it to /r/all before getting deleted because the headline was misleading. Claims of a coverup now abound. Last week they closed a school because some 12 year old trans kid was a victim of a witchhunt. They were going to kill that child. Silence. The week before some asshat with alphabet soup at the end of his name got banned off Twitter and a bunch of people lost their minds; A doctor trying to weave a narrative that supported transphobic views with a bunch of half-truths and pseudo-intellectual crap. People cried censorship and ignored what happened when they didn\'t put a lid on this shit last time; Antivaxxers and a literal plague. He\'s still out there practicing medicine. \n\n\nThe week before that -- you know what, it\'s every week. It\'s been every week for years now. Imagine a boot stomping someone in the cunt every week forever. That\'s me. I\'m under that boot. Society has gotten ugly, and it\'s violent, and every last one of them believe they\'re on the right side of justice, god, logic, or... whatever. I don\'t want to be right -- I just want to stop getting kicked. There are no sides in this war I want to be on. \n\n\nPeople on the left (I\'ll get to the right too -- I\'m eo/aa/omgwtfbbq) are all about raising awareness, inclusiveness, and tolerance. Which is fine and dandy up to the part where they\'re so open minded they actually believe there\'s a million genders, think putting \'preferred pronouns\' on our introduction name tags is thoughtful instead of horrifyingly deaf, and get so busy virtue signaling with each other they fail to notice. I\'ve actually had them correct me -- on how to refer to myself, or tell me how to think about myself. I get told all the time I shouldn\'t be friends with people who don\'t ""accept you for who you are"" -- as if they have any business telling me who I get to associate with. How is that inclusive? I can respect the intention -- but not the result. \n\n\nNot to be outdone, I\'m a punching bag for the right. All of us are little anti-christs running around murdering and pillaging decent society with our wicked queer ways. We\'re what they point to when they spit and say ""political correctness."" We\'re the punchline for the big bad ""liberal"" agenda, and they will unload dump trucks full of bullshit they think is ""logic"". It\'s half-baked verbal diarrhea about chromosomes and biology and no matter how many arguments are demolished they\'ve got another lined up fresh from the vast ghetto of social fucking media. \n\n\nIt\'s all just rationalizing deeply felt anxieties about the future, the unknown, ""those people"". They live in constant fear, all their media screams and gushes out fear. Their amygdala has a taser shoved in it. They think facts and truth are discovered once, and then need never be investigated again. Yet they\'ll believe a screaming fat guy pushing herbal remedies talking about how the government is turning the frogs gay. Or tell us not to ""flaunt"" our gayness when we wear a rainbow pin as they drive by in their jacked up coal burner with a ten foot wide American flag stapled to its ass, two silhouettes of women in bikinis stuck to the back window, and red white and blue truck balls. Facts and logic though, right? Free speech but only in the comfortable, designated areas picked far out of view. \n\n\nThe two sides both point the finger at each other; All *I\'m* getting is the finger. \n\n\nEveryday I wake up and open up my dresser and I make a choice about how much I want to be abused. Wear jeans and a t-shirt and I\'m a guy until people are standing next to me in line and notice the bra lines. Wear a dress and I\'m the tranny and parents try to awkwardly shovel their kids out of the aisle when all I\'m there for is some flavor of ramen. But don\'t worry -- they all like Ellen on TV and have a gay neighbor so it\'s cool, right? \n\n\nI have my breakfast -- a handful of pills and that\'s usually it. I go to the grocery store about once a month maybe and I\'ve lost over 50 pounds in the last year because it\'s easier to just not eat than deal with people. That\'s not the only reason though -- I work in a restaurant, it\'s just I\'m so anxious all the time I don\'t have an appetite and can\'t eat more than a handful of anything at a time or it\'s a visit to the porcelain goddess. \n\n\nAnd I know it\'s a problem -- the doctors just turn me away and tell me it\'s a problem best solved in therapy. I\'ve already got another pointless appointment for next week to tell another one I\'m actually totally fine and nothing is wrong... I\'m just here to generate revenue. You want to know what queer people talk about after group therapy is over and the therapists leave? It\'s how to lie to them to jump through all the hoops. It\'s insane that so many people have to lie to fit into a narrative about them that grew up out of the culture of 40 years ago and expected to do that in the culture of today. And ironically, it\'s considered socially *progressive* they get treated at all.\n\n\nHundreds of experts with degrees and piles of studies and books in little rooms all over America are so utterly divorced from the reality of what their patients are going through it\'s heartbreaking. For a lot of people, ""do no harm"" may as well be ""do nothing at all"". The sad truth is, they\'re scared of the general public too. Scared they\'ll be sued, or arrested -- and I\'m not gonna sit here and tell them they should be brave and do what is necessary when I\'m locking myself in gas station bathrooms and passing out facing the same shit.\n\n\nThe doctor\'s office has become a political office where they prescribe thoughts and prayers instead of medicine for too many people. I don\'t know anyone I haven\'t had to say ""You just gotta keep trying until you find someone who gets it."" Honestly... a lot of people just give up and live in misery until depression catches up to them and they check out. Oh, it\'s so sad, but you know, there was nothing anyone could do. Except, you know, treat them as patients... or even just human beings. \n\n\nI go to work and I see the men talking with the men, and the women with the women, and nobody\'s talking to me because I\'m not really either to them. Oh, they\'re polite, it\'s just that everyone is more comfortable with me not existing so I quite conveniently went ahead and did that. It\'s nice when people remember the right pronouns, but speaking for myself it doesn\'t mean a whole lot if nobody\'s comfortable enough to actually talk to me. I mean, I can start conversations with them but the reverse doesn\'t happen. I make friends with people -- they don\'t make friends with me. Almost nobody initiates. That\'s the daily reality of this culture war. And even within our community, we\'re often too uncomfortable with each other because there\'s no scripts to follow.\n\n\nAn endless war\n_________\n\n\n\nDriving home it\'s just the music cranked up and stuffing the memories. Mom still can\'t say \'daughter\' after fuck-all years but progress because now I\'m just the ""older child"", ""sibling"", or whatever. She calls once every few weeks to see if I\'m still alive, say she loves me. Offers to help with the job search with a few bucks for a certification. Forgets she tried charging rent and said she wouldn\'t help with college after I came out. Forgets she\'s gone back on pretty much every promise she\'s made. Like everyone else. I tell her I love her too and hangup the phone, because against my better judgement every day I still want a family. And I wish I could have one of my own, but I\'m too old, I\'m sterile, and finding someone is a minefield of problems I\'ve dealt with one too many times and I don\'t think I can trust anyone again. As far as romance is concerned, being in between is being nowhere at all.\n\n\nThis is the shit people don\'t want to talk about. It\'s easy to reduce someone to an object, an abstract. It\'s easy to make it political. Too easy. We even do it to ourselves, with the best intentions. It\'s the greatest trick of modern society that we\'re all individuals, and we\'ve got freedom, and we\'re just so star spangled awesome -- just don\'t hug. Don\'t make eye contact. This is a country where we made corporations people years before we were willing to legally recognize gay people as human beings. Yeah, I got marriage -- and I\'m still waiting for a pot to piss in. Love wins, but it better hope it can hold it until it\'s home! God bless freedom, God bless America, and god fucking dammit I have to pee.\n\n\nI am angry and scared all the time. I hate myself for not being strong enough to just deal with it and push forward. Finish this journey. I am so far in the weeds, so lost. I\'m looking for a home I\'ve never known. I\'ve dealt with abuse, self-harm, there\'s not a single particle, not a shred of my life that this doesn\'t touch and what\'s left of me is just a mass of scar tissue inside and out. Other people fight for their ideals, or to get back what they had. Me? I\'m fighting because I don\'t know how to do anything else.\n\n\nBut tell me your opinion one more time. How you\'re the victim. Or how you\'re trying to help. Either way just keep talking, don\'t even stop to inhale, because otherwise you might accidentally listen and feel something that isn\'t in your playbook. And my wouldn\'t that be uncomfortable. And because I\'m nice, but mostly because it\'s easier for me too, I won\'t say anything. I won\'t tell you any of this. And after awhile I\'m not sure what\'s real anymore, and I don\'t really care, just please keep talking because it\'s better than being alone. I might not be a person when I\'m with you but at least I\'m not alone with myself. It\'s dying the death of a thousand paper cuts.\n\n\nIt sounds bad. It is bad. None of this should be happening, but it has, it is. But there\'s something else going on underneath it all. I still keep reaching up. I don\'t even know why anymore. \n\n\nI see someone who looks stressed, or sad, and I say hello, listen, give them a hug. I tell my mom I love her because I do, however complicated it is. I stop and pickup the discarded trash on the roads around work, not because I want to instagram it but because me and the trash have an accord. I\'m still fighting the hatred and discomforting quiet of others. Even though to many of them I\'m no different than the cigarette butts and fast food wrappers balled up in my fists. And the world is a little better for it.\n\n\nA friend comes home and she\'s busted up about her boy. Asks me to cuddle her awhile. She falls asleep. Then she wakes up, rolls over, and sobs into my arms. And I just hold her, and rub her hair again, until she falls asleep. I don\'t know what I\'m doing, I just remember all the nights alone growing up when I put my arms around myself and imagined someone holding me. I don\'t ask for myself, and nobody\'s going to do it to me. And it doesn\'t matter. The world is a little better for it.\n\n\nI\'m so scared every time I walk out the front door. My finger stops over the dial button and I just... can\'t... make it touch. And that night I\'ll lay in bed and rip myself to pieces because it\'s just another wasted day where I could have done something, but no. I was too pathetic again. So I get up, I login, chat with people and touch a life a world away, and they message me back: ""Thank you."" Now I can sleep.

4,2019-05-01 11:58:18,bjg8i1,2,6,"I have struggled with my gender identity since I was 11 years old. I came out very early as a trans guy and had to fight hard to get other people (especially my family) to listen to me and take me seriously. I was very dysphoric since the beginning of my puberty and was 100% sure that I want to transition when I'm old enough to make that decision myself, because my parents wouldn't let me.
But... I think... three years after coming out I discovered I also had a ""feminine side"" and it confused me alot. Most of the time I'm still pretty sure that I want to go on T. But when I have one of those ""feminine days"" I kind of think different about it. It doesn't seem necessary then. And I think I'll never be able to make that decision, because my opinion keeps changing, the feminine days will always come back, just like the masculine days will do. I'm almost 20 years old and I could've went on hormones since 2016, but I never went to the doctor again because I was scared to make the wrong decision.
I also feel like I can't open up to anyone because I fought hard to be accepted as a trans guy and I don't want to destroy it and hear things like ""I knew it was a phase"" from them.
I should mention that, even though I have those fem days, I NEVER wear feminine clothing. I don't even own feminine clothing. But I wish I would. I wish I could experiment with my gender without being judged by my family or friends.
I've grown my hair out, it's now below my shoulders and my therapist asked me if I still want to be called by male pronouns. It made me very insecure. Now I'm thinking about cutting my hair short again because on male days it makes me dysphoric as hell and it feels like it does make me invalid as a guy.

I came out very early as a trans guy and had to fight hard to get other people (especially my family) to listen to me and take me seriously. I was very dysphoric since the beginning of my puberty and was 100% sure that I want to transition when I\'m old enough to make that decision myself, because my parents wouldn\'t let me.\nBut... I think... three years after coming out I discovered I also had a ""feminine side"" and it confused me alot. Most of the time I\'m still pretty sure that I want to go on T. But when I have one of those ""feminine days"" I kind of think different about it. It doesn\'t seem necessary then. And I think I\'ll never be able to make that decision, because my opinion keeps changing, the feminine days will always come back, just like the masculine days will do. I\'m almost 20 years old and I could\'ve went on hormones since 2016, but I never went to the doctor again because I was scared to make the wrong decision.\nI also feel like I can\'t open up to anyone because I fought hard to be accepted as a trans guy and I don\'t want to destroy it and hear things like ""I knew it was a phase"" from them.\nI should mention that, even though I have those fem days, I NEVER wear feminine clothing. I don\'t even own feminine clothing. But I wish I would. I wish I could experiment with my gender without being judged by my family or friends.\nI\'ve grown my hair out, it\'s now below my shoulders and my therapist asked me if I still want to be called by male pronouns. It made me very insecure. Now I\'m thinking about cutting my hair short again because on male days it makes me dysphoric as hell and it feels like it does make me invalid as a guy.

I'm a 31 AMAB who has always been mistaken for being gay because I have very feminine traits.
I never really considered it a thing when people said it because I was raised by my mother and aunts mostly and figured it's just what I learned growing up.

But recently after doing a lot of soul searching I've come to realise that I don't really consider myself to be Male all the time. I like to dress feminine sometimes and enjoy learning just being one of the girls. I've talked with a couple of friends and they believe that maybe I'm gender fluid because sometimes I'm ok with being a Male and others I would like to be considered female.

I'm just confused about it all and was hoping someone would be able to help put me on the right path.

29,2019-05-06 03:16:52,bl6ujf,4,8,"So before we start, I identify as gender fluid (still not completely sure but labels comfort me), my pronouns are they/them  110% of the time, and my mom is 100000% supportive of the lgbt community. I've already come out to her briefly liking girls, boys and everyone in-between, just forgot to tell her the actual terminology (dunno how that happened). Also another thing: I'm sorry for the terrible formatting and over-all writing, I don't write that much and my English kind of sucks even though I was born and raised speaking English. I'm also sorry if this seems rushed because I'm kind of in an anxious mood right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on... I feel the need to have a binder. I haven't spoken to my mother about my gender identity at all. I think she knows what gender fluid is?? But to confirm she does at least know what pronouns are, here's a super fast story: I was doing something for English class and we had to do an about the author page. I used they/them pronouns for myself and she asked me about it, I panicked and said that I was still she/her and now my chances are probably ruined but ya know I'm still going to try.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory on my mom: She's super kind, caring, and a bit strict, but she just wants the best for me.

Hello,

Just to give a bit of context, I am in my early thirties, AFAB, and not identifying as a genderqueer or trans person yet, although I am questioning. I am very androgynous and get called both ‚ÄúSir‚Äù and ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam‚Äù a lot. I usually dress on the androgynous-masculine side of the spectrum, with the odd day where I‚Äôll go ultra-feminine or genderfuck. 

I‚Äôve recently been invited to a wedding and I‚Äôd like to take advantage of the occasion to buy some formal wear that reflects my current gender expression. That would mean a nice suit. I don‚Äôt have a hard time finding casual masculine clothes in my size, but when it comes to formal wear, it‚Äôs another story. Usually, the shoulders will be way too broad, or the trousers too tight around the hips. Suits designed for women generally fit but are too subtly feminine for my taste.

I am small (5‚Äô4, 115 lbs), athletic, with a mostly flat chest but narrow shoulders and wide hips. Does anyone know where I‚Äôd be able to find wedding-appropriate masculine clothes that might fit smaller and more femininely-built people like me with minimal tailoring? I‚Äôve been recommended Brooks Brothers, but I live in Canada and we don‚Äôt have them around, unfortunately. I am fortunate enough to be in a decent position, finance-wise, so I can afford to invest in a nice suit.

Hi...so I'm newly growing my very short hair out for the first time (amab) and I would like some advice as to what to do with my back edges &amp; sideburns in the meanwhile during the weird inbetween growing out process. I want to keep it tidy, but also want to grow out some length eventually. I've always had really tight fades &amp; bro-cuts previously, so this is all new to me. I'm not even at pixie cut length yet but I'm determined to let it grow the rest of the year at least. Any insight or advice would be much appreciated.

Also: Side question. What are your thoughts on sideburns being sign of expressing masc features? I tried trimming mine really high to see how it looked and it's looks weird.

I spend many years in denial, really scared of any kind of femininity yet at the same time often had thoughts of being female, in both normal and sexual ways which I told no one, I was quite insecure about being paired with anything female, literally never shaved cuz of that reason too, and my insecurity was quite obvious to my best friend since he did notice like some areas about that felt like he touched a nerve so wasn‚Äôt even surprised when I told him.

The thing is at the start I obsessed over passing, like I thought I wanted to look fully female(mostly face/body wise since I despise make up and most female clothing since it‚Äôs all revealing and tight), but now after around 6 months of hrt I started liking my appearance, which rly isn‚Äôt very female yet in a way I‚Äôm ‚Äòsatisfied‚Äô

Like can be confused for a woman from the sides due to my long hair or from far away which I had before anyway, but pretty much everywhere we would go with my (gay male) friend on our vacations ppl called us ‚Äòguys‚Äô, which I honestly never minded, randos opinions mean nothing to me really so never had this whole ‚Äòwaah they misgendered me thing‚Äô probably because I‚Äôm unsure of my own gender at this point. Though I do enjoy when my friend makes jokes about me being a woman(not sexual) or use female pronouns in private since he knows I lean more that way but I don‚Äôt want everyone to do that, it is like I feel fine being a weird male in public using my chosen male name and keep that other side as something more ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô

So in general, I kinda look like a fat guy with long hair and somewhat feminine face that is pretty male from the front, body is pretty chubby so boobs can probably pass as moobs outside and I wouldn‚Äôt mind having the bottom surgery since I always disliked having a penis since it always felt so wrong and useless but that is a far away dream now so I need the money for other stuff rn. I pretty much look like a rly weird somewhat female looking guy that acts like a gay bottom which I technically still am I guess?

I rly have absolutely no idea where I fit in label wise, I‚Äôm definitely not a normal trans woman since I dislike any kind of female clothing, mannerisms and don‚Äôt want anyone but my rly close friend know I lean towards there but not that much, I honestly feel more something in between now so I‚Äôm rly unsure if I would count as non binary or something else.

242,2019-05-30 22:59:50,buztay,5,25,"So I finally found a name that sings to me.  

During my gender journey I learned a ton about myself.  I started life AMAB.    Egg cracked in my teens and discovered I definitely am not male nor do I prefer masculinity.  I identified as a girl because I had some body gender dysphoria.  I didn‚Äôt grow boobs during puberty.   I still want them to this day.  I had some downstairs dysphoria too but that was not as strong as my lack of breasts dysphoria.

I also learned that I love femininity.   I also felt restricted with masculinity.   

So I tried out different female names online and in public.   Such as Jessica and /u/_AmyChristine_.   While I did feel euphoria when called one of these names, I never bonded with them.  

So most of my life I was identifying as transgender female but I recently discovered a new aspect of my identity.   I do identify as male in some situations but that is not consistent and not constant.   However my identity as female is consistent but fluctuates.  

So I sought after a name that represented this aspect of my identity.   I found the name Riley.   Fell in love with and bonded to this name.  I am a Riley.   But I was lacking a middle name.  

I learned that Riley started out as a masculine male name that transitioned to one of the most popular unisex names.   

So tried /u/RileyChristine and felt it was too feminine and not fluid enough.  

I the tried /u/RileyCadence.  Loved the
Meaning and was unisex enough but just wasn‚Äôt right.   

I still identify as transgender but also as gender fluid.   

Now I am Riley Kendall &lt;insert last name here&gt;.   

I learned that Kendall also started out as a boys name.  

So putting them together sounds very pretty and feminine while technically and historically masculine.   

So the search is over.   Now to come out as gender fluid and start using this name everywhere.

243,2019-05-31 01:34:25,bv1f5a,3,7,"Long post warning!

So my whole life I have identified as male, but I have always had female tendencies. When I was in adolescence I would always throw my moms clothing on and walk around. I was always met with laughs as I was always the funny guy and it was me just ‚Äúmessing around‚Äù. My sister and I would play games together and my favorite was the game, Pretty Pretty Princess. I loved winning and being able to put on the tiara and call myself the Princess. I have had fleeting thoughts about my sexuality and my identity more recently and it has been very disheartening. I have always been this ‚Äúbig guy‚Äù and people see me as this tough man but I feel so feminine compared to the outlook of others. 

Brining this full circle, today at work a coworker was talking to me and asked me a question, ‚Äúhow do you identify?‚Äù

I was not prepared for this question at all because it is one that I have avoided myself, and have not put much thought to my response. I quickly responded, ‚Äúmale‚Äù and now I question that my response is really how I feel.

My (f)ianc√© and I have had discussions about this subject matter. She has told me that I am who I am and that is okay. But the issue is, is that I don‚Äôt know who I am! 

I am just looking for some tips on how you guys have worked thru these identity crisis‚Äô and how fluid this whole gender thing is!

244,2019-05-31 01:55:36,bv1n4p,4,7,"Hi all! I am AFAB. 24 years old and living like a female my entire life. Well, kind of. I was never into traditionally ""girly"" things growing up, or even really now. I didn't wear dresses, didn't seek out makeup and cute clothes, never did anything with my hair. Nothing. Didn't even care about dolls. I liked playing outside and wearing big shirts. Hated tight clothes and all that jazz. It's how I lived. As a girl. And I never really thought twice about it.

Late last year, my husband told me that he thinks that he's transgender and feels like a female. Okay cool no problem, let's work through this. I've been supporting him (yes, still him, he's not quite there with the pronouns yet). While talking about all this with him, I figured out that I feel some of the same feelings as he does.

I have breasts that I wish were slightly smaller just to where I don't need a bra (I'm not enormous by any means, I'd just like them a bit smaller). But I don't feel like they don't belong. I have no real issue with my plumbing down there, other than having periods. A penis isn't super appealing, but pretending could be fun. I like my girly underwear as much as my boxers. I just bought a dress that I love, but I'm not super confident in it. I love my more masculine clothing as well. Still don't have an interest in makeup or doing my hair other than trying a bit of color. I don't hate my very feminine name, but also sometimes wished it was more neutral. I don't really want body hair, but still hate shaving. None of this stuff is super off putting too me. I have days where I just want to wear boxers and have really short hair, but there's other days where I'm completely content in my girl body.

And my husband told me I might be nonbinary. Please don't take offense, but I'm not super fond of the term. To me, binary is ones and zeros and if you're nonbinary, in my head, you can't have parts of either. So here I am at gender fluid. I'm also okay with gender queer I think, though I'm still learning all the terms and stuff.

My husband and I both attend therapy separately, and this is something that we talk about openly. We're planning on attending some of the gender community meetings when my schedule changes (our region has great support for this stuff).

I think the weird thing about all this is that I'm not feeling the need to come out or hide anything from anyone. If anything, I'm hiding the more outwardly feminine stuff, because I'm not confident. But if people find out that I'm fluid, I really don't care.

How did you all come to find out that you're gender fluid? What are some things that you wear or do to present all genders (I'm wearing boxers with my nails painted right now). What's your favorite thing about being fluid? How did you build your confidence?
