To make matters worse none of my co-workers know I'm NB. I've read that many women feign interest whenever a guy is talking at them just because it's easier and safer for them, so I can't imagine how insufferable I must be.

I come from a homophobic and transphobic family, though they are trying to learn to be less homophobic it isn't doing so great... I am pansexual (female/feminine leaning) and bigender. I told my mom I like girls but she keeps on insisting it's ""just a phase"" though I'm practically adult now (turning 18 on the 3rd). I get adults can be confused on who they are still, but I know I'm not confused. They also insist my trans girlfriend is confused since she's around my age group. I love my family dearly but when I hear some of the phobic things they say...it gets to me.  


 I also went to a Christian private school for three years. All of the standards I had to meet are just insane, but it was worse for the guys I am sure. Here's a few things I remember: Guys couldn't have hair go past their ears, they had to wear a belt, and if they were friends with a girl, they had to be monitored. Girls had to be monitored if they had guy friends as well. There was a ""six inch rule"" that had to be followed as well, which meant no hugs, fist bumps, or high fives, even if it is same sex. Also that time I forgot to wear a skirt for the morning we were going to a convention i was forced to go to (principal was a nutjob who thought my actually diagnosed by a doctor anxiety was fake and was used to get out of doing things) so in my comfy khaki slacks that girls were allowed to wear during normal school days (thank god) I was forced to change into a skirt while we stopped at a Zaxby's in the restaurant's bathroom, and all of my classmates saw me enter and leave the bathrooms...I felt so ashamed... The whole five days were bad, but could have been worse. I got only five hours of sleep each day and we weren't allowed naps. I couldn't eat or else I'd anxiety gag and puke everywhere, so I was hungry and tired. I also had to suppress my sexuality in order to even stay there. So due to this, I still have bouts of internal homophobia and cringe at gay males specifically. I don't want to treat these people any different, I still love them as I'd love any stranger but I have to shove away my teachings. Same school almost expelled a ""Principal's Pet"" due to him being gay, he only stayed due to him almost graduating. I felt bad for him, even though he bullied me.

After starting T, I thought I would find a better fit in the ftm crowd (all super rad people!), but the fit still wasn't quite right.

Another somewhat dysphoria-inducing thing I caught myself doing is not correcting people who use he/him pronouns for me.

I'm also struggling with feeling ""invisible"" again since most people (queer or not) read me as a cis man. Before T, this wasn't really an issue since my voice gave me away. I find myself needing to prove why I have a place in queer spaces, similar to how bi/pan friends in heterosexual-appearing relationships are treated. I knew conceptually that the changes caused by T would lead to a changed public perception, but dealing with this in practice has proved more difficult than I first thought.

For a few months, now, I've been increasingly feeling like I want breasts, to put it simply. I've done crossdressing and a LOT of drag and this definitely doesn't feel the same.

I'm currently seeing a therapist about these feelings, but I'm also looking for more resources.

So I suppose I'm asking if anyone has experience in this sort of arena?

Alright gamers (just a heads up, I don't speak like this normally, apologies if it's annoying, but it's what I do in these moments), so basically I've identified as enby for a while, but it hasn't really felt 100% right. Agender has been pretty close for me, so I've went with that for the past while. My one friend I'm out to knows me as agender, using they/them pronouns. 

But, here's the catch: sometimes I just get hit with waves of full-on boy moods, like I'm 100% male (I'm AFAB btw). But, sometimes I'm just kinda androgynous inside, and most of the time I relate to the general definition of agender. So, basically, I have fuck all clues as to whether I'm agender or male. And no, I don't feel lika a demiguy. It's either one or the other, not a mix of both. My closest explanation would be that I'm fluid between male and agender (but that sounds stupid because agender means you don't have a gender, even if that's literally how I feel).

But also, most of the time I don't 100% relate to the trans guy experiences, and my brain is all like ""Hmm that doesn't really feel like you either"". Am I just an abomination or something? Idk.

**in short, fem=short for feminine (a catch-all aesthetic descriptor), femme=largely lesbian specific identity (a unique identity with a complex relationship to femininity that i, as a non-lesbian, feel unqualified to talk now)**

as an example, i am transfeminine nonbinary, so i use the word fem to describe my presentation and relationship to gender. however i do not identify as a lesbian, so i do not use the word femme, and it would be inappropriate for me to do so.

now this isn't to say there can't be femme enbies, i know several nonbinary lesbians, some of which identify with the femme label, but folks, please try not to use femme when when you mean fem. we, of all communities, should understand the importance of labels to marginalized and largely erased people, and how it can hurt to have them weakened through misuse

if i recall correctly there is another use of femme that's related to the black gay culture and the ball scene, and if anyone knows more about that particular identity i'd love to hear the intricacies thereof, because that's unfortunately an aspect of lgbt+ history i'm pretty ill informed about. but odds are damn good for most of y'all that if you're not a lesbian, you mean fem, not femme

again, i fully admit that as a white non-lesbian i'm about as unqualified to educate about either femme identity as possible, but i've seen how much this misuse hurts our lesbian siblings, and nobody else seemed to be speaking up, so i figured better me than nobody

&gt;!So I recently just started TA'ing in college. There is a person in my class who I noticed on the first day looked androgynous but I didn't need to use pronouns that day so I just moved on. This week I noticed a button on their backpack which I didn't recognize. I looked it up and it's the non-binary flag, which is why I've come here. Its been a couple weeks and I still haven't needed to use any pronouns for them, but I am growing concerned I may need to at some point and would really like to provide a safe environment for them by using the correct ones. I recognize that I am assuming a lot based off my little information, and the student has not come to me and said they are non-binary so all I have is my own personal observations and a button, which is definitely wrong to make an assumption off of. However I just don't know what the correct way of approaching this is and really want to create as positive and safe of an environment in class as possible. !&lt;

&gt;!So my question is two fold. Is it ok to (in a private setting) ask the student if they are non-binary and have preferred pronouns? And if yes, how should I do it? Should I mention that I saw the button and looked it up and am curious if they are non-binary and if so do they have preferred pronouns? Should I wait for them to come to me first? I noticed from looking through the archive that people have liked having a paper passed around on the first day of class asking for this information, which I'd love to try next semester but I don't have time in class anymore to do that now that the semester is in full swing.

From dnd elven translator found on lingojam Aunt = Os'Nys &amp; Uncle = Os'Tan so:

Os, Oso, Nystan, or Tannys

From a draconic translator on twilightrealm.com Aunt = Yavsis &amp; Uncle = Iosta so:

Yio, Yiyi Yios, Yata, Sisio, Sisios, Yavios, Yavi, Iosis, Taya, or Stasis

Enbu (from enby)

Ranbu (from rainbow, kinda sounds like rainbow, but isn't actually rainbow)

Menu (like menoo), Meni, Versi, Verso, Versu, Maru, Marus, or Mari (all combinations of Venus and Mars, the male/female symbols)

Feso (a bit of a stretch, but the androgyny symbol also happens to symbolize iron sulfate, the formula of which is FeSO4)

Orchid, orchu (orku), orcho (orko), orcha (orka) (from the intersex symbol of orchid)

Neutro, Neuta or Neutra (from neutrois)

Demi or Demu (like demigender)

Mahu or mahi (from the Hawaiian term of mahu for nonbinary people)

Xi, Xixi, Xeni, or Xo (from xenogender)

Some of the draconian ones may be a tad difficult for a child to call you but I think everything else is a good option.

The girls are sparkly and shit, and the boys are blocky and cover differently. I usually wear 'girls' practice stuff, but you can pick ones that are more plain and don't have sparkles \n\nThis year I asked if I could order the guys uniform. Two coaches said yes (one was fine with me competing in it, the other was at least okay with me ordering it). Third coach came back later and said no. Some bs reason about the guys needing their own identity (I am not out to coaches, kind of to teammates, and none of them care).\n\nI'm still waiting to find out from the officials for our region whether I would even be allowed to wear the boys uniform, but I am not happy.\n\nDoes anyone else play sports with gendered uniforms? How do you deal? Ours keep getting more and more sparkly and femmy and I just can't. I will, because I live the sport, but it makes me kinda dysphoric and I hate it."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Sports uniforms', 'created': 1570273270.0}"

Hello guys! Just-became-17-year-old AFAB here. All my life (from the age of 10 to 16-ish) I've had no idea of gender and considered myself a closeted lesbian (I'm out to a select number of friends as a lesbian). However for quite a few months, somehow I feel that ""girl"" does not entirely fit me, neither does ""boy"". I do mostly feel girly a lot - even yesterday I wore a new dress which I loved, but today I felt uncomfortable when my sis suggested me to wear a skirt - it just felt wrong. Also, I feel like a girl when I am with my girl friends, but when I see boys laughing, fighting and playing pranks on each others, I feel like jumping into the fun with them - I literally think inside my head, ""Looks like the boy in me is bouta have some fun..."". I also feel like no gender, for example, I think, ""Fuck gender, I'm just a living, breathing, fucking (not literally) human"".In short, I always feel like a homogeneous mixture of boy, girl and agender, with girl feeling most prominent, then agender. 

Now coming to pronouns, first of all my mother tongue (Bengali) is completely gender neutral, which has an astounding YAS from me. However, I often have to converse in English, and nowadays I feel more comfortable thinking of myself in gender neutral terms (like person instead of girl, child instead of daughter, they instead of she). However, in my country (India), most people don't even understand L, G, B, or T people, let alone enby folks. I myself have to admit  that I understood how people can become trans only like six months ago. Two months ago, I tried telling two of my closest, most supportive friends that I felt like both boy and girl. Result? They thought that non-binary meant bisexual and thought I was changing my sexual orientation from lesbian to bi **facepalm**. Now if they don't understand, I'm sure no one will. Also, they were saying something to the effect that how vould I like only one gender if I say I myself am not one gender. I thought that if the concept of more than two genders confuses them, then the the fact sexual orientation is completely different from gender orientation will pass 100 km over their heads, so I said nothing.

So, here is the case. It turned out too long I'm afraid. I just want to know if there is a gender which fits me (girlflux is close, but still feels not quite right). Also, how can I educate my friends about gender? Coming out twice feels embarrassing to me.

I am straight (aka I like woman) and have been called man my whole life. I'm 16 and have never dated with anyone so a couple of my friends semi jokingly asked if I was gay or maybe even asexual (I'm not).

I've never felt that manly, and I never really cared. I used to be the quiet kid, then the weird kid and now... who the hell knows. I also never felt feminine in any way. I don't want to be called a she or even a they, but I started questioning some stuff recently because I noticed something.

Essentially I feel like a man and sometimes I feel like I am non-binary with male pronouns. So being a demiguy seemed perfect for me. One problem though. 

It seems to me all demiguys who I listened that talked about this are much more on the nonbinary side of being a demiguy (or even the feminine side).

So my question is, is there a more masuline version of a demiguy? Cause from what I see demiguys are much more non-binary than male, while I am the other way around. I thought maybe I am just a male that's not that masculine, and there's nothing wrong with that, but then again there's that part of me that feels nonbinary. Calling myself male doesn't feel fully right. It feels like it doesn't tell the whole story.

290,2019-10-06 02:43:27,ddxi49,6,45,"My sister got married today. In BFE Idaho, at an air b&amp;b with literally zero privacy. 

Now, I came out to my mom about 10 years ago. Since then, she kind of pretends that it‚Äôs not a thing. She asked me to wear a T-shirt dress (mind you, the high today was 40), I declined, and [wore this instead. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/oDGKtF9) (please ignore laundry). I wore it with a binder, and purposely did not bring anything else. I knew this would start a fight. 

The rest is snippets of the day, I hope they make sense. 

At the wedding, my mom pretended she didn‚Äôt see what I was wearing, which was almost worse. I‚Äôm already feeling pretty alienated, as most everyone here is from the grooms side, or their friends, and they live about 14 hours from me. 

Afterwards, while we were making dinner, My mom  told me that she didn‚Äôt like my wedding outfit, it made her uncomfortable and was not flattering on me. And to please wear something different for the reception. 

I said I was sorry if I made her uncomfortable, but she told me to wear what made me comfortable. And that I would probably wear something similar to the reception. Unless she wants me to not go. 

My mom then cornered me in the bathroom *while I was on the toilet* so that she could cry at me. I promptly told her to go away, and we could talk later. Eventually she left. 

I would have rather waited until not this weekend, but She decided she wanted to have this conversation now. I essentially came out again. She called me her daughter and then asked me why I had to put labels on it. And argued that daughter is not a label. 

She also tried to guilt me with things like, ‚ÄúI loved you every day, and did so much for you‚Äù I said multiple times this isn‚Äôt what it‚Äôs about. Literally stole the rent line ‚Äútake me for what I am, or leave me‚Äù

She told me that she didn‚Äôt like the way I was treating her. I told her I didn‚Äôt like the way she was treating me, and that was the end of that.

Later on, she interrupted my phone call from my supportive chosen family, and we had this lovely exchange:

Mom: you are my child, and I love you and accept you for who you are

Me; then show it. Actions speak louder than words

Mom: how?

Me: like not saying shit like you did today

Mom: I said I was sorry (aka get over it)

I am lucky that I do not live with her, nor am supported by her in any way shape, or form. She also lives about 9 hours from me. I am so lucky to have a supportive husband, chosen family, and in laws. 

My brother did tell me he liked my outfit a lot and what my mom said to me was wrong ‚Äúcause that‚Äôs just who you are, and that‚Äôs okay‚Äù. So I‚Äôve got that going for me too.

The problem is if I continue on lupron after 2 years there could be significant effects to my bone density. 

Essentially, now my choices are testosterone or birth control. Neither of which are ideal for me. 
Birth control wouldn‚Äôt completely stop my cycles which would absolutely suck. It would be like going backwards and it also wouldn‚Äôt continue to halt top growth.
However, I‚Äôm worried testosterone would ruin my androgyny.

So, i'm a person who likes to snoop. Terrible trait, I know. I found my sibling's phone one time and then I found their reddit. I am EXTREMELY embarrassed to admit that I then looked at all their posts. 

That's when I found out their an enby (that's not a derogatory term right? That's like a fun nickname for NB?). I kind of already knew that because of an earlier convo we've had, which I won't detail because they might realize this is me writing this if they see this post..... (im on an alt account). I do totally accept them. I don't like saying that, because ""accepting them"" feels like I'm implying they made a mistake or their wrong or something. I guess better wording would be I feel like ""oh okay, good for you!"". 

And I now I feel bad, because A) I invaded their privacy and B) they didn't feel safe enough to tell me. I'm trying not to take it personally, or maybe I should? I'm trying to think if I've ever been unaccepting. I'd like to say I've never said anything wrong, but honestly when I was 8-11 I didn't totally understand how someone could be trans or Non Binary. Nowadays, I respect everyone and supply everyone. You're gay? Let's find you a boyfriend! You're fluid? Whoo! 

Anyways,  I know that snooping was stupid and yah. I get that I prob shouldn't tell them I know, in case they're not ready and stuff. Are there any ways I can show them I support everything? Show them I'm accepting and all that without making them feel attacked?

So yah.

I think they've kind of come out to my parents, because they got 2 binders, but also I've (in my stupid snooping) seen posts by them saying how our parents are only half-supporting and not fully understanding.

Or it did.

My hair has been thinning for years, with an ever more obvious balding patch on the crown, and it's become impossible for me to ignore this patch anymore. I can't see it in the mirror but I can feel it and I see it whenever I'm in a store or fast food place that has cameras on the queue, and it's giving me more and more dysphoria.

Lately I'm feeling like my only real option is to get out the clippers again and go down to the short-short cut for good, or shave my head completely. Which would probably be my top choice, except it's only in the last couple of years that I've come out as a demigirl and really started to present more fem, I'm totally loving being able to embrace my fem side, and super-short hair is going to make me look totally cis male.

I'm not about high-maintenance hairstyles and really can't get away with the kind of ""enby do"" I see a lot of peeps here rocking, not to mention I'm very reluctant to pay the money for a fresh do every few months after going 50 years with home haircuts.

(Pic of me, recents, chameleon yes)

Hi, my name is Kimberly. 
I present myself as Kay.
I never resonated with the name Kimberly, more annoyingly, my last name is also Kim.
Long ever since as I remember, 1st grade. 
I've always wanted to change it.
As I grew older, I had to suck up being called Kimberly, or got called Kim,  anyways.  Always been too feminine and never felt like ""me"".
I then realized I am nonbinary, maybe less than a year ago. 
Even more reasons to change my name.
I still am not fully comfortable. It can be challenging fitting into a new world where you are finally you but it can be intimidating and frightening.
I asked my mom what other name she would have named me. She said father was going to put me as Emily. Strangely, I wanted that name as a child. But now , I found a name I got used to a whole year, Kay. 
I was thinking of names with the letter 'K' to make it more familiar.

Kay is nice but would like a fuller name.

Kayden , I like , but my hispanic family wouldn't know how to say it I believe. 

I like Evan, but sounds like Ivan,  very masculine in Spanish √âe van.
Not like how like it to sound, with a flatter ƒì. Hm..

Ivory is quite pretty too. Ivy for short.
But not soo sure ifs fitting since I lean towards more masculine on my daily days and personality/energy wise, even if I  can look or like to dress very feminizing in some days.

I would like a smooth sounding and elegant  pronouncing name, so far all those 3 have that taste in my opinion. 

From the look of my face, which is more suitable and hits home in your opinion?

Feel free for other suggestions with the letter E or K that is neutral or a tab bit more masculine.
I find it a bit strange to range out of the letter ""K"" , how can I find ways to make it ease into me ? Maybe doesnt matter soo much of the feminine or masculine vibes, right? Should be more of what sits with me. But I am having a hard time deciding and finding it.

I'm a longtime lurker who has decided to give posting a go!  
My partner is an avid redditor, who suggested that I practice the vulnerability I preach in my music and try to build some community here.

I want to share my latest single, that just dropped today. The song is called ""Worry,"" and was a way for me to process the dysfunctional ""relationship"" I have with my anxiety and mental illness. My music is heavily influenced by artists like Emmylou Harris, Brandi Carlile, and Stevie Nicks. Growing up, music felt like one of the mediums through which I could most ""safely"" explore my gender, and artists like Stevie Nicks, who played with notions of femininity vs. masculinity.... hard vs. soft.... etc etc, helped me to feel less alone.

However I am very hesitant to apply a label to myself if it is inappropriate, as I feel it can cheapen the journey of so many who have fought so hard to be heard.   So I was hoping to share my thinking and hopefully get some input from you all!   I will try to be concise, so if you would like more information feel free to ask. üòä 

AFAB- growing up It was challenging for me to figure out where I fit. I determined at an early age that I was bisexual (though I have come to realize that I am, and have always been pansexual) but in the environment I grew up in there was no awareness/acceptance of genders outside of male and female.  
 some days I would  present more masculine, shopping in the mens section, hiding my hair under a toque/hat and binding my breasts, and other days present more feminine: skirts makeup etc.  
I have had my hair very short and very long, but my typical presentation was hair pulled up. No makeup, and typically a mash up of whatever made me feel awesome that day, but generally avoiding masculine/feminine extremes.  These are patterns that I have followed my entire life.  The exception would be formal dress, where I typically always present as feminine.. since honestly it‚Äôs just easier not to have to explain, and a bit more fun. 

It has never overly troubled me to be 
misgendered as male or female, though at this point in my life I am most comfortable with the pronoun ‚Äúthey‚Äù. 

I have always accepted that how people saw my gender was based on my physical appearance, but psychologically I never let that determine what I was able to do or what I was interested in. I remember being devastated and confused when I wasnt allowed to go hunting with my dad, and was made to go into girl guides.  Most of my careers have been in male dominated fields. Most of my friends were male.  I just didn‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù. 

Then when I was pregnant and breastfeeding my children.  I was in awe and embraced it all fully.  I have never felt more powerful as a woman..

Now that I have passed that phase, I‚Äôm back to being generally just confused about how I fit....  when I‚Äôm not really comfortable both either.

I find myself to be very androgynous in my behavior and dress. But I have a very feminine physique. I have used tinder before to find some people but I feel like even when I tell them my situation and their understanding of it. There‚Äôs this explication or want for my to be more feminine.

I guess some good background would be I‚Äôm out to my friends my mom and my sister moms not very excepting. Also I have romantic intimacy issues and a fear of being emotionally or physically responsible for people‚Äôs well beings. And I‚Äôm a very out going person. I also went through a lot of gender dysphoria again this past year hasn‚Äôt really happened since high school. (Don‚Äôt know if this matters? But,I‚Äôm a Virgin)

There isn‚Äôt much research out there about the way transgender and nonbinary folks experience different body image issues (shocking, I know‚Ä¶). With this study, we‚Äôre hoping to change that. 

In this survey, you‚Äôll be asked to answer some multiple choice questions about your body image, as well as short-response questions regarding activities that impact your body image and what we in the psychology field can do to better understand and help trans and nonbinary people experiencing negative body image‚Äîand learn some tactics that promote positive body image too. 

Because this survey is about something very personal, I want to assure you that you will ***not*** be linked to your data at any time, and the survey will be completely anonymous. If anyone is interested, you can message me or my fellow researchers directly when the study is over, and we can share the results with you. 

And while helping further research is all well and good, there‚Äôs another incentive to participate; we‚Äôll be giving away one **$25 Amazon** gift card for every 25 participants (so 100 participants equals four cards). You‚Äôll need to provide your email to be entered in the drawing, but that will be in a separate survey form so that you remain anonymous. 

The survey itself will take between a half hour and an hour, depending on the depth of your answers and your typing speed. I would really appreciate It if you‚Äôd give it a shot, or send this post to a friend so they can know about it. 

Thank you all so much in advance, and I know that together we can help further our understanding of these issues and by doing so start to change the way people in our field think about our transgender and nonbinary siblings.

Are you a parent or prospective parent? Do you identify as non-binary, gender-nonconforming, genderqueer, and/or gender fluid? If so, you might be able to participate in a paid Harvard study examining the experiences of GNC parents. Confidentiality is guaranteed, and $20/hr compensation is provided for a casual interview.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals navigate their parent identity, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or cis gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.

If you are interested in participating, please email Principal Investigator Fernanda Baron (they, them, theirs) at [fbaron@college.harvard.edu](mailto:fbaron@college.harvard.edu) or call at 832-967-7411.",NonBinary,Harvard GNC Study,1570740426.0,"{'created_utc': 1570715226, 'id': 'dfy8um', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 3, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Study Information:](https://i.redd.it/zjuok9n6xpr31.jpg)\n\nAre you a parent or prospective parent?

I don't know what I am. I also hate that. I wish I was confident in my identity... And I wish more than anything that it wouldn't get me disowned. I thought about it in the shower last night and I think non-binary fits me the best. But now I am not sure since this happened. 

Being called a man or a woman is both really weird for me. I don't like either. I prefer they pronouns the most, but it still feels strange. I don't mind being called a boy or a girl, though. Boy is a bit more comfy but girl doesn't hurt that much. I do think I experience some form of dysphoria. I don't find having breasts nor a vagina very appealing. I'd much rather have a flat chest. I think I'd honestly prefer having a penis over my current parts, but that's not very possible for me. I love being considered very androgynous... It feels good. But I don't know if I have dysphoria due to being taken advantage of when I was just hitting puberty (this was done by two AFAB folks so I'm not sure if that's why I find vaginas repulsive or not). Maybe? I don't know guys. 

I'm afraid. I can't stop thinking about this. I feel almost like I'm suicidal. I don't want my family to hate me. And if I do feel this way, how do I find a relationship? I feel stupid. I wish I was just myself and it didn't matter... I don't know I'm just blabbering here I guess. Being non-binary is fine...I just don't know how to feel...

then arises the next problem: i've been identifying as a lesbian for the past 5 years. i know for certain im attracted to women, but nowadays i feel guilty and wrong for identifying as a wlw despite being so uncomfortable with anything feminine being attached to me. i suppose i should also add that i don't think of myself as male, at least not 100% percent.

*Processing img 6h3i47c1irr31...*

&amp;#x200B;

sick of social habits so many people share that truly hurt some of our sweetest kids to the point where they decide it is just not worth it to go on

&amp;#x200B;

In French language which is my native one we are providing a specific gender to every object in the room and every animal and every plant

&amp;#x200B;

yes

&amp;#x200B;

a giraf's pronouns whether male or female are she/her

&amp;#x200B;

but a baboon's pronouns whether male or female are he/him

&amp;#x200B;

the sun is masculine

&amp;#x200B;

but the moon and the stars are feminine

&amp;#x200B;

how crazy is this

&amp;#x200B;

where does it come from

&amp;#x200B;

it could be considered funny until the moment you know that almost one gender non conforming/transgender people out of two under the age of 25 has attempted suicide at least once

&amp;#x200B;

 then this urge to gender anyone at any time and in some languages to gender any single thing is not funny at all 

&amp;#x200B;

and it is not supposed to be considered as legitimate just because 'we have done it since the dawn of time'

&amp;#x200B;

WE DO NOT HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING A STEP BACK FROM WHAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 

&amp;#x200B;

why do people need to specify the assumed gender of a person EVERY SINGLE TIME they are talking about them

&amp;#x200B;

how is it of any use in a family situation? in a business situation? in an education situation? how is it of any use at all?

&amp;#x200B;

do we specify the color of the eyes of a person any time we are talking about them ? their height? their weight? the type of their morphology?

&amp;#x200B;

so why specify gender, and especially when most people understand gender as the assumption of the type of genitals people hide in their pants? how healthy is that?

&amp;#x200B;

as many others here I guess

&amp;#x200B;

I know the answers to these last two questions

&amp;#x200B;

it is not a healthy habit since some people suffer from it and others are taking advantage of this habit to bully and hate on people who don't fit in and.or question this habit by their very existence

&amp;#x200B;

and there is not a legitimate reason for people to continue to do so once they know it is able to hurt people and especially their own kids

&amp;#x200B;

as transgender people we are the living proof it is not correct to assign a gender to someone at birth according to the type of their genitals

&amp;#x200B;

as nonbinary people we are the living proof it is not correct to assign a specific gender to someone at birth

&amp;#x200B;

we are the living proof it is not correct to assume someone's gender at all and we do not have to apologize for pointing at this nonsense

&amp;#x200B;

since the moment people -mostly kids- get hurt in the process

&amp;#x200B;

it is our responsability

&amp;#x200B;

\*

&amp;#x200B;

hi

I'm j

my pronouns are they.them

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

my ultimate goal is to end gender assignment at birth and give back to any kid on this planet the human right to build their own identity according to how they feel instead of what is expected from them

&amp;#x200B;

there is obviously a tremendous way to go so I have been plotting for a while and came up with ideas

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to discuss these ideas with those of you who can relate to my journey in the next few weeks and see how it goesüôè

&amp;#x200B;

\*

&amp;#x200B;

for now I'll just let you know about an open letter I published on change. org discussing the matter above

&amp;#x200B;

it will do as a petition to gather people who also believe in the benefits that would result from the end of gender assignement for kids (and in everyday life)

&amp;#x200B;

I am only 2 signatures from my first goals which is to gather 20 people around that message

&amp;#x200B;

from there I aim to reach 100 signatures and beyond

&amp;#x200B;

if you have ever wished you wouldn't have been assigned a gender at birth or your gender being assumed by the entire society consider gather with like minded people and help me spread OUR word &gt;&gt;&gt; [http://chng.it/pmyfDrSW](http://chng.it/pmyfDrSW)

604,2019-10-11 04:44:03,dga3sw,6,19,"So here's my background for those of you that don't know. I'm 29 years old I'm a software engineer run my own business as well happy married for two years. I've been with my wife for a total of 5 years and a few months. I was very open with her the first week we started dating about my gender identity issues that I suffered against when I was younger and I still was dealing with them at that time.

She immediately supported me and everything and when we bought a house together she allowed me to dress anyway I felt even though I probably didn't look good because I was basically a guy in a dress. This year I've dabbled in actually going out dressed completely it's female including wig and makeup.

During a few of these occasions she did accompany me and she did support me what is a little bit tough on her because she had to be the strong one in these situations but it's completely understandable. 

After about a half a dozen times I took a look at what I really wanted to do going forward. Since I started to go out dressed I always told people I identify as nonbinary. because truthfully I was perfectly happy as a guy I just like to be feminine and present feminine at times.

fast forward to a few weeks ago I took the plunge and purged almost 75% of every article of clothing that I had. We donate it to the VA cuz my wife is for military I decide to build a single wardrobe with a combination of clothes that I felt pretty in but I could wear everyday.  I found a wardrobe that suits my body type but I'm very comfortable in and I can go out and get compliments from people about my outfit which makes me feel pretty.

that was only a few weeks ago and the amount of I don't care has grown to such a high level. I'm wearing jeggings leggings skinny jeans wedges women's boots and most of the shoes I wear have some sort of heel on them. I'm not walking out in pumps because frankly to me that just doesn't look right with the outfits that I have.

I always felt safe going out with my wife like this but the last couple weeks I've been venturing out myself and not even paying attention anybody. Truth be told very few people look or care, and those people that do are women and they're giving me a compliment which I absolutely enjoy. 

like the other day I was sitting at a bar having a margarita at a Mexican place in a girl will be younger me came over and asked me where I got my shoes from she loves them I told her Torrid.

The only two areas I still need ever, as my family cuz unfortunately that's going to be an uphill battle. And the other battle is my wife's extended family, immediate family has been supportive since day one. If it wasn't for my family I probably what completely percent of 100% in the way that I feel most comfortable all the time. Don't get me wrong I do wear straight leg women's jeans around my family but they're really hard to distinguish between men's because they're not super skinny like my other jeans. but I do work tennis shoes around them and not boots wedges or high heel boots.

The title pretty much says it all. I‚Äôve been presenting as nonbinary online since the age of 17 and have exclusively used they/them pronouns online. 

I would honestly come out IRL, but I live in a french aera, and in languages in the same vein as french, there is no neutral pronouns, as male pronouns are defined as the neutrality by language standards. Rare attempts have been made to create a neutral pronoun set in french, but the one i‚Äôve seen was a mashup of ‚Äúil‚Äù (he) and ‚Äúelle‚Äù (she), to form ‚Äúiel‚Äù which really doesn‚Äôt fit me.

But I guess I‚Äôve sort of adapted to being referred as my birth pronouns IRL? I wish people would see me as neutral irl (working towards that goal gradually), but i‚Äôve sort of resigned to being called by my birth pronouns.

I just have been really questioning my gender identity lately, and I feel like I'm very unhappy identifying as a man.  But at the same time, I don't completely feel like a woman.  Generally, I've just been hating prevalent toxic masculinity that my friends exhibit, and even question my role as a 'man.'  Even with the realization that men are separable from those problematic traits, that still just isn't enough for me.

I don't really want to push any gender stereotypes, so I'll just state some physical and social discomfort I feel.  I *really* hate how deep my voice is, and it makes me anxious and self-loathing to hear it.  It's even deeper than it sounds to me, which is so much worse.  I don't know how to sound less brood-sounding in tone though, so I'm just really physically unhappy with that.  Also, this girl at my work calls me 'sir' all the time and I HATE IT.

And quite honestly, I don't hate my penis.  I am very satisfied with having it.  But it's everything else that I despise about my current false identity, really.

Am I experiencing dysphoria?  I don't know, but one thing for sure is that I no longer want people to see me as male, I hate it.

I'm nonbinary - specifically agender ... which I think of as a subset of nb ... but also I'm 32 and grew up without these ideas available to me so all this has been post turning 30, finishing grad school, and moving to a really big city developments.

Anyway ... does anyone have experience using pronouns other than they/them? I'm AFAB and I don't really MIND she/her or he/him or they/them, but I encountered Spivak (ey/em) and my heart just went YES. I basically don't tell people this because even the people I'm out to, ey/em feels like a big ask and I don't want to be... I guess too precious? Which is kind of an awful thing to worry about?

So I'm curious if anyone else has used less common nonbinary pronouns and how that's gone in terms of people's willingness to get with the program and not be jerks. Again, I don't mind other pronouns - they don't sandpaper my nerves like being called a girl or woman or lady or ma'am does - but I only really LIKE ey/em.

So I live out in a very conservative rural area.

701,2019-10-12 19:18:52,dgzk9s,1,0,"So I met my wife 5 years and 4 months ago we married just over two years ago. I came clean very early on (2-3 weeks in) about gender issues because I had multiple breakups due to that. She's always been really supportive but something's did take a little bit of time and that's what I want to talk about today.

When you don't live in lgbtq+ community, it can take time for people to adjust to requests and while lot of people want everything now you have to realize it might be easy on you but it's harder on other people. My wife let me dress however wanted a home I didn't really ask for different pronouns but she refer to me is my female name every now and then often times in third person as well. This should be usually in a casual sentence and never very serious.

But at the same time I often see somebody, out as transgender non-binary genderqueer excetera and they immediately demand the use of different names and pronouns. Why I think that people should work and understand the feelings of that person the person who's asking for it needs to understand it takes people time to mentally adjust and honestly just to remember sometimes my memory is very bad especially with names. 

It's also difficult for example if your 12 year old son comes out as transgender and wants to be called by the female version of his name but doesn't percentage female at all. That in itself I think is more difficult than if your kid is already wearing dresses and wants to be called by a different name. 

I've seen many examples especially on the MTF subreddit where somebody won't even begin presenting as the gender they prefer despite being on hormones for a year plus but then get upset because their family sometimes struggles or forgets to use the right name or pronouns. Like sometimes you got to help people out if you're upset you're being misgendered and you're wearing the close of the gender you were born but not the gender you identify with can you really blame society for that?

I've gone out complete dressed as a woman many times and maybe it's just I live in a Kinder area I've never gotten this gender despite mean not really passing out well. Be honest I rarely get double looks and when I do it's because I'm holding my wife's hand and people think we're lesbians. 

Anyway back to my wife...

She didn't really feel comfortable with me going out either dressed as a female or as I do now which is incorporate a bunch of different styles in my everyday wardrobe. But we agreed that I would go out to a drag show at an lgbt-friendly event with a friend of mine as a woman for the first time. 

When she saw me she realized that I do okay and we've gone out once or twice me completely dressed female with a wig and makeup. The first time is a little bit tough on her because she had to be the really strong one and normally I'm The Rock in the relationship.

For a long time I believed I was either genderqueer non-binary because I just enjoyed being feminine at times. So over the past few weeks I decided that I make a completely new wardrobe with a mix of some men's unisex and women's clothes that's going to fit my body type my style and comfortably. I normally have nail polish on my fingers and toes. 

Now we go out all the time I dress however I want she compliments me because she knows I like that and it's quite normal now. we're just a little bit careful because there's a few people in our lives that aren't aware of who I really am and we're not quite the point of letting them know.

She even asked if she could come to the drag show I was attending last night after work. She ended up not coming because the drag show wasn't good because most of the queens were at another big venue that night. So when she got off work we just met for a late dinner because my wife works at 11:30 no stress is my normal self acute unisex sweater Capri jeggings wedges my fingers and toes were done with bright blue with sparkles

So the point of all this is It's Not Easy especially when you have a significant other to deal with these kind of issues. I'm very lucky that my wife is very open-minded nice and kind person. It helps that we build a relationship solely on an emotional connection and not a on a sexual connection.  It can be very difficult for significant others to accept these kind of changes.

But one thing you do have to realize especially if you kept this hidden from the other person your life is they've fallen in love with a certain person in their fearful that person might not be who they really thought they were. You really can't fault the other person if they don't feel comfortable with these situations right away. I would hope that they would try to work it out and work through it and see if the relationship can continue on based off of the adjustments in a relationship.

In closing I would like to request anybody that is dealing with gender identity issues that if you're going to enter into a relationship I don't think it's fair if you don't disclose that you're dealing with these kind of issues. It's better to be friends with that person or not continue to spend a long time with them and then break it off after use invest a lot of time and effort into the relationship. 

It's okay if you don't know where you're heading or what the outcome is going to be when deal with gender identity issues whether you're transgender non-binary non-conforming or any of the other classifications. It took me until about 29 to really understand myself. But since my wife knew upfront about the issues I was dealing with, she helped me to truly understand what I wanted.

732,2019-10-13 07:26:25,dh7fjf,10,6,"I just recently put forward a question in the LGBT area of reddit asking what my gender was, and a little response I got pointed me to Non Binary, so I kind of wondered if I might get more clarification here, because I feel like I still don't have an answer.

I probably don't know all the terminology, but I will explain myself as assigned male at birth, and for the most part I am still pretty comfortable being a guy, I don't really feel any dysphoria in being a guy, like having a beard. But I have otherwise never been super masculine, like along with my long nails as a kid, I got a share of bullying put on me in being called 'gay'. Having thinking for a year or so, I have recognised certain things do make me feel kind of sick that wonder if it was people call such, and it is along the lines of hearing things like young boys told they have to be a real man and not cry, and be tough. I know that just sounds like fighting against toxic masculinity, and maybe it is, but there has felt like distanced element when I hear a ""boys will be boys"" thing, just felt wrong if applied to me. I don't know, maybe none of that means anything.

I know this will sound dumb, but I had what I might call an awakening a few years ago, with video games.  When I make a character, mostly called Dusky, it felt like a part of me represented in the game, and playing Dark Souls I was finding that I was not having a very easy time as a magic character, and doing research it looked like I should try a warrior character. But when I tried to create an as usual male character, something about it felt really wrong, like something about the idea of making me (Dusky) a masculine warrior was inauthentic, and not me. But suddenly I had the idea of what if I made the character female, played with the name a bit to be 'Duskei', and then have her be a tough warrior, and the feeling kind of totally disappeared, actually kind of feeling more right than I expected.

Most people have no deep reason for how they play a game, but the female Duskei persona kind of felt like an equal part to my male Dusky, and I found myself really comfortable with playing female characters. But it was not like something I made up, but kind of like something I had ignored and finally gave a name to. It has been since then that I have thought of the times in the years where I could wish that I could just turn into something like an alternate reality female version of myself, which I just thought that everyone might have those thoughts at times. Where as I had also felt a connection to feminism I was curious with things like anime where the line of gender could be crossed. And the closest I have come to putting into words what I feel like the movie Inside Out, where people are made up of a lot of different person like parts, I feel some are males, but others are female. Kind of like the main character of that movie has.

It isn't like I don't feel like I am male, but I realized that I might have been supressing parts of me that feel like female. I don't know if that is normal for cis, there is that concept like having your inner woman or something. I remember feeling really happy when I was just a kid when I learned that the particular spelling of my name could be both a male name and a female name, at least according to a website, and I am thinking if that should have been a sign or something. Like I really have not been a fan of my name spelt the common way or shortened in a way that is more masculine. I don't want to stand out, which I feel like would happen if I dressed ambiguously, my social anxiety probably would not take it, and I don't know what I want from having been looking into all of this.

Before I started looking into things like trans people, I am pretty sure that I thought that non binary people were trying to have things too convenient to them, in a way of looking special, like everyone would wish just switch gender. Something like Non Binary is too convenient of a title, especially if someone does not feel like a totally in the middle, because what I feel like is too ambiguous, and still kind of like a man to say I feel like the examples I saw.

Did use the search function, realized what I wanted to do was make a longass rant instead of asking anything productive so here goes nothing.

I was a textbook tomboy as a kid, and my parents were very liberal about it. Never wore skirts or dresses and played with a bunch of traditionally 'boy things', life was great. Then at the age of 12 I discovered anime. And the goodness of cosplay. My first cosplay was a male character, and my parents agreed 11/10 to it. You know, parent logic automatically assumes that cosplaying as a female character means having your butt hanging out in front of cameras and that's therefore a no-no. 

My second cosplay was also a dude, as with more than half of my cosplays to date. I love it. I always reasoned with myself that cishet girls like guys so cosplaying as guys you love is perfectly normal but apparently? That's not how other people think? 

Anyway. A few cosplays, binders and wigs later I figured that cosplaying has always been a way to satisfy both my escapist tendencies and love of aesthetics. We roleplayed as toddlers, I continued throughout middle school in the form of forums and straight out went to cosplay by the time I graduated because real life was nowhere near as fun. At the end of the day I guess I just liked being someone else for a while.

Highschool was also around the time I got into fashion in general. So yes, for the first time in her life, ya girl donned a frilly pink lolita dress and took a few selfies. By the end of the year I had a comprehensive wardrobe of cutesy outfits and an equal share of punk jackets complete with chains and studded collars. I grew to consider fashion as an extension of my cosplay habit. It was like cosplay, except the character was myself. Some days I would don a boyish look and other days a girlish one but the one constant was that even in a cute blouse and a pleated skirt I would flatten my chest because I was literally repulsed at myself. Never had an aching desire for a dick either but honestly, if I woke up as a dude I'd continue living my life as usual and the world would keep spinning. But even now since I moved from my Asian home where skin=sin to the center of Western clubbing culture, I still can't bring myself to wear anything that indicates a cleavage, or anything that is tight around the waist so as to show curves...

The clinic told me that I could contact them to get started and schedule a consultation appointment and everything when I'm 10 lbs away from the BMI limit, which for my height is 225. Only 13.6 lbs to go!!

I don't know if this is real or if I'm just making things up in my head. I had never questioned my gender before, I always felt okay identifying as a girl and when I was a kid I was almost stereotypically feminine: I loved dresses, the color pink, everything related to princesses, etc. And a lot of my self esteem is linked to performing femininity, even though I think butch women and androgynous people are super beautiful, I can feel like I'm looking good when I'm in non-feminine clothes. At the same time, I don't feel like being identified as a girl is very important to me? Like, if someone misgendered me I don't feel like it would bother me .  
I started questioning my gender specially when two people in my class came out as nb. The thing is, I'm super bisexual, but I didn't even think about my sexuality and went with the ""I'm straight"" default until a bi person came into my life. So I wonder if this could be something like that, I just never though much about things like gender and sexuality.  
Anyway, I've been thinking about how I'd feel if people called me pronouns other than ""she/her"" and sometimes I feel like it suits me, but I'm afraid this might be just a phase, or that I'm just influenced because I really enjoy reading about gender and queer theory.

777,2019-10-14 01:15:54,dhjhj0,13,2,"Hi folks,

I'm in an utterly confusing place in life right now. This spring I had a very rapid awakening to my hitherto completely dormant identity as non binary (looking back thre were signs for a long time) and with that a creeping discomfort with my agab (female). This of course is highly confusing, especially as I'm 33 years old and thought stuff like this didn't hit later in life. Anyway.

While in the midst of this, and keeping it to myself apart from chatting online, I met a girl while away at work and fell hard for her. She is trans herself and I told her all of this and she has been nothing but amazingly supportive. The place where we both work is a pretty special environment and people live super close together, and your world grows very small. We dated for about three weeks before I left (we work 2 months on, 2 months off) and I went directly to go spend some time in the US with friends I hadn't seen in two years. As soon as we were apart I felt like some of that sense of comnection to her dissapated, but I attributed it to the change of environment and being absorbed in being back in a place I had missed a lot. She, however, had gotten exceedingly into me, and over all I dove into dating her head first without eally thinking and things got very serious very, very fast. She is also 11 years my junior, and this is her first real relationship.

While in the US, though, I met my ex whom I also hadn't seen for two years, when he broke up with me. We had dated for a year and I was super into him, and was devastated when he decided to leave. Things were friendly between us for the last year or so and we met mostly to talk things through. However, he ended up telling me how he has spent the past two years regretting breaking up with me and trying to get over me with no success. I, too, have spent the past two years being heartbroken and missing him like crazy. I told the girl what was going on because I didn't want to lie to her. The guy seems to be very sincere in his wishes, and he is a great guy, and broke up with me due to his demanding work which forced him to be away a lot and insecurity about marrying me (which we'd have to do for visas etc). He says he has grown tired of that work and wants a stability he didn't want back then. He wants to date (and marry) me and create a life with me. This is all I ever wanted and wished for, and had he just thought of this a month ago all would be amazing, but now I have this girl who is head over heels with me and I have no idea what to do with that. Meanwhile I'm spending time with this guy for the remaining week I'm here because I want to know what being with him again is like so taht I can make an informed decision. This makes me feel deceitful, but I honestly don't know what else to do, or how to handle this.

Sorry for that unloading which had little to do with the real question, but thanks for letting me vent: Do I tell this guy, my ex, about this whole gender crisis? I cut my long hair off to a boyish haircut which he has said several times that he likes. He is super accepting of trans folks and whatever people in general, sometimes I feel like he hs magically been excempt from all the bullshit conditioning society feeds us, homophobia, sexism, racism, toxic masculinity etc. But there is a difference in being accepting and 100% cool with all of this, and having someone you're seriously dating no longer being a cis woman, which they used to be. I'm still very closeted with a few exceptions and also honestly don't know if I have the energy to every come out to the greater masses and my dysphoria is very mild, mostly just annoying and uncomfortable, and I don't know if I'll ever actually go through with the changes I want to make (low dose T as I really want a small beard and a small dick) as that would mean I would have to deal with coming out, which frankly is an equally terrifying and exhausting thought.

779,2019-10-14 01:48:42,dhjuvm,3,6,"Hi guys, so I'm afab but for the past few months I've been identifying as nonbinary (most likely gender fluid, but I'm not absolutely certain yet). I don't really experience gender dysphoria when I present female, but when I do bind and tie my hair back (I‚Äôm not ready to cut it yet) I definitely feel sooo much more comfortable with myself, like I just gained something I never knew I was missing. Also, being misgendered isn't terrible, but there are some days when I really wish people would use they/them pronouns.

Anyways, I want to come out but I'm really scared. I know my friends will support me, but I've known most of them for my entire life and I just feel uncomfortable asking them to think of me with a new name and they/them pronouns. I'm out to one friend who's also nonbinary, but they live in a different state so they can't really help me come out to everyone over here.

It definitely wasn't this hard when I came out as bi.

I'm pretty sure everyone (parents not included) would be supportive, but I'm still super scared.

So I'm afab and came out as a binary trans guy a couple of years ago, all fine and dandy. For a lot of reasons I ignored some of the more non-binary aspects of my identity. 
I've been on T for about two years now and am happy with pretty much all of the changes, except for one. I never exactly liked body and facial hair but kind of took it as part of the package. Recently though my current partner (24, mtf) has encouraged me to remove body and facial hair because she knows how much I don't like it. I now like not having body and facial hair to the point I start to feel dysphoric if I'm not able to shave every couple of days. 
I now kind of want electrolysis, or some more permanent method of hair removal. I know of a local trans person who provides an electrolysis service on a sliding pay scale explicitly for trans people so this is a less expensive option for me than it might sound, but I'm really struggling with feeling silly for choosing to go on testosterone and then wanting to remove one of the effects of it. 
Does anyone else have any experience of a situation like this? Am I being irrational? I've also thought about trying to arrange a mixed dose of estrogen/testosterone as opposed to straight T, but that would come with other side effects and argh.

I'm a nonbinary, gender fluid AMAB person. I prefer to dress androgynously, not overtly male or female. I'd like to wear a couple of subtle lingerie pieces in public while I'm out socialising and I have a couple of questions that I'm hoping to draw on this sub's experience for answers.

1. I want to wear a black corset under a shirt. When you google 'male corsets' you always seem to get either weightlifting aids or steam punk pieces. I'm looking for a black corset, possibly with suspenders, that finishes higher than a waspie. I'd like to avoid corsets with cups that boost cleavage - just a straight hem that finishes around the nipples. Any recommendations? Any good brands to check out? 

2. If I start feeling overtly male while I'm wearing lingerie, it can have an unwanted effect! If I wear them while I feel more androgynous/female, it's just underwear. I don't have any control over this so I need something that I can wear with hosiery (preferably something pouch, thong or g-string based) that keeps erections under control.

As a kid I was what you'd call a tomboy, preferred running around and playing football with the boys, constantly wore trousers and liked climbing trees and generally hated anything pink/girly. 

As I got older that changed a bit but that could just have been due to the pressures of society. 

At the moment I've grown to quite like makeup and some aspects of feminine clothes but I still hate pink and a recurring thought I've had since I was little has always been that I'd like to experience being male, even if it was just for an hour. 

The biggest concern I have though is how people in my everyday life will react if I am indeed non binary. 

The one person I know who will be the most accepting is my boyfriend of 3 and a half years. He was very supportive when I was figuring out what sexuality I identify as and has been learning more about the LGBTQ community since we started dating. 

The thing is I'm still not 100% sure if he would be OK with me being non binary considering he is a very straight guy. That could just be me overthinking but I can't help it. 

Then there's my family who I have no idea how they'd react. My brother is the most likely to be accepting but my parents are very 50/50. 

There's also my best friend of nearly 14 years who is part of the LGBTQ herself but is slightly acephobic and idk what her thoughts on me being non binary would be.

Hello all, I‚Äôm still getting the hang of using reddit and posting so please bare with me :)

Anyways lately I‚Äôve been wondering if I might want to transition. To give you a little background I‚Äôm 20 yrs old and AFAB and currently use she/her pronouns. I have been identifying as a cis gay(identifying as lesbian makes me super uncomfortable)person who had been dressing masculine since about 14yrs old. I‚Äôve also been getting my haircut in a masculine way since then as well. But I‚Äôve been questioning my gender identity for a couple years now. But I think inside I do want to start HRT and eventually get top surgery. I have a lot of bottom dysphoria and a little too dysphoria(I have a very small chest so it‚Äôs easy for me to just throw a sports bra on and a baggier shirt and push the idea out that I even have breasts). 

All that being said I‚Äôm scared that I might change my mind. Some days I feel like I could go on living my life as a female and be okay and some days I don‚Äôt even wanna get out of bed because of how dysphoric I‚Äôm feeling and how badly I just want to be seen as more masculine. 
I‚Äôm also very nervous of what my family will think, especially my grandparents and non immediate family. When I came out as gay my dad and step mom(who are super religious) would constantly take me to church have someone pray over me to basically pray the gay away. My non immediate family isn‚Äôt super religious but still I don‚Äôt know how informed they are. My partner(21yr old cis female) is very supportive in whatever I decide to do so I know I‚Äôll still have someone but I don‚Äôt want to lose my family.

I am AMAB, and I am kind of leaning towards maybe having multiple genders inside of me, and for most of my life I have been supressing my female gender(s?), which occasionally leaked through.

I otherwise have mostly been attracted to women, women in general okay, but really boyish looking women especially got my attention, like I mostly did not understand why other guys were more into the larger breasts, but when they were small to even flat, with a boyish haircut, I could feel stronger. I would also say I maybe felt the occasional urge towards men, which kind of had me wonder if I was gay, maybe even bisexual, but when I evaluate that I can't say I feel anything in particular to the male form. I did not feel gay or bisexual.

I think that I was coming more to recognize parts of my other genders, I think that I felt one part a draw for lesbian narratives. I understand lesbian/yuri is something totally enjoyed by cis men, but I think it was a feeling of being one of them. The other part, more recently, I think I have started to feel the attraction towards more masculine elements as I am becoming more accepting of my female side, like I think maybe proportionally.

I‚Äôm AFAB, my fuller gender identity is current agender woman, and I‚Äôd describe my presentation as mixing femme and androgynous. At work I use ‚Äúshe/her‚Äù pronouns, and I have no specific intent to change that any time soon. In my personal life I‚Äôve been thinking about what pronouns I want, and I feel like it gives me a lot of anxiety to pick either ‚Äúshe/her‚Äù, or ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù, or even neopronouns. The only option that does not cause me anxiety is that I definitely do not want ‚Äúhe/him‚Äù, and that‚Äôs certain. But expressing any preference for any other pronouns does not feel right.

All I got was love, messages of love , people coming out of the woodwork that I hadn't seen or heard from in years just sending me support.

889,2019-10-16 00:11:36,dih0kv,6,4,"Hey friends

I was wondering if anyone here had any advice

Over the past few months I've tried to start binding, with very little success, but nothing was as bad as my experience today.

For context, my chest is VERY large, especially in relation to the rest of my body. My bra size is 32G, with my chest 13 inches larger in circumference than my waist. Having a chest this large has ALWAYS been a huge cause of anxiety throughout my life, and as I've been trying really hard to present androgynous lately, it's been super difficult to get rid of it.

I have tried binders from gc2b and underworks. The gc2b binder barely compresses my chest at all. It's mildly uncomfortable, and I still look like I have giant boobs.

I recently ordered a compression tank top and sports bra from underworks. The tank top isn't uncomfortable at all, but again, it doesn't flatten me that much. The sports bra on the other hand completely flattens my chest; however, it's one of the most painful experiences I've had.

I put it on today. It's so tight that in order to get it over my chest, I had to step into it, stretch it to its limit all the way over my hips (which was NOT easy) and then finally get it on my  shoulders.

Once I had it on, I could barely breathe. (I have scoliosis so lung compression is always a worry of mine.) My spouse could hear my breathing from the other room. After about 5 minutes, I started to get lightheaded and dizzy, so I got it off as fast as I could (which wasn't fast, since again i had to take it back to down my huge hips... I really hate having this hyper-feminine body...)

For the rest of the evening, I've been feeling nauseous and lightheaded, even though it's been off for the past hour.

So, right now I'm feeling a mix of awful feelings - physically, short of breath and nauseous, and emotionally, so discouraged that I'm just stuck having a body like this that I can't do anything to hide.

It usually starts with feeling euphoric about the possibility of becoming a woman followed by panic about all the transphobia I'd have to deal with.  I also usually start thinking I'm not trans and that these thoughts are the result of some kind of pathetic incelish neurosis.  I worry that I just want to be trans so I can get off the hook for my male privilege or that I'm just trying justify being a weak passive guy with no self confidence.  I also worry that I just admire the queer community and want to be part of it for community and solidarity that is one of the few benefits of being part of a marginalized group or that I have a need to justify my self pity and persecution complex.

I'm autistic though I'm lucky enough to be able mostly pass as neurotypical.  All the same I've never had a romantic relationship and it's really difficult for me to hold jobs and get through school.  I've had three one night stands that simultaneously made me feel like i had sexually assaulted myself and terrified that I had inadvertently crossed consensual lines due to an inability to read social cues, toxic masculinity making it feel like losing my virginity was a matter of life or death, and an ignorance of affirmative consent at the time.  Almost everyone I talked to including some of the women I had sex with told me that it was clearly just bad sex but I can't shake the guilt.  When I remember those experience's it still feels almost physically painful sometimes.  I've semi-intentionally avoided sex since then.  I guess I worry that I'm sub-consciously convincing myself that I'm trans to explain everything that's wrong with my life.  

I definitely don't like being a dude.  I hate the fact that women are wary of men by default and that they will never fully trust me.  I like being friends with women more than men but the fact that I'm attracted to some of to them might be perceived as creepy or threatening makes it really hard to talk to them.

I really want to be friends with women in the way they are friends with each other.  I've also heard things about how estrogen changes your sexuality that appeal to me.

I'd like longer hair and wearing women's clothes and makeup are something i'd like to try.  I mostly just want to be socially perceived as a woman.  This would be difficult because if i were hypothetically born with a female body I'd probably be pretty masculine and I worry that being a butch lesbian with a male body would just make me a man as far as most people are concerned.  I also don't really have any stereotypically feminine interests.  I listen to  a lot of loud aggressive music and I kind of have edgy teenage boy sensibilities.

893,2019-10-16 02:10:51,diihli,3,5,"Theres plenty of people that have said this better than me but here my attempt at a watered down version of this idea. That androgyny is highly male coated and is hard for afab folks to achieve with the anatomy we are given. It feels that no matter how androgynous or masculine my appearance is, unless my chest isnt visible I will be read as feminine. This irritates the fuck out if me. After playing with wearing a binder and how it feels for my chest to be gone, it hard to have my chest showing. I dont have any issues with my chest and actually want to keep it. My problem has always been how I am perceived solely because I happen to have them. Its wild to me how inescapable womanhood feels unless my anatomy configuration is completly skewed. Even if I packed with my chest I feel I would still he read mostly female with my other characteristics. I feel invalifldated, that my gender identity as being genderqueer will never be taken seriously unless I put high effort into being perceived how I identify.

I experience pretty severe cramping with the first day or two of my period, which leads to feeling nauseous &amp; leaving work, never mind feeling betrayed by my body. After months of having to take at least a day off of work (including today, in my busy season) and dealing with off-cycle bleeding, I finally made a doctor's appointment to address things. After the exam, she asked about how I felt about hormonal birth control, which I am not very comfortable with. I expressed my concerns of how hormonal treatment might impact my gender identity and she didn't flinch for a second. She asked my pronouns and made sure that she input them into the system herself. It was reassuring, especially as I had never met with her before and I'm only very subtly out to a handful of people. We discussed options, ordered additional tests, and made a follow-up appointment for a non-estrogen birth control to hopefully ease cramping and potentially eliminate my period all together. Even the idea of being period-free is gender-euphoric for me!

Today I was feeling the syndrome. My gender felt more aligned with my biological sex and it made me question myself. Am I making this up? Am I trying to be unique? Am I a ""transtrender""? 

And my answer to myself was no. I've felt this way all my life. It's okay to feel fluid. It's okay and normal to have a less dysphoric day. Buttttt...I still felt like I was questioning myself. So I brought it up to my therapist. (My therapist is enby genderfluid and queer THANK THE GAY GODS!)

And they said effectively this: feeling imposter syndrome is normal and actually shows that I'm *empowering* myself to explore my gender and I'm learning and growing. I'm being open and listening to myself. I'm allowing myself to finally go on this journey to understanding my gender. 

Also that cis gendered people aren't going to and don't want to physically change their bodies I.e. through surgery or hormones. I kinda chuckled and thought...huh yeah you're right. Cis women generally don't fantasize about chopping their breasts off, do they? Haha.

I'm a 22yo student with autism and anxiety problems. I do not feel like any gender at all, I don't even know what does it mean to feel gender. I feel like I'm just human. I've been this way as long as I can  remember. I have a unisex name and our language doesn't have gendered pronouns so I don't have any problems on these things. I have a couple of problems and questions I'd like to talk about with you. 


First of all I have a woman's body, but I'm taller than average women in my country and I don't have much feminine facial features. No matter what I look like people always stare, question my gender etc. First moments of me questioning my gender I was trying to present feminine to avoid confusion and unwanted attention (y'know anxiety and stuff) but people confused me for men dressed as women to do sex work. (They don't do it because they are not cis but only for sex work and they are not respected [I don't mind what people do with their lives as long as they are not hurting anybody]) and getting laughs on the street is hurtful. Nonbinary is not a known concept here so I will struggle no matter what I do but I still feel incredibly uncomfortable and anxious when people stare too much to gender me somehow. Also people always assume if you dont look female you must be someone who wants to be a man or extremely masculine etc.  Anything gender specific makes me very uncomfortable. How can I get over this anxiety and not care about what people do and say? 


I'm very very uncomfortable with my body's feminine features, I have small boobs but I still feel uncomfortable I've never tried binding does that help? Is there anybody here who got top surgery and how are you feeling about it? I also don't want to get periods and I don't wanna be fertile, they also feel gender related to me and makes me uncomfortable. Is there a way for me to get rid of these? Does medicine support something like this? Or would they just go; oh you have autism and we won't take you seriously? 


I always wonder what taking testosterone helps you achieve as an afab Nonbinary? 



What kind of media can I surround myself with to get rid of the idea of gender specific beauty concept? I mean, I still feel bad about my looks for not having a feminine beauty. This needs to change for me. 




I identity as bisexual, I used to identity as pansexual because I thought bisexuality didnt include other genders besides male and female but I'm surrounded by total idiots who think pansexuality involves animals. So I'm nb and my sexual attraction is not defined by the other party's gender. Does it still make sense for me to identity as bisexual? Also if I were to date a straight cis man would that man be not actually straight for being attracted to me? I really don't know how does these things work.

Always hated my period. Painful, messy, embarrassing, uncomfortable. Have known since I learned how babies are born that I didn't want to give birth (literally have had night terrors about pregnancy). Of course, being a young, healthy AFAB, all of my past OB/GYNs have refused to even consider any form of sterilization surgery for me because ""You'll change your mind"". The most *infuriating* thing that *everyone* says to me simply because I was born with a working uterus.

Cut to yesterday, day 1 of shark week. I'm hobbling around at work, instant heating pads clutched to my lower back and beneath my belly, whimpering in pain every time I had to move from sitting to standing or vice-versa. I jokingly mentioned to the OB/GYN office that shares a space with my internal med office that their doc should just pull me into a procedure room real quick and just yank my uterus out through my vagina.

""Well, you wouldn't have to have a complete hysterectomy to stop having periods, you know,"" the nurse said casually. She took a bite of her sandwich before continuing.""Could just do an ablation and tubal. Doctor $name does those pretty frequently.""

""... Sorry, what?""

Apparently there's a very brief, minimally invasive pair of outpatient procedures that they are happy to do for me. Tubal litigation, the one most are familiar with, would be getting my fallopian tubes cut (they can also be tied, stapled, or burned) and my ovaries removed. Endometrial ablasion is even cooler (well, technically hotter) -- they would go in and basically turn my uterine lining into one gigantic burn scar. My reply to her was ""that sounds metal as fuck, let's do it!""

As I walked away from the conversation with a bounce in my step and a plan in my mind, I realized there were three things that felt gender affirming about the procedure: sterilization, loss of menstruation, and the fact that I would spend the rest of my life with *sick af burn scars all up inside me*.

1126,2019-10-20 16:27:44,dklvn9,4,18,"Hello lovely folks! It‚Äôs been three weeks since I came out as agender and it‚Äôs gone really smoothly. The only friction I‚Äôve encountered is with cis male FWB‚Äôs (I‚Äôm AFAB) but even that was less than anticipated and quickly resolved. I‚Äôm not coming out to my family because we are all but estranged - I‚Äôm 32 and live in another continent from them.

So the final hurdle of telling people I care about is in my professional environment. I am a PhD candidate in medieval history at a prestigious university in a European capitol. Academics in the humanities tend to be fairly liberal but there‚Äôs a socially conservative streak here and my supervisor, who is absolutely critical for my current and future success, is an old white dude. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to introduce him to a same-sex partner, for instance, but I‚Äôm really nervous that he‚Äôs going to roll his eyes at my asking him to use my pronouns. And if he starts taking me less seriously then my career could absolutely sink without his advocating for me, even just by not doing as much rather than actively sabotaging it. 

I ended up wearing my new They/Them t-shirt to a post-department-event pub night last week. A new professor I really like and who does gender studies commented on it positively and we spoke about it for a bit. I was genuinely surprised to find that I‚Äôm the first agender/nonbinary person that she‚Äôs ever met not online. That was a great start, but she‚Äôs new and has a position that my supervisor wanted so I‚Äôm not going to gauge their current relationship or ask her to put herself against him any further. 

I‚Äôve decided to get in touch with a third professor, who‚Äôs been here for a while and has a good relationship with my supervisor. This professor has served as my internal reviewer for the candidacy reviews and always had great things to say about my work, and has also served as my module coordinator for the class I tutor. Unfortunately he specialises in things entirely outside my subfield so there‚Äôs no way he could step in as another supervisor, but I consider him a good resource and mentor. 

I emailed him this morning saying that I was having a personal issue and wondering if he was free to chat this coming week. He responded that he‚Äôs out of the country but can Skype tomorrow afternoon! I accepted and now I‚Äôm kind of plotzing. What do I say? How do I get him to take me seriously without making this out to be A Really Big Deal? Should I ask for advice about framing this for my supervisor specifically?

I‚Äôm not coming out to my family because we are all but estranged - I‚Äôm 32 and live in another continent from them.\n\nSo the final hurdle of telling people I care about is in my professional environment. I am a PhD candidate in medieval history at a prestigious university in a European capitol.

I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to introduce him to a same-sex partner, for instance, but I‚Äôm really nervous that he‚Äôs going to roll his eyes at my asking him to use my pronouns. And if he starts taking me less seriously then my career could absolutely sink without his advocating for me, even just by not doing as much rather than actively sabotaging it. \n\nI ended up wearing my new They/Them t-shirt to a post-department-event pub night last week.

Not sure how many people know about ONTD, but it's a livejournal community about celebrity gossip &amp; current events that is pretty much the only thing still kicking on lj anymore.

Anyway I've been a member there for over a decade now and while it used to be a real nightmare place (wasn't everything on the internet in 2008?) over the last 10, especially 5-ish years people there have gotten a lot better about being socially aware and conscious and open-minded. 

Except when it comes to gender.

Just tonight there was a post about how Always, the menstrual product company, has finally removed the ‚ôÄ symbol from it's packaging. Many trans and NB people complained so they did the right thing and got rid of it. I'm AFAB (NB/agender now, any pronouns) and use Always products and have been, shall we say, less than fond... of that packaging for years. I mostly just rolled my eyes but continued using it because, well, I don't like most of the alternatives. 

Even though I know from experience ONTD isn't good at gender discussions I really thought this time might be an exception and that people would be glad to see a big company finally do something to not be transphobic. 

*Sigh*

All the comments are so fucking ignorant I want to grab these people and shake them.

""That symbol means biologically female so even if someone is non binary or trans if they get a period they're biologically female so they shouldn't be upset.""

""Why is it always things for women getting removed?? Why does no one ever complain about all that stupid stuff being labelled 'For Men'?"" 

""Wait why would transwomen complain about this I thought they didn't have periods"" (yes there were REALLY m u l t i p l e people in there saying this. I can. not.)

And so on and so forth. There was literally ONE other person in the comments who was like ""hey a lot of y'all in here sound pretty transphobic"" but everyone else was just sitting there talking about how removing the venus symbol is actually anti-feminist and ""such a 2019 problem"" and ""don't these people have real problems?"" 

It's just so discouraging that a community that has come so far and (these days) gets so much right is still so utterly and completely backwards on this. I stopped reading and closed the page but the bad mood has already set in and now I just want to scream and cry out of frustration.

Rather than them simply being annoying (as any woman with large boobs can attest), they feel alien to me. 

I‚Äôm on the tomboy/androgynous side, short hair, wear a combination of men‚Äôs/women‚Äôs clothing, don‚Äôt feel womanly, don‚Äôt want to be a mom. Everything about my physique says I‚Äôm equipped for childbearing, but that‚Äôs not something I aspire to. I hate it when people call me ‚Äúmiss‚Äù or ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù or ‚Äúsister‚Äù. But I don‚Äôt know if it would feel right to be called ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù either. It‚Äôs also confusing because I don‚Äôt have any bottom dysphoria.

I‚Äôm intensely jealous of women/NB people with flat chests. Female roommates in the past have admired my boobs and joked that they wish they could trade. I honestly wish I could... It‚Äôs to the point that I got a binder recently, and will start experimenting with that if it‚Äôs not too painful. But I fear it will be because my boobs are pretty firm and will only smash down so much. I‚Äôve thought about getting a breast reduction for years, but it‚Äôs a lot of money, and my job is physically active so I‚Äôd be out of work for weeks if I were to do that. I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd want a drastic reduction or full-on top surgery.

To make things even more confusing, I come from a background of purity culture with a high emphasis on modesty. As it applied to me, modesty mainly meant covering up my cleavage. As a teenager, cleavage was seen as a terrible, scary, slutty thing, and the girls around me were constantly scrutinizing each other, telling each other to pull up their shirts. I was taught that I was responsible for men/boys‚Äô dirty thoughts. I was the guardian of my ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù. I was taught to keep in mind men/boys who are taller than me who could see down my shirt that looked modest at eye level. I could only completely cover my cleavage with t-shirts or turtlenecks. It was clear that my curves were a threat, and my boobs were a liability. Now that I‚Äôve left that church and way of thinking, I wonder what my relationship with my boobs would be like if they weren‚Äôt so stigmatized. Would I still want them gone, or would that dysphoria still be there?

Also, I don‚Äôt know how to express these feelings without trivializing the experiences of trans/NB people who have much more dysphoria than I do. I know that having boobs has led some people to depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide ideation, and that hasn‚Äôt been my experience. It‚Äôs weird having these feelings when I don‚Äôt know if I fit in the NB category either. At this point, I don't even know what I would gain from using a non-binary label. 

It‚Äôs a weird mix of issues and I want to make sure I get a reduction/top surgery for the right reasons.

I'm AMAB, recently coming to terms with being NB for about one and a half year. Before that I identified as gay with a sidenote of female flair moreoften (liking dresses, highheels and so on). Pretty much since the later half of my first (and only) relationship about 11 years ago I knew I was ARO (even when the exact description of being ARO wasn't there for me to grasp until I realized I'm NB and did some research on it) because there weren't any romantic feelings there. Most time when HE (who shall not be named - long story short, he cheated on me in our flat while I slept in the bedroom) said ""I love you"" I told him: ""Same"", ""Dito"" or other words without a romantic feeling behind. So after we ended the relationship and I moved back to my old hometown to get away from all the memories, I never had any relationship. For the last fricking 11 years.... I had ONS sometimes but even that isn't possible any longer. I have a very specific typ of men I like but even if I find someone matching the criteria I can't find the right words or actions to declare my interest. Explaining who I am, a NB, ARO person is always difficult. Most men don't understand that I don't identify with any gender and some are even hostile in their response. The few, who say they ""understand and respect"" are sometimes really creepy in their responses or baiting me with acceptance. 

&amp;#x200B;

And here is my  main problem: since all these negative experiences with dating I often times get panic attacs when meeting a guy, sometimes so bad that I have to cancel the date or in some instances had to ghost (I know it's horrible but I coulnd't stop the panic attack just enough to tell them no) them. Most of the time it's fairly easy to get out of this but sometimes I start thinking things like: they gonna come over and kill you, they try to force you doing things you don't like, they come over, look at you and turn around laughing....

my dad, however, was a different story. he‚Äôs 7 years older than my mom, around the age of 50. i was worried that because of his age he might not be as accepting at first. he knows that i‚Äôm gay, but he‚Äôs pretty uneducated beyond simpler terms like gay, straight, or bi. i thought that my gender identity would be too weird and confusing for him. 

anyways, after coming out to my friends, mom, and sister, i ended up making a public fb post to come out to everyone else. (it felt cowardly, but i was too anxious to do it any other way and i felt it would reach more people.) my dad liked the post, which was a huge relief, but then when i saw him in person he never mentioned it. i was glad that he didn‚Äôt treat me any differently, but i was also disappointed that there wasn‚Äôt any kind of acknowledgement. he still uses my old pronouns, too, so i was starting to wonder if he had actually read the post where i included my preferred pronouns. 

today he was helping me move furniture into my apartment, and i was getting really winded (i‚Äôm super out of shape ok let me live) so he said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being such a girl about it‚Äù

i kind of froze when he said it, and i could see my mom freeze up behind him as well. in the same second, he corrected himself, saying, ‚Äúwait, you‚Äôre not a girl.‚Äù

it was so easy to laugh it off, because of course i had to remind him that regardless of my gender, it was a stupid and sexist thing to say. it felt like a typical conversation between us (he slips up with stuff like that a lot lmao) and idk that part felt so normal that it was really comforting.

1283,2019-10-22 23:32:50,dlqkkm,2,6,"Hey guys, so I‚Äôm trying to decide between two different underworks binder styles and would love to hear some thoughts and personal experiences. This will be my first binder, I ordered the cotton-lined 975 in a medium a week or two ago and it was too loose so I posted it back and have just been given the code to order another.

I‚Äôve been wearing just those nike sports bra/crops for a while now but I think I‚Äôm usually a 10DD or 12D size wise (32DD or 34D in US sizes).

I‚Äôd like the 975 because it‚Äôs more comfortable, I already know what size I need, it has a lower neckline and I think it would be more breathable (preferable as we‚Äôre moving into summer here).

Also, sometimes I think I do like my chest and I‚Äôm a little worried about sagging. It seems likely that once I get it I‚Äôm going to want to wear it all the time, especially if it‚Äôs
comfortable. I almost always want a flat chest under clothes but I think I actually like my breasts sometimes when I‚Äôm topless (I kind of feel like an art piece? Anyway, not relevant haha).

I‚Äôd like the tri-top 983 because of the compression. It seems like I might need it to get the effect that I‚Äôm hoping for. I‚Äôm a bit worried that there‚Äôs no point getting a binder if I **don‚Äôt** choose this one. As mentioned, I‚Äôm used to wearing sports bras which have some level of compression, and I‚Äôm investing in a binder because I‚Äôd like to try something new and more compress-y. That said, if I got this one and it was really uncomfortable and I was worried about sagging, I would probably wear it less and alternate with the sports bras.

TL;DR: Does anyone have experience with both or either binder? Compression, comfort, visibility under clothes, rolling up, getting itchy, anything that has been important for you :)
Also, any thoughts in general are very welcome!

about five years ago i came out to my mom in the target parking lot. i told her i was ftm trans and bisexual. she basically flat out told me i wasn‚Äôt. she said that she knew a lot of friends when she was a kid that were gay, bi, and lesbian and told all these stories about how they all grew out of it. i was too shaken, anxiety ridden and terrified of my mother to say anything, to at least let her know that these things aren‚Äôt up for debate and i wasn‚Äôt asking for her opinion on whether she thinks i‚Äôm bluffing.

i wound up coming out to my school as trans male and went by he/him and a chosen name i no longer use. it was a hell of a battle to convince them to let me socially transition without notifying my parents. it felt like hell to walk on egg shells the entire year and live in constant fear of my teachers or friends slipping up. by the end of the year i found myself hating my name. not so much the pronouns but i was tired of the chosen name. i took this as my mother being right and me not actually being trans. we moved to a different state at the end of that year and i stopped using the name and pronouns, went back to my birth name and she/her, shoved myself back in the closet.

fast forward five years later i finally figured it out. i feel the same, i just have different and more accurate words to describe how i feel. i‚Äôm not bi, i‚Äôm queer. i like guys, girls, and everything in between. i‚Äôm non-binary transmasc. i still like he/him but they/them is okay too. i have a new chosen name that i like a lot more. i came out to my friends over the summer and my school at the beginning of this year. all of my friends accepted me. i had my entire GSA club to back me up. 

i still have to come out though. i‚Äôm not old enough to move out, as i‚Äôm a sophomore in high school. i cannot take it anymore, i am so tired of hiding myself out of fear of my mother and her reaction. i know my dad will accept me but i have to tell her first. if i tell him, the first thing he‚Äôs gonna ask is what my mother thinks about it. and when he finds out what she thinks about it he‚Äôs gonna throw a shit fit and i‚Äôm gonna get the worst of it. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do about my mom. she refuses to accept trans people and says it‚Äôs fake and she‚Äôs also really homophobic, even though she says she‚Äôs not. she‚Äôll say she doesn‚Äôt mind gay people and then turns around and talks about how disgusting they are. my best idea is to fill my therapist in on all of this and hopefully sit my mom down in her office and talk to her about it in a controlled environment where we can both be heard and talk without getting interrupted. my mom tends to get extremely heated and only cares about what she has to say during arguments. i think a referee would be good for her, especially when this is a moment where i need her to listen more than ever.

however, i was always very confused about pansexuality. i think i‚Äôm still bisexual, but recently i‚Äôve been wondering what labels come in. 

recently, i‚Äôve been crushing on this nb person at my school. but in the beginning i assumed they were a girl, but they have come out to me as nb. it didn‚Äôt really affect how i looked at them, bc i still really really like them. 

the problem is that i think this goes under bisexuality??? but i‚Äôm not sure. bc people talk about polysexual and that sort of stuff, but it doesn‚Äôt resonate w me as much as bisexuality does. bc i still have a preference...

i hope this doesn‚Äôt sound offensive bc i actually don‚Äôt know T^T

i just need help figuring out if the bisexuality label is okay. i‚Äôve been looking at lesbians who like cis girls and nb as well and it‚Äôs still very confusing to me. most people say its not really wrong, bc people‚Äôs preferences can be a spectrum, but it‚Äôs still pretty confusing bc i kinda want to know whats going on with me. 

i also need help on figuring out if i do like femme? nb. i haven‚Äôt looked into the spectrum of nb but people are saying femme nb which i‚Äôm assuming is people who are more femme/present femme. my crush is very neutral, but they don‚Äôt like fem things like dresses and stuff. but, i wouldn‚Äôt call them more masculine either. so i don‚Äôt know if this is a preference including a certain type of nb. 

i also have been trying to learn more about nb bc i really like this person and want to do the right thing. i‚Äôm sure this situation has occurred before, so let me know if i should know anything about nb people to make them feel safe and valid. 

again i hope i wasn‚Äôt offensive in this. i‚Äôm really open minded to hear what i should do or say, or if i am saying smth wrong. nb is not new to me, but i think it‚Äôs more than i thought it was.

I‚Äôm afab in my late 20s and I pretty recently came to the realization that I‚Äôm nonbinary. Things I get dysphoric about are my hips (super wide), my reproductive system, and my genitals. My chest doesn‚Äôt really give me dysphoria, but I do wish I had a smaller chest size because it feels too feminine with the size it is now. I often wear a binder, but I want them to be small so I can bind more easily but also have some shape if I want to go without the binder and am feeling more feminine. But I‚Äôm getting off topic here. The biggest thing that gives me dysphoria is my bottom situation. 

My entire life it‚Äôs just never felt right. I remember being really young, like maybe 7 or 8, and stuffing things inside my pants like socks or washcloths because it felt right. I would also try to make homemade STP devices because I really wanted to be able to pee standing up. When I started masturbating I couldn‚Äôt touch myself because it didn‚Äôt feel right. Not because I was afraid to masturbate, but because it just didn‚Äôt feel like the right parts. So I would do it over my clothing or just by humping something. The only time I could ever orgasm was when I imagined that I had a penis. Anytime I thought about my biological anatomy it just always turned me off. 

I was always very confused by this because I didn‚Äôt feel like a boy, and I didn‚Äôt feel like a girl either but rather something in between, but having a penis felt right to me. So when I came out as liking women at 15, I just thought somehow it was because I was gay. But then when I was around 20, I discovered the term nonbinary, and it made sense. It felt like that fit my description. So I talked to my friend about it, and she was just really confused since this was 2012 and there was no nonbinary representation anywhere, and it wasn‚Äôt even really talked about. So she had no idea what I was talking about and kept asking me if I was androgynous. Then I felt super weird and just was like, ah nevermind and pushed all that stuff down. I just told myself that I was a woman and that was that. 

But of course, ignoring your identity only lasts so long. So now I‚Äôve opened it all back up and where I was able to just ignore it before, everything is too difficult to ignore now. Now when I get dysphoria, because I know that I have the option to change parts of the outside to fit the inside a little better, it‚Äôs harder to deal with the things that feel wrong. Sometimes I‚Äôm not thinking about my bottom situation, but when I do it hits really hard and it‚Äôs almost unbearable. I have a really nice 4 in 1 packer that helps sometimes, and masturbating with it is amazing, but sometimes it‚Äôs not enough and I just want a real penis. And I‚Äôll literally sob because it feels so wrong having just empty space, and I don‚Äôt always get that mental connection with the packer feeling like my own body part. Maybe one day I‚Äôll get a meta, but I‚Äôd need to go on T first and get some bottom growth, and I‚Äôm not even sure if I want to go on T because I really don‚Äôt want my voice to change. I like what it is now, and I‚Äôm a singer and don‚Äôt want that to change. T would help some things, but it would take away some others that I like about my body. So I‚Äôm really torn on that.

I am the creator/facilitator of the Gender Expansive Meetup (GEM) group at my college. Every week we come together in a safe space to discuss gender identity related topics. In effort to make sure we address a variety of experiences, I would like to know what YOU would want to talk about in this setting. Here is the list I have so far:

* How to Explain your Identity
* Names
* Pronouns
* Presentation
* Medical Care
* Makeup to Feminize/Masculinize 
* Sexuality's Relationship to Gender
* History of Gender Expansive Identities
* Modern Non-Western 
* Identifying with Multiple Genders
* Identifying as Agender
* How to Navigate Dating
* How to Handle Dysphoria
* Gender Inclusive Companies
* Binding, Stuffing, Packing, Tucking

Please comment with any other suggestions you have! One thing to note is that we have zero funding, so I cannot bring in guest speakers nor do any activities that require buying things.

My sister in laws BF always notices my outfits after like 4 hours together, but anyway that\'s side.\n\nI\'m helping my FIL take out the trash and some kids walk by and a girl turns around and says, ""are you wearing leggings?"" I said yes and they have pockets! My FIL turns around to them and say, ""You like em?"" And they just turned around and walked away.

I'm AFAB and have thought of myself as ""mostly girl"" for quite some time now. I've been doing some soul-searching for the past week or so, and once I started genuinely thinking of myself as nonbinary, I started feeling... better? I see all the pictures on here, and some of them feel like goals or something to be envious of.

I have spent so, so much of my life feeling odd and existing in a space adjacent to reality. I can't ever pick favorites of anything. I've never felt any connection to my IRL name. I've had several incidents where people were unsure of my gender, and they felt really great. I remember them fondly.

I've spent so much time feeling jumbled and messy and lost, for seemingly no reason. Nothing I've ever been able to pinpoint. Just restlessness, anxiety, depression--you name it.

But looking at this sub and other trans/enby subs has calmed the angry spirit inside of me, the spirit that has been waging war with itself for so long. I've even been described as an angry person before, even though I'm really not.

Like turning a maelstrom into a rainbow, a tiger into a house cat, a scribble into a mural.

It was dysphoria. Dysphoria is what has kept me restless and unstable.

So here I am. I'm a demigirl.

A demigirl has two genders, typically. One is being a girl/woman/female. The other one varies for each person. Mine is an androgyne (maybe agender?).

I'm still figuring things out, of course. But this has been a really productive week in self-discovery.

Because I'm AFAB, and being a demigirl isn't a big enough difference for cis people to understand, I will most likely never be able to come out.

I wore my binder for the entire weekend too, which felt great because I haven‚Äôt been able to bind extensively for a while due to rib pain (but somehow I made it through all three days of con with no negative effects).

On Friday a fellow they/them nonbinary person came to say hello and very excitedly asked to take a selfie with me. I added them on discord, too.

On Saturday a cosplayer came up and gushed at me for being so out and open about my identity and told me I looked amazing. I stupidly didn‚Äôt ask if they were nonbinary as well but their comments made me beam even if I was kinda shy about it.

On Sunday a person I highfived in the entry queue apparently yelled ‚Äúyou‚Äôre valid‚Äù? I totally missed it because I‚Äôm a space case and also sometimes my hearing isn‚Äôt the greatest, but my boyfriend brought it up later in the day and I was like ‚Äúwait, really?‚Äù

1580,2019-10-28 17:13:57,dobuf2,7,11,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile, I'll try to fix it tonight on my laptop.

So I have been battling with the shitty topic that is gender for about two years now. At first I thought I was a trans girl, then I thought I was cis, but about two months ago I finally felt comfortable with identifying as non-binary. Yay!

So before I get into the recent events, I'd like to give a bit of backstory. I'm bisexual, and I have been for several years. I came out to my family last June to a mostly positive response, but I told my sister in March for two reasons: 1) to get a general feel for how the rest of my family would react, and 2) my sister is the most important person in the world to me, and I love her with all of my heart, so it's natural to want to tell her first.

When I told the rest of my family, my mother threw a huge fit at me because I didn't ""trust her enough"" to come out to her first. She was ""really hurt"" and didn't talk to me for about two days. Afterwards, she said she'll be happy for me to be with whoever I want to be and she will always support me. Well, talk is cheap.

Now, on to the recent events. Last weekend, I was talking with some friends who I'm out to about when I should come out as NB to my family, since I would love to be able to present and dress less masc. One person suggested I do it the following week (last week at the time of this posting), so I agreed for Wednesday. My mom was off of work that day and I have an early class, so I had the whole day to figure out what I would say to her.

Wednesday night, I go in her room and tell her I need to talk to her. Fast-forward about 10 minutes, I tell her that I identify as non-binary and to keep it on the down-low from the rest of the family for a while. She's a bit confused by it all but agrees to respect my privacy. She refused to use my chosen name ""Chris"" over my birth name because ""I've been calling you that for twenty years"" and still uses he/him, but... we can work on that, right?

Jump ahead to Saturday, my mother was getting ready to go to a party. She comes into my room to say goodbye to me, and I ask her if she has any questions about me being NB. She says not right now, since she's been talking to my sister trying to figure things out. I ask her why she told my sister when I explicitly told her to not tell anyone else. She said she didn't think it was that big of a deal, and we got in a short argument about it before she left.

I texted my sister about it and she said she was ""extremely hurt that I didn't tell her myself"" that I was NB. I couldn't believe she was turning it around on me, so I asked her if she was being serious. We got in an argument over text and that didn't end well either.

My sister isn't responding to my calls or texts, and my mother is refusing to acknowledge my presence. To my knowledge, the rest of my family (two aunts and grandmother) don't know I'm NB, so they've been acting like normal. They just assumed my mother and I got in a fight. Was it wrong of me to get offended over my mother telling my sister?

**TL;DR**: I came out to my mom as NB, told her to keep it between us. She told my sister, I told my mother that broke my trust in her and made me upset. My sister is defending my mother's choice about telling her and is spinning it around on me for not telling her first. Neither my mother nor my sister will talk to me now.

Due to this I had people keep on saying I'll grow out of it.  \n\nFast forward to middle and I'm still a nerd and preteen me wants to fit in.  I'm still feeling the disconnect to my gender so I like any stupid kid took to anime for support. Since in anime boobs were seen to bring you joy I  thought i would be happy with boobs. This is not the case because not only do I hate my DD milk sacks but I also despise my pireod. Like I feel like I'm a useless sack of meat for menstruating and I should die because of it.\n\nAnyway I'm really struggling with this. I'm scared of what might happen if I'm wrong and if I am nonbinary I know that I'll be disowned by eveyone in my family. My family isn't the best but they're all I have and l don't want to lose that.

1625,2019-10-29 12:41:19,dop87g,9,8,"I'm and nb business consultant and I've recently started chatting with a friend who works in fashion design about the possibility of starting a clothing store that focuses on gender nonconformity, gender-bending, and androgeny.

One of the problems I have had, being 40, is that most of the nonbinary designs that are out there focus on younger people whose fahion needs are different than my own. So, a big part of our discussions have been around how to diversify the availability of nb fashion to appeal to people who are struggling with their body shape, their personal style, or even just finding a store that makes them feel welcome.

The issue we are currently having is deciding what type of design would work best. As a designer, they like the idea of focusing on higher end, more bespoke or customised clothing. I, on the other hand, have been more interested in more accessible clothing that could appeal to a broader group of people who maybe don't have the money to spend on a more expensive outfit that they couldn't wear every day.

Market research hasn't turned up much - the limited number of fashion places focused on this market seem to be in a weird place where they want to take advantage of people with niche fashion needs by overcharging for somewhat boring products. So, I thought that I would ask here, if anyone was interested, in what your fashion needs are?

What sort of a shop would make you feel more welcome? What types of clothing would you like to have more access to? Would you be interested in a curated collection of items from other brands that were chosen specifically for their suitability to diverse body shapes and gender roles, or would you rather see clothing that was specifically designed to target nb folks (as opposed to designs that are gender-focused but could be appropriated into a non-conforming look)?

Any thoughts you'd feel comfortable sharing would be appreciated.

We're aware that the huge increase in membership and activity has overwhelmed the front page with selfies, and that this isn't everyone's cup of tea. From the number of upvotes and comments, however, it's clearly a big draw of the sub and we'd like to keep those interactions while trying to make it a little easier for the sub to also serve other purposes. 

If you would like to view the sub without selfies, a quick and dirty way to do this is by c/ping the following into the search bar:

https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/search?q=subreddit%3Anonbinary+NOT+flair%3A%22Image%22+&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all

This will show you all the posts without an ""Image"" flair, sorted by new. Coming next year, we hope to implement custom filters, but as a word of warning, those only work if you have custom themes allowed. The custom search parameters will work regardless of which reddit you use, your site preferences, or platform. 

We've been collecting the requests and suggestions that come in, and sometime soon we will also be overhauling the sidebar.

(Sorry for any grammar/ortography mistakes, as english isn't my first language, it can be a bit rusty)

Giving some context, I've got this history teacher who always, when he talks with the class, what is lot, says about some themes as feminism, LGBTQ+, racism, social issues, reality, depression, adolescence and others in a really well rounded and based way. He is probably my favorite teacher this year, and in some sense, giving the fact that I already've gotten some counseling from him, I trust him.

So, I'm non-binary, specifically demigender, and bisexual. About my sexuality, I'm out of the closet, even to my parents. Some of my friends know about my gender, most not, but in those past two years (I'm yet 15yo) I've done a pretty good job on getting to understand and accept more myself. On this case, thank you Levy (it's not their real name) for being this amazing enby friend of mine.

Now to the actual thing,

while I was talking with Levy, I got this taught: ""Wait, teachers should be able to help and counsel students? Right?"". We live in Brazil, and here people have a really big bias against the LGBTQ+ community, and I was really needing counseling from an adult recently, as everyone who knew was around my age, or a bit older, and this teacher instantly came to my mind. Levy was like ""OH NO, AREN'T YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING?!?"", and I was like ""Yeah"".

So, one week past and I was in a really bad day. Disphoria was killing me, I was sad with some of my friends and colleagues, so I was like, ""Why not?"". Then his lesson came, and at the end I asked him if I could speak with him at the pause, and he went, ""Come, speak now"".

My head was on full speed, and we went out of the classroom to talk in privacy cause I asked, then, I said, looking down, fearful and going all in this bet: ""So, I'm not a man, nor a woman..."". He was like ""Didn't expect this"", but he took a breath and started to talk calmly.

First he calmed me down, and asked how I saw myself, if someone knew, and many other well done questions, without getting agressive or disrespectful even once. 3 minutes pass and he starts saying things that I really should know, and I was just so bad to notice it.

That I'm really well, in the sense of in a good way.

He made me notice that, for having people who know and support me, having someone, even if only a cousin to count on in my family, to already have accepted myself as non binary, while others struggle to even know this, and other many other things that really made me think how I'm really well, when I could just have done everything wrong. He also said that he could keep talking to me when I needed, man, this dude is awesome.

In this time he once said ""You're a really intelligent boy"", and instantly he stopped and asked if he should call me this way, or which pronoun to use in a very polite way. I said that I don't have problems, and any of them are ok. He even recomended me to talk to a transmasc high school student on the school (which I already talk, ha) and a documentary about a non binary person.

That day I also went for the first time to gym, random thing but a win to me.

One day passes (it's today), and I'm like, insanely happy going crazy with Levy. His class comes (we have classes with him twice a week) and while he class, he says ""voc√™s, meninos, meninas... e meninxs"", it has no direct translation to english, but would be some thing like ""you, boys, girls... and (insert gender neutral equivalent)"", an then he looks to me. Man, I instantly got red, nobody in the class got the meaning of this, but me and Levy. I looked to them and they were like, laughing to me, I was laughing, which is rare. Ok it actually isn't the best way to refer to nb persons, as it's hard to speak, and mainly for blind people to understand using a programm to read on cellphones, but even I didn't know that until some time ago, and it stills valid, as it shows that he cares about how I'm feeling and how I see myself.

This alone made two of my last days incredibly amazing. It's too good to know that, even slowly, things are going well and I'm starting to go out of the closet. Me and Levy are planning to out ourselves to our friends on the nb day on the pride month next year, but we still don't know.

It hasn't been an issue, but today they were feeling major dysphoria. My question is, how can I help them? Is there anything I can do or do I just be a silent support? I love them so much and it breaks my heart to hear them cry that they'll never get to be a pretty girl. To me, they are the most beautiful girl, handsome man, and attractive person I've ever met. How do I help them feel that way?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Help with NB partner', 'created': 1572516432.0}"

So I've been using minoxidyl alongside finasteride estrodial and spiro, and I just used my last bottle up today. I'm planning on not continuing to use it, and I'm wondering if I will see any hair loss. My T Levels have dropped significantly since starting HRT, and I figured the finasteride has been doing all the recent hair growth I've seen in the past year along with E. I clarified with one of the doctors I'm seeing and he said that he totally could do this considering I have the other medications in my system, but might shed a little or experience a little loss.

Just wondering from any other MTF people out there if this is true, and what their experiences have been.

I stopped having parties when I was thirteen, upon realizing that my extreme comfort came from a nasty dysphoria. I hated being called a girl, gifted makeup and nail polish, asked about boyfriends, etc etc. 

My parents pushed, but ultimately relented when I reminded them how their families viewed queer folk. Fighting them on my sixteenth birthday was hell, but they left me alone even then; I know they‚Äôre ashamed of me, and it works to my advantage, here. 

Well. Usually, at least. 

My mom decided, in deference to my recent graduation and upcoming birthday, she was going to hold a party. A huge party, with ‚Äúa surprise you‚Äôre gonna love‚Äù, and invite the infamously transphobic side of the family. 

She‚Äôs not supportive, not really. I think she tries, sometimes, to use the right name at least. Mostly, she just pretends that it‚Äôll go away if she ignores it hard enough. 

The last big surprise was name brand makeup. The last time I saw this side of the family, I had to hide in the bathroom stall for hours, crying and bleeding because my cousins decided they could beat the sin  out of me. If I see a banner with my deadname on it, I‚Äôm going to lose my fucking mind. 

I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm hurt. I‚Äôm clingy with my friends and sensitive to the point of constant tears with everyone that comes near me. I haven‚Äôt been this low since I tried to OD a few years ago, and I hate that it‚Äôs such a petty, stupid thing bringing me to it. 

Even if she gets my name right, my father is going to start a fight over it. His family will start a fight over it. If I wanted a party, I could‚Äôve rounded up my friends and gone to a park with half the drama. 

There‚Äôs no point to this. There really isn‚Äôt. I just ,,, needed to get it out. I‚Äôve cried everyday for a week and my weight is starting to drop again, and I‚Äôm exhausted.

However, there is one main issue that continues to bother me on an almost daily basis and it is the fact that being part spanish and part italian I have inherited rather coarse body hair. I shave on a bi daily basis ( every 2 days not twice a day lol ) but that usually results on irritated skin and ingrown hairs regardless of how gentle I try to be or how much I moisturize or care for my skin after. I also tried waxing which definitely lasts longer but it is rather painful and it can be rather pricy as well. I‚Äôve been really interested in laser hair removal but many of the places that I have researched and that were recommended by my dermatologist are actually very expensive and being a student working a basic entry level job I‚Äôm too broke to afford the laser sessions.

Please let my know if this post is not allowed or disrespectful and I‚Äôll delete my post. My intentions are only good.

I am a screenwriter looking to write a shortfilm about the struggles of a young trans girl in middle school.

I am very passionate about transgender rights and acceptance which is why I want to write this film.

I‚Äôm from Denmark and here it‚Äôs still a battle to get people to see that sex and gender are two different things. Every once and a while a news article will pop up with parents defending and supporting their trans child and every single time people come after them, saying that it‚Äôs unethical to cross-dress a child etc. They simple don‚Äôt understand what being a trans person means and that there is a gender and sexuality spectrum to just name a few. And it outrages me as I‚Äôm - like I said - very passionate about spreading the understanding and support of all kinds of people, genders and sexualities across my country, if not the world to the best of my abilities. Simply put, I want this film to matter and hopefully make a difference.

So I come to you, humbly asking if you will guide me. Tell me about the struggles you face or have faced throughout your life.

I‚Äôm particularly interested in hearing the trial and tribulations of those of you who at an early age discovered that you were trans. How did you find out? How did people and your parents react? Were you accepted or shunned? What‚Äôs your life like today?

But all stories are welcomed. I‚Äôm sure I can learn a lot from all of you.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I hope to hear from you soon and you are free to DM me if you‚Äôd prefer your story to be private.

But it is out there now, I am out there, and as scary as it can be, it feels like a huge weight taken off of my shoulders. I don‚Äôt have to hide myself anymore, and though the road is long, at least I can start moving now.üíóüíóüíó', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Told my Wife today', 'created': 1570161862.0}"

199,2019-10-05 07:34:54,ddk3fp,10,7,"I'm sure this question has been asked a million times, but I hope it's okay for me to ask it again anyway. I wanted to add a little personal detail, so here's my story in a sort of brief summary:

I started crossdressing when I was around 12 or so. I don't have any sisters, so all I had available was my mother's clothes. It was around that age when I first started being allowed to be home alone and whenever I was, I'd rush straight to my mom's wardrobe to dress up. I loved those times! Later, when I was around 18, I moved out to live on my own. I didn't have any female clothing, so there wasn't much dressing happening in that period of time.

A few years later still, when I was around 20, I moved in with my girlfriend, who I am still with today. It didn't take long before I started dressing up in her clothes whenever I was home alone. That went on for years, with me dressing up occasionally, when I had the chance. It could be months without dressing, but I always got back to it eventually.

It wasn't until about 5 years ago, when I was 28 or 29 that I finally came out to my girlfriend. There was some rough weeks after that, where she had to think things over, but we stayed together. She just didn't want anything to do with my crossdressing. She accepts that I do it when I'm alone, but she doesn't want to see or know about it. I had been buying some female clothing on my own before coming out to my girlfriend and have bought lots more after coming out, but it's all still hidden behind my male clothes in my wardrobe.

Now, the thing is that it can still be months without me dressing and then there can be months where I want to dress up all the time. Usually it's during the summer that I don't dress up, both because I'm a bit shy of showing myself with shaven legs in shorts as a male, but I've been thinking if it's maybe also because I'm happier during summer? I like summer and enjoy the long, bright days. When autumn comes, I start shaving my body again and dressing up more, so maybe crossdressing is just something to keep my mind happy during the dark days of the year?

On the other hand, when I look at all the beautiful women over at r/transtimelines I can't help but to think: God I wish that was me! I'm sure most here have had thoughts like that, but does that make me trans? Again, it can be months where I hardly think about it, but then at other times, I feel sad and almost depressed (not a word to use lightly, I know) about it. I'm really in such a period now, for sure. I just feel uncomfortable in my own skin and hate the reflection I see in the mirror. Shaving my body helps, as it takes some of the masculinity away somehow, but I still - obviously - see a man in the mirror when I'm naked and that makes me sad.

I've often thought about transitioning, starting hormones and such, but I don't think I'll ever have the courage. Maybe that makes my question pointless, but I'd still like to know how those of you who *did* start transitioning found out that it was the right thing to do. Maybe it's inevitable and the fact that I haven't done it yet is proof enough that I'm not trans? It's also just really rough for me right now, when going through this period where basically all I think of is wanting to be a woman. I just can't help but to think that if it hadn't been for the internet and seeing all these other trans women, I would have never had had these thoughts to begin with? I don't mean any offense to anyone by that, but maybe, if I hadn't know transition was an option, I wouldn't have even thought about it?

About 1-2 months ago I came to terms with me being trans. I was on extreme denial. It wasn't until yesterday that I had told anyone about it though. And while I have literally no way to present as femme, I'm happy ive at least acknowledged it. It explains alot in my life.

At the moment I'm 16. I live with my parents, both transphobic, extremely conservative individuals who live in the middle of nowhere in rural, racist country. They don't respect my free will when it comes to my body, and seem to believe that material objects make up for emotional neglect.

I can't go to therapy (when I almost committed suicide they just screamed at me for doing so and proceeded to do nothing else), If I get any grades under their standards I'm just booted away until I fix it, exc you know what the issue is here. 

Well, to test the waters I tried to explain to them about 2 months ago that I'm bisexual. Yeah, didn't go well. Made it for 13 hours with that whole ""We'll always love you"" speech.

The highlights of our fight include: being told I've never been in a ""real"" relationship, being told all my friends are deliquents, that all the LGBT kids at my school should be killed in some way, being told that I'm not old enough to make these decisions, being yelled at for ending things with an outwardly transphobic asshole of a ""friend"", and the whole ""biological grandchildren"" speech garbage.

As well as the constant reminders every week or so of how much it upsets them, but whatever.

Well, now we're here. Obviously I can't say anything until I move out. But here's the issue. For one thing, I don't know any way to get to college short of earning a degree (which is possible) without financial support from my parents. If I do this, obviously I will be disowned, or cut off, exc. And I'm not going to wait any longer. I'm moving out as soon as I'm 18, and I'm going to get myself set up with a doctor. I won't pass up my 10 year puberty window for their stupid fucking ideals.

As well as that, I want to move away. Like, far away. And I don't know if any jobs in my area will accept me as a worker if I'm trans. Everyone is an asshole. So I don't know how the hell I'll get money to do any of this. My job I'm working at now is only minimum wage, and I think all I can get working there is around 30,000 once I'm done with it *if I'm lucky*.

Hell, I don't even know where to go to get hrt, bottom surgey, exc.  And at the moment I'm doing some extreme weight loss in preparation (I weigh alot.) And it's stressing me out. I don't know what to do here..

How do I split off from them and start HRT? How do I start college without financial support if I need to? That's my two biggest fears. I don't see a way to have both.

For those unfamiliar, Les Blank is a widely known and respected documentary filmmaker for ""Garlic is as Good as Ten Mothers"", Gap-Toothed Women"" and ""The Blues According to Lightin' Hopkins.""

Les' son Harrod has continued his father's work, most notably with the art car documentary ""Wild Wheels.""

Harrod's latest film is a portrait of Rusty Tidenberg, a brilliant car mechanic and professional racer until he came out at 53, getting breast implants and openly wearing women's clothes.

""What Can't I Be Me? Around You"" examines Rusty's struggles to be herself, to be accepted as herself and to ultimately find love.

Screenings are pretty limited, and this wonderful film needs all the attention it can get.

Here is the current schedule:

Oct 11 9:15 pm at Colligan Theater, Santa Cruz Film Festival

Oct 12 at 8:15pm at the Lark Theatre in Larkspur, part of Mill Valley Film Festival

Oct 12 at 4:45pm at the UCSC Communications Bldg., Santa Cruz Film Festival

Oct 16 at 5:30pm at Jean Cocteau Cinema at the Santa Fe Independent Film Fest

Oct 18 at 5:45pm in Theater 11, at the Orlando Film Festival

All I ever wanted was to be a teacher, to support kids and help people achieve what they deserve. It‚Äôs an extremely hard job, it‚Äôs taken it‚Äôs toll on me and now I can‚Äôt handle it anymore.

I‚Äôve exhausted all my options to fund my surgery, I have to have it before 2020 summer or I can‚Äôt renter the classroom.

Anything you can do or say or help me share this so I can finally be who I am suppose to be and get back to doing what I love in education.

The passage, while not really unsupportive of trans people gave an uncorroborated anecdote about getting banned on /r/ActualLesbians ""for not wanting to fawn over 'girldick.'"" 

Now maybe it's just me, but I've never found this to be true. It gets brought up now and again, but every time someone has asked ""Is it okay to call myself a lesbian if I'm not interested in trans people?"" the consensus was ""Yes, it is!"" And I (a trans person) entirely agree. All that matters to me is that people are supportive--or at the very least, not invalidating to trans women in lesbian circles. There's no need to be attractive to me, and I haven't actually seen anybody in /r/AL disagree there.

Nonetheless, all of a sudden it's a *thing* and I guess I never noticed it was a *thing*. Anyways, now people are getting cheerfully invited to /r/GenderCritical and /r/TrueLesbians.

Like:

&gt; [I was just banned from /r/AL]. I expressed that it is an expression of rape culture for lesbians not to want to date women who have genitals of biological men. I think problematic trans women in the community are forgetting that they were raised as biological men and thus subject to sociological conditioning to feel entitled to women sexually.

In other words:

&gt; I was banned because I think that all these vague and unsubstantiated strawmen think they can do whatever they want to a woman and believe they deserve to be able to rape women and why aren't we doing anything about these people that definitely exist!

There's more genuinely awful shit in this thread that I really shouldn't be reading. What bothers me is that, generally speaking, everyone is agreeing with a pretty reasonable and vague concept. Yes, nobody is expected to date me for any reason, even if they're attracted to women.

The passage, while not really unsupportive of trans people gave an uncorroborated anecdote about getting banned on /r/ActualLesbians ""for not wanting to fawn over \'girldick.\'"" \n\nNow maybe it\'s just me, but I\'ve never found this to be true. It gets brought up now and again, but every time someone has asked ""Is it okay to call myself a lesbian if I\'m not interested in trans people?"" the consensus was ""Yes, it is!"" And I (a trans person) entirely agree. All that matters to me is that people are supportive--or at the very least, not invalidating to trans women in lesbian circles. There\'s no need to be attractive to me, and I haven\'t actually seen anybody in /r/AL disagree there.\n\nNonetheless, all of a sudden it\'s a *thing* and I guess I never noticed it was a *thing*. Anyways, now people are getting cheerfully invited to /r/GenderCritical and /r/TrueLesbians.\n\nLike:\n\n&gt; [I was just banned from /r/AL]. I expressed that it is an expression of rape culture for lesbians not to want to date women who have genitals of biological men. I think problematic trans women in the community are forgetting that they were raised as biological men and thus subject to sociological conditioning to feel entitled to women sexually.\n\nIn other words:\n\n&gt; I was banned because I think that all these vague and unsubstantiated strawmen think they can do whatever they want to a woman and believe they deserve to be able to rape women and why aren\'t we doing anything about these people that definitely exist!\n\nThere\'s more genuinely awful shit in this thread that I really shouldn\'t be reading. What bothers me is that, generally speaking, everyone is agreeing with a pretty reasonable and vague concept. Yes, nobody is expected to date me for any reason, even if they\'re attracted to women.

For example, when it first happened for me, I started to feel as if there was something wrong with me around the sixth grade, however there were obviously signs of it before then. I preferred friends of the opposite sex, didn't want to play games or sports that were considered 'masculine' or mostly associated with boys, a lot of times I had dreams or fantasies about suddenly changing and becoming a girl, and around the time that puberty was in full swing, I cracked and realized I wasn't comfortable as a boy. 

After sixth grade, the desire to be something else, something more, just, strengthened. It progressed to longing to change my sexual organs, grow breasts, and have a more supple/feminine face. I was only really comfortable in the presence of persons of the opposite, or I guess the same, gender. 

Except it progressed beyond mostly physical reasons. With the subtle and major differences in culture between men and women, I noticed there was something off about how I felt. I enjoyed femininity, I always preferred and looked up to female characters in media, I always had more of an interest in female-oriented fashion; despite hiding this all from family. The way girls treat other other made me jealous; the way they talk and act, and the intimacy between two friends.

320,2019-10-07 20:44:51,deph1s,2,4,"Today I had the bravery to go and buy a bra (I measured myself before going there and I acted like sameone told me what to buy), I hid it and I waited to be home alone.
Im the meantime my dac called me (my parents are divorced) and, probably because I was really excited to what I had done, I decided to Teel him that I was thinking about myself and my life, and that he didn't need to worry if I acted strange when we meet (I started to grow my hair, my nails, I shave a lot more and I will buy a kit for waxing).

Than, when I was alone, I started to get every minute more excited, I couldn't stop thinking about it, so when the moment arrived, all my excitement vanished.

In that moment I was extremely worried, questions like: 
what if I look dumb and I did all of this for nothing? What if I don't like myself? Sterted appearing in my mind while I was putting it on, I started to shake a little, I don't have clothes for women, but I have things that can be somewhat used as unisex (kinda) but I choose the best I could think and finally I put socks in the bra.

And then I got in front of the mirror.

The first thing that hit me was how all my anxiety was gone, I was completely calm and concentrated on my reflection.
Then a surprisingly sense of normality came.

It was like I always had breasts.

It wasn't strange. It wasn't the euphoria that I read other people experienced. It was just like ""oh yeah, they look like they always belonged there and have always been"".

I was shocked about that.
Of all things I expected, that was the one I didn't thought.

So I started looking for my look in general.
It was fairly normal, like I dress almost every day, but in that moment I noticed how the sweater made me look more fat because it dropped in a strange way on my stomach, how the pants made my legs, that I am really proud because they look like one that a girl would have, look way bigger on the tight that they are.

And than I almost jumped out of the mirror.
I started to though what I felt and why, but without noticing I went on my bed without taking off my bra. It felt so normal that I sttil have it on right now.

But if before I wanted to see how it would look on me, I now don't want to take it off.
I want real girly clothes and long hair and want to look like one.

I feel so happy now, now I understand what I want to look like and my objective is a lot more clear, but the path is still foggy.
I hope that this experience will help me through this journey

340,2019-10-08 04:52:49,devc6s,3,4,"Hey. I'm 19 and still trying to figure shit out. I apologise if this post is confusing, English is my 2nd language. This is going to be a little long and I'd be really grateful if you gave me your thoughts.

A year ago, I started going to therapy because of some personal stuff and depression. My psychologist suggested that the reason I feel disconnected and demotivated is because I don't have a sense of identity and community. I don't know what I like, dislike, what gives me pleasure, angers me, etc, which is true, so I'm trying to understand myself better. One of the things that is bothering me now is how I'm not sure about both my gender and sexuality.

I've always been perceived as a girl and I've always been ok with it. I never stopped to think about it until recently, so no, I don't experience any body dysmorphia. Now that I'm learning more about gender, however, I'm identifying a lot as agender, but as it would be more of a rational choice to identify myself this way, I don't know if that would make me ACTUALLY trans. I don't know how to explain this, but I think you get it. Also, I sometimes think it would be unfair to people that suffer with dysmorphia to put myself in the same place as them, if that makes sense. Being called a girl never bothered me before, but it is starting to make me uncomfortable now, but it'because I'm super confused more than anything else, I think.

Sexuality wise, I'm even more confused. I'm sure I like men the most, but I liked some girls in the past in a romantic way, but never in a sexual way. So I guess I'd be androphilic and biromantic? But isn't that weird? I don't know if there's a reason for that.

I apologise if this post is confusing, English is my 2nd language. This is going to be a little long and I'd be really grateful if you gave me your thoughts.\n\nA year ago, I started going to therapy because of some personal stuff and depression. My psychologist suggested that the reason I feel disconnected and demotivated is because I don't have a sense of identity and community. I don't know what I like, dislike, what gives me pleasure, angers me, etc, which is true, so I'm trying to understand myself better. One of the things that is bothering me now is how I'm not sure about both my gender and sexuality.\n\nI've always been perceived as a girl and I've always been ok with it. I never stopped to think about it until recently, so no, I don't experience any body dysmorphia. Now that I'm learning more about gender, however, I'm identifying a lot as agender, but as it would be more of a rational choice to identify myself this way, I don't know if that would make me ACTUALLY trans. I don't know how to explain this, but I think you get it. Also, I sometimes think it would be unfair to people that suffer with dysmorphia to put myself in the same place as them, if that makes sense. Being called a girl never bothered me before, but it is starting to make me uncomfortable now, but it'because I'm super confused more than anything else, I think.\n\nSexuality wise, I'm even more confused. I'm sure I like men the most, but I liked some girls in the past in a romantic way, but never in a sexual way. So I guess I'd be androphilic and biromantic? But isn't that weird? I don't know if there's a reason for that. Unlike the gender situation, I've questioned my sexuality multiple times before, but never thought it was that important, so I'd just stop thinking about.

I am open to all ideas, and I want clarity on the topic of transgenderism. Below is a comment I left on a youtube video about the science of transgenderism that explains my current view and invites everyone to tell me what I have wrong, and show me what science I am missing. This is NOT a transphobic post, I just want to see what I'm missing. Since the video I left this comment on is over a year old, I thought this would be a better place to find a reply.

Here is the comment:

I have a genuine question:

I was born into a Christian family, raised being fed dogma and lies propagated by the bible and modern Christianity. As a direct result of my conservative Christian environment, I was taught that the LGBT (I know there are more letters in the acronym now, but for the sake of brevity) community was sinful. After leaving my religion 3 months ago due to the mounds of empirical evidence pointing to ideas contrary to the Bible and the lack of evidence for god, I realized that the homosexual community was harmless and Christianity was disgusting for saying the contrary (I already knew it was harmless as a Christian, but I still thought it was a ""sin""). Since de-converting, I've kept my mind open to all ideas be they political, social, or moral, as long as they had sufficient scientific evidence to back them up. And I changed my mind on a lot of things. One thing I have not fully addressed, however, is the idea of transgenderism. I searched ""the science behind transgenderism"" on YouTube to look for evidence to back it up, but this was the only video I could really find on the topic. I found the evidence in this video unsatisfactory. The fact that a person whose assigned sex as a child was male but their brain structure slightly more resembles the female brain doesn't necessarily mean that they are justifiably a female, just that they might have tendencies society has stereotyped as ""feminine"". A male can be feminine in quality and in certain realms of genetic code but still be a male. After watching this video I thought that there must be much more science behind transgenderism with how accepted it has become in the mainstream, including extremely educated scientists. So here I will lay out my current view on the subject, and I invite anyone and everyone to show me any flaws in my current view and point me in the direction of science to back up the validity of transgenderism.

1. A person is a male if they are born with an X and Y chromosome (they have male genitalia) and female if they are born with an X and Y chromosome (they have female genitalia). These are the definitions of male and female.

2. Sex and gender are synonymous. I have heard it espoused that sex is the assigned label at birth based on genitalia and gender is what the person identifies as, but I question the latter.

3. A person's identifying themselves as a member of the opposite sex is misled based on the interests and tendencies they experience which society has taught to be landmarks of the opposite sex. For example: a male liking makeup, or certain types of fashion, etc./ a female liking sports, lifting weights (which fuck yeah, I'm a powerlifter and I'm all for women busting those gender role stereotypes) etc.

4. I DO NOT think a person is less valid for being transgender, only they came to the wrong conclusion because of societal labels. By the way, the conclusion I'm talking about is injecting hormones into your body to become more like the opposite sex and/ or mutilating your existing genitalia because you identify as not having those genitalia.

5. I am hesitant on the topic of pronouns. In my mind, pronouns are based off of sex, aka chromosome status/genitalia at birth. Claiming you are of neither sex (and thus claiming the pronouns they/them) could only be true of a hermaphrodite, and to my knowledge there has never been a hermaphroditic human. I know there are men with micro penises and women with enlarged clitorises, but that is still not neutral.

This is not a hostile assertion against the trans community, just a curious inquiry to those who may have more insight on the subject.

By the way, the conclusion I\'m talking about is injecting hormones into your body to become more like the opposite sex and/ or mutilating your existing genitalia because you identify as not having those genitalia.\n\n5. I am hesitant on the topic of pronouns. In my mind, pronouns are based off of sex, aka chromosome status/genitalia at birth. Claiming you are of neither sex (and thus claiming the pronouns they/them) could only be true of a hermaphrodite, and to my knowledge there has never been a hermaphroditic human. I know there are men with micro penises and women with enlarged clitorises, but that is still not neutral.\n\nThis is not a hostile assertion against the trans community, just a curious inquiry to those who may have more insight on the subject.

I recently found out from one of my friends that another friend is Transgender, entirely by mistake they didnt mean to out them. My friend who is transgender, he hasn't told me but he knows that I would be accepting. I'm gay and we talk about LGBT topics often, I know I've made it clear that I'm 100% fine with transgender people.

I know he isn't obligated to tell me, I'm just bringing up that I know that he knows that I'd be okay.

But pretty much, I feel weird knowing that he is a guy and still referring to him as a 'she'.

Is there anyway I could approach this or ask him about it in a way that's okay? Or should I just wait until he comes out to me.

Obviously I'm NOT the victim here but It's just odd that I know. 
In my opinion, if I was him I would want someone who knew to tell me they knew, it would be heartbreaking to come out and find out that they already knew.

What is the best thing to do in this situation because I do want to be supporting him as well and it sucks that I can't y'know.

Firstly I just want to preface this text to say that the intent of this post is not to be rude, offend or satire or anything other than really trying to understand more.

I live in Ireland and have only ever met 2 Trans women, both at work and both lovely! I chatted to them both about normal stuff but didn‚Äôt want to make them uncomfortable asking questions out of nowhere. They both have since moved jobs.

Firstly, could someone tell me the difference between Transgender and Transsexual? I have looked this up on multiple sites and don‚Äôt always seem to get the same answer. When people say just ‚Äòtrans‚Äô, is this referring to both Transsexuals AND Transgenders?

Secondly (this is more of a thought, but please correct me/point out where my thinking is wrong), is having an ‚Äòassigned‚Äô gender really a harmful thing? (When I say harmful, what I mean is that you sometimes read things where people say it is inappropriate to say your newborn is a girl or boy, as they have not yet chosen their gender.) My view is that, why would we not encourage our children that they were born absolutely perfectly (genitals and all) and regardless of these genitals, they can; be, do, dress, think, act, work and play in any way they see fit? What I am trying to get at is, rather than perform surgery on/give hormones to otherwise healthy children/teenagers to remove their breasts, penis, testes or vagina and replace them, surely they are better to keep what they were born with and instead put all our efforts into reassuring they are exactly enough as they are and then parent them to be whatever they want to be (gay, bisexual, straight, pan sexual in terms of sexuality, any ‚Äòlook‚Äô they want, any career they want etc).

I was on holiday not that long ago and i was really stressed and i didnt swim the whole time (its a island resort thing) my family was worred but i juat couldn\'t stand all those people who were born right.I just need help with what to do. I told my friend today that that\'s how I felt. I think I knew already and the conversation didn\'t last long. He was fine with it. Just... I don\'t want to come out to my family but it\'s... embarrassing I guess. I know that sounds disrespectful to transgender people but that\'s how I feel. I\'m not trying to disrespect anyone. I need help on what to do please. Uhh I\'m considering telling my therapist that I\'m seeing tomorrow. Idk what to do. ((I\'m 13 by the way)) thanks for tanking your time to read this.

I've already tried to make her stop, but she's the stubborn type of person, and won't listen. I finally decided to shave just to make her stop. It feels really weird and I don't like it, but it's better then her being mean. 

My sister's not much of a good person either way.

She used to say it would be cool to have a trans brother, but now that she does, I don't know if she likes it. She's really condescending towards me, like I'm lower then her.

The only things I can think of that are keeping things from happening are that I‚Äôm overweight and maybe it‚Äôs just harder to tell what‚Äôs happening?

There‚Äôs also the inconsistency in the spiro which could have screwed some stuff up maybe.

424,2019-10-09 21:35:11,dfntif,0,0,"Okay, so clearly this is a controversial topic amongst the trans community right now, and it's clear to see why. I figured it might be nice to give/get the opinion of someone who is currently questioning and has seen the video and or the multitude of reaction videos in the YouTube universe right now.

I want to start off by saying that I WILL be using they/them pronouns to refer to Trish, only because I do not want to be offensive if they truly are questioning and not just trolling the community. I am aware that this may not be well recieved as they clearly are ignorant to what being non-binary/gender non conforming is.. but it seems that these would be the best suited pronouns to avoid being hypocritical in the event that Trish truly is in a questioning period in regards to their gender.

With that being said, I must say I found the whole thing quite confusing. That being said, I believe a lot of people found it rather confusing. 

As an afab questioning person myself, I started questioning when I decided to present more masculine, in this way I can KIND OF relate to the parts where they mention feeling ""happier"" when presenting more masculine and having envy over the ease of presentation as a masculine presenting person when they were feeling they had to present feminine. I decided to present myself more masculine because I always envied how ""butch"" women could often make themselves look good with little to no effort if they so choose. They didn't have to worry about having long, annoying, straggley hair.. they could dress for comfort over style and still be attractive.. I'm sounding incredibly vain, I'm aware, please don't judge, just give me a minute to get to my point... Lol 

I STARTED presenting masculine for all of these reasons, but never once questioned my gender because of my decision to dress for comfort over style. Never once did my decision to cut my hair, or dress in traditionally masculine clothing make me feel like it was because I was trans. 

But as butch women often experience, dressing in a more masculine way, presenting myself as a more masculine woman, I found myself getting misgendered. And it made me feel things I never expected. The first time someone misgendered me, my heart came up in my throat and I felt this ""aha"" moment.... I wanted to cry happy tears.. it was like this light switch I didn't even know existed, suddenly came on. And then continued to come on EVERY time after.

It sent me on my journey down the rabbit hole if you will, looking back on my life, looking for other hints or clues I may have overlooked or passed off as being cis-normative behavior.. and I found a good bit, however I still have trouble deciphering if they truly are signs of being trans, or if they're just experiences I've noted that somehow fit the typical ""trans narrative"".. 

I struggle with believing that Trish truly is trans ftm, but I don't know that I believe they made the video maliciously? Like, I believe they may be confused about the terms they've used and what they truly mean, and maybe genuinely are blissfully ignorant on the topic and they're just kind of trying to find where they fit? Idk.. 

Anyways.. I'd be interested to see if anyone else who is questioning has seen the video and what your opinions are, did you find you could relate at all? 

Also this isn't just me looking for other questioning people, those who have found themselves fully and are comfortable in their gender identity, I'd love to hear your opinion as well!!

And then continued to come on EVERY time after.\n\nIt sent me on my journey down the rabbit hole if you will, looking back on my life, looking for other hints or clues I may have overlooked or passed off as being cis-normative behavior.. and I found a good bit, however I still have trouble deciphering if they truly are signs of being trans, or if they\'re just experiences I\'ve noted that somehow fit the typical ""trans narrative"".. \n\nI struggle with believing that Trish truly is trans ftm, but I don\'t know that I believe they made the video maliciously? Like, I believe they may be confused about the terms they\'ve used and what they truly mean, and maybe genuinely are blissfully ignorant on the topic and they\'re just kind of trying to find where they fit? Idk.. \n\nAnyways.. I\'d be interested to see if anyone else who is questioning has seen the video and what your opinions are, did you find you could relate at all? \n\nAlso this isn\'t just me looking for other questioning people, those who have found themselves fully and are comfortable in their gender identity, I\'d love to hear your opinion as well!!\n\nI do ask that we keep the conversation civil, and not name call or bully based on our opinions on the topic. You can disagree, but please keep it civil...

452,2019-10-10 12:41:48,dfxg99,6,5,"I tried to kill myself in early August. Just a week before my 31st birthday. I‚Äôve been suicidal for most of my life so I should have known better than this, but I tried to slit my wrists in the shower. As I sat there waiting to die, I cried and screamed. I didn‚Äôt want it, but the constant pain of being alive was even worse. I was a selfish monster and was simply committing one final selfish act ‚Äî then everything would be fine. Once I realized I did it wrong and I wasn‚Äôt going to die, I was too scared to keep cutting. So I just sat there and cried. I wanted my wife to find me there and pick me up and hold me and tell me everything was going to be okay. She didn‚Äôt. I had told her I was trans and needed to explore it and I thought she‚Äôd accept it and support me. Instead she told me I was a selfish monster who was going to destroy our family and fuck up our child. She was so angry. She was going to leave me and take my daughter and I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. Eventually, I took it back. Just told her I was confused, but that my trans feelings were gone. I really thought they were, but they weren‚Äôt. They were just hiding. Just until the danger passed.

I‚Äôm too old. I‚Äôd transition just in time to become an old crone. I‚Äôll never find anyone to love me. No one ever really has. Not true unconditional love. I dream about meeting a girl who will accept me as I am and make me believe in soulmates again. I dream about becoming myself and finally rediscovering my creative spark. That I will write and paint and play music and do everything I used to love before the world shattered me into a million pieces and I began drifting through life in a dissociative haze. I dream that I can bare my soul to the world and be accepted and loved. But those are just dreams. In the most manic of highs, I believe them. I believe them and know someday I will spend every day dancing in starlight and everything will be beautiful. But then I fall back into darkness. Out of fantasy and back into reality. Ever since I was a small child, my birthday wish every year has been for everything to just ‚Äúturn out okay.‚Äù But nothing is okay and nothing will ever be okay. They‚Äôre just dreams and wishes. I have a lot of wishes.

I wish I had understood sooner my family didn‚Äôt love me and that it wasn‚Äôt my fault. I wish I understood what my father was doing was sexual abuse. I wish I understood it wasn‚Äôt normal to be so afraid of your parents that you regularly hid under your bed. I wish I knew what my father did to my brother to make him grow up to molest children. I wish I could have protected him. I wish I had understood my mother wasn‚Äôt connected to reality and that when she screamed at me, and strangled me, and threw chairs at me, it didn‚Äôt really have anything to do with me. I wish when I blacked out and strangled that boy at school, my teacher had asked what was happening at my home instead of yelling at me and then just dropping it when I couldn‚Äôt remember doing anything. I wish someone had said something when every single square inch of my arms were covered in obvious self-inflicted cuts. Something other than ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù anyway. I wish I hadn‚Äôt given up on high school and dropped out because it was apparent my father was never going to let me leave that awful house no matter what I did. He didn‚Äôt want me to grow up and live my own life. He wanted me there, telling him how wonderful he was and becoming a little copy of him. I had to fight tooth-and-nail just to get my foot out the door.

I wish I didn‚Äôt have to learn to be such a good liar just to keep myself safe. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to teach myself how to smile in the mirror as a child. I wish I had been allowed to be myself. I wish I hadn‚Äôt stopped being vegan because my family was starving me. I wish I hadn‚Äôt given up on my dreams to travel because they said it was unrealistic. I wish I hadn‚Äôt stopped writing fiction and creating art because my parents mocked it relentlessly (while still bragging to everyone about what an artistic, gifted kid they had). I wish I hadn‚Äôt stopped being an anarchist because I was told I was stupid. I wish I understood when they asked me what I wanted to be, they were really just asking how I wanted to sell my labor. I wouldn‚Äôt have answered so honestly and earnestly. I wouldn‚Äôt have been so vulnerable. I wish I‚Äôd run off the moment I turned 18 instead of hanging around and thinking I owed these people something.

I remember the cold distant anger of my father when, as a little boy, I said I wanted to be a girl. I wanted to skip and dance and play with the other girls. I love skipping. I didn‚Äôt like rough-housing with the other boys. I wanted an E-Z Bake Oven more than anything. I wanted the pink Barbie Power Wheels, but I wasn‚Äôt sure why. All I ever got were baseball cards and CDs of music my dad liked. I wish I hadn‚Äôt buried all that. Buried it deeper than anything else about myself. I buried it so deep I forgot it was there‚Ä¶ until it clawed its way out like a furious lich seeking revenge. On fire and screaming and demanding my full attention.

I wish I recognized myself in mirrors. I wish when people asked if I was gay (oh god, I‚Äôve heard that question countless times) and I‚Äôd said no, I‚Äôd have realized an unprompted ten minute follow-up monologue about identifying as male despite not being super masculine was probably worth examining. I wish when my first girlfriend offered to let me try on her skirt when I was 19, I had done it. I was afraid I‚Äôd like it. No. I knew I‚Äôd like it. I so desperately wanted to wear it and twirl with wild abandon. I was afraid of what would happen next. I wish I had listened when my other girlfriends suggested I was‚Ä¶ different. But I‚Äôd deny it and they‚Äôd be relieved. If I became a girl, it would be a ‚Äúwaste of a good cock‚Äù they‚Äôd say. I wish I had better taste in women.

I wish could redo everything. I wish I knew better back then. I wish I knew to fight back. I wish I knew I had been a wonderful person with a bright future who was worthy of love. I wish I understood the people who abused me and tried to destroy me were monsters. But it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôm just an empty shell now, worthy of nothing. 

I wish I had died in that shower.

I wish I didn‚Äôt have a feminine self to apologize to when I told her she had to stay locked away.

She‚Äôs beautiful. I know it. She‚Äôs beautiful and loving and confident and everything I‚Äôve ever wanted to be and I am her and I wish I was her. She isn‚Äôt afraid like I am. She doesn‚Äôt cry like I do. She doesn‚Äôt shut down and sleepwalk through every day. Every year. She‚Äôs vibrant and alive and every fiber of her being is infused with creation. She loves herself and I love her.

I just don‚Äôt want to be alone. Somebody please tell me I‚Äôm not alone. I feel like my life is rapidly coming to an end and I never spent any of it living. I just spent it trying to survive and scrape together some semblance of the stability and safety I never had but so terribly needed and now it‚Äôs all over. All that‚Äôs left is a yawning expanse of decay and withering until I finally gratefully thankfully die. I did everything ‚Äúright‚Äù. I cut all the toxic people out of my life, I got the steady work-from-home job that pays almost six figures, I bought the house in the suburbs, I got married and had a kid (who is the most wonderful, innocent being and I‚Äôm sorry I inflicted existence in this terrible fucking world on her. She deserves better. I‚Äôm ashamed of myself), I started going back to school for creative writing, my first love. I went to therapy and put all my childhood trauma behind me... at least, I thought I did. I did everything I was supposed to do and I did it all with a brain that only half works thanks to autism and ‚Äúdepression‚Äù which I‚Äôm now realizing is bipolar II. Why aren‚Äôt I happy?

However, about a month ago i finally stopped suppressing it, and realised that i was not, nor ever have been happy as a male, and that the hatred i had felt towards myself was misplaced, and that it had destroyed me.

The company I worked for was being bought out, and I had to find a new job.

My family was threatening to disown me if I went forwards. I was constantly unhappy with how I looked. I had a few medical issues that were rearing their head. 

All in all, it was a shit time. I needed space to breathe. I thought finding a new job as a cis man would make everything easier. I figured I could probably carry on living that way too, after all, I'd already done in for 25 years.

I shaved my head, and as I stared at the pile of hair on the floor, I thought things might be ok. I lied to my friends about why I was detransistioning. In reality, it was because I'm a fucking coward.

Now, all the dysphoria has come rushing back. I feel lost and alone and it's getting worse every day. I have no idea how to move forwards.

I'm getting exponentially worse every day, and I can feel a major breakdown coming on. Right now, I just want to climb into bed and stay there until everything bad goes away.

I don't even have any of my clothes or makeup anymore, or the money to replace any of it. I have no outlet to try and curb my dysphoria even a little.

I'm 30, recently out as a trans woman, 3 months into hrt, and all's been well on that front. No idea if I'll ever pursue any surgery, but I know I want my facial hair gone. Bums me out to shave it every day.

I moved from New York to Los Angeles earlier this month. I had been pursuing hair removal options in NY, but held off b/c I was intimidated by the prices (I did one laser consultation and it seemed to be \*way\* out of my budget).

So now I'm looking for options in or near LA. Probably just electro, but I'm open to re-exploring laser if I can find a much cheaper clinic. I've reached out to a number of electro clinics, and looked up a lot of people's individual experiences, but the prices and number of sessions seem to be all over the map; I've read accounts of people who got a dozen sessions, and people who got hundreds and hundreds of sessions. Makes it very hard to estimate cost, among other things. Pretty overwhelming.

So I was wondering if anyone could help provide some clarity or narrow my focus on this. I'm on a grad student budget, uncertain if I'll have an income a year from now, so price is a major factor (not that I have any idea what is or isn't reasonable).

[im sorry if this may be triggering how I explain things I‚Äôm very new to this and I‚Äôm super confused pls don‚Äôt hate]

Me: Shawn He/Him
Scrawny boy, gay, has anxiety

Them: Benji He/they (was Lindsey she/her)
Long-ish hair, almost +sized, feminine body, large breasts

[both 15]

So we both have super religious poor parents. we both go to the same super religion high school. At the first day of school we got our IDs with our photos on them everything‚Äôs great we both have two new friends: Kayla &amp; Saundra. On one day I check out group chat to tho see Lindsey coming out as Trans saying that she‚Äôs scared about her parents. We say we‚Äôre proud of them and everyone (expect me) goes on with their day. I‚Äôm scared tho! 


Why I‚Äôm scared:

 ‚Ä¢ ID has them looking rather girl-like and her body looks like a normal girl. 
‚Ä¢We‚Äôll probably not be able to change our ID photo through those 4 years oh high school
‚Ä¢ everyone knows her, calls her Lindsey, using she/her pronouns
‚Ä¢her parents would never support them
‚Ä¢my parents would never support them
‚Ä¢idk what pronouns to use when they‚Äôre not near my because if I say he or use the name Benji everyone will be confused and ask questions
‚Ä¢ not used to calling them Benji
‚Ä¢I feel like I‚Äôm betraying them if I say Lindsey or use she/her behind her back
‚Ä¢pretty much only their friends will support him
‚Ä¢their parents are too poor to pay for any surgeries they might want
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm scared that this might be a phase and that they‚Äôll do permanent mistakes‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

Today, he got his hair cut very short (I make my kids wait a while before a drastic haircut, because it can't be undone quickly). As I always do, I posted the ""New Haircut"" photo on Facebook. 

One of my best friends, who I haven't seen lately (she's pregnant, which is all we talk about since her positive test), was shocked. I told her that my kid had come out to me as trans, and the haircut was really important to him. Her reaction was basically that my kid is too young and doesn't have the life experience to make that decision, and that I'm a bad parent for going along with it. I'm really surprised and a little hurt by her reaction. This was even after I told her how much better my child's depression has been these past few months, after opening up to me and to my mom (who is very close to my kids).

Roleplaying games have been a big part of my life for years and even before I realized what was up, I always played women to the point where I would avoid games that didn't at least give me the option. Not because I thought the games themselves were bad but because they completely failed to engage me in any meaninful way.

It got a little more serious when I started joining online groups. One of the earliest ones was the RP server for Star Wars: The Old Republic and I interacted with people in character as a woman. Still didn't connect the dots for at least five years but that's besides the point.

Fast forward to present day and I've been playing on one of the private servers for Conan Exiles. I've made great friends there and seen a long and interesting story unfold between all our characters. We've gotten to know each other as people over the months we've spent together.   
What happened was that a previous administrator of the server takes over after over a year of being away. Not the original owner of the server or anything like that but I digress.

He decides to reset the server. Not for any technical reasons that would require a wipe, which we all understand happens from time to time but because he's unhappy with the direction the server has taken. Namely people not really caring much about the aspects of the lore he has written for it. Not ignoring it, as it is cannon on the server, but simply not showing much interest in it and rather continuing the stories we've all been crafting with friends and strangers alike.

He declares years of stories to be null and void as he wants to bring it more in line with his vision.  
Point being, a lot of us feel robbed of some of the best experiences we've had in the game and decide to leave.  


In a discussion about this on a discord server for a lot of the people I know from there, I snap. I feel unreasonably hurt by this and I just ramble on (much like I do now) about how much I do not agree with this. The character I played on this server was the one outlet I had at the time for being me. I'd realized I'm trans before this happened but it was still nice to put things aside for a time and just really be myself through this supposedly meaningless online character.  
Prior to all this very few of them knew much about my life out of the game and generally, they assumed I was a woman.  
I told them about how deeply hurt I am about something so seemingly meaningless and how the game itself is just a game but the stories we made together was among the only times I could feel like I was really me. I told them about how I'd been struggling with my identity during the time we played and how nice it was for me to just put my worries aside for a while and just not think about it. Give myself some time to rest.

Not a single person in that chat had anything but understanding and kind words to give. Many said that the game didn't mean nearly as mych to them as that, but that they could at least sympathize with me, if not understand.

(Background: I just recently came out as both Trans MtF, and Gay to my family, and so far, everyone who knows except for my Dad is super amazing and supportive.)

So, my Dad doesn't seem to be capable to fathom the idea of transgender. In his mind,

- Trans people just, ""decide"" to do it because some people randomly invented the concept of it a while back, and now that people can be more open about it, that people are doing it to either be ""trendy"" or do it out of ""peer pressure.""
- You are NOT born trans, gay, bi, or anything like that. That's also done to be trendy, because of peer pressure.
- Gay people are disgusting, and exist for no good reason.
- and if I'm attracted to girls, than why not just be a guy? It would be ""SO MUCH EASIER.""

It was by far the most idiodic, close minded shit I have ever heard come out of a human being.

686,2019-10-15 06:05:38,di3kfk,0,1,"Hi, I posted this elsewhere but I feel like its kind of getting buried there and at the moment and feeling pretty anxious about this and don't really have an outlet.  


I am posting here today as I am totally new to this and a bit confused and just not sure how things are going to proceed. Or even really how to go about this.

Without going into too much detail about my past and growing up. I am 29 years old, biologically male, recently have been coming more and more to terms with me not being very happy in my current body.

Growing up I was always kind of on the feminine side of things, while still also being very much a boy. But to this day pretty much all of my good friends are girls, and tbh I dont really bond or get close to guys on the same level. I have always been obsessed with cute things, I can remember butting heads with my mom as a kid over certain t-shirts and how no those are for girls, having certain toys that were most definitely meant for girls etc.

In my teens I started dressing more cute and effeminate while still staying strongly on the male side of things. Growing up I did have an attraction to female clothes, cross dressing etc but tbh I didnt really think much of it. As I became an adult I definitely starting having moments where I would see girls in public and be envious that I could not dress that way and be perceived as cute or wear cute clothes. Once at the bus loop I saw two tiny asian girls in matching pastel pink shortalls (tbh I love a lot of cute ""childish things, I have tons of stuffed animals etc in my house, also mad that this is way more acceptable for girls than guys) and being very envious. Me being a 6 foot 3 white guy, although very slim and all leg with very high hips I was sad I would never be adorable in that way.

Around age 19 I started to get into heroin, not long after I got into the skinhead scene (nothing to do with racism the punk rock music etc scene) I was shaving my head and comfortable looking masculine although definitely there was always the same undercurrent but it and some of my other issues and desires got pushed way down as I simple did not have the energy to deal with them.

On October 4th 2015, my 25th birthday I got clean off heroin. Not long after I started going back to wanting to be cute, feminine etc more than ever. Grew my hair back out etc. This kind of floundered a bit until the summer if 2018. I had been removing all my body hair for awhile, although ive never really liked it. I started wearing jean short shorts, shortalls etc with shaved legs in public, cute animal backpacks, while not really crossdressing definitely pushing the limits on what most people would consider acceptable male attire past the age of like 5 hahaha.

I made friends online, started kind of considering myself more of femboy. Whereas I dont really have an overwhelming desire to be perceived as female if I had the option I would change to a female body right now. I am very very very frustrated that I just turned 29 and feel like I am finally dressing and presenting myself the way I want to but feeling like I have very few years left of being happy with how I look. I thought I had a fear of getting older, which I kind of do, but a trans online friend of mine asked me if I had a fear of getting older or a fear of getting older and becoming more masculine as a man and it kind of got to me.

I know I want my body to be as feminine as possible. At the very least trying to hault me from becoming any more masculine. In a perfect world I would have a female body even though I dont really feel the overwhelming need to be categorized as female I dont really want to be male either. I get intense gratification when I see pictures of myself dressed feminine or flat our girly and being able to look cute but not necessarily having to full on pass. If I knew I would be happy with the end result I think I would want to go all the way, but one, I don't know if thats realistic, and two,I work as a mechanic in a very masculine work environment. I fear how becoming too obviously feminine could effect my career, not so much at this job, but if i ever did have to find another one in the field. I dont see myself being very successful. I dont know if this is making any sense, all I know at this point in time is I would like to do what I can to be moving in the direction of a more feminine body rather than male. I get a mental image of me in a few years trying to wear certain things and looking like my dad and it makes me want to cry. I saw a picture online of like a 50 something year old man in shortalls and it spend me spiraling into some serious self introspection as dumb and stupid as that sounds. I do not know where exactly I stand in terms of being trans, but I know I am not going to be happy if I get even 1% more masculine than I am now, but would be more happy if I woke up and found myself to look more feminine.

Last november I reached out to a place that seemed like almost a one stop shop for everything. I wanted HRT so bad and wanted to move forward. They emailed me back to let me know they no longer offered doctor services and every other avenue seemed to be way too overwhelming and confusing and I just couldn't handle it.

Recently at the urging of another friend I dug up the email and followed one of their recommendations of contacting transcarebc and getting a personal health navigator. They replied to me on friday and I am eagerly awaiting their response to put me in touch with a counsellor etc.

I was also hesitant because I felt that unless I basically told them I wanted to identify as female and go all the way hrt would not be an option. However a new friend I made a few days ago told me that no that is not true and it is possible for gender non conforming type people who want to look feminine to get hrt.

I feel like if I had been tackling this when I was 20 maybe I would say fuck it, Im transitioning. Now I feel like I would be more comfortable closer to the middle ground at least to start but im not sure if this is realistic. I also feel like if it comes down to it and my options are down to continue life as a man, or have to completely transition I feel like idk I would be more happy trying to live as a female than I would be aging and getting more masculine every day. I feel like I wasted so much time on heroin and that of all the things it took from me it may have put me a decade behind or even stopped me from becoming who I really want to be.

I am really not sure whats going to happen next, if there is things I should say, things I shouldnt say? Things I should do or see first? I have very supportive friends etc, I have zero interest in getting my family involved however. I am not very well versed in this scene, hrt, trans people etc. However I did make some friends online, and I made an alt facebook account so I dont have to maintain a 90 person block list every time I want to talk about these things and a lot of friends of those friends have added me and all seem super nice and cool. Also, judging by the amount of weird men from foreign countries trying to add me every day based on a picture where you cant see my face and I have no tits I must not be doing too bad of a job of looking cute!

&amp;#x200B;

and because I am proud so far of the change ive had in my looks since getting clean here are some kinda crappy pictures, im hoping that I will be able to be even happier with how I look soon!

I don‚Äôt know what to do, everything about the shots make me uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been doing this for 7 months now, and I messed a shot up once, my leg has been hurting nonstop for the past month, it‚Äôs a light tolerable pain but I absolutely can‚Äôt stand it anymore. I‚Äôm scared of messing up again and now I have insertion fear &amp; anxiety. 

I told my doctor about it and he told me it‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs just getting worse. Because of the 2 weeks (biweekly shots), more fear builds up progressively after each week passes and I focus too much on the shot dates, when I just want to live normally and not sob the days prior to my shot.

I feel so much better mentally, I‚Äôm so much happier, but no matter how much I tell myself all of this is worth it, I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT stand this process. I used to have 100% no fear of needles or ANYTHING, I did my shots by myself just fine, but over time this has made me develop a legitimate fear. My shot is today and I‚Äôve been sobbing for the past 3 hours.

My family members offered to do it for me but before they insert the needle I get aggressive and push them away and start freaking the hell out because I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre gonna mess up and I‚Äôm gonna bust another vein.

I‚Äôve pushed back my shots a total of an ENTIRE WEEK + 1 DAY because of how scared I am now, if I stuck with my shot days I would‚Äôve taken it last week on Monday.

780,2019-10-17 06:17:18,dj2a70,2,5,"So I'm finally ready to come out to a large group of my friends--namely, the trumpet section in my college marching band. There's about forty of us, and I've already got the message typed up and ready to copy/paste whenever I decide the time is right. I'm already out to two of them, and I trust almost all of them to be mature about it and to be encouraging and supportive and accepting once I come out to the rest. 

Here's the problem. I trust *almost* all of them. There are three people in the group who I really don't trust with this information. They're all more conservative-leaning. 

One is a straight-up white supremacist, so I imagine his views on LGBTQ+ issues are about as primitive as his views on race.

One is a regular old conservative Trump apologist, though he insists he doesn't like Trump. He's told me to my face (not knowing I'm trans, of course) that he thinks gender non-conformity is a mental illness and trans people need mental help instead of being allowed to transition.

And one is my roommate and one of my best friends, but has told me before he supports Trump. He makes a lot of gay/trans jokes, and I really worry that when he eventually finds out it will complicate things for a number of reasons. For one, we live together. He's sleeping in a bed about fifteen feet away from me as I type this. If he doesn't accept me, and isn't comfortable with sharing a room with a girl (even though I'm still very much only attracted to girls), not only will things become incredibly awkward between us, but I don't know if he'll look into switching into another dorm, or making me switch into another dorm. This is a bit of an extreme, worst-case scenario, but I still worry. 

Should I let three people likely not accepting me stop me from coming out to the other 35ish people who I anticipate to either support me or just not care (which, frankly, is better than actively despising me)?

Hello my name is Victoria. I'm a 24 year old Trans woman. I need some advice from members of the community that have come out to to people and had less then positive reaction from people. 

I'm currently in the process of coming out of the closet completely. My friends know and most my family knows. There are a few holdouts because I know they will not take it well at all. 2 of these holdouts are my grandparents that only come to town once or twice a year but always for Christmas. I was planning on telling them after the Christmas festivities were done this year. I feel like this is the only time I can tell them face to face before I'm to far along on hormones which I start mid November. 

My question is should I wait and tell them over the phone which my mother is suggesting or should I go with my plans and tell them at Christmas time. Any advice would be helpful I'm sorry for such a long post. I tried to shorten as much as I could to get to the root of the problem.",trans,Looking for Advice.,1571335847.0,"{'created_utc': 1571310647, 'id': 'dj4uzw', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ""\nHello my name is Victoria.

789,2019-10-17 14:17:22,dj70i8,3,3,"Hello! This is literally my first post on Reddit ever, so I hope I'm in the right place. Apologies if I'm doing it wrong! 

I'm looking for advice on how to give my sister the best support and encouragement that I can.  I should also add that most of my trans terminology is dated, because I looked up most of this stuff when I was like, sneaking my then-girlfriend my birth control as a teenager and boy howdy all of this stuff has changed! I'm a den mother to a bunch of trans kids in my city now and I've picked up a lot from them but I know that the terminology is important and I want to get it right.

For background:

My sister (35) has been on HRT for a few years now, but she  still dresses in masc clothing, doesn't wear makeup, etc.  She's pretty much a homebody and hasn't been working for a long time, but she has a few IRL friends that she is comfortable around and who are supportive of her. (She and I live in different countries, so I can't give all that much IRL support.) My family knows that she's trans, and they claim to be supportive, but nobody has seen her for a few years because we're all pretty far-flung. 

We're all meeting up for a big family reunion at my brother's (47 cis M) house. It's around my nephew's third birthday, so there will be lots of little kids around and their parents, who may not share anything in common with my brother's family other than ""has a child of approximately 3 years of age.""  My brother seems accepting of our sister, but he's also pretty traditionally heterosexual and macho, and he lives in an part of the country that is full of rich Republicans.

Anyway, my sister is going to be dressing femme for the first time around my family, and I can tell she's really nervous about it. One of the problems is that she's big and tall, and she doesn't ""pass"" very well. (I know that ""passing"" is bullshit, and fuck being ""one of the good ones,"" but it's going to affect how much static she gets.)  My sister is also one of the most sensitive people I have ever met, and it's one of the things I love about her the most, but it means that any transphobia hits her really hard. 

Anyway. 

I want to know how I can support her the most in this time. I've asked her how I can help, and given her the ""I got your back"" speech, and said, [if it sucks, we can leave](https://twitter.com/dasharez0ne/status/1125839557352742913?lang=en)! I also can do makeup and can bring a wig and all that.  

Is there stuff that she might not think to ask for? Is there more I can do?  I just want to do the best for my sister. I know I can't protect her from all of the bullshit she's gonna get but I want to be able to be as proactive as possible.

I have several trans friends. And all of them basically do the same thing.

When we meet new people or go to new places the conversation always ends up at their trans and that they used to be a different gender. it's almost like they are advertising to people that their trans and their introductions.

if trends people want to transition to a different gender why do they always remind everyone that they used to be a different gender? why not just tell people that they're a boy if they used to be a girl but never mention the fact that they used to be a girl.

A lot of my transfriends get very very upset when they get misgendered. yeti don't mind telling everyone that they used to be a different gender and show pictures.

I'm sorry, but I just don't understand. If you want to be a boy why not just declare yourself a boy. Why do you have to bring up the fact that they used to be a girl?

So before we get into all hahaha the stuff below here, a bit about me! I'm 35, work as a writer in a big city and am somehow perplexed that I made it work out. I came out about 13 years ago and started HRT around 2007/2008, going full time shortly after 2009 and, for various reasons I'd rather not get into, went stealth a few years after that. Had my surgery (Class of Brassard '12), and have mostly been living my life contending with some serious depression and CPTSD that has, haha, been such a god damned delight. 

ANYWAYS. After something like nine years or so living stealth, I'm starting to reevaluate my feelings on that. Admittedly it's really...painful to hear a lot of discussion about trans issues happening all over the world and being unable to speak up too much about them out of fear of outing myself and being unable to bring my own personal experience into things (because haha I went stealth for a number of reasons, safety being one of them). No shade to anyone who chooses to go stealth, but personally at this point I'm starting to feel the constraints I put on myself and I'm...regretting it.

I also really freaking miss the sense of community. The sense of belonging I had with my trans brothers and sisters. Thanks to a fun mix of depression and the industry I work in, most people I know IRL are cis and...that's not fantastic.

Anyways, I don't know where this is going, but I just thought that something I'd like to do is...well...reconnect with more supportive trans people so I don't feel so alone. I've been a lurker on a few subreddits here, but I guess this is my ""long time listener, first time caller"" moment. It's scary, I'm worrying that I'm a bit too old to be in these spaces anymore, or if I'm even welcome. But here we are.

901,2019-10-20 02:31:31,dkdoip,1,4,"(content warning: I talk about dysphoria , issues with being percieved as female by others and ""passing"", and other bad feels which may be all too relatable, read at your own risk)   


A bit of life story for context. I transitioned in my teens. My transition was kind of a gradual thing, at 13 I started growing my hair out, at 14 I started to straighten my now shoulder-length hair (I will never forget the euphoria I felt when I straightened my hair for the first time), started wearing make-up shortly before turning 15. For a while, I was presenting female, long hair, make-up, etc. but I identified as an androgyne/ gender non conforming male. At 16 is when I did the whole name and pronoun change process, and at 17 I started spiro and estrogen at 19 (I bitterly regret that gap- I really wish I was self-aware about being trans much earlier)  


My biggest regret is that my body went through the changes of endogenous testosterone and not being aware of the more physical aspects of my dysphoria until it was too late. Initially, the euphoria of having long hair and being able to express my feminine side with make-up kind of blindsided the physical aspects of my dysphoria, but as time went on and testosterone did more damage, I found that hair/makeup/clothes were no longer sufficient to make me look like a girl, and that the ""guy underneath"" started showing through even with all the feminine presentation, so that is when the physical dysphoria and awareness that I am trans and not gender non conforming hit me like a brick. I also hated the effect high testosterone levels had on my libido, it felt so evil and completely alien to me and was actually traumatizing. It felt like I was being violated by my own body. I am still traumatized by that.   


Now-a-days, I have been on estrogen for 7 years and a few months. HRT has been the only part of my physical transition, since I cannot afford things like surgery or electrolysis.   


I got off very lucky in the sense that my skeletal frame below the neck was pretty much immune to the effects of testosterone- although I am tall for a woman at 5'9"", I have a very proportionately small frame and have very narrow wrists, ribcage, small hands/feet, narrow shoulders, etc. I know many cis women who are like 5'2"" who wear an equal/larger shoe size than me, have thicker wrists, ribcage, wider shoulders, etc. so I am very fortunate in that sense. My breasts/hips are pretty small, but thanks to my small frame, they really stand out.    


Unfortunately, I didn't fare so well above the neck, and have a fairly prominent Adam's apple, facial hair, large forehead with an ""M"" shaped hairline, large nose with a hump, long midface, etc. I at least have good eyes and cheekbones, which help a lot when I put make-up on. My voice used to be extremely deep, has improved a lot with training, but still has more husky undertones than I would like, especially when I am sad/tired and have a ""frog in my throat"".   


This puts me in a situation where people perceive me incredibly differently depending on my presentation (and mood, because that affects my voice resonance a lot- I sound more masculine if I'm in a bad mood due to the ""frog in my throat"", which often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy if I am clocked).   


If I am wearing full make-up, hair done to hide the ""bad"" facial features, have a good skin day for shaving with minimal razor burn, make sure to keep my head tilted at an angle where my Adam's apples is less visible, am in a good mood and am easily able to speak in a bright voice with no husky resonance, etc. I am percieved as a cisgender woman, and even sometimes an \*attractive\* cisgender woman. I have become pretty good at make-up over the years, and I have figured out how to do my make-up in a way where I am able to make my ""good"" features (eyes and cheekbones) look very prominent while using contouring and highlighting to make my face appear softer and more feminine, so I can make myself legit look pretty good if all the conditions are right. As long as I take 2 hours to get ready in the morning and remain in a happy mood, I am nearly unclockable.  However, all it takes to ruin this is something as simple as talking once negative emotions put a ""frog"" in my throat and fucking up my voice, or staying at someone's house overnight, or inclement weather- the transformation for the worse from just one night of sleep or a windy/rainy day is immense.   


By morning, my hair becomes thin, greasy, and stringy after just one night without washing it. It no longer frames my face well, and my masculine facial features become prominent. By the morning, even if I may not have a 5 o'clock shadow per se, my face begins to feel like sandpaper and it just starts looking ""off"" even though my facial stubble is blonde. I've had times where people would touch the lower half of my face at times like this and completely lose my shit. Even if I keep my make-up on overnight (which I like to avoid since it's bad for the skin), I no longer have baby soft/smooth skin due to the facial hair coming in which ruins everything no matter how intact my make-up is. No matter how well I was passing the night before, those things usually clock me by morning.   


All this makes everything \*still\* feel like this performance, or disguise, that I am putting on. Even if I may have become exceptionally \*good at it\* to the point that people initially think I am an attractive cisgender woman, the fact that it can all be taken away if I wash my face and buzz my hair short makes it feel all so inauthentic. It really messes with my head.   


I am very well integrated socially, everyone that knows me thinks of me as nothing but female. But knowing what the ""real me"" still looks like underneath all the hair and make-up, I still feel like this is some kind of disguise or performance. It made sense during the early parts of my transition for me to feel like I was ""pretending"", since it was still new and everyone was getting used to it, but for that feeling to persist now after all these years and with social acceptance is really disappointing to me. I hate that I still feel like this. **I feel like being a woman is still something that I \*want to be\*, rather than something that I actually \*am\*.**   


It really sucks because the pressure to meet those cisnormative, feminine beauty standards is almost making me feel like being female is becoming this inauthentic goal that I cannot achieve. This really sucks because in the past, being male was this inauthentic thing that I could never correctly play the role of, yet as a female, I don't feel authentic for different reasons. As a male, my personality betrayed me, but as a female, my body betrays me.

I transitioned in my teens. My transition was kind of a gradual thing, at 13 I started growing my hair out, at 14 I started to straighten my now shoulder-length hair (I will never forget the euphoria I felt when I straightened my hair for the first time), started wearing make-up shortly before turning 15. For a while, I was presenting female, long hair, make-up, etc. but I identified as an androgyne/ gender non conforming male. At 16 is when I did the whole name and pronoun change process, and at 17 I started spiro and estrogen at 19 (I bitterly regret that gap- I really wish I was self-aware about being trans much earlier)  \n\n\nMy biggest regret is that my body went through the changes of endogenous testosterone and not being aware of the more physical aspects of my dysphoria until it was too late. Initially, the euphoria of having long hair and being able to express my feminine side with make-up kind of blindsided the physical aspects of my dysphoria, but as time went on and testosterone did more damage, I found that hair/makeup/clothes were no longer sufficient to make me look like a girl, and that the ""guy underneath"" started showing through even with all the feminine presentation, so that is when the physical dysphoria and awareness that I am trans and not gender non conforming hit me like a brick. I also hated the effect high testosterone levels had on my libido, it felt so evil and completely alien to me and was actually traumatizing. It felt like I was being violated by my own body. I am still traumatized by that.   \n\n\nNow-a-days, I have been on estrogen for 7 years and a few months. HRT has been the only part of my physical transition, since I cannot afford things like surgery or electrolysis.   \n\n\nI got off very lucky in the sense that my skeletal frame below the neck was pretty much immune to the effects of testosterone- although I am tall for a woman at 5\'9"", I have a very proportionately small frame and have very narrow wrists, ribcage, small hands/feet, narrow shoulders, etc. I know many cis women who are like 5\'2"" who wear an equal/larger shoe size than me, have thicker wrists, ribcage, wider shoulders, etc. so I am very fortunate in that sense. My breasts/hips are pretty small, but thanks to my small frame, they really stand out.    \n\n\nUnfortunately, I didn\'t fare so well above the neck, and have a fairly prominent Adam\'s apple, facial hair, large forehead with an ""M"" shaped hairline, large nose with a hump, long midface, etc. I at least have good eyes and cheekbones, which help a lot when I put make-up on. My voice used to be extremely deep, has improved a lot with training, but still has more husky undertones than I would like, especially when I am sad/tired and have a ""frog in my throat"".   \n\n\nThis puts me in a situation where people perceive me incredibly differently depending on my presentation (and mood, because that affects my voice resonance a lot- I sound more masculine if I\'m in a bad mood due to the ""frog in my throat"", which often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy if I am clocked).   \n\n\nIf I am wearing full make-up, hair done to hide the ""bad"" facial features, have a good skin day for shaving with minimal razor burn, make sure to keep my head tilted at an angle where my Adam\'s apples is less visible, am in a good mood and am easily able to speak in a bright voice with no husky resonance, etc. I am percieved as a cisgender woman, and even sometimes an \\*attractive\\* cisgender woman. I have become pretty good at make-up over the years, and I have figured out how to do my make-up in a way where I am able to make my ""good"" features (eyes and cheekbones) look very prominent while using contouring and highlighting to make my face appear softer and more feminine, so I can make myself legit look pretty good if all the conditions are right. As long as I take 2 hours to get ready in the morning and remain in a happy mood, I am nearly unclockable.  However, all it takes to ruin this is something as simple as talking once negative emotions put a ""frog"" in my throat and fucking up my voice, or staying at someone\'s house overnight, or inclement weather- the transformation for the worse from just one night of sleep or a windy/rainy day is immense.   \n\n\nBy morning, my hair becomes thin, greasy, and stringy after just one night without washing it. It no longer frames my face well, and my masculine facial features become prominent. By the morning, even if I may not have a 5 o\'clock shadow per se, my face begins to feel like sandpaper and it just starts looking ""off"" even though my facial stubble is blonde. I\'ve had times where people would touch the lower half of my face at times like this and completely lose my shit. Even if I keep my make-up on overnight (which I like to avoid since it\'s bad for the skin), I no longer have baby soft/smooth skin due to the facial hair coming in which ruins everything no matter how intact my make-up is. No matter how well I was passing the night before, those things usually clock me by morning.   \n\n\nAll this makes everything \\*still\\* feel like this performance, or disguise, that I am putting on. Even if I may have become exceptionally \\*good at it\\* to the point that people initially think I am an attractive cisgender woman, the fact that it can all be taken away if I wash my face and buzz my hair short makes it feel all so inauthentic. It really messes with my head.   \n\n\nI am very well integrated socially, everyone that knows me thinks of me as nothing but female. But knowing what the ""real me"" still looks like underneath all the hair and make-up, I still feel like this is some kind of disguise or performance. It made sense during the early parts of my transition for me to feel like I was ""pretending"", since it was still new and everyone was getting used to it, but for that feeling to persist now after all these years and with social acceptance is really disappointing to me. I hate that I still feel like this. **I feel like being a woman is still something that I \\*want to be\\*, rather than something that I actually \\*am\\*.**   \n\n\nIt really sucks because the pressure to meet those cisnormative, feminine beauty standards is almost making me feel like being female is becoming this inauthentic goal that I cannot achieve. This really sucks because in the past, being male was this inauthentic thing that I could never correctly play the role of, yet as a female, I don\'t feel authentic for different reasons. As a male, my personality betrayed me, but as a female, my body betrays me.   \n\n\nI have thought about whether maybe I am non-binary and perhaps the reason this all feels so inauthentic is maybe because I should embrace some of the more androgynous or ""in-between"" aspects of myself and not feel so pressured to meet this standard of femininity that I put on myself.

Also, I apologize if anything I say offends anyone. This is not intended to offend you or be malicious in any way. This is just how I feel. (Context: I am 18 years old, biologically female.)

Ever since I learned about the existence of trans people (Caitlyn Jenner coming out when I was in middle school) I have been struggling to block out thoughts of identifying as trans myself. I have done extensive research on it for years in an attempt to prove to myself that I am definitely not trans, and that I don't have to identify as anything other than my birth gender to be happy. That I can just accept that I am a more masculine female and be happy. But I know that the truth is -- and has been for as long as I have been alive and capable of introspective thought -- if I could, I would 100% choose to wake up tomorrow as the opposite sex.

I have always had an unexplainable desire to wear baggy clothes to hide my breasts (even before I knew about transgender identities) and present as masculine as possible in both looks and actions. This has always been specifically because I subconsciously want people to think that I am boyish -- I don't know where this desire comes from. I have also always, with absolutely no exceptions no matter how hard I tried, preferred to play male characters since I played pretend with my stuffed animals as a preschooler to acting in school musicals as a teenager; I would be extremely uncomfortable playing a feminine character. If I understood why I did these things I would change it in a heartbeat. I struggle with these weird desires and more related ones every day.

But the thought of identifying as transgender scares me more than anything ever has. For one thing, I worry that I am perhaps getting swept up in a social trend. (In the context of a social trend, it is one that I personally find a little overwhelming, and I would probably be uncomfortable with being associated with.) I don't know what I would do if I ended up regretting this later. I also am unsure about my sexuality and worry about the possibility of being a trans man who is also attracted to men. Personally, I don't see anything wrong with that in itself. But the thought of disappointing my parents and family and friends with what could be described as a one-two punch makes me nauseous. And if I transitioned, that means that I would not be able to get with straight males, who are the only people I have ever considered dating. (Yet both of my relationships have ended due to my being uncomfortable, for most likely gender-related reasons that I have tried not to think about.)

The other thought I have is this: if I am being told that I should unapologetically be myself and love myself for who I am, shouldn't I not transition? Shouldn't I just accept that I am not a typically feminine girl and own it and not change anything, rather than transition? This seems logical to me -- yet the subconscious yearning to be seen as male as possible makes this very difficult to carry out.

I have no access to a gender therapist, but even if I did I'm not sure I would go. I am extremely ashamed about the fact that I probably should go see one in the first place.

So... can anyone relate to any of this, or can give me any advice? I've been stuck in this same cycle of thought for about 6 years and I don't know what to do to stop it, but I need it to stop. I can't take it anymore.

A bit of background first. (Im 17 mtf btw)

I changed to a different doctor a month ago because I moved into a different town and wanted something closer.  (before it was a 2 hour trip)  So they were doing their routine tests, and drew my blood.  They also wanted to check my private area, but we all know that's a big nono, so I refused.  My mom griped at me for it, but I didn't care. 

About a week later the blood results got back.  My doctor claimed my estrogen was way too high even for a female.  But I'm very skeptical of that, since not only do I not notice anything to back that up, but it was very obvious I was trans.  The doctor referred my to an endocrinologist and a month later here I am.

Now to today.

I woke up around 9am  having only slept 6 hours the night before.  I got ready and left around 11am.

The place was very far away, and took over two hours to get to (I live in the middle of nowhere).  But also, my mom got lost more times than I can count, and we got there an hour late.  But they managed to get me in despite that.

So they did the whole questions, height, and weight, and got me with the doctor.

He had a really heavy Indian accent, which I like, and explained a lot of things about hormones that I didnt understand.  He said they would have to do a lot of tests, which I didn't like.

They insisted I have my genitailia inspected, bt again I refused.  I was never informed about this beforehand, and I dont take surprises well, even if good...  They kept on, and my mom kept trying to convince me, but I couldn't.  I hope you all understand, since I think it's common for transpeople to be sensitive about that?  I also have *severe* anxiety issues where just being around others is painful.

About 10 minutes later, and I start crying, unable to convince my mom in my favor.  Of course I should have, and I knew that, but I couldn't do it.  It was humiliating and dehumanizing just to think about it.  

The doctor was really nice, which made me feel bad about refusing, and made sure to inform me he was pro-trans (which is rare af in my country).  Meanwhile my mom was griping me out nonstop.

After a point I just broke.  I went off into my own fantasy land, staring into the corner and blanking out for what may have been hours.  I ignored everything everyone said and did.  Every so often I'd come to, reposition myself a bit, and go right back into my self-imposed solitude.

I did hear at some point that my doctor had lied about having such high estrogen.  The endocrinologist looked over a copy of the blood work and said it was barely abnormal.

Eventually they gave up, and I feel really bad about wasting their time and energy especially since they were so nice.  He just did other tests, like feeling my neck, which I just ignored.  They also did an xray if my hand for some reason and drew blood.  After that I could go.

But I felt horrible after.  Not only do I feel like a piece of shit and a waste of time and resources, and an ungreatful bitch, but I also wasted my whole day for that.  Maybe the blood work they did will do something good, but I'm just fucking screwed.

Since then I've invested in more fem outfits, worked on makeup, my voice, and pursued hrt and other surgeries. 

I've been out to almost everyone at least everyone excluding my family. Basically I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that my parents will disown me and my life could be at risk at that point. My culture is extremely homophobic and even more so transphobic. 

My father would rather kill me than allow me to transition. I've never had a good relationship with my parents but when my mom came back from being abroad, we got closer. I had crashed her car over the summer and got really hurt. 

During that time I made it my job to get her money from insurance and I did but when she came back we found out that someone had stolen her identity using tax documents from the car. The doors were broken and someone rifled through but we only found out when she cameback stateside and by then it was too late. 

After all the shit I put her through, she told me that no matter what happened no matter what she lost and no matter how depressed she feels, she said that she's grateful to god that she didn't comeback to my body. I couldn't hate anything about her at all, that was the most loving thing I've ever gotten from everyone.

I truly miss my sisters and I miss my mother and I even miss my father. Since then I've done my best to help my mom get her identity and money back, we both paid bills together and took care of each other to rebuild our lives. I've been wanting to get braids for my hair to make me feel less dysphoric but my friends advised me against that because I can't hide braids from my mom and that might lead to issues with our relationship. 

My mom said she would be leaving in January and my friends told me to wait until then but that only makes me sadder. All that means is that one day I will no longer be able to hide myself and I will lose my connection to my family. It hurts the most that I felt so loved near the end. 

I want to toughen my heart and be cold and not care but that's not who I am. The person I was before transition was cold hearted and unhappy, I don't want to be that. What's the point of transitioning if it isn't to be happier, to live a life that is a reflection of who you are. To be loved for who you are. I want to believe that my mom and everyone will still love me but I've grown more doubtful as I see how people in my culture treat me. 

I just want to know why my happiness has to mess up everyone else's happiness? I want to know why I can't have something as simple as hair? Why can't I have what I need to be alive? Why can't I get the space I need to breathe, to even move?

I want to believe that my mom and everyone will still love me but I've grown more doubtful as I see how people in my culture treat me. \n\nI just want to know why my happiness has to mess up everyone else's happiness? I want to know why I can't have something as simple as hair? Why can't I have what I need to be alive? Why can't I get the space I need to breathe, to even move? I just feel like I'm drowning in a sea of endless suffering unable to see a single light and the one light I found, the one thing that kept me going is being crushed by strangers, friends, and even my family for cruel reasons."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""I'm having issues transitioning"", 'created': 1571830392.0}"

1064,2019-10-23 07:11:11,dlvm7c,6,3,"Hey everyone!

I am a straight, cis, white male. I consider myself an ally, but am recognizing more and more that I don't know much at all about trans issues. This is actually true of a lot of leftist issues, but as someone who is living paycheck to paycheck, I at least have a very base-level grasp of those issues, unlike trans issues which I'm largely ignorant of outside of surface level familiarity that I've managed to gain from my internet habits.

So onto my actual questions. I saw Lindsay Ellis post a thing on Twitter defending Natalie Wynn (of Contrapoints), saying that she didn't always agree with Natalie's views or actions, but that she was her friend, and she wouldn't be bullied into disavowing her.

At first glance, this seems reasonable to me, and actually kind of resonates with me; I struggle with how divisive and self-cannibalistic leftist communities can be sometimes (but not always!) so Lindsay's message of holding someone to account but not casting them out in total spoke to me.

But I also recognize that a lot of the people upset are trans, and knowing that I'm not well-versed in trans issues, I figured I should make an effort to understand. Here's what I do know:

-Natalie is a trans youtuber who speaks to a lot of leftist issues on her channel. My understanding is that she's not always the favorite of the trans community due to various comments she's made. But I don't know much about it.

-She recently featured Buck Angel on her show. He's a trans porn star, but apparently is something called a ""transmedicalist"" or something but I don't know what that means. I'll be googling it after I post this. This guest appearance pissed off the trans community again, I'm guessing because of whatever TM is.

This is sincere information seeking. I fully acknowledge my lack of understanding, but I really do WANT to be a good ally, and I do want to know what all this means, more or less.

Cis men don't have people staring at them all the time in public places. Cis men don't have to constantly explain and justify their identity to people. Most cis men can go to almost any part of the world, no matter how bigoted or backwards it is and walk around around unnoticed, and feel safe. 

By being trans and expressing my identity, I'm losing my ability to blend in. I don't pass very well, and maybe I never will. If I want to avoid constantly being the elephant in the room and feeling unsafe, I'm limited to only going to certain communities, mostly in cities, where I know that trans/queer people are regular sights and I won't feel like some kind of oddity to people. The world feels so much smaller to me now, and it makes me feel like I'm losing something by transitioning into my authentic self.

Once I was done explaining, she told me that it was the hormones' fault. Like, she didn't even checked me or asked if I had an ultrasound, a tomography  or a blood test (which I had because I was hospitalized because of the abdominal pain). I told her that there was no way that was possible because I spoke with my endocrinologyst and he told me - TL;DR - hormones have nothing to do with what I am feeling, and all my organs are perfectly fine, so I shouldn't worry.

She gave me a special diet called ""FODMAP"" for 15 days, and told me to take ezomepasol before breakfast.

One week later, I visited her again, told her that I have beem strictly following her instructions, but still felt sick.and after she felt my abdomen, she told me AGAIN that it was the hormones' fault and told me to go see a therapist.

Okay, so I stayed calm and told her again it has nothing to do with the hormones. So she told me I had to do a feces exam and an endoscopy.(I had to stop taking hormones for three days and let me add, I felt as bad as always.)

Today, I went so they could do the endoscopy. Once the exam was done and I woke up from the sedation, the doctor told me that I was fine, that the organs were fine and that I had to wait for the results for the H. Pilori. 
And guess what? she said that it was most likely the HORMONES' FAULT AGAIN. AND THAT I SHOULD GO SEE A THERAPIST.

Specifically, the trans masc community (I can't speak for what goes on in trans femme groups).  There is so much judgement and hyper criticism of how other trans masc people go about their transition, how masculine or not they choose to present, their choice to birth or not birth children.  It gets pretty old.  

If you join a group for binary trans men or straight trans men it's almost a guarantee that the group will be 95% insecure guys fairly early on in their journey shitting on the choices of other trans masc people.  They will claim that these ""not really trans"" or ""not adequately trans"" trans people are the reason cis people hate us, or are the reason for gate-keeping, or whatever new bullshit they've come up with to hate on other trans people.  I always want to ask them:  ""Do you want trans care to go back to what it was until about a decade or so ago, when you had to be the most hetero, the most masculine, your mannerisms, voice patterns had to be perfect or you didn't ""want it enough""? Some of you likely wouldn't meet that criteria.  Is it about legitimizing yourself to cis people? If they don't understand trans people they aren't gonna understand you unless you have a specific narrow narrative that not even all binary trans people have. Do you think it's gonna make you money or get you famous? ...LOL Do you believe that people should get an opinion on YOUR identity? No? So why do you think that you should get an opinion on other people's identities?""

Maybe it's because I've been around the community for nearly 15 years, 10 of that in transition but it's old and tiring.  I'll be honest, I used to be like that, I tried to police people, I was a bully, I was an asshole, and being that person I was being, a lot of the self hatred I had, it wasn't able to escape, because I was living a life of hatred. I couldn't heal myself because I was too worried about what everyone else was doing. Once I learned to let go that belief, realize that other people living their lives fully and happily wasn't impacting me, and moved away from the toxic communities I was in, where we were all feeding on each other's hatred, I became a different person. Lateral aggression in marginalized communities is a real issue. We spend so much time being shit on by the majority that we feel like the rest of the community aren't doing their part, they aren't playing the game of being an X minority right, ""if trans people would just x, y, z then cis people wouldn't be so shitty to us."" That's not true, see my earlier point. There are always going to be people that dislike us because we are trans and they feel it's abnormal/unnatural/sin/fake/etc. You have to learn that other people are going to do what they do regardless of what you think, so holding onto negative feelings towards other trans people because they don't meet your expectations isn't healthy and is actually damaging to you, not only due to the physical effects of stress and anger, but socially as well.

Anyway as of lately things have not been the best. We can‚Äôt talk without having a serious conversation. I like to call it arguing because he‚Äôs not listening and I‚Äôm forcing an explanation to somethings I shouldn‚Äôt have too. He is still a virgin and I‚Äôm not. I talked about waiting to have sex until he completely transitioned. Not because of me not being comfortable with him having a vagina (which I am) but because he thinks sex will keep me in a relationship. To me he doesn‚Äôt sound ready at all or comfortable with himself. Saying he wants to stay fully clothed and not allowing me to touch him. When I brought the suggestion up he completely went into a ‚Äúwhy are you with me‚Äù conversation. Saying things like ‚Äúif you know I‚Äôll never be good enough why be with me?‚Äù. Or when I try to explain what I mean he begins to get sarcastic saying things like ‚Äúcongratulations you were born with the parts your comfortable with.‚Äù Or ‚Äúyour sooooo lucky to be who you feel you are.‚Äù 

I completely support my boyfriends decisions with everything he does. Not once have I intentionally or ever tried to make him feel less than a man. I don‚Äôt see him as anything else. When I mentioned to him that I was just getting tired of the back and forth and just needed to maybe take a break he said it‚Äôs his‚Äùdysphoria‚Äù. When he says things or does things that are d***ish he blames it all on his dysphoria. He tells me to treat him like a normal guy and I try but to be honest any normal guy would have already gotten a we‚Äôre over text. 

I really love my boyfriend. (Yes even though we haven‚Äôt physically met) I just think that maybe he doesn‚Äôt understand how draining it is to deal with smart remarks or argumentative comments. Even when I tell him I love him he asks me ‚Äúam I sure‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you really love me‚Äù. I tell him and show him as much as I can that I do and I don‚Äôt mind repeating myself but 6 times in a 2 minute conversation is a bit much. He likes to say it‚Äôs ‚Äúreassurance‚Äù. I‚Äôm already stressed between work and school and he is my only safe place to relax and just enjoy my time but it‚Äôs starting to become just another dreadful task. Im not sure if this is normal or if maybe I should try and take a break in our relationship or what. One thing I do know is that it‚Äôs pushing me away.

Or when I try to explain what I mean he begins to get sarcastic saying things like ‚Äúcongratulations you were born with the parts your comfortable with.‚Äù Or ‚Äúyour sooooo lucky to be who you feel you are.‚Äù \n\nI completely support my boyfriends decisions with everything he does. Not once have I intentionally or ever tried to make him feel less than a man. I don‚Äôt see him as anything else. When I mentioned to him that I was just getting tired of the back and forth and just needed to maybe take a break he said it‚Äôs his‚Äùdysphoria‚Äù. When he says things or does things that are d***ish he blames it all on his dysphoria. He tells me to treat him like a normal guy and I try but to be honest any normal guy would have already gotten a we‚Äôre over text. \n\nI really love my boyfriend. (Yes even though we haven‚Äôt physically met) I just think that maybe he doesn‚Äôt understand how draining it is to deal with smart remarks or argumentative comments. Even when I tell him I love him he asks me ‚Äúam I sure‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you really love me‚Äù. I tell him and show him as much as I can that I do and I don‚Äôt mind repeating myself but 6 times in a 2 minute conversation is a bit much. He likes to say it‚Äôs ‚Äúreassurance‚Äù. I‚Äôm already stressed between work and school and he is my only safe place to relax and just enjoy my time but it‚Äôs starting to become just another dreadful task. Im not sure if this is normal or if maybe I should try and take a break in our relationship or what. One thing I do know is that it‚Äôs pushing me away. I told him but I‚Äôm not sure he understands to what extent. My heart hurts at the thought of losing him but I cannot mentally take being so drained.

1182,2019-10-25 06:55:00,dmtmq4,0,1,"Tonight has been a rollercoaster of a ride. Hold on while I give you the long story.

When I was a little kid, I grew my hair out long and pretended to be a girl. I liked it better and felt like people were nicer to me. I exclusively hung out with girls, and was always labeled as too ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù or ‚Äúpassive‚Äù. I can‚Äôt tell you how many discussions I had in elementary school with my parents that ended in ‚Äúman up‚Äù or ‚Äústop being so sensitive‚Äù. 

I kept my hair long through middle school, but was bullied pretty badly. Went I entered into high school I still looked very androgynous and people mistook me for a girl all the time.

Everything changed my sophomore year. I ended up with some very masculine friends I found playing sports, and ended up with a girlfriend. I cut my hair very short and started dressing with flannels and jeans and typical menswear. At this time I felt like I needed to adopt a sexist attitude towards women to ‚Äúfit‚Äù the male mold. I‚Äôm not proud of that at all, but toxic masculinity really pushed me into that space. I ended up very depressed. I became suicidal senior year. I had to get a circumcision at 17 for medical reasons and I remember wishing that they could have taken the whole thing.

Then I moved out of my conservative hometown. I started spending time with people who weren‚Äôt crushed into gender roles and really didn‚Äôt seem to ‚Äúcare‚Äù about their gender... they just lived. I remember cross dressing there at parties a few times and feeling so free about it. I realized at this point that I was bisexual. My body dysmorphia continued at this point and I felt uncomfortable with having male genitalia. The (as I just learned) famous ‚Äúbutton‚Äù question  would be a daily occurrence. 

Tonight I was browsing the internet as one does and stumbled across r/egg_irl. I guess some of the posts really resonated (I know, this is ironic, it‚Äôs a meme subreddit) with me and I started questioning.

Questioning everything.

And I realized: all these years, ever since I was a little kid I haven‚Äôt fit into this male model. Biologically speaking I don‚Äôt feel like I have body dysmorphia to the degree many individuals in the trans community do, but I certainly wish my gender was physically different. And I most certainly have never fit into what is socially or psychosexually male. 

A huge lightbulb has gone off in my head. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm trans or just gender curious, but I do know that I am going to go out tomorrow and buy a beautiful dress (I‚Äôve always loved the idea of dresses) and wear it around the house. I‚Äôm gonna try makeup. I‚Äôm gonna give myself a damn close shave. I‚Äôm going to walk around like I always do and not care about the ‚Äúfeminine gait‚Äù comments I always get. 

This is so exciting, and scary at the same time. This is one of the first nights I‚Äôm going to fall asleep NOT in a depressive mess and I‚Äôm so glad for it.

Hopefully I can talk to my psychologist about this revelation soon. I want to make sure this is about body positivity and not the sexual shame I‚Äôve experienced in my past. 

I am very confused but also very happy and I thought I would share. Have any of you had similar ‚Äúepiphany‚Äù moments like this?

There were certainly many clues that some of the characters may be transgendered; and many subtle sex jokes.  There are many allusions throughout the first episode to voyeurism, from the little body staring through the hole in the wood (""wood""), to the numerous references to ""watching"" (""who watches the watchers?  we watch."" or ""WATCH this boy"", ""WATCHmen""), fisting jokes (""give me five"" etc), etc.

The only character I can say pretty definitively is trans would be Sister Night.  She more or less openly states so in the classroom with allusions to bottom surgery, (""The doctors had to pull me apart to get out the ""bullet"").  This has necessitated adoption, which is why, unlike her and her husband, the kids are not African American.  Note the squid poster in the background during this scene.  Also note the discussion of ""eggs""; quite apart from egg white representing semen, pretrans women often refer to themselves as ""eggs"", because once they hatch they become ""chicks"".  She works in a ""bakery"", which is a place where there is a ""bun in the oven"".  She carries rosary beads, but they are obviously refashioned anal beads.  During the scene in which numerous cows are shot, keep in mind that cows produce milk; these symbolize the destruction of her reproductive capacity.  She refers to her nose for ""white"" supremacy, which smells like ""bleach"", although she certainly won't be producing any without her ""bullet"".

&amp;#x200B;

I also consider the possibility that the sheriff is a trans man.  There are numerous subtle behavioral cues, but I like most of all the fact that he is the only police officer to not wear a mask.  Since he has taken his off (""come out""), he refuses to ever wear one again.  He has become a ""hung"" man.  Where he tells his officer to pull down the mask, he refers to it as a ""face""; this is an indication that he spent a long, long time in the closet, so long that his own mask became his face until he took it off for good.

&amp;#x200B;

For the mask colors, it may be instructive for you to look up the 70s hanky code.  It is no accident that Panda is ""dirty"".

&amp;#x200B;

Sister Night's code is 1985.  Apart from the obvious, this is certainly revealing; I hope my cleverer readers can answer this one?  She also mispronounces ""cavalry"" as ""calvary""; whereas the former is a military unit, calvary is where a man was penetrated with wood.

&amp;#x200B;

The show has constant allusions to the race against time for transition.  As trans women like me know, every day waited past puberty delays the success of ""passing"".  Even the Cavalry shout, ""TICK TOCK"" in their video.  But see also the ""Minutemen"" ad, ""The countdown ends"" etc.  The Cavalry deftly point out the position of transgendered people in society, ""We are invisible"" and even put in a penis joke ""HOSED out"".

&amp;#x200B;

I have numerous more examples but I don't want to become too prolix.

{TL;DR: I identify more with the female gender, but am horrified of the medical dangers of transitioning and the long term effects. I've found that identifying as non-binary has brought me some ease, but I fear that I may just be suppressing my dysphoria again as I have for the last 14 years.}

 I cannot relate to my male anatomy, and I feel a strong sense of gender euphoria when associating with the female gender. I also feel somewhat at ease or at peace when associating with neither, however, there is less euphoria with this.

Now here's my predicament, I feel that my dysphoria strengthens when associating with the female gender while not physically being female. I have not transitioned in any way shape or form, and I am personally scared to do such. The reason being is that I feel like I'd be harming my body (mainly with HRT), and thus myself, to me there is no difference. I personally cannot bring myself to do anything that I know would harm myself. 

I know there are ways to treat certain problems that can arise with HRT, but there is so little information on long term effects and quite frankly I don't want to take that risk. Still I do not feel comfortable with my male anatomy, I never have. 

I have found that utilizing They/Them pronouns has been an easier route, it isn't perfect, but it is still better than being called he/him. I do not relate as strongly with the non-binary gender as I do the female gender, but this seems to be slightly easier on my mental health for now.

A good amount of years ago, my aunt came out as MtF trans. My dad did not accept her AT ALL and would constantly talk shit about her for being the way she was. When he told me, I personally did not think it was normal and thought they were a gross dumb-dumb. How my dad thought of her influenced that as well since he painted all of his family except him to be awful people. 

I thought this way for a couple years and kinda just forgot about it. Then I discovered some things on YouTube involving sexuality and gender and that completely changed my viewpoint. It made me realize that they are humans too and I really shouldn't judge people for those reasons. 

I think homophobic and transphobic people don't change like I did because a lot of them aren't okay with getting taught about it.

1261,2019-10-27 01:47:51,dnn3dg,5,4,"I‚Äôm almost 17 and I‚Äôm assigned female at birth. 
For the past 4+ years I‚Äôve wished to be someone that I‚Äôm not. 
For a year or so, I went by a different name by two of my friends, which was actually rarely used, sadly. 
For the majority of the past 4 years, I‚Äôve been wearing men‚Äôs clothes and wearing men‚Äôs deodorant. 
I try to deepen my voice, make my presence bigger and carry myself and sit like a man. 
I cut my hair as short as my mother would allow me to, which was only to the length of my shoulders and no higher. 

On a regular basis, I dream that people think I‚Äôm just a man. That‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt suspect that I‚Äôm originally a woman, they just think ‚Äòoh hey that‚Äôs a male man doing his job in male guys clothes‚Äô and that‚Äôs it.
That‚Äôs the dream. 

Being Bi hasn‚Äôt really made the gender questioning harder. It‚Äôs just Bi. So I don‚Äôt have to worry about saying straight or gay. Besides when I‚Äôm with family. With them they think I‚Äôm 100% into manly men. Menly man. 

So you‚Äôve read those 3 paragraphs. It seems pretty simple and straightforward, right? I‚Äôm totally trans. Male through and through as much as I can get away with while living with my family. But what if I told you that right now, at this very moment, I‚Äôm in bed with mascara smudged under my eyes like a panda because I couldn‚Äôt be bothered wiping my makeup off for one night. 

What if I told you that since I started sixth form, I‚Äôve been wearing makeup more often, being a makeup model for family and colleges and I‚Äôve been getting more womanly clothing in my wardrobes. 
I‚Äôm going by my original name, but as a double barrel too, so my name is extra girly. Different, but the same. 
I look in the mirror with my makeup on, feeling better about myself because I hate my face and my body and the only way I can feel a little better about myself is to slap on some heavy contour and concealer and lipstick and just smile at myself and everyone around me. 

Fake it until you make it. 

My longer hair is a nuisance, but I still style it for it to go over my semi-flat chest so people don‚Äôt notice how small it is. I don‚Äôt bind. My body just doesn‚Äôt like carrying boobage. 

And the thing is, I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a curse or a blessing. 

I‚Äôm asking for perfume and makeup for Christmas. I‚Äôm trying to get push up bra‚Äôs to woo boys but then deny them because it would be amusing. (A dick move but boys my age just think about sex so who cares). 

So you‚Äôve read the recent few paragraphs. So clearly, I was just a confused teenager and I‚Äôm slowly confirming to the roles and expectations of my assigned gender. 
I mean, it‚Äôs still happening their very moment. Makeup, pink pyjamas and painted nails with the remnants of my  perfume still barely hanging in the air. 

You can‚Äôt see the problem here, the whole gender ordeal has sorted itself out, I‚Äôm clearly born and mentally supposed to be a woman. I mean, that would be lovely but that‚Äôs not exactly what‚Äôs going on here. 
The whole girly makeup cisgender ordeal only started last month in September. But still, it‚Äôs sorted out, right?

Well there‚Äôs this feeling I have. 
Right now, I‚Äôm me, Marcey*. Right now I‚Äôm a woman. Me. I‚Äôm a whole person. 
But I feel this tugging in my heart when I see men that the Markus* me resembles closely to in my minds eye. 

I feel a connection and a deep understanding when I see posts, stories and videos of ftm people. I know their struggles with it. But I don‚Äôt. 

For about 4-5 years I‚Äôve been... someone else. That someone else is Mark. He was trans, came out to my friends and controlled my day to day life because he was me and he was part of my mind. You get me?

While he was there, I was sat inside my head on a chair. I could see the world and everything Mark was doing and saying but it was through a glass window. Everything was muffled too, because of the glass window which was my eyes. 
I was unaware of this, just accepting my place in the basic void. I was in and out of it throughout my whole life anyways. 

For some reason, 2 years ago I became self aware. I saw me sitting in my chair watching Marks actions and the consequences that followed. I watched the self harm he caused and heard his internal arguments on whether he should just end this vessel‚Äôs life or not. It was tough. 

He tried to bind with sports bras and he‚Äôs the one that tried to pass as a guy as much as he could without the family being suspicious. 

He was just another depressed, suicidal, reckless and confused trans kid. He needed support and to this day we still have none.

But since February 2019, this has all been getting better. I‚Äôve been taking more control, we‚Äôve been clean since Feb 27th and I took proper and full control in September. 

It‚Äôs been hard to be one person in one body bur it‚Äôs been worth it. I‚Äôve been healthier and my friend has told me I seem happier. I‚Äôve only actually felt real happiness for the first time this year when the depression finally lifted. 
(And yes, I‚Äôve never actually been able to experience actual true happiness even in childhood because of reasons that I don‚Äôt want to share but trust me I‚Äôve been in a depressed haze and I haven‚Äôt known who I am since early early childhood. Like at 4 years old. Y‚Äôknow, the age where you don‚Äôt know who you are and don‚Äôt have a personality anyways? Yeah try try tell me that once upon a time I wasn‚Äôt damaged because honey, I‚Äôve always been damaged and no I‚Äôm not being an edgy bitch, I seriously mean that I‚Äôve been fucked up for literally all of my life.)

Anyways, yeah. Since I‚Äôve been actually me for the first time truly ever, I‚Äôm seriously good. 

Back to the original question; am I transgender? 

Even as my cisgender self, I share the same dream and hopes and being and passing as male but I‚Äôm okay with who I am at the moment. 

I can feel him starting to come back though. Slowly. It‚Äôs odd and I hate it. I used to be so paranoid all the time thinking that people were watching and spying on me. I used to see and feel demons in my home. I used to see walls melt and people fade to the background as the bus I was on was submerged in dark water. 
I don‚Äôt want to be messed up again. 

Anyways, what‚Äôs your verdict on the matter? 
Trans? Not trans?

I‚Äôve only actually felt real happiness for the first time this year when the depression finally lifted. \n(And yes, I‚Äôve never actually been able to experience actual true happiness even in childhood because of reasons that I don‚Äôt want to share but trust me I‚Äôve been in a depressed haze and I haven‚Äôt known who I am since early early childhood. Like at 4 years old. Y‚Äôknow, the age where you don‚Äôt know who you are and don‚Äôt have a personality anyways? Yeah try try tell me that once upon a time I wasn‚Äôt damaged because honey, I‚Äôve always been damaged and no I‚Äôm not being an edgy bitch, I seriously mean that I‚Äôve been fucked up for literally all of my life.)\n\nAnyways, yeah. Since I‚Äôve been actually me for the first time truly ever, I‚Äôm seriously good. \n\nBack to the original question; am I transgender? \n\nEven as my cisgender self, I share the same dream and hopes and being and passing as male but I‚Äôm okay with who I am at the moment. \n\nI can feel him starting to come back though. Slowly. It‚Äôs odd and I hate it. I used to be so paranoid all the time thinking that people were watching and spying on me. I used to see and feel demons in my home. I used to see walls melt and people fade to the background as the bus I was on was submerged in dark water. \nI don‚Äôt want to be messed up again. \n\nAnyways, what‚Äôs your verdict on the matter? \nTrans? Not trans?\n\nThis has been my TED Talk. \nThanks for reading and sticking all the way though.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'What even is this; a confusing trans talk', 'created': 1572166071.0}"

But the other day I had a discussion where someone made me out to feel like a bigot. The basic premise of my point of that discussion?

That I feel nowadays people are conflating personality traits and personal ways of expressing themselves as genders or sexualities when it would just be easier to...not do that. 

So essentially what I mean is that I don‚Äôt personally subscribe to the idea that there are ‚Äúover 76 different‚Äù genders.

That‚Äôs just YOU.  And I think it‚Äôs undermining to the plight of the transgender community when people start bickering over something as simple as penis vs vaginas/ what makes someone a gender. 

I feel that applying a label to everything requires way more time and effort than anyone should even be allowing.  This convo came about partly because I was saying that while I am bisexual and have feminine tendencies I‚Äôve never really felt i identify as a woman even though I would be into things like wearing high heels or traditionally female clothing.

1313,2019-10-28 04:23:11,do3zhf,6,13,"Hi, folks. In the last few weeks, I've been thinking about some aspects of my sexuality and identity, and some doubts arose in the process.

A background: I'm a young man who has never been uncomfortable with my male body and identity. However, since I was a kid, I had the odd feeling that it was somehow weird I wasn't a girl. It's not easy to explain, but I've always thought that I would fit more neatly into a female body. This feeling never disappeared. It's not that I don't feel I'm a man, but I've always felt that, if I had the option, I'd rather be born as a woman. Since I was a boy, when I was home alone, I'd borrow some clothes and lipsticks from my mom and wear them. It felt good. I didn't know the word crossdressing back then, but when I first heard it, I immediately said to myself this is what I am, a crossdresser. There have been some years since I last wore female clothes, but I've decided that, when I live alone or have my own family, I will buy both male and female clothes. And no, crossdressing does not have any sexual connotation to me, I just feel good when I do it. Sometimes I think about how it would be like to transition. It is not something I really want to do, but I have some pleasure imagining how my life as a woman would be. At some point, I started to think a little bit more seriously about transitioning (since I like to imagine it a lot), but I have come to the conclusion that, to me, the drawbacks of the process would far outweigh the benefits, since I'm not really uncomfortable with being a male.

Nevertheless, despite all these feelings, I had never thought I might be transgender until now. To me, a transgender was necessarily someone with strong dysphoria. And I thought transgender and transsexual were synonymous. But I've been reading more about trans people because a close friend of mine came out of the closet as a trans man. I said to her (I'm using ""her"" because she still uses female pronouns) that I kinda get what she feels because I have this feeling that it was somehow strange not being a woman. This is not the same as being trans, I said to her, but I think I have a glimpse of your feelings. But after that, I started to question myself. Maybe being cis or being trans isn't something binary, I reasoned; maybe there is a spectrum between being a 100% cis or a 100% trans, and I'm closer to the cis end, but not totally cis. I don't know if it makes any sense, or if it sounds right to trans people. In a Reddit thread, I saw a trans person saying they believe that, contrary to what most people (trans folks included) believe, gender dysphoria is not a precondition for being trans. Maybe I'm a trans person without dysphoria, I said to myself. And then I discovered that transgender and transsexual are not the same, that transgender is an umbrella term with a wider meaning than transsexual.

So, I've decided to consult trans people, to see what they think about my situation.

I'm a 22 year old pre-HRT transgirl (I plan on starting HRT in January when my medical benefits kick in) who first became aware of dysphoric feelings and made the decision to start transitioning last January.

I wasn't able to sleep last night, so I spent most of it watching Thought Slime videos, and in the last one I watched he related a personal anecdote about a mental illness-related experience which he previously thought to be a uniquely shameful aspect of his personality, only to have a friend offhandedly mention that it's actually a pretty common occurrence among people with mental illness and was nothing to apologize about or feel ashamed over, and what he related struck a bit of a chord with me about a particular pattern in my own experiences over the past 9 months or so (which is to say, since I initially identified the emotions I've been feeling as being dysphoric)

Essentially there seems to be a sort of irregular cycle where I'll feel really intensely dysphoric for a while, and then it'll recede and I feel mostly alright for a while, to the point that I can hardly remember what it felt like to get hit with the dysphoria stick like that, until it inevitably happens again

The thing is when I hit the ""feeling okay"" part of that cycle, there's a part of me that feels, like, embarrassed or guilty, like maybe I'm blowing this whole thing out of proportion since clearly I'm capable of functioning fine at least part of the time in my current state, and at times I'll start to doubt the legitimacy of my dysphoric phases

Obviously on a rational level I know this is absurd, especially since there's such a clear pattern of the dysphoria returning eventually, but it's just this irrational feeling down in my subsconscious that I'm somehow less of a ""real"" transgirl because of these periods of feeling kind of okay; What I'm curious about is whether anyone here has had a similar experience?

I am a cis hetero middle school Spanish teacher who is very LGBT friendly, but admittedly I am a newbie when it comes to certain things. Today in class, one of my students disclosed to me privately (and with much trepidation, bless him!)  that he is in the closet FTM trans. He felt the need to tell me because we are doing a project on personality traits and adjectives in Spanish have gender, so he wanted to know if he could submit his project privately and have permission to use masculine adjectives. 

The initial interaction was quite brief as it occurred at the end of class, but I quietly told him that of course he may do the assignment this way. I smiled and that was it. I walked out of class with a bit of a shock to the system as I was not expecting him to tell me this and I was incredibly touched that he felt he could bring this to me. 

During my planning period, I reached out asking for him to see me at the end of the day. I discretely pulled him out of study hall and told him that I wanted to follow up about what he had told me. I asked him if he was out as I assumed he was not. He confirmed this and so I told him I will continue to use female pronouns and his current name so as not to tip off his fellow students and teachers and that was mostly the extent of the conversation. However I am now thinking it is very probable his parents/the school counselors do not know about his being trans and so I think it would be good if I could find some online resources for a student his age. He is in the 8th grade. Of course I will do my part to be a support system but I do not have many trans people in my life and do not at all feel an authority on the subject.

1426,2019-10-30 02:34:23,dp0nty,15,3,"Hello! I am a straight woman and I have been wondering why are trans people trans? 

Disclaimer!!!
I genuinely do not know anything about the trans community except the difference between a trans Male and trans female so I DO NOT mean to offend anyone with my question I would just like some insight and understanding. I am not looking for a debate or to bait anyone or anything like that so with that being said here are my questions:

1)Basically I want to know why someone would become transgender...so for instance if a woman decides to become a man are they doing it because they dont like the rules their society has placed on female and male roles? But then how does that differ from a tomboy and just saying you dont like the things typically associated with a woman?

Would trans people exist if we lived in a world without gender roles?

2) What is the purpose of surgery and or hormones?

1431,2019-10-30 05:00:53,dp277m,7,6,"Hi. My name is wren, and I'm 16. I'm MtF and came out to my parents around 7 or 8 months ago, but I was speaking to my therapist about it in January and have felt this way for a long time. When I came out to my mom and dad, I sent them a 12 paragraph email explaining what gender dysphoria was, and how it affected me day to day. I have done my best to educate them (mainly my mom) about hormone blockers, socially transitioning, and ways of alleviating dysphoria. When explaining why I was telling them now rather than some other time, I said that my body image issues and feeling like I was in the wrong set of skin was getting in the way of me being happy. That it was important to me, urgent, and something that I couldn't afford to not address.

I was struggling with depression a lot last year, and this year, things seemed to get a little better. But I was still just scraping by and taking things day to day. As a result of that along with my gender identity stuff, my parents sent me to a therapeutic wilderness program. They, along with my ed consultant decided that it would be the ""best therapeutic fit"" for me to be placed in the male group, even though I was presenting as and identifying as female. It ended up being a wonderful growing experience for me. All of the staff, and pretty much all of the students, were extremely supportive and were able to create an environment where I felt welcome. It did feel more than a little invalidating being the only girl in the group though.

After 3 months in wilderness, I was transitioned to a Residential Treatment Center in Utah. It was pretty good at addressing gender dysphoria, and allowed for students to stay in the dorm that aligned with their gender identity. But my parents and ed consultant chose to place me in a male dorm again. It felt heartbreaking to me, because I was surrounded by people who were wondering why I wasn't in the girls dorm. There were like 3 trans guys on my hall who were allowed to start on the male dorm.

I talked to my therapist there, Phyllis, about it and she said, ""I don't know why you are in the male dorm. I would have expected you to start on Rise (the female/ nonbinary dorm) but your parents must not have pushed for it."" 

I was also told by my parents that they felt they couldn't safely lead me down the path of transitioning, and that anything with hormones would be put on hold for a little while. 

I got pulled out of that place after a few weeks (average stay is a year) because of physical sexual harassment and intimidation. One of the guys ended up jumping me and busting my lip open while his friend taunted and called me a faggot. A few days after that people were making fun of me for how I got my ass kicked. I ended up telling my parents that I couldn't take it anymore, and that I was going to kill myself if I had to be tormented every day. 

Now I've been home for around a month. Even though my experience at a residential was awful, I've been able to start getting back on my feet again pretty quickly. Wilderness has really stuck with me, and I love carving spoons and knives, along with helping my father with trapping and making a fire pit to cook on. But one glaring thing is still stressing me out.

My family just isn't there yet. While my mom is trying, and her side of the family has been surprisingly supportive, my sister doesn't even want to be seen with me. She wont call me Wren or she/her, because she feels like she's loosing her big brother. No matter how much I tell her that I've always had her back, that I'm the same person I've always been, and that I'll continue to love and support her no matter what. She still can't accept it. She's afraid of having her friends find out about me, and it hurts like nothing has ever hurt before.

And my parents still haven't even scheduled an appointment with an endocrinologist. We live in West Virginia, so traveling plus the six month wait can be a pain, but knowing that it's not even being worked on drives me up the wall. I feel like they're just expecting me to sit here and grow a beard and one day say that I'm not trans anymore. Hell, I've had a full psychological evaluation where the psychiatrist was hammering in the message that I am genuinely identifying as female and that it's not something that I can help. BUT THEY STILL WONT TREAT MY LIKE I'M THEIR DAUGHTER. I'm not mad at them, I'm just frustrated with the situation. Because it feels like everything just goes in one ear and out the other, and that they're never actually going to see me as female. 

If they actually believed me, why would they be worried about even starting me on blockers? It should have been LITERALLY THE FIRST THING that they did after having the appointment with my therapist in March where I came out to them and she explained that I have gender dysphoric disorder. It's so irresponsible to put me in a position where I'm looking down the barrel of irreversible changes that I don't want to have happen to me. I could get it if they weren't comfortable blindly rushing down the road of HRT without sperm banking first. That's okay and I understand it. I can even understand their anxiety around the current situation. 

I love my parents so much, and at the same time they are putting me through the most stressful limbo imaginable. I'm sorry for ranting. I just really need some virtual hugs, and people telling me that they have been in the same place.

A KY state representative is trying to prevent transgender children from being able to obtain the healthcare that they need with blatant misinformation about the case that happened with Luna, the 7yr old trans child who was shoved into the media and made a political pawn for right-wing news organizations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where we come in, I do NOT at all condone harassment or any sort of pointed or angry language at this woman. We need to explain ourselves in a way that isn't accusatory or hateful.

&amp;#x200B;

All we need to tell her is;

&amp;#x200B;

1)What our childhood was like growing up as trans\* and seeing the changes that happened to our bodies,

&amp;#x200B;

2) Why transgender youth need medical transition available to prevent suicide in kids who are denied the chance to prevent a mentally damaging puberty.

Link articles with statistics if you can.

&amp;#x200B;

3) If you have time, write about Luna and how her case was distorted by news organizations. You can watch a video about Luna's case here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvjHn6QEgh4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvjHn6QEgh4)

And it stayed that way until about 11 months ago. Around that time I realized hmmm, I don‚Äôt like my chest. When I tried on clothes they always stuck out somehow. They felt wrong and suffocating.

1469,2019-10-31 03:21:23,dphu9q,2,5,"Traditonally, how often have you heard cis men say cis women are a mystery, impossible to comprehend or decipher? And how often have you heard cis women say cis men are from another planet or emotionless or unable to communicate? Obviously these are stereotypes, but it sort of hit me how for cis people, the opposite gender is often something hard for them to understand. 

And then, within genders, often some cis women feel they cannot understand other cis women. Hence, ""I'm not like the other girls."" Same with cis men who can't understand a man who gets anywhere near something feminine unless it's done as a joke. Or even how there are just so many different brands of femininity and masculinity that cis people will judge each other for.

So then, why do cis people think it's so weird that they can't understand transgender people or non binary people? Cis people cannot even understand each other's concepts of gender. And same for transgender people. Why would a transgender person think being unable to understand someone else's gender, like a binary trans person being unable to understand a non binary person, why would they then decide it makes the other person's gender not real?

And sometimes I wonder, can ftms and mtfs really understand each other? Like yes they can, on a lot of levels, but at the same time, it can feel like the differences can be as wide as between experiences of cis men and cis women. Because they are on paths in such opposite directions. In shared meme subs for example there can a bit of an awkward divide when the same meme that makes one group euphoric makes the other group dysphoric, you know?

But still, women and men, both trans and cis, and non binary, can still have more in common with each other and more differences within groups. Everyone is an individual and not defined just by their group categorizations.

But I just think no one really understands gender or the experiences of various others and this even happens within the cis binary. As well as in trans binary.

Not that understanding doesn't happen between very different people, it happens a lot and it is great and should be cultivated.

But if someone lacks understanding of another person's gender, that person who can't understand shouldn't be surprised that they can't understand and just immediately invalidate them. They maybe should take a step back and realize that maybe the universe is much wider and more diverse than the scope of their own understanding.",trans,A long rambling thought about gender,1572517283.0,"{'created_utc': 1572492083, 'id': 'dphu9q', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Traditonally, how often have you heard cis men say cis women are a mystery, impossible to comprehend or decipher?

So, by assigned gender is male, and I wanna know how I can low key transition without hormones or surgery, and by that I mean, how can I make myself more feminine without anyone noticing? And the other thing I wanna ask is, how can I convince my family to accept my true identity? My mom‚Äôs very conservative, and my dad doesn‚Äôt trust me.

1495,2019-10-31 15:08:05,dpoulj,0,3,"I feel terrible this morning because I was reminded of somethings that happened when I first started dating. Well I dated a bit as a teen but my gender and sexuality issues caused me to always break things out or flat out say no to any romantic anything, I do love romance but I just don‚Äôt think sex is hot in anyway. So when I got in my first real relationship it was definitely pretty abusive, there were a few times during sex he would grab my penis despite me saying before we ever even went on one date that I am never ever ok with that. I‚Äôd stop everything and I‚Äôd say *what the hell? You know I‚Äôm not ok with that*. And half the time he‚Äôd fake cry and swear he‚Äôd never do it again. There was also tons of emotional abuse, insulting me and breaking me down but I just wish I didn‚Äôt stay because I feel like such an idiot putting up with it for any length of time. I found out after we broke up he‚Äôs a TERF (like a feminist but bigoted against trans people) that was trying to convince me to identify as a feminine gay man instead of a trans woman. When I dumped him he told me he‚Äôd never do it again and cried, maybe even not fake that time. 

Then a few months after that I went on a few dates with a very attractive guy to test if I was asexual because I‚Äôd begun to realize, I‚Äôm in my 20s and never once got off to the thought of sex but having only been with one person I thought he was just bad at it. So eventually I had ads with this guy and I hated it, even though he was hitting the right spot physically and had a pretty big dick. That part I consented to, I wanted to know if I liked sex and I don‚Äôt. What I didn‚Äôt consent to was him sneaking snapping photos of my penis while we were having sex. It was the first time I‚Äôd gotten fully naked in a sexual context as I always wore underwear to cover the front with my ex. I just believed this new guy that he wouldn‚Äôt touch it, which he didn‚Äôt but the picture taking was about as bad if not worse. I feel like there‚Äôs a huge issue around trans porn and it treating trans women as a fetish, like it‚Äôs such a novelty to him that I have that. I want someone to like me in spite of my penis, not because of it. It feels like having a skin condition or self harm scars or something and rather than people ignoring them they like you because of it and want to focus on it a lot. Not all guys I‚Äôve dated were like that but too many of them were what we call *chasers*, they chase trans girls a lot and are creepy about it. Anyway, this guy was like 6‚Äô7 and I was in his house so this one I don‚Äôt know how I could‚Äôve stood up for myself other than leaving as soon as I felt like it was safe to do so. I was afraid of him because he was so big and tall. 

Last one I‚Äôll talk about, I went on a date with this one guy who seemed really nice. We chatted for weeks online before meeting up, when we met up he was completely different. He was trying to run his hand up my skirt multiple times and I pushed his hand away and said no, then after that he took out his dick and was asking me to blow him. I feel so mad at myself for actually doing it. I should‚Äôve just left.

Alright guys, background time. So I've been identifying as Non-Binary-ish for about a year now. In my personal life I identify as NB especially with my wife and friends. I'm not ""out of the closet"" with most of my family or at work, mostly because my family is still getting used to me being the blue-haired left-wing lesbian, and it would be an uphill battle to start the gender-is-a-spectrum discussion. Professionally, I work with young students with severe social-emotional disorders, so I'm not a fan of opening that can of worms and changing pronouns and such. I was born female and dress more or less feminine at work (skinny jeans, blouses, cardigans). 

If you're still with me, thank you for making it this far. Now onto the struggle

I bolt into the nearest bathroom, do what I need to do, start to walk out, and realize I was in the men's room. Now it was a DAY at work, and I was exhausted. I barely noticed the dude at the urinal. What got me was the Male-parental-figure who became very apologetic and began backing out of the bathroom with his young child. THEN i realized i was in the ""wrong"" restroom. And I immediately became embarrassed and apologetic, stating I was in the wrong room. 

Whutt?? 

On my walk back to my wife, I began to wonder what I had to apologize and be embarrassed for. I (personally) don't identify as male or female. It's not like anyone saw my ""private squares"". So what the heck?? 

Those of you who have been on this journey for a while, how did you ""get over"" this embarrassment/low-level fear? Does anyone have tips to help me gain confidence as an NB person? 

If you made it all the way down here, thank you for your time and consideration. I apologize for the wall of text.

For roughly 10 years I have been wanting to be both femme and masc (I am AMAB for context). I never felt welcome when I expressed these feelings to people who didn‚Äôt experience them. On and off depression, constant self-hatred, a controlling and abusive girlfriend, and other negativity kept me from exploring these feelings for 10 years. 10 years of thinking that I missed out on the real me and knowing that I was too cowardly to do anything about it. 

But in the last few months I have found communities of enbies and more broadly trans people online and IRL. By being so accepting of me and everyone else questioning, I found the courage to address my feelings and act on them.

So today I finally did it. I went to the store with my extremely supportive partner and she helped me find a cute dress and get the right undershirt to wear with it. When I had the outfit finished and went to the mirror it made me feel so good, like nothing I‚Äôve ever felt before. I liked my body and how it looked for the first time in I don‚Äôt even know how long. I wept tears that came with the 1000 emotions I felt. They were happy for living the rest of my life as me but sad for having waited so long. 

So, thanks to y‚Äôall and my enbies and trans siblings everywhere, I‚Äôm doing it. I‚Äôm coming out to my classmates, my friends, and my acquaintances. I‚Äôm telling people to use they/them and call me by a new name, one that I based on my old name I chose.

Pseudoscience 
    -Noun
‚Äúa collection of beliefs or practices mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method.‚Äù

Gender Studies is a Pseudoscience because:
a) It has no scientific evidence proving it
b) There has been no psychological or biological cases in which a person has been neither gender (with the exception of intersex cases)
c) Universities commonly mistake this topic as a science, instead of social science (which is more philosophy than it is science)

If gender studies was the study of sexes (male and female) than it would be a science, although a very brief science.

So, in 2017 I told a friend I thought I was non-binary and began exploring my gender identity. I was first met with a lot of support, but romantic or sexual partners didn‚Äôt seem to understand (or want to). 

When i was in high school, I was out to my father as bisexual, and had my first girlfriend which he accepted fully, and was supportive. He raised me on his own, with my mom being absent, so it was simple. 

However, now my parents are remarried after a 15 year separation. I have a trans cousin, and my mom claims that she loves him so much, but constantly uses incorrect pronouns when speaking about him and uses his dead name. I always try to teach her, but she doesn‚Äôt change. 

Recently I got married and my partner (cis pan man) and I‚Äôs friends flew in, all of different variants of queer. it was such a happy and warm part of it all. My two enby best friends flew in and I talked to my parents before hand on how to use the correct pronouns for them, and my dad said, ‚Äòoh ok it‚Äôs simple, just don‚Äôt overthink it!‚Äô, while my mom consistently misgendered my friends. I obviously stood up for them bc it made me mad and also hurt my feelings bc I know she would do the same to me if she knew I was enby. 

My in-laws are incredibly transphobic, and my husband got kicked out at a very young age because he was romantically involved with a trans woman. That being said, I don‚Äôt feel safe or comfortable at all coming out to them. 

I‚Äôve been in my marital apartment for 4 months now and it‚Äôs done wonders for my freedom of gender expression since I don‚Äôt see anyone in my life who is outwardly transphobic to me, but I am also not out to anyone but my friends. I‚Äôve been able to really grow into my authentic self these last few months. being able to dress masc whenever I want, got a new more masc haircut, etc. I‚Äôm becoming confident in my gender and am at a point where i‚Äôm tired of hiding who I am. it‚Äôs exhausting, and hurts me emotionally. 

So my question is- how do I come out to family? how did you teach older people in your life what being enby is? 

it is to the point where it depresses me to have to pretend like a woman. I don‚Äôt like using she/her pronouns at all. I feel like the older folks in my life understand being a trans woman or man, but think being non-binary is fake or doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Any comments, advice, help, etc would be much appreciated!

When I try to talk about it people say it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm still searching for my femininity or because I used to wear my brother‚Äôs clothes when I was young (as my style is more masculine)so this mixed things up in my mind.
Even If like to occasionally wear dresses skirt and other feminine attires. the only reason I mostly wear boy clothes is because they are more pleasant for me in general (bigger pockets, sweeter fabric, easier to move in it or more acceptable to get dirty in) and no other reason

Before puberty, I liked dresses and feminine clothes. In fact, I chose to wear dresses and skirts even when I had the option to wear pants on some occasions. I wasn't that confused about which side of the gender binary I fell on. I never recoiled when referred to as a girl. I did strongly dislike the little-girl femininity associated with female childhood: I never played with dolls, preferring rather gender-neutral stuffed animals. I didn't like Disney princesses, pink, or playing school... but I was pretty damn sure I was a girl, if not a feminine one. I had all-female friends (though I was basically bullied out of having male friends by public accusations that I, a third grader, was dating them).

When I moved to a different school (located in a liberal city where people didn't think being gay was a sin!) I started to dress more masculine. As I saw girls wear formal slacks instead of skirts, I made that change in my own closet. And throughout early puberty (around the time when I switched schools), I found myself getting excited for symptoms that I knew would never appear. I was psyched to start shaving my face and/or growing a beard. I wanted that 12-inches-in-three-months male growth spurt *bad*. Yeah, voice cracks suck, but I knew that I could get through them for the sweet, sweet reward of a deep voice. Of course, at some level I knew that these changes wouldn't occur, and I was still happy for some parts of female puberty: I was excited about my first period, for example, but not really because it ""made me a woman"" so much as because it was a sign I was getting older.

So, I have never really been with a woman. I‚Äôm only realizing now that I have some internalized misogyny (or more accurately, gynophobia) that was likely the result of my mom having postpartum depression, and a sadistic school teacher, as well as the usual ‚Äúmean girl‚Äù stuff in my tweens and teens. So I can barely pursue a friendship with another woman, forget about a romance! I feel attracted to women from afar, but I think I have some kind of psychosexual block when it comes to the idea of actually being intimate with another woman...

But... I can see myself being with a trans woman, especially if she has a penis. I‚Äôve become obsessed with the idea recently, fantasizing in more detail than ever before (even in my previous fantasies about men). 

I realize that I might be harmful to a trans woman if I pursued her irl, risking fetishizing her penis just like cis male ‚Äúchasers‚Äù do. Ew. I don‚Äôt want to be like that! But I do really want a woman with a penis, a woman who has been socialized as a male initially, because that makes her less threatening to me. Isn‚Äôt that a switcheroo of the normal story, where natal *females* are supposed to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. But I‚Äôm talking about emotional safety, as opposed to physical safety.

I can‚Äôt help my desires, though. All I can do is try to work through them logically, so that I don‚Äôt end up accidentally hurting someone. 

I feel like I‚Äôm coming up against some kind of contradiction regarding gender. Like, I can‚Äôt figure out whether a woman proudly displaying her dick is masculine, like a creepy flasher, or feminine, like a stripper taking her top off to reveal her boobs. To me, it‚Äôs neither, really: I just love the way pretty women look, as well as how penises look, and the idea of combining them is hot to me. Is that transphobic? I feel like my sexuality is way ahead of my logical mind; like my sex drive doesn‚Äôt care about gender at all, it‚Äôs post-gender, and just wants what it wants, but when I try to analyze and dissect my desire, it starts to confuse me.

Any other AFABs out there who have similar desires? Or anyone who has more experience dealing with trans women‚Äôs penises without producing dysphoria in them? I just don‚Äôt see this subject come up very often, so I‚Äôm a bit lost.

Oh, the other problematic thing is that I think I have legit Penis Envy. But I wonder if I found another woman who has what I want, if we could sort of share it. Is that a thing?

5,2019-10-01 19:07:59,dby3x4,2,6,"Hello, I am new to this community and posting on Reddit.

A little bit of backstory and the like:

Straight (but comfortable), White, Male. Raised Catholic, Living Non-Religious. mid-20s. Grew up in a rougher neighborhood with a LOT of white, toxic masculinity, wannabe gangstas.

I have always been a supporter of LGBTQIA+, living non-gender conforming. Basically: live however you want to live, I don't mind as long as you're kind.

But recently. I have for the first time turned the question inward. I recently started drama school and we have to wear leotards for dance (which I didn't mind as I used to do Rocky Horror and used to having fabric up the crack). And a few of the girls were teasing the men (who were horrified at wearing a thong, tights, and a leotard). 

And I was extremely upset, as I didn't feel like I should have been grouped up with these men. (also, not cool making fun of people. I'm used to being bullied, but this felt different). 

I've always hated toxic masculinity (as a I think men are the DEVIL), but I love ""traditional male-things"" playing sports (not watching), weight lifting, and the like. So I always just assumed...I'm male... But I always felt different to everyone else. So I thought ""Maybe I'm bisexual."" Tried it. Not attracted to men. ANYWAYS. I've always tried to live however I want, and be who I am. Which is to live label-free, but I've never put it to gender. 

I have a few Facebook friends who have transitioned or non-binary, and, I don't know, I admire and respect the community, and feel like if I were non-binary, that I would be disrespecting all of them and the community because I don't ""fit"" or I'm not truly ""non-binary or genderqueer"" (hyperbole to hopefully show the painting my mind is trying to convey). Those Facebook friends are a radical bunch though, as they very much hate cis straight men (understandably).

I'm not sure what I'm wanting out of this post. Kinda got away from me. I have a new friend at drama school who identifies as genderqueer (never heard it before) who encouraged me to keep exploring (idk how though). So maybe this is me exploring? 

I'm sorry if I somehow offend someone by my wording, this is all completely with good intentions. You're all wonderful.

Neutro, Neuta or Neutra (from neutrois)

Demi or Demu (like demigender)

Mahu or mahi (from the Hawaiian term of mahu for nonbinary people)

Xi, Xixi, Xeni, or Xo (from xenogender)

34,2019-10-06 23:22:16,deb5n9,24,18,"I'm bad at explaining these things so please bear with me.

So I've heard conflicting ideas on the term 'trans' in relation to NB/genderqueer (i'll use NB from here on out for brevity) people. I like to think I'm usually quite educated on these things, but this has really confused me: are all NB people inherently trans? I would think not, right? As not all people who are nb feel the need to transition (though some obviously do want HRT, binders, name change etc). 

Take me as an example: I'm AFAB, but identify as agender/genderfluid/genderqueer/nb (no one label does it justice) and I've never taken any steps to transition. My whole life I've just presented in a way that feels right to me, I've never been offended by or felt extremely wrong about being considered female, I've never cared what name or pronouns people use, so I don't consider myself trans because there's no transition. Yes my AGAB doesn't entirely align to my gender experience, but I also have never needed to do anything to actively change.

HOWEVER, even though I don't consider myself trans (and I would think there's other NB people out there who feel similarly), NB always seems to fall under the trans umbrella and be considered a 'trans' identity. It seem to be a conflict between how I view myself and how my identity is ""defined"" in the broader LGBT+ community.

I don't have a real question here, I'm just looking for if there's something I've missed, or if I'm just dealing with misconceptions about being nb, or if anyone has an statistics/info on how people categorise these things. So thank you in advance for any help illuminating this topic for me!

Note 1: This isn't about gender dysphoria, I'm aware that one does not need to experience it to be considered trans and/or nb

There have been large stretches of my life where I have been more than happy being male. Particularly the last 6 years I will go months to years with being satisfied with my current body. There have been times where I have wondered if this is nothing more than a fetish, others where it seems like more. Which has lead to  a lot   
 of cross dressing. I remember  in middle school first seeing that HRT was a thing on youtube I though it was magic and part of me wishing I could do that. A lot of times the place I have ended up is me wishing I could somehow shift between a male and female body at will. The past few months or so has been more intense than before with the desire to be more feminine and its getting more intense each day.Recently I found out about informed consent and am seriously considering it. I am really afraid if I do not fully explore this side of who I am  then I will be living out my older years constantly wondering ""What If?"".  My set of likes and dislikes  about the way I am also make me more confused. I think would like to be a young woman, but I think once I am older I would prefer to be an older man. I also don't mind having male genitals and don't think I would want to get rid of them. There are times where I like having a beard and being a rugged mountain boi, but then there are times where I wish so badly I could be a slender and soft woman with a feminine haircut and makeup. I don't believe my family would understand, but I live in a separate city. My significant other has heard some of these thoughts and is very accepting of my desire to explore,  she is bi and some what non-binary so I am fully confident that she will support me no matter what. My other concern is related to my job. I am afraid that as a transwoman or nonbinary person I will limit my job opportunities in my career. I feel shitty about it, but part of me feels that I will just have an easier time progressing as a cis het male and having a secure career matters to me. I am also afraid that if I start HRT at some point but then back out I will be left with several negative side effects I dont want. I  am almost considering scheduling an appointment for informed consent partially so I can sit with a medical professional and they can lay out what all the medical effects will really be.  I do have some general questions though I was wondering  if I can get some input on as these are some of my primary concerns.

\-Is it do-able to effectively continue to present as male/androgynous at work while going through HRT/exploring, but maintain a more feminine person outside of work?

\-I understand shrinkage of the male genitals occurs once you have been on HRT for a few months (as well as other effects such as permanent sterility and losing the ability to get an erection). If I decided somewhere down the line that I had found out what I needed and decided to go off HRT,  would any size/function return to my genitals?

The rabbit hole is becoming very enticing and I am just worried whether I will be able to climb back out depending on how far I go down. I feel like I just need to explore this part of myself more to be happy in the long term and crossdressing hasn't really been doing it for me.

49,2019-10-09 15:42:44,dfiu9x,7,35,"I‚Äôll preface by saying I still feel like I have a lot to learn about gender, but recently have felt like this may be where I belong.  That being said I still have constant doubts for various reasons.

I‚Äôm a 32 y.o.  and for years I thought I was a crossdresser or fetishist, but I now think that may have been due to limited knowledge or what I had been exposed to.  My first experience was around the age of ten, I found myself get curious and try on a family members clothes. I loved it and would share a handful of experiences in my teenage years but was limited due to age and accessibility of clothes.

In my 20s it was mostly panties as I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know about it and they were easy to wear without anyone knowing, but I had the desire to wear leggings and dresses and all sorts of clothes. The desire to wear men‚Äôs clothes remained, though I found myself getting increasingly bored when shopping in men‚Äôs sections as the years went on.  About mid 20s I started to find sections of the internet filled with other crossdressers and began to realize I was not as alone as I had previously thought. I think this had Both a positive and negative affect on me as it turned something that wasn‚Äôt previously sexual in nature into a fetish that I‚Äôd debatably abuse over the next few years. More recently I realize that it‚Äôs not a fetish as I enjoy being dressed in women‚Äôs clothes even when not participating in sexual acts. That being said most the time I feel like mixing clothes, something like a men‚Äôs flannel with leggings and earrings and maybe makeup.  

I‚Äòve been considering this is more than just clothes. When I think about my younger years I can recall I never felt like I fit in with other boys and masculinity in general. Everyone loved sports and cars and locker room talk. Not to say you can‚Äôt be feminine and into those things, but I definitely found cooking and gardening to be more my style. I also found talking to women easier, they were always more relatable and I‚Äôve always found making friendships with men to be difficult.

My problem is that I‚Äôve hid al of it my entire life. Any time I ever showed off bits of a feminine personality or tried to share my crossdressing with a gf it was often met with hostility. These types of reactions led me to bury and pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm finding as I get older I can‚Äôt stand it, I can‚Äôt keep pretending, I need to be who I am. But the world feels like it has barely changed, and I just dont know how to be me. It is easy to internally say yes I think I may be genderqueer, but when I try to say it out loud I always stop myself and ask am I sure? Because once I open the box it will be out there for everyone.

To make it more complicated, I am married now. My wife is very accepting and enthusiastic towards others but I‚Äôm less certain of how she would react if her own husband came out. I‚Äôve tried my best to keep this short but the reality is this feels so complicated and plagued me on a daily basis and my thoughts on the matter seem never ending.

56,2019-10-11 05:47:19,dgapg6,5,61,"\[Originally posted on r/NonBinary \- thought I would post here as well.\] 

Wanted to share this with some other non-binary/gender neutral folks whose parents are having a hard time accepting them.

My parents have always been extremely critical of me for not fitting their heteronormative expectations about gender identity and sexual orientation ever since I was a young child. Born anatomically female, they foisted every pink, frilly ""girl"" things onto me - clothes, toys, hobbies, everything - as well as punished me for not behaving in a typically ""feminine"" way. Since I was a little kid, I was always a tomboy, and anything my brother was allowed to do, I wanted to do, too. My parents thought it was a tomboy phase and that once I became an adolescent I would become all feminine and be interested in boys (this is a long discussion for another time). As I got older and that never happened, and my interests, mannerisms, and behavior became less and less what they wanted or expected, this caused a huge rift (among other reasons) between my parents and me.

I've had a gender neutral name for almost 10 years now, and it was quite a chore to even get my parents to stop calling me by my (extremely girly and old-fashioned) given name. My mother still refuses, and gets angry and screams at me when I correct her. My father begrudgingly began to call me by my preferred name last year, though he often forgets and I have to remind him.

I'll be 29 in a few days. I always dreaded getting cards from my parents for any occasion because, even from hundreds of miles away, they always still seemed to be trying to enforce their beliefs about my gender onto me. Like they would find the most girly looking cards, with pink and hearts and cursive script and lace and whatever, always for ""daughter"", addressed to ""given name"". This used to bother me so much I threw their cards out without even reading them for many years, because it felt so invalidating and disrespectful. This was even after telling them over and over to please not send me these types of things, and they would always counter by saying something like ""none of the other cards were appropriate"" (???) or they would just get angry and tell me I'm a woman so I better start acting like one.

Today I got a birthday card from my father, and I was surprised to see that it is nothing like the cards he usually sends. It was in a yellow envelope. It's very colorful, but mostly blue and green. It has a cute doggy sketch on the front with balloons and a present. The script, while still cursive, is black. It doesn't say ""daughter"" anywhere. It's addressed to my preferred name.

It's really very touching, because it seems he went out of his way to try to find the most unoffensive and gender neutral card that he could. Honestly, I teared up a little when I saw it. I'm sure a lot of people are rolling their eyes right now saying I'm overreacting or being a sensitive wuss or a special snowflake or whatever nonsense, but it's so different from how it's always been. It's such a little thing but it means a lot to me. I never thought either one of my parents would ever be accepting or try to understand at all (my mother still refuses; my parents divorced several years ago, but that's neither here nor there). I've noticed too, over the last few months, my father has been asking me about gender identity and LGBTQIA issues in general, not like he's trying to be offensive or anything, but like he's genuinely curious and wants to understand. He also corrects himself more when he calls me by my given name. I have no idea why he's suddenly being like this, because he never was. If he didn't agree with something or experience it himself, he thought it was stupid or not real. My step-mom, though, is much more open-minded than either of my parents ever were, so maybe she's been a good influence on him.

I just wanted to share this. If anyone is having trouble getting through to their parents or if their parents refuse to accept you for who you are, one day they might realize their mistakes and come around. My father is nearing old age now, and he's lived the majority of his life being very black and white in his beliefs.

Now my actual question is about bottom dysphoria, I don't think what I'm experiencing is dysphoria but I'm not sure if it's euphoria either?

Is there a word for this?

I'm a male in my early 20s, and I've always been perfectly happy with this. I love traditionally guy things (sports, movies, video games), but I also have really traditionally ""girly"" taste at the same time (movies/TV, music, and clothes) and have some pretty feminine habits and mannerisms. The big thing is that for as long as I can remember, I've loved wearing women's clothes. Not necessarily full blown crossdressing with makeup and stuff, but I've loved all clothes; skirts, leggings, heels, flats, cardigans, panties, etc. I'm not confident enough to go out in public looking so feminine, but I do like to subtly wear a few women's clothing pieces with my more traditionally male clothes (ie skinny jeans/heeled booties with a men's top/coat). However, it's not really all the time that I feel the inclination to wear women's clothes. Maybe 50% of the time, I'm very content wearing ""guy clothes"". Sexually, I'm only really attracted to women, and can't really imagine myself ever being different here.

I love being a guy, and have never considered changing that, but I do occasionally think about how cool it would be to be a woman. To be able to go out in skirts and heels and act traditionally feminine without judgement. So here comes the questions I have:

1. Am I just a feminine, occasionally crossdressing man? Or is there some other label that more directly applies to me?
2. Based on my description of myself, are there more people out there similar to me, or am I pretty unique? I'm not trying to sound entitled/special or anything here, I just really don't know. I've tried doing more research, but a lot of stuff on quora/answers that I've found just seem like validation shitposts.
3. Do people in this community generally like labels? Do you like to be associated with your labels, or are they just sort of there to easily explain yourself to other likeminded individuals?

I sometimes feel like I don\'t belong there with my skinniness and hoodies, and that nobody will take my competence seriously on account of those. Any thoughts? I don\'t really want to change the way I present - in fact I\'ve been thinking of cutting my already short hair shorter, which will probably only make me look more boyish rather than more grownup. Maybe what I need is some more of that mythical attitude called self confidence and it doesn\'t have anything to do with looks. I don\'t know, would anyone like to talk about it? I need some sympathy and understanding for my first world problems.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""Do you ever worry that you don't look your age?"", 'created': 1571197860.0}"

This may be a long one, as it‚Äôs my first post. Or it may be short! Either way I‚Äôll keep the grace of this opening blurb.

I‚Äôm AFAB, mid-20s. When I was about 5 or 6, I used to admire the boys most in shows I watched; quite literally Barney, Power Rangers, etc. Strong boys next to strong girls, so I know it wasn‚Äôt an admiration as a result of a power imbalance. I wasn‚Äôt attracted to them, so much as I wanted to be them. I would ask my parents to call me male names. In a good mood, they would oblige. It always made me feel euphoric; I‚Äôve always hated my female name, and most non-gender neutral or non-male names. I‚Äôve never identified with my given name. Fast forward, in elementary school I have very vivid memories of wishing to use the restroom as boys did, up to sitting backwards. This resulted in a lot of embarrassment for me, at the time I didn‚Äôt have the words as to why, but I can now identify that I was overcome with frustration with how I was anatomically. I hated my breasts and what‚Äôs between my legs; sex wasn‚Äôt appealing and scared me, because I didn‚Äôt want to be able to bear a child.

I had unhealthy relationships with boys and girls my same age; looking back, what I think was assumed attraction to men was actually jealousy, that they could be this way I desired, that they could have the attention from whom I desired. I grew up extremely evangelical; every source of media I consumed was Biblical, but Man‚Äôs interpretation, if you understand. My cousin was shunned from our community; my sister basically stood trial for depression and an eating disorder, had her integrity questioned in front of the congregation by elders while she was in the hospital. Everything I was taught was caustic; everything was brimstone. Because of this, I became emotionally and sexually reclusive. Sex scared me. I scared me. Everything resulted in Hell except prayer. Can you feel that anxiety? I wore it for over 20 years.

My first year of college, I met someone who was ftm, online. They became a close friend. They resonated with me, I shared things with them, until they scared me. Because I was 18, and everything I knew still resulted in Hell. I was getting too close to the flame; it felt like I wasn‚Äôt allowed to know myself. Because maybe I‚Äôve always known myself.

I‚Äôm in a heterosexual marriage now. I know I‚Äôm definitely pansexual. Things happened quickly, anxiously, because in Evangelical communities it‚Äôs almost like everyone is in competition to establish they are the most straight of all the straights in all the land. It was at warp-speed so I could protect myself. He‚Äôs loving, and considerate. We‚Äôve been married three years. He‚Äôs my best friend, but it‚Äôs a relationship that started in that broody, familiar, I‚Äôm-so-jealous-of-you ways. I married who I was jealous of. I steal his clothes when he‚Äôs not home, and still loathe my body. Not in a dysmorphic way, but with complete dysphoria. I don‚Äôt feel like who I am, and I feel stuck in a parallel universe. I want to be with my husband... as his devoted best friend. That he talks about women with... that I talk about whomever with. Before it gets brought up, yes, I do have an LGBTQ+ counselor. And yes, my husband knows...now. But I have a horrendously hard time verbalizing it to him. How can this person he‚Äôs known 7 years, not at all be the person he‚Äôs known?

I only confronted my anxiety two years ago, after my third suicide encounter. That was a tipping point. And it feels like the more I tackle my anxiety, the more I‚Äôm discovering who I never would allow myself to venture to be. And it‚Äôs freeing but mortifying at the same time. My parents have relaxed a bit about their faith, and my abandonment of the church out of fear has led me to find a faith of my own. This has brought a little bit of relief. But at times I find myself jealous of young kids and teens, who grew up with at least possibly affirming classmates and online communities. We had three openly gay classmates at my high school. Two committed suicide. There was no Tumblr, maybe a baby Reddit, a fledgling Twitter. Forget about affirming and supportive places like Instagram. It just didn‚Äôt exist. I also know that the existence of these platforms don‚Äôt actually make it easier for youth, and often make existence feel even more competitive; my heart hurts for them, because I know that I do at least have the privilege of perspective distance because of my age. But I‚Äôve started to look back on so much of my life as just expansive, dark, frightening years. I was so, so scared of myself. And now that I‚Äôm less scared of myself, I‚Äôm so, so scared of what that brings.

I don‚Äôt feel like this could fit much of anywhere in other forums, and I‚Äôm sorry if this violates a community standard. But I‚Äôm processing everything so rapidly, and profoundly, that I just needed to put it somewhere other than a journal. It can just sit here, really, and breathe. Because at least I said it.

As a primer, I am AFAB and in my mid-30s. When I was young being genderqueer or transgender wasn‚Äôt even in the conversation. I knew what ‚Äúgay‚Äù was primarily because it was talked about in school, usually framed as a bad thing. Ironically even though my first romantic and sexual experiences were with femmefolk it didn‚Äôt even occur to me that I might be gay because hey, mascfolk could also be hot (being bi/pansexual wasn‚Äôt a term used at all when I was young)? 

I feel society underestimates how *powerful* having the language to describe your inner experiences is. Especially when it falls outside the norm. I haven‚Äôt had the language. I am developing it with time. After lurking a bit I thought this community would be great for continuing my education and help me work out what is confusing for me, still.

It hit me like a lightning bolt when someone kind pulled me aside and explained that a lot of my dysphoria and self-hatred could be coming from a place of being genderqueer. Now I *know* I am genderqueer but am still feeling conflicted and confused as f\*\*k.

My personal experiences as summarized as follows:

Childhood:

* Did not feel like a girl. Acted boyish and felt deep discomfort and sadness when people would call me a ‚Äútomboy.‚Äù  
 I didn‚Äôt feel like a girl or a boy but felt more comfortable with traditionally masculine/boyish roles (hated pink/dolls, was rough and tumble outdoorsy, etc.). If anyone would have asked me as a kid I would have said I'd was a boy or preferred to be a boy because the gender roles more closely matched there.
* Was forced to keep hair certain way and dress a certain way by parents because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù enough. It hurt a lot and led to a lot of depression due to never expressing my true self. My true self generally dismissed by family and ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù
* Did not have any physical dysphoria until puberty hit, then started having severe dysphoria and even depersonalization events.
* Childhood was complicated by numerous childhood traumas (have a diagnosis of cPTSD and PTSD).

Adulthood:

* Sometimes have trouble recognizing my own face in the mirror (from an emotional standpoint). This gets easier when I dress more masculine/androgynous.
* It feels like I am crossdressing or wearing a costume when I wear a dress, for example.
* Have fantasies I have male genitalia, but also of female genitals (just not as often).
* Felt disgust/dysphoria with my female body during sex with previous partners, but it feels good with my current partner to be female in bed (who is AMAB and cis/het).
* Started taking a low dose of testosterone for an unrelated chronic illness and it felt like something ‚Äúclicked‚Äù inside. It felt great. But I am not sure if that‚Äôs because it helped my chronic illness AND/OR the gender stuff. Considering pursuing a dose of T that would not be at transitioning-level but something higher than what I have.
* Feel discomfort at female pronouns, feel the rightness when gender-neutral pronouns are used. If someone accidentally calls me ‚Äúsir‚Äù it does not feel bad like someone calling me ‚Äúma‚Äôam.‚Äù
* Got a packer to see how that would feel and it felt good but was not mind-blowing. 
* Gaining weight (I am overweight now) increases by dysphoria in part because it increases my curves.
* I feel a lot of envy for people who can pass as androgynous more than I do for masculine men.
* EVERYTHING is complicated by the fact that I also have a severe (potentially life threatening) chronic illness.

So, what language describes these experiences in YOUR understanding?

I also question whether I could be transgendered but keep landing more on agendered with a propensity to me more comfortable *presenting* on the masculine end of the spectrum (butch agender?). Is that even a thing? Or is that just being transgendered?  

But I am often dismissed when I state I am genderqueer in this respect because I am extremely curvy and not androgynous at all in my physical body. It does not matter how I try and present myself, I get told I am a woman and there is no question. I don‚Äôt feel like a woman. I don‚Äôt even know what feeling like a woman feels like though, because I‚Äôve never had a feeling like that? I‚Äôve just assumed being a woman WAS that body discomfort/dysphoria, but I‚Äôve been talking to my cis friends about this and apparently their experiences of their own bodies are VERY different than mine.

My initial forays into telling my small world I am genderqueer have been mixed. Friends say it is ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù to remember using neutral pronouns. Many freaked out when I changed my name on my social media. My partner of 13 years has been very supportive, luckily. I would lose him as a romantic partner if I ever choose to physically transition. And right now that does not feel like something I want to do though I admit I fantasize about not having this near-constant dysphoria about my body and wonder if being a man would ‚Äúfix‚Äù that. 

I also have the feeling that if society would just stop being such a general asshole about all this I would be much more comfortable as I am. Non-gendered.

I'm an AFAB nonbinary lesbian. My gender is something like... Agender, mostly, but I don't mind ""siding with the girls"" in a general sense and never have. I do consider myself to be partially a girl - but not a woman, because that word feels ""too"" gendered. Before you ask, yes, I am an adult. I guess you could call me a demigirl as a quick approximation. I've also described my gender as something like 5% female, 95% nothing (with some slight variance), or simply ""nonbinary lesbian"". For the record, I am 0% male and have never had any doubts about that fact.


When it comes to body dysphoria that is specifically related to gender, I... don't really feel it often? When I do feel it, it's always due to outside influence, and never because I feel like my body is inherently ""wrong"". Basically, I don't mind having breasts and a vulva and periods because of any inherent feeling of wrongness. They feel fine! (Except periods, GOD, fuck periods, delete them forever. But even then, it's just that I find periods annoying, not that I find them dysphoria-inducing in and of themselves.)

I only feel gender dysphoria when I am gendered specifically based on the appearance of my body. If a person sees me and thinks ""oh, that person has breasts and therefore is a woman""? No thank you, I hate that. ""Periods are a symbol of womanhood and femaleness""? Kindly fuck off with that cissexist crap. Amusingly, when I encounter cissexist bullshit in the wild, I tend to suddenly feel a hell of a lot more agender for a bit.

If anything, any ""actual"" dysphoria that I feel (by which I mean, in my case, the feeling that my body in and of itself is *wrong*) is more of a ""whole body"" thing? Sometimes I just don't want to have a body, period. Which is a bit unusual, I'll give you that. It's less about ""being perceived as a woman"" and more about ""this flesh suit is feeling awfully uncomfortable right now.""


That was just an intro. This next part will go into explicit sex discussions, so tread carefully. Be aware that I may possibly be saying transmisogynistic things as well. (I don't *think* I am, but...?)

Anyway... as a lesbian, I am obviously into women, whether they be cis, trans, or nonbinary. Assuming I'm into a particular lady and that lady is into me, I would be totally down to have sex with her, genitals being irrelevant.

But here's the thing: I DO have a genital preference!¬†‚Ä¶ For penises. I don't at all dislike or mind vulvas! I think they're just fine. I just think penises are nice, you know? Specifically, PIV sex sounds super appealing in a way that something like, say, strap-on sex doesn't. There's something about how both partners are feeling pleasure directly from the sex act rather than from ""just"" enjoying performing it. Like, I would love for my partner to have strap-on sex with me, but it wouldn't exactly stimulate her fun bits in a direct way, which is what I'm especially interested in: that reciprocity, the one act giving both partners direct stimulation, simultaneously. I hope that makes sense?

Except well, obviously, a vast majority of women who have dicks are trans women. So this puts me in a kind of weird situation where I'm worried I might be fetishizing trans women. Three quick disclaimers:

- I am fully aware that not all trans women have penises.
- I also know that many trans women who do have penises are very uncomfortable with using them for penetrative sex, and I in NO way would pressure them into such a thing.
- I am in an exclusive, happy relationship with a cis woman and have never and will never seek out other women to have sex with without my girlfriend's explicit permission, so at this time there is no chance of me ever actually going out there and courting ladies. We are strictly in ""potential thoughtcrime"" territory.

And here comes the second part that makes me worried I'm fetishizing trans ladies. I would like to have a dick, but only for sex purposes, NOT for anything gender related. As I said, I feel no ""direct"" dysphoria from having a vulva; my genitals are completely and utterly unrelated to my gender. They're just there for peeing and sex, as far as I'm concerned.

My ideal body would be one where I can just... change everything at will? For example, I would love to be able to change the size of my breasts whenever. Going out? Boom, flat chest! Sexy times? Make 'em bigger, baby! And I'd love to have a dick sometimes (while leaving my vulva intact so I'd have both ""sets"" of genitals, sans the testicles) but only for sex as well.

Obviously, this isn't actionable. It's not like I can go get a phalloplasty or surgery to change my breast size on a whim. So I HIGHLY doubt I'll ever do anything to alter my body in any significant way. It's just‚Ä¶ something I'd like, you know? Sometimes I get sad that I'll never be able to experience PIV sex from the ""giving"" end. And it's unlikely that I would ever experience it on the ""receiving"" end, either (assuming my current relationship works out, as I certainly hope it will, and assuming we stay exclusive, which we probably will, but who even knows?).


TL;DR &amp; questions: I'm an AFAB nonbinary lesbian who mostly doesn't feel any gender dysphoria without outside influence (AKA cis people being cissexist). I would love to be able to ""put on"" and ""take off"" a penis at will for penetrative sex, and I would love to be on the receiving end of ""direct"" penetrative sex (AKA with a penis, not a strap-on/dildo) from a woman as well. I worry that I'm being creepy and fetishizing trans women. Am I? Can anyone relate to this experience?",genderqueer,"AFAB NB lesbian here.

My gender is something like... Agender, mostly, but I don\'t mind ""siding with the girls"" in a general sense and never have. I do consider myself to be partially a girl - but not a woman, because that word feels ""too"" gendered. Before you ask, yes, I am an adult. I guess you could call me a demigirl as a quick approximation. I\'ve also described my gender as something like 5% female, 95% nothing (with some slight variance), or simply ""nonbinary lesbian"". For the record, I am 0% male and have never had any doubts about that fact.\n\n\nWhen it comes to body dysphoria that is specifically related to gender, I... don\'t really feel it often? When I do feel it, it\'s always due to outside influence, and never because I feel like my body is inherently ""wrong"". Basically, I don\'t mind having breasts and a vulva and periods because of any inherent feeling of wrongness. They feel fine! (Except periods, GOD, fuck periods, delete them forever. But even then, it\'s just that I find periods annoying, not that I find them dysphoria-inducing in and of themselves.)\n\nI only feel gender dysphoria when I am gendered specifically based on the appearance of my body. If a person sees me and thinks ""oh, that person has breasts and therefore is a woman""? No thank you, I hate that. ""Periods are a symbol of womanhood and femaleness""? Kindly fuck off with that cissexist crap. Amusingly, when I encounter cissexist bullshit in the wild, I tend to suddenly feel a hell of a lot more agender for a bit.\n\nIf anything, any ""actual"" dysphoria that I feel (by which I mean, in my case, the feeling that my body in and of itself is *wrong*) is more of a ""whole body"" thing? Sometimes I just don\'t want to have a body, period. Which is a bit unusual, I\'ll give you that. It\'s less about ""being perceived as a woman"" and more about ""this flesh suit is feeling awfully uncomfortable right now.""\n\n\nThat was just an intro. This next part will go into explicit sex discussions, so tread carefully. Be aware that I may possibly be saying transmisogynistic things as well. (I don\'t *think* I am, but...?)\n\nAnyway... as a lesbian, I am obviously into women, whether they be cis, trans, or nonbinary. Assuming I\'m into a particular lady and that lady is into me, I would be totally down to have sex with her, genitals being irrelevant.\n\nBut here\'s the thing: I DO have a genital preference!\xa0‚Ä¶ For penises. I don\'t at all dislike or mind vulvas! I think they\'re just fine. I just think penises are nice, you know? Specifically, PIV sex sounds super appealing in a way that something like, say, strap-on sex doesn\'t. There\'s something about how both partners are feeling pleasure directly from the sex act rather than from ""just"" enjoying performing it. Like, I would love for my partner to have strap-on sex with me, but it wouldn\'t exactly stimulate her fun bits in a direct way, which is what I\'m especially interested in: that reciprocity, the one act giving both partners direct stimulation, simultaneously.

128,2019-10-24 00:51:09,dm8udz,0,1,"So, here's my obligatory mention that this is a second account. I just created it five minutes ago because I have questions. Lots and lots of questions. Questions so pressing that I didn't even verify my email because I wanted to get them out. So, let's start the saga.

 So, I started questioning in August of 2019. I read as much as I could about being gender non-conforming, a lot of it was bullshit and very little of it was valid. The problem is, I found an identity for myself among the bullshit I was reading, but I feel like I can't talk about it or do anything to make myself feel good without facing judgment, which is something that on some levels I am cripplingly afraid of. I'm weird like that; I can wear a blinged-out dog collar and not give a shit, but the moment you put me in a situation where I might have to explain to someone that I don't know what I identify as, I start freaking out. The problem is, I can identify with objects and concepts. 

 Now, let me explain what I mean by 'objects and concepts'. What I mean is, I feel like my soul hums in the same frequency as those objects or concepts for a certain amount of time. It sounds weird, and I'm sure there's a better way to phrase it, but I can't think of any. What I feel, I want to express. I want to dress a certain way and act a certain way, but I'm so afraid that I'll be told I'm not supposed to be this way, that I shouldn't be this way, that I don't. I just act like what people think I should act like. 

 One example is my mannerisms. When I'm alone and I identify with, for example, glitter, I'll be walking on the balls of my feet, twirling and dancing if I feel like it, and I like to eat sweet foods and I like shiny things. Maybe I don't want to talk, and that's okay. When I'm alone and I feel like I'm more in tune with the word 'dizzy' I'll be laughing and talking to myself, walking weird on purpose, giggling, drumming my fingers. When I'm with other people, it kind of just becomes 'bleh'. I just act the same, I don't do anything different, and it hurts me. I just want to express myself, but I'm terrified. I don't want to be the one who gets put in the psych ward because I lost my marbles.

 Another problem for me is my pronouns. I prefer to be called she/her pronouns, and I feel guilty about that. I'm AFAB, so I wonder, 'what if this is a phase?', 'what if I'm not actually this?'. I hate it so much, but I don't like being called they or he or any other pronouns, just she/her. 

 That's all I can think of to tell you before I get into my questions. If I think of any more questions, I might make a second post, but for now, here are the questions I can remember:

143,2019-10-27 03:33:26,dno6un,6,5,"Hi all! 

I've been trying to figure myself out a bit recently and find a specific way that I can refer to my gender identity, and I'm wondering if you might be able to help. I've known for a looooong time that I'm not totally cis, and I've existed fairly happily in the kinda gender-fluid middle ground for a while but I've never really been able to actually put on a label on my gender identity. That gender identity is actually quite stable these days, and I'm at the point now where I actually *want* a label, and want to be able to define myself. Here's where y'all come in, hopefully!

Cue the lengthy life story (oh lawd)

I'm in my late 20s. I was born female, but there has been no significant period in my life when I have conformed to the gender identity of 'woman'. I use she/her pronouns because it makes things easier for other people. 

As a child, I had no strong connection to being a 'girl' and was pretty much as un-girly as it was possible to get. My best friends were boys, my favourite games and pastimes were traditionally 'boy stuff' - getting dirty, rough and tumble, boys toys, etc. I didn't connect very well with girls. Classic tomboy. I have a very feminine name, but when I was about 10, I went through a phase of asking people to call me 'Sam'. I gave up because no-one would.

As a teenager, it was much the same. I was sent to an all-girls school but spent my life wishing I could go to my brother's (all-boys) school. I got into rock music, nerdy shit, skateboarding, James Bond movies and martial arts. I had a glorious teenage rebellion, buzzed my hair off, refused to shave my legs even though my school uniform had a compulsory skirt, and moved on to baggy jeans and polo shirts as soon as I went to college. Again, classic tomboy. I realised that I was bisexual, which was a start towards understanding my gender/sexuality, but trans issues and gender identity weren't a 'well known thing' back then (we're talking early-2000s here) so while I went through phases of wondering if I was just the typical butch lesbian, I never thought my gender was up for question. I was a girl, even if I never felt like one.

As an adult, I'm still the same: I work in a traditionally male profession, most of my closest friends are guys, my interests are typically 'blokey', but I present myself differently. I'm quite insecure about my looks and the fact that I'm on the larger side of average size, so if I want to impress, I dress to flatter my (curvy, girly) figure... which ultimately means dressing feminine. I wear what looks best on me. Dresses and skirts and heels are still Not My Thing but I usually tend towards 'fierce and feminine' - stompy masculine boots paired with tight jeans and feminine low cut tops. My hair is long, and if I'm dressing to impress, I wear a lot of makeup (because dammit, I'm good at it, haha). Why? Because it's flattering. Because it looks good. Because I have cheekbones and hips and boobs and a decent arse and that's how I can best make that figure look good. 

Yet I am constantly aware that my outward appearance does not represent the 'me' that's in my head. It's like putting on a costume. The 'girl' costume looks better on me than the 'boy' one, so I always go for it. It's easier. It's the path of least resistance. It's a compromise, one which is designed to make the most of what I've got. If I'm not dressing to impress, I'll have my hair perpetually tied up, no makeup, comfortable clothes, practical boots, don't give a shit.

I work out hard and train with weights to build muscle: that's also a compromise. I have always struggled with shifting the extra weight, so if my figure's going to be curvy and feminine, I also want it to be strong and fierce.

If I had a slimmer, more androgynous figure, I'd buzz my hair off again in a heartbeat. I'd rarely wear makeup (because tbh it's a hassle). I'd probably return to the baggy jeans and polo shirts of my teenage years. I'd wear a suit to a wedding instead of a dress. I'd eliminate most traces of femininity from my looks, and I'd be comfortable with that. 

Despite the way I present myself these days, I don't feel like a woman. Ever since I was a kid, my heroes, the famous figures or fictional characters who I've looked at and gone ""damn, I want to be them/look like them""... have always been men. All my closest friends have always been men. I've always felt like, and wanted to be considered as, 'one of the guys'. I know, deep down, through a lot of introspection, that my identity is way way closer to the male end of the spectrum than the female end, yet I'm stuck in this weird situation where I'm presenting as (quite strongly) feminine because that's what looks good on me.

That said, I'm pretty certain I'm not legitimately trans? I have no dysphoria with regards to my body other than its overall size: my boobs are small and easy to ignore, I recognise my arse and hips as an 'attractive feature', and although I would absolutely not mind if I woke up tomorrow with a penis and a flat chest instead, I'm fine with my body the way it is - even if I do wish it was a little smaller so I could convincingly dress it in more masculine clothes and present as more androgynous. If I had the option of transitioning, I don't think I'd take it: I don't want to lose the possibility of presenting as female (like I said earlier, it's nice to play dress-up), but I do wish my shape was less overtly feminine. And I would very, very much love to go by an androgynous or male name, even it's totally out of step with the way I present myself. *Especially* if it's totally out of step with the way I present myself. I've picked one, and I'd love to use it. The concept of outwardly presenting female but using man's name is ridiculously attractive to me, for some reason.

So yes. That's me. Boy brain, girl body, presents as a girl, would actually rather be somewhere firmly and un-distinguishably in the middle. What on earth do I call that? Can I have a label please?

Help me finally figure out my gender identity?,1572172406.0,"{'created_utc': 1572147206, 'id': 'dno6un', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Hi all! \n\nI\'ve been trying to figure myself out a bit recently and find a specific way that I can refer to my gender identity, and I\'m wondering if you might be able to help. I\'ve known for a looooong time that I\'m not totally cis, and I\'ve existed fairly happily in the kinda gender-fluid middle ground for a while but I\'ve never really been able to actually put on a label on my gender identity. That gender identity is actually quite stable these days, and I\'m at the point now where I actually *want* a label, and want to be able to define myself. Here\'s where y\'all come in, hopefully!\n\nCue the lengthy life story (oh lawd)\n\nI\'m in my late 20s. I was born female, but there has been no significant period in my life when I have conformed to the gender identity of \'woman\'. I use she/her pronouns because it makes things easier for other people. \n\nAs a child, I had no strong connection to being a \'girl\' and was pretty much as un-girly as it was possible to get. My best friends were boys, my favourite games and pastimes were traditionally \'boy stuff\' - getting dirty, rough and tumble, boys toys, etc. I didn\'t connect very well with girls. Classic tomboy. I have a very feminine name, but when I was about 10, I went through a phase of asking people to call me \'Sam\'. I gave up because no-one would.\n\nAs a teenager, it was much the same. I was sent to an all-girls school but spent my life wishing I could go to my brother\'s (all-boys) school. I got into rock music, nerdy shit, skateboarding, James Bond movies and martial arts. I had a glorious teenage rebellion, buzzed my hair off, refused to shave my legs even though my school uniform had a compulsory skirt, and moved on to baggy jeans and polo shirts as soon as I went to college. Again, classic tomboy. I realised that I was bisexual, which was a start towards understanding my gender/sexuality, but trans issues and gender identity weren\'t a \'well known thing\' back then (we\'re talking early-2000s here) so while I went through phases of wondering if I was just the typical butch lesbian, I never thought my gender was up for question. I was a girl, even if I never felt like one.\n\nAs an adult, I\'m still the same: I work in a traditionally male profession, most of my closest friends are guys, my interests are typically \'blokey\', but I present myself differently. I\'m quite insecure about my looks and the fact that I\'m on the larger side of average size, so if I want to impress, I dress to flatter my (curvy, girly) figure... which ultimately means dressing feminine. I wear what looks best on me. Dresses and skirts and heels are still Not My Thing but I usually tend towards \'fierce and feminine\' - stompy masculine boots paired with tight jeans and feminine low cut tops. My hair is long, and if I\'m dressing to impress, I wear a lot of makeup (because dammit, I\'m good at it, haha). Why? Because it\'s flattering. Because it looks good. Because I have cheekbones and hips and boobs and a decent arse and that\'s how I can best make that figure look good. \n\nYet I am constantly aware that my outward appearance does not represent the \'me\' that\'s in my head. It\'s like putting on a costume. The \'girl\' costume looks better on me than the \'boy\' one, so I always go for it. It\'s easier. It\'s the path of least resistance. It\'s a compromise, one which is designed to make the most of what I\'ve got. If I\'m not dressing to impress, I\'ll have my hair perpetually tied up, no makeup, comfortable clothes, practical boots, don\'t give a shit.\n\nI work out hard and train with weights to build muscle: that\'s also a compromise. I have always struggled with shifting the extra weight, so if my figure\'s going to be curvy and feminine, I also want it to be strong and fierce.\n\nIf I had a slimmer, more androgynous figure, I\'d buzz my hair off again in a heartbeat. I\'d rarely wear makeup (because tbh it\'s a hassle). I\'d probably return to the baggy jeans and polo shirts of my teenage years. I\'d wear a suit to a wedding instead of a dress. I\'d eliminate most traces of femininity from my looks, and I\'d be comfortable with that. \n\nDespite the way I present myself these days, I don\'t feel like a woman. Ever since I was a kid, my heroes, the famous figures or fictional characters who I\'ve looked at and gone ""damn, I want to be them/look like them""... have always been men. All my closest friends have always been men. I\'ve always felt like, and wanted to be considered as, \'one of the guys\'.

156,2019-10-28 20:43:54,dof149,4,28,"This is slightly modified from a post I made to r/asktransgender a bit over a week ago, which was the update to an older post. I've been pondering the possibility of being trans for a while, and capital-Q questioning for just a month and change. 

For backstory, I'm 16, AFAB, and have recently been starting to think I might not be cis. I got a few comments on my original post saying my symptoms didn't sound like binary dysphoria, and I agree. If I'm not cis, then I'm likely not completely a binary trans boy.

My main problem right now is that my feelings fluctuate so often that I'm not sure whether they're Trans Things or regular insecurities. My gender feelings will fluctuate anywhere from every few days to multiple times a day. Sometimes I have days like today where I'm longing to have all the masc traits I'm about to list, and then days where I'm not really bothered by it and I'm fine being a (not very femme) female. So my biggest fear is coming to some sort of conclusion, cis or otherwise, and then being wrong about it.

When I'm feeling masc, I don't want to pass completely as male, and I wouldn't want to be a straight guy (I only like girls) but I'd like to be androgynous/male-leaning. I don't feel like I fit in well with large communities of girls or guys. I really want a lower voice and I want a male figure with broader shoulders, flat chest, a straighter body- but I don't want a penis, or tons facial hair. (Maybe a bit is fine.) If my egg cracked, I'd be interested in going on T, just probably a lower dose. Bottom line is, I'd like for people to not be able to immediately tell my gender, but upon guessing, go with male.

As I mentioned earlier, this is over-complicated by not knowing whether my feelings are trans things or regular insecurities. For example, am I more or less okay with my body (depending on the day) because I'm fine with it being a female body, or because it's already very androgynous and straight? I feel like if I had a more feminine figure, I'd be very uncomfortable with it, but in this middle zone, I never know whether I feel body dysphoria, or to what extent.

Pronouns are weird for me because personally, even though I don't feel binary, they/them doesn't feel right on me. When I'm feeling masc, I like the pronouns he/him, although the prospect is new and scary. On the other hand, I don't have strong feelings against she/her, just put off a little bit, like it's a grammar error. I feel weird about she/her, but I'm not sure if I actually dislike it or if I'm overthinking and making myself think I don't like it so I can have more """"evidence"""". *(Sounds sketch, but more on that later.)* And he/him is the same way but in the other direction. When I picture one of my friends calling me ""he"", I like it, but I can't tell if that's euphoria or nerves from trying out something new.

*(This is the ""more on that later"" part.)* If I had a definitive realization that I'm trans, it'd be terrifying, but it'd also be relieving in a way because it'd feel like I have an explanation for why I'm like this. So I'm worried that my internal bias is making me reconsider things I feel okay with so I can have more """"evidence"""" for being trans. 

**\[Possible TW for what I think is internalized transphobia- my insecurities about enbies and the dating pool. Sorry, I really don't know how to word this so it sounds good. You don't have to read it.\]**

&gt;!If I transitioned, years down the road, I feel like my dating prospects would be significantly decreased. How would I find a girl who wants to date an enby? I don't think I'd be a binary trans dude, and I wouldn't be interested in bottom surgery, so how many girls would be interested in that? And I guess this next part is even more TMI and incorrect, but I wouldn't want to take on the dominant/traditionally male role in a relationship. Sorry again, I know this is probably incorrect and all kinds of offensive, but I worry about it.!&lt;

Here are some other eggy moments I've compiled.

* Browse r/ftm, r/egg_irl, and r/asktransgender regularly
* Watch FTM transition compilation YouTube videos regularly, but not MTF ones
* Research boy names A LOT, and always have a favorite on hand that I think fits me
* Daydream about what it‚Äôd be like to be trans, and to live as a boy
* Daydream about getting a foster kid or younger sibling who comes out as a trans boy, and helping them come out/transition
* Watched that entire video on nb top surgery
* Draw myself as a guy/androgynous a lot, and make guy/androgynous avatars a lot
* Venture into men‚Äôs sections a lot
* Before I was questioning, I tried on girls' Nike Pros, and got the S instead of XS because they looked more like boxers
* Wish I could be flat chested/shirtless at pool
* Got SUPER excited about reading this one book where neither protagonists is referred to with any gender markers or pronouns, then VERY disappointed when it was boring
* Bought a memoir by a *binary* trans man to figure out if I was trans, then when I didn‚Äôt fully relate to his experiences, completely discarded the idea of being trans until I came back to it a week later
* Had a freak-out in a department store dressing room trying on a homecoming dress because my (A-cup) chest looked too big and I looked too feminine, then had to take the dress off and calm myself down by thinking about transitioning, even though I hadn't even started questioning yet

Could I get some advice? Do these signs point to me being cis, insecure, and just gnc/androgynous, or maybe trans/nb?

One last thing- I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about pronouns. Even if you don't have any advice to give, could you maybe humor me by writing a sentence or so addressing me in the comments? You can use the pronouns she/her if your birthday falls in Jan-April, they/them if it falls in May-Aug, and he/him if it falls in Sept-Dec. You can also use the name Jack.

But the more I search the more confused I get. 

I'm not very traditionally feminine, I don't like makeup and I love my body hair for example. Sometimes I think it'd be nice if I could grow a beard. But overall I do feel comfortable being a woman and people seeing me as a woman.

However, last week, while falling asleep, I had what I thought was an intrusive thought. ‚ÄúI want to be sexy, like a girl though.‚Äù Ok, weird, whatever it happens sometimes. The whole next day, however, it was all I could think about. I kinda did want that. But at the same time, I was comfortable being male, with my body and my pronouns. 

I began to grow terrified that I was trans. I don‚Äôt have anything against trans people but I desperately did not want to be trans. Whether it was fear or internalized transphobia, I didn‚Äôt. are.

As I did research, I came across things like the idea of gender dysphoria. I realized I can‚Äôt be trans because I don‚Äôt hate my body. I‚Äôm proud of how I‚Äôm fairly fit, decent abs, etc. I don‚Äôt mentally feel like a girl all the time and I don‚Äôt want to dress, act and look like one all the time. 

I then discovered gender fluid and realized it fit me. I fluctuate, and whether its very small things like acting slightly feminine or slightly masculine sometimes, or bigger things, like wanting to appear super masculine or super feminine. 

Now I‚Äôm still not completely sure how I feel about this. I don‚Äôt know if there is another  ‚Äòlabel‚Äô that fits me better, or if its just a weird hormonal driven phase kinda thing. Regardless, I am comfortable with this at the moment. I will probably always present male, because thats what I feel more comfortable with in public, and I‚Äôm not a fan of makeup, longer hair, etc. 

My biggest problem is, what now? When I feel like I am female, what do I do with my masculine body? I don‚Äôt want to like, get surgery and change and all that, partly because I would be disowned by my father who I love, and partly because I‚Äôll def regret it when I feel like a male.

Whether it was fear or internalized transphobia, I didn‚Äôt. are.\n\nAs I did research, I came across things like the idea of gender dysphoria. I realized I can‚Äôt be trans because I don‚Äôt hate my body. I‚Äôm proud of how I‚Äôm fairly fit, decent abs, etc. I don‚Äôt mentally feel like a girl all the time and I don‚Äôt want to dress, act and look like one all the time. \n\nI then discovered gender fluid and realized it fit me. I fluctuate, and whether its very small things like acting slightly feminine or slightly masculine sometimes, or bigger things, like wanting to appear super masculine or super feminine. \n\nNow I‚Äôm still not completely sure how I feel about this. I don‚Äôt know if there is another  ‚Äòlabel‚Äô that fits me better, or if its just a weird hormonal driven phase kinda thing. Regardless, I am comfortable with this at the moment. I will probably always present male, because thats what I feel more comfortable with in public, and I‚Äôm not a fan of makeup, longer hair, etc. \n\nMy biggest problem is, what now? When I feel like I am female, what do I do with my masculine body? I don‚Äôt want to like, get surgery and change and all that, partly because I would be disowned by my father who I love, and partly because I‚Äôll def regret it when I feel like a male. I‚Äôm just struggling with understand how to deal with this. Any help is appreciated.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'i think i figured it out. im genderfluid!', 'created': 1570281941.0}"

78,2019-10-09 10:48:08,dffadu,3,3,"(I'm on mobile and english is not my 1st language, so I'm sorry if I write smt wrong)

Its been a while since I started considering the idea that I'm genderfluid and I'm feeling very confused right now. 

I spent a week flowing between nb and boy and I realized it wasn't the first time that it happened in my life. I felt truely disphoric about my hips and breasts and it was kinda uncomfortable. I also feel like I never identifyed entirely as a girl 100% of time, but most times I'm a girl, and a very feminine one. I see gender fluid people skiping from girl to boy to none to both in a week, and I feel weird identifying like this just because I dont feel female a few times in a year.

I'm pretty confused and scared. A part of me says its just a phase because I'm reading a lot about it on Twitter and wanted attention. I'm surrounded by people that love me and want to help me, but are also much confused about all of this. I know my girlfriend (a very butch lesbian) sees me as a girl and, at start, she thought gender fuid was a personality disorder, but its not because she doesn't love me and don't want to help.

I'm very scared of figuring out I'm like this and having to explain to everyone. I'm going to college next year and I can't even imagine wgat people will say about it.

I felt truely disphoric about my hips and breasts and it was kinda uncomfortable. I also feel like I never identifyed entirely as a girl 100% of time, but most times I'm a girl, and a very feminine one. I see gender fluid people skiping from girl to boy to none to both in a week, and I feel weird identifying like this just because I dont feel female a few times in a year.\n\nI'm pretty confused and scared. A part of me says its just a phase because I'm reading a lot about it on Twitter and wanted attention. I'm surrounded by people that love me and want to help me, but are also much confused about all of this. I know my girlfriend (a very butch lesbian) sees me as a girl and, at start, she thought gender fuid was a personality disorder, but its not because she doesn't love me and don't want to help.\n\nI'm very scared of figuring out I'm like this and having to explain to everyone.

Are you a parent or prospective parent? Do you identify as non-binary, gender-nonconforming, genderqueer, and/or gender fluid? If so, you might be able to participate in a paid Harvard study examining the experiences of GNC parents. Confidentiality is guaranteed, and $20/hr compensation is provided for a casual interview.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals navigate their parent identity, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or cis gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.

So last night, my brother had a friend over for dinner.  It was kind of unexpected, but fortunately I made a big enough dish for all of us.  I met the guy once or twice I think but I don't know many of my brother's friends very well.  For the most part, the dinner was pretty nice.  It was interesting hearing him talking about his job and the career he wants in the future.  We had fun laughing at stupid jokes and such, it was nice.  But then he started joking about something about how doctors can't assign gender to babies and only the baby themselves can when they can't even talk and my brother started joining in on it.  

Now, to be clear, I am not out to my brother or my mom (the only people who know irl is my oldest sister and her husband), so my brother would have no way of knowing that was kind of hurtful to me.  I have dropped some subtle hints to him and my irl friends, but sadly I'm too good at subtlety.  I know my brother would never intentionally try to hurt me because he knows I can be sensitive, but even then, he knows there are transgender people I follow online, and he knows I very much support it.  As for his friend, again, he doesn't really know me so I seriously doubt he would intentionally be trying to hurt me as well.  He seemed like a really fun and chill guy but even in a joking sense that just came off as incredibly insensitive to me.  And worse, it all but reinforced the thought in my head that I can never tell my brother about me.  He's always been iffy about trans people and he's still not on board with gay or bi people.  He follows an older mindset about how life is supposed to be instead of opening himself up to the idea of alternatives.  It just kills me inside that I feel I can never tell my brother, my closest sibling that I grew up with, one of the most important things about myself to him because he'll either never understand or won't accept it and, even more fearful, he'll reject me.  I'm already afraid we've drifted apart enough as is despite the fact we live in the same house but if I lose him completely because of something I can't control and he's too stubborn to understand or accept it, I couldn't live with that.  The rest of my family all have their own lives, my brother and my mom are basically the only family I really have.  If I were to lose either of them over this, I wouldn't be able to bear it.  I do think my brother knew I was upset over the joke because I stopped laughing at that point, and fortunately the conversation went back to jokey jokes and it ended up being a nice dinner but that part still left me feeling upset.

I‚Äôve come out to three of my friends successfully without getting any hate. Well kind of, my last friend was kind of weird about it so yeah. But there‚Äôs just stuff like r/Thereareonly2genders and ‚ÄúNon binary and Genderfluid cringe comps üò±ü§°‚Äù that really scare me. I know I live in a fairly safe country but I sometimes just want to disappear. 

I was in my horrible english class ( I usually love english class but somehow this teacher has managed to make me hate it) and i was writing down name ideas since I‚Äôve been thinking about changing to a more gender neutral name (I change between female and male and go by both he/his/him and her/she/hers pronouns like at the same time) Anyways I had to keep flipping over my page whenever the teacher walked over to look like I was doing work. I was scared that she‚Äôd do that thing where they snatch your note or whatever and read it out to the whole class since she already threatened on a group of girls earlier that class. 

Almost a year ago now my dad went to a conference about being lgbtq+ in the work place and fighting against discrimination in the well work place. They gave them these tags where they would write out their full name and what pronoun(s) they go as. My dad said it was kind of stupid and the whole meeting/presentation was a waste of time and kind of pointless. My parents aren't religious and are fairly accepting heck my dad‚Äôs job is literally to help more minorities get hired in the government but both of them just make inward comments around the house when its just us three (my dad, mom and I) that make me think that even though they ‚Äòoutwardly accept it that it‚Äôll be different when it‚Äôs their kid‚Äô. 

The gsa alliance at my highschool is pushed into one little corner just last week they got a wall where they painted a nice scenic background, painted and hung up a bunch of different pride flags and taped a whole door in rainbow (it was a janitors closret inbetween the two entrances to the bathrooms).  Lots of kids hated on it and spewed other bullshit. We don‚Äôt have any gender neutral bathrooms in my school just male and female bathrooms with no doors on them which even I think are awful. People can hear you taking a shit from a mile away and the whole student body is protesting against it. I want to feel accepted not like I have no privacy. And even as safe as I said my country was (I‚Äôm in canada) believe or not by federal law conversion therapy is still legal here. There are only three provinces that outlawed it not including mine. I know it‚Äôs much worse for other people out there but that‚Äôs still scary to me. My gsa club and another from a different highschool have brought it to the attention of our provincial government and they like ‚Äúaddressed us and heard us out‚Äù then did jack shit. 

I‚Äôm also pansexual so already amongst some people by sexual orientation isn‚Äôt real. I‚Äôm very publicly out as being pan atleast at school but gender is a bit more of a how should I put it... touchy subject at my school. I‚Äôm going to get wigs but at first just start wearing them on wednesdays calling it ‚Äúwig Wednesday‚Äù but then slowly transfer over to wearing them more often.

So is it ok if I identify as genderfluid or genderqueer? Is that what I am? \n\nAnd also, tips on how to make a very feminine body more androgynous or male? Because I'm overly endowed in the the chest and I don't really want to cut my hair. I don't think a binder would be sufficient, but I've read the ace bandage method I used before is dangerous.\n\nAlso...

Okay, so I've be**e**n on HRT for over a year 
(amab, known I was not male for ~1.5 yrs). I was always pretty dang sure I'm binary female - I hate being seen as a *man*, and being treated as such.
However over the past few months I've had these times where I feel like a boy. Not a *man*, but a soft little fem*boy*. And during those rare days I like being called a boy and they/them or he/him over being called a girl. I only just started really experimenting and telling my partners, but it seems a rare thing.
My presentation doesn't change too much yet, I mostly just wear my shorts and baggy sweatshirts that I'd wear on a lazy day as a girl, but I want that pastel e-boy look y'know? My attitude and voice change a little bit too, though not an extreme amount, and I'd prefer going by a different name (JoJo or Jesse) I think? Though I already legally changed my name and I am happy with it (Josie).

My main bae (MTF) has been supportive, but she's struggled to understand a little because we transitioned at the same time. My other partners seem supportive too, but it's not been long and I'm not public about it really until I figure this all out.

I never really had any guy friends so I don't know how to interact with them? it's all messed up cause it's not like im ever going to get with a guy anyway, because i want to be comfortable in a relationship and being with a woman or a nonbinary person makes me feel more comfortable than with a guy. like the anxiety i feel with guys vs girls is very different. painful vs oh! that's a warm feeling!

I came across the idea of shaving the bottom portion of my scalp, leaving the section on top longer; if I pulled it up in a pony or a bun it could look very masculine, but if I left it down it would still be shoulder length and I could even curl it or whatever.

I am a biological male. I was deeply uncomfortable with my feminine side/fantasies when I was late teen and young adult. Now I don't care as much, but I can't help but feel that maybe my mind has created a some sort of coping mechanism as to enjoy sex as a straight male, because this male side kind of developed after years of discomfort with majority feminine fantasies.

However, my male side has seriously taken over during the last year to the point where I am starting to believe this was some kind of latent masculine identity. I legitimately enjoy it. Additionally, when I was initially going through puberty, I fantasized about women exclusively until I found pornography. I can't help but feel that left some kind of imprint on my young mind.

Both ""sides"" have grown stronger in their influence on my personality. When I have sexual fantasies as a female, I tend to have more classically feminine thoughts and mannerisms. The obverse is true for my male side.

It literally feels like there are two people living in me sometimes. It makes dating and even friendly relationships near impossible.

New here but really looking for some guidance and or advice. 
Here's some backstory
Growing up I was always a little ""tomboy"" and kept many of those traits with me up until now (I'm 21 and in college). I have Borderline Personality Disorder which helps to make me feel like I have no idea who I am and all of that fun stuff but recently I've been trying to dress more feminine for a job I had. 
I started to really like it but now it's like every other day I hate how feminine clothes look on me.
So one day I texted my boyfriend and said ""I look pretty cute. I really can do both. Be a tomboy and be a girly girl. And both at the same time too. Wtf am I a chameleon"" 
He responded with ""It's incredible how closely that sounds to non-binary people I know who finally came to that realization""
So I've been doing more thinking and research on it and I'm honestly looking for real answers from real people. 
I dont want to transition or anything like that, I just want to know if what I'm feeling is similar to others experiences.

So I‚Äôm 25 and I‚Äôve been starting to question my gender recently. I‚Äôm AFAB and have identified as a cis woman for my entire life, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like that‚Äôs not quite right. Sometimes I feel very in touch with my femininity and I want to partake in a lot of ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù hobbies, want to dress more femme, etc, but other times I don‚Äôt really feel connected to my gender at all. I typically dress more neutral (jeans/yoga pants and tshirts) and sometimes I get really weirded out when people refer to me as a woman or with she/her pronouns. I‚Äôve even started to consider binding sometimes to get a more androgynous silhouette, but sometimes I strive for an almost hyper-feminine ‚Äúfull of curves‚Äù look. I definitely don‚Äôt think I experience dysphoria, it‚Äôs more like a general disconnect to gender at all when I‚Äôm not in one of my super femme swings. 

I talked to my fianc√© about it last night and he thought that maybe I‚Äôm genderfluid, and that my fluidity goes between agender or some other NB state and 100% girl. I just thought I‚Äôd get some opinions from other people who might have gone through this as well, especially since I‚Äôve only known genderfluid folks who swing between masc and femme, and I definitely never feel like a *guy*, ya know?
