Maybe someone else is in a similar situation. From birth being assigned as male, in reality I´m just feeling as a genderless human beeing 🙂 I don´t  bemoan my male genitals but female ones would also be totally ok for me. Optically, talking about my body proportions I have the luck not to appear extremly masculine but regardless I´m still being gendered mostly as a male. This in some way doesn´t let me feel very comfortable. It would be great to slide a bit more from male to female. Especially breast growth, softer skin and less body hair would be a quite important deal for me. 

So now to achive this, I got tube of estradiol gel, but I´m not really sure what to do 🙈 The prescribed dose from the doctor are 2 pumps a day. This in fact would give me everything I´m seeking for. The only, but at the same time very huge struggle is the thing with my fertility. Despite being pansexual I´d really like to have children one day and for this to keep all of my body functions considering this, intact. 

So long story short: If you only take estradiol without anything else and at a low dose, will it affect the male testicles in a way that it causes permanent damage? Will they irreversibly shrink and completely stop producing testosterone and sperms? Will I then permanently depend on hormone supplements to stay healthy, even if microdosing or am I just panicking?

Yesterday I had a sit down with the customer service director and brought up my discomfort. While I didn't feel like it was my time to come out, I did mention how sad it made me feel to hear disparagement and came at it from it being an unprofessional attitude. I asked if we could introduce diversity training and other forms of inclusivity around the office. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the CSD agreed and was upset to hear that these sorts of things had been going on. The CSD mentioned that diversity training is a great start and it's going to be pitched to the executive team ASAP.

Most recently this line of thinking came up again because the way that I'd like to present (at times) is very “feminine”. So it keeps giving me impostor syndrome, because while wearing certain things would make me dysphoric, it's what I'd be happiest in.

The version of me that makes me happiest when I imagine it in my head isn't necessarily gendered, it's just me, and it's not necessary male or female. The thought of being undefinable and ambiguous  is something that makes me really happy and kinda gives me gender euphoria (?) but I feel like part of why I like the idea of it is because of my personal values surrounding gender, and also because dysphoria. And the idea of fucking with people's heads like that makes me laugh. And when I consider my actual self, I don't necessarily consider myself masculine or feminine either, because the idea of certain traits being masculine or feminine is all bunk to me.

87,2019-08-02 20:58:04,cl9tps,3,9,"Hi, everyone. I’m Polar. 22 years old, AFAM. Until I was 20, I firmly identified as a cisgender woman.

When the summer after my 20th birthday came around, I knew something felt off—that something had changed—but I couldn’t figure out what.

I didn’t feel comfortable in my own body anymore. I had periods of depersonalization/derealization during high school, but this was worse. When I brought myself to question my gender identity, the mold broke.

“Normal [cisgender] people don’t question their genders, so I must not be normal,” I thought.

Yet, even though female didn’t feel “right,” male didn’t feel right, either. I felt caught between both or felt like neither, stuck outside the spectrum.

So I identified as non-binary. Being neither exclusively female nor male felt right to me. Gender fluid was too shifting and genderqueer felt too androgynous.

I couldn’t find the words to express how I felt, and it confused and worried my parents, especially my mother.

When I discovered chest binders, I ordered two (size large) from gc2b and hid them from my parents. When I was able to get one on, it was glorious. I wore intermittently for about three months.

Then, it just kind of went away. I don’t know if I repressed it or not, but I felt uncomfortable wearing the binders, so I put them away.

Fast forward two years, I’ve lost weight and donated most of my old bras. I came across the binders and, even though they’re a size too big now, I still got that same giddy feeling as I did when I first wore them.

I’m planning to keep them, as gc2b recommends wearing a size up from your primary size when you’re exercising or swimming, anyway.

There’s some slight gapping at the bottom of the binder, but not so much that it’s too loose.

I’m no longer uncomfortable with my breasts, but I did enjoy how I looked and felt with the binder on. There are some days when I want my breasts and other days when I don’t.

I know that no one can answer this besides me, but some guidance would be appreciated.

I was telling a story about my friends and me as kids, and after finishing the story I realized I had accidentally used the wrong pronoun once. I froze up and didn’t know what to do, because a lot of people were listening and I wasn’t sure if  apologizing and correcting myself after the fact would make my friend more uncomfortable by drawing attention to them.

I haven't felt able to do any of these things yet though because I live \~45 minutes from my parents and still see them very often.

I came out to my parents 4 years ago. Mom didn't take it well, Dad took it better but still not fully accepting, and since then they have both kinda... pretended I never came out. They still use the wrong name and pronouns for me, and we haven't discussed it since, but I think they thought my coming out was just a phase that I'm out of now (spoiler alert: not a phase, still very NB). Though I don't rely on my parents for much, I am still on their insurance til I turn 25/26 (whichever it is now), so I'm holding off on anything medical til then. But otherwise, just knowing that they would probably stop talking to me is keeping me from transitioning.

Family matters a lot to me because I used to not get along with my parents well, especially not with my mom, but since I've moved out for college we get along much better, and this is something that I don't want to change. I would hate to ruin this tentatively better relationship I have with my parents, but I don't think I can have a healthy relationship with them and transition at the same time. I don't think I can transition much either without them finding out--I see them too much, and I'm on their insurance, so they'd find out about any legal or medical transition pretty quick, so trying to be subtle about it isn't an option. 

I still can't figure out which is more important to me, having a good relationship with my parents or living more authentically (when I'm not happy with how I look but not unhappy either, just very neutral). I feel like if my parents stopped talking to me once I began transitioning, or even if I just came out again to affirm I'm still NB, I'd be the one regretting ruining that relationship even though I know it's their unwillingness to accept me that is ruining the relationship.

210,2019-08-04 21:59:39,cm28vh,2,3,"I have a question that I’m hoping someone/some people can help me with. What is the difference between a “standard” (unspecified, for lack of a better word) non-binary gender identity and a gender fluid identity?

I know that gender fluid is a subset of non-binary, but could I be gender fluid?

I started questioning my gender identity two years ago (age 20) due to my breasts. They weren’t even very large, but I realized that cisgender women didn’t ever think of **not** having their breasts, even if they didn’t like them.

For me, there are some days when I feel more feminine, some masculine, some androgynous, and some neither gender. That’s when/why I first identified as non-binary, because I didn’t feel exclusively male or female, despite being AFAB.

I’d never consider permanent breast surgery, so that’s why I use temporary methods like compression binding or tape binding.

There are definitions of the different gender identities, but is there a “feeling” or “knowing” that separates an umbrella term like non-binary into its branches? Thanks.

I know that’s there’s no checklist, but I’m trying to figure this out.

Feel free to ask me any questions and I’ll answer them to the best of my ability.",NonBinary,Difference between a “standard” non-binary gender identity and gender fluid?,1564981179.0,"{'created_utc': 1564955979, 'id': 'cm28vh', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'I have a question that I’m hoping someone/some people can help me with.

What’s the best way to put on and take off a binder?

I tried putting one on today and the back panel got twisted. Is there any way to prevent that from happening?

I eventually got the binder up around my underarms and was able to get it off by pulling up the back panel.

I know that the panel is stretchy and resilient, and that yanking on it a few times won’t damage it, but I don’t want to consistently do that. I want to wear them without damaging them.

Ever since I came out (a couple of months) my mother has been missgendering me. Not on purpose, though she isn't trying very hard. It feels bad, but she has a hard time remembering things like that anyway, so I let it go, thinking that was it.

The other day my mom and I were talking about another non-binary person who also uses gender neutral pronouns, and she kept referring to them by name (\*insert name here\* does this, \*insert name here\* said that), at which point I realized It's not all about remembering. She remembers they identify using gender neutral pronouns and is purposefully avoiding it. When I confronted her about it, she said it was because it's grammatically incorrect, and blah blah. I tried to explain it to her, told her to think of it as if she doesn't know their gender (because she said she can recognized their agab). But she insisted saying that it's just difficult for her because she is from a different generation. I told her it's probably not the reason, and that she was just uneducated on this subject, because I (and many others) felt the same way before learning about it properly. She threw back any explanation I had with a ""It'll just take me some time to get used to it"". But how is she gonna get used to it if she won't learn about it, or even once, use my preferred pronouns. 

I'm lucky to have people in my life that no matter what, accept and love me. But she is the only person I thought actually supported and encouraged me (everybody else kind of treats it as a 'joke' or just a phase). She keeps telling me how happy and proud she is by the positive change it's made in me, how I've finally found what I had so desperately been looking for for 6 years, yet she still hasn't used they/them. I've poured my heart out trying to explain its importance to me so many times, just to be met back with \*agab\*, it makes me feel not valid.

Do you think it's just going to take time, like she said? Or should I keep trying to explain it to her until it's stuck in her head forever?

272,2019-08-06 02:10:17,cmkj8o,5,17,"Hi friends! I'm looking for some advice about hesitant feelings I've been having towards changing my name.

Some Background info: I'm 22 years old, non binary, and go by they them pronouns. I'm out with my identity and pronouns to close friends as well as my partner but that's pretty much it. I've only mentioned the possibility of changing my name to a few trusted people briefly. Only my partner knows what my new name is. 

I've had a name in mind for years that I've always envisioned myself using when I am ""more out"" about being non binary. I pictured myself being brave and taking on this new name as soon as I ""come out more"" by telling my family about my identity and being ""more out"" in college. I didn't want to change my name in the past when I was halfway through university and face any potential push back from my classmates and profs. So I figured I should wait until college to enact this change when I'll be meeting a bunch of new people, instead of facing this giant hurdle when my peers have already known me by another name for years. I also always told myself that I would come out to my parents the summer before entering college.

This has been the plan for years and now its coming up in a few weeks, and I'm terrified. 

I don't know if its because of these nervous feelings or something else but I'm second guessing whether my ""new name"" really fits. I'm doubting myself, the new name doesn't feel like me the same way my current name doesn't feel like me. But it's not like there's a more recent different name that's attracting me now, it's just that nothing feels like ""me"". Suddenly I'm doubting a lot of what I though would be certain about my future and how I come out and how i get myself finally be ""me"".

I'm worried that I'm taking too big a step in such a short period of time by changing my name very publicly. I'm worried that I'll quickly realize that this new name isn't for me and I'll have to go through some sort of backlash by changing my name again. 

I'm not sure if anyone else felt this way while coming out or has any advice. I just haven't had much luck in finding others who may have felt this way and how they coped.

Warning for semi-graphic description of surgery at the end.

So essentially, I was watching videos of top surgery procedures as a way to mentally prep myself and get used to the idea of what my body will go through when I finally get surgery. The videos were fairly graphic, given they are literally showing a live surgery, and I told my friends my thoughts about it because that’s something I’m literally going to go through and I wanted to talk to /someone/ about it.

One of my friends thought it was as interesting as I did since she’s very into surgery (and medical procedures in general), while my other friend who is a trans guy got upset about it and was like “dude what the fuck”. I apologized for being graphic even before he said anything, but he was still upset about it and his response to me apologizing a second time was basically “I don’t want to read that because I’m going to go through it someday”.  

And that’s basically where we start the problem because /I am also going to go through this surgery/ that’s literally why I was talking about it. And he continued to act like I’m an uninvolved third-party talking about something only he will experience which was extremely frustrating to me.  Like he emphasized how top-surgery is /for him/ when I am also getting it to alleviate my own dysphoria.

I understand it could be a bit out of line to describe it as “the muscle and fat is exposed and they shove their hand up under the skin/ you can see the muscle twitch when it’s cauterized” but like that’s literally what happens?? And I apologized for my description of it but he still acted like I don’t deserve to talk about it when we’re both afab and trans masculine, I just haven’t fully committed to aligning as “male”.

Those two have always been more receptive to my identity and the fluid world that it has always been than anyone else.

It's not important what he actually said - it was weird and rambling and I was left very baffled and slightly uncomfortable but also amused by the ensuing 'compliment'. Anyway, not the point. 

The title line here is my girlfriend's response after he left. She was offended on my behalf. And on her behalf I guess. She'd been exposed to him before and he was insistent she'd find a boyfriend (yeah this old guy is weird). So me being read as a guy invalidates her identity as a lesbian. Which makes sense. And it's not even like I'm out to her about my gender. I'm barely even out to myself.

I'm proud of my androgyny though. Or at least my moments of it. And so even if it was just manifested homophobia coming from a weird guy (because I was dressed more femme than usual today so let's face it I probably didn't even look androgynous) I sort of enjoyed the moment. I didn't speak because I didn't know what to say but also on some level because I didn't want to give myself away with my voice. It seems so dumb in retrospect. 

But I know I'm not supposed to be proud of being occasionally able to be mistaken for the opposite sex. I'm supposed to be offended. I know my gnc girlfriend probably isn't actually judging my gender expression. But to know that she sees me so definitively (and importantly for her lesbian identity) as female, kinda...kinda stings a little.

The thing is at the end of the day she's probably more invested in my gender than me. And I'm not desperately planning to change my body's sex characteristics in the near future. Or even my pronouns. And I already know she'll be cool with my name change. 

So I'm not sure I can put a finger on this feeling, not just today but in general. I don't feel like a lesbian but I don't feel straight or bi either. I've got the asexual thing down... and gender wise I don't know how I feel but I'm fairly certain I'm overthinking it because I always do.

I know that non-binary is an identity by itself, but it’s also an umbrella term for other identities.

That’s four distinct “feelings,” but I don’t consider them strong enough to be separate genders on their own. Therefore, genderfluid is out. Would that be genderflux, or another identity?

Yet, even when I have my leaning days, there is still the “standard” feeling of my gender.

After some more reading I started putting it in the drier for 15 mins. And it didn't make much of a difference. Also there's a hole where the front inside panel is taring away from the stitching... so that's great.

So I'll be brutally honest. My sister now identifies as non binary, and I think it's a product of her crowd, and not who she is as a person. I think it's attention seeking.

I'll lay out the progression.

Step 1: Everyday girly girl. 0-14

Step 2: Discovers tumblr 14-15

Step 3: Finds alt sexuality communities and gets deeply involved 15-16

Step 4: Starts dying hair and dressing in what I would describe as butch lesbian (again I'm being brutally honest here). 16

Step 5: My spidey senses are tingling and I tease her (kindly, we have a solid relationship) about being a lesbian 16-17

Step 6: She tells me she's pansexual and starts dating women. Her first lesbian relationship goes badly and she starts dating men. 17-18

Step 7: She changes her name to a male name, and tells everyone she's non binary. Now on the 4th relationship she's still dating men. -19

&amp;#x200B;

And now we're at the present. I feel like she ""they"" has developed an identity to fit in with the crowd she met on tumblr. I feel like it's attention seeking. I don't feel like it's genuine.

465,2019-08-09 09:16:17,cnzuze,11,17,"Hi folks, I'm new here and fairly new to this whole thing, looking for some advice/clarity. I'm a 33 year old woman/afab who think I might be leaning towards the gender fluid spectrum. Here is some back story:

From as far back as I can remember in my childhood I was attracted to women. I came out as a lesbian in my early teens, and for about a decade I was also very fascinated with androgynous gender expressions. In that time and place where I grew up there was no concept about non-binary or gender fluid as a gender identification, had that been a thing with which I was familiar I would probably have identified as such. I remember my goal was to look like ""a boy who looks like a girl who looks like a boy"". I cut my hair short and was binding my breasts for a while, but it wasn't a lot of dysphoria associated with it, mostly just not wanting to associate to any one gender, but exist in-between, or as both simultaneously. 

When I was 22 I had dated my first girlfriend for four years, and things were headed down a path of stability and life-long commitment that I increasingly felt I wasn't ready for. I wanted to go out and see the world (and other people - she was my first) which lead me to break up with her, which I did in an awful and messy way due to being young and emotionally immature and unprepared for dealing with this. In this whole chaos I ended up dating a mutual friend, in secret, and when this came out me and my new girlfriend were shunned by our group of friends, which incidentally also happened to be a large part of the queer community in the city where we all lived. A year and a half later me and the new girlfriend broke up, and shortly thereafter I ended up dating a guy from my school. This was the last nail in the coffin for me in the eyes of the queer community, and I was no longer welcome there.

After that, I for some unknown reason have mostly been attracted to men. I grew my hair out (unrelated event) and was horrified what a difference it was to be on the ""correct"" side of the whole sexuality/gender expression spectrum in terms of how people treated me (""correct"" in the eyes of the bullshit made up rules opposed on us by society). I haven't been with a woman since then, not out of some principle, just because I have always only gone with what feels right, and as young never questioned or felt weirded out by my attraction to women as it felt completely natural to me, and now I mostly feel that way towards men (and tomboy girls). Then things just kind of went along this way until a little while ago.

All throughout this time, though, I have always dreamed of having a man's body in terms of a beard and a penis. I will have dreams about this at least once a week. I have mostly thought of this as ""ah bummer, I really wish I could have this but I guess it'll never happen"" the same way you might dream about flying or such. I will add that this isn't combined with any particular dysphoria around my female body, just a desire to have that as well, or sometimes instead of. Then a month back a friend of mine was visiting me from the US. She is very involved in the queer community where she lives and we talked a lot about this, I expressed my feelings that I no longer have a place there because of mostly dating men, and probably to a large part from that trauma of being shunned by my whole circle of friends (I now have new, amazing friends). I remember how annoyed we were when people would claim to be gay and then only date people of the opposite sex, and I didn't want to burden the community with that, also I have had a lot of guilt around my own sexuality happening to perfectly fit the whole, made up stupid cliché of ""it's just a phase"". I have felt that while for me, personally, my sexuality just is what it happens to be, if I disclosed it to others it could be harmful for the queer community. So I just don't have a name for it. Anyways, my friend who visited had a much more forgiving look on things which was inspiring. Then one day we compared dreams of the previous night, and I recounted one of my reoccurring dreams of waking up with a dick and being all ecstatic about it. I then told her of how it was such a shame that I could never have that. She just kind of said, well maybe you can explore that some, and it was like she kicked open a door by saying that. I have not been able to get it out of my head since. Pretty much after that day I have had this intense longing to present more as male/gender fluid, I'm cutting my hair short next week and am so excited to try this out. I'm also trying to flatten my chest with sport bras and such.

I guess my question is, I just don't know what to do with this. I feel like I can't claim my place within this community for the reasons stated above, and I don't know if what I'm experiencing is gender fluidity or some related identity.  I read somewhere that wanting to dress a certain way doesn't make you gender fluid as that is rather a state of mind than your outward expression. This feels different than an aesthetic choice, though, but I also don't dare to trust my instincts enough as clearly I'm changing between polarities (gay/straight, femme looking/not-femme looking now, I guess?) and it seems to take some decade to circle through these phases too. Also it has just been a month, so who the heck knows, even if it feels like a revelation, like I have unlocked some aspect of myself. And also I'm 33, and all the other people who struggle with these thoughts seem to be around 1,5-two decades my junior. I don't want to impose myself in a community of people who experience a whole lot more profound feelings of dysphoria/gender identity than myself, which I also recognize is kind of a messed up way to look at it.

I've been working on accepting the idea of being non-binary for a bit now, rather than simply convincing myself I am female and then avoiding thinking about or acknowledging the subject as much as possible.  And while non-binary seems to fit well with how I regard myself, I still have a few hesitations in actually accepting the label.

478,2019-08-09 15:00:00,co3iy5,14,12,"Yes. Hello. 

I’m new here and I need some sort of advice or validation or I may go insane. 


I’m an afab. My entire life i’ve had issues with the way that I’ve been seen solely as a female. When I was around 7/8 I started feeling weirded out when someone referred to me as “she”. 

However now, as an adult, i am totally okay with being referred to as “she”, and even if someone would say “he” that wouldn’t really mind that either. 

Instead of feeling like my gender moves, or changes, I feel that I am everything and nothing all at once. If “alien” was a gender identity i’d go with that. It’s been driving me absolutely up the wall for years now and I think after feeling things out, and experimenting with being bi-gender (which didn’t work, and felt uncomfortable) 

I think i’ve landed on non-binary and the more research I do and the more I start to see myself as a human, as myself, rather than just a woman or just a man, the more comfortable I become. 

I lean more towards feminine clothes and presenting as a female, but when I know people see me that way it causes me extreme discomfort. And I wish more people looked at me and saw a “them”. As i’ve sort of become more comfortable with it I’d like to be called by they/them pronouns, but i’m also fine with any of them. None of them cause me discomfort. But the lack of gender is where my heart lies and who I am at the core of my being regardless of how feminine I look or what my sex is. 

I’m a streamer on twitch and there’s a video game called Apex Legends and one of the characters (and mine that i play with) is completely non binary. they/them pronouns and the creators are very straightforward about them being an enigma. A powerful genderless enigma that is just..... what they are. And they can’t be put into a box. 

I almost cry when I think about that character. I’m almost living vicariously through them because I’ve only come out to 2 people. Only 2 people on the planet know I feel this way. And I’m scared. I’m scared of coming out. I’m scared what my boyfriend will think. I’m scared of it but I also want to be seen as who i am (they/them) instead of something i’m okay with (she/her) 

I’m thinking that my obsession with this character may be a starting point to me at the very least living my life within my friends and family the way that I want to. 


I know this is long, and I’m sorry I just needed to vent. I don’t have a community or anyone irl to talk to about this. And within finding a character that i relate too so much that it makes me cry tears of absolute joy and closure, has me thinking that I may have finally figured out my gender identity. And that I’m on a road to fully loving myself. For the genderless blob that I am.

526,2019-08-10 08:11:44,cofecn,4,15,"Hi! This is a throwaway account, only because I’d like to figure myself out before people who know of my main account see me posting about this. 

Since birth, I have identified as a cis female. (I am 24 btw if that matters) But I’ve never felt quite comfortable with it, in ways that are hard to describe. I have always had both feminine and masculine interests (not that any hobbies etc. have genders, but like stereotypically). I grew up playing with dolls with my sister, and digging for worms with my guy friends. I never made lasting friendships with girls, because I always wanted to do the things that they considered ‘boyish.’ In my earlier years, I dressed in all pink and had long hair, but as I’ve grown up, I have worn more ‘men’s’ clothes and have cut (and even shaved) my hair many times. I’ve never been one to like makeup that much, my idea of styling my hair consists of dying it a new color and combing it until it looks decent, I wear more of my husband’s clothes than I do my own. Once, my mom and I were watching a tv show where the word “androgynous” was used, and at that time I didn’t know what it meant. Once she told me, I was amazed at the idea that someone could actually dress and present in a way that was neither and both (at the same time) masculine and feminine. I wanted that, but I was raised in a family where gender stereotypes are heavily enforced. 

In my later years, I started to wonder if I was actually a trans man. I don’t know how to explain it, other than I just didn’t feel comfortable with the idea of being a girl. I just don’t think it fits who I am. I toyed with the idea of presenting as male for a while, but that made me feel just as uncomfortable. Not that it’s a bad thing to be male, or female for that matter, it just didn’t feel like “me.” 

I’ve always had discomfort with my body. The big area of my concern is my chest. I am slightly on the larger size up there, and I despise it. These two boulders on my chest cause me pain daily, both in back pain and mental pain. I developed an eating disorder a few years back because I thought that if I could lose enough weight, these lumps, as well as all other curves of my body, would go away. But of course, that didn’t happen. (I am recovered from the ED now thankfully) I wondered for a long time what was wrong with me, why I couldn’t be happy in my body, why I didn’t feel comfortable with some of the main parts of me and who I am. 

Then, I heard of the term non-binary.

The more I looked into it, the more right it started to feel. The idea of not being a girl, but also not being a boy, fascinated and excited me. For some reason, I had never considered that that was possible. I have my masculine days and I have my feminine days, and that’s always made me doubt who I am. But now, after learning more and more about what being non-binary is, I’m starting to feel like I found the answer. 

I have started using they/them pronouns in a few online circles, and I love it. However, I don’t necessarily mind using she/her pronouns as well. I have started looking into binding as well. My husband helped me wrap my chest with tape one day (only for a few minutes as I’m not sure if using tape is safe) and when I put on a shirt and saw a flat (or at least flatter) chest, I was over the moon. It’s like so many of my insecurities about my body went away for the few moments it lasted. I’ve told my husband that if/when we ever have the money to, I’d like to have my chest surgically flattened, and he is supportive, but I haven’t told him about the other questions about my gender yet. 

Of course, even with all of this, I always have the question in my head of whether or not I’m making all this up. It feels right, but I just don’t know.

(I am 24 btw if that matters) But I’ve never felt quite comfortable with it, in ways that are hard to describe. I have always had both feminine and masculine interests (not that any hobbies etc. have genders, but like stereotypically). I grew up playing with dolls with my sister, and digging for worms with my guy friends. I never made lasting friendships with girls, because I always wanted to do the things that they considered ‘boyish.’ In my earlier years, I dressed in all pink and had long hair, but as I’ve grown up, I have worn more ‘men’s’ clothes and have cut (and even shaved) my hair many times. I’ve never been one to like makeup that much, my idea of styling my hair consists of dying it a new color and combing it until it looks decent, I wear more of my husband’s clothes than I do my own. Once, my mom and I were watching a tv show where the word “androgynous” was used, and at that time I didn’t know what it meant.

Hi, this'll probably be a long one, but I really need to write my thoughts out all at once and have people listen.

**Part one: The journey begins**

I think I should start of chronologically.
One and a half years ago I realized I'm trans, and I came out to a group of online friends and was ""publicly"" out on my reddit account. (I didn't come out to any of my irl friends since I thought like I just didn't have a deep enough friendship to come out to them and was also scared they would be transphobic.) I chose Katrin as my name and used she/her pronouns and started to grow my hair out. However, I always intended to cut it short once I would be able to get HRT and had more of a butch look in mind in general. Back then I thought this was just because I have a slight interest in the punk scene, where more androgynous looks aren't a rarity. I still weirdly felt distant to the general idea of being MtF and sometimes I couldn't identify with the experience of other trans women, for example wasn't I always repulsed by the idea of being a boy and never was really interested in many girl activities. I also wished for a not as feminine and curvy body as other trans women, but I suppose that's all just personal interest.

**Part two: ""Oh no""**

I pretty much was fine with the idea of being butch MtF for about a year until I got an ""Oh no"" moment: I always keep reddit posts of transition goals in a note on my phone and after I went through them I realized most fo them were slightly to very gender non-comforming. I messaged a friend who helped me after I cracked for the first time and told her what was up. They asked me if I want to be called girl or also dislike that. Back then I couldn't answer the question and I just said I would've wanted a female childhood. They also calmed me down by saying they're also kinda gender non-comfirming. After that I just settled on me just being scared of the high expectations society puts on trans people to fit the exact gender roles they're transitioning too, and probably just being *fine* with the idea of being femme nb, but not outright preferring it. So I just kept moving into the direction I was headed before: Butch MtF.

**Part three: Get fucked, homophobes**

Last year I also failed 9th grade for a couple of reasons (mostly being too demotivated too care and being in a less then optimal work atmosphere full of assholes) and had to retake it. In the new class I got *way* easier and befriending people and most of them weren't homophobes. So after a lot of convincing by my online friends I slowly came out to a group of very supportive friends which by chance were all mostly queer too. (We're pretty much the nerdy queer group of our year.) I felt way more comfortable around them and also told them about how I actually prefer more butch looks. 
Because of this new friend group and class I got more confident in myself and didn't fear the homophobic parts of my school as much. So all went great and my plan was working and I slowly considered coming out to my class and parents and all is good and fun... until it all kinda came crashing down the last few weeks.

**Part four: Fuck wait no go back**

As it turns out, this class in which I finally felt like I was welcome for the first time in my school history is going to be split up next year! And even better, my friend group with it! And even better, one of the three to five homophobes of that class will be in my half too! And even better, the other half will be filled with the rest of another class that isn't really welcoming of queer people either. 

Fuck. Please go back.
 
The more important thing for this sub and post is what happened during my vacation: While visiting Romania and my relatives, the thoughts of me being nb got back. This time they were so penetrant, I immediatly started seriously sitting down and discussing my gender identity with myself and friends... is what I *should've* done.

What instead happened, was [this](https://i.imgur.com/RHeM746.jpg).

I messaged my very lovely ldr girlfriend, my sister and that friend I already talked to about this, and said to them that I'm questioning. At one point I wrote a mini theory of my relationship to being non-binary in my notebook/diary, which was concluded with ""I don't have to have a gender because I don't *need* a gender to be myself"", but the next day the confidence and that statement was gone. Then I practically just created stupid avatars, slapped the nb pride flag on them and called it a day until I was up all night just not being able to sleep because of this, just like yesterday when I decided that this has to stop and I *really* should write it all out to figure things out. Thankfully, u/regionalcryptid offered me their help, so I decided to write them that night. Until I relized it was like 2 am and I need sleep, so I instead promised them to write everything out the next morning. (Take a guess what this is...) 

Having concluded the timeline so far, I'd say I should get to the pro, contras and [external screaming.](https://youtu.be/6iP0tSmJiIY).

**Part five: Pro, contra and hmmmm.**

Having already mentioned my list of transition goals, picrews and my self image I think I should start there.

Obviously, whatever I am, I metioned liking to have short hair. Or, well, feminine short hair? Whenever I imagine my ideal self (if that is possible) I rarely have long hair. If a avatar editor doesn't have short hair options, sidecuts or something similar (often what I like to call the [enby]() [mess]() ). My transition goals list is full of either short haired and butch women or, what lately fills it a lot, not overtly feminine non-binary people. At first the enbys where the exception to the rule, but now it's full of them. 
(If I were to use the futch scale to describe my ideal self I'd land somewhere [here.](https://i.imgur.com/cJTm5hm.png))

Next step I suppose is my general relationship with the concept of being non-binary.

This'll sound weird, but I have this weird unexplainable positive feeling towards the idea of being non-binary. Two days ago I kept saying ""I'm non-binary"" over and over again to see how it feels and it just feels *right*. But I just feel like an imposter when I think I'm non-binary, that I'm just faking it for attention. But whenever I think THAT I feel sad that I'm not non-binary. I have no problems with having they/them pronouns, but I also don't dislike she/her pronouns. I don't have that many problems with male clothing and when I have they're often related with being *perceived* as male, not with the clothes themselves. But I also like the idea of dressing gender-neutral and really want to wear a skirt or dress.

And honestly, I just like the idea of me being non-binary even though I don't really believe in it. I just like to imagine to not be confined by gender and just look and act how I want to look and act. (Have fun with your 8 upvotes on r/egg_irl) 

The last bit brings me to the last reason why I'm not sure if I'm non-binary. I feel like I can't pull that of, because I feel like I'll be made fun of and serve as a bad example for non-binary people since I'll almost definitely won't be either completely androgynous nor fit in gender-roles, no matter if I'm MtX or MtF. I couldn't care less, but my environment and the current negative view of non-binary people in the general population hold me back. I don't want to end up as the punching bag of those two jokes conservatives have about trans people nor enforce the stereotype that enbys are just attention craving teens that dye their hair to be quirky. I just feel obligated to avoid the possibility of having the transphobic views of parts of my school and the population be enforced further. 

I simply don't want to make it worse for actual enbys in my town because I just wasn't comfortable with calling myself butch MtF.

I also feel like I'm basically what TERF-Idiots talk about when they mean that teens are just becoming non-binary for attention and *the trans* are tricking them into thinking that bla bla bla... 

Even though I absolutely think that TERFs are full of shit, I can't stop thinking ""But what if they're right about me?"" 

Rationally, I know that TERFs can suck ContraPoints off for all I care about them, but emotionally this made this whole thing harder.

**Part six: You decide!**

Well, I hope that should be all I wanted to rant about and I hope someone is still here. If you got any help or ideas how to help, please tell me. I've constantly been thinking I'm getting closer to the solution in the evenings, but feel always further away the next morning and I'm tired of feeling like that.

I want to apologize in advance for this annoyingly long post.

I’m 23 and AMAB, and I’ve been been identifying as non-binary for a few months now.  Mainly just in my own head, cause i havent really come out to anyone i know in real life yet, cause i have zero self esteem and i’m terrified what my friends and family will think.  Im also terrified that maybe im not really non-binary and im just faking it to make myself feel better about myself.

I dont think i “feel” male, but i dont necessarily feel female either (although sometimes i think i do).  I feel like my ideal body would be genderless and androgynous, with no reproductive organs.  

Back in high school, i remember sometimes secretly wanting to be female, but that was only some of the time; a lot of times i wouldnt care that i was male, or at least i didnt really think about it.  I would sometimes feel compelled to find ways to make myself look/feel more feminine, usually in small ways, like wearing womens’ jeans or wearing eyeliner.  I used to try on female clothing in secret sometimes.  I thought my body had a somewhat-feminine shape and was proud of that (really i was just fat, lmao).  I shaved my legs and body hair sometimes.  I tried to teach myself to have really feminine handwriting and secretly hoped that someone would mistake it for a girl’s handwriting...That probably sounds really stupid.  I went through a whole “emo” phase that, in retrospect, was somewhat just an excuse for me to try and make myself look more androgynous.  I sometimes secretly hoped someone would mistake me for a girl, but i also thought that was unrealistic.  

I was going through a bunch of stuff like that back then, but at the time, I kinda just wrote it off as “teenage hormones” and assumed everyone went through stuff like that.  I grew up/went to high school in a small, non-diverse town, do at the time, i didn’t know about non-binary identities, and i hardly knew anything about transgender either.  Im sorry for my bad grammar.  Its really late at night.  

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, in college was the first time i learned about non-binary identities and I immediately felt i identified with that. I experimented with identifying as agender for a while, but decided to drop it because I was experiencing serious self-doubt, and i had this extreme debilitating fear that i was just faking it for attention or something.  All my non-binary friends and classmates seemed so sure and so confident in their identities and they seemed like they had always known they were non-binary, and i felt like an impostor.  I went for the next like, five years after that convinced i was male, identified as male, went by he/him pronouns, etc.  i didnt really question my gender identity during that time, although in my mind, i sometimes considered myself “a genderless spirit in a male body” that felt comfortable identifying as male.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then a few months ago, i was sitting in my friend’s car, zoning out, and i completely randomly had the thought “I’m a woman.” and I felt like i’d had an epiphany.  It was the weirdest feeling and i can’t really describe it.  It was really intense.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, over the next few weeks, i steadily kept thinking about my gender identity more and more until i couldnt stop thinking about it.  I questioned for a couple weeks at first if i was mtf trans, but now i think its more likely that i’m genderfluid, or agender.  I’ve come to the realization that i really kinda hate having an uh... male part, and i wish i could get rid of it, and be completely genderless down there.  I sometimes wish my body was more feminine, but other times i just want to be androgynous.  I’ve realized i don’t necessarily like having a male voice, either

With all that being said, im still extremely afraid that maybe im just faking it to feel special or something.  Theres a bunch of stuff that just doesnt add up.  

\-I never really questioned my gender identity at all until around age 15.  

\-When i was a little kid, i mean line ages 3 to like 10, i actually had an extreme fear of being mistaken for a girl and would refuse to any clothes that i perceived as looking “feminine.”  This ended by age 10 or so, and as i said before, around age 15 was when the gender stuff really started for me.  

\-Ive never felt bothered by being referred to by male pronouns, although it equally wouldn’t bother me to be referred to by female pronouns.  I currently (mentally) refer to myself by they/them pronouns, but sometimes i still slip up and refer to myself as he/him

\-I had some weird daydream today about being old and having some boring office job and i was still male

\-sometimes i catch myself thinking about myself as a guy/a man

And a bunch of other stuff like that, probably, that i cant think of right now cause im half asleep and also i dont want to make an annoyingly long post which ive probably already done oops

Mainly just in my own head, cause i havent really come out to anyone i know in real life yet, cause i have zero self esteem and i’m terrified what my friends and family will think.  Im also terrified that maybe im not really non-binary and im just faking it to make myself feel better about myself.\n\nI dont think i “feel” male, but i dont necessarily feel female either (although sometimes i think i do).  I feel like my ideal body would be genderless and androgynous, with no reproductive organs.  \n\nBack in high school, i remember sometimes secretly wanting to be female, but that was only some of the time; a lot of times i wouldnt care that i was male, or at least i didnt really think about it.  I would sometimes feel compelled to find ways to make myself look/feel more feminine, usually in small ways, like wearing womens’ jeans or wearing eyeliner.  I used to try on female clothing in secret sometimes.  I thought my body had a somewhat-feminine shape and was proud of that (really i was just fat, lmao).  I shaved my legs and body hair sometimes.  I tried to teach myself to have really feminine handwriting and secretly hoped that someone would mistake it for a girl’s handwriting...That probably sounds really stupid.  I went through a whole “emo” phase that, in retrospect, was somewhat just an excuse for me to try and make myself look more androgynous.  I sometimes secretly hoped someone would mistake me for a girl, but i also thought that was unrealistic.  \n\nI was going through a bunch of stuff like that back then, but at the time, I kinda just wrote it off as “teenage hormones” and assumed everyone went through stuff like that.  I grew up/went to high school in a small, non-diverse town, do at the time, i didn’t know about non-binary identities, and i hardly knew anything about transgender either.  Im sorry for my bad grammar.  Its really late at night.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on, in college was the first time i learned about non-binary identities and I immediately felt i identified with that. I experimented with identifying as agender for a while, but decided to drop it because I was experiencing serious self-doubt, and i had this extreme debilitating fear that i was just faking it for attention or something.  All my non-binary friends and classmates seemed so sure and so confident in their identities and they seemed like they had always known they were non-binary, and i felt like an impostor.  I went for the next like, five years after that convinced i was male, identified as male, went by he/him pronouns, etc.  i didnt really question my gender identity during that time, although in my mind, i sometimes considered myself “a genderless spirit in a male body” that felt comfortable identifying as male.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen a few months ago, i was sitting in my friend’s car, zoning out, and i completely randomly had the thought “I’m a woman.” and I felt like i’d had an epiphany.

I'm AMAB, I figured out I was trans roughly a year ago. It just dawned on me, I was absolutely certain, still am. A few months later I began to suspect that I might be nonbinary because saying ""I'm a girl"" felt awkward. First I thought I was just insecure or something, but later figured it must be more.

First I figured out I was nonbinary, later that my gender is not static, then I realized that I was agender ""at the core"", I just sometimes have gendered feelings.  
Found a neat label too: agenderflux. Later I figured I want to emphasize my agenderness, that feels mostly like me, those gendered feelings are just occasional and don't really feel like a part of me. So I identified as and viewed myself as agender.

I'm not sure if I got to the right conclusions. I feel like I can't test reliably what makes me feel comfortable and what doesn't.  
What should I try? More outfits, asking people online to try words on me? Can you ever really ""get there""? I want to solve the puzzle so bad.

I am AFAB, 21yrs, and I have known I was nonbinary/genderqueer for six or so years, but have done nothing about it besides dressing somewhat masculinely and gritting my teeth when gendered incorrectly or when I'm on my period. I avoided coming out because I feared for my career. I recently realized that I need to take more steps to be happy, though - publically using they/them pronouns, and maybe some medical steps as well, like hormones or breast reduction. 

However, I am terrified! All the info I see is for binary trans men, and my goal is to look very neutral. I am definitely not a man or a woman. There are some things about T that interest me, and other things that super scare me. I am also so incredibly done with my period, but I don't know what the best way is for me to deal with that, especially because right now I'm not in a position to get any surgery. I guess my question is, yall that are AFAB and trying to look neutral or vaguely masculine, what steps have any of yall taken? 

I have heard of microdosing T, but I don't have enough anecdotal evidence to decide if I want to pursue something like that. It freaks me out because I want a lower voice, a less curvy shape, etc, but I am scared of having a SUPER DEEP voice or growing a ton of facial hair! My friend Will is a trans man, and I watched his voice go from quite high to INCREDIBLY low. That would be too far for me! But I understand that T is a mixed bag and you don't pick what you get.

This is probably going to be long, so thanks if you’re reading this completely and if you don’t thank you anyways. 
Also slight warning to people triggered by anatomical terms and stuff like this.

I’m in my mid twenties, my body is female everything else is confusing. 
I always had issues with my gender but it took me a while to realize that they were issues. Took around 21 years to be exact. 
As a kid I didn’t really think about it, I saw myself as a boy. I was with the boys and I never thought about me being a girl. 
Issues arose when I leaned about anatomy. For a while - I’m not joking here - I thought that I’d grow a penis during puberty, so I didn’t worry about that. I kinda just waited patiently. 
Well surprise,surprise it didn’t happen. 
So instead in my youth I packed from time to time. Starting at age 13 I guess might have been a bit younger. 
I did it only in private and was extremely cautious about it so that no one would catch me doing it. It felt right. 

I always was into girls and by now I’m guessing that I didn’t see myself as a lesbian at the time because of gender issues. I basically had this realization one day that yes I am in fact homosexual, because I’m into the same gender/sex. 
So I came out at around 16.

The issues with not having grown that penis however stayed. They were more intense from time to time. Sometimes barely noticeable, sometimes really strong. 

It all came together when I was asked for my pronouns at an LGBTQ* get together on day and, for what felt like minutes, I stood there it didn’t know what to answer. 

My build is androgynous and I dress that way. Having people „misgender“ me fills me with immense joy. While on the other hand people addressing me as „Ms.“ or woman, sometimes even she/her is the opposite. It’s not horrible but it doesn’t feel good. 

I still pack in private from time to time and it feels so right. 
I don’t look in the mirror and feel intense dysphoria, instead by now it just feels like I managed to disconnect my mind from my body and go „That’s what it is.“. 


I don’t know why I am this way. I don’t know what to feel about it or who I am really. It’s confusing.
And I figured, that since I wouldn’t consider myself ftm that some anonymous people that know who they are in that regard, as in non binary, might be able to give advice.

But after puberty, I felt dysphoria creeping in. I really couldn't identify what I was experiencing at the time, but now it felt like staring into a forest and missing the trees, like denial. 

I had no idea what non-binary really was about, I could not understand it. I thought gender was a spectrum with male being on one side and female on the other, it didn't make any sense to be none of the above. I was always very supportive of LGBT+ people, I am bi myself so I am already LGBT+. But I was mislead by tons of misinformation and society's views of non-binary people. 

When I was around 18, I borrowed some of my boyfriend's clothes. I looked at myself and something happened. I felt like a chain of dominos falling. I got all these feelings I could not comprehend. I wanted to look like a boy more! I went shopping to by men's clothes. It was very emotional for me. I felt embarrassed with the male staff watching me take men's clothes in the fitting room. But I found clothes I like and I felt awesome!

I really don't think I'm trans. Because I love my feminine side and 95% of the time, I am overloading with femme. But I get the occasional dysphoria where I am my usual femme self and it just doesn't feel right. And other times I see super cute floral tops and I get excited. 

AAAGGGHHH, why can't I just be one or the other!? So confusing, my body feels like it keeps sending me mixed messages. Like every time I feel like I'm figuring things out, my brain is like ""sike, gotcha!""

I'm experimenting with being non-binary/gender fluid. I want to be girly sometimes, but be boyish other times. I like being ando other times. 

I work at a retail store and after my shift, I went to buy men's clothes. My coworker asked if they were for my boyfriend or for me, so I told the truth, that I like to dress male sometimes. She responded positively and told me that there is nothing wrong with that. My SO doesn't know yet.

I felt like a chain of dominos falling. I got all these feelings I could not comprehend. I wanted to look like a boy more! I went shopping to by men\'s clothes. It was very emotional for me.

689,2019-08-13 01:25:39,cplxe5,0,5,"Holy cow. This conversation I’ve just had, I’ve got so much energy from it.

I was explaining to her certain aspects of being trans, using my (openly) trans friend as an example and my mom just blurts out of nowhere “do you prefer to be called he?” And I was so taken aback! She never talks about me being pan or anything, I’ve always assumed she would just prefer to ignore it.

So I told her honestly “well no, I prefer they/them, and while I do consider myself trans, I want to be androgynous more than anything. That’s when I feel happiest with my body.”

She said she could kind of understand because for a long long time she was forced to be one religion while she truly believed she should be apart of another. She said she didn’t get it fully but if it was at all like her experience, then it made sense to her.

I told her I would like to see a therapist to talk about it, and to possible start T, and maybe even get top surgery, and she was so accepting?? It was amazing!

I think I'm mostly just looking for some support and to see if my story is similar to that of anyone else. 

I'm AFAB, in my 30s, and on the asexual spectrum, which I've known since I was a teenager although I didn't know there was a word for it until a few years ago. My ""style"" has bounced around a lot. I had a ""tomboy"" phase, a punk/goth phase, and since college, it's basically been jeans and t-shirts when not at work (which required a uniform). 

Anyways, I've always been big on feminism and equitable treatment, and over the years found myself getting more and more annoyed with just how unnecessarily gendered absolutely *everything* is and also uncomfortable with all this gendered stuff being applied to me. 

At some point during the last couple of years, I became aware of what nonbinary was and every few months would read a bunch about it. I found myself making an effort to use more and more neutral language, and also have found myself getting even more upset/uncomfortable with gendered language (and especially gendered insults). I really want to try using they/them pronouns and see how it feels. 

However, I'm okay with my gendered name, and I don't have any dysphoria in regards to my body (I mean...I wish some things were different, but that has to do with weight, not gender). I also like wearing makeup and I like my long hair, although I think it would be fun to mix up my professional wardrobe to incorporate more of a blend of styles (Billy Porter's tuxdress *spoke to me*). 

I'm also having a really hard time finding a nonbinary word that describes how I feel. I've been spending a lot of time on the nonbinary wiki and ""fuck it"" doesn't seem to be listed as a gender. Is enby as like a nebulous non-specific third gender considered a valid gender identity?

I was born (AMAB) on a Friday, the supposed day of the goddesses of queerness, sensuality, love, romance, art and magic. Goddesses such as Ezili Freda,Venus, Freya, Oshun, and more. 


Having this mythological appreciation for the day of my birth helped me make sense of my identity before I had the vocab to communicate who and what I am. It may seem weird but mythology served as a stand in for the absence of that vital language. Even now I find my nature better accounted for in the Nonbinary myths of deities such as Hermaphroditus. 


I was always considered feminine growing up, too ""empathetic"" and have always been a deeply sensual person with a love for poetry, and the subtleties of nature and life. Unfortunately my dad impulsively stamped his first name on me and I've been trying to find my true name ever since. Venera seems to come closest to that. In fact just saying it stirs up a genuine sense of joy. 


I am quite nervous about asking people to call me by new name, though. More specifically my family members. But the more I think about it the more I realise what I actually fear is being an inconvenience. That's no way to live.

767,2019-08-14 06:19:57,cq5qu2,0,1,"Beware wall of text.

First of all, hey all! I'm new to this sub but from what I've seen I already feel a bit comfortable talking about this in here. Also, my username is garbage and often associated with bigotry but I assure you it doesn't represent me, when I created it I didn't fully know it was associated with a intolerance. I wish I could change it but I'll probably end up deleting this account and creating another one.

I consult regularly with a psychiatrist because I have OCD, clinical depression and have recently been diagnosed with DID, which at first was suspected to be Schizophrenia because of some behavior patterns – I don't know how to explain the details but anyway. 

So, with that said I believe it's clear that there's some confusion in my mind. And that's not even half of it. Here comes the gender part: I don't really know how to describe myself. And my therapist won't be really helpful when it comes to gender identities because he said that's not his area of expertise. He said he could look into it and recommend me another psychiatrist but since he's been really helpful with everything else I refused for now.

For years I thought I was non-binary because I don't really mind being called a man or a woman. I dress, wear accessories and style my hair the way I like. Most of the time I'm very comfortable with having a penis, not having a vagina or breasts. But sometimes – I think this is where DID comes into – these things do bother me.

At first I thought I was just a cis boy with the curiosity of being a girl for a day to see what it feels like. That was years ago. As the years passed I started noticing that I've always been a mix of masculinity and femininity, since I was a child. Being bullied at school for doing some things deemed ""too feminine"" – and also because I'm bi/pan –, I started repressing this part of me but in my later teenage years I started not giving a damn about what others thought.

I then started viewing myself as a somewhat feminine man. But that wasn't true. Years later I found out about descriptions such as non-binary and it made much more sense than what I was thinking so far, yet I can't help but feel that's still not exactly what happens with my gender.

As I've expressed before, most of the time I'm really comfortable simply thinking of myself as a non-binary person who's often called a man with he/him pronouns and not feeling bad when I'm called a woman with she/her pronouns – even when it's meant to be derogatory – nor feeling bad about my genitals and stuff. But sometimes – it might sound really strange to some – I feel like a whole woman that's mostly attracted to women. And then I feel my penis and I start to feel uncomfortable for a while.

I don't know exactly how many personalities I have but these two are the easiest ones to identify: the non-binary person who might be a bit more inclined towards the male part of the spectrum and doesn't care about their genders, and the probably trans woman who experiences discomfort with her body, especially genitals.

I believe this might be trickier to understand than simply saying ""hey you're a lesbian trans girl"" or ""you're a bi/pan non-binary person"" because I have at least two distinct personalities. I'm aware of them most of the time and they might overlap, but sometimes I can't remember precisely what happened or how I was feeling.

If I had to be precise in saying when my second most common personality – the lesbian chick, that's how I usually refer to her – has clearly manifested itself I would guess it was in my early teens because of some memories I have, especially from what people told me. I was abused by a \~15 year old girl when I was 8 and this is probably when this personality first started to develop. I know, it sucks but really the abuse part is not an issue in my life anymore, I have learned to understand and accept it long ago to the point where I can proudly say I'm not ashamed of it – it used to make me extremely embarrassed when I talked about it and now it doesn't have a negative impact on me.

So there are a few questions that I would REALLY appreciate having an answer to. I'm currently looking for any help really, because I haven't found any similar story and am feeling lost and alone when it comes to it. I just ask you to please say if that's simply your opinion, if it's an educated guess or if you really know what you're talking about – sources would be nice but not needed. Here are most of the questions that currently bother me:

1. The ""main"" personality is what I've always felt as the ""real me"". I still call myself by my name given at birth when this one is taking over. But when the other personality starts to randomly show up I feel bad when I hear people call me by this name. Should I give her a name or something? Would this mess up even further or would it help me organize a little? I have thought about it but never really decided anything, the names Angela and Emilia came to mind and I have no clue why. My male name could easily be converted to female but for some reason I thought of these two.
2. How do I get people to understand this situation as quickly as possible? I mean, clearly I myself can't quite understand it and it's taking me a long time to explain what I know about it so far, so how do I come to make sure people will understand a bit of what's going on with my mind, gender and sexuality when this whole thing is becoming a huge chaos when I keep thinking and studying about it?
3. The lesbian chick is somewhat aggressive at times – really different from what my behavior is most of the time –, and can be mean to people I love like my mother, sister or my close friends. Sometimes I'm aware of it and I keep thinking ""apologize now, apologize right now, say you didn't mean it"" but I just can't or the apology only comes a few moments after when my main personality starts to assume ""control"". Sometimes I only know what I did wrong when someone tells me or reminds me of it. Is there a way I can mitigate this aggressive behavior and make all of my personalities AT LEAST have kindness in common?
4. How the hell should I present myself? Both IRL and online.
5. Is there anything I can do to try and help myself instead of always depending on a psychiatrist? If anyone who's a professional and works with cases like these could give me insight about this question that would be even better.

Years later I found out about descriptions such as non-binary and it made much more sense than what I was thinking so far, yet I can\'t help but feel that\'s still not exactly what happens with my gender.\n\nAs I\'ve expressed before, most of the time I\'m really comfortable simply thinking of myself as a non-binary person who\'s often called a man with he/him pronouns and not feeling bad when I\'m called a woman with she/her pronouns – even when it\'s meant to be derogatory – nor feeling bad about my genitals and stuff. But sometimes – it might sound really strange to some – I feel like a whole woman that\'s mostly attracted to women. And then I feel my penis and I start to feel uncomfortable for a while.\n\nI don\'t know exactly how many personalities I have but these two are the easiest ones to identify: the non-binary person who might be a bit more inclined towards the male part of the spectrum and doesn\'t care about their genders, and the probably trans woman who experiences discomfort with her body, especially genitals.\n\nI believe this might be trickier to understand than simply saying ""hey you\'re a lesbian trans girl"" or ""you\'re a bi/pan non-binary person"" because I have at least two distinct personalities. I\'m aware of them most of the time and they might overlap, but sometimes I can\'t remember precisely what happened or how I was feeling.\n\nIf I had to be precise in saying when my second most common personality – the lesbian chick, that\'s how I usually refer to her – has clearly manifested itself I would guess it was in my early teens because of some memories I have, especially from what people told me. I was abused by a \\~15 year old girl when I was 8 and this is probably when this personality first started to develop. I know, it sucks but really the abuse part is not an issue in my life anymore, I have learned to understand and accept it long ago to the point where I can proudly say I\'m not ashamed of it – it used to make me extremely embarrassed when I talked about it and now it doesn\'t have a negative impact on me.\n\nSo there are a few questions that I would REALLY appreciate having an answer to. I\'m currently looking for any help really, because I haven\'t found any similar story and am feeling lost and alone when it comes to it. I just ask you to please say if that\'s simply your opinion, if it\'s an educated guess or if you really know what you\'re talking about – sources would be nice but not needed. Here are most of the questions that currently bother me:\n\n1. The ""main"" personality is what I\'ve always felt as the ""real me"". I still call myself by my name given at birth when this one is taking over. But when the other personality starts to randomly show up I feel bad when I hear people call me by this name. Should I give her a name or something? Would this mess up even further or would it help me organize a little? I have thought about it but never really decided anything, the names Angela and Emilia came to mind and I have no clue why. My male name could easily be converted to female but for some reason I thought of these two.\n2. How do I get people to understand this situation as quickly as possible? I mean, clearly I myself can\'t quite understand it and it\'s taking me a long time to explain what I know about it so far, so how do I come to make sure people will understand a bit of what\'s going on with my mind, gender and sexuality when this whole thing is becoming a huge chaos when I keep thinking and studying about it?\n3. The lesbian chick is somewhat aggressive at times – really different from what my behavior is most of the time –, and can be mean to people I love like my mother, sister or my close friends. Sometimes I\'m aware of it and I keep thinking ""apologize now, apologize right now, say you didn\'t mean it"" but I just can\'t or the apology only comes a few moments after when my main personality starts to assume ""control"". Sometimes I only know what I did wrong when someone tells me or reminds me of it. Is there a way I can mitigate this aggressive behavior and make all of my personalities AT LEAST have kindness in common?\n4. How the hell should I present myself? Both IRL and online.\n5. Is there anything I can do to try and help myself instead of always depending on a psychiatrist? If anyone who\'s a professional and works with cases like these could give me insight about this question that would be even better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this is all for now.

He came out as non-binary masc about 4 months ago and about 2 years ago, I came out and started hrt 7 months ago(she/her). We discuss pretty extensively about gender, social politics, capitalism, etc. and yesterday we came to a disagreement regarding gender.

His dysphoria from my understanding revolves around not being comfortable with his chest. He says his dysphoria is not too bad but he is considering a reduction. However, he feels like he will always be misgendered for having breasts, he does not want to medically transition, or top surgery, because he feels like doing so is counterproductive to tearing down gender and social constructs. He feels western beauty standards are essentially tied to white supremacy and gender is essentially tied to the patriarchy. He thinks transitioning is not natural, and thinks everybody would just be comfortable with their bodies if it weren't for the power dynamics that exist in the external capitalist framework. I wanted to respond by saying that I love him and understand where he's coming from, but gender is not JUST a social construct. Unfortunately, before I could say anything, he shut me off and told me not to touch him. 

I medically transitioned specifically because I KNOW and have known since my earliest memory that the neurological representation of my own body is binary female, but now I'm starting to feel like I'll always be inferior to cis women in his eyes because he thinks I'm doing this to navigate around the patriarchal definition of gender instead of fighting the system from within. I agree completely with the analysis of the situation he is in, but I don't think I have to be thrown under the bus like this. I still hold myself 100% accountable for all the privileges I had when I was pre-transition, and to some extent I still feel accountable for the current patriarchal structure, but I feel like at this point all I'm trying to do is stay alive. 

He's a rad feminist and has gotten skeptical at me before because I suggested I might want bottom surgery and I do complain my body dysphoria very often, but he doesn't think there's anything wrong with my body. Which is sweet, but it's not the point and just ughhhhhh I don't know what to say because even before we both came out, he would constantly yell at me over arbitrary things I did, that made me a ""man"". For example, ""You don't know how to wash my clothes correctly because you are a man"". Maybe it'll be fine, maybe I'm missing something.

So, me (gay/male) and my boyfriend (gay/non-binary?) have been together for about 6 months now, randomly at 6 in the morning two days ago they message me saying they go by a new name and are using they/them pronouns. This wasn't really a surprise as we have both kinda been questioning our genders and such. I've been questioning been never really looked into anything so I think I understand the concept of a deadname and some other really basic things, but I'm still not sure on some stuff.

I also don't know what to refer to them as, like obviously I'm not going to call them my boyfriend so what do I call them?

*Hello,   I am AFAB NB and currently in the process of transitioning. I am   wondering if it's bad to go back on the name you thought you wanted? I   started testing a new name to see if it fit me. It was a gender neutral   nick name from my childhood which I thought would work because a lot of   trans influencers seem to pick symbolic names like that. Problem is I   had a pretty terrible childhood and I get bummed out by being reminded   of the nick name. It was a terrible idea, I know. XD I was really lost   on figuring out a name and it was the first one that came to mind. I   have commitment issues and I think that is making me wig out about   finding a new name, but I know I need one because whenever people call   me the name given to me by my parents I get sad. Whenever people call me   the name I am trying out with some friends I get bummed out too!*

*I   have started just having people call me by my last name in anonymous   situations like at coffee shops and it is like lifeblood to be referred   to as because I have one of those weird last names that is also a name   (masculine). It feels really good to be called it. I am worried the  same  thing will happen with my last name though because lol it's my  dad's last name and I was the only one who had his name in my family and he  was  really abusive. So it's kind of weird in that it's an identifier  for me  but it feels good, but I am worried it won't down the road....*

*I   have this other name that I am thinking about that is more an isolated   thing that I am really not sure about either. It's just so different   than anything and I am worried it will be something I regret too. It   feels good sometimes but more than anything it feels really different.*

*I   guess what I am wondering is if it is bad to test out names before   committing to one? Or is that really frowned upon? Would it be ok if I   tried out these names and figured out which felt right first and go back   on the first name I tried that just reminds me of bad shit?

-I’m on the aro/ace spectrum
-I have haphephobia
-My haphephobia is set off by romantic touches

After coming out and getting permission from myself, the idea of kissing someone didn’t seem so repulsive and I didn’t feel physically sick when I imagined someone wrapping their arms around me and whispering “I love you, [newname].”

I realise that I’d mislabelled my dysphoria as ‘haphephobia’ for a few years (though I probably have a small amount of it, tbh).

I've been feeling really dysphoric lately, but the problem is... I'm not sure what I want to achieve with transitioning. 

There's things about my body I love: I have a voice that sounds relatively masculine but higher pitch. I've been told when I talk I sound more like the stereotypical ""gay lisp"" than a cis girl. My legs are relatively ""gender neutral"" looking. I have a perky butt and defined legs and I don't shave all the time so they kinda pass as ""vaguely masculine."" I'm mostly okay with my face. 

However, there are other things I'm dysphoric about. Even though I do love my voice, I know my pitch is just high enough to where it clocks me as female 100% of the time. I am really dysphoric about my chest, and I have purposefully been wearing sports bras and not showering for days without changing my bras so I don't have to see it. I'm 5'4, so i'd be excessively short for a man if I were to transition completely. I have small shoulders for a cis man, but average shoulders for a cis woman. Thankfully, I've been less dysphoric about my shoulders since I started working out. I don't feel excessively dysphoric about my face, but I've had some people tell me it looks masc because of my jawline, but feminine because of the cheekbones. 

Overall, I am ALWAYS gendered as female. Even when I wear unisex T-shirts, sweatpants, skinny jeans, converse, flip flops, etc. It sucks. I can never be seen as male. 

But I don't necessarily want to be a man? When I imagine myself as a man, my version of it is a skinny, stereotypically bisexual rockstar. I would have long hair, and wear makeup, and be tall and thin and vaguely muscular. I wouldn't have much body hair. I would be taller. My voice would be deeper. I can imagine if I were assigned male at birth, I would be the type to look ""early transfemme"" (long hair, makeup, painted nails, etc.) I'd look like a man that can easily be confused for a tall woman. 

T can't help me with this image. It can't make me grow a foot taller, or ultimately change my bone structure, or control the exact things I want to control. The thought of me having bottom-growth and body hair makes me feel gross. Part of me wants top surgery in the far future (I say that because my family is  transphobic and I'd rather bind than come out to them right now), but when I see other people's post-top surgery photos, I see gross scarring and black nipple grafts. I can see myself having horrible post-surgery blues upon getting it. But if I ever had breast cancer, I know I'd jump on a double mastectomy before you can say radiation. 

I guess at the end of the day, I just want to pass as either binary gender. I want to be gendered as male sometimes by total strangers or people who first meet me. Ideally, I would be they/them 24/7, but the world doesn't think that way yet, so gender confusion would be really damn nice in terms of validation.",NonBinary,Dysphoria is confusing af (TW: Dysphoria),1565998828.0,"{'created_utc': 1565973628, 'id': 'cr8xq0', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'Hello, I\'m like 95% sure I\'m nonbinary (they/them, 21), and assigned female at birth.

So, there is a dumb ""controversy"" regarding a character (not sure if I use plural here, sorry if I am mistaken in using singular) from the upcoming game Borderlands 3 which was """"revealed"""" (all their promo material was in accordance to this, but it did not stop bigots from claiming otherwise) to be non-binary. I found it nice because it was the character I was already going to use in the game, and it is neat to play as my first non-binary character ever in a videogame. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the wake of this, I thought how nice it is that two of my favorite characters in art are non-bi, the other being Taylor Masonfrom the show ""Billions"". I also came to a realization that it is about time to not mess up the pronouns anymore when it comes to then, and also that the issues they face can be really interesting from a storytelling point of view. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is why I wanted to hear what non-binary characters from all forms of art you do enjoy, be it in movies, games, comics, books etc, because simply reading the rules do not stick it to my brain cause I always had a hard time with grammar overall, and learned it out of practice instead of memorizing it. Since I am also a sucker for art in general and a wannabee writer, I am also interested in character variety, and that, of course, also applies to gender identity.

As a last note, I am truly sorry if I mistook the pronoun usage (would appreciate corrections if that was the case), and I could have posted this in other subreddits but I wanted to get the opinions of non-binary people specifically.

I spent a long time feeling really lost on how I wanted to present. As a nonbinary person with a neutral gender, I can't really ""pass"" as my gender the way a binary trans person might be able to. I loved feminine clothes, always have, but I am AFAB and felt like my appearance made me look both cis and straight. I didn't WANT that, I wanted to look ""gay"", but I wasn't sure how or in what way. 

And then I got my hair cut short again, after having it shoulder length for a long time. At first I was worried, because I realized the haircut looked really masculine/butch, more so than I had expected, and I was afraid the look would ""clash"" with my feminine clothes. But after a couple weeks of thinking, I realized that's exactly what I wanted! To mix and match gender! Masculine aspects and feminine aspects, all rolled into one.

I started combining feminine elements like dresses, pretty jewelry &amp; accessories, and my already feminine face, with more masculine things like visible body hair, my very short haircut, no makeup, and masculine looking jewelry and accessories - all mixed together in each outfit I wear. I've also been binding on some days and not binding on others, for some variety. 

This style really suits me and I've been feeling more confident and comfortable in my gender than I have in a long time! I definitely look gay af now, and I enjoy how confusing I must look to all the cisgenders (haha). I feel gender noncomforming in all sorts of ways and I love it.

To all of you who read my story, thank you! This is actually my first time posting on this subreddit; I don't know why but I just felt like sharing today. :)

I hate recommending books to people for such intimate issues because you are more than any book or word could ever contain. ""The eyes shame the page of any book, gesture destroys concept"" as one poet beautifully stated. However, a familiar story makes the world that you are a lot less lonely. That feeling of connection and belonging does wonders along the way.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Recommended books', 'created': 1566069350.0}"

First of all I am so happy this community exists and I love you all.

Sooooo I am AFAB and nonbinary, and I mostly present as femme.  I just feel like my truest, cutest self when I'm all dolled up in a dress and my hair curled and bright red lipstick. However, since I came out about a year or two ago, I've felt like I can't dress as feminine as I would like and I'm starting to notice it's negatively affecting my self-esteem. I love pink, and flowers, and all kinds of stereotypically femme shit, but I feel like because I'm AFAB and I like to ""look like a girl"" (whatever tf that means) I might as well just be cis. Does that make any sense??

(throwaway for obvious reasons - half of this is a rant but feel free to comment on whatever)

I recently came to terms with the fact I am most probably non-binary. I've been very comfortable being masc my entire life, however, recently I've had the opportunity to explore presenting in a less-than-masc way, and I've found it extremely comforting and empowering. Also, I asked a few of my friends to use they/them when referring to me, and it has been absolutely incredibly empowering.

I'm torn however, because I feel like I'm not ""femme-enough"" in action/presentation to even consider myself to be non-binary, and thanks to the wonderful gift(?) of testosterone, I have a very masc body (lots of upper torso hair i'm not too fond of, and some leg hair I'm absolutely chill with). On the other hand, however, I would love to wear a cute af crop-top (or tee shirt) and a skirt out and about. (I'm also not too wild on growing out my hair a lot because that's a lot to take care of, and I don't think I have time to do it). 

So, I dunno. Is anyone else here more of a masc amab person, and is that even a thing? Do any of y'all have tips on dressing more femme (especially when you have body image issues as it is)?

- he totally respected non binary identity :D I didn’t feel I had to pretend to be more masc or more binary than I am at all (I am femme trans masc/non binary. I don’t know at this point how far I want to go with physical masculinisation but I am pretty sure I want most of the changes that will come in the first few months of T at least)
- if my bloods are okay and GP agrees, I can go on low dose T. He suggested a gel which I wasn’t keen on initially but it allows you to control the dose and get a more stable T level, which I think will be better for me than injections to start with.
- I am 31 and have spent some time seeing a therapist and getting my life relatively stable, I think this helped as firstly a lot of his questions are around what support you have in place, and also having already worked through things allowed me to stay calm and felt like I knew the answers during the assessment
- I am out and have changed name socially but not on ID or by deedpoll yet, he was fine with that but suggested deedpoll as a next step
- I paid privately for the appointment with him, hopefully (!!) will get blood tests and prescription via GP but I might have to pay for first prescription.

I'm only 5'2 but have broad shoulders, large muscles, and a thick torso. I'm much heavier than I look and have always hated that. I've been working with a therapist for years but I could never quiet the voice in my head that said that my body should look a certain way. I came out as a lesbian about a year ago, and that helped some, but I was still judging myself for not having ”the perfect female body”.

About 6 weeks ago I started a new job that includes lots of travel and time on construction sites. I quickly found that husky boys cargo pants, boxer briefs, and golf-style shirts over a sports bra was my best bet for site visits in 102F heat. 

So, for the past month I've been wearing boys clothes almost exclusively and eating in restaurants and on the go a lot due to the travel. I've gained nearly 10lbs and somehow I'm ok with that? I'm actually starting to enjoy finishing off restaurant meals and following up with dessert. Mid-afternoon snack with the Gatorade I picked up at the c-store? The company is paying, so why not? 

Previously, weight fluctuations of just 2-3lbs would cause panic and relapse into disordered eating. But now? It's like that voice has completely disappeared. I honestly don't know what is going. 

I think that wearing boys clothes (and having them fit more comfortably than my women's stuff) has shifted my thinking. There was never anything wrong with my body, I was just trying to make it fit into the wrong clothes.

I have so much clothing anxiety so I normally just wear jean's and a shirt or sweater and just give up. I've tried to actually make a wardrobe that works for me but I always fail. Either I get over whelmed and anxious thinking about it or I just get stuck because I cant find anywhere that has clothing my size that isnt super cheap quality or baggy work/outdoors clothing. I've tried fast fashion sites like h&amp;m and asos but they still had a super limited selection for me and the clothes I did get shrunk so bad I had to give them away.

Does anyone know where someone like me can shop? I've accepted that clothes for me wont be cheap but I'm still working on somewhat of a budget. Anywhere I could get an outfit or two (not counting shoes) for like $250 or cheaper would be amaizing.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there,

A lot has changed for me in the past year. After four-ish years living as a binary trans woman (having bottom surgery too), I decided to open up to my nonbinary side and use they/them pronouns in the spring. Which has been so positive and so powerful! For lots of reasons! I feel like my transition(s), such that they are, have been about finding my way back to a sense of belonging/home/safety in my body, in my way of relating to others, in my expressiveness, and especially with what I want to \*do\* with myself and my life.

And now that I'm a little deeper into nonbinary life, I am figuring out what making a home in nonbinary-ness truly means for me. I'm figuring it out as I go - shaved my head, switched over to minimal/sports bras under collared shirts, let my voice drop a bit, etc. - and though I'm not like adopting classic like stone butch style, I am really enjoying finding softness in the context of a queer-coded-mascness (e.g. bright lipstick but with sharp collared top and clothes). However, there are a few things that I am still sort of out to sea about, and it would be helpful to hear any thoughts you have:

1. Chest dysphoria. I never really enjoyed the new experience of having breasts, and more recently realized that I also don't really want them touched. I think I would strongly consider, in the medium future, top surgery. They are pretty modestly sized or whatever (small side of B if that). But I'm actually not sure - can I have top surgery and stay on E (I no longer take progsterone, and I don't need andro blockers post-surgery)? Would there continue to be breast tissue regrowth? What if I waited until the equivalent of a cis puberty cycle, so another two or three years?

2. Hormones generally. I really like mentally being on E, I like having a female body/softness/smell with a nonbinary masc-ish presentation. That all works for me. But are there any benefits or options for more nonbinary hormone combinations? I'm less familiar with this all. I could never grow much facial hair, and I've done laser and plucked a lot in the past, so that all wouldn't come back, which is kind of ironic as I wouldn't mind it at all at this point.

3. Dating. What should I expect? Any tips/ideas? I am attracted to folks across genders and presentations, although recent experience definitely suggests that I'd be very happy dating a more femme partner, especially trans women. I worry about somebody not seeing me for the nonbinary queer that I am, so I guess like communication is a bit stressful in that way if that makes sense. Also, I am not unilaterally like a butch stereotype by ANY means, and I'm a softy and weirdo in my way too. I am excited to date as like, more of a (service) top, and express that confidence and care in various ways, fwiw :p

(I searched the archive before posting, but just when I thought I had my answer, I found myself further confused.)

Yesterday I was summarizing a new york Times article for my 11 year old son (he still identified as a boy at the time) about the older members of his generation (teenagers, early 20s) transcending gender. What I picked up from the article, and what I tried to tell him, is that there are lots of people who don't feel like a boy or a girl so they call themselves non binary. But there are also people who identify as non binary because they don't believe gender to be an either/or. These people never felt particularly conflicted with how society gendered them, but they use the label to promote the idea that everyone has both ""traditionally masc"" and ""traditionally fem"" traits. My kid responded to this second part by declaring themself to be nb. I asked about pronouns and their answer was they/ them... After a pause they added that I should use ""he/him"" when talking to their dad (my asshole ex who strives to be as ""normal"" as possible) or anyone who knows my kid. They were at their dads house today and started texting me questions like whether LGBTQ+ includes nb and what is gender queer. I tried to answer by talking about the difference between gender and attraction, but ultimately asked to postpone the conversation till tomorrow when we can have it in person. 

I don't believe my kid has ever felt conflicted about gender. In the past they've gotten a pedicure with me and for a year or two said pink was their favorite color. However, I believe that came from a place of wanting to rebel against society (or possibly against their dad), because I have the same trait of wanting to go against people who just want to keep up appearances.

So what did I mess up? I'm sure I could have done better but I'm fairly new to understanding the concept of non binary.

Tldr: I'm scared I gave my kid bad info when I explained that some enbys have never felt dysphoric about gender. Now my kid says they are enby. Fine with me, but what if they are basing their identity on my misunderstanding of this stuff???  Please correct me so I don't cause them any unnecessary grief.

1170,2019-08-21 01:30:40,ct9rcp,3,14,"Hello everyone,

I am 33 years old, and camab. Over the past few months, I have come to accept and understand myself as non-binary, and I would like to ask for some help, any help, with regard to my dysphoria, but before I get to that, I'd like to give a little background and explain why it took 33 years for not only to come to terms with it all, but to even conceptualize it in the first place.

So from a very young age, I have felt very different, but I always had trouble telling what exactly it was about me that made me feel so different. I had essentially all the privileges: white, ""male"", intelligent, comfortable socioeconomic status. I could never understand why I felt so off, I was never bullied at school or in my neighborhood, and I had supportive and well-meaning parents. I latched on to various groups, always being accepted but never really feeling like I fit in anywhere. I tried the geeks, I tried the stoners, none of it worked. After I started working, I met a lot of LGBT people, and began to wonder if I fit in with them. I felt a very tight bond with them, but this made no sense to me, because I had always been romantically and sexually attracted to women. So, eventually I gave up on that community, as I had so many others before.

Growing up, I never had a problem making friends, but I had a lot of difficulty with romantic relationships. I came up with a million rationalizations, that I was shy, that I was unlucky, that I was too picky, but suffice it to say that things happened at a rather slow pace. My first kiss was at 20, and I had sex for the first time at 25. A few years ago, however, I met my ex, and the first year of the relationship was absolutely wonderful. Her friends were almost all LGBT, and I felt really in my skin with all of them. This was when I was really introduced to ideas of gender, feminism, and so on. However, discussion still mostly focused on binaries, and after some time the relationship began to erode. Things got complicated emotionally, and because of this I began to unconsciously avoid sex, and to go through erectile dysfunction an uncomfortable number of times. A lot of questions were ~~shouted~~ asked about who was attracted to which gender, and so on. Eventually, we broke up, and I won't go through all the drama, but the core reason why the relationship didn't work was that we both wanted to occupy the same space in the relationship, the typically-female space.

Obviously, this made me even more confused. How can someone want to occupy a female space in a relationship, but a male space in sex? How can someone want to be pampered and told they're beautiful, but find no pleasure in being penetrated during sex? Fortunately, after a hefty dose of Drag Race and Queer Eye, and thanks to an absolutely amazing therapist, the cognitive dissonance subsided, I came to understand that I am in fact non-binary and that there is a Q after LGBT and that it's not just for Miley Cyrus. I finally came out to my sister last Sunday.

The reason that it took me so long to figure this all out is that I didn't even know it was possible to be who I am, an amab non-binary who is attracted to women (or as my sister put it, a lesbian who took a wrong turn before being born). Now my whole life makes sense to me, and though I still have a lot to figure out in terms of expressing myself and how I present, I finally feel like I can shed my ""shadow cloak"" and be beautiful and fabulous. And this brings me to the issue at hand, which is my dysphoria.

From the neck down, I have absolutely no problem with my body. I'm totally fine with my penis, and my legs are like my best feature. My body hair doesn't bother me, and I don't feel any need to have breasts or a vagina. From the neck up, however, things get a little complicated. My facial hair is fine, in the sense that I can just grow it or shave it as I see fit. The big deal is my hair, or lack thereof. You see, I come from a long line of bald men, and by the time I turned 18, things started to go downhill fast, and when I was around 22 or 23 I had the full Franciscan monk look, as my grandmother likes to say.

Until I was 17, I was frankly gorg. Of course, I couldn't see myself as pretty, because I was a ""man"", but the point is I felt fine with my looks. But as the baldness started setting in, I started to feel more and more dysphoric (although obviously at the time I didn't have a word for it, just a very persistent feeling). And it was odd, because I didn't think it made me look ugly or anything, just...weird. Not me. Now I get that it's because it makes me look waaaay more masculine that I would care for, and it's driving me kind of nuts. Although people do many different things when they want to present masculine, few things are as male-associated as (natural) baldness. Even medically: the hair usually falls off due to high levels of testosterone.

But I am not male, and I don't want to present male. What I don't know, however, is how to deal with it. I am unable to shave off my beard, even though I would like to, because if I did I would look either like a giant baby or a skinhead. I'm also very reluctant about wearing wigs or hats because heating up my head is guaranteed to trigger a migraine. I'm even reluctant to wear more fem clothing because it would cause such a massive case of dissonance with my bald head. Further, I tried finasteride when I was younger, but it did absolutely nothing, and I don't intend to go on HRT for the foreseeable future. Which leaves me with a grand total of one option: freaking out because I wish so, so bad that I had the same beautiful, gorgeous, flowy hair that I had when I was 17, and all I see when I look in the mirror is a stranger.

If you've stuck with me for this long, thank you, truly. Just being listened to is so important for me. If you, however, have some advice for how to deal with this, I would really, really appreciate it. There's something that all the gender-neutral clothes, piercings, jewelry and make-up in the world can't make up for, and I don't know what to do about it. I'm going to an LGBTQ-friendly barber in a couple of weeks, and she's going to do what she can to demasculinize my face, but if anyone out there has a tip, or a recommendation, or knows about someone who talks about these issues, that would be incredible. But even if all you can offer is a word of encouragement, believe me, it's worth its weight in gold.

1210,2019-08-21 17:42:24,ctk8mi,7,3,"Hello! I am afab, asexual, demiromantic... and possibly some shade of genderqueer? I don't know if I'm nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or just a girl who likes bowties. I wanted to share a bit of my story, though, and see if it rings bells for you guys.

To start off, I'm perfectly fine with people calling me ""she/her."" That feels like part of my identity. Whenever someone misgenders me and calls me ""he/him,"" though, I get very happy. Although it's awkward, I also like when people have to ask me whether I'm a boy or a girl. The only dysphoria I've had in my life was about my hair. I had butt-length hair growing up (my parents wouldn't let me cut it) and I HATED it. Like, I never learned how to braid it or put it into a ponytail because I just hated touching the stuff. The second I moved out of the house I got a pixie cut and felt way better. Another thing that stands out is that I love men's clothing. Like, I've just worn regular non-girly clothes for most of my life, but I drool over well-dressed men (in a nonsexual, nonromantic way) and have specialized as a seamstress in sewing formal menswear. I even sewed my husband's waistcoat for our wedding. I went through a two-year period in college where I dressed ""like a lesbian"" --  skirts with suspenders and bowties -- and I liked that. Now that I don't go to church anymore and don't have to wear skirts, I find myself wanting to wear buttondowns, waistcoats, slacks, and Oxfords on formal days (I still basically wear graphic tees and shorts most days).

The asexual thing complicates the issue a bit, because I am undeniably attracted to spunky androgynous girls and nonbinary people. I'm pretty sure it's just aesthetic attraction? Mixed with a ""I want to look like that"" feeling? Idk, but I can't look away. My husband is the only person I've ever been romantically attracted to, and he's cis male. Add to that that people on here talk about ""bottom growth"" and that seems pretty good to me, but on they other hand who cares because I'm asexual anyways?

I'm a cosplayer, and generally in the past I've been okay to be a female who just dresses up as males (always) for conventions. Crossplay has kept me feeling good. Lately, though, I want to go into the men's restroom when I want to and let people call me ""he"" if they want to without confusing my family.

The thing that has always bothered me the most was the certainty of others. Everyone else is so sure about who and what you are. Hauntingly certain. Imagine if picking up a few items at some shop gave a stranger the right to enter your home; to leap back in fear or plunge forth in rage when you’ve knocked something over. You know you’re not a ghost. You know you’ve been violated. You know their items don’t belong there. But they’ve been made to believe deep in their bones that their anger is justified, and that their fear is as valid as the quickening of their breath. That they have the right to reduce you to splinters in your own home. A home you haven't even fully explored. To perceive yourself as clearly as you feel is nearly impossible under those conditions. Society likes to treat its Genderqueer population as if we were anomalies. 

As if we're plagued by some fever that compromises our clarity, but that couldn't be any more further from the truth. In reality every GQ/NB person you encounter is usually living their life trying to be sane enough for an entire city or town and, sometimes an entire nation or country. Our clarity is not compromised. On the contrary its been augmented by circumstance. What was initially an inner experience has evolved into a raft for others amid an already discouraging situation. In almost every interaction we're essentially carrying others inside the depths of our identity from one point of possibility to another. When and how we do it is irrelevant. Some of us do it while dancing. Some of us do it with a stoic silence. Some of us do it while bursting with color. But seeing it done is always an unmistakable event of grace amid the prevailing chaos.

I came out in around 2015ish when I found what gender dysphoria was and what trans was. I related to both of the defintions. I came out as genderfluid, then demiboy, and then binary trans man back to just nonbinary. 

My family wasn’t.... accepting at all about my transition until around 2017ish. Two years, almost. My dad told me would never called me [redacted]. I was possibly, almost sent to conversion therapy by my grandparents claiming that I needed “help”. 

I thought I would never get my first binder. My name changed. My pronouns respected. Tesestrone. Surgery. Or that there would even be an option for that. That I could be respected and be me. 

Now? Now, I’ve gone to pride for the first time in Washington D.C. We came late due to traffic and not knowing where to go but even a glimpse of it was amazing. I felt whole. There were other people out and proud and I was even *with* them. I saw my future right then and there. I’m even going to the pride in Richmond Virginia in September. 

Now, I have my name changed. I’m officially [redacted]. This is the first year of high school I won’t have to “my last name is [redacted] but I go by [redacted]. They’ll look at the paper and go, “is [redacted] here?” There won’t be an awkward stares or asking why I go by a totally different name. My name won’t appear differently on my computer and be different in the system. I’ll walk into high school, my senior year, first thing on Monday and feel proud of myself. Of the accomplishment that I made at this school. 

Now, I’ve had three chest binders from GC2B and even getting the rainbow one tommorow. Now, I’m able to have a flat chest and be able to not worry about my chest for one second. 

Now, my pronouns are respected even though, one time four months ago, I thought I was cis. Now, people are using he/they and seeing me as he/they and I’m not getting rude comments about me being trans. I’m accepted even to those who may not understand. 

Now, people at church are coming to me telling me there stories about being lgbtq+ . Now, my mom is standing up for herself when some people from church ask her “morals” because she posted pride pictures. She told me, she isn’t going to be closeted about supporting me. She’s going to support her, son. I’m her son.  My dad? Now, he calls me [redacted]. Now, he corrects himself whenever he makes mistakes. Now, he calls me sir, his son, a boy. 

My family is even more accepting now then they ever had been. My mom told me if I always want to be called he/they she would call me he/they. 

Now, my moms friends family kids are seeing me as “one of the boys”. I’m one of the boys. 

I’m not saying all this to brag, I’m saying this, for those who are young and not yet visible, that you will be visible one day. I promise. Your fight isn’t over and you will be heard. Even those, who aren’t young, you will be able to out and loud, I promise you.

My name is Logan and I am a researcher at UC Santa Cruz. We are conducting a study on the relationship between participation in online communities and well-being for transgender people (including non-binary and genderqueer people who identify as trans). I identify as non-binary trans myself, and my hope is that this research can lead to a better understanding of how online trans communities can enhance well-being.

I am sharing the survey here for anyone who would like to participate. Participation is voluntary, your answers will be kept confidential, and you can stop the survey at any time. The survey is expected to take approximately 15 minutes.

Participants must:
-	Be 18+
-	Currently reside in the US
-	Identify as transgender

*We are especially interested in the experiences of trans people who are over 40, trans people of color, and trans people who identify as having a disability*

You can participate by visiting the following site: 
https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6sB83SDneSZ3yCh

If you have any questions, please reach out to me at lbarsigi@ucsc.edu.

I am planning to come out to my parents soon over email, and I just wrote a draft of this letter. They are accepting at heart, but completely ignorant about transness in general. When i came out to them as bi a few years ago (loll, when I thought I was a cis bi man, I was so wrong), they were initially completely ignorant about the whole thing in pretty hurtful way, but have now come around to it and are fine.

If anyone has some feedback, let me know! Do you think this communicates my point? Do you think it will make sense to my cis, trans-ignorant parents?

Thanks!!

\---------------------------------

Dear Mom and Dad,

Please read this entire message before doing anything, such as contacting me. 

I have something I need to tell you: I am nonbinary.

Nonbinary, as in, I no longer identify as a man. I am transgender, but not a trans woman either. I am nonbinary because my gender does not fit into the gender binary of male and female.

Before I go any further, I’ll try to define some terms that might help you understand the language I will use to talk about my gender. 

Nonbinary is a label for any gender identity that is not completely male, or completely female. Nonbinary is an umbrella term encompassing many more specific labels—such as genderfluid and agender—but it is also used as an identity on its own, by many people who don’t have a more specific label they feel fits their gender.

Transgender is a label for any person who identifies as a gender that is not their assigned gender at birth. (Assigned gender at birth is the trans approved way to communicate ""biological sex""). Not all transgender people are nonbinary, but all nonbinary people are technically transgender according to this definition.

I am nonbinary and transgender. 

I have know and accepted this identity for a while, but I have been extremely unwilling to come out to you both about it in any way, until very recently. However I am now at a place with my gender identity that I can’t go any longer hiding this from you without feeling completely ingenue in our relationship, and incurring significant damage to my mental health. This is because I am finally starting to express myself in my daily life in a way that feels so much more true to who I am than pretending to be a cis man ever has. I absolutely cannot come home and pretend this isn’t a thing, and hide this from you; it simply will not work. This is a very real part of my identity, and you need to know about it now.

You might be wondering, what do I mean that I am starting to express myself in a more genuine way? Well, a more precise way of saying this is that I have made/am making changes to my presentation so that my gender expression is more aligned with my gender identity. This means, I have been wearing different types of clothes (and by different type, I mean women’s). I have been asking people to use they/them pronouns for me. I have been coming out to the people around me so that they will affirm my identity. etc.

I am coming out to you now because staying in the closet is simply not an option for me. Honestly, living at home during august was extremely difficult at times for me. One big part of many people’s trans experiences is *gender dysphoria*. Here is a medical description of gender dysphoria: [https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) (the definition sections of this page also contains useful information). Gender dysphoria is extremely distressing, and for me being expected to act like a cis man triggers it significantly, making me feel like shit. Living at home during August this summer was really hard because if you don’t know about my transness, and I have to pretend to be cis around you, it makes me feel awful and is very unhealthy. This is my completely real experience; coming out to you now and being able to express my true self around you has direct, tangible consequences for me and my mental health. 

This brings me to my final point of this letter. I understand you are probably very confused by all this; I know you don’t know much about trans identities, from past conversations we’ve had, and the first time I came out to you as any type of queer you were pretty shocked. I am be happy to answer your questions about my nonbinary identity, so that you can understand it better. However, I will not tolerate you questioning the very nature of my gender identity. This is real, it is not a phase, and you need to accept that. I am happy to answer your well intended questions, but I am not at all opening myself up to a dialogue where I have to defend myself from your doubts. 

I am doing this over email because I am honestly terrified of your reaction. If you react to this in a negative way, it will be extremely upsetting and hurtful, and it will have a lasting impact on my ability and willingness to trust you with any emotional content about my life. This is not about you, or your future grandchildren, or your ideas about what my life will be like. I am not sharing this with you for anything having to do with you; I am telling you this because I need your support on this journey, and I want to be able to express my true self around the people that matter most to me: my family.

That being said, I am really doing this over email so that you can have whatever initial reaction you are going to have, without me seeing it. Please, do not contact me until you have had sufficient time to think this over so that you can react positively to me.

Are there any good sites for buying masc clothing that will fit someone with large breasts?

Context: I developed breasts pretty early and by the time I was 15 I had an E-cup, and currently I sport an H-cup. I wouldn't call it dysphoria but for most of my teens I was pretty uncomfortable with how prominent they made my femaleness. I questioned my gender on and off for most of my teens but at the time I only knew that you were either ""normal"" or you transitioned fully to the ""opposite"" gender (quotation marks to show my ignorance at the time since I now know this phrasing is totally bs) and I always knew that I wouldn't be happier as a man than I was as a woman. Over time though most of this faded away and I sort of grew comfortable with being a woman.

1416,2019-08-25 17:54:12,cvbqcf,6,11,"I decided I wanted a men's suit for my best friend's wedding that is coming up in October. My other friend who is also AFAB enby went with me, which was awesome 'cause I was already nervous about how the salesmen would react to me wanting menswear.

\***TL;DR** to skip

Our first stop was to Men's Wearhouse. Yes, our salesperson was a little like, ""Uh...okay..."" when we told him we both wanted men's suits and we didn't know where to start. But he kept it professional and helped walk us through the process. He kept calling us ""she's"" and thought that we were a couple, but overall he was really trying his best to be respectful and answer all our questions. He took our chest measurements. We were both wearing binders. We tried on some jackets so he could see how they fit on us and if we looked best in slim or modern fit. (Modern fit is more boxier in the torso. For me, as an average size female-bodied person, the modern fit looked a little frumpy. I was strongly advised to do slim fit.)

**-Option A:** Buy a suit off the hanger (about 300-400 US dollars) and then pay extra to have it tailored. ALL of the ready-made suits came in the American style which features two front buttons, long V-shaped lapels, and two vents in the back of the jacket (these vents or slits kind of sit over your butt and can help minimize the booty). The pants are pretty straight relaxed fit. Color options were mostly navy blues, blacks, and greys. European style suits were not even an option.

Uh...okay that option is great if you have a male physique. I'm not broad enough in the shoulders to fit even a rather small, slim fit jacket. And apparently, it is very difficult (some stores won't do it at all) to take the shoulder seam and padding in. Because I could not fill out the shoulders, the upper back and neck area of the jacket would create a fold or crease. It didn't bother *me* that much, but every male opinion seemed to be that the jacket didn't fit right. And to be fair, their job is to make sure I look my best and it fits me super well. So off the hanger wasn't my best option.

**-Option B:** Get a custom suit. With this option, I was able to pick out the fabric I wanted and also the lining for the jacket. I'll be honest...I was disappointed with the variety. The basic suit fabrics were pretty bland. And the really nice, fun lining prints (skulls, flowers, occasion prints) were in a separate, more expensive section. I realize most men want a basic suit that will get them through many occasions considering how much they pay for it. But I really thought they'd have some fun, creative fabrics.

If we decided to go this route, all of our measurements would be taken, we could choose from some different lapel types for the jacket and for the vest, and we would be able to come in for a final fitting in 4-5 weeks or so. From there we could do small adjustments if necessary. Once you purchase a suit, you get free alterations FOR LIFE. (This is great to know for those who want to be or are on T or are waiting for surgery. As your body changes, you'd still be able to keep the suit you like and tweak it to fit your new body.) For an AFAB person, this clearly IS the better option. However, I am not made of money and because my need for a suit currently fits only one occasion (I don't need a suit for business or work), it was a bit much for me to spend when I'd only wear it maybe a few times.

So I asked how much a custom jacket would be, without the pants or vest. It starts at $675 or so.

Just the custom vest and pant? About $450 to start.

A entirely custom suit? Probably over $1000.

That was out of my price range. But at least I got a lot of my questions answered and got to try some things on.

So we went to check out K&amp;G Fashion Superstore. This store had a bunch of ready-made suits. And even when I found one that fit me in the chest and was more snug in the waist, it was still too broad in the shoulders and I was told that this could not be tailored. However, the suits here were significantly cheaper, somewhere between $150 and $200 for most of them (this usually only included a jacket and pant. SOME came with a vest as well). Shortening the sleeves cost about $18. Much much more affordable. But they all came in the same basic greys, blacks or blues.

But, that store had a LOT of really awesome accessories. Bow ties, neck ties, kits that included: suspenders, bow tie, pocket square all in one, and lots and lots of other tie colors and options with fun prints too! 

Because I wasn't willing to spend that much money for something that wasn't going to fit me well enough, I ended up at the mall in a store called Uniqlo, and bought a much more casual pant and matching jacket for about $100. I was able to find an extra small jacket that *actually* fit me in the shoulder. For those that don't know this store, it is a Japanese clothing company that makes pretty basic items at very affordable prices. So, because the sizes generally come smaller, I was able to fit much better into men's clothes. I also found socks to match my button-up shirt!

\***TL;DR** So. Let me go over the key points here:

\-Go to a place like Men's Wearhouse, if only to get your measurements taken and to try on different fits so you can get an idea of your size and what looks good on you. Wear whatever undergarments (binder, etc.) you plan on wearing so that your measurements will come out accurately. 

\-You can try to find a ready-made suit either at a superstore or maybe a thrift store and have it altered. This will probably be the more cost-effective strategy.

\-Stores like Nordstrom or Macy's seem to carry the same basic American suit style in the SAME colors for *quite* the price mark-up.

\-You could order a suit from custom websites that cater to AFAB and trans bodies. But these tend to be pricey and you don't get the in-person consultation that you would at a brick-and-mortar store.

\-You can get a completely custom suit with free alterations for life at Men's Wearhouse. This is a great option if you truly plan on utilizing it a lot and are concerned that as your body changes, your suit may have to change with you too.

I hope this information helps someone! I sure learned a lot just talking to sales reps. Bring a buddy if you're nervous. Yes we got strange looks but in the end, people were very willing to give us tips and information.",NonBinary,My AFAB adventures of men's suit shopping,1566780852.0,"{'created_utc': 1566755652, 'id': 'cvbqcf', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 11, 'selftext': 'I decided I wanted a men\'s suit for my best friend\'s wedding that is coming up in October. My other friend who is also AFAB enby went with me, which was awesome \'cause I was already nervous about how the salesmen would react to me wanting menswear.\n\n\\***TL;DR** to skip\n\nOur first stop was to Men\'s Wearhouse. Yes, our salesperson was a little like, ""Uh...okay..."" when we told him we both wanted men\'s suits and we didn\'t know where to start. But he kept it professional and helped walk us through the process. He kept calling us ""she\'s"" and thought that we were a couple, but overall he was really trying his best to be respectful and answer all our questions. He took our chest measurements. We were both wearing binders. We tried on some jackets so he could see how they fit on us and if we looked best in slim or modern fit. (Modern fit is more boxier in the torso. For me, as an average size female-bodied person, the modern fit looked a little frumpy. I was strongly advised to do slim fit.)\n\n**-Option A:** Buy a suit off the hanger (about 300-400 US dollars) and then pay extra to have it tailored. ALL of the ready-made suits came in the American style which features two front buttons, long V-shaped lapels, and two vents in the back of the jacket (these vents or slits kind of sit over your butt and can help minimize the booty). The pants are pretty straight relaxed fit. Color options were mostly navy blues, blacks, and greys. European style suits were not even an option.\n\nUh...okay that option is great if you have a male physique. I\'m not broad enough in the shoulders to fit even a rather small, slim fit jacket. And apparently, it is very difficult (some stores won\'t do it at all) to take the shoulder seam and padding in. Because I could not fill out the shoulders, the upper back and neck area of the jacket would create a fold or crease. It didn\'t bother *me* that much, but every male opinion seemed to be that the jacket didn\'t fit right. And to be fair, their job is to make sure I look my best and it fits me super well. So off the hanger wasn\'t my best option.\n\n**-Option B:** Get a custom suit. With this option, I was able to pick out the fabric I wanted and also the lining for the jacket. I\'ll be honest...I was disappointed with the variety. The basic suit fabrics were pretty bland. And the really nice, fun lining prints (skulls, flowers, occasion prints) were in a separate, more expensive section.

I came out to my parents a little over a year ago, as they were coming to my senior exhibition and graduation, but they never really acknowledged it, saying it was too hard to change how they thought of me, but supported me anyways. They never said a word to anyone else in my family, and are quite whenever I mention anything about LGBT at extended family outings. My mother is terrified of me getting top surgery, which has been my major life goal for 10 years, and keeps begging me to get a reduction instead, and freaks out whenever I mention my research on low-dosing T.

The biggest problem I have (aside from being called by the wrong name and being misgendered, which happens at work anyways despite my pronoun pin and never even introducing myself at all in relation to my dead name) is that my family loves to buy me clothes. Any chance for giving a gift involves clothes. I have no idea why, I have never been able to steer them away from it.

Now, I've had a fairly established, masculine looking aesthetic they've all seen for a very long time. I've openly worn a binder for years. They used to be pretty good about getting me clothes it looked like I would wear: neutral stuff, or more kind of masculine clothes.
Since I've come out to my mother, that's all flipped. Its a CONSTANT barrage of items I literally can't put on without crying. Lacy things, peplums, colors I never touch, plunging necklines and breast form fitted clothes. I've given almost all of it away to friends or charity, because the idea if wearing it makes me miserable. I can put up with a l o t to make my family at least tolerable, but I can't do this anymore. I'm at my wits end with this. I can't even tell them I dont like it because they'll be hurt and disappointed and make me feel guilty, and personally I'll feel ungrateful. But I can't keep doing this, and pretending I'm glad that my relatives are trying to dress me like the woman they want me to be, while I'm doing so much work to estrange myself from that.

They're not conservatives, and they've always been supportive of my sexuality, with the exception of a few rare incidents. I don't know how to deal with this, and I really need some help.

They used to be pretty good about getting me clothes it looked like I would wear: neutral stuff, or more kind of masculine clothes.\nSince I've come out to my mother, that's all flipped. Its a CONSTANT barrage of items I literally can't put on without crying. Lacy things, peplums, colors I never touch, plunging necklines and breast form fitted clothes. I've given almost all of it away to friends or charity, because the idea if wearing it makes me miserable. I can put up with a l o t to make my family at least tolerable, but I can't do this anymore. I'm at my wits end with this. I can't even tell them I dont like it because they'll be hurt and disappointed and make me feel guilty, and personally I'll feel ungrateful. But I can't keep doing this, and pretending I'm glad that my relatives are trying to dress me like the woman they want me to be, while I'm doing so much work to estrange myself from that.\n\nThey're not conservatives, and they've always been supportive of my sexuality, with the exception of a few rare incidents. I don't know how to deal with this, and I really need some help.\n\nTL;DR: My family won't respect my gender through clothes, and I don't know how to at the very least stop them giving them to me."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Birthday Blues or How To Get My Relatives To Stop Buying Me Clothes', 'created': 1566806020.0}"

When I talk to people about pronouns they are generally supportive but say the hard part is just practicing with a new habit of speaking. Children’s books are literally designed to help with that kind of learning by using clear, repetitive stories. 

I really want to make something that is plain and accessible for kids and adults so they can just practice using gender neutral vocabulary.  The BusyTown series is a great example- it was updated recently so that gendered words like “policeman” are changed to “police officer” etc. in the new editions.

I want a kids book with regular characters doing regular things- I.e. “my friend has a job, they work at the grocery store. I saw my neighbor today, they said hello.”

There are certain things that I’m wondering how to handle properly such as titles for family members that don’t have a universally adopted pronoun (aunt, nephew, etc). Maybe those things would be addressed directly in a future book.

Basically I'm interested in presenting more androgynously. I am consistently read as binary male (apparently seem gay though), but would hope to convey a bit more of my complex relationship with gender... The problem is that despite feeling internal nonconformity, my natural clothing selection is typically ""masculine"" (t-shirts/jeans). I would be happy if somebody encouraged me to explore skirts etc, but I don't feel particularly euphoric either way, so I stick to what I'm used to.

What prompted me to want to talk to others was realizing that I am drawn to ""masculine"" clothing tailored in ""feminine"" ways, i.e. women's suits/dress shirts, which got me thinking about ways I can present androgyny without skirts/dresses or other traditional ""femininity.""

So here's info about what I like/am looking for, and basically any brainstorm would be appreciated :) I want to explore more but also not feel like I'm putting on an act. I just don't know anything about fashion, don't have enough drive to learn about it myself, and have no friends to ask about it!

\- I like nail polish sometimes. If that seems like a good way to add androgyny I could start painting my nails more consistently

\- I have a cotton button up shirt/blouse borrowed (stolen) from my mom. It makes me feel really nice to wear, but isn't great for everyday. In addition to the formality factor, white shirts make me so anxious about stains, so i don't wear this shirt often! (I don't know how to describe the shirt I have but another kind I also like is the more billowy shirts associated with vampires/pirates... But in a cool way not a halloweeny way. Idk if I like to wear those or just think theyre sexy lol)

\- I also have a longsleeve t shirt that... Well there's nothing especially feminine about it, but for some reason it feels feminine or androgynous to me. It's just a grey tee with the sleeves a slightly different color, and a v-shape sewn at the neckline. Oh and it possibly has elbow patches? Another thing I love. Maybe a women's shirt so a slightly feminine cut. I also think that a waiter called me + a group ""ladies"" when I was wearing it so it may just feel feminine through association to that event.

\- I like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x78_wysTnv4/TrMnS9F9IPI/AAAAAAAAA8o/IiSTEYgcA-A/s640/dear+%252831+of+43%2529.jpg) sort of thing (sweater + collared shirt)

\- Overall dresses/skirts ? Something like [this](https://images.prod.meredith.com/product/fd7ab8326f2cfccb1304c749d2469b0d/1529082663767/l/pinstripe-overall-dress) . I saw a friend's sister wearing something like this although the skirt extended a bit more up the torso, like a small brace/corset (??) and it was so pretty. Again it's hard to know what I want to look like vs what I want to look at.

\- I wouldn't want to wear a very short skirt. Anything above the knee I'd want some form of leggings just for my own comfort. Like I said not especially sure I'll explore skirts, but if anybody has advice for wearing skirts on top of something else, or on how to style longer skirts, that would be a good thing for me to keep in mind.

\- I bought a skirt and leggings online and wore them once, which was weird (unfamiliar) but I felt cute. [https://ibb.co/WpBMpdH](https://ibb.co/WpBMpdH) No euphoria or dysphoria about it, so the thing is without encouragement I would be unlikely to wear that type of thing often. My general approach to clothing is just what's comfortable and easy. I like to look nice but the most effort I'll go to is getting clothes I like, and then putting them on... At this point the unfamiliarity of skirts outweighs the reasons to wear them, especially with outside perceptions and assumptions.

1483,2019-08-27 00:02:47,cvwea1,0,1,"My fantasy story is about werewolves. Some werewolves are mages and a mage’s gender can vary outside of assigned genders, generally falling under the nonbinary umbrella. This is thought to be a spiritual effect from their magic.

Other werewolves and humans can absolutely be transgender, but mages are the most common population.

This is considered a normal part of werewolf culture.

I’ve already developed a canon pronoun set, which goes ve/vir/vis/vis/virself. Ve rhymes with bee, vir with deer, and vis with kiss.

I like this set because “ve” follows the pattern of “he and she” and is easily differentiated in text and during speech without seeming abnormal.

Now I’m looking for nouns for nonbinary people and genders that would refer to both werewolves and humans. These words would be “borrowed” from the werewolf language and used in English.

For example, words related to “woman” are girl, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, and etc.

Those are the type of words I’m looking for. Men are male and use masculine pronouns, women are female and use feminine pronouns, and [x] are [x] and use [x] pronouns.

Suggestions and advice would be appreciated.

Whenever I have discoursed with a lot of people across whom I have come on political issues like trans rights, and more specifically the non-binary culture of which the trans community is part in my estimation, I am honestly looked at with a freak look, one which suggests that I have uttered something like, ""I am am an alien"" --- which is synonymous to one's saying one is NB in the estimation of some, for one's possibilities of gender identification are binary: man or woman, so for one to say otherwise is simply alien to truth and reality.

I have been told that non-binary people are just transtrenders, that you are just identifying as non-binary because it is cool for you to call yourself trans, and you are contributing to the degradation of those members of the 'real' trans community by impeding their progress by convincing people that a gender identity is a sociocultural man-made fiction of some nature, which is something that can be turned off and on and changed like a light switch.

Others say it a phase through which the youngest NB people will grow out once the fad of transness has largely faded from the West.

Ve rhymes with bee, vir with deer, and vis with kiss.\n\nI like this set because “ve” follows the pattern of “he and she” and is easily differentiated in text and during speech without seeming abnormal.\n\nNow I’m looking for nouns for nonbinary people and genders that would refer to both werewolves and humans. These words would be “borrowed” from the werewolf language and used in English.\n\nFor example, words related to “woman” are girl, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, and etc.\n\nThose are the type of words I’m looking for. Men are male and use masculine pronouns, women are female and use feminine pronouns, and [a] are [b] and use [c] pronouns.\n\nSuggestions and advice would be appreciated.

Hi all, I’ve been realizing more and more I fit into a non-binary space in terms of gender. My problem is, it’s forced me to come to terms with my internalized transphobia and lack of ability currently to see gender beyond the binary. I have a very “I’m either male or female which is it” approach and it’s making me miserable. 

For anyone who has struggled to unlearn this and was successful, what has helped you? I’m thinking a good place to start is to practice seeing other NBs as truly beyond gender. I was getting into a very unhealthy habit of trying to figure out people’s sex at birth and I recognize that is toxic energy and accomplished nothing. 

I’m sorry for acting this way, and I hope none of my behaviors have spilled into how I’ve interacted with non-binary people. I fully respect your identity; it’s been an internal struggle that I let consume me beyond myself. For some context, my mom has been very unsupportive of the idea of physical transition, and I think I’m trying to fit into a box of masculine female in order to keep our relationship steady.

So, for a bit of background, I'm in my early 20s, AFAB and realized I was trans when I was 14. Before that, I didn't know trans men existed, only trans women. Discovering there were other people who felt like me was like a revolution. I struggled with my country's medical healthcare system for years until 3 years ago, when I was finally allowed to go on T. In the meantime, I explored my feelings about gender and realized I didn't exactly want to be a man, I just didn't want to be female. I quickly started identifying as agender.

I loved the voice T gave me, the body shape and stamina, however the libido has been overwhelming and feeling kinda like poison, while the hair is kind of a mixed bag of feelings. About 8 months ago, I got top surgery which also was an immense relief. But for some reason, something felt terribly off and for the longest time, I just couldn't put my finger on it.

I'm terribly jealous of trans women. Not trans men, not cis men, not AFAB nb people- *trans women*(alongside some AMAB nb people). I don't know exactly what it is: envy over having been born with more masculine body? fitting in the role of a woman better than I ever could? some internalized misogyny relating to bodies again?

I have no clue. All I know is that while transitionning has made me feel immensely better, I feel that if I had been born with a male body, I would've also ended up transitionning.

I really don't know what this is, and I feel like a creepy fetishist or a ""fake"" transtrender having these feelings.

I've also been looking into nullos (people looking to remove any genitals and secondary sexual characteristics), to whom I relate a lot, but while getting nullification surgery as an AMAB person looks close to GRS for trans women, getting it as an AFAB person looks to other more like FGM and I don't really know how to pursue it without looking like a nutcase. The main appeal behind it, besides the obvious dysphoria I have, would be that nullification looks the same for every sex, and that I would probably look like an AMAB person who's been nullified than the other way around just because guys are the ones who get it the most (and also I pass as male).

Maybe being nonbinary and not having an actual target ""sex"" that exists for it is what's causing the issue here, but it's just so confusing. I don't know if I'm weirdly fetishizing trans women, AMAB bodies, or just having a weirdass nonbinary meltdown.

Its odd as not much has changed aside from the not having facial hair, of which I had very little. Plus I have had ""top surgery"" (minus plastics) so I do still have a little something there, which for someone with a gut my size would be completely aligned with ""man boobs"".

I have cerebral palsy and have limited use of my left hand. Per this instruction [video](https://youtu.be/7HREt_Rbyd0), both hands are used for application.

1652,2019-08-29 22:47:26,cx89al,2,1,"Hey all,

So the long and short of it is that I get really dysphoric whenever one of my friends takes steps towards medically transitioning. 

I'm undecided as to whether or not I should, because while I do want most of what HRT would provide me, it would impair my genital function, which I very much do not want. That's not really what I'm posting about, but it is relevant I think.

Whenever any of my friends takes steps towards medically transitioning, I get *incredibly* dysphoric. Obviously, this isn't great, because dysphoria fucking sucks. What's more troubling, is that my first reaction isn't happiness for them. I feel guilty that my first reaction is to feel insecure about my gender identity, and guilty that I haven't decided whether or not I want to medically transition (which then leads to questioning the validity of my identity, of course). 

I haven't told anyone or shown these feelings to anyone, as I don't want them to feel bad about their gender stuff, or feel like they have to hide anything from me. I think that's pretty fair, at least until I have a better understanding of why my feelings are how they are, and how I can best manage them.

I want to understand why this is my reaction, so that I can work through it. It's obviously not healthy, because it makes me feel bad for no good reason. Normally, I would speak to a therapist about this, but I currently don't have insurance, and as such that's not an option for me. Definitely plan to speak to one the moment I have insurance again, but for the moment, I'm on my own with this, and it is shitty. Self-examination is definitely in order, of course, and that's something that I'm pretty well-versed in; but it's much more difficult without at least a little bit of professional assistance

So, here's the deal. For the past like two years, I've identified as a trans woman, came out to all my family, my job, and been on HRT for a year and a half. All was good, up until recently, I finally admitted to myself that in actuality i am nonbinary. In fact if I really think hard about it, I think I identified myself that way because it seemed more ""normal"" than non-binary. I still heavily identify with femininity and don't intend to change my hrt regimen at the moment, I just can't deny at this point the connection I still feel to masculinity, yknow?

Anyways, on to the main point. As I said before, I basically fully came out and whatnot. I finally in March got my parents to start calling me Sarah and she/her, and they haven't even slipped up in months. But it was a struggle to get to this point, and even to get them to accept me as binary trans. I got everybody's favorite (/s) lines such as ""how do you know it's not just a phase?"" or ""You can't be sure"" and ""I feel like my son died"" and my personal favorite (/s) ""You expect people to call you Sarah when you still look like a man?"" but that's all in the past now.

Because of this past history, I'm especially not excited to come out a second time to them. I feel like everything that was said before will come back: ""how do we know *this* isn't just a phase?"" 

In addition to that, I honestly feel like I'll be seriously inconveniencing people by changing my name again, especially after already doing so once, and when they've only just recently gotten used to it. And that isn't limited to just my family either, probably about half my coworkers, some friends, etc. And it sucks cause I'd really really love to change my name to Rowan and go by they/them pronouns, but I feel like this shit is holding me back a lot.

1721,2019-08-31 09:23:05,cxtzaf,10,6,"Hey y’all,

I’m a cis girl who has been in a relationship with someone who is non-binary, genderqueer. We have dated for 3 years, a year and a half to almost two years ago we stopped having sex. During this time they had gender dysphoria and started taking anxiety medication (somewhat related to one another I think but also they’ve had anxiety all their life). We have a loving relationship in every other way. Recently we broke up because they’ve felt so much pressure, anxiety and physical pain over the fact that we haven’t had sex. They say it feels like a physical roadblock, like they cannot get themselves to have sex with me even though they find my physically attractive. Of note, I’ve told them it’s okay if we don’t have sex for however long and I’ve never pressured them for sex but that has not eased their anxiety. 

When they started taking anxiety medication they lost all sex drive which is a side effect but last year (while taking medication) they started having a strong desire to masturbate and they are able to with enjoyment. Has anyone else dealt with this? Of course its possible that it’s just our relationship but it’s so hard for me to believe because we’re so fulfilled in every other way and we use to have amazing sex (pre-pronoun change and top surgery). I know we aren’t getting back together, at least not anytime soon.

I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.

P.S They say since our breakup they have traded anxiety and feeling pressure for sadness and emptiness regarding our breakup bc we fit so well together and have so much fun with one another, they feel like they’ve lost their best friend but more than that, they feel like we’re more than friends so I believe they’re in love with me in that way.",NonBinary,Cis girl needs advice about nonhetereonormative intimacy,1567268585.0,"{'created_utc': 1567243385, 'id': 'cxtzaf', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'Hey y’all,\n\nI’m a cis girl who has been in a relationship with someone who is non-binary, genderqueer. We have dated for 3 years, a year and a half to almost two years ago we stopped having sex. During this time they had gender dysphoria and started taking anxiety medication (somewhat related to one another I think but also they’ve had anxiety all their life). We have a loving relationship in every other way. Recently we broke up because they’ve felt so much pressure, anxiety and physical pain over the fact that we haven’t had sex. They say it feels like a physical roadblock, like they cannot get themselves to have sex with me even though they find my physically attractive. Of note, I’ve told them it’s okay if we don’t have sex for however long and I’ve never pressured them for sex but that has not eased their anxiety. \n\nWhen they started taking anxiety medication they lost all sex drive which is a side effect but last year (while taking medication) they started having a strong desire to masturbate and they are able to with enjoyment. Has anyone else dealt with this? Of course its possible that it’s just our relationship but it’s so hard for me to believe because we’re so fulfilled in every other way and we use to have amazing sex (pre-pronoun change and top surgery).

26,2019-08-01 10:34:16,ckmmh2,1,1,"Hey, I know that Reddit is not the place for this kind of thing, but I'm still waiting on my therapist responding to my assessment and I need answers, maybe y'all can help.

I've been on hormones for a year and happily (as much as one can be in this transphobic af culture)  identify as a trans woman, but I'm having this crisis of identity.

I feel like I just ""decided"" to be trans. Like for sure there was prescedent- I identified as non binary for years since late high school, shaved my legs, always have been uncomfortable being topless and disliked changing rooms etc... But until quite recently there wasn't really an idea of being female associated with any of that. I disliked my body and had issues but I never thought of myself as at all female. I feel almost like it's some fantasy I've picked up as an idea and put onto myself for various psychological reasons, because there's like... It feels like I wasn't trans before, and then I decided to be trans. I hate this feeling, I feel so insecure in myself but I just don't know how to connect my past and who I was and how I understood myself with my present and future and how I see myself now, and that conflict is messing me up.

I've been understanding this as being because it was made unthinkable for me growing up- like trans people were objectified and vilified, I heard about ""the guy who had a sex change"" in high school, I certainly wasn't going to associate myself with anyone spoken of like that. But why didn't I?

One thing that makes me really uncomfortable is this idea that I'm transitioning to make myself attractive. Like I remember wishing to have been born female as a teenager in a sexual context, and that has been one of the most consistent places for that. I kind of rationalise that as being one of the main places where biological sex is visible and matters, but could it just be a sort of fetish thing? Do I just have a sexualised view of female bodies and femininity, and I'm just transitioning to allow myself to think of myself as a sexual/sensual being?

This all got stirred up by the fact that I am male in my dreams. This always makes me uncomfortable when I wake up because it feels like my subconscious isn't catching up to the fact that I'm trans, and is just sticking to what it was taught. The thing is though, it's been a year of hormones, and even longer since I came out, so why is my mind making me male? Who I was in the dream, like how I acted and the role I took, was very me, but my body and gender were an adult man- something I don't and haven't thought I've identified with.

It's so hard to think about though. I feel like I don't want to be a man, but I can't get a clear understanding of that. I keep asking myself ""why do you feel that? What's underneath that?"" And all I can offer are random, almost academic in their detachment, guesses. I just want an answer that *feels right*. But male, female, non-binary, agender, nothing has the emotional certainty that I'm craving. I feel lost and confused.

It's probably made more difficult by the fact that I *really* don't want to de-transition. Even that word makes me uncomfortable, and I'm not totally sure why. It feels invalidating. I like looking feminine, but I'm not sure if that's something deep-rooted or just a way to escape my body confidence issues. 

I think part of it might be that I don't feel that I really can successfully transition because of my jawline, shoulders, and other masculine features. I know that that's silly and I shouldn't, but knowing that doesn't stop me feeling invalid, and no amount of people hollowly insisting that I'm valid and a woman takes away the image of myself I see in their expression.

Like for sure there was prescedent- I identified as non binary for years since late high school, shaved my legs, always have been uncomfortable being topless and disliked changing rooms etc... But until quite recently there wasn\'t really an idea of being female associated with any of that. I disliked my body and had issues but I never thought of myself as at all female. I feel almost like it\'s some fantasy I\'ve picked up as an idea and put onto myself for various psychological reasons, because there\'s like... It feels like I wasn\'t trans before, and then I decided to be trans. I hate this feeling, I feel so insecure in myself but I just don\'t know how to connect my past and who I was and how I understood myself with my present and future and how I see myself now, and that conflict is messing me up.\n\nI\'ve been understanding this as being because it was made unthinkable for me growing up- like trans people were objectified and vilified, I heard about ""the guy who had a sex change"" in high school, I certainly wasn\'t going to associate myself with anyone spoken of like that. But why didn\'t I?\n\nOne thing that makes me really uncomfortable is this idea that I\'m transitioning to make myself attractive. Like I remember wishing to have been born female as a teenager in a sexual context, and that has been one of the most consistent places for that. I kind of rationalise that as being one of the main places where biological sex is visible and matters, but could it just be a sort of fetish thing? Do I just have a sexualised view of female bodies and femininity, and I\'m just transitioning to allow myself to think of myself as a sexual/sensual being?\n\nThis all got stirred up by the fact that I am male in my dreams. This always makes me uncomfortable when I wake up because it feels like my subconscious isn\'t catching up to the fact that I\'m trans, and is just sticking to what it was taught. The thing is though, it\'s been a year of hormones, and even longer since I came out, so why is my mind making me male? Who I was in the dream, like how I acted and the role I took, was very me, but my body and gender were an adult man- something I don\'t and haven\'t thought I\'ve identified with.\n\nIt\'s so hard to think about though. I feel like I don\'t want to be a man, but I can\'t get a clear understanding of that. I keep asking myself ""why do you feel that? What\'s underneath that?"" And all I can offer are random, almost academic in their detachment, guesses. I just want an answer that *feels right*. But male, female, non-binary, agender, nothing has the emotional certainty that I\'m craving. I feel lost and confused.\n\nIt\'s probably made more difficult by the fact that I *really* don\'t want to de-transition. Even that word makes me uncomfortable, and I\'m not totally sure why. It feels invalidating. I like looking feminine, but I\'m not sure if that\'s something deep-rooted or just a way to escape my body confidence issues. \n\nI think part of it might be that I don\'t feel that I really can successfully transition because of my jawline, shoulders, and other masculine features. I know that that\'s silly and I shouldn\'t, but knowing that doesn\'t stop me feeling invalid, and no amount of people hollowly insisting that I\'m valid and a woman takes away the image of myself I see in their expression. That sounds like regular dysphoria, which makes me feel validated in my identity, but that loops me back to the issue of feeling like is manufactured and reactive to the idea.\n\nI don\'t know what to do and I can\'t make any sense of myself.

58,2019-08-01 23:02:28,ckvs7o,6,3,"Hi.

I am Trans. I have known I was in the wrong body from when I first understood gender. Growing up in the late 70’s and 80’s I did not even know there were others like me until I saw a documentary on someone transitioning then it all made sense.
I never decided to transition probably mostly due to my extreme social anxiety and the fear how those around me would react.
Then recently I found out about gender fluid people who labled as trans also.
This confused me as to me Trans is very clearly knowing you are in the wrong gender body.
You feel ignorant on this. I know someone who I have known a long time come out as trans particularly gender fluid. But they have shown no sign. We have tabletop role played for a long time and I always played female characters they never have and always played male. So there were no signs.

Okey so I wanted to tell about my experiences before but didn’t have a platform to do so and  memories of my “episodes”? (I don’t know the terminology so that’s what I’m calling them) have recently resurfaced. 
I am mtf and my face needs to be shaved every other day to be considered feminine, which I don’t have the energy to do every other day. 
Okey so last year in my sophomore year I struggled with a lot of dysphoria especially what was on my face. Even if my face brushed against something that would ruin my day. Something new started to happen later in the year though, just resting my head on my hand for support would make me feel out of it. 
My strongest episode was in lunch one day when I felt depersonalization and derealization at the same time. I wasn’t feeling that well that day and already wanted it to stop. My hand would usually run across my face instinctively. This time it felt stronger, I remember my hands felt “static” and that I didn’t feel like myself. My friends were well aware of this and asked if I felt alright. I could hear them but everything sounded muffled, I texted on my phone that I didn’t (hearing the sound of my voice wasn’t healthy for me at this state). It felt like I was at the bottom of the ocean, I looked around and the cafeteria that I couldn’t recognize felt 2D, flat, unreal. I looked back at my friends and even they started to look and feel fiction. The small conscience part of me wanted to cry at this point. One of my closest friends, Brian, wanted to feel my forehead and at that point I felt a wave of heat take over my body, he said I felt hot and should go to the nurse but I shook my head in refusal (there wasn’t much the nurse could do anyway,) after he insisted and another shake of my head the bell rang, letting my semiconscious body to go to class.

Several months ago my dysphoria started getting really bad. My girlfriend was very supportive and encouraging at first. We began experimenting with it some and soon it turned into a lesbian relationship. We began going out in public more with me in girl mode. 

Eventually it began to fall apart. The dynamic of the relationship changed. She fell in love with a man who she did not love as a woman. There was not enough support for her, and what she could get often stoked her fears and insecurities. Eventually it kind of turned out that she was a bit of a TERF. That was really difficult.

I've begun coming out slowly to other people. Parents, friends, coworkers, boss.... surprisingly I have received nothing but love and support. Especially strange being in the belt buckle of the bible belt. Everyone has been very accepting, although very inquisitory. So much so that it's almost unnerving. Like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

So now I'm in this weird fucked situation because of being kicked out by my girlfriend where I'm staying in a pretty unhealthy living situation temporarily until I find a place to rent. I have started going to some support groups, but i have not yet gone to see a counselor or begin HRT. 

Last night i went for a walk around the park. It was nice, and i needed to occupy my mind. At the end of the loop, some bros rolled into the parking lot in their dodge charger and I heard the passenger say ""OH MY GOD IS THAT A MAN?!?!?!?"" It was pretty difficult. It made me just feel like a dude in a dress. 

I know I will eventually be passable. This is just going to be difficult until then. Society is fucked.

She still lives at home with my mom (she’s still entirely dependent as she has been slow to learn how to function as an independent adult given her difficulties as an autistic individual) and therefor is surrounded by being referred to incorrectly. I do not visit the family home often so I am not aware of the dynamics, but I am on vacation together with my trans sister and my mom, and am shocked that my mom is still blatantly not accepting my sister in that way. My mom is very sensitive to our emotions so this is incredibly surprising to me, especially given she is a counselor. I am going to talk to her the next time we are not around my sister and grill her about how awful that must be for my sister.

My dysphoria is pretty questionable. My childhood memories are very vague, but I know I do remember having ""little inklings"" as a kid. I had some moments of dysphoria, but I tolerated it, and I could live as a girl to an extent. I attempted to mimic many things my dad did and I was always questioning other people's identities at a young age.  Soically, I hung out with boys and girls and was happy, I was pushed away from hanging out with boys and was told only girls would be appropriate. It felt wrong though. Around only girls I was taunted and teased. I never shared a lot of their interests, and it wasn't fun without a balance of boys and girls around. I ended up being left out of everything.  I am mildly autistic as well, so maybe it contributed.

Fast forward to middle school. My discomfort and misplacement took off like wildfire. I felt like the things that were happening to me were all wrong, and it wasn't me. I remember when my ""friend"" convinced my mom to get me my first bra I had a meltdown, and I felt panicked. That whole day I locked myself up in my room and sulked. Same thing with the later things that came with my body. In locker rooms I always (and still do) hide and change in a stall. I didn't want girls to see my body was like theirs, and (not to sound creepy) but being faced in front of other female bodies in that way made me depressed and reminded me that it was my fate to be like that. At this point, I talked to boys every now and then and still eventually got pushed away. As a result, I tried repressing everything to become as feminine as possible. I had mostly female friends, and I adapted well. I really only enjoyed spending time with one of them though, who had nerdy interests like me. I was happy around her, but I was still upset with myself. I wasn't living my life like how I wanted it to be. It made me upset that I couldn't chase after a lot of the things I liked, and that I couldn't be me. 

In about 9th grade, I slowly rebelled against this and dressed more masculine, and opened up my personality a bit more. I was at an all girl's school so all my friends were female. I felt great, and refreshed in masculine attire, I felt like me. However, I also got scared. I felt trapped in a social world that I couldn't always relate to, because of both dysphoria and autism in my opinion. I couldn't stand that females were the only people I could ever talk to (not in a misogynistic way) and I got upset. I purposely alienated myself, I stopped talking to them and I gave up. 

In 10th grade, I transferred. I now have a mixture of boys and girls as my friends. I'm slowly growing into myself (dressing in men's attire, acting in a masculine way non purposefully, etc) and it feels wonderful. I feel like I can finally be free, it feels like I've been suffocating for years and I can breathe now. I'm starting to ease in and talk to more men again as well, and I feel a lot happier doing that. Women are great friends as well, I just haven't felt allowed to talk to other dudes for ages. I talked to older relatives about it, and they told me to wait, I'm too young to know if I'm trans, and it's probably just autism and depression, not dysphoria, so I have my head in my ass. My therapist told me that I have gender dysphoria and should get immediate help, however. I'm really confused. I want to know myself if I'm just a freak or if these feelings I have are genuine. It scares me to think I'll be in a woman's body forever and never transition, but it also scares me to have so many doubts.

150,2019-08-03 19:33:05,clmsix,1,2,"Hi, this is kind of a long story and I want to apologise for being in a throwaway because I am not ready to be open to everyone. Only 19 persons know it from my surroundings and I want to throw everything out for once.

NSS-TL:DR
Came out trans lesbian and my friends are so supportive that I am too emotional from times to times and can't wait to tell more and more people from every good words I receive from everybody since I stepped big on my life this summer.

I will start from where I got the kick in the butt to awake me that I couldn't lie to myself anymore.

It was at the BBQ of my workplace when one of my coworker brought her daughter and start saying:
*""She only goes along with girls even if there are more men and if there is none, she will be asociale""*

But from afar, with my 10yo dreads, I was tickling her and we were laughing because I am good with kids and during the evening she asks for being sat beside me on a 2 feet tall wall of brick and start tickling me with an herb.

Her dad shouts ""You are the only guy I ever saw my girl having fun with."" Then to her to answer ""I tickle you because I love you.""

My bong rip before shower achieved in my brain every connection in the world from all the calls I ever wanted to flee.

The fact I never really loved my body and felt like my ineffective weapon of self suffering was too much... Could go deep on this one and I am not ready for that personal detail yet.

My mono-breast that developed and the fact I regret having it removed due to mom's pressure. I personally think it is too late for me to do the transition because of that. As I ""banned"" my own nature as I could have had at least one real breast... Then it would be like to ask for a rewind... And I am worried about my future spawn as I won't be able to give birth.

The reason I shaved myself at 8 but got surprised by my dad.

My youth's taste, activities and affinities.

I don't want to be attention whoreing and having you believe I'm crazy so I will end here. 

Thanks for your time!
Be a better version of yourself, every tomorrow.

157,2019-08-03 21:30:22,clo4nl,1,2,"I really don't know if this is the right place to ask for help on this and if not I'm really sorry I'll go somewhere more appropriate. I also want to apologise in advance if anything I say sounds insensitive, I'm not very good with language and though I'm trans and gay, I'm not very involved in the community and don't always have the right terminology. I mean no offence so please correct me if I say something wrong. 

I just came out to my Mother. It was completely unplanned. I never planned on coming out to my family. I've been struggling lately with dysphoria and depression and she asked me what's been bothering me so much. I told her I couldn't talk about it but that I'd be okay and she shouldn't worry. She said she just wanted to help with whatever was bothering me. I said I knew that and appreciated that but I couldn't discuss it. She asked why. 

To explain my answer, first I should say that I have never planned on coming out to my family. Ever. They're very traditional and we come from a very traditional community. I would not be accepted or safe if I came out in this community, with the exception of my Mother who is upset but understanding. I plan on relocating to another country in the future and transitioning there. As for returning to visit my family I figured that I'd cross that bridge when I came to it or try to disguise my transition as much as possible when visiting. At least I'd be self sufficient and have a home in another country to return to if things went wrong. I thought I could disguise it as I've always been quite androgynous. I've always been fairly flat chested so I doubted they'd notice top surgery (ftm). I'd never have reason to show them bottom surgery. As for hormonal changes... well. Harder to hide but maybe a close shave? None of the born male relatives in my family have a lot of facial hair so maybe I won't either? I've been deepening my voice through vocal training for years so maybe the hormonal changes wouldn't alert them? The point is, for years, I've been thinking about how to hide my transition from my family and hometown friends when I get to go through with it. 

Anyway, back to my accidental coming out. When she asked why I couldn't talk about what was bothering me, I said that I had a secret that was a fundamental part of myself that I could never change and I was upset about it. She asked me to explain. I said that it was a secret I'd been keeping and it was a secret about myself that can't ever be changed but it will never hurt or affect her so she shouldn't worry. I said it was nothing for her to worry about because I've made peace with myself and how my life is going to be. 

She said it sounded like it was something awful and she was worried. So she started listing different things, starting with are you a serial killer? which was admittedly pretty funny, until about twenty minutes later she got to the truth. I didn't want to confirm but it was fairly obvious by the expression on my face and she got a little upset. She started to cry and asked me not to tell my Father because she was scared about how he'd handle it. I agreed- I know my Father would disown me and that really is a best case scenario. 

She told me that she loved me but she was so worried for me. I told her I was never going to do anything about it- she told me that she didn't want me to be unhappy. She asked if I had spoken to a professional. I said no, because I'm not going to medically transition. She asked if I'd be happy to live my life that way, without changing my body. I said I wasn't sure. She said that I'm a girl repeatedly. I said that I wasn't. She said that physically, I am. I said yes, I can't deny that. She assured me that she loved me no matter what but admitted that this wasn't what she'd want for her child and she didn't know enough about it to help me. I told her I understood that and I was sorry if this was a disappointment. She said that I wasn't a disappointed as a person but she wished that this wasn't the case for me as she sees this as an obstacle in life and she feels that I won't live a normal life. I said yes, I understood that. She said she was worried about what this would mean for the rest of my life. I said I was too. 

We discussed it for a while longer and she expressed once again that my Father and some siblings wouldn't be accepting and wouldn't allow this. She also asked if I'd ever get married. I've always doubted I'll ever find a relationship if I transition, so I didn't know how to answer the question. I know there are countless other trans people in relationships but I'm not sure I ever will be, so I didn't know how to answer. I just told her I don't know. She was quite upset by that. She said she just wanted me to be happy in life, that she'd always love me, but she was terrified for me. She also asked me not to end my life. I have no intentions to. She said that she doesn't know much about what it means to be transgender- she didn't use that word she has very basic language when it comes to this- but she did know that lots of people in this situation end their lives. I said that some do. I didn't want to explain that that tends to be in cases where people repress their situation, etc. I didn't want her to worry because at the moment I am repressing my identity.

Now, I feel guilty. I don't know why I feel guilty, I know I've done nothing wrong, but I'm so sorry to have hurt my Mother. I know this isn't what she wanted for me and I hate making her cry. I know I have her unconditional love and she's reminded me that I do no matter what. I'm grateful for that and I've always known my Mother loves me deeply even if she doesn't understand me. I'm so lucky for that. But she's also told me that she knows the rest of our family won't accept me and she's confirmed that I shouldn't transition here if I ever do. I went through a lot as a child and teenager and put a lot of stress on her so now I just feel incredibly guilty for putting more stress on her. I didn't want this to become her problem, I wanted to deal with this alone. I wanted to make her proud of me in life and I want her to enjoy her life without worrying for me. 

Now, she's upset and it feels awkward between us. She's tried to make conversation and I've tried to return it normally, but there's an obvious tension between us and she's clearly very upset. I don't know what to do from here. Do I just return to normal and act as if I never told her? Do I give her some resources to read? I'm not sure how to make her feel less worried. She is very very sheltered about LGBTQ+ issues and she doesn't understand the community at all. This isn't hatred on her part but she's never had to learn about it. She has no hate in her heart and she's a kind woman, just sheltered. I do feel loved by her but I don't know what to do to make her feel better. She's going away for a work trip soon and she's expressed that she doesn't want to go because she's scared for me. I've told her that nothing has changed, she just knows my secret now, nothing is going to happen to me, I'm fine and safe. She told me that she's always worried about me and she can't help but worry more now. I don't want this to ruin her trip.

I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I feel awful and guilty and sad. I wish I hadn't told her. I wish I'd told her nothing was bothering me. If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it. If not, I just feel better for having shared somewhere.

**Summary of the UK Equality Act: 'sex' and 'gender reassignment'**

Under the UK Equality Act,  sex and gender reassignment are both, and separately, protected. In UK law, ‘sex’ is understood as binary, with a person's legal sex being determined by what is recorded on their birth certificate. A trans person can change their legal sex by obtaining a GRC. A trans person who does not have a GRC retains the sex recorded on their birth certificate for legal purposes.

So this means that there are data points for both 'gender reassignment' and 'sex', by means of a ""legal"" sex and a sex ""assigned at birth"".

**Legal self-ID (not social)**

In social terms, everyone should have the right to self-ID; to not be misgendered nor mistreated in terms of their sex or gender. The UK Equality Act aims to protect this right. 

In legal terms, it seems important to have an objective measure for how we determine 'sex'. In the UK Equality Act, this can be determined by either the assigned sex at birth, or the legal sex. 

In this article, I read a paragraph that stunned me:

""…The prioritisation of self-declared gender identity within policy-making represents a departure from the key principles which have underpinned advances in women's rights, and carries significant implications for how female inequality is addressed. As [**Stock (2019)**](https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/scot.2019.0284#) argues, the dismissal of sex as a relevant policy tool ‘leaves us with no adequate language to describe a politically important feature of material reality’, undermines our ability to ‘track actual facts about sex, as it operates across various social groups, practices and discourses’, and describe the effects of sexism and misogyny. From a legal and policy perspective, the argument that a transwoman should be treated as a woman sits uneasily with the [**Equality Act 2010**](https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/scot.2019.0284#), as it renders sex irrelevant as a protected characteristic… while the Act does allow trans people access to single-sex services, this is not unconditional and single-sex services providers may exclude trans people providing certain tests are met.""

[https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/scot.2019.0284](https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/scot.2019.0284)

In British Columbia, Canada, the requirement for surgery to change the birth certificate gender marker was removed in 2014. The BC Human Rights Tribunal (BCHRT) is currently facing a case that presents a key difficulty: whether the waxing of a woman's base, shaft and scrotum is discrimination for any business that offers ""Brazilian waxes"" to women. This case is difficult to resolve for many reasons. For example, training courses for women's waxing has not historically included the base, shaft and scrotum.

There are other concerns in self-ID that relate to sports, prisons, etc. 

**Transgender is distinct from DSD**

Within this discussion, it seems important to maintain a clear distinction between DSD and trans people because DSD is, by definition, about atypical development of a person’s body. DSD is defined by the medical community as “congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal or anatomic sex is atypical.”

Although it is certainly possible that a child born with DSD will eventually identify as a transgender person, it is also possible for children born without DSD to eventually identify as transgender. Most people with DSD are not transgender, and most transgender people have no identifiable DSD.

**TLDR**

TLDR; I am extremely concerned that a legal self-ID will have a radical and negative impact on the UK Equality Act. I am seeking reassurance and evidence that a perpetrator's legal self-ID would not be **unconditional** in times of significant discrimination, harassment and abuse. I recognize that the significant majority of instances of a legal self-ID would cause no harm.",trans,[UK Equality Act] Would a legal self-ID render sex irrelevant as a protected characteristic?,1564960330.0,"{'created_utc': 1564935130, 'id': 'cly1os', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'This is a genuine question, and does not intend to cause distress.

How do you be sure? I'm not sure if I want to be mtf or not. Here's some things I feel/notice:

First of all - nearly 16 (16 in March)

Don't mind being a boy, but I *think* I might like being a girl more? Not sure if that's dysphoria or what.

Have longer hair, just made it cover less of my face and looks slightly more feminine?

I enjoy using more feminine Snapchat filters, but I'm too embarrased to show it to anyone else.

Feel like I'd enjoy having female parts more?

Haven't tried dressing up or anything, too embarrased and don't know how I'd try without people knowing as I souldn't be able to buy clothes or anything without my mum knowing

Recently (for a few days) feel I want to try to be more feminine, but I'm embarrased and don't know what people would think of me (hence the not sharing snapchat filter pics)

I think I wan't to be more feminine/""cute"", but don't wsnt people to judge me. (Feel like I can't express my more feminine side? Dunno.)

So overall I don't know if I really want to be trans or not. I don't want to ztart some sort of treatment or surgery, then to realize it was a phase or something. I feel I'd wsnt to be more feminine but I don't know how others would react. 

Are there questions I can ask myself? Ways I can try things without people knowing? (At least at first) Also, what methods of becoming trans are there. (Like surgeries, hormones, etc)

267,2019-08-05 23:02:01,cmig6l,2,5,"For the longest time, I’ve always had these thoughts where I would be totally cool with waking up as a woman and living my life that way. And those “Would you press the button to get money, but also you’d have to change genders” were always a super easy answer for me. “Hell yeah, why wouldn’t I?”

I’ve had this feeling of wanting to be a cute girl for as long as I can remember. I never spoke to anyone about it, but I always thought, “Me, a cis male, is thinking these things, therefore it must be a normal thought that other cis males have.” 

I recently learned that it definitely not the case. 

I stumbled across r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns and r/egg_irl and I never felt more at home. 

Everyone having the same thoughts as me, I’ve been a “certified egg” for the longest time, but I was talking to a friend earlier, explaining my feelings and it hit me. 

As I was typing out some thoughts I wrote, “Would I want to be a girl? Yeah! Do I still want to be a boy?” And at that point, I could answer it. I realized that I didn’t. I realized that I don’t like who I am. I felt this massively overwhelming feeling of almost relief. 

I don’t want to be a male. 

Reflecting on that, and everything else I’ve felt throughout my life made me break down into tears. 

I know what I want, for once in my life. 

I feel almost complete. 

I feel a sense of pride. 

I told my friend what I was going through at that moment. She asked me what my name was going to be, and I wasn’t sure. My shortened name is unisex, so I said I could just stay with that. That way it’s less confusing for everyone else. 

She said, “Fuck that. Girl, it’s about you”

Girl. 

The tears came flooding back

It felt so good to be called that

I felt pure bliss at that moment 

She sent me a picture of some baby shower decorations that said, “It’s a girl!”

I’ve never felt that type of happiness.

This is who I am now, this is me. It’s so overwhelming. 

But now the hardest part is going to be letting people know. I have massive fears about what other people think of me. My anxiety has been rampant when I told a few of my friends. But they’ve all been supportive and happy for me. 

The issue is my ex-wife. 

I haven’t told her yet. I don’t necessarily want to, but we have a kid together, so I’ll be subjected to being around her more often than not. 

As is, when I came out as pansexual, she’s poked fun at me. It’s like she won’t let me be me. I can’t feel comfortable when I’m around her. I can’t be who I want to be, and it’s killing me. 

That time will come. Eventually. 

As for now, I have my other friends who are here for me, and are going to support me through this whole thing. 

My next move is to find a counselor or therapist that I can talk to. I need professional help with dealing with all of these new emotions, and hopefully I can start a conversation about possible transitioning. 

Im hoping this is the right place to post this, I just really needed to get this off my chest to other people. There’s only a very small select number of friends I’ve told. I chose them because I knew they’d be okay with it. It’s a start. And I’m so very glad I have them in my life. 

Do anyone have any advice on how to deal with this newfound epiphany? Any tips on how to deal with people? Where to go from here?

TL;DR I was born male, and now I want to be female. Some friends are supportive, but I fear telling others. But regardless, I’m happy with this new choice of mine.

It’s like she won’t let me be me. I can’t feel comfortable when I’m around her. I can’t be who I want to be, and it’s killing me. \n\nThat time will come. Eventually. \n\nAs for now, I have my other friends who are here for me, and are going to support me through this whole thing. \n\nMy next move is to find a counselor or therapist that I can talk to. I need professional help with dealing with all of these new emotions, and hopefully I can start a conversation about possible transitioning. \n\nIm hoping this is the right place to post this, I just really needed to get this off my chest to other people. There’s only a very small select number of friends I’ve told. I chose them because I knew they’d be okay with it. It’s a start. And I’m so very glad I have them in my life. \n\nDo anyone have any advice on how to deal with this newfound epiphany? Any tips on how to deal with people? Where to go from here?\n\nTL;DR I was born male, and now I want to be female. Some friends are supportive, but I fear telling others. But regardless, I’m happy with this new choice of mine. I finally feel in control only my life for once.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I finally cracked out of my eggshell', 'created': 1565071321.0}"

I feel like I would probably be more comfortable having girl ""parts"" rather than male ones

Pretty much everything I do has to happen late at night after my roommate is asleep, and I'm constantly dealing with stress bc if I get found out, pretty much my entire life is screwed over.  Nonetheless, I've been pretty successful thus far.

It still sucks though.  I love the euphoria when I do wear almost all feminine clothing, but the dysphoria of knowing that I've still got to be in boymode even when I do such and that I can never realistically transition has me feeling like I'm just lying to myself.

Tonight has been weird because of it.

And this isn't really that surprising, since I'm still figuring out sizing on things, but I am still really bumbed about it bc I ordered my jeans size and everything and it's just not what I was hoping it would be.  And I'm too scared to return them and order a smaller size, because then I'd have to bring more attention to them and the smaller size might end up being too small?  idk.

289,2019-08-06 05:08:07,cmmbxb,2,0,"hello. 
why do i feel like this?
i fantasize (non-sexually, obviously) about being trans. i know it sounds weird. for more background: i hate my feminine name but i don’t hate my body, i just like it more when i’m binding/look masculine. i can appreciate my body objectively, but it doesn’t feel like me. i like being seen as either a boy or something between a girl and a boy. i feel like my life hasn’t started yet, and i’m just waiting. when i think too much about my gender i feel a panic attack coming on and i put it off. i feel a sense of disconnect between my life and my subconscious. often i feel homesick for somewhere i’ve never been. i hate (feminine) women’s clothes for the most part, i hate being called a girl or pretty, and i hate being seen as/ called a lesbian. 
but anyways, i often fantasize about coming out as a trans man. i think about telling people my new name and pronouns and dealing with people at my school and just existing as a trans man. i obviously want to be seen as a man but i also want to talk about my transition. this sounds weird. i want to wear a trans flag and be proud of who i am. sure i look up to cis men and want to be them and i’d be much happier if i woke up one day as a teen boy instead of the freak i am now but i fantasize about having a trans experience.

After looking around a bit I figured I had some sort of gender euphoria, which I think explained my situation well. However, I'm not certain I should commit to anything major as of yet (nor come out anytime soon), but I figured a good place to start would be to try cross dressing.

I have a very passable idea for an excuse as to why I would have female clothes (gender-bender themed party at college) in the meantime, which could also be used to diffuse awkward confrontations in stores buying fem related stuff (buying bra related stuff would still probably be lethally awkward). I do not know what to buy or how to determine what kind of makeup to buy or what bra and/or breast substitute to look for.

There is someone at my college who someone recommended to me who could help with at least the makeup, I know she's LGBT+ friendly but I haven't spoken to her much so it could be a tad odd just coming out of nowhere and asking for help.

Another issue is I feel some of my facial features are quite masculine, i.e.: large nose bridge, more angled jaw.

tl;dr: Newbie wants to dip his toes into trans by cross-dressing, needs advice on what/how to buy.

316,2019-08-06 19:59:05,cmvg2v,3,11,"I've always felt something along the lines of ""if science could give me a prostate, I'd immediately switch"" but dismissed it as a combination of hating how society treats women in general and just deeply wishing I was someone Not Me.  I never gave it too much thought because I'm pretty happy with the life I have (husband, kids, straight privilege) and my husband is extremely straight.  But *now,* everything in my marriage is bashing repeatedly against the rocks, so there's no reason not to chase this idea down further.

I don't hate the femaleness of my body, but the sort of dark pleasure that I've derived from seeing it become less and less ideal due to aging, pregnancy, weight changes, etc has a certain tinge of self-destructiveness?  I do loathe the way women fit into society and at times deeply resent male privilege.  Similarly, I was always baffled why anyone would *want* to be a woman (I've gotten over this bit of bigotry, fortunately) which is another hint that maybe my hangups around gender are more than just frustration with the unfairness of it all.

But on the other hand, I don't want to be male so much as I want to be a teenager of the dude persuasion.  Which, uh, isn't exactly a gender identity as much as it is an escapist fantasy.  My own teen years were filled with a lot of obstacles, restrictions, and difficulties tied directly to being a girl &amp; meanwhile, my curriculum choices sort of automatically filtered me into having mostly male friends.  So there's a long history of being on the outside looking in at all the greener grass. (Lookit, I made the metaphors match!)   My fondness for PG Wodehouse books and boarding school narratives doesn't do much to dispell this perception that being a young man with a bit too much time on his hands with a few too many friends with low impulse control must be the most fun thing in the world.

I dunno.  I really have always felt that if transitioning was as easy as flipping a switch, fuck yeah I'd flip it.  But I don't know if that opinion is due to an active desire to switch genders or if it's due to a sort of background loathing of societal restrictions on women.  And with regard to dysphoria, seeing my body become more womanly over the years has actually been sort of satisfying—but it's been a sort of morbid fascination with how much my female body has been distorted and ""ruined"" by living a standard feminine life.  

Is there anyone else who struggled with these sort of ambiguous feelings?  What pushed you into deciding ""yup, I'm trans"" as opposed to writing everything off as hating the patriarchy?  What pushed you into feeling like actually transitioning was worth how much more difficult life would be?

I do loathe the way women fit into society and at times deeply resent male privilege.

In the last few years I’ve met many trans people. I have had trans co workers and mutual friends and I’ve met them out and about etc. I’m a typical straight white guy and I really strive to be a force of pure love and acceptance and comfort to everyone and everything. 

Last year I made the mistake of accidentally misgendering a coworker twice in one day. It really upset her and I never ever want to do that again. The thing is, I’m not 100% sure of what the rules are and Id really like to better understand as to avoid any discomfort and misunderstandings. Since that incident I’ve found myself tip toeing around them at times. I’m unsure about a lot of things and so I often am hesitant to ask and this tends to create a subconscious barrier between both sides. For example is it rude to ask upfront about what gender they prefer? Is it rude to ask about the transitioning process? 

There is one trans person in particular who I’d really like to become closer to. The thing is is that they are always joking and laughing and having fun but as soon as I walk up I can feel the slight discomfort and the energy changes.

Are there things professors tacitly or maybe unintentionally do that could be construed as discriminatory or hostile to you?

What things can profs do besides using appropriate names/pronouns to make you and the class environment comfortable?

What else would be helpful for profs to know when working with trans students in places like the South where there's peak hostility?

My partner and I have a healthy open relationship. He's been non-binary (identified as gender-flexible at the time) from day one. The combination this, the fact that he has some Asperger's tendencies (as he'd say), the way he looked, the fact that we met at the  kink scene all hit in the right places. I didn't know how long it's going to last, he sure as hell didn't know it's going to last years (he tried to get rid of me, but as he would say, kept coming back for more... hehe) and well, here we are living together in the same apartment and it works. I'm his first move out of his parents' house, and he got his first real job (able to pay his own rent, which he's very proud about as he should be) in the last couple of months since we started to live together. It's a good relationship, we support each other, we love each other, and the sex is great. 

And that's the big problem. I wish, god I wish sex would NOT be such an issue for me. I hate how low, flat and boring this is. I hate how awful this is. I'd seriously consider an operation to remove my balls if it wasn't a part of me that I like, and sex is just too fucking good. He does not have my sex drive, but we manage. 

So now that you have the information filled in, I think the rest is painfully familiar. I know that I'm not going to be as attracted to him physically as I am now when he transitions. He is the most attractive long-term person I've ever been with, and our chemistry is awesome. The fact that he's going to transform feels like the equivalent of him telling me he has cancer: he has some time left to live, after which he would be gone. He will still be there, yes, but a different person. I want him to do it. I want him to transition because he wants it. It's who it is. I understand \*I\* don't want it, and I know this is \*my\* problem, but that doesn't help jack shit, he's still going to be gone. It doesn't help that he is the only one I'm physical with -- even though  I'm in an open relationship, being close to 40 means it's not easy to find attractive women with the same mindset (please don't tell me to try to date, I've been doing nothing but for the last 2 years, no one worth the time is seeking someone ""taken"" who doesn't want kids). So that's what I meant earlier about cutting my own nuts. I mean what's the point? It gives me nothing but pain, like a drug addict who can't get a fix no matter how hard he tries. And I hate it. 

We talked about this before, to an extent. He knows I'm scared he's going to become ""a big fat bear"" but it's not even that. I'm just afraid of losing someone I love. Someone I can't replace and don't want to replace. I am afraid that I can't be with him if he transitions because I will be a shadow of what I used to be to him. I love him too much and I won't leave, but I will be more of an empty shell, a shoulder to cry on  perhaps, that sort of thing. And autistic tendencies or not, he knows. he will know. And it will hurt him. And I can't bare the thought of hurting him. He's innocent, he's sweet, and all he wants is to become more of who he really is. And I'm the damn asshole in the way because I need sex. 

So I'm sure you've heard this story  or versions of it many times before. I'm sure many of you are on the other side of this fence, you've been pushed out of your families, out of relationship, been casted out and rejected constantly. I don't know how this is like in that regard, but I know enough that I never want to do this to him. But at the same time, I don't know what to do. I'm lost.

Which, I know doesn’t correspond to gender- anyone can like dresses- but i do love that he’s down to play with gender roles like that. At the same time, I do sometimes like wondering if he is an enby egg, but then I worry maybe I’m projecting too much, wishing him to be something he’s not, so I force myself to stay silent on my secret little hopes. \n\nTo clarify, I’m pan, so honestly I’ll always love him no matter what. We’ve been dating over a year, friends longer, and I’ve never been happier with someone. I just also think it’d be awesome to date a fellow tran \n\nIs it wrong for me to like the idea of him being something he’s (maybe???) not? Would it be wrong for me to tell him that he kinda seems like an egg sometimes, to try and get him to actually think about his identity? Do I just let him figure it out and stay silent?

Context for why I'm sending this.
I want this to be out there just to prove how much of a cunt he is my second time writing this due to losing the original because of discords 2000 character limit.

Context for the messages/relationship

He would force me to call him sir, master and anything that made it look like he had power over me. He also forced me to put kisses so he knew I was his and his only.

He believed that womens jobs was to cook, clean, listen and be sex objects to there ""masters"" 

He forced me into various sexual situations that made me feel comfortable.
Including telling me about sexual dreams he would have (containing things such as, physical harm, weapons, rape, forced bondage, depriving someone of food and water, chaining/tying someone up so they can't ever leave, suicide, necrophilia and blood shed).

He would threaten physical harm.
He had a cane he called his ""peasant beater"" and would often thresten to hurt and sodomize me with it as well as threaten me with other weapons. He would also brag and remind me about how he nearly killed his sister and got away with it (even though police was involved) and how he could easily get away with it. He would often become aggressive towards me if I denied him sex or anything sexual.
/
He caused physical and sexual harm to me regularly in ways such as smacking, choking and putting out cigarettes on me (which has scared).
On one occasion he forced me to give him my login details to various social media, he then found out that my boss at the time had given me cider and that I was talking to friends because of this he throwed my phone across the room and began throwing various things at me. He then forcefully pushed me out of his room where he grabbed his cane and shut his door, he then proceeded to demolish his bedroom. I went into his bedroom room to try and retrieve my phone and bag he then tries to hit me the cane multiple times saying I cant have my phone he then grabs my bag throwing it down the stairs, he then grabs my phone and shuvs it in my face trying to hurt me so I slapped across the face out of self defense breaking two of his teeth.
On another occasion we was in his room where he forces me to strip naked after an small argument I do as he makes me we makes me go on his bed where shortly after another argument occurs where he accuses me of cheating for some reason. when the argument begins to die down he grabs me by the neck hard and forces him self onto me and precedes to rape me.
He also admitted he would secretly record sexual moments like this (without my consent).

He would always accusing me of cheating.
He claimed this was because he was cheated on and abused in past relationships.

He would constantly threaten me with self harm and suicide.
On my sisters 21st on the new year's ever of 2017 he threaten to over dose on sleeping tablets when I had drank alcohol,even to the point of taking a picture of pills in his hand and him taking them. 
/
He would purposefully make me feel invalid and make me even question my gender and sexuality.
He would say that girls aren't into the exact things I'm into and he said that no one would take me seriously as girl because I'm bi sexual making me ashamed of my sexuality up until this week. On top of this he  would also try to make me change my preferred name to something he picked usually something from an anime like attack on titan. He also associated my preferred name at the Mili with the abbuse towards me causing me to change it to Laura when I started to try and leave. He would also mock me for having at the time sort hair even starting arguments about it if had to get it cut.

He wouldn't let me leave my house to the point I had to sneek out to do basic stuff such as shopping and college. He also said that if we was to get a house he would keep me tied up so I couldn't leave and I could clean and cook and ""he could fuck me when he wants"".

He often encouraged suicide and self harm.
He made me stop seeing my then at the time councilor and he even forced me to stop taking my antidepressants. 

He also encouraged toxic behaviour towar my family including, verbal abuse and stealing from them.

So something went down in my group chat that I just want to write out here.

For some context, i am a FtM teenager and I have only cis friends (some of them are LGBT though).

So today we were just talking, and the topic of me being trans came up. No big deal, i’m fine with talking about it with them. I say that i’m uncomfortable with my mom, aunt, and cousin calling me my dead name and using she/her pronouns (i was just on vacation with them for 2 weeks). One of my friends, let’s call him Z, started giving me advice on how to get them to call me by my correct name and pronouns. I said that I appreciated the advice, but that I’ve tried the methods Z had given me already. Z proceeds to type (more specifically, rant) that I should assert my identity with violence. Z also starts cussing me out because I was “being a dick because you wouldn’t take my advice” (I admittedly type in all lowercase).

I shut off my phone because I didn’t want to cause more trouble.

My other friend interjects (let’s call him J) and said that he should “stop typing in all caps”.  Z and J converse for a while, with Z saying that I was “being ungrateful”. 

Was I an asshole, or was Z an asshole? Were we both assholes? Were none of us assholes? I don’t know.

So, it’s odd, but temporary tattoos. 

I found masculine temporary tattoos on amazon and it just generally helps with my dysphoria. It can be visible or not, it doesn’t really matter. It still helps me feel more masculine.

At first it was a “hey this is here. Don’t hurt yourself, your skin is beautiful” and that helped since it was only that one area I self-harmed on but I also found that it helped with my dysphoria

I just put one on cause my dysphoria was getting super bad and now I’m feeling much better :))

So mtf girls, you can probably guess it’s the same thing, just feminine tattoos. 

I know, it’s odd, but that’s my tip!

Men, dragons, snakes, animals, masculine seeming patterns, skulls, Fire, death!!!! Anything you feel helps
Woman, flowers, animals, birds, things like that (sorry I don’t personally know so this section is lacking, but yeah)

I mostly kept it to myself till earlier this year, I came out to my friends as non-binary because I was still in denial of being completely female to male. I don't know why, in all honesty.   


I know some of them talked to me about this, because I did bring up that I don't want to be referred to as she/her at all as it makes me feel completely uncomfortable in my own skin and brings forth a disgust in myself whenever I hear myself being referred to as female. But I never minded he/him pronouns, and didn't mind they/them. 

I came to accept that I'm a trans man and I've tried to come out to my mother on several different occasions, but she refuses to accept it. She uses excuses like ""but you still wear makeup"" and things like that. She even called me up one day after I ranted about how she doesn't accept me, and she said ""I accept you, \[insert dead name\], you're just not trans"". I know that dysphoria works differently for all trans people. Wearing dresses set off my dysphoria  (is that how I should put it?) but wearing makeup does not.

I've learned to cope with her not accepting me by reaching out to all my friends about my gender and such, and the first person that I came out to actively participates in this thread, so, thank you man!

I've been having a lot of dysphoria lately, in an agender phase, and it sucks. It sucks so much. All my clothes suck. Nothing makes me feel okay. Binding is as close as I can get to getting rid of the dysphoria, but it's still painfully obvious that I'm not comfortable. I never know what to wear, and ironically, it's easiest to just lie wrapped in a blanket naked.

I keep trying to remind myself that my body is not my gender, but it's really hard when the world genders me based on my body. I get it, I have a biological sex and that means something, but it's not the same as my gender and right now I'd rather not have any gender at all. My brain is going on about gender being useless and unnecessary, just something to divide us and make us separate, based on reproductive parts and then extended into a bullshit dichotomy that serves as a foundation for so much pain.

I know that surgeries won't help with the dysphoria, and I feel like a bad trans person for that. I can't take hormones either because the dysphoria for one gender will just be replaced when I switch into the other gender (like taking HRT to be more masculine will fuck me up when I feel more femme.) There aren't really any problems I have with my body anyway, on my own. It's when I go out and about and people gender me that the dysphoria hits the hardest so I've been really agoraphobic and not going outside when the agender phase arrives. Maybe if I looked more androgynous, people wouldn't gender me so starkly, but I don't have the means right now to do that and don't know how to achieve that or if I would even be comfortable with an androgynous gender expression.

When I feel like a girl, I feel very much like a girl, and when I feel like a boy, I'm very much a boy. Once I thought I was demi, but it's much more euphoric to really sink into the gender and express it that way. But the agender phase is the worst because I don't know how to express it without going into silly androgynous looks that will still make it hard for me to pass as agender.

I’m unsure if I’m transgender (FTM) or not, but here are my reasons.

While I was growing up I was always super feminine and loved pink and girly things, such as hello kitty and Barbie dolls. Now that I’m older I’m questioning my gender identity.

During the middle years of my life I was a classic masculine girl. Tomboyish. Never had short hair but acted sorta like a guy. I wished I could be a guy.

A month and a half ago I started feeling uncomfortable being called a girl, pretty, beautiful and uncomfortable on how feminine my body and face looks. (Mainly my chest) My desires to be male grew intensely and I don’t know if it’s gender dysphoria or it’s just me being stupid. I looked into it more about when I first started questioning and it sorta made sense.

I’m having a hard time believing I’m trans — or not trans enough because I was super feminine as a young kid and I don’t think my parents would believe I’m trans because of that.

Can anyone on reddit tell me if I’m actually having dysphoria or if I’m just being stupid.

As he’s grown (he’s almost 10) he’s given a lot of hints as such - his stuffed animals were boyfriends, he kissed a boy in second grade, etc. Last year he started painting his nails with a lot of frequency (he got nail polish from a friend since I don’t even have nail polish). My husband and I have never been bothered by this at all because we just want him to love who he is and be happy with himself.   

Last year at school he tried to kill himself. With little knowledge of self harm thankfully he was not even close to danger. 

Since then we have put him in counseling. My son and I have a very close relationship. For some of his sessions he asks me to join him. A few weeks ago he told his therapist he has always felt as though he should have been born a girl and feels more female than male. I’ve never heard him express that before and although I was surprised it didn’t hurt me at all. 

Ever since then though I’ve been stressed with worry. I’m worried for what he’s going to go through at school, with his life, etc. I want to protect him from the hate, the cruelness he may encounter, etc. We have not even told the family of this since some grandparents will not be supportive and they may start treating him differently from our other children. 

How can I/we be supportive of this? 

What kind of things should I be looking out for that there’s a potential problem with a bully at school? 

What have your experiences been growing up? 

When did you feel different at your birth gender - is it normal to be this young and feel that way? I know anything can happen but will it change back because he’s so young? 

Sorry for the barage of questions - I just want to be supportive of him (he doesn’t want me to call him her and likes his name - which ironically is used as both a male and female name). I’ve never had any trans friends - not because I’m not open but because I can’t say we have a large population of trans people in our area.

Gender has never really mattered much to me and I've never strongly identified with my assigned gender- this isn't too unusually or so I have been told. In the past, I had wondered if I was perhaps genderfluid, but this was during the- for lack of a better term- the anti-SJW 'shoot down transtrenders' stage of the internet so I never allowed myself to really explore that as a possibility. Mostly out of fear of ridicule.

Now that that has been moved past for the most part. I really do want to have a serious discussion regarding that.

I sometimes find myself just wishing to be different than how I am already physically when it comes to how I present myself to others- but idk if thats just me being insecure and/or dysphoric.

The first post I made on this account was on this sub, and mostly talked about my experience after accepting myself. The truth is I've never done that. I've never gotten to a point where I've been definitely able to say I'm trans. I know that's the case for pretty much everyone. It's never definite. In fact I know it's that very thought that is used against the trans community when trying to get ahold of HRT or reassignment surgery and other helpful medical things. When I say it's not definite I mean that I'll have times where I feel very comfortable accepting that maybe I am trans (MtF btw). Then there's the rest of the time where I reject that idea completely. Like there's no way I am. The thing is even when I'm rejecting the idea I still get bothered by male pronouns being used, or I get nervous when the trans community is brought up in conversation, like I'll out myself or something. One example of the irrational fear of outing myself is at school. There's one fully out trans person in my school (saying ""fully out"" because idk if there are more). They're FtM. Every time I talked to them last year I had this irrational fear that they'd ""figure me out"", and I'd get super nervous around him. Any way I don't want to ramble on about that. It's a hard feeling the describe, but I'm sure plenty of you feel it. The feeling like you are the opposite gender, but then you don't feel like you are, and even when you don't feel it you still do (it's quite confusing I'm sorry). This feeling has stopped me from doing one big thing. If you look through my post history there's a post to r/traa where I say that I was going to come out to my mom. I didn't. I was planning on it, but doubt took over and I deleted the letter. I don't regret it though. My life has gotten so confusing that I don't even feel like I know who I am. I feel like I'm in a rush to figure it out. I'm 16, which is very young I understand that, but I'm dealing with male puberty and have been hating almost all of it. Even though I hate it I still doubt me being trans. I just don't understand anything going on. I feel like I keep asking myself every day why I keep rejecting this part of me. And the answers always that it's just a part of me that I don't fully understand. I don't know how to understand it though. Thus I've entered what I like to call ""My never ending cycle of questioning"" (see title). I call it that because that's what it feels like. Like it will go on until the day I die and torment me until then. I just don't know what to do. Even when I do think of possibly doing something about my whole gender identity crisis (makes it sound way more intense then it probably is honestly) I keep telling myself to out it off. Not only because of the neverending questioning thing, but I'll find other reasons. The main reason I find right now is to wait until after my senior (which I'm entering this year).

819,2019-08-17 14:43:48,crmz7n,4,3,"I’m coming out to my cousin and his fiancé today. 

They are in town this weekend to announce to the whole family about their engagement, but everyone already knows. They are two of the closest people in my life, we were all kinda shy kids growing up.

I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I’m at peace with that. Realizing I’m meant to be a woman has given me so much strength. It’s been an amazing last few months, even though I have so many questions about who I want to be, I finally know what direction I want to go. That has made all the difference in the world, but it doesn’t make me immune to getting hurt.

So, there’s a lot going on in this situation but I’ll try to keep this brief

1. My younger cousin is getting married in India this January to his wonderful gf, who is Indian. It will be a very traditional wedding.

2.He and I are very close, family says we are like brothers,and I’m close with his gf as well. She is very family focused, and since she has no family here, she kinda already sees us as family too.

3. Yesterday she even called me because it was some brother sister holiday in Hinduism, sorry I can’t recall the name, and said 
“I hope you will be my big brother for ever and ever” I said I will always see her as my little sister.

4. I’m not out to them yet. I’ve been on Hrt for 6 months, but not presenting feminine yet. 

5. I’m pretty sure my cousin won’t have any problems with me being trans, I’m not as sure about her. She is not conservative or homophobic at all but... her cousin just got out of a marriage because the spouse came out as trans. I’m pretty sure gf only herd her cousins side of the story, because she said 

“of course trans people are real, but he isn’t a real one, he’s just been tricked by the doctors into thinking he is”

My cousin immediately scolded her for saying that, and I haven’t had the chance to bring up the subject since then. That was about three months ago. 

6. Since then I have brought up trans people a few times and he has not shown any red flags, so I’ve even hinted a few times that I’m trans. Im pretty sure he’s oblivious to all this though. We watched Euphoria together and he didn’t realize Jules was trans until episode 4 or 5. Even though I told him those were estrogen shots she was taking in the first episode.

TL/DR: Coming out to cousin and his fiancé today. Wedding is a traditional Hindu wedding in January. It’s going to be my first wedding and I will be on hrt around one year when it happens.

Wish me luck!

I currently don't go to school or see many other people than my close fam and friends (mental health issues, whoo) so I don't have to worry about coming out there, but my mum is catching on. One of the people that work with me mentioned Mermaids to her offhandedly (it's a UK-based charity for trans kids).

So, yesterday she brought it up to me. I am an awful liar, but I didn't want to confirm anything, so I let her go on about how when she was younger, she wanted to be a boy too but she grew out of it (yeah, gross, but I don't think she's transphobic, just a little ignorant). She then said she was going to refer me to mermaids through the person that introduced her to them.

I flat out told her no. I don't want to be out to so many people, and I honestly don't want to seek support for being trans right now. When I need it, I will ask, but right now it's something I can manage comfortably, and being out to loads of people will just stress me out.

She, however, has decided that that means that I can't be trans, and she doesn't understand now why I can still not be cis despite not wanting to get support for it. Can anyone recommend a good way to explain it to her?

(I'm sorry if I come across as ignorant, I just haven't really had anyone to explain how all of this works to me so I'm lost. I don't mean any harm, I'm just not experienced in the LGBT community) 

 I was assigned as a female at birth, but it's not uncommon for me to have days where I sit and look at myself and just don't feel like my body matches who I am? It's hard to explain. Like some days I do enjoy being female and overly cutesy, but other days I can't stand my shape/body and long hair. Is that normal? I don't know what that would be considered. I've also never owned a binder, but since I'm small chested I sometimes cosplay male characters somewhat successfully. I'm ecstatic when I can cosplay male characters from time to time because it just feels right. (Cosplay is the only way my family would allow me to be a male, because as far as they know, I'm just pretending?) I go to college and I'm considering buying a binder so I can wear it to classes on days where I don't feel female to see if it helps.

So I guess if I boil it all down, my main questions are, 

Are there resources to help me figure this out a bit better? I'm really lost on this.

Is there anywhere I can buy a binder in person? My mom can see my amazon. 

Is there a way I can lessen the dislike I feel for my body when I don't feel female?

I've thought about starting testosterone but I'm so scared that I'm wrong about my gender identity. What if I transition and then realize I prefer being female? I have the same fears with top surgery. 

I have also lived in a emotionally abusive household all my life so I'm worried that what I feel isn't gender dysphoria and instead just me hating myself. 

I've always hated my name for a slue of reasons and I never really felt like my name was me. I unofficially changed my name to a more gender neutral name and I feel more connected to that name then my birth name but I still worry that the reason for that is growing up in an abusive house. 

Honestly, I'm just scared to start transitioning because I don't identify as female but I also don't identify as male so how do I know for sure what I want my body to be? What if I regret becoming more masculine?

Since I have now been living ""The Transgender Experience (TM)"" for a couple of years now, I've gotten pretty familiar with the tropes around being a trans girl, such as:

obsession with pickles (which I don't personally share), and salt (which I do)

becoming a cat girl

diminished libido, possibly to the point of becoming asexual

the fact that many trans girl names end up sounding like cyberpunk hackers

But I must admit I have literally only a few trans masc friends and I don't talk to them/hang out with them/see their memes nearly as much as those relevant to my own experience.

The ones I know of are:

Jayden, Kayden, Hayden

that a lot of trans guys pick names that sound like drowned victorian boys (Oliver, Elliott, Elijah)

that trans guys love protein and bananas

I thought it would be nice to share places I have bought shoes from her as well as create a list from everyone else's recommendations as well in the hopes that someone would be able to google ""shoes for trans women"" and find a comprehensive list! So here goes:

* [Syro](http://shopsyro.com/) - A queer owned independent shoe company
* Amazon - Searching women's shoes by size has been very helpful in finding basics such as flats or sandals 
* Nordstrom and Depop are also great places to search by size!  
* Dr.Martins - A classic for unisex shoes
* Sneakers - Converse, Superga, Adidas, Nike, etc.


I know this is basic but please comment with more suggestions. Especially independent companies or lines by queer and trans people

1066,2019-08-22 12:33:57,ctwsub,2,9,"Hello /r/trans, long time listener, recently first time poster here, and I want to discuss something that I think I have just started to figure out.

There is no correct way that I am aware of to talk about this, so let's starting talking about it incorrectly.

I frequently feel like I read, and am exposed to a ""no my dysphoria is worse than yours, I've felt it longer, and it damaged me more, you just don't understand.""

I cannot even begin to describe how this affected me negatively for years, and please hear me out, because this one is important. 

I've made the following observations from my own experiential perspective:

* You doubt whether or not you are 'real' enough. You question whether or not, despite how strongly you feel, if maybe you have a lesser 'claim' to being trans, even worse you can begin to self doubt tremendously because maybe you didn't feel like slitting your wrists every day, or maybe you didn't know since you were trans your whole life like some of us magically figure out - please remember that each person's journey is personal, gender identity is personal, and each person is going to present and feel differently
* You become afraid to take any action or even speak in the community, despite the fact that much of the trans community is supportive, sometimes it also feels like, at least MtF side, a bit like a backbiting bitches club where everyone acts all accepting in their face, and behind their backs are just...well...not so supportive, and what scares me is that I have this part of myself that feels competitive in this regard to other women / transwomen, but I actively try to control it
* I think I know why this happens though, and I'm not sure it can be helped. People who are trans, we all feel the need to make a 'case' for ourselves which is less about the trans community internally, and more about to the world at large. We're constantly faced  with questions about our validity, and even being able to medically transition requires so much to be in place,m least of which is someone who can believe you enough to write a prescription or 4 
* I think that trans people are just also in a fight or flight mode at the beginning, that we become combative and insecure - before coming out to myself I felt reasonably rock solid about several things, but now, I'm so much 'weaker'.

I was hoping to have a dialog because I want to make the following points for whomever this applies:

* I get it, you're hurting, but try to, if you can, be more supportive because we're all stronger together
* Try to be as honest with yourself about how you feel because exaggeration, and not that everyone is exaggerating, especially in the extreme creates an atmosphere of competition. This is like when folks are younger are comparing injuries, calling them battle scars. Maybe Terry has had five broken ribs and survived an encounter with Fox News, but Cindy used to wrestle alligators in the Australian outback, and yet still, each journey is valid so let's try to support, not-outcompete.

To conclude my initial thoughts:

* Gender dysphoria is not an episodes long stretch of DragonBall Z where we should be charging up and battling for a season
* Supporting each other is key, please understand that the consequences of doing this can actually lead to inaction in others, or even worse, a feeling of rejection and false invalidity
* Please love each other",trans,"Let's frame why a 'gender dysphoria contest' appears to be so pervasive in our communities, and have a discussion about the consequences",1566502437.0,"{'created_utc': 1566477237, 'id': 'ctwsub', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'Hello /r/trans, long time listener, recently first time poster here, and I want to discuss something that I think I have just started to figure out.\n\nThere is no correct way that I am aware of to talk about this, so let\'s starting talking about it incorrectly.\n\nI frequently feel like I read, and am exposed to a ""no my dysphoria is worse than yours, I\'ve felt it longer, and it damaged me more, you just don\'t understand.""\n\nI cannot even begin to describe how this affected me negatively for years, and please hear me out, because this one is important. \n\nI\'ve made the following observations from my own experiential perspective:\n\n* You doubt whether or not you are \'real\' enough.

As of the last two weeks my feelings of Gender Dysphoria have been absolutely unbearable. I am currently dependent upon my parents for housing and college tuition. They are already accepting of me as a Bisexual male, however, it is still a sensitive subject and it took a year for them to process. They are both fairly conservative christians who don't see eye to eye with the LGBT community very well, but they are not against us. My parents approach to my sexuality is ""I love you no matter what and you can love who you want, however I will not support you with this"". 

I am looking to discuss my gender dysphoria with them to seek help from a secular therapist before the end of next week. My dysphoria has only been getting worse and with College starting this Monday I need to be able to lift the depression, anxiety, and discomfort as much as possible. 

I myself do not know how to come out like this. I do not know how to tell my parents that my masculinity makes me feel awful and that I want to be able to change it. Any advice, support, or kind words are greatly appreciated.

1108,2019-08-23 03:34:54,cu8c09,1,3,"Hey all, a friend of mine has recently mentioned to me that she is dealing with gender dysphoria, which she believes to be the reason behind her severe depression and anxiety (she’s mtf pre-transition). I talked with her about how she’s feeling, we talked about her mental health a bit (I’ve had mental health issues in the past so we talked about that, I tried to offer support, etc) and - as she’s got anxiety - I offered to look into resources/communities/etc for her, which she said yes to (though she wasn’t very optimistic).

She’s *very* anxious and doesn’t feel comfortable at all in her body (hence the depression), so she’s been avoiding going out at all. She’s been encouraged by her doctor to try and socialise IRL (and I’ve said to keep socialising online when she’s not up to it IRL) but her doctor apparently didn’t want to address the dysphoria at all. She’s not currently working due to her mental health and doesn’t think that she’s able to start transitioning just yet (I think this is a location and money thing, not necessarily a safety thing?? though I’m going to clarify that with her just to be sure).

I’m just wondering whether anyone is able to offer some advice/suggestions on:

• things she can start doing that might help her feel more at home in her body prior to her starting to transition (I wondered whether I should suggest she start painting her nails - even if it’s just clear or skin coloured? I don’t know if that’s a stupid suggestion or not..) 

• any trans resources/support/communities in the panhandle of Florida region? (What the hell even is a panhandle?? I’m guessing that’s a big area to work with? I don’t have anything more specific sorry!)

• trans friendly / aware doctors in the same region

1110,2019-08-23 03:46:12,cu8gc3,14,2,"So, my whole life I have been in the closet and just recently came out as gay. I was never aroused by girls growing up, but I've been drawn towards more feminine men since I was an early teen. Always the softer guys, with the bit of a voice and funny walk (you know what I'm talking about). Id get butterflies in the stomach, knees made of jelly, the whole nine when talking to guys like that. I'm not at all into macho guys, beefy or overtly manly, not in the slightest. But the more efeminine men, I would just melt for these guys. 

I spent my whole life running from my attractions and sexuality, away from the shame of those feelings. However after having embraced my sexuality, I've had a few interesting talks and have read some things here in Reddit that have given me pause. Most of my life I had never actually known a trans person, but over the past few years I've met a couple. 

So I'm attracted to effeminate men, but I've also found myself attracted to the several transwomen I've met. I assume its because they also put forth feminine characteristics that I'm attracted to in men, even being those men themselves before they started transitioning.

I'm not sexually aroused by a biological woman, however I am towards the transwomen I've known. But I also know most transwomen fully identify themselves as their presented gender. Would a trans woman be offended that a gay man showed attraction towards her? Would she find it problematic that I am attracted to her, but also identify as gay and am attracted to men? Is my question making sense?

My whole life in the closet, no one had a clue. I'm totally straight acting. If I was in a relationship with a trans woman, it could easily pass as a straight relationship... except for the whole identifying as gay bit.

I dont know if I am in the right place here to ask this question, but I would love to have some input and answers to questions from people who went trough the same thing.

So where to start.. Im 21 m and live in Germany. For a couple of years I know that I would rather be female than male. In hindsight I had some tendencies as a child aswell I would say 
(like Secretly wearing ""girly"" clothing).

I outed myself as gay to my mother and a couple of close friends when I got 18. I figured at the time this would solve my anxiety and depression if I could just tell my loved ones.
It kind of worked I guess, a huge burden was lifted of my shoulders! around the same time I learned about trans people and the possibility to transition, trough the internet and television. Sadly enough I never knew about any of this earlier.. 

Since then I always had this question in my head if I would be happier as a woman and if I would feel whole and not as empty and like im drowning? 

Im really scared tbh.
Mostly about my family's reaction and if the option would even be available to transition..

I dont even know where to approach a professional about this to evaluate my options with..

Im sorry if any if this text is confusing im scattered right now als dont know where to go or what to do.

Am i too old to Transition into a ""passable"" women ?

Who do i talk to about transitioning?

Would my Healthcare pay for this?
Im broke and jobless at this moment in time and i fear this will make it even harder to get back on my feet.

How did you approach your family about this ?

I am an 18y/o M that has recently been finding out more about my gender and stuff. I am almost 100% sure I am MtF because as a kid I always tried to make friends with girls (being a kid with glasses and a buzzcut till i was 16 didnt help that front). In my spare time I resorted to video games  and avoiding social interactions. In my youth I played many sports including Football, Basketball and Trap Shooting (Dad forced me to). Growing up with 2 sisters I was able to sometimes, when I had the house to myself, try on some of their outfits. I never thought much of it but I would do that 1-2 times a month. 
My life has never made sense to me, I did things and activities that boys around me did, but I was still always so displeased with life. In my journey to try and fix this I have had 3 lovely girlfriends, joined the U.S. Military (kicked out and given Veteran Status for lying about my Major Anxiety ""disorder"") , and made myself into what i considered ""good enough"" looking. 
Alas, none of that filled my void.
When my last girlfriend and were together I came out as bi to her and my 2nd eldest sister (only person that wont put me in another mental hospital). Coming out as bi to them was so empowering and really gave me hope for my future. Soon after we broke up I was having really bad anxiety and the only thing that was able to calm me was wearing a pair of Jeggings (my only female clothes) and browsing website after website of clothes, makeup and things that I had always been told ""Arent for my gender"".
Exploring into this more I have been trying to get more info and I am also trying to start hormones.
If there is anyone in MN that is willing to help me with this I would appreciate that a ton, I have never been good at looking for what I want because I have never known what I want. But now I know that I want to be a female.
Good place for HRT in mn?
Any help group chats?
Anyone willing to kind of ""mentor"" me in the ways of MtF?
Thank you!

I need help... no. My friend needs help.  
I need help helping her.  


We met on a website to meet penpals.   
She never had a great self confidence and self esteem. Never. She thinks she's awkward and when her ""friends"" don't let her down, she repels them.   


She already did this to me, she got angry at me and trying to push me away saying mean things she doesn't believe in (except maybe when she talks about herself). Little does she know I'm an alligator and locked my jawbone on her, I'm not letting her go. I knew she felt shitty about all she said, and she was so much convinced I would give her up she did that a lot of times.  


she dreams about studying abroad and becoming a really cute girl, comming out and being able to be herself, to stop lying.

We've been talking for  more than a year.  
So, here what happened.  


Before then, we were only texting to each other (via discord) but about a month ago, we called for the first time . We were pretty much excited, and earing her being so happy just got me even more excited. We kept talking and talking for hours, you know how it goes, two blabbermouth talking together.... But that day, I offered her to send her a few of my old dresses and jewelery, even to make her a dress with my old lab coat, even despite the cost of the shipping france/philippines, for her birthday on december.   


but for that she had to come out first to her familly.   


I encouraged her to take her time and come out when she's ready, but one day, she could not bear it anymore. She told her parents, and it went quite well  


So we thought.   
She was sooo happy. For a few days she was trying to get her mother used to her being ""girly"" but her mother kept saying ""don't feel forced to do that"", and such but I believed she would get used to it and finally accept her as who she is.   


Until the day she sent me this:  


 ""I apologize  
You are someone who is poisoning my minds it seems  
Telling me to be someone I'm not (a girl)  
So I don't want to talk anymore  
Goodbye""  


I was mad as hell. I knew she would never be sending me those kind of messages. I was mad about her familly forcing her to do that.  


So we made one step backward.  
Her self esteem got once again hit.

we keep talking.

and now, she has to leave the philippines to finally be her

but if we don't find a school and a country where she can easily go, she'll have to stay there, closeted, not only for her own safety, but because she won't be accepted  


but, like I said, I'm an alligator.   


She doesn't have a lot of time, so I'm searching countries and universities where she could go to.  
Can you help me  


1) She CAN become cute, even with her wide shoulders and stuff, help me show that to her, please, even if it's not right now  


2) the other thing I need help for...  
Is a little more complicated, so, please, don't feel obligated to do this.  
I created a google doc, there is a chart where I Sort countries depending on:

\-if it's grsm friendly (more trans friendly)

\-hrt and trans support in this country

\-cost of life

\-travel cost (philippine to this place)

\-how to get in

\-universities

\-language

\-scolarship ans such

I can share the google doc with you. (just DM me)

I can honestly do that alone, but it will take time

Any bit of help is welcome

I'm asking that for her, she feels like she's a bother to need my help, but in an other way she doesnt have the time (between her school and everything else she has to do)

1265,2019-08-26 18:12:58,cvrsho,0,3,"Hello......

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I was AMAB, but I've been questioning my gender identity since January. Lots of experimentation with cross dressing, lots of research, lots of soul searching, etc. I've been attending Transgender meetings at the local LGBTQ center. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago, I figured out that I am pretty much just a straight guy who has a very strong feminine side. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I had already got pulled into an LGBTQ group at church. Somehow they got the idea that I was getting ready to medically transition and they were trying to hook me up with a local transgender medical center. I told them that I was still in ""figuring this stuff out"" mode, but I appreciated the sentiment. Since they were trying to do a seminar series on transgender issues, I offered to help develop some of the material since I am a teacher and am experienced with designing curriculum. 

I just got the text this morning that they were taking me up on my offer. They want to start out with pronouns.

So.....

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Is it appropriate for me to still be doing this? Even though I decided that I'm not transgender. I don't want to be doing any sort of cultural appropriation. That said, the amount that I have learned over the past eight months is incredible, and if I could use my teaching ability to advocate and educate about trans issues, that would be awesome!

Lots of experimentation with cross dressing, lots of research, lots of soul searching, etc. I\'ve been attending Transgender meetings at the local LGBTQ center. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week ago, I figured out that I am pretty much just a straight guy who has a very strong feminine side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I had already got pulled into an LGBTQ group at church. Somehow they got the idea that I was getting ready to medically transition and they were trying to hook me up with a local transgender medical center. I told them that I was still in ""figuring this stuff out"" mode, but I appreciated the sentiment. Since they were trying to do a seminar series on transgender issues, I offered to help develop some of the material since I am a teacher and am experienced with designing curriculum. \n\nI just got the text this morning that they were taking me up on my offer. They want to start out with pronouns.\n\nSo.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) Is it appropriate for me to still be doing this? Even though I decided that I\'m not transgender. I don\'t want to be doing any sort of cultural appropriation. That said, the amount that I have learned over the past eight months is incredible, and if I could use my teaching ability to advocate and educate about trans issues, that would be awesome!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.)

I was questioning my gender (and still am to an extent), and decided to try and make myself feel more fem by shaving my legs and painting my toenails with some polish I stole from my sister. Living with my family and friends meant i needed to keep those choices secret, so i wore pants and socks for weeks at home (tbh i didnt know nail polish remover was a thing then so i though i'd wait it out. 

So here's what happened. I went to a family event where everyone was drinking. Now in Australia the legal drinking age is 18, but with my friends my parents knew i had been drunk before and decided to let me have a few drinks at this relatives house, thinking it was a safe place and they could stop me from getting too fucked up. They were wrong. 

Needless to say I drank waaaaay too much and made an ass out of myself. I woke up the next day in my bed hungover, showered, in clean clothes, and with no memory of the night before after 9pm. 

Later my mom came into my room and told me what happened. Apparently I got so drunk i needed to be carried to the car, then proceeded to throw up on myself. My mum then told me she made me take a shower before going to bed.

It was at this moment I knew I fucked up. I quickly looked under my blanket and realised I wasnt wearing socks and my bright pink toenails were exposed. She told me she saw them and my legs and wanted to talk to me about it, but I was terrified and hungover so I said we would talk it all over later.

When we did start talking, she assumed I was gay and wanted to calm me down a bit because I was trembling from telling her. When I corrected her and told her I was still attracted to women, but I thought I was trans she was stunned. She seemed supportive that night, but for about a week later whenever we were alone she would tell me she didnt think I was trans and it was a phase, that some trans girl changed her mind and regretted hormones and some other shit. 

A couple weeks later I told her I thought she was right and it was a teen phase, and begged her never to tell anyone. A few years later and it turns out I am still confused, but now I'm scared because I know the people I care about most will reject me. 

Im probably not trans, or maybe I am, who knows? I'll sort it out. I just thought some people might have a laugh at my story.

TLDR: Painted my nails, hid them with socks, then threw up all over myself and had to remove them, revealing my inner trans dilemma to my mother and possibly my sister.

So I (22M) recently have been questioning if I'm transgender or not. I think it all started when my mom had a stroke and she went to hospital in November of last year. Like around january the doctors said that she was not doing well and a couple days later i noticed most of her clothes was occupying alot of my closet so I decided to unhang her clothes and put them in a bag to store away in the garage. while I was doing that I was feeling them and noticed how soft they were and decide to wear them and i really enjoyed how they felt and how they looked on me. some of them didn't fit me since I'm overweight so I stopped and I put most clothes in the bag but kept some that did fit. when my dad wasnt home I would wear them around the house. Then like around February I began wanting to buy my own female clothes so I started buying my clothes from thrift shops and then Walmart. At this time I have not told my friends about me dressing up so I would buy and wear female clothes that would pass for guys clothes. I was pretty sad everytime I saw a girl with cute clothes and I couldn't. Then I started getting panties and they were so soft and it felt so much better then boys boxers I fell in love with them. Around April I was at party with friends and I decided to come out to one of my female friends about me wearing female clothing and she was totally ok with it and told me I should tell the rest of my friends since they knew me for years and been friends since a long time and they would accept me. So in the following days I decided to tell my friends one by one and each accepted me about wearing feminine clothing this made me so happy. My female friend helped me out with clothes shopping and explaining different type of clothing. Since then I been wearing more feminine clothes and been more happy since all my friends support me with this. Now recently I about like 2 or 3 months I been starting to be more feminine like act more girly and smell more like a girl I have even started wearing bras which make me feel really happy. Also as well sometimes when I see a girl I sometimes feel kinda jealous about how they look and wish I can look like them. When I look at a picture of naked woman like I wish I can have long hair, have breast, and sometimes when I see a vagina I wish I had a vagina instead of a penis. I have never been happy with my penis because I have always had a really small penis and never been confident with it. Now I recently I been questioning if I am transgender because of that. I have read articles about that I should think about my childhood and I'm not sure if its related but everytime I would play games I would almost never pick Male characters I would always choose female character and in rpg games where I could create a character I would spend so much time creating a female character and enjoy so much dressing them up in cute clothes. I also was always attracted to female clothing and I would mess around acting feminine with my friends. I haven't really felt like I was in the wrong body never really questioned my gender until recently. I'm not even sure if I have gender dysphoria or not.

He’s a cis straight male and I don’t really expect him to know anything about trans issues, and he’s also the kind of person who makes jokes a lot that he doesn’t really mean so I tend to take him with a grain of salt. At the time he didn’t really say anything about it other than that I was probably struggling with confusion and should seek out therapy, which my other roommate promptly scolded him for although tbh I didn’t see it as bad advice. Since then he’s been accepting and hasn’t really made much of a thing about it, but I’m starting to think he might be a little more against it than he lets on. I like to think I have a thick skin but yesterday we got on the subject and he said a few things that kind of upset me.

I don’t remember exactly what got us on the topic but it was something to do with how “unexpected” my desire to transition is. He isn’t the first person to say that among people who knew me prior to all this. I guess I kept it under wraps pretty well. But then he says out of nowhere “Congratulations, you’ve elected to be a third-class citizen. You’ll have to deal with people treating you like shit the rest of your life.” This caught me off guard but I told him that if I was afraid of being ridiculed I wouldn’t have come this far. I let it go and the conversation continued peacefully until we started talking about the future, in a general context not even just about me, and I told him that eventually I’d start going by a female name and pronouns but I would wait until I was ready to start presenting female full time before I asked anyone to do that. 

He says he’s never going to start referring to me differently as he’s known me too long. I thought that was kind of shitty on his part to say something like that but I let it go since right now I’m not ready to do that anyway, but it pissed me off. I kind of just walked away and dropped the issue but I’ve spent the last day processing it.

Knowing him like I do my first instinct is to think that he might just be calling my bluff, i.e. he doesn’t really think I’m going to go through with it. I think he’s not going to say to my face that I’m full of shit but I think he’s thinking it, that this is just a fetish or some kind of meltdown or that I’ll chicken out and tell everyone it was just a phase or something. I *know* I won’t, because I’m just not the kind of person to give up on something important, especially something I’ve come to desire so deeply, but perhaps in his mind he doesn’t see me that way or refuses to.

At the end of the day I know I can’t get inside his head without calling him out and potentially starting a fight with him about it but that just doesn’t seem worth the effort yet. In the end I really don’t know what he’s thinking, but I’m hoping I can bring him around to seeing me as I am, yet right now I don’t think that’s possible. Some of you would probably say I don’t have anything to prove to him and you’re not wrong but at the same time he’s done a lot for me over the years and I value his friendship, enough to be disappointed if it blows up in my face in the end.

1363,2019-08-28 14:48:32,cwlti1,0,18,"A friend suggested I tell a story here about an experience getting medical treatment at the ER. TLDR at the bottom. 

To start off, here is a bit of information about me and the time that this all happened went down. *(If you don't care, you don't have to read this part, its not dyer to the story, I just think it sets the mood for the type of mindset I was in at the time)* I'll start by saying I'm an FtM and I am Pre-t and Pre-op at the time. So about a month and a half before this I had fallen into a ***DEEP*** depression, after coming out to my mom and she ended up not being very supportive but tolerating me enough because we lived together (we still do), but because of the living situation I was constantly miss gendered and dead named by my mom purposely every day in an attempt to ""try to snap me out of this phase."" as she called it. She'd often go out of her way to throw in false pronouns in daily conversation, as well as repeating my dead name as many times as she could fit in a sentence. which you can imagine made me so depressed. And because I was so depressed I wasn't taking the time to try and present myself as male, because just getting out of bed in the morning was a chore in itself. I hadn't cut my hair in a few months so it was long, binders were a chore to get on and off, I was wearing my packer as a desperate cling to feel masculine it worked a bit, I was a complete wreck and it just added extreme Dysphoria on top of my depression. And on top of all this my normal depression medication that i’d been on for ***YEARS*** had stopped working right and ended up with me struggling to get through daily life without the need to take excessive breaks throughout the day to lay in bed and just sleep (My meds would eventually stop working altogether a few months later but that isn't important for the story) ***BUT*** at the time I had just met another FtM male (who at the time was trying to figure out their gender out) who I had the biggest crush on at the time and they basically talked to me every day and made me have a tiny shred of light in my very dark sheltered world that they were slowly trying to help me out of it and at the time of this, I was getting better slowly.  


Now onto the story 

I was having seriously bad pains in my lower back to my sides, I immediately recognized this as kidney stones pains because 1. I was prone to them, 2 I had about 6 of them before this one, and 3 because of the depression I wasn't exactly watching what I was eating/drinking and just grabbed whatever I could grab quickly and get back in my room away from everyone so it lead me to drinking a lot of soda and processed meat which I knew fully well cause me to have kidney stones but i didn’t care it was all just food to me.Well after putting up with it for almost a day in a half just writhing in pain because I didn't want to ask mom to drive me to the ER, along with knowing for sure I’d get misgendered the whole time, and the fact I didn't even want to leave the house at this point. But eventually I caved from the pain and asked my mom to take me to the ER, she agreed and off we went. I was still marked female on all of my documents, so while it didn't surprise me hearing “***Miss*** \*dead name\*” it still stung a bit. And, after all the horror stories I read on trans right with health care not being good, I was too scared to correct them and feared being treated differently because of it, so I just let it happened. During our almost 8hr nearly 9hr visit that they did and lab work, blood work, everything the need to do all why addressing me as she/her and my dead name. and knowing full well it was Kidney stones I was terrified they'd have to look or even worse touch ***there*** because I had been wearing my packer that day, I knew I would have to take it off for them to examine me as well as show my non supportive mom it was there. It was a mess! ***I was a mess!*** Lucky for me they didn't need to Crisis avoided. So, by the end of my 8hr trip you can imagine how exhausted I was and I just wanted the end of the visit so I could lay down and cry. My mom left to use the bathroom and she told me she was going to bring the car around so I didn't have to walk that far the parking lot was packed so we parked a long way back. So she left. And a Male nurse get ready to prepare me for discharged. I figured they had treated me already there was nothing more they could legally do to me. So exhausted and defeated, I turned to the male nurse who was prepping me and pretty sure with tears in my eyes and defeated look on my face I stuttered out quietly ""can you address me as he/him"" And he paused, looked at me,then smiled and nodded saying ""sure, I can definitely do that"" and the entire time of Getting my IV out, vitals checked one last time and signing papers consenting to being released and all that  the rest of the time he was preparing me to be discharged he used he/him pronouns and after telling him my name (Tommy) he addressed me as that. It was just a small gesture but it made me feel so much better and accepted by a total stranger and because of the small gesture. I’m less afraid about alerting doctors/nurses that i’m Transgender

I was still marked female on all of my documents, so while it didn\'t surprise me hearing “***Miss*** \\*dead name\\*” it still stung a bit. And, after all the horror stories I read on trans right with health care not being good, I was too scared to correct them and feared being treated differently because of it, so I just let it happened. During our almost 8hr nearly 9hr visit that they did and lab work, blood work, everything the need to do all why addressing me as she/her and my dead name. and knowing full well it was Kidney stones I was terrified they\'d have to look or even worse touch ***there*** because I had been wearing my packer that day, I knew I would have to take it off for them to examine me as well as show my non supportive mom it was there. It was a mess! ***I was a mess!*** Lucky for me they didn\'t need to Crisis avoided. So, by the end of my 8hr trip you can imagine how exhausted I was and I just wanted the end of the visit so I could lay down and cry. My mom left to use the bathroom and she told me she was going to bring the car around so I didn\'t have to walk that far the parking lot was packed so we parked a long way back. So she left. And a Male nurse get ready to prepare me for discharged. I figured they had treated me already there was nothing more they could legally do to me. So exhausted and defeated, I turned to the male nurse who was prepping me and pretty sure with tears in my eyes and defeated look on my face I stuttered out quietly ""can you address me as he/him"" And he paused, looked at me,then smiled and nodded saying ""sure, I can definitely do that"" and the entire time of Getting my IV out, vitals checked one last time and signing papers consenting to being released and all that  the rest of the time he was preparing me to be discharged he used he/him pronouns and after telling him my name (Tommy) he addressed me as that. It was just a small gesture but it made me feel so much better and accepted by a total stranger and because of the small gesture. I’m less afraid about alerting doctors/nurses that i’m Transgender  \n\n\nidk where your life took you too nurse dude, but thank you for making me feel comfortable and accepted', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Treatment I Received At The ER.', 'created': 1567028912.0}"

TW: possible dysphoria.

I've thought I might be the last couple of years more so than I ever had before, but I'm worried I'm not right? Since I was little I never thought of myself of a girl and would lean towards masculine things, like wearing boys clothes, playing with boy toys and ultimately realizing I liked girls.

I've also never felt comfortable with my body, I hate my breasts and don't like looking like a girl. Sex isn't triggering for me though oddly enough, although I always imagine myself with male parts while having sex.

(List ordered by class period) 

1st- My choir teacher acknowledged the email and started calling me Alex in class. She gave no verbal or email response. 

2nd- this teacher had already been calling me Alex (she great) and apparently sent me an email but it didn’t send through and she’s gonna show me it tomorrow. (Cause A and B days y’all) 

3rd- She gave me a “thanks for telling me” email and is calling me Alex. 

4th- Now he gave me a verbal response and in that conversation (he said he was bad with names) said “I don’t think I need to worry about talking to your parents” he is calling me Alex and here the attendance thing. He called Alex and my brain didn’t register that was me so it took a hit second and then the people at my table looked at me like I have 3 heads. Peers will be the biggest issue when it comes to being trans. Cause you know Texas. 

5th- My coach is apart of the GRSM (lgbt) community. She said (in an email that also didn’t send through wtf google) that she was proud that I felt confident enough to tell my teachers. :)

6th- yeah she just calls me Alex. No response just acknowledgement. 

7th- Was already out to this teacher yeet still sent her the email. Got an email back. 

8th- I don’t even know if he read the email cause he still deadnames me. And if coach lettuce (no that’s not his real last name. He’s the teacher from 4th period) can remember my name so would he. Also totally drew a trans flag in my assignment today let’s hope that goes well.

Here is what happened. However if I can sum it up all went well. \n\n(List ordered by class period) \n\n1st- My choir teacher acknowledged the email and started calling me Alex in class. She gave no verbal or email response. \n\n2nd- this teacher had already been calling me Alex (she great) and apparently sent me an email but it didn’t send through and she’s gonna show me it tomorrow. (Cause A and B days y’all) \n\n3rd- She gave me a “thanks for telling me” email and is calling me Alex. \n\n4th- Now he gave me a verbal response and in that conversation (he said he was bad with names) said “I don’t think I need to worry about talking to your parents” he is calling me Alex and here the attendance thing. He called Alex and my brain didn’t register that was me so it took a hit second and then the people at my table looked at me like I have 3 heads. Peers will be the biggest issue when it comes to being trans. Cause you know Texas. \n\n5th- My coach is apart of the GRSM (lgbt) community. She said (in an email that also didn’t send through wtf google) that she was proud that I felt confident enough to tell my teachers. :)\n\n6th- yeah she just calls me Alex. No response just acknowledgement. \n\n7th- Was already out to this teacher yeet still sent her the email. Got an email back. \n\n8th- I don’t even know if he read the email cause he still deadnames me. And if coach lettuce (no that’s not his real last name. He’s the teacher from 4th period) can remember my name so would he. Also totally drew a trans flag in my assignment today let’s hope that goes well. \n\nNeedless to say my favorite class(I’ve got 3 friends in there with no seating chart) has my least favorite teacher.

This is just a kinda dumb rant, but it's something I think of every time I see one of those posts about someone struggling with their mood post transition. I think a lot of people have this misconception that transitioning is a panacea for trans people. It's not. 

And all I really want to say is that that's okay and normal to keep struggling.

I've spent reasonable chunks of my life traveling, and one thing I've learned is that I always bring my brain with me. I never leave it behind. There's just no way. You always bring yourself with you. There's no escaping that.

And like for me, in my post transition life, I finally began to recognize myself in mirrors and feel good about my appearance. I also became addicted to cutting and have even attempted to end my life on several occasions. Because the truth of the matter is that I have mental health issues that no amount of positive body image is going to cure.

And that's okay.

It's okay to keep struggling. It's okay for things in general to get worse even. That's just life. But if you're happy with your transition, independent of anything else and whatever that looks like, then you're trans enough. It doesn't need to fix your whole life to be valid.

1392,2019-08-29 00:41:59,cwtjoe,3,8,"hi, i'm 38, i am a wife of 18 years and a mom to four fantastic kids.

ok so let's back way up. I came out as a lesbian in my teens. I had no attraction to guys whatsoever. By 17 years old i was fully passing as a male. 

wait let me go back even more and say that i have never worn a dress. Never. I have never worn makeup. Never. I've never worn heels, never gotten my nails done. I've been wearing man's boxers as underpants for as long as i can remember. The only exception is a bra because i have large breasts that need restrained.

speaking of breasts, i absolutely despise having them. I am very grateful that nature allowed me to breastfeed my children, that was an amazing thing i got to experience and the whole being pregnant thing rocked my world, amazing, but i did not give birth to my children, they were all c-sections, so i never got to do the womanly giving birth thing. I don't know if that's relevant but i've never been a fan of my girl parts so not having to push a child out of them was fine by me.

ok so at 17 you would not have known i was a girl during the colder months. In summer it became obvious because i couldn't hide my breasts. I used a non gendered name and all was good.

when i was 21 i met a man, he became my best friend and in time my lover. He is now my husband of 18 years, and still my absolutely favourite person in the world.  He has always been aware that i am not sexually attracted to men (yes, we have sex, we make it work). He knows i only wear mens clothing. He helps me keep my head shaved short. He loves me despite never having seen me shave my pits or legs. He knows i often get mistaken for a man, he's watched me get kicked out of womens washrooms more than once!  He knows i hate my breasts. He has never (not once in 18+ years) called me by my birth name.

ok so now that i've gotten all that out of the way, i'm ready to take the next step. I am ready to live my life fully as a man. I am ready. I need this.

But i am a wife, and a mother, and i don't want to lose that part of me, i don't want to take that part of me away from my husband, i don't want to not be mom anymore. But i do want to be me.

my husband won't ever leave me and my children would support me 100%

but i dont know. I just dont know.

i don't mind being called a woman, ma'am, she, her, etc.  I don't feel like a lady but i don't care of other people call me that. I've been called sir plenty of times too and to be honest i'm not sure which one feels more right.

i don't even know what the point of my post is. I guess just validation, i need some kind of validation. I'm scared to tell my husband because i dont want to change the life we have built together. My family is beautiful, but it would be just as beautiful if i were a man too.

I need some advice. 
Should I come out?

Pros: 
I could use preferred bathrooms at school, use preferred name and be in the boys group for field trips.
I would be able to buy masculine clothing without fear of being outted.
I could get a binder without saying it's just a sports bra.

Cons: 
Parents may not accept me (most worried about my dad. He's manipulative and emotionally abusive)
May be forced to go to conversion therapy (slim chance but still)
May be forced to be more femme instead of tomboyish like how they currently see me as.
People at school may find out (brother is a gossip whore) and thus I may get bullied, since the teachers can't help with that.
May have my phone (only access to my accepting friends) taken away even though I paid for it


I don't know if I should come out. Over all I would be happier, maybe? But at the same time I may not be allowed to be myself for another 3-5 years until I move out. Please give me advice on what you would do in this situation!

1437,2019-08-29 20:12:02,cx66x1,0,1,"I regularly interact with people who don’t think they are transphobic but make statements that are wildly offensive (surprise!). 

For instance, one person (who I care about and would prefer to discuss this with instead of jet them from my life if possible) thinks that being trans is a choice. He also thinks that trans people “are not allowed to get offended if I mistakenly refer to them” by the wrong pronouns. Or aren’t allowed to get offended... period? Of course, this person is awfully offended himself about something he clearly doesn’t know much about.

He says he doesn’t know any trans people, but is convinced that “they” all get “too offended” about who knows what... everything? It’s terrible.

I told him that it feels like he’s created an imaginary “us vs them” dynamic and decided that “they” are somehow coming after him or his sensibilities. That people are just people, and if “their” lives haven’t intersected with his, or if no one has become incensed with him yet... maybe live and let live? Just yesterday this person was very excited that one of his favorite musicians made a statement about how war sucks, that we all as humans just want the same thing at the end of the day, to live and feed children and all that jazz. I asked how this does this not apply to trans people too, especially considering that said musician is an outspoken trans ally.

I feel like I must have communicated my points poorly, or been upset or something that distracted from the discussion when talking about it. It just wasn’t clicking for him. So I thought I’d ask this sub for some advice on how to calm these “they’re taking mah freedoms” types down and talk to them. Maybe what to say, or how to say it?

If someone I care about ends up just being a bigoted ass at the end of the day, fuck that, they’re out of my life.

I'm AMAB but in recent months and years have been finding myself a lot more drawn to feminine things. From little things like playing as female characters in video games and DnD to wishing I could take more major steps like wear feminine clothing, shave my body hair, or start using new pronouns. I can't tell if this is me starting to realize I'm some sort of trans or nonbinary, but for a long time I just haven't been able to shake the feeling that I would have been happier or better off if I'd been born a girl. 

I sometimes feel varying levels of dysphoria from doing traditionally masculine things and I feel really happy doing some of the things I described above. Transitioning isn't really an option or something I've given serious consideration to--financials are an issue, as well as a family that almost certainly would think I was crazy--but I sometimes find myself wishing that I could.

My names Journey/Strixie. I'm a cis female. I have trouble making and maintaining friends in real life so I hang out on Discord a lot. (TL;DR at the end)  
A while ago, a server was deleted because some toxicity was going on, and the owner just couldn't take it anymore. But me and my friends missed it and made an attempt to revive it. It was going great. The new owner really liked Fire Emblem and liked to pretend to be various characters. One day, they made a new account and pretended to be the character Tiki and jokingly made their gender role ""dragon"". Two people; one was a trans man and the other was his best friend, told them it was transphobic and calmly asked them to not do that. They simply responded, ""ok"" and changed it. But then they asked if they wanted to know why. ""Tiki"" said, ""f\*\*innn like, leave me alone""  
To me, they seemed kind of annoyed. They had done what they wanted and got rid of the role but their fun had been a bit ruined. One of them said, ""we're not bullying you, sweetie"" the other pointed out that it sounded rude. This was when everything got out of control.  
Tiki had stopped responding. I don't know for sure, but I think the person behind the Tiki account might be genderfluid. They really support the trans community. In another server, they said they felt terrible and sick of themselves for acting transphobic.  
Meanwhile, on the first server, two other people joined(one of whom is an enemy of mine but that issue has nothing to do with transgender and their very presence made everything a whole lot worse). Because Tiki had never responded or apologized, they made her out to be a transphobic asshole. And I kid you not, they started insulting her and the rest of the server. Including, ""Who are those oversensitive witches who insult others but cry when you correct them? Or wait, that's half this server"" Tiki said, ""I literally wanted to make a Fire Emblem joke and I can't even- like *W H E E Z E*"" My nemesis said the same thing she always says when she ~~doesn't want to realize she's being an overly sensitive a\*\*hole~~ 's mad ""saying it's a joke is the oldest trick in the book. Another person said, ""Hey, Tiki! Your the why people don't take the trans community seriously, uwu. Gender identity is nothing to joke about, uwu."" Another said, ""what do you have say, Tiki? It's like I have to treat you like a kindergartener."" And later, they said, ""Tiki's suspiciously not responding a lot.""  
Again, back to that other server, the person controlling the Tiki account is visibly upset about what these people are saying and doesn't know what to say.   
At this point, I see what's going on and say that their harshness is completely unnecessary and that it was the reason why Tiki wasn't responding. I say that Tiki just wanted to play. As if it was a ""you're either with them or against them"" scenario, *I* get called transphobic for defending Tiki. Other members of the server were the same. Saying Tiki didn't mean to offend them and understand their joke was read as offensive. But we all agreed that this behavior was uncalled for.  
These people continued to tell Tiki to apologize but that account was offline. To quote one, ""Say sorry you pathetic piece of dog shit. You avoiding us is as radiating as much bitch energy as we are so tough up and own up."" They continued to say that Tiki ignored them even though they clearly didn't. They said that Tiki was truly sorry, they would've apologized.   
I say that everyone responds differently. And, from my personal experience with *one certain person here* it wouldn't even matter if you said so the first time because sorry doesn't mean anything. This somehow stopped though. Don't ask me how, though. I don't know.  
Oh end, no happily ever after. The server was doing perfectly okay 'til this shit went do and 90% yeeted out of there.  
TL;DR: Someone made a joke that ended up offending some LGBTQ+ people. They fixed their mistake but came off as a bit bitchy and ended up getting a wave of terrible and uncalled for insults hurled at them.  
I talked to the people involved. One person believes gender is not something to be joked about. I don't really believe that, though. People get to joke about a lot of things that probably shouldn't be joked about. I understand if you don't like it, though. And I totally see where they're coming from because people poke fun at trans people. That only causes them to suffer.  
I talked to them, and the person behind Tiki genuinely feels terrible.  
I'm honestly confused. Did Tiki deserve the hate they got? Is it okay to joke about gender?  
I feel a bit transphobic now because of how sensitive everyone was but I understand where their coming from.

I see someone so amazing and strong that I can’t help but smile and silently think to myself “good job”. I want to tell you I’m proud of you. I want you to know I think about you on a daily basis. I don’t know you, and I probably never will. But you bet your ass I support you and will stand prepared to uphold your basic human rights when they are challenged. I will never bend to the preconceived narrative that all republicans must hate you. I will always challenge these ideas. If you are scared to use the bathroom I will go with you because it’s insane that you even have to fear what could lie outside the stall. I want you to know that you are loved. I want you to know that you are not scary, you are not disgusting, you are not crazy, you are not broken, you are not damaged and most of all you are not a freak. You deserve love and respect just as much as anyone else. You are amazing and always will be. You are brave and don’t let anyone tell you you’re not. To my trans sisters, I hope you buy and wear that dress. You will look amazing. I hope you style your hair how you like. I hope you master that makeup look you’ve always wanted to do. I hope you get that killer manicure, and I hope you strut like the diva queen you were born to be. To my trans brothers, You look so handsome in the suit with your tie all fixed. That fresh new cut feeling will never get old, and you kill that look. Don’t be afraid to buy the spongebob boxers.

(1) The second month has been quite slow, No real changes that I have noticed.

(2) The mirror is a strange thing. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of her, sometimes I can't see any of her.

(3) Facial hair, I have a shitty home laser that I am using. It is working but really really slowly. I am sure with enough time it will succeed. i don't know if I can wait that long.

(4) Breast development: they have grown. they are like fat man moobs. But very big LOL. I have no female nipples yet. I tried measuring my cup size I got 32C (this is obviously wrong if I lie down they disappear)

(5) I don't femme up since staring HRT. I am waiting until I know HRT helps me look better. I don't want to see pre HRT me in womens clothes.

（6） I thought I had escaped the emotional changes. on a few occasions I have felt like bursting into tears.  this is understandable it is really tough transitioning for us all.

(7) I am into girls, I am meeting girls on chinese dating sites. one asked me for my photo. (to prove I was English) I panicked. So i just sent the top half of my face and blurred out my laser shadowed fucked up bottom half of my face. I passed LOL.

(8) Voice training- I am doing ok, I am way off, lots to do and I can't flip to a new voice for 2 years anyway, i will change it as much as I can.

(9) I really don't know how fucked my hair line is lol. I know it is thin on top. I can see new hairs growing I think.

(10) HRT meds became a little tricky to get. This could be a problem in the future.

Basically, at one point I wrote a whole letter and gave it to my therapist.  It explained that I want to be a girl, etc, etc.  This therapist helped me tell my parents how I feel.  I asked if I could get surgery over the summer, and my parents said no because it is expensive and because I just recently told them.  I've had hints of gender identity issues since I was five, and I have been sure for about two years.  I know that there are risks, but I'm still sure.  

My biggest issue is this: I don't want to have a slow transition and tell people my new name and so on.  I want to wake up tomorrow as a girl.  I don't want to change my future, I wish my past would change.  I know this isn't possible.  What's the closest thing? Waiting till I am 18 and transition.  Making new friends, and starting a new life.  But, that won't work.  I don't want to forget everyone in my past.  What about my family? What about my friends?

My current plan is thus - talk to my therapist about hormones and eventually surgery, and transition.  This causes me to fear how my fellow students will react.

The final and biggest problem is this.  I can manage as I am now, and I would love to be transitioned, but I fear the middle stages.  I don't want to be seen in my middle stages.  Ideally, I would take a high dosage of hormones starting late in the school year.   Get surgery late in the summer, and return to school as a whole new person.

1525,2019-08-31 05:03:27,cxrzq6,8,16,"First off, I'm a ftm trans masculine person who hasn't undergone any medical transition. I'm socially transitioning and present as a male and have been for months now. I had heard rumors about hair stylists refusing to do trans people's hair, but I'd never imagined that my hair would be ruined the way it was.

What happened is I went to a fairly popular haircutting chain this morning. I checked in and got in line and waited for the one stylist available to finish up the other clients in front of me. She was an older woman, and she finished up the two men before me fairly quickly, and their hair ended up decent enough.

I had two pictures with me of two different styles I liked. I had wanted long bangs for years, and so I spent over six months growing out all of my hair until it reached shoulder length. It was long, thick, and perfect for the kind of bangs I wanted to have.

The woman called me over, washed my hair, then asked me what I wanted to do to my hair. I showed her the two pictures, and she said that one of the styles I was considering wouldn't work well with my rounder face, and so I told her I wanted the other one, and she agreed to do it. Keep in mind, the picture was of a butch woman with the cut I wanted, that'll be important later. Once we'd agreed, the stylist had me remove my glasses so she could cut my hair (a regular occurance when I get a trim or haircut). She began hacking away at my hair, and I knew she had fucked up my bangs. I just didn't realize how much until much too late.

She finished cutting my hair, dried it with a hairdrier, then handed me my glasses to look at the end result.

I was horrified. She'd chopped off way too much hair, my bangs barely had an inch covering my face, and it was a woman's pixie cut. Nothing like I had asked for from her.

I had to fight back tears as I told her, ""This isn't the haircut that I asked for.""

She only laughed and said, ""That was a man's haircut! You can't have that, you're a girl!""

I repeated what I had said two more times, making it pretty obvious I was unhappy with what she had done to me, but she only repeated what she had told me. Then she fluffed my hair up to make it look larger and said, ""Look! I made you look cuter than before!""

She made me pay for the hack job she had done on my hair, and I practically ran from the shop, close to tears.

I walked a few shops over to a nail salon my mother was getting a pedicure at and as soon as I walked in as she was paying, she knew it was nothing like the photo I had showed her. She finished paying then we walked to the car, and I burst into tears. She had no clue what to do. All of my hair was gone, on the floor in the haircutting place I had just left. I had no more than three to four inches of hair on the top of my head left to work with, and I didn't know what to do.

My mom and I drove to my sister's house, and she got to work trying to salvage my hair. It wasn't that the haircut itself was bad, as it could look nice on someone who wanted it like that! But I hadn't wanted anything like that, and so my sister is scheduling me an appointment with her stylist, and we've emailed corporate, left a review on Yelp, and on Google Reviews (which was deleted not ten hours after posting). If I don't get a reply to my email by the end of a week, I'm going public with what happened and posting it on Facebook as a way to warn others.

I feel disgusted, belittled, and I'm currently trying to fix what's happened to my hair, something that I've always held a lot of pride in. The stylist could have told me walking in that she wouldn't give me the cut I wanted, and I've had left and found another place to go to and gotten the haircut I wanted, but instead, she ruined my hair, then refused to fix it, made me pay, and made me feel horrible about myself.

Be careful where you get your hair done, my friends. I know hair can be a big part of your transition, and this has left me feeling horrible.

I had asked them over the phone if they take Medicaid, which is my secondary insurance, and they said they didn't, but they did take my primary insurance, so they'd just take that. So yesterday, I had an appointment with the doctor to get my blood drawn to see if I could start HRT. But I got to the front desk, and it came up that I have Medicaid. The lady at the desk asked if it was my primary or secondary insurance. I was unsure at the time. She said that if it was my primary insurance, I'd have to pay the full price. I said that I was pretty sure it was my secondary insurance, as my psychiatrist took it as my secondary insurance. She then said that the doctor could not see me AT ALL. Why? Because I have Medicaid. It's not my primary insurance, and my primary insurance that doctor took. But nope. They wouldn't see me AT. ALL. because I have Medicaid. So I leave the doctor's office, practically in tears, because that was the day I was supposed to get ready to FINALLY start HRT. It was going to be great. I was going to finally, FINALLY be closer to myself. So my roommate, who had taken me to the appointment (and was also angry. She's looking for a new doctor after that), took me to her office at work because she didn't trust me to be alone in my upset state (I have a history of self-harm and suicidal tendencies. I don't self-harm anymore, but I had strongly expressed wanting to die, so she didn't trust me alone.) Once we got there, she said to turn my anger into something productive. So I did, and I called my Medicaid advisor and asked for some numbers of endocrinologists who take Medicaid. A few minutes later, he sent me five numbers to call. Now, I have a specific branch of Medicaid called Amerigroup. So we had to find endocrinologists who take that specific type of Medicaid. Supposedly, all of these did. However, two of them WERE endocrinologists, but they didn't prescribe HRT. The other three refused to see me because I'm over eighteen, and they only saw children under the age of eighteen. So I told my advisor, and he got me four more numbers. And apparently, not one of these doctors took Amerigroup. They took Medicaid, but not Amerigroup. So that's nine numbers I'd called, and none of them worked out. So my roommate and I started calling numbers we found online. I found a number that didn't take medicaid, but did take my primary insurance. So I gave her my insurance information, and she said the insurance wouldn't pay for the appointment because I had high deductibles, and I'd have to pay for the entire appointment. That was two hundred dollars. I don't have the money for that!!!!!! So then my roommate and I started calling only numbers that took Medicaid. But none of them took Amerigroup. Two and a half hours and nineteen doctors later, and still no luck. So my roommate and I went to the Resource Center, hoping they could give us something. The lady at the front desk was on her computer for a little while, and gave me a few numbers to call. And a half hour and three doctors later, still nothing. So I was calling doctors for a total of three hours, and I called twenty two doctors, and I still don't have a doctor. I was SO upset. I still am. Yesterday was supposed to be the day I started getting ready to start HRT. I was going to get my blood drawn, and I'd be on my way to starting hormones. But instead, it turned into the worst day of my life. It was awful and I'm so angry. It was so bad that my Medicaid advisor started an entire case about it because he has NEVER seen anything like this, and it was upsetting to him, too. He tried so hard to help me, but none of the doctors would see me, or didn't take my insurance. It's so messed up that someone can call twenty two doctors and be on the phone for three hours and still not have a doctor because none of them take their insurance.

We can't afford therapy (and he's family, so he isn't charging us.), and due to past experiences, my parents are terrified of discontinuing my therapy sessions. Which is a good thing, because my mom was hesitant prior. I think I'm comfortable sharing everything with him except for dysphoria (and my experiences with weed, haha).

Which is important because I'd like to know what my next steps should be with my transition. I *could* order androgel off Amazon but I doubt that's safe. I could subscribe to Pride Counseling but I'm self employed with inconsistent pay, still pushing my resume onto applications. 

He's known and loved me since I was born, and vice versa. I am terrified of him looking at me differently. Unless ""differently"" is defined as neither a man or a woman, and not an attention seeker, just the same young adult he's been treating for the past year. Because that is exactly what I want. Lol. 

Am I being impatient or impulsive? Because, honestly, I *could* wait till I can afford gender therapy for myself, and then come out to *that* therapist instead. But if I come out to my uncle/current therapist, I could get the support and guidance I need sooner, *and* for free. But the possibility of it all backfiring is there, too, so ? Lmao. 

My mother (bless her heart. I love her and she means well but this was *very* unhealthy) paid for behavioral therapy after I cut my hair (without permission-- I was 14, it was 2AM one morning, I looked in the mirror, and then I said ""Fuck this shit"") and came out. But only so that I could ""be fixed"" as she put it. My uncle has my confidentiality-- and I'm 18-- so that won't happen again. That and he isn't anything-gay-phobic. 

But it's been peaceful between the rest of my family and I, only because I'm closeted and hide my gender affirming paraphenelia. When I was 14 and out, Hell rose. Which is why I went back into the closet. I said that I'd do everything I needed when I am 18 and/or older/ASAP. Now I'm 18. Not self sufficient. Just 18 and legally able to make responsible decisions for myself and those who will be effected. 

I told him I bought my first binder and he asked, ""You're not comfortable with your breasts?"" When I said no he smiled and leaned back. ""Interesting. Okay, my dear!"" And then it was time for me to go. A while ago, I was explaining how I like to present myself for whatever reaaon, but didn't want to straight up say ""androgynous,"" because I was afraid of his reaction. So I said ""I like to dress... Like... Like...""

He finished my sentence with: ""Androgunous?""

""Yes!""

""I already knew that."" He smiled. ""I can see it in you; which likely would explain a lot of your behavior."" 

Like. Is that an older therapist's way of saying that you're setting off their gaydar?  Lol

I don't want to say anything to make my therapist/uncle (who probably doesn't know what non binary is) think I'm delusional.

I liked the name greatly but still felt a little discomfort with it, just enough for me to want to change it. my name was picked-on a decent amount. I found out the flipping and switching of the letters, and doing my usual thing, told everyone. I had large groups of people that would call me NEMO. I like it at first, but grew old real quick. also, my bestfriends thought it would be funny if they called themselves owen, so walking into a room with 4-6 people all calling themselves by your name, and following you was traumatic for me. (actually still makes me a little tight in the chest).

before I even knew what being non-binary was I started looking at other names, when I was 11-12 and again when I was 14, and again at 16 a little while ago. The name I landed on every time was Alis.

 Alis is what I have recently started going by. but it has started to feel,,, not as comfortable. I don't know if it's just me kinda settling into the thought of that now being my name. I didn't tell just a small group to try it out, I told EVERYONE. it's been easier for some people than others, but to now not know if it is right for me is frightening. I like the name and it suits me well, but I think it might be too feminine. I have another name that I like, but the that thought comes along of 'what if I don't like the next name, or the next'. I don't want to put anyone through anymore than needs to be done. 

something I noticed while writing this is I am very comfortable with the name Alis, and not at other times. The other name I thought of not too long ago is Sila. (yes, that's Alis backwards). it's gender neutral, uncommon, rolls well, comfortable most of the time, I like the spelling. although I think I might like it more as a nickname than my actual name, something that I can be called, but not always. 

I don't know, am I overthinking, I'm known for doing that. anyways, have a great day, bye

13,2019-08-13 19:40:42,cpy83y,11,13,"(Copying from my post in /nonbinary - keen to hear from people...)

Hello everyone.

For the entirety of my 29 years I've been Cishet, AMAB, Masuline-presenting. A combination of recent incidents has given me to thinking about my gender identity: 

* Meeting my partner (Cis, Bi, also 29) has in general helped me become a more open-minded and curious person, about myself as well as others. We've been together for two + 1/2 years and the way we make supportive, sensitive discussion a frequent staple of our relationship has really helped.
* I work at a coffee shop and frequently have parents/children referring to me as ""The Man"" (i.e. ""Don't grab that cookie, let the man put it on a plate for you""). I know they're not doing anything maliciously, and especially that I present as masculine, but it still makes me uncomfortable. Something in me says that term doesn't specifically apply to me.
* A frequent customer of ours is a trans\*, male-pronouns teenager, with his mother and grandmother; they run a business together and are the loveliest, and the mum and grandma are very vocally supportive of him. This supportive atmosphere, especially at a vulnerable age, does make me wonder about what I missed growing up.
* With birthdays coming up over this month, I've been thinking more about my estranged family and their role in my development, particularly my (emotionally abusive) parents. Although my parents espoused centre-left politics, they always had a more conservative relationship with gender, trying to push me towards more masculine-associated behaviours and interests and discourage femininity. For example, I was often pushed to try to become more involved in sports, which I find boring; and frequently mocked for anything I wore that might be more ""girly"", not to mention my slender, wide-hipped body-shape. 

After some research, I've found that I most identify with being non-binary/a Demiguy. Many aspects of the traditionally ""masculine"" don't seem to fit with me, and I find myself curious if not excited about exploring my femininity. The other day I tried on a dress for the first time, in private; I immediately got this sense of quiet, yet explosive joy. It felt like I'd been colouring in various shades of red and blue my whole life and only just discovered yellow mixes. I wondered about styling my hair, trying makeup or nail polish.

So I guess I'm spilling onto here (and thank you for reading this far!) because I wonder where I go from here. My co-workers are only so tolerant and probably wouldn't understand my expressing this stuff at work; my ever-supportive partner has suggested I could warm up to looking and acting more feminine within the protective space of our home before trying it in the open world.

Not to mention, I am aware of the LGBTQ+ community out there, and especially that as a Cishet, I have it considerably easier than so many others. I never want anyone else to feel I'm intruding on their space, nor acting as though what I've been through compares to what they go through every day.

*Hello,  I am AFAB NB and currently in the process of transitioning. I am  wondering if it's bad to go back on the name you thought you wanted? I  started testing a new name to see if it fit me. It was a gender neutral  nick name from my childhood which I thought would work because a lot of  trans influencers seem to pick symbolic names like that.

Whenever people call me  the name I am trying out with some friends I get bummed out too!*

*I  have started just having people call me by my last name in anonymous  situations like at coffee shops and it is like lifeblood to be referred  to as because I have one of those weird last names that is also a name  (masculine). It feels really good to be called it. I am worried the same  thing will happen with my last name though because lol it's my dad's  name and I was the only one who had his name in my family and he was  really abusive. So it's kind of weird in that it's an identifier for me  but it feels good, but I am worried it won't down the road....*

I know *how* to explain it, the fear is the problem when it comes to basically anyone older than 30. 

I also just can’t be the one to start the conversation. I will only answer questions. With anyone, even people my age, even with people who are trans or non binary themselves. I just don’t feel comfortable talking about it, which is weird because I really, really want too. 

I don’t know if this is shame, fear, or a lack of confidence. 

Anyone have tips for getting over this fear of talking about trans and non binary things.

46,2019-08-25 05:16:50,cv4jre,10,10,"I'm a 30F and have basically mainly 'male' interests although my personality is what I would call 'feminine'. Like, I pretty much only care to work on cars or computers (in anyway, all I really care to talk about, etc), but I tend to be receptive to how people are feeling or I'm a willing ear to listen to how they are (and enjoy it), which is commonly associated to being 'more' feminine (stereotypically, not 'reality' feminine).

For the longest time I thought this meant I was 'androgynous' because I also wore unisex clothes (for the most part, men's shirts and women's jeans, etc, or clothes that explicitly said they were unisex - my all-time go-to), and if anyone messed up and called me 'sir', I would never care (my pronouns are she or them), but with how ""non-binary"" is coming to mainstream (more accessible), I wonder if the correct term for me is actually non-binary even though I certainly look like an androgynous (assuming this is the older term for someone like me) person (still feminine, as I've been told it's obvious I'm a woman even when I'm as unisex as possible) with masculine interests or hobbies.

However, there's a part of me that also feels agender and wants to use the NB label as I'm very drawn towards andro stuff and masculine stuff when watered down with at least a bit of femme.

52,2019-08-27 14:16:53,cw52n7,8,3,"Hey there! First of all, I want to apologize for the long post ahead. I really need to vent about this, and I don't know where else to talk about this other than here. For context, I was born with a female body, and I identify as non binary. I suffer from dysphoria, especially when it comes to my height, voice and chest. I'd dream of going on T or undergoing top surgery, but considering that I'm still mostly in the closet and that my parents are not the most progressive people in the world, I don't think I can ever do those things. To mitigate my dysphoria, I'd often change into a binder when I'm out of the house and change back into a normal sports bra so that my parents don't question anything.  


So to the topic at hand, I have a friend. Firstly, he's not a bad person. In fact, I really treasure our friendship! He's very caring and open minded, and as far as I'm concerned, he's not enbyphobic. In fact, he's part of the LGBT community and is one of the most progressive people I know. (The country I live in isn't the most progressive. In fact, gay sex is actually illegal here.) I came out to some of my friends as non binary, but I never did explicitly tell them to use they/them pronouns on me, so everyone still uses she/her pronouns on me. Though it makes me a little uncomfortable, I'm fine with it, since they don't make a big deal about it.   


This friend of mine does a lot of things that irk me a little bit, one of which is making jokes that go way too far, but I'll focus on the non binary jokes that he makes. I do talk to him about my dysphoria a little bit, and he knows that I want to present in a more masculine manner. The jokes that he makes, not just the one about my non binary identity, have been piling up in my head over the past year, and I really want him to stop. He's not a bad person, but sometimes, he can be quite insensitive.  


His jokes would often include him going out of his way to misgender me. Using she/her pronouns on me, that's fine. But he knows that I dislike being called female terms. Despite this, he still calls me 'lady' in a very joking tone. I'm not talking about the word 'lady' being casually dropped in sentences. I'm talking about him saying ""Lady."" in that tone. Not the worst, of course. One other joke that he makes often is about my chest. I have C cups, and they make me extremely uncomfortable. He knows that, and I often wear my binder around him. Yet, he goes out of his way to say, ""You have big, beautiful boobies!"" and other things to poke fun at my chest. It makes me very uncomfortable and insecure. These are just a few jokes that he makes, and he does make a lot more jokes that don't revolve around my identity but still make me very uncomfortable. I told him about my past of being molested a lot as a child, and he made jokes about that.   


I've endured it all for so long. Sure, not the worst, and I know that he has no ill intentions, but still. Today, he said something that he has said quite a few times, but today, it hit hard. My dysphoria has been worsening a while now, and I didn't tell him this, so I sorta justify what he said in my head. I don't remember the conversation leading up to what he said, but he said, and I quote, **""You'll never be a real boy.""** That struck deep. I'm non binary, yes, but I've tried as hard as I could to present myself more as a male, which is hard when you're in the closet and your parents want you to be a stereotypical girl. Hell, these jokes make me regret coming out to my friends. He's not a bad friend, yes, I know, but the jokes he make? Absolutely abhorrent. Okay maybe not abhorrent. Bad. Yeah.  


I want to tell him to stop, but hey, I tried doing it once when he joked about a situation I was in, and he refused. He stopped eventually when I got out of the situation and stopped talking about it. Also, part of me feels like I should just keep enduring it, and not be a 'fragile special snowflake' who's too sensitive to take a few jokes. What should I do, y'all? Also, if you made it this far, thank you for reading! ;; This is my first time on the subreddit.

I went to a Christian school (very normal in the UK btw, it’s not catholic school or anything evangelical, our village schools are just connected to the village church) and we acted out some story from the bible with one of the saints who has the same name as my dad. The teacher wanted me to play the saint because he has my dad’s name and I was hysterically screaming and crying because I didn’t want people to think I was a boy.

Another part of me hated it because I wanted to be a ‘tomboy’ but I was worried people would think I was ‘fat’ (I know I know, but I was 14) if I dressed that way with my curves, so I always dressed in ways that showed off my body. As I grew up I frequently had the urge to dress in suits and loved dapper styles but I ALWAYS ignored it because I thought I would look fat and was horrified by the idea. 

I’ve always felt this intense fear of being taken for masculine, and I don’t know what it’s about. Personality wise I’m not feminine at all. I dress that part but I definitely see it as a mask. 

Another thing is that I often imagine myself as a man with a dick having sex with a woman. Dunno what that’s about?

8,2019-08-01 19:29:57,ckt2og,6,48,"This is gonna be a long one so strap in. TLDR at the end so don't stress. And thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.

So I guess I'll start at the beginning since that usually seems to work best with these things.

I grew up in a typical white, conservative, middle class, Catholic home in SoCal. Despite having a very metered upbringing, even at an early age I began to identify certain feelings in myself in regards to gender and sexuality. For most of my childhood, I had a very sheltered and comfortable life. Looking back, it's almost miraculous how little interaction I got with the world outside of my immediate bubble. Unsurprisingly I never really developed a healthy vocabulary regarding anything to do with understanding one's own identity. It's ironic that when you have SO much privilege that you almost automatically become like something spat out of a factory. But I digress.

Fast forward to highschool, my father needed to relocate work and so we would be moving to Seattle. After moving and becoming somewhat settled, I realized quickly that moving to Seattle had been the single most important and beneficial life change I'd experienced up until this point. Later on I learned this was even more important than I initially realized. Being exposed to much more open, liberal, and diverse environment than I was raised in had a profound impact on how I viewed many things, particularly in myself. (And that really says something, because many people view Seattle as a pretty whitewashed city, but compared to my home town it might as well have been Mexico City).

While I lived in Seattle I met my now married partner, at the time an equally cishet Catholic girl, but now 6.5 years later is firmly trans agender New Yorker, currently prepping for top surgery. Over these few short years, we've been to hell and back together, and along the way we've had an incredible journey of self reflection and discovery. We discovered and came out together as pan and have explored/confirmed these feelings and emotions. Along with this of course, I have been side by side with them as they came to the realization they were agender. 

For many years, my partner struggled with (and still does in some capacity) a long list of mental health issues, ranging from crippling depression to bipolarism to schizophrenic outbursts. We worked through these ailments, and after finding treatment that works for them, they have been able to approach living something like a normal life. It brings me so much joy to have seen them grow in this way.

Soon after my partner began medication, the paramount feelings of body+gender dysphoria and dyspmorphia that had been previously buried by their former mental state began to surface. We've managed to work through this challenge as well, but of course everything is a work in progress. Needless to say, while I'll never truly know what it's like, I have seen first hand the very real pain and suffering a trans person goes through when dyspmorphia and dysphoria strike. I have, and will always be, in full support of my partner and their transition as well as every day after.

During my partner's journey of identification, I have been able to become much more educated myself. I've been read and researching on various topics so I can be a more helpful, more compassionate person with regards to gender identity, pronouns, etc. One of the books that sticks out is Gender Outlaws by Kate Bornstein and S. Bear Bergman. A great quick read if you haven't heard of it.

For most of my life, I've been able to pretty confidently say that I'm a male and happy as one. To date I have never experienced dysphoria in any way, and have never felt disconnected from my gender. In the past few months however, I've been making a lot of changes to my appearance and have taken on a much more feminine/androgynous profile. My hair is now the longest it has ever been in my entire life, I look for opportunities to use makeup, etc. My partner and I wear a shared wardrobe because we're basically the same size, and although it leans masc, I often tend to be drifting towards more feminine options. This is all very randomized from day to day as one might expect.

All of these changes I've been making were never conscious shifts towards a more fem appearance, but were simply things I wanted to try out of curiosity and found this, that, and the other thing just looked good on me as a result. I am very indifferent to pronouns for myself, but over time I've been increasingly identified as female by strangers and it feels really good when that happens. More and more, I want to continue this trend more proactively. This often makes my partner playfully annoyed because often I will accidentally end up looking more non-binary than they do. :P

So now we're here, and I'm questioning if I am not as strictly male as I thought I was. I've been struggling with this a little bit because as mentioned, I am very familiar with what real dysphoria looks like, and I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is valid or if I'm just along for the ride and THINK this is how I'm super feel. 

Nonetheless, my partner suggested a new name that immediately felt right and that has been a big turning point for me in how I view my own gender identity. If you have any thoughts about my story or any resources that might be useful, I'd love to hear about them.

And thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.\n\nSo I guess I'll start at the beginning since that usually seems to work best with these things.\n\nI grew up in a typical white, conservative, middle class, Catholic home in SoCal. Despite having a very metered upbringing, even at an early age I began to identify certain feelings in myself in regards to gender and sexuality. For most of my childhood, I had a very sheltered and comfortable life. Looking back, it's almost miraculous how little interaction I got with the world outside of my immediate bubble. Unsurprisingly I never really developed a healthy vocabulary regarding anything to do with understanding one's own identity. It's ironic that when you have SO much privilege that you almost automatically become like something spat out of a factory. But I digress.\n\nFast forward to highschool, my father needed to relocate work and so we would be moving to Seattle. After moving and becoming somewhat settled, I realized quickly that moving to Seattle had been the single most important and beneficial life change I'd experienced up until this point. Later on I learned this was even more important than I initially realized. Being exposed to much more open, liberal, and diverse environment than I was raised in had a profound impact on how I viewed many things, particularly in myself. (And that really says something, because many people view Seattle as a pretty whitewashed city, but compared to my home town it might as well have been Mexico City).\n\nWhile I lived in Seattle I met my now married partner, at the time an equally cishet Catholic girl, but now 6.5 years later is firmly trans agender New Yorker, currently prepping for top surgery. Over these few short years, we've been to hell and back together, and along the way we've had an incredible journey of self reflection and discovery. We discovered and came out together as pan and have explored/confirmed these feelings and emotions. Along with this of course, I have been side by side with them as they came to the realization they were agender. \n\nFor many years, my partner struggled with (and still does in some capacity) a long list of mental health issues, ranging from crippling depression to bipolarism to schizophrenic outbursts. We worked through these ailments, and after finding treatment that works for them, they have been able to approach living something like a normal life. It brings me so much joy to have seen them grow in this way.\n\nSoon after my partner began medication, the paramount feelings of body+gender dysphoria and dyspmorphia that had been previously buried by their former mental state began to surface. We've managed to work through this challenge as well, but of course everything is a work in progress. Needless to say, while I'll never truly know what it's like, I have seen first hand the very real pain and suffering a trans person goes through when dyspmorphia and dysphoria strike. I have, and will always be, in full support of my partner and their transition as well as every day after.\n\nDuring my partner's journey of identification, I have been able to become much more educated myself. I've been read and researching on various topics so I can be a more helpful, more compassionate person with regards to gender identity, pronouns, etc. One of the books that sticks out is Gender Outlaws by Kate Bornstein and S. Bear Bergman. A great quick read if you haven't heard of it.\n\nFor most of my life, I've been able to pretty confidently say that I'm a male and happy as one. To date I have never experienced dysphoria in any way, and have never felt disconnected from my gender. In the past few months however, I've been making a lot of changes to my appearance and have taken on a much more feminine/androgynous profile. My hair is now the longest it has ever been in my entire life, I look for opportunities to use makeup, etc. My partner and I wear a shared wardrobe because we're basically the same size, and although it leans masc, I often tend to be drifting towards more feminine options. This is all very randomized from day to day as one might expect.\n\nAll of these changes I've been making were never conscious shifts towards a more fem appearance, but were simply things I wanted to try out of curiosity and found this, that, and the other thing just looked good on me as a result. I am very indifferent to pronouns for myself, but over time I've been increasingly identified as female by strangers and it feels really good when that happens. More and more, I want to continue this trend more proactively. This often makes my partner playfully annoyed because often I will accidentally end up looking more non-binary than they do. :P\n\nSo now we're here, and I'm questioning if I am not as strictly male as I thought I was. I've been struggling with this a little bit because as mentioned, I am very familiar with what real dysphoria looks like, and I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is valid or if I'm just along for the ride and THINK this is how I'm super feel. \n\nNonetheless, my partner suggested a new name that immediately felt right and that has been a big turning point for me in how I view my own gender identity. If you have any thoughts about my story or any resources that might be useful, I'd love to hear about them.\n\n\n\nTLDR; I've been pretty confident about being male up to this point, but now after a thorough gender and sexuality education and journey, I'm not sure where I fall or if what I'm feeling is valid."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Conquered Sexuality, Now Questioning', 'created': 1564712997.0}"

Pride festival is on in my local city and I went along to a get-together for a trans and genderqueer social event. Was really excited and nervous because I know nobody in my local community so I was going alone. Now apart from wearing a pride T-shirt, feminine looking jeans, and pink shoes, I was otherwise completely masc presenting, short hair, clean shaven, no makeup.

When I went to order myself a coffee the barista looked confused and said are you with the group? I said yes and she clarified “this is a *transgender* group” (emphasis hers) and again I said yes I’m with the group. Anyway she wasn’t convinced but I got myself a coffee.

I’m transmasculine/non-binary, and after a lot of debating, I decided to keep my first name (a very common girls’ name) and to legally change my middle name to something neutral or male. Part of that’s because I still kind of like my first name, and part of it is because I’m not out to everyone, including most of my family. Anyway, I figured that when I moved somewhere new for a job or school, I would go by that new middle name to make sure people perceived me properly. Simple, right?

So I’m still in the process of changing the name, but that will be done soon. (It’s a guys’ name, just not one that sounds super masculine.) And now that I’m moving somewhere new—I won’t say whether it’s for a job or school since that’s personal info—I notified the necessary people that I’m trans and want to go by my pending middle name. And the response was positive and supportive! Which is great, right? At last, I’ll have my preferred name and pronouns.

Except it’s NOT.

Seriously, I don’t know. (I probably need a therapist, but I don’t think I can afford one at the moment, lol.) I think part of it is impostor (imposter?) syndrome—like, I feel like I’m not legit or something, and so I think I don’t have a right to do all this.

And I guess I’m nervous about passing, too. Plus, I’m going by my first name other places (like my apartment), so it’s...weirdly inconsistent.\n\nBut it’s more than that, and I don’t get it. I just know that I get anxious every time I get an email addressed to my preferred name. I’m fine thinking of myself as the new name, but as soon as someone else uses it, I feel like I’ve done something wrong. It’s just...I don’t know. Does that make sense?

Some Background info: I'm 22 years old, non binary, and go by they them pronouns. I'm out with my identity and pronouns to close friends as well as my partner but that's pretty much it. I've only mentioned the possibility of changing my name to a few trusted people briefly. Only my partner knows what my new name is. 

I've had a name in mind for years that I've always envisioned myself using when I am ""more out"" about being non binary. I pictured myself being brave and taking on this new name as soon as I ""come out more"" by telling my family about my identity and being ""more out"" in college. I didn't want to change my name in the past when I was halfway through university and face any potential push back from my classmates and profs. So I figured I should wait until college to enact this change when I'll be meeting a bunch of new people, instead of facing this giant hurdle when my peers have already known me by another name for years. I also always told myself that I would come out to my parents the summer before entering college.

This has been the plan for years and now its coming up in a few weeks, and I'm terrified. 

I don't know if its because of these nervous feelings or something else but I'm second guessing whether my ""new name"" really fits. I'm doubting myself, the new name doesn't feel like me the same way my current name doesn't feel like me. But it's not like there's a more recent different name that's attracting me now, it's just that nothing feels like ""me"". Suddenly I'm doubting a lot of what I though would be certain about my future and how I come out and how i get myself finally be ""me"".

I'm worried that I'm taking too big a step in such a short period of time by changing my name very publicly. I'm worried that I'll quickly realize that this new name isn't for me and I'll have to go through some sort of backlash by changing my name again. 

I'm not sure if anyone else felt this way while coming out or has any advice. I just haven't had much luck in finding others who may have felt this way and how they coped.

I'm 18 and born female. I started questioning my gender and sexuality at 16 or 17, and have ever since been in an growing state of confusion. The last half-year my mind has been in quite a chaotic state and am constantly asking the same questions over and over, in different ways.

At first, I though I was FtM trans, but the more time passed the more confusing it became and I am now in the state of considering other labels as options. And yes, I know I don't HAVE to label myself but I would feel a lot more at ease finding a befitting one, as many others do. 

I feel as if though there are many that fit me well, such as bigender, genderqueer, gender fluid, non-binary/androgynous or gender non-conforming. But I'm having a very hard time deciding. It would be really helpful if you could give your own experience as any of the above mentioned genders, and explaining the more accurate meaning of each title and their differences. 

More about me. Growing up, I was raised as a girl normally, and It never really bothered me. I remember liking playing with dolls a lot and I loved disney princess movies. I also liked hotwheels, and loved to see my brother play and show off his cool looking cars. I've always had a feminine and masculine side to me, and they played together very well in my childhood. 

As I started questioning myself recently, they have not been nearly as in synch as before and I feel a need to separate them from each other. My more masculine side I feel like has been neglected as I started maturing both in body and mind, I was now a ""girl"" instead of a child. I had no outlets for my masculine interest anymore. Of course I also got dysphoria and morhpia, I wore sports bras most of my highschool and when I finally did use some bras, it never really felt quite right. I still dislike bras.

It then occurred to me that historically, ""queer"" meant ""weird.""

I used to be skeptical about the whole ""non-binary"" identity. Ironically, that's because I related too much to what they were saying. Oh, you're not comfortable performing your gender? Who is? What's that? You don't fully identify as a male or female? Well, we're all just genderless psyches that inhabit gendered bodies, because that's how I see myself and I can't imagine anyone having a different mind than me!

I also had moments in my life where I was super rebellious to my own assigned gender identity. Pirates of the Caribbean came out the summer before I went to college for the first time. I was obsessed with Captain Jack Sparrow's eyeliner and decided to wear some myself. I also decided to start wearing nail polish, even though the character did not. That was also the year I wore full on drag  to go to a Rocky Horror Picture Show. I had a friend give me a cool Indie chick makeover and I loved how I looked and felt. Made sure I shaved my legs. Yes, this all seems superficial and hyper-focused on fashion, but it led me to declaring in the laundry room of my dorm, ""I hereby denounce my masculinity!""

A friend of the family looked concerned that I was dolling myself up and asked, ""Are you a switch-it-er-upper?"" 

""A what?""

""Do you like boys and girls?""

""Oh, no,"" I said. ""But I'm like boys and girls?""

Had I continued down this path, maybe I would have settled into a long-lasting genderqueer identity. Instead, I cissed myself up and got a long term girlfriend.

It wasn't until recently that my desire to femme out revealed itself again.

Of course, this was also preceded by years of feeling like kind of an impostor in groups of guys - I couldn't put my finger on it, but I always felt in such a masculine crowd they would sniff me out and find out I didn't belong. I worked on a construction site last year... it was Hell. Again, I can't explain why, but I just didn't feel I belonged. That being said, people of all shades of masculine or feminine belong anywhere they damn please - I am aware of that.

So... I've been dressing as a woman at home. Thought it was a new gender identity thing, then a kink, and now I'm leaning into feelings of slight gender dysphoria. But I can't seem to trust my own thoughts. I think, ""Oh, you're an impostor! You're not trans enough to identify as anything!""

Actually, I start worrying about which group I'm culturally appropriating from: cis women or trans women? All women? Am I a dirty ""transtrender?""

It's just cross-dressing, but why is it so important that I feel like going out in public at some point? There are some local gay bars I might just want to visit all femmed out, but I'm afraid people will find me tacky and mocking other people's identities.

But I really want to interact with people who see me and recognize my femininity.

Pirates of the Caribbean came out the summer before I went to college for the first time. I was obsessed with Captain Jack Sparrow\'s eyeliner and decided to wear some myself. I also decided to start wearing nail polish, even though the character did not. That was also the year I wore full on drag  to go to a Rocky Horror Picture Show. I had a friend give me a cool Indie chick makeover and I loved how I looked and felt. Made sure I shaved my legs. Yes, this all seems superficial and hyper-focused on fashion, but it led me to declaring in the laundry room of my dorm, ""I hereby denounce my masculinity!""\n\nA friend of the family looked concerned that I was dolling myself up and asked, ""Are you a switch-it-er-upper?"" \n\n""A what?""\n\n""Do you like boys and girls?""\n\n""Oh, no,"" I said. ""But I\'m like boys and girls?""\n\nHad I continued down this path, maybe I would have settled into a long-lasting genderqueer identity. Instead, I cissed myself up and got a long term girlfriend.\n\nIt wasn\'t until recently that my desire to femme out revealed itself again.\n\nOf course, this was also preceded by years of feeling like kind of an impostor in groups of guys - I couldn\'t put my finger on it, but I always felt in such a masculine crowd they would sniff me out and find out I didn\'t belong. I worked on a construction site last year... it was Hell. Again, I can\'t explain why, but I just didn\'t feel I belonged. That being said, people of all shades of masculine or feminine belong anywhere they damn please - I am aware of that.\n\nSo... I\'ve been dressing as a woman at home. Thought it was a new gender identity thing, then a kink, and now I\'m leaning into feelings of slight gender dysphoria. But I can\'t seem to trust my own thoughts. I think, ""Oh, you\'re an impostor! You\'re not trans enough to identify as anything!""\n\nActually, I start worrying about which group I\'m culturally appropriating from: cis women or trans women? All women? Am I a dirty ""transtrender?""\n\nIt\'s just cross-dressing, but why is it so important that I feel like going out in public at some point? There are some local gay bars I might just want to visit all femmed out, but I\'m afraid people will find me tacky and mocking other people\'s identities.\n\nBut I really want to interact with people who see me and recognize my femininity.\n\ntldr: I want to live my genderqueer life, but I\'m afraid I\'m not genderqueer enough to deserve to.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Being Genderqueer with Liberal Guilt', 'created': 1565166726.0}"

55,2019-08-08 08:11:37,cnintb,38,106,"First, I would just like to say that this is not meant to offend anyone who is genderfluid and amab. This is just a bit of a rant about things I’ve experienced lately.

As an afab genderfluid/nonbinary person, i feel there is a distinct stigma around being afab and genderfluid. I’ve heard multiple times from different people ranging from complete strangers that i’ve just met to close friends that, “LGBT is so trendy now, every teenager is gay or trans. You’re going through a phase.” Or, “Are you sure your not just a tomboy? I mean look at [insert any other female that dresses androgynously here], she dresses like a boy and SHE doesnt have a label or special pronoun.” And even sometimes, “She wears hoodies and pants and says she’s “gEnDeRfLuId” to be a special snowflake. Its all for attention. I’ve seen her wear makeup and watch romance anime, so she’s not really trans.” 

Lately I’ve been really jealous of my amab friends because of this. It seems people are much more likely to accept that you’re genderfluid and not just a tomboy or doing it for attention if you’re born a male who enjoys feminine things. I still like feminine things. I just like masculine things too, and I dont feel feminine in the slightest. It feels like everything would be so much better if I was born a male that likes makeup and romances. My physical attributes would look the way I want them to look, people wouldnt invalidate me as often, and I could express myself the way i truly want to. I notice I’ve been trying to overcompensate my masculine side and have been feeling more dysphoric than ever. Maybe I played with dolls and wore dresses when I was 5.

This is literally my first post to reddit ever, but I'm hoping I can find someone who can relate.  I was assigned female at birth and have identified strongly as being a lesbian since I was in high school. I've also known for sure I want a hysterectomy for about the same length of time.  I've always had debilitating cramps, and on top of that my pms depression has gotten worse and worse since entering the realm of adulthood.  I'm 23 now and I spend almost an entire week out of every month being completely unable to control my emotions, sobbing nonstop at anything and everything, and snapping at people I really care about and don't want to hurt. On top of all that, thanks to a now almost 3 year long struggle with chronic yeast infections (that have only responded to treatment with boric acid capsules and those are irritating as hell), I have lost all desire to continue to have a vagina.  

As you might guess, thanks to all that I don't exactly have a roaring sex life.  I'm very fortunate that my girlfriend (who I've been with for almost 4 years) has been incredibly understanding of all of my physical ailments, but we both wish that the sexual component of our relationship was stronger.  I'm a stone top, and I really enjoy eating her out, but even that's difficult for me to do without a lot of neck pain thanks to a rare condition I have where the bottom part of my brain pokes down into my spinal column.  

All that being said, I recently decided to pursue getting a total hysterectomy and vaginectomy through a local trans clinic that works on the informed consent model.  I have my first appointment on Thursday.  I'm super excited, but I'm also worried that I'll be met with resistance or confusion because I don't exactly intend to stop identifying as a woman.  I know I'm not a ciswoman™ but I still feel a connection to womanhood, and in a practical social sense I know for sure that I am never going to feel more comfortable in the men's locker room than I do in the women's locker room.  I'm fine with id-ing as nonbinary, but as kind of a modifier before woman. Pretty much all my dysphoria stems from things that are medical problems but no cis OBGYN is willing to give me the fix I want for them because to them it's too drastic.  I've also been a bit discouraged/frustrated because all the surgical transition resources I've found for afab non-binary folks are focused on top surgery or like, getting meta but keeping the vagina.  I can't find anyone else who just wants a vaginectomy.  I'm starting to feel like a gender alien.

I have become more and more masculine over the past few years after dropping out of fashion school and spending a very long time deconstructing my dependency to makeup.  Now I pretty much only wear makeup for events, and I only do experimental/editorial looks that feel more like a form of drag.  I still have a lot of fun performing femininity for performance art's sake, but on a normal day I feel better when I feel more butch.  Even though my performance of gender is often more masculine, I don't see embracing masculinity being the same as embracing maleness, and at the end of the day I really just feel like a very confused dyke with a really weird set of health problems.  I don't exactly feel like I'm transitioning to another gender, I just want to be able to live in a body where I don't have an adversarial relationship to my own genitals.  I feel like pursuing these surgeries will help me feel more confident and comfortable in my own body, especially sexually and I feel like that counts as treating dysphoria.

80,2019-08-11 09:42:35,couvcw,4,9,"I want to apologize in advance for this complicated mess of a post.

I’m 23 and AMAB, and I’ve been been identifying as non-binary for a few months now.  Mainly just in my own head, cause i havent really come out to anyone i know in real life yet, cause i have zero self esteem and i’m terrified what my friends and family will think.  Im also terrified that maybe im not really non-binary and im just faking it to make myself feel better about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think i “feel” male, but i dont necessarily feel female either (although sometimes i think i do).  I feel like my ideal body would be genderless and androgynous, with no reproductive organs.  

&amp;#x200B;

Back in high school, i remember sometimes secretly wanting to be female, but that was only some of the time; a lot of times i wouldnt care that i was male, or at least i didnt really think about it.  I would sometimes feel compelled to find ways to make myself look/feel more feminine, usually in small ways, like wearing womens’ jeans or wearing eyeliner.  I used to try on female clothing in secret sometimes.  I thought my body had a somewhat-feminine shape and was proud of that (really i was just fat, lmao).  I shaved my legs and body hair sometimes.  I tried to teach myself to have really feminine handwriting and secretly hoped that someone would mistake it for a girl’s handwriting...That probably sounds really stupid.  I went through a whole “emo” phase that, in retrospect, was somewhat just an excuse for me to try and make myself look more androgynous.  I sometimes secretly hoped someone would mistake me for a girl, but i also thought that was unrealistic.  

I was going through a bunch of stuff like that back then, but at the time, I kinda just wrote it off as “teenage hormones” and assumed everyone went through stuff like that.  I grew up/went to high school in a small, non-diverse town, do at the time, i didn’t know about non-binary identities, and i hardly knew anything about transgender either.  Im sorry for my bad grammar.  Its really late at night.  

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, in college was the first time i learned about non-binary identities and I immediately felt i identified with that. I experimented with identifying as agender for a while, but decided to drop it because I was experiencing serious self-doubt, and i had this extreme debilitating fear that i was just faking it for attention or something.  All my non-binary friends and classmates seemed so sure and so confident in their identities and they seemed like they had always known they were non-binary, and i felt like an impostor.  I went for the next like, five years after that convinced i was male, identified as male, went by he/him pronouns, etc.  i didnt really question my gender identity during that time, although in my mind, i sometimes considered myself “a genderless spirit in a male body” that felt comfortable identifying as male.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then a few months ago, i was sitting in my friend’s car, zoning out, and i completely randomly had the thought “I’m a woman.” and I felt like i’d had an epiphany.  It was the weirdest feeling and i can’t really describe it.  It was really intense.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, over the next few weeks, i steadily kept thinking about my gender identity more and more until i couldnt stop thinking about it.  I questioned for a couple weeks at first if i was mtf trans, but now i think its more likely that i’m genderfluid, or agender.  I’ve come to the realization that i really kinda hate having an uh... male part, and i wish i could get rid of it, and be completely genderless down there.  I sometimes wish my body was more feminine, but other times i just want to be androgynous.  I’ve realized i don’t necessarily like having a male voice, either

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, im still extremely afraid that maybe im just faking it to feel special or something.  Theres a bunch of stuff that just doesnt add up.  

\-I never really questioned my gender identity at all until around age 15.  

\-When i was a little kid, i mean line ages 3 to like 10, i actually had an extreme fear of being mistaken for a girl and would refuse to any clothes that i perceived as looking “feminine.”  This ended by age 10 or so, and as i said before, around age 15 was when the gender stuff really started for me.  

\-Ive never felt bothered by being referred to by male pronouns, although it equally wouldn’t bother me to be referred to by female pronouns.  I currently (mentally) refer to myself by they/them pronouns, but sometimes i still slip up and refer to myself as he/him

\-I had some weird daydream today about being old and having some boring office job and i was still male

\-sometimes i catch myself thinking about myself as a guy/a man

And a bunch of other stuff like that, probably, that i cant think of right now cause im half asleep and also i dont want to make an annoyingly long post which ive probably already done oops

&amp;#x200B;

Im new here and, honestly, just looking for advice. I’m going to jump right into it, that might be helpful...

I’m 30 years old and was born male. However, for as long as I can remember I’ve always aligned more with female gender norms. I would spend time growing up dressing up when I could and surrounding myself with friends who were girls as a way to be their “cool guy friend” who they could make over and dress up without the judgement of it all. I’ve always been very emotional and nurturing, I’ve valued fashion and glamour over sports and getting dirty. I’d rather watch a romcom (Hey, Meryl, you queen!) over an action flick (unless it has Daniel Craig... you get it). And so, being friends with the girls made all that easier!

Unfortunately, when I was very young my father caught me dressing up. His response was physical abuse and humiliation. Since then I felt like I had to hide my femininity. I kept trying to express myself in private but wasn’t able to ever truly be free. I then joined the military and was surrounded by your traditional “toxic masculinity” culture. I guess over the years I’ve felt the need to suppress who I was so much that I started to think my desire to be a woman was a phase.

Fast forward and over the last year my identity has taken a hit. More than ever before I found myself hating that I was born male and wishing I was a woman. It led me into a pretty deep depression surrounding my male identity and feeling “stuck” as a person I didn’t love. I’m in a hetero marriage (I identify as bi) and recently shared my desire to become more feminine with my partner and came out to her as bi. She has been INCREDIBLY supportive, which was unexpected.

Here’s where I need help. Despite her support I still find instances where I internalize her actions—maybe we plan a “girls night” and she comes up with reasons not to do it, or she subconsciously points me toward male normative behaviors or fashion and it hurts.. This really just drowns me and I feel like I was wrong for being honest and authentic. In my expression I’m not sure where I exist, I’m not sure how to confidently be feminine and not be judged. I think there’s just a weird erasure to it all and it’s made me really desire a community.

I guess I feel like I was super excited to “come out as both bi and gender queer” but I’m struggling with the actual living of it. I truly don’t feel like I fit as a male and wish so desperately feel something real. I’m afraid of losing people close to me, even if they’ve been supportive but I also want to be true to myself.

Much love.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey fam,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing you all because I wanted to share a bit of information about myself with you all. I hope that through this email you may know me a bit better and I may be able to articulate a part of myself I haven’t always been able to. Thank you for taking the time to read this, much love!

Okay so here is the information… I am starting to identify as being genderqueer. What the heck is genderqueer you may be wondering?? Genderqueer basically means gender that exists outside the traditional gender binary (boy/girl). When I say that I am genderqueer I am expressing that I am neither a girl or boy. It is basically a word that means my gender is queer (non-normative).  If you placed me on a spectrum, with ‘masculine’ being at one end and ‘feminine’ being at the other, I’m somewhere in-between, and somewhat always fluctuating.

As a kid I always felt relatively frustrated and often confused about gender and why having female anatomy made me all of a sudden qualified as “girl”. While I didn’t have the language to express it, I was definitely always playing around with my gender expression and either secretly (or publicly) rolling my eyes at “girly” things.  I want you all to know that I am still the same old \_name\_, just \_name\_ who is starting to see themselves more clearly and with some words that finally feel like they match how I’ve always felt.

I also just wanted to let you know that as of now I don’t have any plans to transition my gender physically (aka no medical or hormonal changes). Coming out as genderqueer, for me, is more about expressing and naming my gender identity. I still exist in a female body, I am just no longer conforming or subscribing to the prescribed gender given to me at birth. 

As I continue to embrace my gender I am starting to ask that people use gender neutral pronouns when talking and thinking about me. Instead of referring to me using she/her pronouns I would prefer that you use they/them pronouns. Example: “Oh there goes \_name\_, they are walking to the grocery store! Oh \_name\_, I love them.” It may seem strange at first, but with a bit of practice using gender neutral pronouns becomes really natural and would mean so much to me! This also extends to words like daughter, sister, aunt, gal, etc. Using gender neutral pronouns sometimes involves a bit of creativity (child, sibling, untie, pal, etc.) but it does wonders in terms of re-framing how people see me through time. :)

I am eager to share this with you all because it feels like an essential and beautiful part to who I am. I hope that this is is not too much information or too overwhelming. I wrote this as a letter to allow you some space to process if you needed it. Feel free to reach out when you feel ready, I am hopeful and excited for this growth season.  

I love you and am so grateful for all the ways you have loved and held me. Thank you for letting me share this part of myself with you. 

ALSO, here are some links to some great articles that I think are SUPER HELPFUL…

So I am 18, born with female anatomy. Since birth, I have always been the more ""masculine"" one in the family. My sister has always been the ""girly"" one and I have always been more of a tomboy (but I wasn't trying or anything). When I was 13 I cut my hair short because I wanted to look a bit more masculine.

105,2019-08-13 20:54:08,cpz9fx,20,43,"I am a 23 year old AFAB. I've always had really bad dysphoria but due to growing up in a very conservative Christian home I never knew what it was and just thought I was uncomfortable because I was ""too fat, too skinny, big forehead, ugly smile, thick thighs, tiny arms"" and yeah you get the point. I always made excuses for it. When I went to college it got worse and I started over femenizing everything on my dysphoric days (which I still didn't know was dysphoria). I just assumed it was because I'm not as pretty as my two sisters and never get along with other girls as friends so I tried to make up for it in making everything I did super feminine. 

Fast forward and I just discovered what dysphoria is. It's been worse since I identified it. My problem arises where some days I feel like I should be a guy and other days I'm not dysphoric at all and enjoy being feminine. My dysphoric days are bad though, to the point where by the end of the day i convince myself that I'm a trans guy, but in a day or two I'm perfectly happy being a female. I've been going with gender fluid, but from what I understand gender fluid is when you sometimes feel more masc and sometimes more fem and some right in the middle, etc. But on my dysphoric days, I feel like I AM a trans male, not just more masculine that day.

I could have this all wrong as again, I grew up in a conservative Christian home and was homeschooled so I never learned any of this or was around anyone who wasn't a conservative Christian. 

Any advice on how to identify and also how to make those dysphoric days better? Anyone know why my dysphoria has gotten significantly worse since I identified it? I also never have bottom dysphoria but have dysphoria about everything else, I'm not sure if that makes a difference.

I have always been open minded when it came to peoples sexuality. Love is love, it really should be that simple. I’m from a small town so the whole concept of non-binary genders is somewhat new around here (short of the traditional perception of what “trans” is). That is to say I grew up, like most folks, not ever really questioning the binary. You were either male or female. Gay or straight. Maybe bi. 

In the last few years, some awesome and progressive minded friends have taught me a lot about gender flexibility, and how we should all stop thinking about gender as it relates to our biology or our sexuality. I’ve since considered myself an avid and outward supporter of genderfluidity, or simply, supportive of the idea that anyone should be able to identify as whatever makes them comfortable in their own skin. And, most importantly, no one should be harassed or bullied for doing so. 

So I’ve “talked the talk,” at least when it came to my social circles. 

Then I met my current partner. Now I want to “walk the walk”

We met at a bar about 3 months ago, and have been dating for the last two. I did not know they were genderqueer until after we started texting after the night we met. It was unexpected but did not dissuade me in the least. Getting used to pronouns was and continues to be a challenge after some 30 years of referring to everyone as he/she, but I feel it has helped me honestly seem them as neither male nor female. Some days they present very feminine and others very masculine. I think they are beautiful always. They have totally turned my world upside down and am so lucky to have found them. 

After all that rambling, I guess my question is, what is my sexuality? I have always considered myself a straight male, and in a way I still feel that I am as I don’t think I’d be sexually attracted to them if they were biologically male. I feel like this might be dismissive of their gender preference, though, because it doesn’t acknowledge their masculinity. 

On the other hand, I feel as though considering myself “bisexual” is appropriation in a way, if that makes sense. It takes away from other folks who consider themselves bisexual. 

Obviously I’ve discussed this at length with them, but we both thought it might be good to get some outside perspective on the matter.

I would like a more masculine name but my female name doesnt bother me. \n\nI think I personally would feel better in a mans body and being a guy, I'm definitely a gay man if that's the case because even when I envision myself as a man, I'm with my husband. I've tried seeing myself with a girl both as a female and as a make, and it does nothing for me.\n\nHow do you know if transitioning is for you?

My gender identity is [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) meaning it's a little of column A and a little of column B (and column C/D/E/etc. for those who don't want to view gender as strictly binary), and the amounts fluctuate often. I am AMAB (assigned male at birth) and have no plans for any sort of gender-affirmation surgery (i.e., [sex reassignment surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery); me and my spouse are perfectly content with my tackle, as it exists.

I prefer lace underwear, which isn't typically designed with the male in mind. There is lace underwear made specifically for men, but I've found it to be low quality and tends to fray and fall apart quickly. So far, I've purchased from [Male Power](https://malepower.com/musthaves/sexy/), [Joe Snyder](https://joe-snyder.us/shop-by-collection/lace), and a couple random online sellers whose products were, upon receiving them and looking closer, just modifying inexpensive female underwear with a pouch for the male package (while it is annoying to find out you paid $20 for a pair of modified Aerie underwear, kudos to the business acumen of the person who's snagging them during their 10/$35 sales, sowing on a pouch, and charging over five times what they paid). The one high-quality pair of male lace underwear I've found is [Hanky Panky's men's original rise thong](https://www.hankypanky.com/men-s-original-rise-thong.html). I wish Hanky Panky offered male options for more of their styles, but that's not currently the case. 
A lot of Hanky Panky's female underwear work for AMAB without [tucking](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3ggjj/how-to-tuck) or using a [gaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaff_(clothing)) (I have zero interest in tucking or using a gaff), but the bit of extra fabic Hanky Panky added to their mens thong does make it substantially more comfortable than the female-designed version of the same thong.

I\'m worried I\'ll be seen as foolish, or trend-hopping, or that they\'ll just dismiss me as a dumb millennial (even though most people there are around my age, I always feel like I\'m somehow seen as ""younger"" and less experienced/respected). I\'d honestly say nothing to them at all, except that I know people would notice physical changes, even slight ones.\n\nI guess what I\'m looking for is reassurance, or hearing other people\'s experiences with ""coming out"" in a workplace, to coworkers they\'ve worked closely with for multiple years.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'hrt/work anxieties', 'created': 1566974541.0}"

Some **gay men** argue that **trans people** do not belong in the same community, insisting that

* trans people are just riding on the coat-tails of successful gay rights activism.
* gender identity is being needlessly confused with issues of sexual orientation.
* inclusion of trans people is holding back back progress for achieving gay rights.
* trans people should remain on the sidelines so that gay leaders can take charge.
* the needs and concerns of trans people are secondary to the cause of gay rights.
* trans people deserve visibility and support, but only upon approval by gay men.
* trans people pose a direct threat to the legitimacy of the gay rights movement.

Many **trans women** argue that **gender nonconforming** people do not belong in the same community, insisting that

* gender nonconforming people are just riding on the coat-tails of successful trans rights activism.
* gender presentation is being needlessly confused with issues of gender identity.
* inclusion of gender nonconforming people is holding back progress for achieving trans rights.

* gender nonconforming people deserve visibility and support, but only upon approval of trans women.

Indeed the sheer number of parallels is frightening, even down to the fact that gay activists will often lend support for trans rights, but only when it's convenient to boost the numbers or to give an illusion of solidarity for sake of publicity.

Story time?

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been pretty comfortable with being a cis gendered female. I grew up surrounded by LGBT friends and allies and went through a lot of soul searching as a teen. From being straight, to lesbian, to bi, just all over the board. My sexuality is something I’ve never been confused about, I just fell into exploring at an early age and knew that I wasn’t straight. 

Fast forward to now, age 25. I’m comfortable enough to say that I am pansexual confidently. 

Recently, I’ve been having these doubts about myself. I’ve never been very feminine, but I was always at peace with who I was. Even now, I’m not physically feeling out of myself. It’s mentally. Mentally, I feel very non binary. And it’s eating away at me a bit because I have no one to talk to about it.

It started with my past relationship with an ftm trans male. With him, I felt like a, for lack of a better term, ‘top.’ I explored with him something I had never explored sexually, and it just felt so right. 

I’ve come to admit to myself what I’m interested in, and it makes a lot of sense to me, but it’s something I can never really live out. Being a female, with an attraction to gay men. I’ve told a friend before, that it feels like I’m a gay male at points, and mentally, I want to be that, but i would never go as far as changing my appearance or injecting T.

So, I guess what I’m wondering is; Does anyone else know what I’m feeling? Have a word for it? I’m just so confused with who I am, it’s making me feel helpless for not being able to find someone to be with that will make me happy because it’s so impossible to find someone I’m interested in to want to try that with me.",genderqueer,Extremely confused and hoping I’m not alone...,1567181464.0,"{'created_utc': 1567156264, 'id': 'cxee9c', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey, I created this account to see if I could find others that might be in the same boat as me. \n\nStory time?\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I’ve always been pretty comfortable with being a cis gendered female.

I might as well give you a little of my feelings before I get into anything else. I've always really loved girls clothes.

I am a male, 37 years old, married, doing well in my career and living a normal life to an outsider. 

But undisclosed to anyone, I carry a feminine side within me. A side that is soft, soothing, submissive and adorable. Secretly I wish I would have been a woman, and I guess that life would have more spontaneity and authenticity than my current life. I spend a lot of time daydreaming, imagining myself as a beautiful and intelligent woman who plays a major role in bringing good to the world. 

But, I do not think I am a full-scale transgender either. Because there are times when I am comfortable being a male and enjoying that. So I think both identities are indivisible parts of my psyche. So I think the genderfluid title suits me.

I am surrounded by a conservative family and society and so for the time being I do not have anyone to whom I can ""come out"" and share my feelings in the physical world I live in. I hope to relieve that pain a little by pouring my heart here. 

My body is hairless (less facial hair and chest hair) and smooth. If I cross-dress and put a wig (which I had done only a few times secretly), I would pass as a fairly attractive woman. I am concerned about my thinning hair though :( 

At school and College, I did not use to be much sporty like my peers. I was a bookworm(which I still am),writer and nerd. There were times when I was ridiculed for not being manly enough, and even being teased that I am a girl by bullies, and if I am honest, in spite of the embarrassment felt, I sometimes wished if I could have been a real girl! 

My sexuality is straight. It is women with whom I love to have sex. There was a time when I doubted whether I was gay because I had daydreams of men making love to me while I am in a female role, but then based on further insights it became clear to me that it is not the men who turns me on but the idea of my own femininity. The men in my daydreams just acted as a factor that validates my imagined femininity. However I have a wish to somehow befriending a ""dream man"" who would understand and respect my gender fluidity, who would not demand sex from me, but would still be affectionately romantic with my feminine side, someone to whom I can open up my heart when I feel feminine, but at the someone who understands that I am not always in the feminine mode and respects that. It might be unrealistic to even hope for that, but I do carry that wish in my heart. 

Speaking in general, I have a yearning to be accepted, respected for who I really am, and if possible be on the receiving side of affection. I yearn to be told that I am okay and perhaps receive a hug. Not sure if I am too old for that :(

When puberty hit I was so angry - I felt like I’d been duped about what my life would be like. And only recently have I realized that I have pretty much been unhappy at varying levels since then, and a lot of my drinking was suppressing my feelings of not belonging in my cis/het presenting life. Before I came to this realization I just had a sort of vague feeling like I was invisible or didn’t belong somehow.

91,2019-08-08 01:27:08,cneqdw,0,1,"So. Main (host) diagnosed with traumagenic DID by a therapist almost four years ago at age 35.   Rampant amnesia across my history but I've managed to piece it together via stories from friends and also just looking back over social media (Myspace was a minefield). As well as school yearbooks, etc.

I've posted a bit on DID forums but I'm trying to get a bit more information from other sources, because I'm still rather unsure and I don't want to offend anyone at all. My kids are all just barely adult, and I know from them that there are social norms and etiquette that I don't know. I don't want to or mean to offend anyone.

Basically I present as cisfemale. I use female pronouns, a female first name, and dress stereotypical female. I'm married to a man. But I am not just me, and of my adult alters, most are female and are either straight or bi.

However, I have two male alters. One is elderly and isn't interested in anything sexual or romantic at all, so far as I know. The other is male, bisexual, currently considers himself to be about 23, and while he first appeared when I was 7, his ascendence when the body was mid20s led to two years of binding, pixie cuts, and asking to be called by a masculine variation of the birth name.

He still presents, sometimes, and is a part of my psyche that I don't know how to make happy. I want to, but there are definite barriers with my current life.

So does that mean I am genderfluid? Or does the DID mean I'm not and it's just part of my diagnosis, this sense of being not one or the other, but either depending? 

I guess when you really get down to it, I am looking for validation. Can I, this middle aged woman body, identify as fluid because he comes out periodically and makes us a guy? Or do I not fit here and belong elsewhere? He's still a part of me/us. Sorry if this is the wrong sub or I offended anyone.

At that time I decided I wanted to get myself and others close to me used to using different pronouns. For instance I use Zizi instead of Aunt and ZaZa instead of mommy (I dont have children but I refer to myself as that to my beloved pets lol 🤪) And my husdband refers to me as his other half.

&amp;#x200B;

So about me, i am a 30 yo man. I never thought i was a woman or something. I am attracted to women.

&amp;#x200B;

However, i have a very big issue with my penis. I know it's attached to me, i want it to be attached to me, but it feels like it isn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weirdly enough, i've had sex for 10 years now but never did i even notice that i don't feel ANYTHING during sex or ejaculation. I was just going along with it, making sure the woman feels good.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't actually feel my penis, and it's like i don't have any object permanence with it - if it goes into a woman it's like i lost it or it's no longer mine. I understand it might sound weird, but it's like i don't feel it's mine.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if i were to stick my hand in the sand and move it or clench my fist, i could feel all the action with my hand and i will have some spatial awareness of where my hand is. This does NOT happen with my penis, it feels like i am in some sort of limbo when i have sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing about it made me realize i don't feel my penis even when it's flaccid or something, i can only feel my penis if i touch it with my hands or thighs or whatever. I can't, for the lack of a better word, feels things WITH my penis.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to masturbate and watch a lot of porn so i stopped that because i think it may be related to it.

I understand transgender. I've seen the research, seen the pain, and know it to be real. But gender fluidity has always confused me. Are you really a different gender each day as a trans person would be? 

For example, say you have a male body. When you are feeling female, is it that you are female in the brain (and thus hate or feel uncomfortable in the male body) or is it that you feel more feminine but can still be happy in your body?

233,2019-08-24 15:02:53,cuug07,2,3,"Hi, r/genderfluid! 


So, as the title suggests, I've got some questions about being genderfluid. I personally have been secretly struggling with what I identify as for a long time, about two days ago, I finally told some very close friends and they've said that Genderfluid sounds like it fits what I'm describing. I have been looking into it as much as I can, reading up on it, thinking it through in my head, and I also feel that it very accurately describes me. Though, I've got some questions about it. 


1. What does Genderfluid really mean to you? Like,if you were asked to describe what Genderfluid is, what would you say? 


2. Do you have to have both dysphoria and euphoria to be Genderfluid? I'm not sure if I've experienced dysphoria (if I have, it's not nearly as severe as I hear about it being for other people), though I do know I've experienced euphoria. 


3. How fast is too fast? Like, is finding a label that you think fits you in a few days too fast? I kind of feel like I'm going too fast with all this because some other friends I have who had to reevaluate their gender took months/years to figure out what they wanted to label themselves/identify as. I do very strongly feel that Genderfluid is accurate to how I've felt for years now, though. 


I feel much better going by they/them rather than she/her and feel that those pronouns fit me better. There's some days where I feel really feminine, some where I feel really masculine, and some days it's just kind of like ""Eh, I just exist"". I have looked at other identities, and I feel that Genderfluid is what fits me best. I came here to ask these questions just as part of really looking into this identity and making sure it's for me before taking any bigger steps.

I just recently started to come to terms with my gender identity, although I knew I am not a man since I was like 15, that's 12 years ago. It started in the silliest way, with a Halloween costume, I and a few friends dressed as women, and I still remember I felt right, like never before that. I already had long hair since I was a kid, and I was never interested in boy hobbies and play, but I never thought about it much. But that night was so amazing. I started wearing makeup and nail polish on a daily base, it was the goth fase, and I encountered so much hostility in my home town that it broke me. I also have borderline personality disorder and at the time I was experimenting a lot with drugs, so that plus the beatings I was getting on a weekly basis made me forget that part of me to survive. I was also a fervent catholic (strange I know) and that made me so ashamed of myself I started to cut myself as punishment. One of the most burning memories is of a very close friend of mine, after I kissed a guy on a party he came to me and said he'll hit me if he sees me doing something like that ever again. I just accepted it as normal, for years I didn't even ask myself what's going on with me, mostly because of fear of rejection. I passed 10 years of severe depression, although I stopped using drugs, I mostly had a job, my life was kinda taking a turn for the better but I was frozen in that miserable state and couldn't move an inch. At 20yo I got out of a seriously f**ked up relationship and for years i was alone, thinking who would ever want to be with such a human wreck, and after I tried to get a relationship going, she slapped me with the statement: you're not man enough for me. That's the last straw that cracked it all again. I was so depressed that every little stupid thing would make me cry, I would wake up crying, I even had to quit my job because I couldn't function properly anymore. Then it all came back to me, and I started questioning myself again. I'm still not sure who I am becoming, a lot of the homophobia and transphobia from my surroundings still sticks to me, but I finally started again being who I am. I had to change country six months ago to be able to do that, but even though at the moment I am alone as never before I am the happiest I have been in more than ten years. I can finally wear nail polish and make up even though I am visibly male, my roommates and a few colleagues who I came out to are supportive (it's such a pleasant surprise) and after the summer when the workload is lighter I want to start seeing a gender therapist. I don't know for now how far it goes, am I transfeminin, nonbinary, demigirl, all those words seem so confusing tbh, but I know I feel better than ever. Sorry for the rant, this was written in the fire of the moment, after lurking on reddit for a while, all of you made me finally feel like I'm not an abomination, thanks for that.

I thought on and off for years about possibly being full FTM trans, but dismissed it because there were times I definitely felt female and feminine. I also dismissed a lot of the masculine/male feelings because I was raised mostly around and by men, thus being a little tomboy. It wasn't until more recently that I realized it's not just being a tomboy, but actual ""some days if I could flip and switch and be biologically male, I would"", as well as highly considering HRT.

I was stressed to come out because unlike my sexuality, this wasn't something that was actually normalized growing up, nor have I really realized being fluid until recently. The one person I thought would give me all the support and love, and say I'm here for you no matter what was my best friend - we're close enough that we default to calling each other ""sister"" (to the point I do this with my biological brother, and he had to learn who I kept talking about, 'cause he knows I don't have a bio sister, and he wasn't married at the time.) She's always been super supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, will vocally fight for people in the community, and it's something we talk about frequently.   
But she didn't react how I thought she would.

She said because she's never heard me talk about it before, it had to just be a phase and even went as far as to accuse me of doing it to ""fit in"" with my new friends. I posted my coming out on *all* my social media, places where I didn't and still don't have the friends she was accusing me of trying to fit in with.

It was a bigger risk to harm my relationships with people, rather than strengthen them. She said IF (that word she did use) I am, she supports me, but she doesn't believe I am.

I'm a fairly closed off person, even with people close to me, so if I'm not certain about something, I'm not going to talk about it. I DID talk to her at one point about feeling like I was full other-side-of-the-scale trans, but she says she doesn't remember it (so apparently if she doesn't remember it, it didn't happen.)

I sent this to a few friends who I came out to and it was in a lot of separate messages so my apologies in advance for really bad formatting, bad grammar and spelling, and ranting in spots.

Here goes:

i found that now that i'm living on my own and am away from my family

and don't have to be forced to act how people think guys are supposed to act

i think i've been floating more in the realm of non-binary most of the time

i still get waves of feeling feminine and wanting to release my inner fem

but the waves of masculine feelings are subsiding and i've been just floating in between

i haven't come out yet and don't know how to

like to my roommates

but at the same time i really want to because i fucking hate having to act and dress and do everything a certain way

i fucking hate how people have gendered clothes and behaviors and been like ""oh well boys can't do this or wear that because that's for girls"" and same goes the other way

like thanks society for forcing me to hide myself while growing up and being forced to live in fucking constant fear and anxiety and stress because i was told i had to do shit a certain way

like

even when going to buy new clothes and shit i get weird looks and shit

if i want to try on this dress then let me try on this dress in peace

so what if i look like a dude

yall dont give other girls dirty looks for trying on guys clothes

why does it have to be so one sided

like if a woman is wearing sweatpants or a sports coat nobody bats an eye

but the second someone in the closet goes out and gets a dress to try on or anything fem and wears it in public

the whole world stops and it seems like everyone sees them as a weirdo and all shit hits the fan

women wearing suits in and shit is normal

why can't guys wearing dresses or skirts or skinny jeans and shit  be normal also

and as if that wasn't bad enough

if a guy goes into the womens underwear department

OOOOOOH LORD

GOD HELP US IF A GUY ENJOYS WEARING THEM BECAUSE SOME PAIRS ARE ACTUALLY MORE COMFORTABLE

another struggle im facing here is how everyone's like ""yea its a safe space dont be afraid to open up and talk to us about anything""

um excuse me do you know whats its like having to hide your true self for your whole life and be in constant fear of being judged or bullied because of that

i've already been bullied as a kid for shit

that's why i get really uncomfortable talking about some shit because my only memories of it are being fucking bullied for it

i did not expect this to turn out like this

im just really

frustrated

and feel lost sometimes

i have so much more to rant on about but i really don't know if it makes sense or anything

i haven't been in a class with any girls in like 4 years so i don't really know anyone and i also haven't come out to any girls here so i think it would be really weird and uncomfortable if all of a sudden i just went all fem and nobody knew why

like my friends over the summer knew because i came out to them and i was open

so it was a little easier

i was able to be with people who supported me and i came out to in class and it was a little less uncomfortable

but now everything is back to square one and i liked coming out because i had less anxiety

but now that im in this new place with different people, i'm back in the closet because im scared to come out again

i'm like a fucking turtle

come out when i feel safe and comfortable

and right back into hiding when i'm not comfortable

i feel safe here

don't get me wrong

but it's just that i feel weird seeing some people who the last time i saw was in middle school and all of a sudden im really different and this shit uncomfortable

sorry if this is in a weird format or if it jumps around a lot, i had so many thoughts and crap in my head that i needed to get out and i didn't think of formatting or flow.

   I guess there are many ways to express our different gender beliefs.  And often times it takes years to find out where we fit in on the gender spectrum.  Unfortunately it is a difficult journey and in most cultures a very painful one.  For the most part people don't see the need to explore any gender options and go with the fact that if you have a penis you are a boy and if you have a vagina you are a girl and accept all the trapping society imposes on you once you accept your condition as such.  So if you take this path and not buck society, you do avoid a lot of ridicule and suffering but for the most part, this path doesn't seem to lead to happiness and I strongly suspect you experience all the pain and suffering you tried to avoid by not being aware of your gender spectrum opportunities.  Because gender is just one aspect of self that needs to be explored and materialized in a way that you can live with yourself as well as relate to the society you were born into.  Mostly I try to avoid grossing people out because of my gender fluid attitude and have discovered the virtual world as a vehicle to fully express both sides of my gender issue without causing a lot of grief to myself or others.  Through awareness and un-attachment to how others rate me, I have actually been having fun with my gender fluid condition.

296,2019-08-30 16:50:04,cxjkgh,2,2,"Hi,
I've been in transition for about 5 years now and known I was trans for about 6, and since I've become aware that I'm trans, I've noticed my gender just straight up changing sometimes? Not on any regular basis, I can spend a year as typical binary trans girl, and then I wake up one morning and my gender, my dysphoria, what pronouns I like, how I want to express my gender is completely different. I became much more aware of this pattern about a year ago when I went from binary trans girl to completely neutral pretty much instantly, suddenly she/her pronouns felt invalidating so I started going by they/them, I became dysphoric about my breasts and started wearing a binder for frankly unhealthy amounts of time, and I had to cut my hair which I had been growing out for over a year, stop wearing dresses in favor of button down shirts and bowties just because of how at odds my presentation felt with my gender and how much I hated being referred to with she/her pronouns, I couldn't even stand being called cute because it seemed too feminine (I know cute isn't necessary a girl-only adjective, that's just how I felt at the time).
Fast forward to about 6 months ago and suddenly my gender shifts again! To something like 65-80% girl. I felt euphoric about my breasts again, started dressing more traditionally femininely and started growing out my hair again because suddenly I hated it being short and I switched my pronouns back to she/her.
This is just the most obvious recent example, this has happened a lot before and I do not understand it, and frankly I am a little scared that it'll happen again, I don't know if this is being genderfluid nor what and I'm hoping you kind folks might be able to help me understand this a bit better.
